Magnet asks. 'And how did it come into being at the moment the US economy started booming just as we had passed the 1964 Civil Rights act?' It's a question to which Magnet, with his bushy sideburns and amiable manner of character from Charles Dickens, thinks he knows the answer.</p> <p>Unlike many conservative gurus, Magnet does not locate the root of the problem in the personal failings of the poor, but in the attitudes of the middle-classes that took root during that period. The culture that has victimised the have-nots, he argues, is the culture of the haves - specifically radical individualism and personal liberation.</p> <p>'We devalued all of the things you have to do to get out of poverty, like hard work, personal responsibility, getting married and taking care of family, staying in school, and we highly valued all the things that if you're poor and you do them you'll stay poor forever, like taking drugs, having children out of wedlock, dropping out and not being serious about work.'</p> <p>Efforts to break the cycle of poverty, such as welfare programmes, job training, and quota systems for minorities, failed because government failed to understand that the underclass is less an economic matter than a cultural one. 'The ideas themselves created the reality, not economic changes or the failure of government programmes,' he says.

If Magnet's analysis sounds like simplistic conservative politics, it is not. It draws far more heavily on Freud than Marxist theorists who hold human behaviour is little more than a condition of larger economic and social forces. Magnet and with other theorists behind 'compassionate conservatism' feel they have the wind behind them. They cite President Bill Clinton's cutback of welfare programmes in 1996 as an unequivocal success in transforming the lot of the poor. The foremost proof of the policy lies in the turnaround of New York. 'Nobody predicted that the so-called hard cases are finding employment at the same rate as everybody else,' he says.</p> <p>In getting the liberal elites to engage in a discussion on the causes of social problems or to raise the idea that the poor can help themselves, Magnet has frequently been branded a bigot. Mayor Rudi Giuliani, who says he has been influenced by Magnet, calls the political correctness that rules New York intellectual life 'like the Spanish Inquisition'.</p> <p>Bush read The Dream and the Nightmare in 1998 while preparing to run for his second term as governor of Texas and invited Magnet for a brainstorming session. Magnet's ideas made their way into almost every Bush campaign speech.</p> <p>Magnet draws much of his inspiration from Victorian England where a generation of reformers effected a transformation that turned a gin-swilling nation with a high bastardy rate into a country with strong families and prosperity. 'I know this sounds like hopeless Victorian schoolmistress talk,' he says, 'but the lesson can be applied to America and Britain in 2001. You just need to say, \"come on fellas, shape up\". Everybody has to be held responsible for their actions.</p> <p>'In rich open societies like England and the US, anybody can be part of the mainstream.

This may have changed now. </p> <p>'A lot of the frothier business plans, the me-too con cepts, have sunk. The quality of businesses and of intellectual property being built is now far better and more bankable,' says Prince. </p> <p>Mason estimates there are 20,000-40,000 business angels investing \u00a31 billion in up to 6,000 companies a year in the UK. This funding plays a vital role in giving the initial impetus to early-stage start-ups, which tend to be overlooked by venture capitalists. Precise figures are impossible to obtain because many angel investors do not want to volunteer their status. But it is clear they are a vital cog in the workings of an entrepre neurial culture. 'The average entrepreneur doesn't need \u00a35 million to get an idea off the ground - it's, say, \u00a3100,000,' says Meyer, who now runs Ariadne Capital. And if they don't happen to have a rich uncle, many good ideas can go unfunded. </p> <p>Unsurprisingly, angel investment culture is very different and more developed in the US. Some $40 billion is estimated to be invested by angels over there. </p> <p>'Europe is dominated by families who made it in the old economy,' says Meyer, who has toured the Continent looking to connect businesses. 'They will invest if they know one or two things about it, otherwise they won't touch it. Then they give the nod to a whole network of friends across Europe and they'll all come in. </p> <p>'In the US there are these under-35 year olds, as new money as it comes, who are driven by recycling entrepreneurial wealth and know-how, as well as making more money,' she says. </p> <p>Indeed despite the cash crunch, this passing on of know-how and contacts often proves more important than the funding itself.

For older members who have already made their millions, it is a chance to replay the entrepreneurship game by proxy.

'If you invest, it can be a lucrative activity.' </p> <p>But there is an all-pervading spirit of community entrepreneurship. And TiE has just opened in London.

If so, when and who will pay for it? </p> <p>Railtrack has admitted it is in no position to deliver on its promises, with its value decimated after it ignored the broken rail that caused last year's Hatfield crash. </p> <p>Keith Ludeman, chief executive of Go-Ahead rail, which runs the Thames Trains and Thameslink routes and has just won the London south-central franchise from the despised Connex, said: 'The pace of developing this shiny new railway will be a lot slower than anticipated 18 months ago. And there is a logic that suggests the Strategic Rail Authority will backstop some of the risk.' </p> <p>In other words, forget those early promises and also assume that the taxpayer will supply a greater proportion of the money needed by the industry, via the Government and its agent, the SRA. </p> <p>Ludeman believes that it will take up to 10 years before the public sees the high-speed Channel Tunnel Rail Link, upgrades of the west and east coast lines linking Glasgow and Edinburgh with London, the north-south Thameslink project across the capital, some improvements in the Home Counties and automatic safety systems. Hopefully. And that's it. </p> <p>Everything else, such as modernising the great western line, an east-west link across London, and big expansions around Manchester and Birmingham are on the back burner - perhaps permanently. </p> <p>Even the most likely projects will come at the cost of major disruption to travel and a much greater level of subsidy than previously anticipated as private-sector investors take fright at the sight of Railtrack disintegrating and huge cost overruns and delays on many major projects. </p> <p>But, crucially, Ludeman believes that a new kind of investment vehicle being devised by the SRA to take on these projects can be made to work and this is what will deliver an improved railway - better late and more expensive than never. </p> <p>GoVia, the partnership between Go-Ahead and a subsidiary of the French national railway, SNCF, plans to invest in new trains and infrastructure to produce better services in return for a 20-year contract. </p> <p>But GoVia will also spend the coming months with US construction firm Bechtel, its fellow investor, Railtrack, and the SRA working out everyone's stakes in a \u00a31.5 billion investment vehicle designed to cost, finance and produce the project. </p> <p>If a deal can be done, the SRA is expected to contribute grants and agree guaranteed rates of return with GoVia - rumoured to be up to 15 per cent - or underwrite a certain level of risk as the taxpayer's part in the venture. </p> <p>Ludeman said: 'There is no model yet but we are developing one.

Two days later, company boss Steve Marshall will reveal he needs an extra \u00a33bn from Winsor, on top of the \u00a315bn already agreed, over the next five years to cover higher running costs. This is likely to prompt Winsor to exercise his right to refer the company to the Competition Commission.",

At these marches were relatives of dead IRA Volunteers, former hunger strikers, ex-escapees, former prisoners, as well as thousands of supporters.</p> <p>The speaker at the 32-CSM commemoration in Dublin said that they had small numbers and were being vilified just like the men and women of 1916. On other occasions dissidents have likened their splitting from mainstream republicans in Sinn Fein and the IRA as a re-run of the split in 1969. At that time the Republican Movement divided into the 'Officials' and 'the Provisionals' (today's Sinn Fein and IRA).</p> <p>However, the Real IRA will never be able to replicate the IRA's firepower and thus bring the British to the negotiating table. The 32-CSM has no popular support, has failed to produce a cogent leadership, and lacks a credible political programme.</p> <p>Whereas the Officials went into decline after the 1972 cease-fire, Sinn Fein's popularity has risen since the IRA's cessation of August 1994, to the extent that they may hold the balance of power after the next election. Dissidents rely on exploiting growing republican disquiet at Britain's mishandling of the peace process, but that anger is unlikely to be directed at the Sinn Fein leadership or be channelled into substantial support for dissidents.</p> <p>In its constitution, 32-CSM states: 'We hold that all administrations and assemblies purporting to act as lawful government for the Irish people, or otherwise functioning as partitionist entities, to be illegal...' But how can its leaders square this belated purism with the fact that for 11 years (from 1986 until 1997) they were part of the Republican Movement which had dropped its policy of abstentionism towards that 'partitionist' entity, the Dail? At least former president Ruairi O Bradaigh had the honesty to leave and form Republican Sinn Fein.</p> <p>If the 32-CSM and the Real IRA really believes in the 1916 analogy then they should go back to first principles, contest elections on an abstentionist ticket and set up an all-Ireland assembly in opposition to what the electorates have overwhelmingly voted for - the Good Friday Agreement. Similarly, its members should refuse to recognise the courts. That would be absurd, and they know it.</p> <p>Those who split from the Republican Movement in 1997 to form the Real IRA and the 32-CSM did so because they refused to go along with or respect the opinion of the majority.</p> <p>The 32-CSM's principal alternative to the Sinn Fein project of bringing about a new Ireland is remarkably na\u00efve: pressing Ireland's right to sovereignty and independence at the United Nations. Ask the Palestinians about UN Resolution 242 and what it has done for their freedom.</p> <p>Tragically, the Real IRA will continue with its sporadic campaign, continue to kill innocent people and lose its own volunteers to cemetery and jail until some member has the guts to face up to the futility of the campaign. They and the 32-CSM have no message for the unionist people, do not understand that the building of trust, the normalisation of relations with the unionists, preparatory cross-border social and economic harmonisation, the building of a strong, all-Ireland republican party, are all part of the struggle for Irish re-unification.</p> <p>\u0095 Danny Morrison is a writer and a former director of publicity for Sinn Fein.</p>",

At these marches were relatives of dead IRA Volunteers, former hunger strikers, ex-escapees, former prisoners, as well as thousands of supporters. The speaker at the 32-CSM commemoration in Dublin said that they had small numbers and were being vilified just like the men and women of 1916. On other occasions dissidents have likened their splitting from mainstream republicans in Sinn Fein and the IRA as a re-run of the split in 1969. At that time the Republican Movement divided into the 'Officials' and 'the Provisionals' (today's Sinn Fein and IRA). However, the Real IRA will never be able to replicate the IRA's firepower and thus bring the British to the negotiating table. The 32-CSM has no popular support, has failed to produce a cogent leadership, and lacks a credible political programme. Whereas the Officials went into decline after the 1972 cease-fire, Sinn Fein's popularity has risen since the IRA's cessation of August 1994, to the extent that they may hold the balance of power after the next election. Dissidents rely on exploiting growing republican disquiet at Britain's mishandling of the peace process, but that anger is unlikely to be directed at the Sinn Fein leadership or be channelled into substantial support for dissidents. In its constitution, 32-CSM states: 'We hold that all administrations and assemblies purporting to act as lawful government for the Irish people, or otherwise functioning as partitionist entities, to be illegal...' But how can its leaders square this belated purism with the fact that for 11 years (from 1986 until 1997) they were part of the Republican Movement which had dropped its policy of abstentionism towards that 'partitionist' entity, the Dail? At least former president Ruairi O Bradaigh had the honesty to leave and form Republican Sinn Fein. If the 32-CSM and the Real IRA really believes in the 1916 analogy then they should go back to first principles, contest elections on an abstentionist ticket and set up an all-Ireland assembly in opposition to what the electorates have overwhelmingly voted for - the Good Friday Agreement. Similarly, its members should refuse to recognise the courts. That would be absurd, and they know it. Those who split from the Republican Movement in 1997 to form the Real IRA and the 32-CSM did so because they refused to go along with or respect the opinion of the majority. The 32-CSM's principal alternative to the Sinn Fein project of bringing about a new Ireland is remarkably na\u00efve: pressing Ireland's right to sovereignty and independence at the United Nations. Ask the Palestinians about UN Resolution 242 and what it has done for their freedom. Tragically, the Real IRA will continue with its sporadic campaign, continue to kill innocent people and lose its own volunteers to cemetery and jail until some member has the guts to face up to the futility of the campaign. They and the 32-CSM have no message for the unionist people, do not understand that the building of trust, the normalisation of relations with the unionists, preparatory cross-border social and economic harmonisation, the building of a strong, all-Ireland republican party, are all part of the struggle for Irish re-unification. \u0095 Danny Morrison is a writer and a former director of publicity for Sinn Fein.",

Only a day after Israel bombarded Syrian radar positions in Lebanon, The Observer can reveal that a busload of 50 Israeli Palestinians rolled into the Syrian capital, Damascus, in a confidence-building measure to end 52 years of ruptured family relations. Brother hugged brother, mothers swooned over sons, as hundreds of Palestinian refugees thronged the bus station to greet the arrivals from Israel. Syria had invited the Palestinians, who travelled on Syrian passes rather than their Israeli passports, to rejoin relatives in Syria's refugee camps for a week. 'It's like a wedding, as if our lost brothers had descended from heaven,' said Majid Abu Ras as he hugged his brother, Ibrahim Yassine, a retired builder from across the enemy lines. Majid, a grocer in Yarmuk Camp, had been only six when he last saw his brother in 1948. Then the Israeli army chased Ibrahim and their parents away from Ailut, a hamlet three miles from Nazareth. Now both men are grandfathers. Observers hailed the reunification project as more ground- breaking than the reuniting of relatives across the divide between North and South Korea. For the past 50 years, Israel has banned its citizens from visiting enemy states, fearing it would turn Israeli Arabs into a fifth column, and Syria has banned entry by Palestinians holding Israeli passports. Azmi Bishara, an Israeli Arab MP who was in Damascus for the arrival of the bus, said the project was 'a credit to the new approach' of the Syrian President, Bashar al-Assad.

In an article detailing her chequered tenure as editor of the Independent on Sunday , Street-Porter announces: 'I accept that I'm loud, larger than life, and common.' There it was, the word 'common', here being employed self-empoweringly and humourously, and not, as was traditional, in an attempt to terrorise the aspirant working classes and keep them down. As anybody who knows me to any great degree could testify, there's nothing I like better than a bit of class war.

Quite what consolation cuts in interest rates will be to businesses that have overinvested and are now issuing dire profit warnings remains to be seen. At least the Fed is not tightening monetary policy to make things worse. </p> <p>It was acute observation of the linkages between the US and UK economies and financial systems that led the so called 'doves' on the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee to break ranks from the 'don't panic' Basle Consensus of central bankers in January. The 'doves' have led the case for lower interest rates here, and have been joined, at a slower pace, by the others.

It is not as if the eurozone is in anything like the position of the US economy. The eurozone endured nearly a decade of sluggish growth in order to fit itself into the self-imposed straitjacket of the Maastricht budgetary criteria, and then enjoyed a very minor period of reasonable growth. Now it is being hit by the repercussion of the US slowdown and the increasingly disturbing recession in Japan - and doing nothing about it. </p> <p>It has to be said that the ECB is stretching the patience of the most pro-European of observers.

'We're not going to be fooled by clerics, by politicians, by theologians, by liturgists.

During the week it was also reported that in the Diocese of Kerry, which includes part of west Cork and is one of the biggest in Ireland, only two students are preparing for the priesthood.</p> <p>Meanwhile, however, the Th\u00e9r\u00e8semobile continues on its Irish tour. There is only one blight on the horizon: foot and mouth disease in the North could disrupt the planned visits there between 20 May and 2 June. But, as Rev Ian Paisley, chair of the NI Assembly Agriculture committee, recently observed on attempts to stop the outbreak: 'Prayer is a great wonder-worker.'</p>",

They may be the main target of Bishop Comiskey's remarks, as he welcomed the relics to Ireland last Sunday. Criticising 'self-styled intellectuals', concerned about the involvement of the 'peasantry' in events such as the St Th\u00e9r\u00e8se tour, he roundly denied that it was superstition or 'worshipping bones'. 'Listen, us people out in the heartlands, we're not as easily fooled as people who worry about us in ivory towers think,' he declared. 'We're not going to be fooled by clerics, by politicians, by theologians, by liturgists. Those people who worry about relics, they don't mind spending a few thousand pounds for Bono's sweater or glasses.' It was a message guaranteed to go to the heart of Irish religious traditionalists, for whom St Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, the French Carmelite nun who died of tuberculosis at the age of 24 in 1879 and was canonised in 1925, remains almost on a par with the Virgin Mary. Her claims of the Virgin's appearance to her at the age of 10, curing her of illness, including hallucinations and possibly anorexia nervosa, are widely accepted by the faithful as true. The recently elevated Cardinal Desmond Connell, an academic rather than a pastoral priest by background, stands for Papal orthodoxy, strictly supporting the humanae vitae ban on artificial contraception, despite widespread public defiance, and currently calling for another Irish referendum to strengthen the law against abortion. Last week, ordaining students at St Patrick's College, Maynooth, he insisted that church celibacy was 'more fundamental than law', and must be preserved. Significant numbers of his clergy will find that message unhelpful, as the number of priests ordained nationally continues to decline. During the week it was also reported that in the Diocese of Kerry, which includes part of west Cork and is one of the biggest in Ireland, only two students are preparing for the priesthood. Meanwhile, however, the Th\u00e9r\u00e8semobile continues on its Irish tour. There is only one blight on the horizon: foot and mouth disease in the North could disrupt the planned visits there between 20 May and 2 June. But, as Rev Ian Paisley, chair of the NI Assembly Agriculture committee, recently observed on attempts to stop the outbreak: 'Prayer is a great wonder-worker.'",

      "body": "<p>They are said to be reluctant to forsake the pleasures of single life. But nothing could be further from the truth. British women are much more attached to marriage than their European counterparts. Around 95.1 per cent of British women have married at least once by age 49, the highest figure in the European Union. Only 91.2 per cent of British men have walked up the aisle by the same age.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the much discussed trend for delaying marriage until later in life - blamed on career women reluctant to have children - may actually reflect a return to the historical norm.</p> <p>The average age of first marriage in Europe 200 years ago was 28, the same as British brides in 1998, according to a paper for the National Family and Parenting Institute, the independent thinktank set up by Jack Straw to advise on family issues.</p> <p>'The public conversation about marriage has often been conducted in an atmosphere fraught with anxiety that can easily tip over into what commentators have described as a \"moral panic\",' the report, comparing European trends in marriage, adds.</p> <p>'Changes in the marriage rate and in the way people form relationships are part and parcel of a society where change is rapid and individuals feel helpless in the face of new developments. Yet it is vital that these issues can be discussed without blame.'</p> <p>The paper does not include divorce rates. In 1997 Britain had the highest divorce rate in Europe, although by 1999 the rate had fallen to the level of the late 1980s.</p> <p>Despite much political consternation about the family, the report suggests British attitudes are more socially conservative than those of many EU counterparts.</p> <p>Nine out of 10 couples in Britain living with their children are married, compared to half in Finland. And while cohabiting is becoming the norm for European twentysomethings, 'change has happened much more rapidly across the whole of the EU than in the UK', the report finds. Around a third of British under-thirties live with a partner, but it is closer to half in France and 40 per cent in Germany.</p> <p>'This report is about let's bring a cool head to this debate,' said Gill Keep, head of policy at the institute. 'It is much easier to take the panic out of the discussion if you look at it in a comparative way. Things that you think are destroying your own society are actually common trends and they may not be that destructive.'</p> <p>She said that despite anxiety over later marriages - the average age of first-time brides rose from 23 in the postwar period to 28 for women and 30 for men by 1999 - historically this would have seemed normal.</p> <p>Social historian Christina Hardyment said that in the nineteenth century couples would not marry until they could afford to support a household. 'Women below the middle classes would always work in some capacity, mainly in domestic service, and it made sense to save. People think of kings and queens and nobility being married off at 12 but that was highly unusual,' she said.</p> <p>The institute's report found the Government lagged behind many EU counterparts in spending on families - just over 8.7 per cent of its total welfare spending went on family and child benefits in 2000, putting it joint tenth out of 15 countries, although since then new tax credits have been introduced.</p> <p>It is also behind on civil registration for unmarried couples, and on some allowances for family life. Six countries even offer paid leave for getting married, of between a day and two weeks.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:gaby.hinsliff@observer.co.uk\">gaby.hinsliff@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

Around 95.1 per cent of British women have married at least once by age 49, the highest figure in the European Union. Only 91.2 per cent of British men have walked up the aisle by the same age. Meanwhile, the much discussed trend for delaying marriage until later in life - blamed on career women reluctant to have children - may actually reflect a return to the historical norm. The average age of first marriage in Europe 200 years ago was 28, the same as British brides in 1998, according to a paper for the National Family and Parenting Institute, the independent thinktank set up by Jack Straw to advise on family issues. 'The public conversation about marriage has often been conducted in an atmosphere fraught with anxiety that can easily tip over into what commentators have described as a \"moral panic\",' the report, comparing European trends in marriage, adds. 'Changes in the marriage rate and in the way people form relationships are part and parcel of a society where change is rapid and individuals feel helpless in the face of new developments. Yet it is vital that these issues can be discussed without blame.' The paper does not include divorce rates. In 1997 Britain had the highest divorce rate in Europe, although by 1999 the rate had fallen to the level of the late 1980s. Despite much political consternation about the family, the report suggests British attitudes are more socially conservative than those of many EU counterparts. Nine out of 10 couples in Britain living with their children are married, compared to half in Finland. And while cohabiting is becoming the norm for European twentysomethings, 'change has happened much more rapidly across the whole of the EU than in the UK', the report finds. Around a third of British under-thirties live with a partner, but it is closer to half in France and 40 per cent in Germany. 'This report is about let's bring a cool head to this debate,' said Gill Keep, head of policy at the institute. 'It is much easier to take the panic out of the discussion if you look at it in a comparative way. Things that you think are destroying your own society are actually common trends and they may not be that destructive.' She said that despite anxiety over later marriages - the average age of first-time brides rose from 23 in the postwar period to 28 for women and 30 for men by 1999 - historically this would have seemed normal. Social historian Christina Hardyment said that in the nineteenth century couples would not marry until they could afford to support a household. 'Women below the middle classes would always work in some capacity, mainly in domestic service, and it made sense to save. People think of kings and queens and nobility being married off at 12 but that was highly unusual,' she said. The institute's report found the Government lagged behind many EU counterparts in spending on families - just over 8.7 per cent of its total welfare spending went on family and child benefits in 2000, putting it joint tenth out of 15 countries, although since then new tax credits have been introduced. It is also behind on civil registration for unmarried couples, and on some allowances for family life. Six countries even offer paid leave for getting married, of between a day and two weeks. gaby.hinsliff@observer.co.uk",

Experts, who fear Britain may be on the verge of a TB epidemic, last week called for the number of lung specialists to be doubled. They say control of the disease is being hampered by incorrect diagnosis and long waiting times for proper treatment. Dr John Moore-Gillon, a TB specialist in London, said: 'The longest delays in TB diagnosis happen in areas where there is a low instance of TB. It takes a while for the penny to drop. 'There has been a nationwide increase in cases of TB of 11 per cent. In London it's as high as 20 per cent. Areas that were once seeing intermediate amounts of TB are now seeing a lot more.' A recent report from the British Thoracic Society revealed that only six of the 43 areas worst affected by TB in the UK had adequate staffing levels, and that this directly affected control and diagnosis of the disease. Doctors who are not familiar with the disease are having to deal with it more often, it said. A study by TB specialists in east London, published by the BTS last year, concluded that stricter monitoring of TB cases should be implemented as 'undernotification [of authorities that patients have the disease] has been shown to be a significant problem'. Misdiagnosis can have tragic consequences, allowing infected people to spread TB, and the disease to cause irreversible damage. Last week Britain grew closer to a full-scale TB epidemic when it emerged that eight pupils at Duffryn High School in Newport, Gwent, had contracted the disease. The entire school population of 1,100 is to be screened. Under 100 miles away, all 1,300 patients admitted to part of Cheltenham General Hospital, Gloucestershire, during the past year are to be screened after a nurse there was diagnosed with TB.

'It must now answer the very serious question of whether it gradually transforms unwary cricket-loving boys into brooding, insecure and ultimately self-destructive men.'</p> <p>The suicide rate among British men is 1.07 per cent, but according to Frith's research, the rate among cricketers here is 1.77 per cent - making them 75 per cent more likely to take their own life.</p> <p>But the game's toll overseas is even higher.

      "bodyText": "English cricketers are almost twice as likely to commit suicide as the average male and have a suicide rate higher than players of any other sport, according to an international study. Sussex and Somerset, counties whose sweeping grounds have spawned scores of great players including Ted Dexter and current Test bowler Andy Caddick, have the highest suicide rates in the country, according to David Frith, author of Silence of the Heart , an investigation into the phenomenon. The findings have disturbed Britain's cricketing world and pose the question of whether cricket attracts vulnerable people or whether the game has a unique capacity to destabilise its players. 'Cricket has this dreadful, hidden burden,' said Frith, one of Britain's best-known cricket writers and a former editor of Wisden Cricket Monthly . 'It must now answer the very serious question of whether it gradually transforms unwary cricket-loving boys into brooding, insecure and ultimately self-destructive men.' The suicide rate among British men is 1.07 per cent, but according to Frith's research, the rate among cricketers here is 1.77 per cent - making them 75 per cent more likely to take their own life. But the game's toll overseas is even higher. In South Africa 4.12 per cent of players take their own lives. In New Zealand the rate is 3.92 per cent and in Australia 2.75 per cent. 'There is a relative consolation from knowing that Britain's rate is below that of other countries but the worry is that in general, cricket's casualty rate is way above the general average,' said Frith. Frith believes that, instead of susceptible people being attracted to the game, cricket puts a strain on nerves that can be as destructive as the post-traumatic stress disorder suffered by war veterans. 'It is the uncertainty, day in and day out, that plays a sinister beat on the cricketer's soul,' he said. 'Golfers, footballers, tennis players and boxers all have an assurance that they have a chance to recover from early defeat in the game but cricket embodies uncertainty on the grand scale and on a relentless daily basis. 'The nature of cricket is such that it tears at the nerves. Half-hearted cricketers are extremely rare. This game gets a grip on people such as only religious fanatics might recognise. 'There is a compulsive nature to the game and an inherent uncertainty which could damage the soul.' The majority of the suicides over the past 30 years took place in the Eighties and Nineties, with the fewest in the Sixties, and were of players aged between 40 and 49 who had been forced into retirement. Famous cricket suicides include A.E. Stoddart, the most glamorous cricketer of the 1880s and captain of England from 1894, who shot himself in 1915 after his career ended; Albert Shrewsbury, the finest professional batsman of his day; and William Scotton. Stoddart and Shrewsbury walked out to open the batting for England on 17 July 1893, passing another suicide-to-be, Australia's Billy Bruce, days after the funeral of Scotton, who had killed himself at his home near Lord's. David Bairstow, the burly, life-loving Yorkshire captain, killed himself in 1998 aged 46, joining sporting heroes Sid Barnes and Jack Iverson. Hansie Cronje, the shamed South African captain, has said he came close to committing suicide after the match-fixing scandal broke. Frith believes the recent increase in recorded suicides could be the result of a waning in the stigma surrounding the act and a new willingness to identify it as cause of death. 'Logic insists that there must be many other suicides still unrevealed,' he said. 'And many that will always remain so.' The solution, he believes, is for former players to stay connected with the game through broadcasting, umpiring or coaching, after they have retired. Mike Brearley, the former England captain, is not sure cricket is to blame for the heavy toll it takes on the lives of its players. 'The uncertainty of cricket is not always glorious or exciting; it can be disillusioning and anxiety-creating,' he said. 'And then, after their career is over, many ex-cricketers feel they have been lured into prostituting their name to fit in with the starstruck desires of others. 'These men lose their authenticity and that humiliation, which contrasts dramatically with the excitement and successes that went before, can be terrible. 'But it is not cricket which causes suicide: people kill themselves for reasons that are internal to themselves and their histories.' amelia.hill@observer.co.uk",

      "body": "<p>There is something very wrong at Ipswich. 'There's only one David Sheepshanks,' sang Portman Road. Fans chanting a eulogy to the chairman? It's just not normal. </p> <p>But then, neither is this season Ipswich Town are having. Yesterday, goals by Martin Reuser and the excellent Jermaine Wright were scant reward for their dominance over a Coventry City side who had been on something of a roll but now look destined for relegation. At the other end, it will be something of a shock if Ipswich, in their first season back in the Premiership, do not now make the Champions League. </p> <p>Going through the fixtures when they were published last summer, if you looked at Ipswich's kindly last five matches you would have concluded that they would at least have a good chance of saving themselves, with games against potential fellow relegation strugglers in Middlesbrough, Coventry, Charlton, Manchester City and Derby County. </p> <p>Instead, they will have a significant say in who does go down, they themselves long since safe in riposte to those who expected them to struggle, and - more importantly from their point of view - they now have an astonishing opportunity to grab a Champions League place. </p> <p>Coventry are one such scrapping for survival - yet again - and came to Portman Road with a splendid recent record. A bank holiday Monday win over Sunderland was amends for a defeat, a plucky one at that, at Manchester United to make it three wins from four games. Ipswich, though, were in excellent order themselves, with four wins from five. </p> <p>It showed in their approach.

      "bodyText": "There is something very wrong at Ipswich. 'There's only one David Sheepshanks,' sang Portman Road. Fans chanting a eulogy to the chairman? It's just not normal. But then, neither is this season Ipswich Town are having. Yesterday, goals by Martin Reuser and the excellent Jermaine Wright were scant reward for their dominance over a Coventry City side who had been on something of a roll but now look destined for relegation. At the other end, it will be something of a shock if Ipswich, in their first season back in the Premiership, do not now make the Champions League. Going through the fixtures when they were published last summer, if you looked at Ipswich's kindly last five matches you would have concluded that they would at least have a good chance of saving themselves, with games against potential fellow relegation strugglers in Middlesbrough, Coventry, Charlton, Manchester City and Derby County. Instead, they will have a significant say in who does go down, they themselves long since safe in riposte to those who expected them to struggle, and - more importantly from their point of view - they now have an astonishing opportunity to grab a Champions League place. Coventry are one such scrapping for survival - yet again - and came to Portman Road with a splendid recent record. A bank holiday Monday win over Sunderland was amends for a defeat, a plucky one at that, at Manchester United to make it three wins from four games. Ipswich, though, were in excellent order themselves, with four wins from five. It showed in their approach. With Matt Holland providing the drive and Jim Magilton the subtlety, Ipswich soon wrested control of central midfield. In addition, Jermaine Wright and Martin Reuser were finding space on the flanks and there was a snap to Ipswich's game, a sharpness in the tackle and a slickness to their passing, that made Coventry look ponderous and a shadow of the side of last weekend.

Then Kirkland was beaten again and this time it counted. In another incisive move, Armstrong found Wright and although Holland missed his low cross, Reuser arrived at the far post, beyond John Eustace, and steered the ball home gleefully. Little was seen of Coventry as an attacking force, so much were they pinned back. It scarcely mattered to Ipswich, who came close to a second when Kirkland dived to save Wright's low drive, that Richard Wright had injured his back in the pre-match warm-up, giving Keith Branagan a start in goal instead. The huge oversight for Coventry was that they were not getting the ball to John Hartson in any dangerous areas. It was clearly something Gordon Strachan seized upon at the interval as Coventry came out with new intent for the second half, Hartson at the hub of their work.

He saw his effort from a narrow angle cleared off the line by Jaap Stam. </p> <p>United let the first half pass them by, apart from an Ole Gunnar Solskjaer effort in the 44th minute that brought a sharp save from Carlo Nash, and were equally unimpressive in the second until a hesitant defender's run into the opposition penalty box by Brown was stopped by a clumsy, attacker's challenge from Paul Dickov. </p> <p>This at least allayed suspicions that the teams had agreed on a draw, although when Paul Scholes rolled the spot kick wide the case for a steward's inquiry was on again, or would have been had not City generously coughed up a second penalty 10 minutes layer. This time it was the habitually clumsy Richard Dunne, accidentally catching Solskjaer's heel, and though Barthez ran upfield offering his services United refused to let an important Premiership fixture for the relegation end of the table degenerate into a testimonial-type farce. </p> <p>The new footballer of the year took the penalty instead, Teddy Sheringham scoring his 21st goal of the season despite Nash's brave attempt to save. </p> <p>The usual script involves United scoring two or three more before the final whistle to make a pedestrian victory look impressive in the record books, but they took their eye off the ball seven minutes from the end when David Beckham unintentionally glanced on Dickov's corner to allow Steve Howey to sweep in at the far post. 'A draw was fair,' Joe Royle said. 'We haven't had many breaks this season, and I thought when the first penalty was missed it might be our day, but when the second one went in we did well to come back.' </p> <p>Ferguson was far less pleased with his own team's efforts.

      "body": "<p>Rangers had no difficulty in brushing Dundee aside to confirm their European Champions League spot - partly because of the number of times Dundee let them off the hook through poor finishing. </p> <p>The home team were given an early lesson in the art when Rod Wallace fastened on to a Bert Konterman punt over the top of their defence to put Rangers ahead after four minutes. </p> <p>But Dundee then wasted three chances to equalise. The most glaring miss came from Girogi Nemsadze, who with only the keeper, Stefan Klos, to beat shot straight at him. </p> <p>Tore Andre Flo increased Rangers' lead after 16 minutes, and following further Dundee misses - notably by Juan Sara - Jorg Albertz made it 3-0 from 25 yards just before half time. </p> <p>Motherwell also missed good chances at home to St Johnstone, and were punished for it when the latter's Mohammed Sylla scored the only goal. </p> <p>It was one of the few highlights in a dull match, as was Arild Stavrum's goal - his 14th of the season - in Aberdeen's 1-0 win against Dunfermline. </p> <p>The Scottish FA are to reconsider their criteria for entry into their international football Hall of Fame. </p> <p>At present, players need to gain at least 50 caps to be included. However, one notable omission is that of Jim Baxter, who died last week and was only capped 34 times. </p> <p>It is not difficult to appreciate why the SFA are considering moving the goalposts. As Scotland's coach, Craig Brown, said: 'In the old days before substitutes, only 11 players would get a cap for a match and there were fewer matches. For example, I am allowed seven substitutes in next week's friendly ion Poland. That means that there could be as many as 18 caps awarded. In the old days, you probably would not get that many in a whole season.' </p> <p>But one player unlikely to take part in the Poland game is the Rangers captain, Barry Ferguson, who is poised to withdraw from the squad because of rib injury.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Rangers had no difficulty in brushing Dundee aside to confirm their European Champions League spot - partly because of the number of times Dundee let them off the hook through poor finishing. The home team were given an early lesson in the art when Rod Wallace fastened on to a Bert Konterman punt over the top of their defence to put Rangers ahead after four minutes. But Dundee then wasted three chances to equalise. The most glaring miss came from Girogi Nemsadze, who with only the keeper, Stefan Klos, to beat shot straight at him. Tore Andre Flo increased Rangers' lead after 16 minutes, and following further Dundee misses - notably by Juan Sara - Jorg Albertz made it 3-0 from 25 yards just before half time. Motherwell also missed good chances at home to St Johnstone, and were punished for it when the latter's Mohammed Sylla scored the only goal. It was one of the few highlights in a dull match, as was Arild Stavrum's goal - his 14th of the season - in Aberdeen's 1-0 win against Dunfermline. The Scottish FA are to reconsider their criteria for entry into their international football Hall of Fame. At present, players need to gain at least 50 caps to be included. However, one notable omission is that of Jim Baxter, who died last week and was only capped 34 times. It is not difficult to appreciate why the SFA are considering moving the goalposts. As Scotland's coach, Craig Brown, said: 'In the old days before substitutes, only 11 players would get a cap for a match and there were fewer matches. For example, I am allowed seven substitutes in next week's friendly ion Poland. That means that there could be as many as 18 caps awarded. In the old days, you probably would not get that many in a whole season.' But one player unlikely to take part in the Poland game is the Rangers captain, Barry Ferguson, who is poised to withdraw from the squad because of rib injury.",

Emile Heskey's shooting power? 'Whoof! Incredible.' And Gary McAllister, 36-year-old free transfer, one of the season's most astute signings, architect of the derby win at Goodison on Easter Monday and cool despatcher of Barcelona from the penalty spot four days later? Houllier's eyes briefly glance heavenwards. 'Macca,' he says, 'is a diamond.' </p> <p>Few could argue. There were one or two sniggers when supposedly ambitious Liverpool picked up the old man of the Coventry midfield last summer, but those doubters now look as foolish as the impatient Scotland supporters who brought McAllister's international career to a premature close. McAllister has featured in more games than even he would have imagined - towards the end of his second game in a week at Anfield he looked positively envious as young Gerrard was hauled off for a rest - and has brought intelligence, experience and composure to Liverpool's successful campaign on four fronts this season. </p> <p>It is unclear whether such a sizeable contribution was envisaged by Houllier at the start of the season, but it was obvious a few months ago that the manager knew he had landed on his feet. Raving about a typically committed Stuart Pearce performance for West Ham, Houllier expressed surprise and delight that the former England warhorse had just turned 38. 'That is fantastic!' Houllier exclaimed. 'It means if we are lucky we might get another two seasons out of Gary McAllister!' </p> <p>McAllister, though he really might be tired by then, would be the last to object. He recently admitted he had always harboured a secret desire to play for Liverpool, and to get the chance at such a late stage then score an injury-time winner in a derby at Goodison amounted to a dream come true. After that, merely popping in a penalty against Barcelona, enough to put his side in the Uefa Cup final in Dortmund against Alav\u00e9s on 16 May, was almost routine, or at least that's the way it looked as McAllister confidently stroked the ball home. 'I fancied myself to score all along, fancied it strongly,' he said. 'Barcelona rubbished us a bit, but over the two legs they didn't score and didn't get many chances.' </p> <p>Houllier is matter-of-fact about his reasons for bringing McAllister to Anfield. He was aware his team had subsided late last season through inexperience, and was keen to add a few older heads to his youthful mix to prevent Liverpool losing vital points through naivety. Markus Babbel fitted the bill perfectly, as did Nick Barmby, though Houllier specifically wanted a central midfielder as back-up for Gerrard, who would not be able to play in as many games as Liverpool would have liked. Houllier was delighted to find a player of McAllister's ability not only willing but available. </p> <p>'Macca is very useful because he's got good skill and a cool head,' Houllier said. 'He passes the ball well, doesn't panic or lose his composure, and his experience has come in very handy. That penalty against Barcelona was just what we signed him for, though initially I went for him because I knew Steven Gerrard would not be able to play in all the games. What I didn't know then was what a joy Gary would be to work with. He's still very fit, and his attitude has been superb. He knows he won't play in all the games either, but he doesn't moan and never sulks - he's a real team player.' </p> <p>As McAllister pointed out, you don't hold Barcelona to two clean sheets by playing as individuals. 'It was a big Liverpool team performance,' he said. Liverpool now need a few more of those in the league, as Leeds, Ipswich and even Chelsea are complicating the race for third position. Because of what happened last season, and because Leeds have done so much with the Champions League place Liverpool tossed so carelessly away, Houllier is haunted by the thought of missing out at the last again. Not even three cups on the sideboard would fully compensate for that eventuality. Houllier would not go as far as Robbie Fowler in suggesting failure to qualify for the Champions League would invalidate the whole season - showing a refreshing reluctance to abandon all dignity in the scramble for Uefa gold, he actually claimed Liverpool might be a little ahead of schedule at the moment - but his voice turned solemn and his expression hardened when he spoke of the absolute necessity of finishing in the top three. </p> <p>Although it has become the dreariest of clich\u00e9s, there is no doubt that when Houllier described today's game against Spurs as more important than the Uefa Cup semi-final, he meant it. Liverpool cannot keep watching other people play in Europe. 'The target all season has been to finish higher than we did last year, when we choked at the end,' he said. Houllier laughs at the suggestion Liverpool might be closing the gap on Manchester United - 'How can that be true when they are 20 points ahead of us?' - but is not unduly worried by talk of \u00a350million war chests for team-strengthening at Old Trafford for next season. 'We have to believe in ourselves, to expand and not to shrink,' he said. 'We are a young enough team to do that. I think we need strengthening in certain areas, but we don't need a revolution. Around 80 or 85 per cent of the team is there already, and we will get better as we mature.' </p> <p>Liverpool did the double over Manchester United this season, but keeping up with the big spenders from down the road is actually the least of Houllier's worries. Keeping up with Liverpool's own traditions, as relentlessly expounded by their legion of former players turned pundits, is far more taxing. 'Managing here is a bit different from managing anywhere else, even when I was manager of France I never felt under the microscope to such an extent,' he said. 'This club must hold the world record for providing pundits, they are on the radio, on the television and in the papers. There are about 20 of them and they all still live in the area. You could field a press team comprised solely of old Liverpool players. That is because of what happened in the past, which everybody knows about, and that is what we have to live up to. And of course we are not good enough, we can never be good enough. But if we can keep improving, which we are, at least we know we are headed in the right direction. </p> <p>'At this club there will always be the names from the past, but like I keep saying to the boys, it's down to us now to make a name for ourselves.'</p>",

'We are a lot stronger than last year,' McManaman says. 'We've proved that by doing well in both the league and in Europe. Overall, and especially at home, we are playing very good football and scoring lots and lots of goals.' And how.

All in all it's overwhelming. </p> <p>As far as McManaman is concerned, the manager has almost made life easy for himself. 'His secret is that he just lets the team get on with whatever they want to do.

The 29-year-old crafted two of Real's goals with delightfully executed assists. He also demonstrated some leadership skills, showing a mature head when the game degenerated into the unsavoury. </p> <p>It was a bizarre interlude.

Missiles rained down, Emre chucked some back, Okan collapsed on the turf, and all hell broke loose. Enter Macca and the peacemakers. He approached the fans and convinced them, in true scouse style, to calm down. 'It was a rough game, particularly in the second half when I think Galatasaray were fighting a lost cause really,' McManaman said.

      "body": "<p>One moment at Old Trafford last weekend encapsulated what having a centre-forward such as John Hartson has meant to Coventry. I am not referring to either of his two goals against Manchester United, but the reaction of United's Jaap Stam and Wes Brown - arguably the best pair of central defenders in the country - to one of the passes meant for Hartson inside their box. They were so anxious to stop him reaching it that both went for the ball (incidentally, all three players missed it). It is some time since Coventry had a big centre- forward in Hartson's opposition-worrying mould - the last was Dion Dublin, who was transferred to Aston Villa three years ago. </p> <p>The other indication of John's importance to Coventry, of course, can be found in his scoring record. Ten in 23 matches for Wimbledon this season was impressive enough, but in his nine matches for us, his goal average has been even better. This does not surprise me. I have always had a high regard for Hartson, yet a lot of people seem to have the impression that this was a panic buy. The fact is that we would have tried to sign him a lot earlier than we did, but the initial barrier was simply that we could not afford what Rangers and Tottenham had agreed to fork out for him - and what Wimbledon were expecting. </p> <p>More recently, the next obstacle concerned his old knee problems and the resulting difficulty in securing insurance. It is no secret that we have managed to find a way around that through a sort of hire-purchase deal in which his transfer fee will be paid in instalments linked to his first-team appearances. It is tempting to suggest that his form for us is based on his determination to prove a point to the bigger clubs who ultimately rejected him. There could be some truth in this, but the reality is that Hartson, despite being underrated at various times in his career, does not need to prove anything to anybody. One of the reasons why Hartson might have suffered in comparison with other centre-forwards is his body shape. He's a bit like Paul Gascoigne, in that he is never going to look like a Daley Thompson.</p> <p>When footballers of his build are playing well, people describe them as being strong and powerful; when they aren't, they are viewed as being fat. In John's case, his weight is something that I have not even thought about. I could not tell you what he weighs, or what his best weight is. All I know is that he is playing superbly. The other reason Hartson has tended to struggle to be recognised as a top-class striker is the perception of him as one of the game's most 'physical' players. His image - endorsed by his former West Ham manager Harry Redknapp's comment that he was like a Welsh rugby union front-row forward - is misleading. It says much about the general perception of him that, in his first couple of matches for Coventry, our players knocked so many speculative high balls in his direction that he must have had an aching neck. I had to tell them: 'John has not come here just to play like this. He can play football, too.' </p> <p>Since then they have discovered what I already knew: that Hartson is deceptively quick, has an excellent touch and, above all, has a football brain second to none. The best compliment I can pay him is to compare him to Norman Whiteside, my former Manchester United colleague and probably the best of all the big centre-forwards I worked with as a player. Like Hartson, Whiteside had tremendous vision. He was probably slightly the better of the two on the ground - and I stress the word slightly - while Hartson has the edge in the air and in his scoring record. As for his height and power, these are attributes that are as important now as they have always been.

      "bodyText": "One moment at Old Trafford last weekend encapsulated what having a centre-forward such as John Hartson has meant to Coventry. I am not referring to either of his two goals against Manchester United, but the reaction of United's Jaap Stam and Wes Brown - arguably the best pair of central defenders in the country - to one of the passes meant for Hartson inside their box. They were so anxious to stop him reaching it that both went for the ball (incidentally, all three players missed it). It is some time since Coventry had a big centre- forward in Hartson's opposition-worrying mould - the last was Dion Dublin, who was transferred to Aston Villa three years ago. The other indication of John's importance to Coventry, of course, can be found in his scoring record. Ten in 23 matches for Wimbledon this season was impressive enough, but in his nine matches for us, his goal average has been even better. This does not surprise me. I have always had a high regard for Hartson, yet a lot of people seem to have the impression that this was a panic buy. The fact is that we would have tried to sign him a lot earlier than we did, but the initial barrier was simply that we could not afford what Rangers and Tottenham had agreed to fork out for him - and what Wimbledon were expecting. More recently, the next obstacle concerned his old knee problems and the resulting difficulty in securing insurance. It is no secret that we have managed to find a way around that through a sort of hire-purchase deal in which his transfer fee will be paid in instalments linked to his first-team appearances. It is tempting to suggest that his form for us is based on his determination to prove a point to the bigger clubs who ultimately rejected him. There could be some truth in this, but the reality is that Hartson, despite being underrated at various times in his career, does not need to prove anything to anybody. One of the reasons why Hartson might have suffered in comparison with other centre-forwards is his body shape. He's a bit like Paul Gascoigne, in that he is never going to look like a Daley Thompson. When footballers of his build are playing well, people describe them as being strong and powerful; when they aren't, they are viewed as being fat. In John's case, his weight is something that I have not even thought about. I could not tell you what he weighs, or what his best weight is. All I know is that he is playing superbly. The other reason Hartson has tended to struggle to be recognised as a top-class striker is the perception of him as one of the game's most 'physical' players. His image - endorsed by his former West Ham manager Harry Redknapp's comment that he was like a Welsh rugby union front-row forward - is misleading. It says much about the general perception of him that, in his first couple of matches for Coventry, our players knocked so many speculative high balls in his direction that he must have had an aching neck. I had to tell them: 'John has not come here just to play like this. He can play football, too.' Since then they have discovered what I already knew: that Hartson is deceptively quick, has an excellent touch and, above all, has a football brain second to none. The best compliment I can pay him is to compare him to Norman Whiteside, my former Manchester United colleague and probably the best of all the big centre-forwards I worked with as a player. Like Hartson, Whiteside had tremendous vision. He was probably slightly the better of the two on the ground - and I stress the word slightly - while Hartson has the edge in the air and in his scoring record. As for his height and power, these are attributes that are as important now as they have always been. The view that the big, traditional-type British centre-forward has become outdated is difficult to sustain when you look at how Liverpool have benefited from the signing of Emile Heskey. In terms of players who can give teams a strong physical presence in opposing penalty boxes there were a couple of other notable examples in last week's European Champions League quarter-final ties. One was Valencia's Norwegian centre-forward, John Carew, who headed the goal that put Arsenal out of the competition; the other was Bayern Munich's Carsten Jancker, who could easily have scored one or two in the defeat of Manchester United. United might well have wished that they had greater height and power up front than that provided by Dwight Yorke and Andy Cole; a point brought into sharp focus by the fact that they looked at their most dangerous when Teddy Sheringham was on. No doubt, the need for a John Hartson type will not have been lost on Jaap Stam and Wes Brown.",

The title gave a deadly twist to a children's playground game and when, more than two decades later, he chose to make his hero a genuine clothier, he gave the novel a deceptively innocent title reminiscent of childhood and Beatrix Potter, The Tailor of Panama. </p> <p>One doubts if he was consciously thinking of Graham Greene's celebrated, semi-satirical essay on Potter's fiction in which he dismissed the eponymous hero of The Tailor of Gloucester as 'ineffective and too virtuous'. Without doubt, however, le Carr\u00e9 had Our Man in Havana in mind, as he says in his acknowledgements. </p> <p>Like Greene's novel, The Tailor of Panama is about a British expatriate in an unstable Latin American country put under pressure by British intelligence and inventing, with lethal consequences, a non-existent spy ring and a fictitious political conspiracy. Le Carr\u00e9's fine book is nearly twice the length of Greene's, denser and less funny, but the movie, of which he is co-scriptwriter with Andrew Davies and director John Boorman, is far superior to, and much tougher than, the film Greene made of Our Man in Havana with Carol Reed in 1960. </p> <p>Le Carr\u00e9's equivalents of Jim Wormold, the vacuum-cleaner salesman, and Hawthorne, the very establishment MI6 agent (the characters played by Alec Guinness and No\u00ebl Coward in Our Man in Havana) are Harry Pendel (so well played by Geoffrey Rush), the Panama City bespoke tailor, and Andy Osnard (Pierce Brosnan), the maverick MI6 operative who's been posted to the backwater of the Panama embassy as punishment for troublemaking. </p> <p>Although the comic intrigue in Greene's novel anticipated both the success of Castro's revolution (which followed the book's publication by a few months) and, quite uncannily, the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, Wormold and Hawthorne are figures from farce. Pendel and Osnard have a much greater weight and are altogether, on first acquaintance, less genial. </p> <p>Both men are frauds and self-deceivers, but their fraudulence and self-deception have a larger political dimension, as we appreciate during the witty courtship between tailor and spy with which the film opens. Pendel, the working-class Londoner who learnt his tailoring in jail, poses as an established Savile Row master and dispenses old- world class to the unscrupulous rich and nouveaux riches of Panama. The spirit of Benny, his late Jewish uncle (an amusing turn by Harold Pinter), hovers over his shoulder giving dubious advice, but Pendel really believes in the snobbish standards and outmoded Englishness that he has espoused. </p> <p>Osnard, who has seen through Pendel's fa\u00e7ade, works for an organisation that, in the post-imperial, post-Cold War world, has become largely redundant. He pretends that Britain has a major role in the world, if one dependent for intelligence operations on US subventions, but his growing cynicism has turned him into an opportunist. When he seduces Pendel - with money and blackmail - into becoming an agent, he wants to believe in 'the silent opposition' of local liberals that the tailor invents, and in a non-existent clandestine scheme to sell the Panama Canal to a Chinese, French and Japanese consortium. </p> <p>The difference between the two is that Pendel is essentially a decent man, real concern underlying his subservience, while Osnard exists in a moral vacuum. The truly good person, however, is Pendel's American wife, Louisa (Jamie Lee Curtis), a representative of the reality principle. She respects the recently appointed Panamanian executives of the canal company for which she works, and stands in sharp contrast to her half-demented fellow-countrymen plotting against them in the Pentagon. </p> <p>The film is given a firm sense of reality through the confident handling of authentic locations by Boorman, who has worked in Latin America before in The Emerald Forest and, more recently, in a politically volatile state in Beyond Rangoon. There is no excessive use of local colour and the background is integrated into the dramatic action. Boorman directs with a light touch of a sort that was only to be seen intermittently in his work before his last movie, The General , about the Irish gangster, Martin Cahill. Brendan Gleeson, so superb as Cahill, here immerses himself in the role of a burnt-out ex-revolutionary who becomes Pendel's chief fall guy. </p> <p>The cleverest trick, which adds to the humour and excitement, as well as underlining the film's meaning, is the casting of Pierce Brosnan, who's never been so good. When he is briefed at MI6's Thamesside HQ by a bland superior, his eyes twinkle evilly at the prospect of easy pickings in corrupt Panama, and we realise that this is a different organisation from that last bastion of patriotism served by James Bond. There have been supposed anti-Bonds on the screen before, but here we have the most confident embodiment of Bond since Connery's day serving himself rather than Her Majesty. </p> <p>Osnard is suave in the manner of a student of Playboy ; his only piece of advanced technology is a Zippo containing a miniature camera; as a lover, he's violent, sweaty and not irresistible, and his word is not his bond. Just before Osnard arrives at the tailoring shop, Pendel is assuring a corpulent client that the suit he's fitting is the sort Mr Connery wears and that he has the same 'golfer's shoulders'.</p>",

So it's pleasing to welcome writer-director Rod Lurie's <strong> The Contender</strong>, a fairly serious movie dealing with the actual process of politics. </p> <p>His Vice-President having recently died, Democrat President Jackson Evans (Jeff Bridges), a confident, manipulative Clinton type (but personally uncompromised and seemingly without a wife), nominates Senator Laine Hanson (Joan Allen) as the first female Veep to end his second term with a flourish. He is vociferously opposed by wily right-wing Republican Representative Shelley Runyon (Gary Oldman), chairman of the Congressional committee that will advise and consent in the appointment. Runyon hates Hanson because she's a political turncoat; his preferred candidate is Governor Hathaway of Virginia (William Peterson), a moderate Southern Democrat. So battle commences with wheeling, dealing, mudslinging and FBI investigations. The biggest threat to the confirmation turns out to be the accusation that as a university student Hanson took part in a sex orgy, a matter on which she refuses to comment, believing her private life irrelevant. In fact, the double standard is alive and well in Washington. </p> <p>The movie is entertaining, plausible, and often very funny, with an outstanding performance from Oldman as a seemingly honest, sincere reactionary. But in the final half-hour or so, the film changes character and direction, losing all sense of balance. A skeleton the size of a dinosaur is dragged from the cupboard of a major character; Senator Hanson states her liberal credo before the committee with accompanying emotional music; and the President makes an impassioned Capraesque address to a joint session of Congress that publicly humiliates his chief opponent and is accompanied by triumphalist chords which threaten to modulate into the 'Ode to Joy'. </p> <p>Apart from being dramatically phoney and unconvincing, the film ends up misrepresenting the political process, and concludes with the sanctimonious dedication 'For our Daughters'. The Contender is in every way inferior as a piece of filmmaking and as a guide to life in the Capitol to Otto Preminger's 1962 classic, Advise and Consent, which was also a study of a controversial presidential nomination. </p> <p><strong> Boesman and Lena</strong> is about the effects of politics rather than the business of politics - doubly so, in fact. Athol Fugard wrote this, his most Beckettian play in 1969, and his controlled, impassioned assault on apartheid centres on two dispossessed Cape Coloureds, the resilient Lena (Angela Bassett) and her brutalised partner, Boesman (Danny Glover), who drift around the bleak countryside like Vladimir and Estragon. Shot on location in South Africa, the film was directed by the late John Berry, who as a victim of McCarthyism (he was black-listed in 1951 and went into French exile just as his Hollywood career was taking off) was well acquainted with political persecution. I'm not at all sure about his decision to use brief flashbacks showing the characters' earlier lives (including the birth of a short-lived child, a happy township dance, the destruction of their last shantytown hovel), but this is a moving version of an important play. </p> <p>Writer-director Karyn Kusama's directorial debut <strong> Girlfight</strong> has elements of every boxing film you ever saw including the Hispanic protagonist's desire to get out of the ghetto via the square ring, the artistic brother who needs help, the weak, unsupportive father, the lover who worries about possible injuries. The difference here is that the protagonist is female, the angry high-school senior Diana Guzman (Michelle Rodriguez) from a Brooklyn project who dons boxing gloves to channel her formidable aggression. However, her boyfriend is also a featherweight contender and due to a new policy of gender-blind matching in New York amateur boxing, the two come up against each other in a climactic bout. This is an engaging, warm-hearted film with a fetching heroine, and with the worst injuries a black eye and a couple of bruises, it's the least violent boxing movie I've seen, and that includes Keaton's Battling Butler and Chaplin's The Champion. </p> <p>Yet another directorial debut, <strong> One Night at McCool's</strong>, a very American black comedy, is the work of a Dutch filmmaker Harald Zwart, who began his career in Norway, and the script is by Stan Seidel, an experienced TV writer who died last year before the film was completed. In three complementary overlapping series of flashbacks, na\u00efve bartender Matt Dillon, preening lawyer Paul Reisner and widowed cop John Goodman recall their amorous adventures with the extravagant, homicidal beauty Jewel (Liv Tyler) in a dreary suburb of St. Louis, Missouri. Cleverly, each tells his story to a different listener. The lawyer is on the couch of a highly sceptical female analyst. The cop is making an informal confession to a fascinated priest (Richard Jenkins) who pours them a couple of preparatory whiskies, himself using a communion chalice at the bottom of which he discovers a booze-soaked wafer. The bartender spills his beans to a louche hitman he's hiring to kill Tyler. </p> <p>The film's climax is casually, lethally violent and there are five deaths in the movie, including a pair of slimy lawyers and - as a radio newscaster says in announcing one of the deaths - 'at least it was a lawyer, not a doctor'. </p> <p>The film packs an enormous amount of plot into its 92 minutes, but what keeps one watching, apart from the comic detail, is the exuberance of the performances. Liv Tyler relishes the role of Jewel, the ruthless, three-faced accomplice to a criminal low-life, and Michael Douglas, the film's co-producer, has never played anyone as cheesy as the itinerant assassin who chooses a bingo hall for his rendezvous with the bartender. Douglas has an appalling wig with a surf-like quiff resembling that of Johnny Cash, whose 'Wanted Man' is playing in the background when we first see him. </p> <p>Performance is also what counts in Fran\u00e7ois Ozon's low-voltage <strong> Under the Sand</strong>, in this case the formidable presence of the handsome 56-year-old Charlotte Rampling as a British widow trying to come to terms with the death of her French husband (Bruno Cremer) after 25 years of marriage. She's a gifted university teacher, though the only time we see her at work she reads a long passage of The Waves to her pupils in English, then ends the class 10 minutes early because she's having an emotional crisis. She communes at length with the very substantial ghost of her late husband, which is rather trying, and has an affair with a pompous publisher, whom she clearly dislikes. Still, Rampling claims our interest and makes a thinly written character compelling. </p> <p>Nick Hamm's thriller <strong> The Hole</strong>, opens intriguingly as the dishevelled, blood-stained Liz (Thora Birch) staggers into her expensive co-educational public school in the English countryside to explain how she came to survive an ordeal in which she and three fellow six-formers were trapped for 10 days inside an abandoned civil defence bunker in the woods. Contradictory stories follow as the police and a forensic shrink (Embeth Davidz) investigate. </p> <p>The horrors of public school life are well attended to, but through a confused narrative and tedious characters, it's the film itself that ends up in a bunker with the director desperate trying to chip it up on to the green.</p>",

The Contender is in every way inferior as a piece of filmmaking and as a guide to life in the Capitol to Otto Preminger's 1962 classic, Advise and Consent, which was also a study of a controversial presidential nomination. Boesman and Lena is about the effects of politics rather than the business of politics - doubly so, in fact. Athol Fugard wrote this, his most Beckettian play in 1969, and his controlled, impassioned assault on apartheid centres on two dispossessed Cape Coloureds, the resilient Lena (Angela Bassett) and her brutalised partner, Boesman (Danny Glover), who drift around the bleak countryside like Vladimir and Estragon. Shot on location in South Africa, the film was directed by the late John Berry, who as a victim of McCarthyism (he was black-listed in 1951 and went into French exile just as his Hollywood career was taking off) was well acquainted with political persecution. I'm not at all sure about his decision to use brief flashbacks showing the characters' earlier lives (including the birth of a short-lived child, a happy township dance, the destruction of their last shantytown hovel), but this is a moving version of an important play. Writer-director Karyn Kusama's directorial debut Girlfight has elements of every boxing film you ever saw including the Hispanic protagonist's desire to get out of the ghetto via the square ring, the artistic brother who needs help, the weak, unsupportive father, the lover who worries about possible injuries. The difference here is that the protagonist is female, the angry high-school senior Diana Guzman (Michelle Rodriguez) from a Brooklyn project who dons boxing gloves to channel her formidable aggression. However, her boyfriend is also a featherweight contender and due to a new policy of gender-blind matching in New York amateur boxing, the two come up against each other in a climactic bout. This is an engaging, warm-hearted film with a fetching heroine, and with the worst injuries a black eye and a couple of bruises, it's the least violent boxing movie I've seen, and that includes Keaton's Battling Butler and Chaplin's The Champion. Yet another directorial debut, One Night at McCool's, a very American black comedy, is the work of a Dutch filmmaker Harald Zwart, who began his career in Norway, and the script is by Stan Seidel, an experienced TV writer who died last year before the film was completed. In three complementary overlapping series of flashbacks, na\u00efve bartender Matt Dillon, preening lawyer Paul Reisner and widowed cop John Goodman recall their amorous adventures with the extravagant, homicidal beauty Jewel (Liv Tyler) in a dreary suburb of St. Louis, Missouri. Cleverly, each tells his story to a different listener. The lawyer is on the couch of a highly sceptical female analyst. The cop is making an informal confession to a fascinated priest (Richard Jenkins) who pours them a couple of preparatory whiskies, himself using a communion chalice at the bottom of which he discovers a booze-soaked wafer. The bartender spills his beans to a louche hitman he's hiring to kill Tyler. The film's climax is casually, lethally violent and there are five deaths in the movie, including a pair of slimy lawyers and - as a radio newscaster says in announcing one of the deaths - 'at least it was a lawyer, not a doctor'. The film packs an enormous amount of plot into its 92 minutes, but what keeps one watching, apart from the comic detail, is the exuberance of the performances. Liv Tyler relishes the role of Jewel, the ruthless, three-faced accomplice to a criminal low-life, and Michael Douglas, the film's co-producer, has never played anyone as cheesy as the itinerant assassin who chooses a bingo hall for his rendezvous with the bartender. Douglas has an appalling wig with a surf-like quiff resembling that of Johnny Cash, whose 'Wanted Man' is playing in the background when we first see him. Performance is also what counts in Fran\u00e7ois Ozon's low-voltage Under the Sand, in this case the formidable presence of the handsome 56-year-old Charlotte Rampling as a British widow trying to come to terms with the death of her French husband (Bruno Cremer) after 25 years of marriage. She's a gifted university teacher, though the only time we see her at work she reads a long passage of The Waves to her pupils in English, then ends the class 10 minutes early because she's having an emotional crisis. She communes at length with the very substantial ghost of her late husband, which is rather trying, and has an affair with a pompous publisher, whom she clearly dislikes. Still, Rampling claims our interest and makes a thinly written character compelling. Nick Hamm's thriller The Hole, opens intriguingly as the dishevelled, blood-stained Liz (Thora Birch) staggers into her expensive co-educational public school in the English countryside to explain how she came to survive an ordeal in which she and three fellow six-formers were trapped for 10 days inside an abandoned civil defence bunker in the woods. Contradictory stories follow as the police and a forensic shrink (Embeth Davidz) investigate. The horrors of public school life are well attended to, but through a confused narrative and tedious characters, it's the film itself that ends up in a bunker with the director desperate trying to chip it up on to the green.",

So it was fitting that the Bayern Munich coach last week invoked the writer in pithy response to criticism that he was in charge of a retirement home for past-it footballers. </p> <p>He could afford to. His alleged geriatrics had just beaten the starlets of Manchester United to advance to the semi-finals of the Champions League. Some trees. And standing like an oak in the middle of the Olympiapark on Wednesday night was Hitzfeld's most durable piece of lumber, the 31-year-old Stefan Effenberg. </p> <p>Hitzfeld's record in Europe, on modest resources, bears comparison with any of his contemporaries, and Effenberg's economy of movement in Bayern's 2-1 win matched the prudence of his manager in the marketplace. So loud off the pitch and calm upon it, the archetypal stroller barely broke sweat and only occasionally left his vantage point in the centre circle as his team protected their 3-1 aggregate lead in the latter stages of an often chaotic second half. He directed traffic and pickpocketed possession when required. It was sublime, artful larceny. </p> <p>Effenberg would do for Hitzfeld. As would the men who scored the killer goals in the first half, the 30-year-old Mehmet Scholl and Giovane Elber, 28, each of them grateful for the industry on the left-hand side of midfield of the 31-year-old Michael Tarnat. In goal, Oliver Kahn's reflexes were in better shape than any 31-year-old has a right to expect, and everywhere on the park Bayern conveyed a mood of maturity and steel. They played with purpose - as well as total belief that their European experience would prevail. </p> <p>When Effenberg declared beforehand that: 'In 90 minutes, 120 minutes, it doesn't matter... we will definitely win,' he defined the tone of the encounter. There was no ambiguity in the nature of his challenge. Bayern's ebullience was palpable. </p> <p>No such vibe of bravado emanated from United. All week Alex Ferguson had been keen to underline that his players needed to show resolve, a call to arms that might seem redundant in the context of such a big occasion. It was as if he sensed a lingering fragility after a mixed campaign in Europe, and he was reminding his well-paid lovelies that they had better buck up their ideas. </p> <p>Dwight Yorke and Andy Cole regularly bear the brunt of these coded references - they toiled with vigour, if vainly, on Wednesday, incidentally - but it was David Beckham who, inevitably, was the focus of the speculation. That Beckham was suspended hardly mattered. For a week or more the rumours had bounced around the prints that Ferguson had tired of his superstar's inconsistency and, in the absence of any overnight generosity from the bottom-liners at Old Trafford, was prepared to trade him for Rivaldo. He might even break up the team altogether. </p> <p>Seasoned United watchers theorised long into the night on Wednesday that Ferguson was playing a smart endgame, that he was trying to persuade the board to spend serious money by threatening to start the United revolution all over again - a move that would have an immediate impact on share prices and the club's commercial side. </p> <p>And now he is to sign Ruud van Nistelrooy, it seems, for \u00a318million, half a million less than the sum agreed with PSV a year ago, when the Dutchman broke down with a knee ligament injury that put him out for 10 months. Not exactly Rivaldo, but not bad. The assistant manager, Steve McLaren, hints there could be more big names on the way, 'a player like Cantona', to inspire and entertain. </p> <p>But talk of letting Beckham go, for the moment, is no more than that. Some think it mischievous, or simply indulgent. Eric Harrison, who knows Beckham as well as anyone in football, says it would be 'a backward step' to sell him. Or any of their core stars, for that matter. Harrison, Mark Hughes's assistant with Wales, coached Beckham as a teenager in United's youth team, alongside Ryan Giggs, the Neville brothers, Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt, and says their closeness and understanding is the key to United's success. </p> <p>'We were very fortunate in that they all came together at the same time and they all helped each other along. They were pals, good pals. And they were determined as a group that they were going to progress together. I'm totally convinced about that. And they have stuck together. I've always said it would be a sad day if one of them split, or if they left for one reason or another, a very sad day for the club.' </p> <p>What clouds the picture is the curious outburst by the captain in defeat. While the manager was his measured, Scottish self in flat-batting inquiries about new players, Roy Keane charged in with both feet. His assertion that this team might have 'reached the end of the road' and, plainly 'are not good enough', was not merely a rude dismissal of his team-mates. He could have been echoing the sentiments of Ferguson, whose relationship with the board demands more circumspection. Ferguson's admiration of Keane - in this match and generally, as he showed by not criticising his captain after yesterday's sending off - is such that it is inconceivable they have not discussed the rebuilding of a team that, for all its quality, does look in need of peppering up. </p> <p>Full-scale dismantling, though, would be an over-reaction. And who was Keane thinking of? Surely not Sheringham, 35, the footballer of the year, whom Ferguson has just offered a one-year contract. Or Giggs, who's signed up for five more years, Scholes, the improving Butt, Stam, young Brown, younger Chadwick. Keane himself. One suspects Yorke will be the only sacrifice. </p> <p>All Ferguson would say was that Real Madrid, Bayern's semi-final opponents, were 'without a doubt' the best team in Europe, particularly so since the purchase of Luis Figo. If that is not an unsubtle hint for more cash, City are the best team in Manchester. </p> <p>Ferguson is in charge of the richest club in the world - or so we are continually reminded. His task in his farewell season must be to break open the United bank. He's made a decent start. </p> <p>This month the club revealed extraordinary half-year profits, far removed from the finances of their domestic rivals. In the six months to 31 January, United's turnover was more than \u00a372 million, up 13 per cent; their pre-tax profit was \u00a317.3m, up 42 per cent. Unlike at clubs more reliant on television revenue, the fans have contributed hugely at the turnstiles. Since the seating was expanded from 55,300 to 67,700, gate receipts have risen from \u00a321.4m to \u00a328.4m. </p> <p>That constitutes considerable terrace pressure for regular success. </p> <p>United also sealed their partnership with the New York Yankees, as well as agreements with Vodafone and platinum sponsors, worth \u00a311.1m. Then they signed a \u00a3303m deal with Nike for 13 years. If they can tiptoe through the football club's rickety wage structure, the money is obviously there to buy players. </p> <p>What the club also will need in a year's time is a new manager. Of all the speculation swirling about last week, the suggestion that Hitzfeld might replace Ferguson was the most intriguing. And, apparently, the most misguided. </p> <p>'The fact that my name has been mentioned honours me,' Hitzfeld told Sport Bild , 'but I'm fulfilling my contract here.' </p> <p>Hitzfeld is an unusual man. His contract runs until 2004 and his commitment is to Germany as much as to Bayern. The Bavarians are Germany's champion, in the old-fashioned sense of the word - and it would be hard to say the same for United, so deep and idiotic is the jealousy they inspire in the country at large. </p> <p>'The fact that Bayern is the main representative of German football means that one has to identify with the German mentality,' he said. 'First Germany, then Europe and only then South America.' </p> <p>But then, on Friday, a lumberjack entered the Bavarian forest. Bayern's vice-president, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, announced that the club were seeking an equity partner to raise \u00a380million for a raid on the world's best footballing talent. The old trees were looking vulnerable. 'I believe that we will see European player earnings reach the levels comparable to US sportsmen,' Rummenigge said. </p> <p>Goodbye Manchester United, they sang on Wednesday night.

      "body": "<p><strong>Faking It</strong> C4<br> <strong>The Whistleblower </strong>BBC1<br><strong>Your Money or Your Life</strong> BBC2<br><strong>This Is Your Life</strong> BBC1 </p> <p>Sian Evans, the star of Channel 4's riveting <strong>Faking It</strong>, was an improbably sweet, demure 22-year-old classical cellist apparently hired straight from docusoap's central casting: 'Hey, get me a girl with no life but a very big instrument, potentially-pretty-but-deeply-dowdy - glasses, shapeless sweaters, hair scraped back! Y'know - the kinda girl who thinks hard house is chamber music with the volume turned up to 11...' </p> <p>In TV terms, the delightful Sian was quite obviously a freak, a rare young female of the species for whom Top of the Pops might refer to the first violin in a Boston orchestra. These days, it is no mean feat to be quite so heroically individualistic in a world where every tweenager knows the difference between trance and techno. </p> <p>Sian's challenge was to take her cello and baggy sweaters to London, where Anne Savage, 'the queen of hard house', would teach her to pass herself off as a club DJ. The baffled, bedazzled outsider ('They're very glamorous,' she said of her mentors, Anne, and fellow DJ, Lottie. 'I did feel intimidated') was immediately hauled off to some West End Club Tropicana where, as a friend of Anne's, the drinks were definitely free and she was taken under the wing of a befeathered transsexual. </p> <p>Later, as she admitted that 'the music's going to take me a while to like, let alone love', there were mixing lessons on Anne's decks, voice coaching to assist Sian in a necessarily attitudinal method of shouting (the rain in Ibiza falls mainly on the...?), some trendy shopping and groovy primping (tears of joy and a hug for the stylist: 'Oh my God! I can't believe my hair can look like this!') and dancing lessons to give her sheepish shuffle a little Spanish hustle. </p> <p>There were moments when it all went a bit Pete Tong ('Wrong!' said Sian, chuffed at sussing the lingo), at the party, for example, where Sian tested her skills DJing for some of Anne's cooler-than-thou friends. A Big Boo to the arrogant male guest who made Sian cry by criticising her mixing technique before heading for the door with a shrug - but at least the girls all rallied round for a hug. </p> <p>Of course, in the end, Sian didn't just pull it off, she triumphed. After playing her set alongside three young female DJs and bullshitting her way through an interview, not one of the (male) professionals picked this confident, knowledgeable, stylish young woman as an imposter in the land of impenetrable hipness, mostly because, as Sian herself observed: 'It's just attitude.' </p> <p>All-areas access to the cult of coolness is very easily obtained by dressing up your talent in the right trousers and having some influential friends, as one of the judges unwittingly revealed on discovering that Sian had spent just a month in immersion therapy, very convincingly learning his trade: 'It puts me to shame!' I doubt if Sian, surely the only cellist in the Ulster Orchestra who is saving up for her own decks, will ever wear a baggy jumper again. </p> <p>When it was all over, Anne, Lottie, voice coach Jill ('It was a privilege to watch someone blossom') and Sian all cried, while I snivelled a bit and belatedly realised, with a jolt, that this wouldn't have been half the programme it was - and it was a corker- if the protagonists had all been men. Far from resenting the fact that Sian had super-swiftly faked her way into their world, both Anne and Lottie were fit to burst with maternal pride, which was lovely to watch because, alongside the ability to wear purple nail-varnish and slutty heels, it is the sweet generosity of bonded sisterhood that is one of the very best things about being a girl - and you don't often see it on TV. </p> <p>In the two-part Easter thriller, <strong>The Whistleblower</strong>, Amanda Burton faked it as a blonde but she still didn't have much fun. Well, she wouldn't, would she, for fun and Amanda Burton segue about as successfully as a Hear'Say track and a slab of hard house. Still, it was an oddly gripping, if monumentally implausible (and eventually downright silly) drama in which Burton played Laura, the lowlyish employee of a merchant bank who uncovered the laundering of \u00a3352 million of South American drug money by her bosses and decided to share this information with the National Criminal Intelligence Service. In short, it was Squealing Witness. </p> <p>With their lives under threat, Laura and her family dodged murderous Mexicans, bullets and speeding trucks and were rushed into the world's most ineffective witness protection programme. You knew it was all going to go a bit Pete Tong when Burton rejected re-location to Australia (presumably on the grounds of BBC budgetary constraints) with a firm: 'No, we're staying in England!' </p> <p>Immediately, her husband (Neil Pearson) logged on and started sending emails, the stroppy teenage daughter began ringing her boyfriend from every phone in sight and Laura went off to visit her mother in hospital (Virginia McKenna, with Alzheimer's and about three lines). </p> <p>I waited - not long, as it turned out - for a scene in which Burton would revisit one of my favourite Sam Ryan moments - a pensive, lip-biting, close-up, preferably in a car. And, lo, it turns out that she can do humourless, secretive and pensively lip-biting as a blonde just as well as she can do it as a brunette. Eventually, after a couple of bloodbaths and a cat's cradle of confusing plot twists, Laura finally ended up as a very silent witness indeed, comatose, but with her roots still in excellent condition.

      "bodyText": "Faking It C4 The Whistleblower BBC1 Your Money or Your Life BBC2 This Is Your Life BBC1 Sian Evans, the star of Channel 4's riveting Faking It, was an improbably sweet, demure 22-year-old classical cellist apparently hired straight from docusoap's central casting: 'Hey, get me a girl with no life but a very big instrument, potentially-pretty-but-deeply-dowdy - glasses, shapeless sweaters, hair scraped back! Y'know - the kinda girl who thinks hard house is chamber music with the volume turned up to 11...' In TV terms, the delightful Sian was quite obviously a freak, a rare young female of the species for whom Top of the Pops might refer to the first violin in a Boston orchestra. These days, it is no mean feat to be quite so heroically individualistic in a world where every tweenager knows the difference between trance and techno. Sian's challenge was to take her cello and baggy sweaters to London, where Anne Savage, 'the queen of hard house', would teach her to pass herself off as a club DJ. The baffled, bedazzled outsider ('They're very glamorous,' she said of her mentors, Anne, and fellow DJ, Lottie. 'I did feel intimidated') was immediately hauled off to some West End Club Tropicana where, as a friend of Anne's, the drinks were definitely free and she was taken under the wing of a befeathered transsexual. Later, as she admitted that 'the music's going to take me a while to like, let alone love', there were mixing lessons on Anne's decks, voice coaching to assist Sian in a necessarily attitudinal method of shouting (the rain in Ibiza falls mainly on the...?), some trendy shopping and groovy primping (tears of joy and a hug for the stylist: 'Oh my God! I can't believe my hair can look like this!') and dancing lessons to give her sheepish shuffle a little Spanish hustle. There were moments when it all went a bit Pete Tong ('Wrong!' said Sian, chuffed at sussing the lingo), at the party, for example, where Sian tested her skills DJing for some of Anne's cooler-than-thou friends. A Big Boo to the arrogant male guest who made Sian cry by criticising her mixing technique before heading for the door with a shrug - but at least the girls all rallied round for a hug. Of course, in the end, Sian didn't just pull it off, she triumphed. After playing her set alongside three young female DJs and bullshitting her way through an interview, not one of the (male) professionals picked this confident, knowledgeable, stylish young woman as an imposter in the land of impenetrable hipness, mostly because, as Sian herself observed: 'It's just attitude.' All-areas access to the cult of coolness is very easily obtained by dressing up your talent in the right trousers and having some influential friends, as one of the judges unwittingly revealed on discovering that Sian had spent just a month in immersion therapy, very convincingly learning his trade: 'It puts me to shame!' I doubt if Sian, surely the only cellist in the Ulster Orchestra who is saving up for her own decks, will ever wear a baggy jumper again. When it was all over, Anne, Lottie, voice coach Jill ('It was a privilege to watch someone blossom') and Sian all cried, while I snivelled a bit and belatedly realised, with a jolt, that this wouldn't have been half the programme it was - and it was a corker- if the protagonists had all been men. Far from resenting the fact that Sian had super-swiftly faked her way into their world, both Anne and Lottie were fit to burst with maternal pride, which was lovely to watch because, alongside the ability to wear purple nail-varnish and slutty heels, it is the sweet generosity of bonded sisterhood that is one of the very best things about being a girl - and you don't often see it on TV. In the two-part Easter thriller, The Whistleblower, Amanda Burton faked it as a blonde but she still didn't have much fun. Well, she wouldn't, would she, for fun and Amanda Burton segue about as successfully as a Hear'Say track and a slab of hard house. Still, it was an oddly gripping, if monumentally implausible (and eventually downright silly) drama in which Burton played Laura, the lowlyish employee of a merchant bank who uncovered the laundering of \u00a3352 million of South American drug money by her bosses and decided to share this information with the National Criminal Intelligence Service. In short, it was Squealing Witness. With their lives under threat, Laura and her family dodged murderous Mexicans, bullets and speeding trucks and were rushed into the world's most ineffective witness protection programme. You knew it was all going to go a bit Pete Tong when Burton rejected re-location to Australia (presumably on the grounds of BBC budgetary constraints) with a firm: 'No, we're staying in England!' Immediately, her husband (Neil Pearson) logged on and started sending emails, the stroppy teenage daughter began ringing her boyfriend from every phone in sight and Laura went off to visit her mother in hospital (Virginia McKenna, with Alzheimer's and about three lines). I waited - not long, as it turned out - for a scene in which Burton would revisit one of my favourite Sam Ryan moments - a pensive, lip-biting, close-up, preferably in a car. And, lo, it turns out that she can do humourless, secretive and pensively lip-biting as a blonde just as well as she can do it as a brunette. Eventually, after a couple of bloodbaths and a cat's cradle of confusing plot twists, Laura finally ended up as a very silent witness indeed, comatose, but with her roots still in excellent condition. Presumably, just as elaborate reconstructive surgery is offered to US Mafia dons, a full head of highlights is a compensatory perk for those in the British witness protection programme. Not quite enough to tempt you to blow the whistle, though, is it? In the first of the new series of Your Money or Your Life, US fiscal guru Alvin Hall attempted to give recently separated mother-of-two Wendy a financial makeover. Ostensibly living in the twenty-first century, poor Wendy clearly still believed in fairies and had marooned herself on a fantasy island populated by cloud cuckoos and situated in the middle of a large Egyptian river - yes, she was in denial.

Get a grip, woman! I was torn between empathy (I, too, quite desperately, perhaps irrationally, wanted to keep my home when my husband left) and anger (how can any modern thirtysomething woman be so pathetically disabled about opening a bill, for chrissakes, much less reveal herself to be such a smug Hyacinth Bucket: 'I'm quite materialistic.

      "body": "<p><strong> 'It was as if I had failed somehow.' </strong><br><strong>'I didn't think it was wrong, but I wish, I really wish, it hadn't happened.' </strong><br><strong>'I thought: how could I let this happen to me; this kind of thing happens to other people.'</strong><br><strong>'People think you're careless, irresponsible, immoral - not like them.' </strong><br><strong>'I couldn't talk.' </strong><br><strong>'It was a secret.'</strong> </p> <p>In this country between 30 and 40 per cent of women have an abortion; one in three. Two hundred thousand women every year have a pregnancy terminated. They are in their teens, their twenties, their thirties, their forties; they are single women and married ones; childless or with a family. </p> <p>It is a common experience, although we don't talk of it as common or normal - in fact, we usually don't talk about it at all. It has been legal for over 30 years, and only eight per cent of the population think that it should not be. These eight per cent are outside of the pragmatic argument about time limits and doctors' rights not to perform terminations - for them, all abortion is wrong, a form of murder incomprehensibly legitimised by society. </p> <p>The fact is, abortion has gradually but steadily increased over the last decade, and in spite of protests by the anti-abortion lobby there is no sign that we will ever return to the back-street days. Abortion, like contraception, is part of the fabric of modern society; the means by which contemporary women take control of their fertility and their lives. Perhaps it is time, finally, to think of it in the same way that we think of contraception: as a necessary and helpful intervention, as a way of making women equal, as a positive sign that women are taking control of their lives. Abortion is the way we live now. </p> <p>Yet we continue to argue about abortion, hold passionate moral opinions, worry over the rights and wrongs of it. And this perpetual, unresolved anxiety is actually reflected in the law, for in this country each woman who chooses a termination must, in a sense, argue her case, and persuade two doctors to ratify her decision. While, in the last 30 years, abortions have increased and become, bit by bit, more publicly acceptable, the language with which we talk about them has remained stubbornly the same. Rather than speaking of the 'foetus' we talk about the 'unborn child', a phrase coined by anti-abortion-groups. This phrase, along with the posters like that of a tender, curled foetus held in the palm of a hand, implicitly brands all women who have an abortion as murderers. We use an emotional and judgmental vocabulary of shame and guilt, directed almost exclusively at the woman. To have an abortion is 'the lesser of two evils'; a woman has been 'careless' or 'irresponsible' or 'selfish'; she should have known better; she shouldn't have got carried away; this will be a lesson. </p> <p>Good women don't have abortions. Bad girls do. And there is a sense that these bad girls - feckless girls who've had too much sex, with too little care - should suffer for their mistakes. Abortions shouldn't be too easy. </p> <p>In the United States the rhetoric is far more extreme and the direct action more violent. Three weeks ago anti-abortionists won the right to publish on the internet what amounts to a hit-list of doctors who provide terminations for pregnant women. The site is known as the 'Nuremberg Files' (because, for the anti-abortionists, abortion amounts to a Holocaust of unborn babies); abortions are called 'Satan's food source'. The doctors are 'baby butchers'. Those performing terminations are not just the target of this wrenched, pornographic language but of death threats and physical abuse. Seven have been murdered in the past 10 years. </p> <p>If David Paintin had lived in the United States, he too would presumably be named butcher and murderer, and his name posted on the site. He is the Emeritus Reader of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at St Mary's, London, a courteous, grey-haired man who for 27 years - until his retirement from the front line in 1990 - performed hundreds, thousands, of terminations. Now he lives in a lovely house in the countryside, reads books about shipbuilding, tends his pretty garden - and remains tirelessly active in the abortion reform campaign and radical in his unblinking commitment to the rights of women to choose. </p> <p>Paintin's father was a Methodist minister, and he himself used to be a religious man. Now he calls himself an 'almost atheist' and a humanist. In 1956, when he was just starting out as a young and idealistic doctor, he worked with Dougal Baird in Aberdeen, where abortion was only a civil offence. Here they came across the poor and exhausted wives of fishermen, who had more children that they could cope with and who were often at breaking point. 'The women needed abortions,' says Paintin. 'Doctors could do them more safely. It was a utilitarian kind of ethics - no firm, fixed rules, but a practical approach.' He has provided women with terminations ever since. Most of them were early ones (a good 80 per cent of abortions are pre-12 weeks gestation). Some were later. Only a small fraction of one per cent take place after 24 weeks - because a woman had thought she was menopausal, infertile, because she is scared, in denial, in ignorance and terror and swamping panic. 'But yes, I would do those too if a woman requested it and persuaded me that she was justified in her request.' </p> <p>When I wince at the thought of an abortion this late on, he says firmly: 'In my opinion a foetus is not a person in the way a woman is. Personhood is conferred by the woman giving birth. It is an act. It has no ethical status until it is independent and breathing air.' He smiles dryly, and adds: 'I am well aware that this is a position that some people feel very uncomfortable with.' </p> <p>I ask him to describe methods of termination, and he does so carefully and unemotionally. There are two basic ways of having an abortion. The first is with drugs, so that labour is induced - an experience much closer, clearly, to giving birth to a baby, and which some women choose precisely in order to participate in the process and to feel a kind of bereavement and closure at the end of it; some even hold the foetus before relinquishing it. The other method is suction. The foetus is pulled out, by a suction canular if it is pre-12 weeks or, later, by dilatation and evacuation. The earlier the easier, both for the doctors and for the woman. 'Some larger foetuses,' says Paintin dispassionately, 'have to be destroyed and pulled out bit by bit; limb by limb.' </p> <p>He does not gloss over what an abortion consists of, but he does say, unequivocally, that it is actually a good thing. It is the price we pay for women's freedom. </p> <p>Although it is impossible to know exactly how many women had abortions before the 1967 Act made it legal, it has been reasonably calculated that the Act simply replaced illegal with legal abortions, and serious risk with reason able safety. The graph that shows the rate of abortion over the subsequent years is a pretty steady, gradual increase - with the odd blip here and there, caused by things like the Pill scare and the post-Aids emphasis on condoms (a fallible method of contraception). So, in 1971, there were 94,570 abortions in England and Wales; 10 years later this number had risen to 128,581; in 1999 the number stood at 183,250. </p> <p>Women are more likely to have abortions in their twenties than teens, thirties and forties. Most women (well over 60 per cent) say they got pregnant because of contraceptive failure. Every form of contraception is unreliable, especially those that require daily management (like the Pill) or are event-led (the slippery cap or splittable condom). If you have regular sex using contraception, then you are not 'irresponsible' if you get pregnant, simply one of the unlucky ones. </p> <p>Four times more single women than married ones have abortions. Paintin believes this is because married women are more accepting of their role as 'wife'. Single women, he says, are more intolerant of contraceptive failure. And as employment becomes more available for women, the rates of abortion go up. A professional single woman will plan motherhood - and if we have a problem with that image of an ambitious middle-class person ruthlessly putting her career in front of her unborn child, that's because we are still in thrall to the notion of abortion as something which mops up our shameful mistakes. </p> <p>Abortion is absolutely linked to social conditions. You can see the mirror image of the professional choosing to delay parenthood if you look at the socially and economically deprived. A survey conducted in Tayside recently compared rates of teenage pregnancy and abortion among women ranging from the very poor to the affluent. The most deprived teenagers were a shocking seven times more likely to get pregnant than their privileged peers. But they were several times less likely to have an abortion. Politicians and social commentators may call this behaviour irresponsible and condemn it. But actually these teenagers - who often come from broken families, live in rundown estates, leave school with few or no academic qualifications and have little sense of purpose or hope - are conforming to the adult role models they see around them and behaving in the way that is expected of them. For many girls, becoming a mother makes them into a woman; parenthood is a transition into desired adulthood. </p> <p>Those who criticise them are really thinking about their own privileged daughters, who have achieved at school and whose life would be thrown off course by having a baby at 16 or 17. </p> <p>Most women who choose to have a termination are not in extreme circumstances. They are most likely to be in their twenties and to want an abortion for 'social' reasons. There are no 'average' cases, but there are exemplary ones: Louise (let's call her) lives in the north of England. She is a professional single woman in her mid-twenties and two years ago she had an abortion. Eight months later she had a second one. The first pregnancy was a result of a 'one-night thing' with an old friend, shortly after a long-term relationship had ended. She was on the Pill: 'I never considered having it. I didn't tell him, he still doesn't know - but I talked to two friends, who came along with me. I went to the clinic when I was seven or eight weeks pregnant, and had the termination at nine weeks. </p> <p>'I never thought of it as a baby. I didn't think I was killing my baby and I still don't. I wasn't in a relationship. I couldn't provide the stability I would want to give my children, and that I had myself when I was a child. I didn't feel I was doing anything wrong, but I did feel upset. In the waiting room I sat there with all these other women - I'd thought they'd all be in their late teens, but every kind of woman was there, all of us going through the same thing, and we all sat there and stared at each other, and I wondered what their stories were. It was all done pretty quickly. I was out again after five or six hours. And it was such a relief. But I kept very quiet about it. It's a private thing, and I did feel as if I'd been invaded. I thought of it like cancer - I know it's completely different. But when you really don't want to be pregnant and it's growing inside you, well, I had completely lost control for a while.' </p> <p>Louise's second pregnancy happened eight months later. 'I was in a relationship. We were using condoms. I never had evidence that it had split; maybe he didn't tell me. It was much worse this time. I said after the first: \"It's never going to happen again\", and to have it happen again, it was horrendous. I told my boyfriend, and he said: \"It's up to you.\" That made it more difficult, because he was involved, and the decision wasn't so completely obvious. But I didn't want a baby. I wanted my job, my life. I didn't tell my friends about it this time round. I suppose I felt ashamed that it had happened again. At seven weeks I had the termination. </p> <p>'I didn't have sex for a long time after that. It felt like the end with my boyfriend; I didn't know what to say to him. The door seemed closed. Now - well, I'm never going to be someone who hasn't had an abortion. It's always going to be there. Somehow I felt that these things happen to other women; people who aren't careful, risk-takers. It made the notion of control fragile. Things can happen to you, however careful you are. I know there are some women who experience terrible guilt. I didn't feel that. I think abortions should be available for women like me. I don't think we should feel ashamed. I feel I made the right decision, but I wish it hadn't happened.' </p> <p>For someone like Louise it was implacably her decision. She had lost control of her life, and by having a termination was regaining it. Every so often a man will try to stop his partner having an abortion, and we enter a jungle of moral issues. Should men have any legal rights over the potential child? Over the bundle of cells inside a woman's body? </p> <p>A few weeks ago one such case hit the headlines. Stephen Hone claimed the right, as a potential father, to stop his girlfriend, Claire Hansell, having an abortion. He claimed the unborn child as his - his to care for and bring up. But she got to the clinic before he got to the court. There is no middle ground between these two positions, no compromise possible between a woman choosing to be in control of her fertility, body and life, and a man insisting on joint responsibility and rights (ironically, the kind of responsibility that women often urge men to take after the baby is born). </p> <p>There is a myth that the one-in-three women who have abortions every year don't care, take the decision lightly - that they have casual, unprotected sex and then casual terminations. Even women who have had abortions somehow manage to hold this view of the 'others'. For some women, says one health professional, there are three reasons to have an abortion: rape, incest and me. And from this notion of the feckless, uncontrolled woman comes our disapproval of the 'easy' abortion - the hundreds of thousands of morning-after pills sold over the counter; the walk-in clinics; the swelling numbers; the lack of guilt. Women must be made to confront what they've done. </p> <p>There's no evidence that the decision is reached lightly. I've never met a woman who was casual or light-hearted about it. Ann Furedi, spokesperson for the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, says that many women who assume they would have a termination if the situation arose suddenly find themselves ambivalent when it does; and women who have always sworn they would never have an abortion find they cannot go through with their pregnancy. 'For a woman, it is startling to think that, if nothing is done, in nine months she will have a child and her life will be dramatically changed. Motherhood is no longer an abstract or philosophical idea but a reality. It is hugely important not to dismiss the moral issues of abortion, but yet to put them in the context of a woman's own particular circumstances. It is an insult put about by the anti-abortion lobby that women are somehow unaware that a foetus is a potential child.' </p> <p>Furedi feels that abortion should be easy, the easier the better. The experience should be as forgettable as possible. 'That is not trivialising it. Society should trust women more to make the appropriate choices and moral judgments. It's horrific that some people seem to feel that if we don't regulate abortion tightly, then everyone will have one; the floodgates will open. We don't need these laws. Women and their doctors should be trusted a bit more.' </p> <p>It is a legal and medical requirement to give counselling to a woman seeking an abortion, both to help her consider her options beforehand, and, if she wants, to give her post-abortion counselling. David Paintin says that most women who come to the clinics know already what they want to do, and have already talked to someone (partner, husband, family, friends or doctor). 'There is not a single study that shows that post-abortion counselling helps a woman,' he says. 'Counselling feeds some kind of fantasy we have that the woman should be saved.' </p> <p>Rachel, who has been a counsellor for several years and has seen 'several thousand' women both before and after their abortions, more or less agrees. Women talk through their options with her beforehand, but usually, she says, they have already decided what it is they want to do. 'Usually they know what they want. They are grown-ups, moral beings. They don't want to sit in front of me explaining themselves in-depth.' </p> <p>She goes on: 'Quite a lot of women absolutely know what they want, but feel bad about it, or anxious about what social attitudes towards them will be. I am not confident even now, with abortion so widely used, that women feel it's OK to want an abortion without feeling guilty. They say: \"Am I some sort of monster that I feel all right about this?\" ' </p> <p> 'She isn't a monster, of course. She's like all of us. She's Everywoman. Sometimes women come in and say: \"I can't believe how many people are out there in the waiting room.\" It's not a complaint; they feel such relief that they aren't alone.' </p> <p>Maxine Lattimer is a health worker who sat in on counselling sessions with women seeking abortions over several weeks. The women she listened to were white, black, married, unmarried, middle and working class, articulate and sure, nervous and emotional. One of them had been raped by her husband, who wanted her to give him a child. Several already had children. One was about to return to work after her first baby. One was about to go to college. None of them was 'ready'. Many of them felt the need to justify themselves to the counsellor. They tried to find the right words to explain themselves. They didn't want to feel guilty for something they thought was right.' </p> <p>People who say 'she should have thought' generally harbour another, puritanical shadow-thought: 'she shouldn't have had sex'. As Ann Furedi says, it is difficult to 'manage' sexuality and 'contain' it. For most of us, sex is spontaneous, passionate and abandoned. Better contraceptive use and more sex education are to be welcomed, but we will continue to take risks and make mistakes. </p> <p>The English do not deal well with sex; we treat it as both smutty and salacious. Men and women find it hard to negotiate sexual relationships. We tend (no matter how we behaved when we were younger) to think that teenagers really shouldn't be having sex at all. </p> <p>Moreover, there's a puritanical unease about women's bodies, perhaps a distaste for the messiness of all the female processes. Women bleed, evacuate their eggs monthly, have coils implanted in them; they conceive, their bodies swell, they have foetuses sucked out of their wombs. It's not very natural, is it? Is this why it's kept so quiet, remaining a secret, a guilt, a stigma, a shame: the great A-word, unspoken. </p> <p> British Pregnancy Advisory Service: 08457 304030 </p> <p><strong>Why I had my abortion</strong></p> <p>Chantal was 19 when she discovered she was pregnant. When she first found out, she didn't know what to do or how to feel. She told her boyfriend, whom she'd been going out with for about six months, and he simply said it was up to her. 'He didn't cuddle me, though, or tell me everything would be all right.' After a week she built up the courage to tell her parents, who reacted well, discussed it with her, and didn't push her towards her decision. She rang the family planning clinic, told them she wanted an abortion and was booked in for an appointment. She begged her boyfriend to come with her but he refused. He had started to become very distant. Chantal felt she could only really talk to her mother and to her best friend. Her mother went with her to the hospital. Later Chantal split with her boyfriend.

She and her boyfriend decided not to tell their parents and to arrange an abortion as quickly as possible. But when their friends began to gossip they told their parents. His wanted her to keep the baby. Hers were 'so understanding' about her decision to have an abortion. Looking back, she says she doesn't know 'how I could possibly have thought I'd get through it without them. They agreed with my decision completely and tried to support me.' She was 10 weeks pregnant by the time of the abortion and had 'lots of different feelings about the baby', even though she knew she wasn't going to keep it. She found herself thinking about its sex, what it would look like. Her boyfriend started seeing someone else during this period, 'and everyone apart from my parents seemed to think it was so easy and straightforward to have an abortion. On the day of the operation she was very scared, and 'totally alone. I can honestly say that was the lowest point of my whole life. I felt so lonely, as if no one understood. When I came round from the operation, I thought: \"What have I done?\" I had such regrets and this terrible pain in my stomach. I was an emotional wreck. My ex-boyfriend and my friends couldn't understand why I was so depressed.' When she started university, however, she felt happy again, although she dreaded relationships for a year. She thinks she made the right decision - 'although it was one of the most awful experiences of my whole life.

Her eldest son had a heart problem so he needed a lot of attention. The youngest had been in hospital recently with suspected meningitis. Initially Carla thought she had missed her period because of stress. She was very shocked when she found out she was pregnant. At first she decided she would keep the baby, but then thought about the children she had already. The two babies were a lot of work and the eldest would get even less attention if she had another child. It was not fair on them.

      "bodyText": "'It was as if I had failed somehow.' 'I didn't think it was wrong, but I wish, I really wish, it hadn't happened.' 'I thought: how could I let this happen to me; this kind of thing happens to other people.' 'People think you're careless, irresponsible, immoral - not like them.' 'I couldn't talk.' 'It was a secret.' In this country between 30 and 40 per cent of women have an abortion; one in three. Two hundred thousand women every year have a pregnancy terminated. They are in their teens, their twenties, their thirties, their forties; they are single women and married ones; childless or with a family. It is a common experience, although we don't talk of it as common or normal - in fact, we usually don't talk about it at all. It has been legal for over 30 years, and only eight per cent of the population think that it should not be. These eight per cent are outside of the pragmatic argument about time limits and doctors' rights not to perform terminations - for them, all abortion is wrong, a form of murder incomprehensibly legitimised by society. The fact is, abortion has gradually but steadily increased over the last decade, and in spite of protests by the anti-abortion lobby there is no sign that we will ever return to the back-street days. Abortion, like contraception, is part of the fabric of modern society; the means by which contemporary women take control of their fertility and their lives. Perhaps it is time, finally, to think of it in the same way that we think of contraception: as a necessary and helpful intervention, as a way of making women equal, as a positive sign that women are taking control of their lives. Abortion is the way we live now. Yet we continue to argue about abortion, hold passionate moral opinions, worry over the rights and wrongs of it. And this perpetual, unresolved anxiety is actually reflected in the law, for in this country each woman who chooses a termination must, in a sense, argue her case, and persuade two doctors to ratify her decision. While, in the last 30 years, abortions have increased and become, bit by bit, more publicly acceptable, the language with which we talk about them has remained stubbornly the same. Rather than speaking of the 'foetus' we talk about the 'unborn child', a phrase coined by anti-abortion-groups. This phrase, along with the posters like that of a tender, curled foetus held in the palm of a hand, implicitly brands all women who have an abortion as murderers. We use an emotional and judgmental vocabulary of shame and guilt, directed almost exclusively at the woman. To have an abortion is 'the lesser of two evils'; a woman has been 'careless' or 'irresponsible' or 'selfish'; she should have known better; she shouldn't have got carried away; this will be a lesson. Good women don't have abortions. Bad girls do. And there is a sense that these bad girls - feckless girls who've had too much sex, with too little care - should suffer for their mistakes. Abortions shouldn't be too easy. In the United States the rhetoric is far more extreme and the direct action more violent. Three weeks ago anti-abortionists won the right to publish on the internet what amounts to a hit-list of doctors who provide terminations for pregnant women. The site is known as the 'Nuremberg Files' (because, for the anti-abortionists, abortion amounts to a Holocaust of unborn babies); abortions are called 'Satan's food source'. The doctors are 'baby butchers'. Those performing terminations are not just the target of this wrenched, pornographic language but of death threats and physical abuse. Seven have been murdered in the past 10 years. If David Paintin had lived in the United States, he too would presumably be named butcher and murderer, and his name posted on the site. He is the Emeritus Reader of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at St Mary's, London, a courteous, grey-haired man who for 27 years - until his retirement from the front line in 1990 - performed hundreds, thousands, of terminations. Now he lives in a lovely house in the countryside, reads books about shipbuilding, tends his pretty garden - and remains tirelessly active in the abortion reform campaign and radical in his unblinking commitment to the rights of women to choose. Paintin's father was a Methodist minister, and he himself used to be a religious man. Now he calls himself an 'almost atheist' and a humanist. In 1956, when he was just starting out as a young and idealistic doctor, he worked with Dougal Baird in Aberdeen, where abortion was only a civil offence. Here they came across the poor and exhausted wives of fishermen, who had more children that they could cope with and who were often at breaking point. 'The women needed abortions,' says Paintin. 'Doctors could do them more safely. It was a utilitarian kind of ethics - no firm, fixed rules, but a practical approach.' He has provided women with terminations ever since. Most of them were early ones (a good 80 per cent of abortions are pre-12 weeks gestation). Some were later. Only a small fraction of one per cent take place after 24 weeks - because a woman had thought she was menopausal, infertile, because she is scared, in denial, in ignorance and terror and swamping panic. 'But yes, I would do those too if a woman requested it and persuaded me that she was justified in her request.' When I wince at the thought of an abortion this late on, he says firmly: 'In my opinion a foetus is not a person in the way a woman is. Personhood is conferred by the woman giving birth. It is an act. It has no ethical status until it is independent and breathing air.' He smiles dryly, and adds: 'I am well aware that this is a position that some people feel very uncomfortable with.' I ask him to describe methods of termination, and he does so carefully and unemotionally. There are two basic ways of having an abortion. The first is with drugs, so that labour is induced - an experience much closer, clearly, to giving birth to a baby, and which some women choose precisely in order to participate in the process and to feel a kind of bereavement and closure at the end of it; some even hold the foetus before relinquishing it. The other method is suction. The foetus is pulled out, by a suction canular if it is pre-12 weeks or, later, by dilatation and evacuation. The earlier the easier, both for the doctors and for the woman. 'Some larger foetuses,' says Paintin dispassionately, 'have to be destroyed and pulled out bit by bit; limb by limb.' He does not gloss over what an abortion consists of, but he does say, unequivocally, that it is actually a good thing. It is the price we pay for women's freedom. Although it is impossible to know exactly how many women had abortions before the 1967 Act made it legal, it has been reasonably calculated that the Act simply replaced illegal with legal abortions, and serious risk with reason able safety. The graph that shows the rate of abortion over the subsequent years is a pretty steady, gradual increase - with the odd blip here and there, caused by things like the Pill scare and the post-Aids emphasis on condoms (a fallible method of contraception). So, in 1971, there were 94,570 abortions in England and Wales; 10 years later this number had risen to 128,581; in 1999 the number stood at 183,250. Women are more likely to have abortions in their twenties than teens, thirties and forties. Most women (well over 60 per cent) say they got pregnant because of contraceptive failure. Every form of contraception is unreliable, especially those that require daily management (like the Pill) or are event-led (the slippery cap or splittable condom). If you have regular sex using contraception, then you are not 'irresponsible' if you get pregnant, simply one of the unlucky ones. Four times more single women than married ones have abortions. Paintin believes this is because married women are more accepting of their role as 'wife'. Single women, he says, are more intolerant of contraceptive failure. And as employment becomes more available for women, the rates of abortion go up. A professional single woman will plan motherhood - and if we have a problem with that image of an ambitious middle-class person ruthlessly putting her career in front of her unborn child, that's because we are still in thrall to the notion of abortion as something which mops up our shameful mistakes. Abortion is absolutely linked to social conditions. You can see the mirror image of the professional choosing to delay parenthood if you look at the socially and economically deprived. A survey conducted in Tayside recently compared rates of teenage pregnancy and abortion among women ranging from the very poor to the affluent. The most deprived teenagers were a shocking seven times more likely to get pregnant than their privileged peers. But they were several times less likely to have an abortion. Politicians and social commentators may call this behaviour irresponsible and condemn it. But actually these teenagers - who often come from broken families, live in rundown estates, leave school with few or no academic qualifications and have little sense of purpose or hope - are conforming to the adult role models they see around them and behaving in the way that is expected of them. For many girls, becoming a mother makes them into a woman; parenthood is a transition into desired adulthood. Those who criticise them are really thinking about their own privileged daughters, who have achieved at school and whose life would be thrown off course by having a baby at 16 or 17. Most women who choose to have a termination are not in extreme circumstances. They are most likely to be in their twenties and to want an abortion for 'social' reasons. There are no 'average' cases, but there are exemplary ones: Louise (let's call her) lives in the north of England. She is a professional single woman in her mid-twenties and two years ago she had an abortion. Eight months later she had a second one. The first pregnancy was a result of a 'one-night thing' with an old friend, shortly after a long-term relationship had ended. She was on the Pill: 'I never considered having it. I didn't tell him, he still doesn't know - but I talked to two friends, who came along with me. I went to the clinic when I was seven or eight weeks pregnant, and had the termination at nine weeks. 'I never thought of it as a baby. I didn't think I was killing my baby and I still don't. I wasn't in a relationship. I couldn't provide the stability I would want to give my children, and that I had myself when I was a child. I didn't feel I was doing anything wrong, but I did feel upset. In the waiting room I sat there with all these other women - I'd thought they'd all be in their late teens, but every kind of woman was there, all of us going through the same thing, and we all sat there and stared at each other, and I wondered what their stories were. It was all done pretty quickly. I was out again after five or six hours. And it was such a relief. But I kept very quiet about it. It's a private thing, and I did feel as if I'd been invaded. I thought of it like cancer - I know it's completely different. But when you really don't want to be pregnant and it's growing inside you, well, I had completely lost control for a while.' Louise's second pregnancy happened eight months later. 'I was in a relationship. We were using condoms. I never had evidence that it had split; maybe he didn't tell me. It was much worse this time. I said after the first: \"It's never going to happen again\", and to have it happen again, it was horrendous. I told my boyfriend, and he said: \"It's up to you.\" That made it more difficult, because he was involved, and the decision wasn't so completely obvious. But I didn't want a baby. I wanted my job, my life. I didn't tell my friends about it this time round. I suppose I felt ashamed that it had happened again. At seven weeks I had the termination. 'I didn't have sex for a long time after that. It felt like the end with my boyfriend; I didn't know what to say to him. The door seemed closed. Now - well, I'm never going to be someone who hasn't had an abortion. It's always going to be there. Somehow I felt that these things happen to other women; people who aren't careful, risk-takers. It made the notion of control fragile. Things can happen to you, however careful you are. I know there are some women who experience terrible guilt. I didn't feel that. I think abortions should be available for women like me. I don't think we should feel ashamed. I feel I made the right decision, but I wish it hadn't happened.' For someone like Louise it was implacably her decision. She had lost control of her life, and by having a termination was regaining it. Every so often a man will try to stop his partner having an abortion, and we enter a jungle of moral issues. Should men have any legal rights over the potential child? Over the bundle of cells inside a woman's body? A few weeks ago one such case hit the headlines. Stephen Hone claimed the right, as a potential father, to stop his girlfriend, Claire Hansell, having an abortion. He claimed the unborn child as his - his to care for and bring up. But she got to the clinic before he got to the court. There is no middle ground between these two positions, no compromise possible between a woman choosing to be in control of her fertility, body and life, and a man insisting on joint responsibility and rights (ironically, the kind of responsibility that women often urge men to take after the baby is born). There is a myth that the one-in-three women who have abortions every year don't care, take the decision lightly - that they have casual, unprotected sex and then casual terminations. Even women who have had abortions somehow manage to hold this view of the 'others'. For some women, says one health professional, there are three reasons to have an abortion: rape, incest and me. And from this notion of the feckless, uncontrolled woman comes our disapproval of the 'easy' abortion - the hundreds of thousands of morning-after pills sold over the counter; the walk-in clinics; the swelling numbers; the lack of guilt. Women must be made to confront what they've done. There's no evidence that the decision is reached lightly. I've never met a woman who was casual or light-hearted about it. Ann Furedi, spokesperson for the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, says that many women who assume they would have a termination if the situation arose suddenly find themselves ambivalent when it does; and women who have always sworn they would never have an abortion find they cannot go through with their pregnancy. 'For a woman, it is startling to think that, if nothing is done, in nine months she will have a child and her life will be dramatically changed. Motherhood is no longer an abstract or philosophical idea but a reality. It is hugely important not to dismiss the moral issues of abortion, but yet to put them in the context of a woman's own particular circumstances. It is an insult put about by the anti-abortion lobby that women are somehow unaware that a foetus is a potential child.' Furedi feels that abortion should be easy, the easier the better. The experience should be as forgettable as possible. 'That is not trivialising it. Society should trust women more to make the appropriate choices and moral judgments. It's horrific that some people seem to feel that if we don't regulate abortion tightly, then everyone will have one; the floodgates will open. We don't need these laws. Women and their doctors should be trusted a bit more.' It is a legal and medical requirement to give counselling to a woman seeking an abortion, both to help her consider her options beforehand, and, if she wants, to give her post-abortion counselling. David Paintin says that most women who come to the clinics know already what they want to do, and have already talked to someone (partner, husband, family, friends or doctor). 'There is not a single study that shows that post-abortion counselling helps a woman,' he says. 'Counselling feeds some kind of fantasy we have that the woman should be saved.' Rachel, who has been a counsellor for several years and has seen 'several thousand' women both before and after their abortions, more or less agrees. Women talk through their options with her beforehand, but usually, she says, they have already decided what it is they want to do. 'Usually they know what they want. They are grown-ups, moral beings. They don't want to sit in front of me explaining themselves in-depth.' She goes on: 'Quite a lot of women absolutely know what they want, but feel bad about it, or anxious about what social attitudes towards them will be. I am not confident even now, with abortion so widely used, that women feel it's OK to want an abortion without feeling guilty. They say: \"Am I some sort of monster that I feel all right about this?\" ' 'She isn't a monster, of course. She's like all of us. She's Everywoman. Sometimes women come in and say: \"I can't believe how many people are out there in the waiting room.\" It's not a complaint; they feel such relief that they aren't alone.' Maxine Lattimer is a health worker who sat in on counselling sessions with women seeking abortions over several weeks. The women she listened to were white, black, married, unmarried, middle and working class, articulate and sure, nervous and emotional. One of them had been raped by her husband, who wanted her to give him a child. Several already had children. One was about to return to work after her first baby. One was about to go to college. None of them was 'ready'. Many of them felt the need to justify themselves to the counsellor. They tried to find the right words to explain themselves. They didn't want to feel guilty for something they thought was right.' People who say 'she should have thought' generally harbour another, puritanical shadow-thought: 'she shouldn't have had sex'. As Ann Furedi says, it is difficult to 'manage' sexuality and 'contain' it. For most of us, sex is spontaneous, passionate and abandoned. Better contraceptive use and more sex education are to be welcomed, but we will continue to take risks and make mistakes. The English do not deal well with sex; we treat it as both smutty and salacious. Men and women find it hard to negotiate sexual relationships. We tend (no matter how we behaved when we were younger) to think that teenagers really shouldn't be having sex at all. Moreover, there's a puritanical unease about women's bodies, perhaps a distaste for the messiness of all the female processes. Women bleed, evacuate their eggs monthly, have coils implanted in them; they conceive, their bodies swell, they have foetuses sucked out of their wombs. It's not very natural, is it? Is this why it's kept so quiet, remaining a secret, a guilt, a stigma, a shame: the great A-word, unspoken.

From case studies conducted by Alison Hadley of Brook and Maxine Lattimer of the British Pregnancy Advisory Service Abortion in Britain and the USA 1967 Abortion Act passed making abortion legal in England, Wales and Scotland. 1973 The US Supreme Court legalises abortion in the first three months across the US. 1982 Pro-life militant kidnaps an abortion doctor and his wife and holds them for eight days before releasing them unharmed. 1998 Dr Barnett Slepian is shot and killed, bringing the number of abortion doctors murdered in the States to seven. 2000 Abortions in England rise by 20 per cent after Millennium celebrations. In Britain, abortion is a non-party political issue. The US has 47 pro-life senators and 34 pro-choice senators. Attorney General John Ashcroft is opposed to abortion.

Where families have extensive property, it is logical in a hard-nosed way to follow strict inheritance laws, but hardly in middle-class families where disposable assets consist of a house, a car and a time-share at most.</p> <p>I can think of few things more deplorable than members of one generation waiting for the older folk to turn up their toes, mentally rubbing their hands and taking stock. It's likely that your in-laws have worked hard throughout their lives togarner what possessions they have, and rightfully look upon them as their own, to dispose of as they will.</p> <p>If they are fit and active, enjoying many pastimes in retirement, it is natural that they will examine all ways to enhance their income to support those interests. Above all, they need peace of mind, that whatever unexpected events may arise, they have the wherewithal to deal with them. They are accountable to no one in this planning.</p> <p>If their children are in their thirties, having been supported and educated to make their own way in life, they might reasonably think their duty has been thoroughly done. Anything left over to hand on at the appropriate time comes as a gift, not as a right.</p> <p>It seems particularly infelicitous and insensitive that you, not even a descendant, should be the one expressing anger. Nor is it wise to bank on in-laws as a source of future affluence. My ex-mother-in-law always made it clear to her husband and to me that as we were only wedded relations, her money would bypass us, destined for her son and grandsons. Her husband might outlive her, remarry and beget another family; I might divorce her son (she was right, I did). Most people who have wealth to hand on adopt this attitude. Though you have no thoughts of your marriage breaking up, events have a way of sneaking up on you.</p> <p>You have no claims and no reason to be angry. The terms of the equity are a calculated gamble, as in any form of insurance, that they will live to a ripe old age in order to gain good value from the arrangement.

      "bodyText": "My mother-in-law has revealed to us that she and her husband have entered a scheme whereby she has taken the equity on the house to use it in their retirement. This means the house will belong to the company when they die, not passed down to my husband and his two sisters. It means we'll have no opportunity to inherit a significant amount of money and improve our lifestyle. Am I justified in my anger or should I be glad my parents-in-law will be able to have a worry-free retirement? D.C. of London The expectation of inheriting wealth from one's forebears raises inordinate emotional tension when it is viewed as an entitlement. Where families have extensive property, it is logical in a hard-nosed way to follow strict inheritance laws, but hardly in middle-class families where disposable assets consist of a house, a car and a time-share at most. I can think of few things more deplorable than members of one generation waiting for the older folk to turn up their toes, mentally rubbing their hands and taking stock. It's likely that your in-laws have worked hard throughout their lives togarner what possessions they have, and rightfully look upon them as their own, to dispose of as they will. If they are fit and active, enjoying many pastimes in retirement, it is natural that they will examine all ways to enhance their income to support those interests. Above all, they need peace of mind, that whatever unexpected events may arise, they have the wherewithal to deal with them. They are accountable to no one in this planning. If their children are in their thirties, having been supported and educated to make their own way in life, they might reasonably think their duty has been thoroughly done. Anything left over to hand on at the appropriate time comes as a gift, not as a right. It seems particularly infelicitous and insensitive that you, not even a descendant, should be the one expressing anger. Nor is it wise to bank on in-laws as a source of future affluence. My ex-mother-in-law always made it clear to her husband and to me that as we were only wedded relations, her money would bypass us, destined for her son and grandsons. Her husband might outlive her, remarry and beget another family; I might divorce her son (she was right, I did). Most people who have wealth to hand on adopt this attitude. Though you have no thoughts of your marriage breaking up, events have a way of sneaking up on you. You have no claims and no reason to be angry. The terms of the equity are a calculated gamble, as in any form of insurance, that they will live to a ripe old age in order to gain good value from the arrangement. The company, of course, counts on the converse. Your in-laws are probably confident that they will get the best of the deal. They may also feel that as you have no expectations from them, all the affection you show towards them will be genuine. Good luck to them, say I.

      "body": "<p>Eve Ensler's nickname is the 'vagina lady'. She remembers standing in a shoe store in New York and someone shouting: 'There's the vagina lady!' It was 'bizarre' but she did not mind. Vaginas are her vocation. She has succeeded in making a private part unmissably public, not only in the States but all over the world. Here are some of the things that have happened since she wrote The Vagina Monologues for an off-off Broadway theatre in 1997: </p> <p> The Monologues, a 90-minute distillation of more than 200 interviews with women about their vaginas, have been performed in 20 countries and translated into 20 languages. They have won an Obie (off-Broadway theatre award) and been voted Play of the Year in Paris. Ensler has launched a global movement to stop violence against women and, on 'V Day' each year, charity performances of the monologues raise money for her cause. She has emerged as a phenomenal mover and shaker, with the play at her service. </p> <p>In the introduction to the British edition of the Monologues (published by Virago on 3 May) she describes V Day's inception: 'As I travelled with the piece to city after city, country after country, hundreds of women waited after the show to talk to me about their lives. The play had somehow freed up their memories, pain and desire. Night after night I heard the same stories - women being raped as teenagers, in college, as little girls, as elderly women; women who had finally escaped being beaten to death by their husbands; women who were terrified to leave; women who were taken sexually before they were even conscious of sex... I began to feel insane, as if a door had opened to some underworld...' </p> <p>She couldn't stand it. She had to act. The most recent V Day took place in New York's Madison Square Gardens on 10 February and was attended by 16,000 people. The performers, dressed in pink and red, broadcast the monologues to an audience most of whom had paid $1,000 each for their tickets. Some $2 million was raised, and Ensler has herself become directly involved with many of the charities, including Rawa, the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan. </p> <p>Now she is coming to London to perform the Monologues - ostensibly for the last time - in a four-week season at the New Ambassadors. After that, the show will be performed by trios of celebrities for three-week stints until September. The show's producer Sally Greene does not want to drop names but Jerry Hall's interest has been widely reported and, if America is anything to go by, casting should prove a piece of cake. </p> <p>Glenn Close (who Ensler boasts got '2,500 people to stand up and chant the word cunt \") describes the effect of The Vagina Monologues on her: 'I feel my life has changed. You don't just hook up with Eve, you become part of her crusade. There is a corps of us who are Eve's army.' Other recruits include: Meryl Streep, Jane Fonda, Calista Flockhart, Brooke Shields, Whoopi Goldberg, Erica Jong, Rosie Perez, Winona Ryder, Oprah Winfrey, Donna Hanover (the estranged wife of New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani) and Robin Givens (Mike Tyson's ex-wife). Gillian Anderson sums it up: 'Eve Ensler is the Pied Piper. She's leading women and the world to a different consciousness of the essence of women.' </p> <p>Not everyone is as enthusiastic. There are actors who refuse to join in. The 'V-word' itself may be partly to blame. Ensler once noted: 'Women call up for tickets to the Monologues; men ask for tickets to the 'Vagina Chronicles'. </p> <p>I like the sound of Vagina Chronicles - it's jauntily medieval - but fall into the first category of ticket buyers. I have been referring to the Monologues all week, and when I ring Eve Ensler in New York, plan to tell her so. She answers the phone in what seems an absurdly over-sexy voice until I realise she is ill; she has worn her voice out with lecturing all over the States about violence towards women. I express unease but do not add that I worry the piece trades on taboo. Nor do I say that I find the tone of the monologues uneven - often whimsical, fey, showy. Ensler once described herself as a playwright with 'exhibitionist tendencies'. </p> <p>How common is it to feel squeamish? 'Very. It is partly prudishness. For a long time vaginas have not been visible, part of the dialogue, part of the equation.' It is important, she argues, to ask: 'Why does the word revolt us?' She shares some sense of resistance herself: 'It doesn't matter how many times I perform, there is this incredible wall. It may take 30 seconds to get over, sometimes it will take the whole show.' </p> <p>Different countries react positively to different pieces in the monologues. The section on 'hair' which begins 'You cannot love a vagina unless you love hair' was, Ensler says, 'really big' in Rome. But on the whole it does not matter whether she is in Rio, Rome or Jerusalem: 'Sitting in the dark performing, I wouldn't have any idea of where I was.' All that mattered was not to be 'ahead' of an audience, not to be 'over-relaxed'. </p> <p>Ensler, 47, has every reason not to be over-relaxed, as a survivor of parental abuse herself. She grew up in the wealthy New York City suburb of Scarsdale and was 'violated' by her father until she was 10. She has a stepson by her first husband and in one of the most arresting of the Monologues describes the birth of his first child: 'I was there when her vagina changed/ from a shy sexual hole/ to an archeological tunnel, a sacred vessel, a Venetian canal, a deep well with a tiny child stuck inside/ waiting to be rescued.' </p> <p>Evidently it was Ensler's second husband, Ariel Orr Jordan, an Israeli-born psychotherapist and artist, who got the piece off the ground. (I find myself obscurely disappointed to see a man being given the credit for its conception). </p> <p>Ensler remembers the intensity of interviewing for the Monologues: 'So many women wanted to talk to me that I was shacked up in my office for weeks. And I still get hundreds of stories'. All she had to do was listen, and curb her 'American compulsion to fix and heal'. It taught her this: 'Your vagina is the story of your life, no doubt about that.' </p> <p>One of the monologues describes a workshop in which women draw pictures of their vaginas. 'One woman who was pregnant drew a big red mouth screaming with coins spilling out. Another very skinny woman drew a big serving plate with a kind of Devonshire pattern on it. I drew a huge black dot with little squiggly lines around it.' By the end of the workshop she has improved on the black dot, deciding that: 'It was better than the Grand Canyon, ancient and full of grace. It had the innocence and freshness of a proper English garden. It was funny, very funny. It made me laugh. It could hide and seek, open and close. It was a mouth. It was the morning.' </p> <p>Ensler enjoys the 'funny' side of her subject. One of her friends inspired the piece that begins: 'If your vagina got dressed, what would it wear?' 'There was one friend in particular who told me that if her vagina got dressed it would wear a beret. She was going through a French phrase.' She collects odd 'vagina facts'. She reports on a young man who made her a 'vagina salad' for dinner with his parents in Atlanta, Georgia with beansprouts as pubic hair. </p> <p>I tell her that I think she writes about vaginas as if about an unsung heroine, as if rescuing a subject from darkness. Is this how she sees it? 'Absolutely. I think that the fact that we have these extraordinary things between our legs is comparable to the ways in which women are 'undervalued and invisible.' The vagina as a metaphor then? 'Yes.' </p> <p>She asks herself in the text: does it matter if the work is a turn-on? But she does not answer her own question. Now she says that if men find it erotic, that is OK because it is about women's sexuality. 'I want us to live in a world in which women can be open and can be sexual... And you know what? It is not pornography.' </p> <p>She believes women need to overcome their resistance and that when they do there is a sense of necessary release. 'Women are so hungry for it, so sexual but they are contorted and drained by the patriarchal society.' </p> <p>As she speaks, I find myself wondering what she looks like. I picture her dressed like a cowboy (with a nifty lasso). Sally Greene, producer of The Vagina Monologues, puts me right. 'She looks like Louise Brooks - the black bob and the red lipstick - and she wears slinky red and black dresses. She is feminine but works in a feminist way.' She adds: 'She can bowl you over. She is at once serious and light.' </p> <p>It was Sally Greene who first brought the Monologues to the King's Head theatre in London three years ago, where it sold out. I asked her what she thought made it special. 'Things I would never dare think about or talk about with a husband or boyfriend are on that page.' Antonia Hodgson, Ensler's British editor, expands on this: 'We have never talked as women about vaginas. It is such a surprise when you read it. It has nothing to do with being erotic. We should be proud - celebrate - but also think. It does not set out to be polemical, yet becomes so as it airs the subject. </p> <p>There have been few dissenting voices. Men in particular seem unable to comment unfavourably. I was impressed, therefore, by Arnold Wesker's verdict. He has written: 'I felt large parts of it were sentimental; parts I just didn't believe, felt they were not honest; at moments, I felt the writing was smug, self-satisfied, too pleased with itself. I came away from the show with mixed feelings. It seemed to be dangerous but wasn't really... it had moments of humour, some facts were new to me, the stories of vicious rape were distressing but there was something missing. An honesty, I think, about the difficulty of human relationships. When every woman in the world is at peace with her vagina she will still have to face - as men do - the inherent difficulty of human relationships.' </p> <p>A few critics have dismissed the show as old hat (circa 1970). And while it is true that the vagina is hardly a new subject, it has not in the past tended to please. Between 1973-9 there was a piece of fine art by Judy Chicago called 'Dinner Party', consisting of a triangular table with plates, upon each of which was the image of a vagina. You can inspect it on the internet at (<a href=\"http://www.nyu.edu/classes/finearts/karmel/modern/m_69.html\">www.nyu.edu/classes/finearts/karmel/modern/m_69.html</a>). The vagina resembles an erupting poppadom. It caused a stir at the time but as a celebration was unsuccessful. </p> <p>In the early Nineties Virago published a novel by an author with the pen name Euridyce. F32 was written from the point of view of a vagina. Opinion within Virago was divided. It did not get a single review and sank without trace. </p> <p>Somewhere in the Monologues, Ensler wonders if she may be tampering with mystery. What did she decide? 'No! The more you know, the more mysterious the vagina becomes. Mystery is not based on ignorance.' </p> <p>Eve is the right name for her, but unlike her biblical namesake she believes that tasting the fruit is the only way to stay in paradise. Did she ever wish she had selected another body part? She replied, quite seriously, that her next book takes in all the bits she has so far neglected and is called The Good Body . </p> <p> Vagina Monologues opens at the New Ambassadors Theatre, London WC2 on 8 May</p>",

It caused a stir at the time but as a celebration was unsuccessful. In the early Nineties Virago published a novel by an author with the pen name Euridyce. F32 was written from the point of view of a vagina. Opinion within Virago was divided. It did not get a single review and sank without trace. Somewhere in the Monologues, Ensler wonders if she may be tampering with mystery. What did she decide? 'No! The more you know, the more mysterious the vagina becomes. Mystery is not based on ignorance.' Eve is the right name for her, but unlike her biblical namesake she believes that tasting the fruit is the only way to stay in paradise. Did she ever wish she had selected another body part? She replied, quite seriously, that her next book takes in all the bits she has so far neglected and is called The Good Body . Vagina Monologues opens at the New Ambassadors Theatre, London WC2 on 8 May",

      "body": "<p>There are probably better places in the world to go to become invisible than Cambridge, but perhaps not if you are an ex-rock star with arty inclinations, dubious mental stability and a fragile, relationship with the past. If you happen to be bald and overweight into the bargain, it's virtually made for you. With a population of only 109,000, it combines Olde English charm with sophistication, and has students that actually look like students. But, amid the academia, greenery and gentility, what you really can't help but notice are the big bald blokes - hundreds of them, all heading into late middle age, all in the region of 15 stone, all wandering the streets mumbling to themselves.</p> <p>I'm here on the spiritual trail of one of rock's most enigmatic figures, Syd Barrett, the former leader of Pink Floyd, who went into hiding in the early Seventies after several drug-related breakdowns and never came out. But like most Barrett fans, I've made the mistake of picturing Barrett still as he was in the late Sixties - slim, tousled, kaftanned, tassled. The reality couldn't be more different: paparazzi shots snatched outside his house in 1980 depict a rotund, receding figure staring vacantly at something at least 3,000 miles behind the camera lens. And that was 21 years ago - which leaves me searching for some nebulous amalgam of Benny from Crossroads , Marlon Brando and the Michael Jackson impersonator from The Simpsons .</p> <p>And here he is! 'Excuse me!' I ask the spherical figure who's just ambled past me, head down, chuntering. 'I'm writing a piece about Syd Barrett.'</p> <p>'Who?'</p> <p>'Syd Barrett. He used to be in Pink Floyd.'</p> <p>'Never heard of 'im. Is he one of them rappers?'</p> <p>'No - he was a psychedelic genius. Are you Syd Barrett?'</p> <p>'Leave me alone. I've got to get some coleslaw.'</p> <p>I take this as a no.</p> <p>For a brief, glittering moment, Barrett (real name: Roger) was one of psychedelia's most productive, kaleidoscopic minds. But at some point between 1967 and 1969 something (some say acid, some say Mandrax, some say sherbet lemons) went very badly wrong. He left Pink Floyd, the band he founded, in April 1969 after his fellow musicians ran out of patience with his propensity for massaging Brylcreem into his hair, and his decreasing ability to communicate or perform. He released two solo albums, The Madcap Laughs and Barrett, both in 1970, then retreated to the cellar of his mother's house in Cambridge.</p> <p>For sheer cult recluse intrigue, his only living competitors are Sly Stone and Brian Wilson - both of whom also had breakdowns in rock's big breakdown era (1967-75) but neither of whom has shown the self-discipline of the bona fide hermit. No living musician generates so many rumours. Syd is married. Syd hangs around in my local pub. Syd has secret parties with Brian Eno and Jimmy Page. Syd hasn't seen daylight for 30 years. Syd is a painter, a gardener. Syd still thinks he's leader of Pink Floyd. Syd is diabetic. Syd is in Coldplay. All or none might be true, apart from the last.</p> <p>I'm not the first to go snooping for Syd. Between my trip to Cambridge and the completion of this piece, the Mail On Sunday publish a new snap of Barrett. But Barrett remains silent.</p> <p>Even his former bandmates seem to be in the dark. 'Over the years vague bits of information would filter back to me via my mum, who still lives in Cambridge - that Syd had moved house, or that he had moved back in with his mum, or that he was in the local sanatorium,' says ex-Floyd bassist Roger Waters. 'But I haven't actually spoken to him since 1975 when he came to one of our recording sessions uninvited.'</p> <p>Did he look different? 'None of us recognised him. He'd put on about four stone, shaved off all his body hair, and he was eating a big bag of sweets. He'd changed from this beautiful curly haired youth into something resembling the bloke who keeps the scores on that Vic Reeves show.'</p> <p>I tell Waters about a website that has an interview with Syd's nephew Ian, who says Syd 'still talks in fragments' and is uncomfortable about the past but that he's writing a book on art history. 'Really?'exclaims Waters, sounding thrilled. 'That's extraordinary. He must be a lot better. Maybe I will go and see him at some point.'</p> <p>'I think the Floyd have looked after him financially,' says Peter Jenner, ex-Floyd and Barrett manager. 'Dave [Gilmour] in a personable way and Roger in a conscience way. They've never denied their debt to Syd's original vision. But I'm sure they're all really pissed off by his continuing cool status.'</p> <p>Does it piss Waters off? 'Not at all,' Waters claims. 'But I remember seeing an early R.E.M. gig at the Hammersmith Odeon. I went backstage and they were all very warm and welcoming, apart from Michael Stipe who just sat in the corner with his back to me. Then he went on for the encore and did an a cappella version of [Syd's] 'Black Globe', which might have been his way of saying, \"Syd was all right but you're an arsehole.\"'</p> <p>What really seems to intrigue Waters and Jenner, like everyone else, is whether Barrett is aware of the vast cult acclaim he commands. They both talk of him turning up to Floyd events long after his departure and referring to them as 'his band'. But his nephew claims 'any talk of the past upsets him'. Is Barrett aware that modern rock bands (The Gigolo Aunts, Baby Lemonade) name themselves after his songs? That no album by any vaguely tortured, eccentric songwriter is reviewed without a reference to his own debut?</p> <p>Barrett's actual output is far outweighed by his aura, his musical history interesting but nowhere near as interesting as the blanks we fill in ourselves. His Floyd period brilliance - 'See Emily Play', 'Interstellar Overdrive' - is fleeting and tinged with the promise of better musicianship to come. His solo work is sparse, as grating as it is highfalutin. ('It was like seeing a bus coming out of the fog, then immediately seeing it disappear back into the fog again,' remembers Jenner.) There are glimpses of brilliance everywhere, then Barrett is gone - forever, before anything has the chance to be packaged. Is this why we can't leave him alone?</p> <p>It's not too hard to find Syd, if you ask a friend of a friend. Someone who knows someone who knows someone I know claims to have once arranged an interview over the phone on behalf of a Cambridge student paper, then turned up, only for Syd to greet his questions with silence and stare right through him.</p> <p>'You hear all sorts of stories,' says Max Rees, proprietor of Hot Numbers record shop in Cambridge. Who from? 'Oh - people. People in bands. People who know people.' Max directs me to the Mill Pond, a grassy area near King's and Queens' Colleges, where Syd hung out in the Sixties, and, according to Max's source, 'still goes for picnics'.</p> <p>But, in the end, for all my complaints about armies of Sydalikes, I walk around Cambridge terrified at the prospect of finding him. A group of students claim to have a friend who's seen him in the pub near their halls of residence. The assistants in the independently owned record shops I visit speak of Syd proudly, but have no first-hand evidence of his existence. I approach another big wandering bald man: he mumbles violently about fish.</p> <p>I finish the day beside the Mill Pond, not so much scanning for Syd as putting myself in his shoes: I am 55. I am perhaps the one genuinely untainted living cult rock star in a tainted world. I have enough royalties to spend afternoons watching scantily-clad students having picnics. I live in a beautiful, cultured city where no one recognises me. I don't have my looks any more, but my public do.</p> <p>I click out of the reverie, and think of something Jenner said: 'I can't help feeling Syd sussed it all out and said let's leave it, my work's done. He's never done tacky reunion tours. He's got the status of someone who died young. You wonder whether he knows exactly what he is doing... and I have a sneaky feeling he might.' The Real Syd Barrett could be laughing at us as we speak.</p> <p>The Best of Syd Barrett: Wouldn't You Miss Me is out now on EMI</p>",

      "body": "<p>Dress-down Friday has not worked out. In fact, it is about to be let go. A slew of new surveys from the States shows employers increasingly concerned that staff who turn up in 'smart casual' (or should that be 'casual smart'?) are up to 50 per cent more likely to act rude and silly. </p> <p>Lateness, sluggishness or just not being there at all have all become hallmarks of the last day of the working week, according to a study for American Corporate Trends Magazine. So much so, that many bosses are now returning Friday to its previous strict and sober incarnation. They include George W. Bush, who has decreed that henceforth all White House staff must be formally suited and booted whenever they report for work. And in Britain the Institute of Directors has also detected signs of an end to the recent custom of greeting the weekend one day early with a sludgy medley of soft trousers and endless, endless fleeces. </p> <p>Friday first went casual in Britain in the late 1980s, but the practice didn't really catch fire until the mid-Nineties. By then, the economy was booming and new sources of income and prestige - IT, biotechnology, dotcom - were emerging. The people who worked for these firms may have been rich (in fact, they were getting richer all the time), but they liked to think that they were sufficiently self-confident not to need to rely on someone else's idea of a status symbol. Bowler hats and umbrellas represented an older - now ailing - economy, one that had been founded aeons ago in the mid-nineteenth century on a formal distinction between work and home. </p> <p>The New Economy, by contrast, liked to emphasise the continuity and even overlap between professional and domestic spaces. People brought scented candles to the office before returning home to a converted industrial site. In Frankfurt, workers could pop into 'nap rooms' after lunch, while in London the smartest new nightclub was called, quite simply, 'Home'. At the level of aesthetics, work and play had become infinitely swappable. </p> <p>By the time the Millennium finally arrived, many firms, including the formerly pinstriped Merrill Lynch and Arthur Andersen, had decided to extend dress-down Friday to the other four days of the week. There were rules, of course - there always are. No jeans, naturally, and some other less obvious demarcations: shirts needed to have collars, and shoes laces. In America, apparently, staff had to be reminded to wear underwear, but that never seems to have been a problem in EC4 where it is always rather cold. </p> <p>What has been a problem, though, for a lot of people is achieving the required look. 'I can never remember if I'm supposed to be going for smart casual or casual smart,' complains one Merrill Lynch employee, who has given up pondering the distinction and taken refuge in ubiquitous chinos. While American and French men have long had an alternative uniform to the business suit - polo shirt, unstructured jacket, brownish/fawn trousers - British men have mostly had to resort to that odd solution of teaming a formal, usually Harris tweed, jacket with jeans. </p> <p>Several retailers have taken pity on the hordes of baffled men who arrive for work in the financial institutions of Canary Wharf each day knowing that they don't want to dress like Jeremy Clarkson but aren't quite sure who they do want to look like. Both Gap and Ted Baker have set up branches stuffed full of the kind of touchy-feely clobber that will take you inconspicuously through the day in a symphony of mushroom. </p> <p>What is odd is the complaint by one third of employers polled in New York last year that dress-down Friday has led to a huge increase in flirtatiousness among their staff. There surely can be nothing less erotic than men and women swaddled alike in baggy fleeces and comfy cords. 'I sometimes feel as if I'm working in an office staffed by expensive teddy bears,' reports one female bank worker who looks back with fondness to the days of crisp suiting. She's right, of course. </p> <p>Formal business wear is designed to give the illusion of sharp lines where none really exist. Waists are clinched, shoulders padded, large bottoms mercifully covered. In the case of men, the tie points urgently towards the genital area while, with women, obligatory skirts mean that legs are always on show. It's no surprise that a recent survey of more than 2,000 office workers carried out for Mills &amp; Boon showed that a third of us, male and female, like to fantasise about the object of our office affections wearing a nice smart suit. </p> <p>Dressing down has proved to be more of a worry, than getting decked out in a uniform ever was. Even in those companies that are casual every day, the understanding is that you wear a suit whenever appropriate - to meet a client, make an important presentation. </p> <p>'As a result I spend more time matching up my clothes to my schedule than I ever did before,' says Sarah Smart, who works for a Swiss bank. </p> <p>And, if America is anything to go by, the sartorial week is about to get even more complicated. To counter the negative effects of dress-down Fridays, some firms have instituted the weird corrective of Dress Up Thursdays. Soon, it seems, each day of the week could carry its own coercive dress code. </p> <p>Where dress-down Friday got it wrong was not in overestimating the importance of clothing upon our psyches, but in underplaying it. Employers had the vague hope that allowing people to wear buff-coloured trousers to the office would signal a loosening up of mental boundaries which, in turn, would release a stream of 'beyond the box' thinking. </p> <p>But clothing acts like a sharp trigger for sense memory. Wear casual clothes to work, and your brain thinks it's on holiday. It doesn't want to come up with left-field solutions to the problems in Product Development. Instead it makes you want to gossip with your friends, drink coffee, send loads of raffish emails and, if you can bear to fumble through all those layers of fleece, have sex with the person sitting next to you. </p> <p>Asking people to pretend that work is fun, and then suggesting that they mark this state of affairs by wearing combat trousers, is the height of patronisation. As the economy slows down and recession begins to bite, these kinds of self-deceiving strategies are beginning to fall away. We know what work owes us - money, skills-training and a certain amount of status. It doesn't own our souls, and we wouldn't want it to. For that we have home, where we can dress exactly as we please.</p>",

Formal business wear is designed to give the illusion of sharp lines where none really exist. Waists are clinched, shoulders padded, large bottoms mercifully covered. In the case of men, the tie points urgently towards the genital area while, with women, obligatory skirts mean that legs are always on show. It's no surprise that a recent survey of more than 2,000 office workers carried out for Mills &amp; Boon showed that a third of us, male and female, like to fantasise about the object of our office affections wearing a nice smart suit. Dressing down has proved to be more of a worry, than getting decked out in a uniform ever was. Even in those companies that are casual every day, the understanding is that you wear a suit whenever appropriate - to meet a client, make an important presentation. 'As a result I spend more time matching up my clothes to my schedule than I ever did before,' says Sarah Smart, who works for a Swiss bank. And, if America is anything to go by, the sartorial week is about to get even more complicated. To counter the negative effects of dress-down Fridays, some firms have instituted the weird corrective of Dress Up Thursdays. Soon, it seems, each day of the week could carry its own coercive dress code. Where dress-down Friday got it wrong was not in overestimating the importance of clothing upon our psyches, but in underplaying it. Employers had the vague hope that allowing people to wear buff-coloured trousers to the office would signal a loosening up of mental boundaries which, in turn, would release a stream of 'beyond the box' thinking. But clothing acts like a sharp trigger for sense memory. Wear casual clothes to work, and your brain thinks it's on holiday. It doesn't want to come up with left-field solutions to the problems in Product Development. Instead it makes you want to gossip with your friends, drink coffee, send loads of raffish emails and, if you can bear to fumble through all those layers of fleece, have sex with the person sitting next to you. Asking people to pretend that work is fun, and then suggesting that they mark this state of affairs by wearing combat trousers, is the height of patronisation. As the economy slows down and recession begins to bite, these kinds of self-deceiving strategies are beginning to fall away. We know what work owes us - money, skills-training and a certain amount of status. It doesn't own our souls, and we wouldn't want it to. For that we have home, where we can dress exactly as we please.",

With a ratty wig on her severed head, her eye sockets hollow and mouth (equipped with a full set of choppers) grinning lewdly, the mummified crone presides over this superb exhibition. The matriarch's pickled head has replaced the skull of Yorick as our emblem of mortality and its jesting triumph. I felt more moved by her wizened, discoloured face than I did when I first saw the Mona Lisa. </p> <p>The countries in which Hitchcock lived and worked did little to honour him during his centenary in 1999: England's tribute consisted of a vapidly trendy show at the Oxford Museum of Modern Art, and Moma in New York managed only a paltry display of posters. </p> <p>Two years later, his Francophone admirers have apotheosised him. It was French critics who first acclaimed him as a tragic metaphysician in the 1950s, when the English-speaking world still considered him to be no more than a shrewd commercial operator, and it is French art historians and cinephiles who now establish him as one of the indispensable modern masters - a creator of form, as Chabrol and Rohmer called him, who altered the way we see the world; a po\u00e8te maudit who infected so many of us, as Truffaut put it, with his private disquiets; a dictator of dreams who, as Godard claimed, succeeded where Caesar and Napoleon failed, and took control of the entire universe. </p> <p>As if proving Godard's point, a collection of souvenirs testifies to Hitchcock's global reach, his endless capacity for metamorphosis and his intimate invasion of our privacy. The curators have rounded up Hitchcock stamps from Sierra Leone, an ad for beer in which a puddle of froth distends into his bulbous profile, and bars of soap or towels imprinted with the black motto of the Bates Motel. Whether edging nervously up staircases or shiftily handling a pair of scissors, we all live inside Hitchcock's haunted head. </p> <p>The exhibition begins in a dark room where, fumbling through shadows, we discover 21 mundane but mortal objects, displayed in glass cases on folds of blood-red cloth. This is a Hitchcockian reliquary, a gathering of props sanctified by their association with death; Bernard Herrmann's funereal score for the scene at the Mission Dolores in Vertigo announces that we are on holy ground. Among the curios are the gleaming razor from Spellbound, the breadknife from Blackmail, the glass of possibly poisoned milk from Suspicion and the tell-tale cigarette lighter from Strangers on a Train. Here too are some of the director's profaner fetishes: the puckered skin of the handbag with its vaginal clasp of cold brass from Marnie, the doll with the bleeding groin from Stage Fright, the phallic telephoto lens from Rear Window, and the silk stockings twined round handcuffs which unite the fugitive couple in The 39 Steps. </p> <p>Finally, we are released into daylight after sidling past a jungle gym infested with broody crows. The school playground from The Birds reminds us of the innocence which Hitchcock's imagination so cruelly despoils. </p> <p>The 'fatal coincidences' to which the show refers represent moments when Hitchcock's films intersect with the history of art. This is his official admission to the culture enshrined by museums - if you like, his canonisation. 'Hitchcock was above all an Englishman,' says a wall text (in French, ironically), and the show traces his obsessive images back to the morbid romanticism of the Victorians. A Burne-Jones print hangs on the wall of the suspected serial killer in The Lodger, and serves as a photofit image of his preferred blonde victims. Ingrid Bergman's adored profile in Under Capricorn exactly matches the domestic Madonnas photographed by Julia Margaret Cameron. Kim Novak afloat in San Francisco bay in Vertigo resembles the drowning Ophelia of the pre-Raphaelite Millais; duplicated by the double role she plays as both soulful angel and earthly demon, Novak also eerily corresponds to Rossetti's Rosa Triplex. Hitchcock, who attended art history courses at night school during his early years in London, saw the motion picture as a paint ing freakishly animated. </p> <p>An anguished Christ painted by Rouault is juxtaposed with close-ups of an excruciated Henry Fonda in The Wrong Man. More riskily, the exhibition proceeds to uncover a traditional religious iconography in profaner contexts: the harried pursuit of Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint through a birch forest in North By Northwest recalls the expulsion of Adam and Eve from Eden, as if painted by a latter-day Mantegna. </p> <p>The exhibition calls teasing attention to its own comparative method in a section where sequences from Hitchcock's films are screened beside parallel passages from other directors. 'Homage? Citation? Competition? Source?' asks the title cards, as we watch the Psycho shower scene next to a bath-tub murder from Fritz Lang's While the City Sleeps, or the belltower finale from Vertigo intercut with an equivalent episode from Bu\u00f1uel's El. The coincidences don't damage Hitchcock's originality, because they show him taking expressionistic or surrealistic fantasies and grounding them in realism. The incineration of Valhalla in Lang's Nibelungen saga becomes the torching of Manderley in Rebecca; a car radio which broadcasts from the nether world in Cocteau's Orph\u00e9e is switched on again - more scarily because more plausibly - in The Birds, and the same ethereal voice announces doomsday. </p> <p>Continuing what the curator Guy Cogeval calls Hitchcock's 'adventure through modern art', the exhibition aligns him with a succession of audacious avant-gardes. The dream Dali designed for Spellbound is reconstructed, with Ingrid Bergman (in footage junked by the producer Selznick) calcifying into a columnar white goddess who sports a spiky dog collar.

In conclusion, the show boldly abstracts Hitchcock, claiming he shared Duchamp's devious talent for unsettling our confidence in reality.

And out of Britain's industrial past come clowns. </p> <p>And a distinct sensation on the stage. Outside Britain, the new kinds of circus, which eschew baleful lions, glittering corselettes and pee-stained sawdust, established their identities years ago. The French-based Archaos have staged mock-bullfights with a driverless taxi (the beast was finally stabbed with a sink plunger), while the Argentinian De la Guarda have hung over the heads of audiences from rock-climbing ropes, flying to the accompaniment of chants, drummings and rain-forest sounds. Now there's a particularly British breed. </p> <p>Mark Fisher, the creative director of The Millennium Show in the Dome, who has designed shows for Pink Floyd, U2 and the Rolling Stones, has joined forces with Pierrot Bidon from Archaos and four prominent Dome performers to produce <strong> Storm</strong>. Staged in a tent, with the audience standing, Storm features trapeze artists, dancers, singers, rope-climbers, clarinettists, tightrope-walkers, mimes, acrobats and jokers. They do turns, they amaze; they are the circus, but not quite as we know it. The surprise ingredient is a continuous narrative: Storm is an aerial portrait of a day in the city. </p> <p>Everything takes place over the audience's heads. In the opening moments, while a speeded-up video of circus feats whirs against one wall, a high walkway running round the building is filled with urgent figures, leaping and leaning together in a rush-hour dance; a radio DJ, a latterday ringmaster, raps out early-morning news. </p> <p>Things get stranger. A young woman, dressed for a day out, tightropes her way across the tent to buy a bunch of flowers; a lollipop lady, looking like a giant Marigold glove in her bright yellow mac, whooshes from the ceiling on a trapeze. Huge shadows of rotating wheels sweep across the walls and the audience. The air up there is suddenly crammed with multiple aerialists, swinging over you and past each other. </p> <p>Individual stories develop, made more singular by being executed in everyday clothes rather than circus costumes. A girl gets off with a postman (their romance is enacted in a series of acrobatic leaps and holds), while a couple pursue each other up and down a rope - sex on a flex. Most spectacularly, though too late in the evening, is the whirling, crashing, body-flinging storm itself. </p> <p>What does it amount to? It's spectacular, sensational and arresting. This doesn't mean it's empty. You couldn't call Storm a play. You couldn't say the narrative is as yet strong - or clear - enough to take command of a series of terrific, skilful moments. You couldn't say it creates characters: no one having seen this is going to press for a juggling Hedda Gabler or a tightrope- walking King Lear. Nevertheless, each act and movement is full of personality and full of interest about the way people betray themselves through movement. Together, they provide a dynamic, wraparound experience of city terrors. </p> <p>Sex in the city, along with date rape, is one of the clear modern signals in Tim Supple's production of William Wycherley's <strong> Love in a Wood</strong>, first performed in 1671. Throughout the evening, there are finely pointed moments when this production seems about to take off. But it never quite does. </p> <p>It always looks wonderful. The set, devised by Supple and Sue Wilmington, is almost bare and continuously twilit. With its pools of candlelight, its spookily masked figures, its huge, shadowy recesses, this is a design which freely declares its darkness. It seems to promise comedy as a reluctant byproduct of its satire's chief targets - secrecy, jealousy and male complacency. </p> <p>It's an intelligent reading of a play so furrowed and furbelowed in plot and language that it's hard to tease out a main thread. But it's not followed through with sufficient rigour. The cast is caught between two possible renderings of Wycherley's ornate speech: the members could deliver it as a series of rounded witticisms, with a cocked eyebrow at the end of each line; they could consider it, however complicated, as delivering a truth - perhaps not simple, but sometimes intimate. No one's decided which course to take: too often actors gulp in the middle of a line as if to find a bit of time for reflection. They're not quite funny and not quite scathing enough. It's an intriguing but not a buoyant revival. </p> <p>'Black Label' takes on a new significance in <strong> Suip!</strong>, a history of South Africa as seen through the bottle. 'Suip', which means 'to drink [mainly alcohol] in excess', is only one of the Afrikaans words you'll learn as an English speaker coming to this show: another is 'jas' - 'horny, out of your mind'. </p> <p>But no one will need any instruction in the basic grammar of what's being danced and sung and snarled. This is a story about human beings being turned into brutes by booze and by people selling the booze. </p> <p>The good thing is it's told, melodiously but hopelessly, by the brutes: homeless, pissing-in-their-own-beer, horrible, talented, mercurial slouchers. Nothing nice here, but nothing phoney either.</p>",

With its pools of candlelight, its spookily masked figures, its huge, shadowy recesses, this is a design which freely declares its darkness. It seems to promise comedy as a reluctant byproduct of its satire's chief targets - secrecy, jealousy and male complacency. It's an intelligent reading of a play so furrowed and furbelowed in plot and language that it's hard to tease out a main thread. But it's not followed through with sufficient rigour. The cast is caught between two possible renderings of Wycherley's ornate speech: the members could deliver it as a series of rounded witticisms, with a cocked eyebrow at the end of each line; they could consider it, however complicated, as delivering a truth - perhaps not simple, but sometimes intimate. No one's decided which course to take: too often actors gulp in the middle of a line as if to find a bit of time for reflection. They're not quite funny and not quite scathing enough. It's an intriguing but not a buoyant revival. 'Black Label' takes on a new significance in Suip!, a history of South Africa as seen through the bottle. 'Suip', which means 'to drink [mainly alcohol] in excess', is only one of the Afrikaans words you'll learn as an English speaker coming to this show: another is 'jas' - 'horny, out of your mind'. But no one will need any instruction in the basic grammar of what's being danced and sung and snarled. This is a story about human beings being turned into brutes by booze and by people selling the booze. The good thing is it's told, melodiously but hopelessly, by the brutes: homeless, pissing-in-their-own-beer, horrible, talented, mercurial slouchers. Nothing nice here, but nothing phoney either.",

This annual report on the great and the good, as well as the merely famous, is known as the VF Hall of Fame. But nobody is fooled for a second - the honour isn't in the gift of the magazine.

One answer is that she appears to let them call the shots, to organise their own formal portraits, accompanied by appropriate professional props. So Madeleine Albright ends an important call in her Washington stateroom, caressed by the golden glow of Chinoiserie lamps. Alexandra von Furstenberg models one of her company's exorbitant gowns. Katherine Graham dominates the deserted offices of her very own Washington Post. </p> <p>These are the definitive, conservative images that might appear on the jacket of some future biography or on the ballroom piano, among a forest of silver frames. But Leibovitz is far better known for more theatrical scenarios - Arnold Schwarzenegger mastering one of his thoroughbreds, his bare torso oiled to a glint; Whoopi Goldberg bathing in asses' milk; Bette Midler breasting a tide of roses. These scenarios are created in much the same conditions as a Hollywood production - teams of assistants, banks of lights, journalists filing location reports as the budget soars by the hour. </p> <p>But are these images any more eloquent, any less like blatant advertising, than a shot of Albright enthroned in power? What, if anything, do they have to say about the relationship between artist and subject? </p> <p>'A photograph is not an opinion. Or is it?' asks Susan Sontag in her introduction to Women, lightly trailing the idea that Leibovitz might have some subtle opinions of her own. If only these were discernible in her portraits, which seem to me to be drastically neutral, all the energy squandered on casting and blocking an elaborate tableau to boost the sitter's public prestige, none left for the inner being. </p> <p>Leibovitz doesn't attempt to interrogate her sitters any more than they are prepared to disclose themselves to her camera. The result is a polite social contract in which neither side gives anything away, other than a general willingness to broker another image against the depredations of mortality. </p> <p>So it is always good to see Leibovitz's fine off-duty photographs, when she isn't working for the advertising or entertainment industries - grave, early shots of her family and friends, occasional landscapes and nudes. </p> <p>For the last decade, she has been photographing female nudes at her studio in upstate New York and they seem a million miles from her Californian superstars. Spectral, silent, suspended in a blue-green aqueous light, they look like sea creatures submerged at the bottom of the ocean. Each figure holds a still, quasi-classical pose against an invisible current. The poise is graceful and fully professional, for these women are mainly dancers. </p> <p>Bodies spiral up into monolithic columns, tense their long muscles and settle like reclining odalisques. There are landscapes - haunches like undulating hills, and abstracts, as the flexed torso becomes an indecipherably mysterious expanse. Leibovitz has printed the images on costly cartridge paper, to get the beautiful softness of dispersing watercolour. The scale may be heroic - a hand, cradled between the breasts, is three times larger than life - but no picture is bigger than an easel painting. Which is as it should be, for these photographs are closely linked to that older tradition of art. </p> <p>Each image alludes to a more historic nude - a Greek statue, an Ingres odalisque, The Rokeby Venus, even one of Magritte's double-take canvases. But Leibovitz runs a subtle commentary through these allusions, suggesting, for example, that the corpse in Rembrandt's Anatomy Lesson of Dr Tulp is as much a nude as any classical sculpture; or that the power of Soutine's flayed carcasses, surrogates of human vulnerability, depends in part on their naked condition. </p> <p>Leibovitz's nudes may sound regressive, a return to the painterly photographs of Edward Steichen, circa 1900, in their craving for the perfect palette and tone. But they have more to say about painting - and about the conventions of photography.

      "body": "<p><strong> Duo:logue</strong> Linbury Studio Theatre, ROH, London WC2 </p> <p>A beansprout of a leg gleams in the darkness, extending itself towards a light source high in the flies. It could be the antenna of some mutant creature until its owner is revealed as Edward Watson, whose six o'clock arabesque almost rivals Sylvie Guillem's. </p> <p>In <strong>Duo:logue</strong>, Wayne McGregor's programme for the Royal Ballet and his company, Random, dancers are fantastic beings. He presents them as contradictions: sexy yet genderless; anonymous and entirely individual. In his creations for Random, he uses digital technology and laser lighting to make flesh and blood seem as insubstantial as computer animations. Here, he lets his performers create their own illusions through the speed and skill with which they move. </p> <p>The triple bill is a dialogue between ballet and contemporary dancers, brought together by the Artists' Development Initiative programme at the Royal Opera House. McGregor started out last year with seven volunteers from the Royal Ballet, led by ADI's director, Deborah Bull. Their joint choreographic sketches, pulled together as Symbiont(s), first appeared in the Clore Studio Upstairs. Repeated downstairs in the Linbury as the opening section of the evening, the reworked piece has greater coherence. </p> <p>There are astonishing solos, revealing how well McGregor and the Royal Ballet dancers have understood each other. Watson has a feral elegance as he skies those tendril legs, Bull is naughtily insolent, Jenny Tattersall skitters around like an imp on speed. </p> <p>The central pas de deux for Bull and Watson is a push-me-pull-you challenge, endearingly ungainly. McGregor's inexperience in dealing with lifts is evident - the dancer in the air looks good, while the handler lurches like Obelix with his menhir. </p> <p>Symbiont(s) has rough edges, for all its performers' slickness.

      "bodyText": "Duo:logue Linbury Studio Theatre, ROH, London WC2 A beansprout of a leg gleams in the darkness, extending itself towards a light source high in the flies. It could be the antenna of some mutant creature until its owner is revealed as Edward Watson, whose six o'clock arabesque almost rivals Sylvie Guillem's. In Duo:logue, Wayne McGregor's programme for the Royal Ballet and his company, Random, dancers are fantastic beings. He presents them as contradictions: sexy yet genderless; anonymous and entirely individual. In his creations for Random, he uses digital technology and laser lighting to make flesh and blood seem as insubstantial as computer animations. Here, he lets his performers create their own illusions through the speed and skill with which they move. The triple bill is a dialogue between ballet and contemporary dancers, brought together by the Artists' Development Initiative programme at the Royal Opera House. McGregor started out last year with seven volunteers from the Royal Ballet, led by ADI's director, Deborah Bull. Their joint choreographic sketches, pulled together as Symbiont(s), first appeared in the Clore Studio Upstairs. Repeated downstairs in the Linbury as the opening section of the evening, the reworked piece has greater coherence. There are astonishing solos, revealing how well McGregor and the Royal Ballet dancers have understood each other. Watson has a feral elegance as he skies those tendril legs, Bull is naughtily insolent, Jenny Tattersall skitters around like an imp on speed. The central pas de deux for Bull and Watson is a push-me-pull-you challenge, endearingly ungainly. McGregor's inexperience in dealing with lifts is evident - the dancer in the air looks good, while the handler lurches like Obelix with his menhir. Symbiont(s) has rough edges, for all its performers' slickness. The choreographic writing isn't joined up: the pas de deux is in capital letters, other fragments in unfinished paragraphs. Lucy Carter's lighting flicks between corps and soloists as though she and McGregor are switching between files on a word-processor: let's have a look at that; remember that bit?; how about this? Next comes Aeon, the finale of McGregor's millennarian trilogy for his own company. In that context, it is the synthesis of the preceding works, a pure dance celebration to an outpouring of baroque music by Marin Marais. Placed here, Aeon is the antithesis of Symbiont(s). Random's dancers are less showy than the Royal's, more like unself-conscious children at play. They tumble fluently through space, impelled by the manic bowing of the string quartet. When they combine at the end, they couldn't be less like a corps de ballet. Sleek as seals in shimmering leotards, they remain resolutely themselves. When the two groups combine for brainstate , their differences are all the more obvious for being played down. Costumed by Ben Maher, everyone looks eerily alike, with no distinction between the sexes. At the start, a gang of men could be women, strutting in stiff-legged poses. Yet when the women do the same thing, their body language is entirely other. It is fascinating to see how the Royal Ballet dancers can fuse, when they choose, into a unit; a star soloist, however, knows how to attract attention away from the troops in a way the Random lot never do.

Unencumbered by the cast of peripheral 'regulars' necessary to plump the show into sitcom format, but entirely unnecessary to the appeal of the central character, the Pub Landlord returns Murray to form in a new, two-hour show which demonstrates his superlative skill in blending improvisation with prepared anecdote so slickly it's impossible to see the seams. </p> <p>The Pub Landlord's essentials haven't changed since his origins in Harry Hill's Edinburgh show Pub Internationale, which brought the first Perrier nomination in 1994. All the old riffs echo through the new show - the fierce demagoguery, the neck tics, the unshakable, misplaced pride in his own version of the British Empire, the hatred of all things French and the prurient homophobia - but rather than going for the guaranteed laugh, Murray rations the catchphrases to his fans like sweets to children so they don't get sick of them. </p> <p>Murray, 32, has always excelled at the confident, off-the-cuff repartee that delights live audiences. The Pub Landlord's endearing bigotry is engineered to exactly this kind of comedy, which was the most obvious weakness in translating the character to television. The reliance on improvised banter, however, must have worked in Murray's favour after the computer containing all the material for this show was stolen from his house last month, leading to a near-cancellation and the rapid rewriting from memory in five weeks of an act that would usually require a year to prepare. </p> <p>Not that you'd know any of this from the polished professionalism of the delivery. From the moment he steps on to the stage under the shadow of a giant heraldic crest bearing the motto 'Pint for the Fella, Glass of White Wine for the Lady', Murray's speed of thought is stunning. Even an early hiccup with the lighting, which left him stranded in eerie gloom for the first five minutes, was cheerfully acknowledged and dismissed with 'Ah, you found that 50p then, Tony,' when the technicians solved the problem. </p> <p>Anyone in the first two rows has, knowingly or otherwise, signed up as part of the show, and the audience didn't let him down. Who would imagine so many laughs could be extracted so effortlessly from saying 'Martin' repeatedly in a silly voice? And, given the Pub Landlord's opinion of computers, don't sit within his line of sight if you work in IT, unless you want 600 people to go home remembering you as the bloke whose thrills are found in looking for an elf behind a wall. </p> <p>So sharp are Murray's responses to whatever his audience throws at him that anyone who hasn't seen him live could be forgiven for thinking at first that he's set plants in the front row, but after a few minutes he pulls a fast one and leaves the stage for the rest of the first half to his support, Jason Freeman. (This is a sneaky trick being employed increasingly by comics and bands alike to get round the perennial problem of the audience remaining steadfastly in the bar throughout the support act - Eminem did it recently.) Freeman, who appears in Time, Gentlemen, Please and has previously worked with Richard Herring, Jenny Eclair and Simon Munnery, works hard at the unenviable task of entertaining an audience who hadn't come to see him and wouldn't remotely have cared if he hadn't been there, but the volume of the laughter plummeted. This was in spite of an energetic delivery and a few one-liners that hit the target, but his slot was just that bit too long to sustain an audience keen to get back to the Pub Landlord. </p> <p>Murray's uninterrupted, full-throttle second half was a showcase of ruthless stand-up brilliance, keeping the audience closely involved in more convoluted, topical anecdotes and philosophical meanderings with so many quickfire lines - taking you by surprise and making you spray beer over the row in front - that it's impossible to quote them singly. </p> <p>This kind of improvised comedy requires the co-operation of a politely respectful audience, which is the main difficulty with Baddiel and Skinner moving their <strong> Unplanned</strong> show from television to the Shaftesbury Theatre. While Murray has his character as a buffer zone, Baddiel and Skinner are so well-known as themselves that it's easy to feel you know them as mates and are not really at the theatre at all. The opening night demonstrated the catch-22 of improvised comedy: you want your audience to be uninhibited enough to join in, but not so much that they want to get on stage and be funnier than you. </p> <p>The show follows exactly the format of the television series, but without the intervention of the ITV swearing tsars. Left to their own devices, Baddiel and Skinner flashed the witty feed-and-response that made the television show original, but the audience wanted knob gags and after a brave attempt to make a joke that demanded a rudimentary historical knowledge, they gave up and plunged straight down to where the ready laughs could be found. </p> <p>Of course, no one would go to this show expecting Stoppardian dialogue, and the problem is not in the content - it's what you expect from professional lads making jokes for other lads, and often funny in spite of that - but in the venue. Everyone wanted to be heard, and the theatre is too big for the performers to be aware of what's happening beyond the first few rows of the stalls, but this didn't stop the enthusiastic hecklers at the back.

      "body": "<p>It was a good job I went on the bus and not in the car. I could barely walk in a straight line after our first session, let alone see straight. One eye refused to focus. I floated down the road to a coffee bar and ordered a strong one. I needed two.</p> <p>So that was how it felt to be hypnotised - profoundly relaxed, no sense of time passing, my weight sinking into the therapist's couch, his voice gently intoning behind me, rather like when you know you are about to doze off on the sofa in front of the TV. Yet somehow I knew that I would be able to get up if I wanted to.</p> <p>It is not far as the crow flies from Terry Morris's cosy little consulting room in Shoreditch to the department of reproductive medicine at University College Hospital in Bloomsbury, but the intuitive, therapeutic world of hypnotherapy and the rigours of conventional medicine couldn't be farther apart. I was visiting both for the same reason, however: to help me have another baby.</p> <p>After my first successful pregnancy I had miscarried within the first 12 weeks three times in four years. Although miscarriage is probably the most common cause of young women being admitted to hospital apart from having a baby, and it is estimated that a quarter of all conceptions end this way, the chances of it happening again and again are much smaller. Only 1 per cent of women lose three consecutive pregnancies. About a third of those aged under 40 will have a successful pregnancy eventually.</p> <p>Fifty per cent of these recurrent miscarriages are unexplained. My age certainly increased the odds of genetic abnormalities in the foetus causing the losses, but I had our first child at 40 and the pregnancy had been completely trouble-free. Blood tests showed my blood wasn't prone to clotting, which can affect the supply to the placenta; my hormone levels were normal, and there was no sign of an autoimmune disease such as lupus, which can cause miscarriage.

      "bodyText": "It was a good job I went on the bus and not in the car. I could barely walk in a straight line after our first session, let alone see straight. One eye refused to focus. I floated down the road to a coffee bar and ordered a strong one. I needed two. So that was how it felt to be hypnotised - profoundly relaxed, no sense of time passing, my weight sinking into the therapist's couch, his voice gently intoning behind me, rather like when you know you are about to doze off on the sofa in front of the TV. Yet somehow I knew that I would be able to get up if I wanted to. It is not far as the crow flies from Terry Morris's cosy little consulting room in Shoreditch to the department of reproductive medicine at University College Hospital in Bloomsbury, but the intuitive, therapeutic world of hypnotherapy and the rigours of conventional medicine couldn't be farther apart. I was visiting both for the same reason, however: to help me have another baby. After my first successful pregnancy I had miscarried within the first 12 weeks three times in four years. Although miscarriage is probably the most common cause of young women being admitted to hospital apart from having a baby, and it is estimated that a quarter of all conceptions end this way, the chances of it happening again and again are much smaller. Only 1 per cent of women lose three consecutive pregnancies. About a third of those aged under 40 will have a successful pregnancy eventually. Fifty per cent of these recurrent miscarriages are unexplained. My age certainly increased the odds of genetic abnormalities in the foetus causing the losses, but I had our first child at 40 and the pregnancy had been completely trouble-free. Blood tests showed my blood wasn't prone to clotting, which can affect the supply to the placenta; my hormone levels were normal, and there was no sign of an autoimmune disease such as lupus, which can cause miscarriage. Karyotyping, a genetic test of both partners to determine individual chromosome patterns, suggested nothing unusual. Doctors who treat infertile couples say they are the only patients who are desperate for you to find something wrong with them. If you say everything is normal, they are distraught. Miscarriages create another set of problems. 'Anxiety about the outcome of your next pregnancy means there is a double burden to carry,' says Ruth Bender Atik, national director of the Miscarriage Association, a support group. 'You are worried that worry will make it worse. It helps to do something that makes you feel you have some sort of control - that you are doing everything you can to nurture your baby.'

      "body": "<p><strong> Ani DiFranco: </strong> I met Utah in Philadelphia at a folk festival about 10 years ago and, as is typical of folk-music operations, we were billeted at an acoustic music appreciator's house. I was 20, had a shaved head and I looked like a little punk, which is unusual on the folk scene, and they weren't comfortable with me, so I got an attitude. Then I walked into the kitchen, and there was Utah sitting there and he just cleared the air with his presence and his humour and I fell in love with him immediately. </p> <p>I was exposed to folk music when I was young, influenced by travelling folk singers who would stay with my family in Buffalo, New York. I'd long been aware of Utah as one of the most respected folk singers and storytellers in the country. As I got to know him, he took on a kind of mentor role. He has been a singer/storyteller for 30 years and I wanted to bring my audience, which is much younger than Utah's, to his work. </p> <p>One thing we really connect on is this wedding of political rage and humour and joy. He has the ability to sit onstage and start talking and get everybody loosened up and laughing, then bring home political points. I admire his ability to have strong convictions about pacifism (Utah was a soldier during the Korean War), unionism, anti-corporate politics, but also to be fun, and to approach people in an open way. </p> <p>We have collaborated on two albums. Our second project, Fellow Workers, was an eye opener for us because we were working side by side. He brings his persona off-stage, too - he's always performing, which can be tricky. It was my brainchild so I was directing it, but it's hard when you're 60-odd and you've perfected your craft, and then somebody says, 'Put down all your tools and do something different.' It wasn't easy for either of us, but I learned a lot about opening up to someone, trusting and relating on a more intuitive level. </p> <p>I'm based in Buffalo and Utah's in Nevada City, California, so he sends me cassette letters and we write. We tend to see each other now and again. I contacted Utah recently about doing a third record and he's up for it, so we'll see what happens! </p> <p> <strong> Utah Phillips: </strong> I hadn't been aware of Ani's work before meeting her, though she had released her first album the year before, but I remember thinking she had more energy than I'd ever seen in anyone, and I also realised that she had an extraordinarily powerful intellect. She'd found a recording of one of my performances, and she wrote to me, saying, 'I want my audience to hear your stories', which don't appear on my albums. So she asked me to send as many live tape recordings as I had, and she would do it all. She went into the studio and twisted everything around so it would fit for her audience. When it arrived in the mail, I was knocked out. A lot of my old folkies listened to it and didn't like it, because they didn't understand it, and I said, 'Tough luck, it wasn't made for you.' </p> <p>I most admire Ani's integrity. She's true to herself and her beliefs - her songs tackle issues such as violence against women, abortion and sexism. The minute she set up her own label, Righteous Babe Records, there was no question it would be profit sharing - the people in that office are like a family. Ani has now released 13 solo albums. </p> <p>What we do is cross-generational. After that first album, colleges would invite me to sing purely on the strength of the work I'd done with Ani. I was singing these old labour songs and all the young women were singing along - now, that's never happened to me before in my life. She led me towards that young audience and now I hang out with them a lot downtown. </p> <p>Perhaps the greatest honour for me was being invited to perform at Ani's wedding, at a lake north of Montreal. I was the minister - I'm a lay preacher for the Unitarian Universalists, and I do anarchist weddings. Sadly, I don't see her too much now because she's on the road for 300 days a year, and I've got congestive heart failure, so I can't travel. But we do write - she sent me a letter recently asking me if I'd like to do a third record. And if Ani wants me to do it, I'll do it. I've learned that I can trust her implicitly with anything.</p> <p>\u0095 Ani DiFranco's new album, Revelling/Reckoning, is out now.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Georgina Godley has one of those jobs you can't help but envy. She's in charge of accessories at Habitat, which means that anything other than furniture comes under her beady eye. She oversees the china and glassware, as well as the bedlinen and bathroom towels. Along with head of design Tom Dixon, and head of furniture Matthew Hilton, she forms one-third of the furniture chain's holy trinity, intent on keeping Habitat a step ahead. </p> <p>Godley trained as a fine artist at Brighton and Chelsea but eventually joined forces with a fellow student, Scott Crolla, in 1981, to open a shop specialising in baroque menswear. She first met Dixon in the mid-80s: 'Tom and I were involved in a nightclub together - The Titanic - and we put on a Day-Glo fashion show.' By the end of the 80s, Godley was doing her own thing with one-off sculptural fashion pieces. Now, as head of home accessories at Habitat, her life appears to have come full circle. Part of the new season's collection is a pink neon tray and a deckchair with a neon stripe, a throwback to the fashion of the mid-80s.</p> <p>She's quite proud of her new deckchairs. In a way, they are the perfect fusion of fashion and interiors; the idea is that you get a basic wooden frame and then choose a sling to go with it - from a traditional stripe to what Godley calls her sportswear sling, made out of nylon, with neon flash, and even drawstrings and toggles. Each summer, there will be new slings to update your chair.</p> <p>'I read an article about Terence Conran, when he said that he started Habitat as a furniture store, and home accessories was just styling that was put around the furniture,' she says. 'But the Habitat business grew in home accessories in a way that they had never anticipated. The accessories area is somewhere that one can do something much more fluid and spontaneous - you can restyle and refresh your home reasonably cheaply, and keep up to date with fashion. You can't be as flippant with furniture because you live with it.'</p> <p>Godley, who recently separated from the product designer Sebastian Conran has had plenty of time to understand the Habitat ethos. To be working for the company that her father-in-law founded in 1964 all seems very natural. 'A great privilege in many respects.' She recalls seeing Habitat product from the first time round in the various Conran homes: 'Still there in a kind of jaded glory. I feel that I completely absorbed the culture,' she says. 'I'm very committed and always was, from the time I was in fashion, to breaking down the elitist boundaries of design.'</p> <p>Her first memories of the store are as a child in Kingston in the 60s. 'There was nothing like it. It's very difficult to try to explain to young designers who don't remember it then what a powerful, revolutionary place it was. It would be a great achievement to try and build some of that electricity again in Habitat.'</p> <p>Since joining the company 18 months ago, Godley has been injecting some of her own electricity into everything from bath towels to dinner plates. As part of a 'techno-folk' theme, she has introduced a pixelated floral pattern for china, and has given a slightly vintage look to wine and Champagne glasses. And there's also the Blade Runner neon plastic trays. Her background in fashion is coming in very useful. 'I would say that home accessories and fashion move hand in hand. They follow the same trends. Much like the accessories market in fashion, there are people who would feel too compromised wearing the outfit but are very happy to carry the handbag or wear the shoes. That's very true of home accessories.' People are, perhaps, even more confident about introducing fashion to their homes than to their wardrobe. 'It really is as simple as some cushions and a new rug, and you've got a new living space. My grandmother used to have summer and winter curtains. We're not really far off from that happening again.'</p> <p>Georgina's own home, a stone's throw from Hampstead Heath, is still in the process of being dressed. She lives with her two sons in a pretty Victorian terrace. In the basement kitchen, there is a mix of clever junk shop finds and comfortable old friends. She has painted one wall with blackboard paint - the family uses it to keep a diary as well as reminders for the shopping list. At New Year, Godley and her friends wrote their resolutions on it. Upstairs, there is a long, narrow lounge, with cupboards built into the walls from floor to ceiling. There are also two distinctive pieces of Habitat furniture: the grey-felt daybed, usually covered in crumbs, bits of melted chocolate and Pikachu left by the kids and their friends, as well as a stunning, if difficult-to-clean, Perspex table called Slot, designed by Seng Watson.</p> <p>There is a larger, grander reception room on the first floor, which is in the process of having a luxurious leather floor laid. Lying on the floor is an electric-blue flocked chandelier. On the top floor is Godley's bedroom, with great views out on to the Heath. Behind her bed, she has installed a wall of sheepskin, a cosy contrast to the minimalism of the rest of the room.</p> <p>'Moving to this house was a brilliant way to understand Habitat. I had a relatively low budget and have had to turn it round quite quickly,' she says. 'It was interesting finding out what was available on the high street for immediate delivery.' Godley has found there is no such thing as instant gratification and has had to wait for delivery, just like everyone else.</p>",

She first met Dixon in the mid-80s: 'Tom and I were involved in a nightclub together - The Titanic - and we put on a Day-Glo fashion show.' By the end of the 80s, Godley was doing her own thing with one-off sculptural fashion pieces. Now, as head of home accessories at Habitat, her life appears to have come full circle. Part of the new season's collection is a pink neon tray and a deckchair with a neon stripe, a throwback to the fashion of the mid-80s. She's quite proud of her new deckchairs. In a way, they are the perfect fusion of fashion and interiors; the idea is that you get a basic wooden frame and then choose a sling to go with it - from a traditional stripe to what Godley calls her sportswear sling, made out of nylon, with neon flash, and even drawstrings and toggles. Each summer, there will be new slings to update your chair. 'I read an article about Terence Conran, when he said that he started Habitat as a furniture store, and home accessories was just styling that was put around the furniture,' she says. 'But the Habitat business grew in home accessories in a way that they had never anticipated. The accessories area is somewhere that one can do something much more fluid and spontaneous - you can restyle and refresh your home reasonably cheaply, and keep up to date with fashion. You can't be as flippant with furniture because you live with it.' Godley, who recently separated from the product designer Sebastian Conran has had plenty of time to understand the Habitat ethos. To be working for the company that her father-in-law founded in 1964 all seems very natural. 'A great privilege in many respects.' She recalls seeing Habitat product from the first time round in the various Conran homes: 'Still there in a kind of jaded glory. I feel that I completely absorbed the culture,' she says. 'I'm very committed and always was, from the time I was in fashion, to breaking down the elitist boundaries of design.' Her first memories of the store are as a child in Kingston in the 60s. 'There was nothing like it. It's very difficult to try to explain to young designers who don't remember it then what a powerful, revolutionary place it was. It would be a great achievement to try and build some of that electricity again in Habitat.' Since joining the company 18 months ago, Godley has been injecting some of her own electricity into everything from bath towels to dinner plates. As part of a 'techno-folk' theme, she has introduced a pixelated floral pattern for china, and has given a slightly vintage look to wine and Champagne glasses. And there's also the Blade Runner neon plastic trays. Her background in fashion is coming in very useful. 'I would say that home accessories and fashion move hand in hand. They follow the same trends. Much like the accessories market in fashion, there are people who would feel too compromised wearing the outfit but are very happy to carry the handbag or wear the shoes. That's very true of home accessories.' People are, perhaps, even more confident about introducing fashion to their homes than to their wardrobe. 'It really is as simple as some cushions and a new rug, and you've got a new living space. My grandmother used to have summer and winter curtains. We're not really far off from that happening again.' Georgina's own home, a stone's throw from Hampstead Heath, is still in the process of being dressed. She lives with her two sons in a pretty Victorian terrace. In the basement kitchen, there is a mix of clever junk shop finds and comfortable old friends. She has painted one wall with blackboard paint - the family uses it to keep a diary as well as reminders for the shopping list. At New Year, Godley and her friends wrote their resolutions on it. Upstairs, there is a long, narrow lounge, with cupboards built into the walls from floor to ceiling. There are also two distinctive pieces of Habitat furniture: the grey-felt daybed, usually covered in crumbs, bits of melted chocolate and Pikachu left by the kids and their friends, as well as a stunning, if difficult-to-clean, Perspex table called Slot, designed by Seng Watson. There is a larger, grander reception room on the first floor, which is in the process of having a luxurious leather floor laid. Lying on the floor is an electric-blue flocked chandelier. On the top floor is Godley's bedroom, with great views out on to the Heath. Behind her bed, she has installed a wall of sheepskin, a cosy contrast to the minimalism of the rest of the room. 'Moving to this house was a brilliant way to understand Habitat. I had a relatively low budget and have had to turn it round quite quickly,' she says. 'It was interesting finding out what was available on the high street for immediate delivery.' Godley has found there is no such thing as instant gratification and has had to wait for delivery, just like everyone else.",

      "body": "<p>'I'm delighted for you that this time you have borne a son,' Lance Corporal Fritz Schr\u00f6der wrote to his wife Erika in April 1944, after learning of the birth of Gerhard Fritz Kurt via the forces postal service. 'In the autumn I will be coming home.' But the Wehrmacht soldier never returned and neither did he ever see his blond-haired boy who went on to become Chancellor of Germany.</p> <p>The tank engineer was 32 when he fell at the front in Romania, for ' F\u00fchrer, Volk und Vaterland ' as his wife was informed, just six months after the birth of his only son. He was among troops fighting Russia at the start of the German collapse, who had captured a village in the Carpathian mountains of north-western Romania. Fritz and three of his comrades were shot dead by civilians.</p> <p>As they grew up, Erika told her children Gerd and his older sister Gunhild very little about their father, a labourer and groom, other than to say, 'He was a good husband and treated me well'.</p> <p>She would later recall: 'We married on 28 October, 1939, in Detmold. We intended to marry earlier but we had to prove our Aryan backgrounds and that took some time.'</p> <p>Now, 57 years after his death, the Schr\u00f6der family chronicle has been reopened, following the discovery of Fritz's resting place in the Transylvanian village of Ceanu Mare, population 4,500, near the city of Cluj.</p> <p>Gunhild Schr\u00f6der-Kamp has traced her father's body to a communal grave next to the Orthodox church where Fritz is buried along with three of his comrades. Villagers have tended the grave over the years.</p> <p>Protected by a concrete wall and decorated with a simple iron crucifix, there is neither an inscription nor a name plate: only the word of 85-year old villager and eye-witness Anica Cu that Fritz Schr\u00f6der is buried there. She and her neighbour Haberan Procopic collected the German soldiers' bodies on an ox-drawn cart and then placed them in the grave. 'I myself laid them in the open grave,' she told the tabloid Bild am Sonntag. 'Their bodies were shot up and their uniforms were covered in clay. I saw them as they lay there. Then suddenly one of them moved. He was still alive and we took him out again,' she added.</p> <p>On Friday Chancellor Schr\u00f6der expressed his 'relief and emotion' on hearing the news that the body of the father he never knew had been found, and pledged to make a private visit to Romania with his sister later this year.</p> <p>'I'm delighted and moved finally to have discovered the exact whereabouts of my father's grave,' he told the Bild daily on Friday. 'I will visit it soon - in the privacy that I hope will be granted to me.'</p> <p>Discussions are believed to be under way to have Fritz's remains returned to Germany under a 1997 war graves agreement between the two countries.</p> <p>If the Chancellor does indeed visit Ceanu he will find it a typical Romanian village: it has a single asphalt street, farm animals run free, most homes are without telephones or electricity, and there is not even a bus connecting it to the next town.</p> <p>Gunhild, an amusement arcade attendant who shares a three-room flat in Paderborn with her 87-year-old mother, was informed of the whereabouts of her father through a Berlin-based organisation which traces the fate of Wehrmacht soldiers. It wrote to her earlier this month outlining the precise location in Ceanu Mare.</p> <p>The Orthodox priest of the village, Daniel Crisan, planted a sweet cherry tree where the bodies lie five years ago. 'We looked after Fritz for almost 60 years,' he told visiting reporters, who have thrown this usually sedate village into excited chaos.</p> <p>The residents of Ceanu Mare, 235 miles north-west of Bucharest, are eager to talk. 'A military truck came with the bodies which had greyish-blue uniforms and there were leaves on the ground,' Marcu Hadarean said this weekend. He was just 14 as he witnessed German soldiers being buried in the churchyard. 'I was about 20 metres away and a Hungarian soldier told me to stand back, \"otherwise they'll shoot you,\" so I moved back,' the 71-year old peasant said. 'Some of the soldiers put a canvas sheet over the bodies. There was no ceremony.'</p> <p>There has long been much speculation about the effect that being brought up poor and fatherless had on the future Chancellor and the topic has been keenly resurrected since the discovery of Fritz's grave. The premature death of his father, psychologists have suggested, may have given Gerhard the angry drive to reach the top, and may have added to his stormy private life: the Chancellor has been married four times.</p> <p>'I was born in 1944 and I never knew my father because he died in the war,' he revealed in a 1998 inter view. 'In short, as a soldier he was sent to slaughter and had to sacrifice his body for the criminal regime of Adolf Hitler.'</p> <p>Gerd, as he was known in childhood, was brought up by his widowed mother who worked as a cleaner, sometimes taking up to six jobs at a time to make ends meet. She married her second husband, Paul Vosseler, in 1947, with whom she had a further three children. Gerhard remains close to her, affectionately calling her 'lion'.</p> <p>Asked recently if he missed his father, he replied: 'Psychologists would naturally say that to grow up fatherless can have damaging effects. But I have never felt them.'</p> <p>During her tireless research into the family history, Gunhild also stumbled across relatives whose existence the Schr\u00f6ders had known nothing of. Fritz Schr\u00f6der's brother Kurt and his daughters Inge Siegel, aged 57, and Heidelinde Munkewitz, aged 59, have been discovered living in Eisenach in the eastern German state of Thuringia. 'We would very much like to invite him if he so desires to meet his cousins,' Inge told newspapers last week.</p> <p>Gunhild said she was 'thrilled' that her search had been fruitful. 'I saw [my father] all of three times,' she told Bild am Sonntag. 'I can very faintly remember him fixing a parasol to my pushchair.'</p> <p>Meanwhile in Ceanu Mare, emotions have been put aside by the more pressing practical problems, such as where might the Chancellor stay.</p> <p>'Where would he sleep? What kind of meal would he enjoy? How would the outside world see our village?' Gavrila Oros, Ceanu's mayor, asked. 'But he is welcome here, and we will offer him chicken soup with homemade noodles, roast chicken or lamb and cozonac, a sweet yeast cake with walnuts.'</p>",

He was among troops fighting Russia at the start of the German collapse, who had captured a village in the Carpathian mountains of north-western Romania. Fritz and three of his comrades were shot dead by civilians. As they grew up, Erika told her children Gerd and his older sister Gunhild very little about their father, a labourer and groom, other than to say, 'He was a good husband and treated me well'. She would later recall: 'We married on 28 October, 1939, in Detmold. We intended to marry earlier but we had to prove our Aryan backgrounds and that took some time.' Now, 57 years after his death, the Schr\u00f6der family chronicle has been reopened, following the discovery of Fritz's resting place in the Transylvanian village of Ceanu Mare, population 4,500, near the city of Cluj. Gunhild Schr\u00f6der-Kamp has traced her father's body to a communal grave next to the Orthodox church where Fritz is buried along with three of his comrades. Villagers have tended the grave over the years. Protected by a concrete wall and decorated with a simple iron crucifix, there is neither an inscription nor a name plate: only the word of 85-year old villager and eye-witness Anica Cu that Fritz Schr\u00f6der is buried there. She and her neighbour Haberan Procopic collected the German soldiers' bodies on an ox-drawn cart and then placed them in the grave. 'I myself laid them in the open grave,' she told the tabloid Bild am Sonntag. 'Their bodies were shot up and their uniforms were covered in clay. I saw them as they lay there. Then suddenly one of them moved. He was still alive and we took him out again,' she added. On Friday Chancellor Schr\u00f6der expressed his 'relief and emotion' on hearing the news that the body of the father he never knew had been found, and pledged to make a private visit to Romania with his sister later this year. 'I'm delighted and moved finally to have discovered the exact whereabouts of my father's grave,' he told the Bild daily on Friday. 'I will visit it soon - in the privacy that I hope will be granted to me.' Discussions are believed to be under way to have Fritz's remains returned to Germany under a 1997 war graves agreement between the two countries. If the Chancellor does indeed visit Ceanu he will find it a typical Romanian village: it has a single asphalt street, farm animals run free, most homes are without telephones or electricity, and there is not even a bus connecting it to the next town. Gunhild, an amusement arcade attendant who shares a three-room flat in Paderborn with her 87-year-old mother, was informed of the whereabouts of her father through a Berlin-based organisation which traces the fate of Wehrmacht soldiers. It wrote to her earlier this month outlining the precise location in Ceanu Mare. The Orthodox priest of the village, Daniel Crisan, planted a sweet cherry tree where the bodies lie five years ago. 'We looked after Fritz for almost 60 years,' he told visiting reporters, who have thrown this usually sedate village into excited chaos. The residents of Ceanu Mare, 235 miles north-west of Bucharest, are eager to talk. 'A military truck came with the bodies which had greyish-blue uniforms and there were leaves on the ground,' Marcu Hadarean said this weekend. He was just 14 as he witnessed German soldiers being buried in the churchyard. 'I was about 20 metres away and a Hungarian soldier told me to stand back, \"otherwise they'll shoot you,\" so I moved back,' the 71-year old peasant said. 'Some of the soldiers put a canvas sheet over the bodies. There was no ceremony.' There has long been much speculation about the effect that being brought up poor and fatherless had on the future Chancellor and the topic has been keenly resurrected since the discovery of Fritz's grave. The premature death of his father, psychologists have suggested, may have given Gerhard the angry drive to reach the top, and may have added to his stormy private life: the Chancellor has been married four times. 'I was born in 1944 and I never knew my father because he died in the war,' he revealed in a 1998 inter view. 'In short, as a soldier he was sent to slaughter and had to sacrifice his body for the criminal regime of Adolf Hitler.' Gerd, as he was known in childhood, was brought up by his widowed mother who worked as a cleaner, sometimes taking up to six jobs at a time to make ends meet. She married her second husband, Paul Vosseler, in 1947, with whom she had a further three children. Gerhard remains close to her, affectionately calling her 'lion'. Asked recently if he missed his father, he replied: 'Psychologists would naturally say that to grow up fatherless can have damaging effects. But I have never felt them.' During her tireless research into the family history, Gunhild also stumbled across relatives whose existence the Schr\u00f6ders had known nothing of. Fritz Schr\u00f6der's brother Kurt and his daughters Inge Siegel, aged 57, and Heidelinde Munkewitz, aged 59, have been discovered living in Eisenach in the eastern German state of Thuringia. 'We would very much like to invite him if he so desires to meet his cousins,' Inge told newspapers last week. Gunhild said she was 'thrilled' that her search had been fruitful. 'I saw [my father] all of three times,' she told Bild am Sonntag. 'I can very faintly remember him fixing a parasol to my pushchair.' Meanwhile in Ceanu Mare, emotions have been put aside by the more pressing practical problems, such as where might the Chancellor stay. 'Where would he sleep? What kind of meal would he enjoy? How would the outside world see our village?' Gavrila Oros, Ceanu's mayor, asked. 'But he is welcome here, and we will offer him chicken soup with homemade noodles, roast chicken or lamb and cozonac, a sweet yeast cake with walnuts.'",

      "body": "<p>'Some years ago I decided that the best way to run a TV production company was to run it like an ad agency, and come up with ideas to order,' said Peter Bazalgette, creator of TV's Big Brother. It is a move that has paid off for the UK creative director of the Endemol empire.</p> <p>Bazalgette has shown that the best way to succeed in broadcasting is to take a simple idea, own it, clone it and make millions. One of his first born, Ready Steady Cook, he gently boasted, has been sold in more than 25 countries. It became a million-selling book, a magazine and a nationwide roadshow. Big Brother is an even greater lesson in the art of how to turn the obvious into a brand that can excel at home and abroad.</p> <p>Like The Weakest Link - unveiled to US audiences last week complete with Anne Robinson - and Who Wants To Be A Millionaire, Big Brother captured the global imagination with a simple format and nail-biting tension. 'Formats are simply concentrated ideas with rules,' said Bazalgette. 'The key to most of these things is to have the kind of idea that works locally for everyone.'</p> <p>And ideas like his, in television or any other sphere, are the most valuable commodities in the market today. The world is caught up in an explosion of ideas and inventions. As a testament to the extent to which they are revered, and their status in the global village, they now warrant their own annual celebration.</p> <p>Thursday marks the first World Intellectual Property Day. The date is a significant one: 26 April is the date the World Intellectual Property Organisation came into being in 1970. The Geneva-based UN agency counts 177 nations as members and is in the business of 'promoting the use and protection of works of the human spirit'.</p> <p>The day will mark the celebration and protection of intellectual property, from the kind of madcap gadgets that made Heath Robinson famous to the minds that brought us Black &amp; Decker's Workmate and the Human Genome Project.</p> <p>Laurence Smith-Higgins, of the Department of Trade and Industry's Patent Office, said: 'WIPO had the idea that, because of the growing importance of creativity in our daily lives, they would create a special day to broaden people's knowledge as to the significance of intellectual property.'</p> <p>WIPO has itself taken centre-stage partly because of the growth in counterfeit goods, such as computer games, videos of latest blockbusters like Julia Robert's new film The Mexican, music CDs and clothes. Piracy accounts for up to 7 per cent of global trade. Protection is the only means by which to curtail it.</p> <p>The US music industry last week blamed the growth in illegal recordings and inter net downloading as one reason for the first ever drop in music profits. It means that stars such as Metallica, who sued the internet music provider Napster, and former Spice Girl Emma Bunton, despite her new single reaching number one last week, can expect smaller profits if the piracy goes unchecked.</p> <p>Another major contributory factor has been the IT revolution, resulting in the downloading of software, music, images and text via the internet. World Intellectual Property Day arrives just before the creators of Napster - the software that allows for the free swapping and downloading of music files - go to court for what is expected to be the ultimate showdown with the mighty American music industry.</p> <p>Experts agree that the understanding of intellectual property has moved beyond the conversations of those that knew and understood it first. Intellectual property covers the intangible assets of a company: the idea, the patent, the copyright, the trademark, the design and the brand.</p> <p>These are things that Coca-Cola discovered more than a hundred years ago when it created a certain logo on a certain bottle for a certain drink. 'The larger, multi-national companies such as Coke, ICI, McDonald's, Glaxo, have always protected their rights, in all aspects, globally,' said Smith-Higgins.</p> <p>In recent years there has been a dramatic shift in emphasis, whereby those in the world of showbusiness and beyond have begun to realise the significance of intellectual property. Ma- donna is one of a number of celebrities who sought WIPO's assistance when her her monicker was used as the domain name for a website.</p> <p>Footballers' agents have even suggested television footage of their clients scoring goals should be their intellectual property, and for each showing of a televised goal they should receive a royalty.</p> <p>'It's more of a snowball effect,' believes Smith-Higgins. 'There is a growing awareness at every level that ideas are property like any other.'</p> <p>There will be no red noses or red ribbons to mark World Intellectual Property Day. In Britain, the Patent Office is responsible for raising awareness of the event. Officials have already produced an intellectual property website. Each of the member states of WIPO must come up with its own ideas to educate its citizens with exhibitions that illustrate the significance of intellectual property in our everyday life.</p> <p>'I invite the peoples of all nations on this first World Intellectual Property Day to join us in recognising the contribution of inventors and creators in making our world a better place', said WIPO director-general Dr Kamil Idris. 'We all share in the fruits of their ideas, their imagination, their talent and hard work.'</p> <p>To most, his words are a shorthand for reminding us that everything around us emerged from the mind of someone - making it, ultimately, their property, should we consider reproducing or copying it in any way, for profit or not. This alone should be enough to put the term 'intellectual property' further into common usage.</p> <p>'It's been used within industries such as the pharmaceutical industry for the last 20 years,' said intellectual property specialist Richard Laurence, based at Hewlett-Packard Labs, the heart of the current HP Invent campaign. In its ads, the company points out: 'There's no shortage of celebrities, is there? Even chefs are superstars. But what about the people who are really changing the world? The inventors.'</p> <p>The legal battle over Napster is not the only thing that has rattled the music industry. David Ferguson is the chairman of the Creator's Rights Alliance, which held its inaugural conference in March. 'Napster of course is theft,' he said.

      "bodyText": "'Some years ago I decided that the best way to run a TV production company was to run it like an ad agency, and come up with ideas to order,' said Peter Bazalgette, creator of TV's Big Brother. It is a move that has paid off for the UK creative director of the Endemol empire. Bazalgette has shown that the best way to succeed in broadcasting is to take a simple idea, own it, clone it and make millions. One of his first born, Ready Steady Cook, he gently boasted, has been sold in more than 25 countries. It became a million-selling book, a magazine and a nationwide roadshow. Big Brother is an even greater lesson in the art of how to turn the obvious into a brand that can excel at home and abroad. Like The Weakest Link - unveiled to US audiences last week complete with Anne Robinson - and Who Wants To Be A Millionaire, Big Brother captured the global imagination with a simple format and nail-biting tension. 'Formats are simply concentrated ideas with rules,' said Bazalgette. 'The key to most of these things is to have the kind of idea that works locally for everyone.' And ideas like his, in television or any other sphere, are the most valuable commodities in the market today. The world is caught up in an explosion of ideas and inventions. As a testament to the extent to which they are revered, and their status in the global village, they now warrant their own annual celebration. Thursday marks the first World Intellectual Property Day. The date is a significant one: 26 April is the date the World Intellectual Property Organisation came into being in 1970. The Geneva-based UN agency counts 177 nations as members and is in the business of 'promoting the use and protection of works of the human spirit'. The day will mark the celebration and protection of intellectual property, from the kind of madcap gadgets that made Heath Robinson famous to the minds that brought us Black &amp; Decker's Workmate and the Human Genome Project. Laurence Smith-Higgins, of the Department of Trade and Industry's Patent Office, said: 'WIPO had the idea that, because of the growing importance of creativity in our daily lives, they would create a special day to broaden people's knowledge as to the significance of intellectual property.' WIPO has itself taken centre-stage partly because of the growth in counterfeit goods, such as computer games, videos of latest blockbusters like Julia Robert's new film The Mexican, music CDs and clothes. Piracy accounts for up to 7 per cent of global trade. Protection is the only means by which to curtail it. The US music industry last week blamed the growth in illegal recordings and inter net downloading as one reason for the first ever drop in music profits. It means that stars such as Metallica, who sued the internet music provider Napster, and former Spice Girl Emma Bunton, despite her new single reaching number one last week, can expect smaller profits if the piracy goes unchecked. Another major contributory factor has been the IT revolution, resulting in the downloading of software, music, images and text via the internet. World Intellectual Property Day arrives just before the creators of Napster - the software that allows for the free swapping and downloading of music files - go to court for what is expected to be the ultimate showdown with the mighty American music industry. Experts agree that the understanding of intellectual property has moved beyond the conversations of those that knew and understood it first. Intellectual property covers the intangible assets of a company: the idea, the patent, the copyright, the trademark, the design and the brand. These are things that Coca-Cola discovered more than a hundred years ago when it created a certain logo on a certain bottle for a certain drink. 'The larger, multi-national companies such as Coke, ICI, McDonald's, Glaxo, have always protected their rights, in all aspects, globally,' said Smith-Higgins. In recent years there has been a dramatic shift in emphasis, whereby those in the world of showbusiness and beyond have begun to realise the significance of intellectual property. Ma- donna is one of a number of celebrities who sought WIPO's assistance when her her monicker was used as the domain name for a website. Footballers' agents have even suggested television footage of their clients scoring goals should be their intellectual property, and for each showing of a televised goal they should receive a royalty. 'It's more of a snowball effect,' believes Smith-Higgins. 'There is a growing awareness at every level that ideas are property like any other.' There will be no red noses or red ribbons to mark World Intellectual Property Day. In Britain, the Patent Office is responsible for raising awareness of the event. Officials have already produced an intellectual property website. Each of the member states of WIPO must come up with its own ideas to educate its citizens with exhibitions that illustrate the significance of intellectual property in our everyday life. 'I invite the peoples of all nations on this first World Intellectual Property Day to join us in recognising the contribution of inventors and creators in making our world a better place', said WIPO director-general Dr Kamil Idris. 'We all share in the fruits of their ideas, their imagination, their talent and hard work.' To most, his words are a shorthand for reminding us that everything around us emerged from the mind of someone - making it, ultimately, their property, should we consider reproducing or copying it in any way, for profit or not. This alone should be enough to put the term 'intellectual property' further into common usage. 'It's been used within industries such as the pharmaceutical industry for the last 20 years,' said intellectual property specialist Richard Laurence, based at Hewlett-Packard Labs, the heart of the current HP Invent campaign. In its ads, the company points out: 'There's no shortage of celebrities, is there? Even chefs are superstars. But what about the people who are really changing the world? The inventors.' The legal battle over Napster is not the only thing that has rattled the music industry. David Ferguson is the chairman of the Creator's Rights Alliance, which held its inaugural conference in March. 'Napster of course is theft,' he said. 'It's stealing other people's ideas, by illegally copying them and making money. But this is part of a growing cancer that is a major concern within the creative industries.' The CRA lobbies on behalf of composers like Ferguson himself, as well as authors. The publishing world was drawn into the the intellectual property argument last week when a US judge was asked to rule on an application by the Margaret Mitchell estate to have the debut novel of US author Alice Randall withdrawn, on the ground that it borrowed heavily from scenes and characters in Gone With The Wind. It is, according to them, a sequel. But there's another side to the issue, according to David Ferguson. 'Large organisations, such as broadcasters, are responsible for removing royalties from the rights of creatives. Before I do a job, I have to sign a publishing deal with the broadcaster that essentially forces me to waive both my moral and intellectual rights. I could therefore have my music used for, say, a British National Party broadcast and have no control over that.' Some have pointed to the BBC as as one of the most thorough organisations in protecting global rights and merchandising for shows such as The Weakest Link - its most successful export ever. However, the organisation has for years required those interviewed for production jobs in entertainment to provide several ideas to an interview board, often for vacancies that are filled internally anyway. The applicants have little protection when something resembling their idea materialises on screen. The dotcom startup TVtoBe was launched in March. Kiaron Finnegan, the company's managing director and a former TV producer, had an idea to create a database for TV proposals, where producers could securely register their ideas. 'We can't say that it is 100 per cent secure,' he said. 'But we do have a record of the broadcasters or commissioning editors that read an idea on file, when, and how long they spent reading it.' Such a concept could not have existed without the internet. The irony is that, although the internet has made many big stars get hot under the collar, it has also emerged as a platform for the registration of ideas, whether is it the absurd concepts that appear on sites such as idea-a-day, Brainflower, Halfbakery, or the sites that offer cash for innovative ideas, such as The Global Ideas Bank. 'Protecting ideas in this way is doomed,' believes Alex Graham of Wall To Wall, the company behind TV's 1900 House . 'Ideas alone are a meaningless piece of intellectual property. Formats are the lifeblood of the creative producer, and these should not be confused with ideas'.",

      "body": "<p>The life industry, left reeling by a \u00a310bn hit from guaranteed annuities, as reported in The Observer last week, has embarked on a number of strategies to try and lessen the blow. </p> <p>Most ingenious appears to be Scottish Widows, the Lloyds TSB subsidiary, which has been 'incentivising' policyholders not to exercise their guaranteed annuity options by giving them a juicy top-up if they buy an annuity from another provider. </p> <p>Equitable Life is trying to cap its guaranteed annuity liability at current levels, estimated to be at the \u00a32bn mark. </p> <p>But why have annuities become such a horrendous liability, and what are the consequences for the life sector, already under strain from falling stock market returns and the set-up costs of stakeholder pensions? </p> <p>An annuity is a product designed to generate a pension during retirement once your pension fund has matured. It pays an annual income linked to interest rates. Guaranteed annuities have become a liability because the rate at which the guarantee was set when the policies were sold in the 1970s and 1980s, typically 11 per cent, is much higher than annuity rates being paid in the present interest rate environment, which are more like 7 or 8 per cent. </p> <p>This has left policyholders who choose to take up the guarantee in the money, while the life industry is out of pocket because it has to set aside sufficient funds to make up the difference. </p> <p>A turning point in the story came in 1998, when the Government Actuaries' Department (GAD) issued guidance on how life offices did their sums for guaranteed annuities. It instructed the life companies to assume 80 per cent or more of policyholders would choose to exercise their guaranteed annuity option when calculating the reserves need to cover the liability. </p> <p>Until then companies had been free to decide the likely level of take-up. This precipitated the Equitable crisis, one that saw the UK's oldest mutual forced to shut up shop to new business when it failed to find a buyer late last year. </p> <p>When GAD's rules came in, Equitable found it did not have the \u00a31.5bn it would require after years of distributing its returns to policyholders in the form of bonuses. </p> <p>Instead, it used a series of actuarial and accounting devices to bolster its solvency - and it signed a reinsurance deal with a Dublin-based subsidiary of GE Capital, which gave it an extra \u00a3800m for its balance sheet. </p> <p>The problem was that the deal did not cover the mutual should its stance of not honouring the guarantees given to GAR policyholders be overturned in court - which is exactly what happened when a group of policyholders won their right to the guaranteed rates in the House of Lords last July. </p> <p>The life office's new board now appears to be looking for someone to blame for the sequence of events that led up to its fall. Earlier this month it announced it had hired City law firm Herbert Smith to probe the conduct of the former board and its advisers, including former law firm Denton Wilde Sapte. </p> <p>Herbert Smith will be collecting evidence with a view to mounting a court case, which could finally see policyholders compensated. Policyholders lost out last year when Equitable suspended bonus payouts to them for seven months. </p> <p>William Clutterbuck, spokesman for Equitable, says: 'We were asked if we were going to sue at a policyholders meeting, and we vowed to leave no stone unturned. But we will only bring a lawsuit if it is not too expensive and is likely to succeed. </p> <p>'Building a case is more difficult than arguing that someone made the wrong decision. There's no point spending money on lawyers otherwise.' </p> <p>Stuart Bayliss, head of the Equitable Life Guaranteed Annuity Action Group, says: 'In terms of understanding where it all went wrong the probe will be helpful. But it will be difficult to gather information for a legal action to prove culpability. </p> <p>'It might show certain people inside Equitable what they have not admitted yet, that they did something wrong.' </p> <p>He also believes it will throw light on the actions of Equitable's former solicitors, which gave the life office some 'very heavy advice'. </p> <p>Some commentators have condemned the move to appoint a law firm as little more than a public relations exercise to appease policyholders when it is crucial that Equitable get them onside. </p> <p>On Thursday all interested parties will be meeting to thrash out the details of how to cap Equitable's GAR liability. The cap, which the majority of policyholders have to agree to, is necessary if Equitable is to come into the \u00a3500m it has been promised as the second part of its rescue package with Halifax. </p> <p>At the table with Equitable Life will be advisers Schroders and action groups. Some of the issues they will be discussing are the cost of the cap to GAR policyholders - some 78,000 policyholders will see their guarantee docked by 20 per cent if they agree to Bayliss' proposals - and a sweetener to get the non-GAR policyholders to agree to it, perhaps in the form of a special addition to the terminal bonuses. </p> <p>Bayliss hopes such a sweetener will go some way towards restoring the money that policyholders lost last year when bonuses were suspended. </p> <p>'Policyholders lost seven-twelfths of their 8 per cent bonus last year. Getting it back will cost more than the \u00a3500m that has been put forward by Halifax so far but maybe more money will come from somewhere else. Consenting to capping the liability will strengthen the reserves, which can then be allocated to policies as a terminal bonus.' </p> <p>Bayliss hopes decisions made at this week's meeting will form the basis of a directional hearing so that the cap can be cleared in the courts and put to members in the autumn. </p> <p>But the omens are not good. Equitable commissioned pollsters Mori to gauge the feelings of 1,000 policyholders towards the cap. Bayliss says early indications from Mori are that policyholders are decidedly lukewarm towards any such deal, at least until they see more details. 'They don't trust Equitable anymore,' says Bayliss. </p> <p>Equitable is not the only one with an unwieldy GAR liability on its hands, however. Some 40 life offices are affected. Although some are comfortably reserved others will have to reduce bonuses to policyholders as they struggle to pay their GAR bill. Some may even have to close to new business as a cost-cutting measure while others require a cash injection from shareholders. </p> <p>As well as caps and bribes, another ruse to limit the exposure to liabilities is to enter into a deal with a counterparty, which ensures protection against falling interest rates. With such a deal interest rate movements that work against one party work for another - but they do not come cheap. </p> <p>Royal &amp; SunAlliance is understood to have entered into such a contract for \u00a3500m. Scottish Widows has also adopted the strategy, forging links with unnamed banks. An analyst says: 'A contract for differences will make the cost of the GARs less painful. Otherwise the exposure could kill you.' </p> <p>It will be 15 years before we know the full extent of the GAR problem because that is when the majority of people who were sold the policies retire. But one thing is for sure - the life sector is about to experience a frenzy of takeover activity as weakened companies struggle to survive. </p> <p>'We are in a huge period of change due to the combined effects of the markets, stakeholder and guaranteed annuities,' an analyst said. 'Anyone in the sector could be a takeover target. If I name one I have to name 40.' </p> <p><strong>The worst hit</strong></p> <p>Abbey Life has already received hundreds of millions of pounds of shareholders' money from parent Lloyds TSB. It is understood that Lloyds has poured \u00a3100m into Abbey Life since 1998 when it had to inject \u00a3176m into Abbey because the life office fell below the legal minimum solvency levels due to escalating GAR and pensions mis-selling costs. </p> <p>Investors in Royal &amp; SunAlliance may be asked to bail out subsidiary SunAlliance &amp; London which has been landed with a \u00a3700m annuity bill. </p> <p>Norwich Union's life and pension fund is facing a \u00a31.1bn hit. It says the liability has been fully accounted for but an industry analyst says the NU fund is 'relatively weak' and will feel the strain. </p> <p>NATIONAL MUTUAL, which has a \u00a3200m liability, is reviewing its mutual status with a view to a sale and it is believed MGM Assurance could follow suit.</p>",

Most ingenious appears to be Scottish Widows, the Lloyds TSB subsidiary, which has been 'incentivising' policyholders not to exercise their guaranteed annuity options by giving them a juicy top-up if they buy an annuity from another provider. Equitable Life is trying to cap its guaranteed annuity liability at current levels, estimated to be at the \u00a32bn mark. But why have annuities become such a horrendous liability, and what are the consequences for the life sector, already under strain from falling stock market returns and the set-up costs of stakeholder pensions? An annuity is a product designed to generate a pension during retirement once your pension fund has matured. It pays an annual income linked to interest rates. Guaranteed annuities have become a liability because the rate at which the guarantee was set when the policies were sold in the 1970s and 1980s, typically 11 per cent, is much higher than annuity rates being paid in the present interest rate environment, which are more like 7 or 8 per cent. This has left policyholders who choose to take up the guarantee in the money, while the life industry is out of pocket because it has to set aside sufficient funds to make up the difference. A turning point in the story came in 1998, when the Government Actuaries' Department (GAD) issued guidance on how life offices did their sums for guaranteed annuities. It instructed the life companies to assume 80 per cent or more of policyholders would choose to exercise their guaranteed annuity option when calculating the reserves need to cover the liability. Until then companies had been free to decide the likely level of take-up. This precipitated the Equitable crisis, one that saw the UK's oldest mutual forced to shut up shop to new business when it failed to find a buyer late last year. When GAD's rules came in, Equitable found it did not have the \u00a31.5bn it would require after years of distributing its returns to policyholders in the form of bonuses. Instead, it used a series of actuarial and accounting devices to bolster its solvency - and it signed a reinsurance deal with a Dublin-based subsidiary of GE Capital, which gave it an extra \u00a3800m for its balance sheet. The problem was that the deal did not cover the mutual should its stance of not honouring the guarantees given to GAR policyholders be overturned in court - which is exactly what happened when a group of policyholders won their right to the guaranteed rates in the House of Lords last July.

But it will be difficult to gather information for a legal action to prove culpability. 'It might show certain people inside Equitable what they have not admitted yet, that they did something wrong.' He also believes it will throw light on the actions of Equitable's former solicitors, which gave the life office some 'very heavy advice'. Some commentators have condemned the move to appoint a law firm as little more than a public relations exercise to appease policyholders when it is crucial that Equitable get them onside. On Thursday all interested parties will be meeting to thrash out the details of how to cap Equitable's GAR liability. The cap, which the majority of policyholders have to agree to, is necessary if Equitable is to come into the \u00a3500m it has been promised as the second part of its rescue package with Halifax. At the table with Equitable Life will be advisers Schroders and action groups. Some of the issues they will be discussing are the cost of the cap to GAR policyholders - some 78,000 policyholders will see their guarantee docked by 20 per cent if they agree to Bayliss' proposals - and a sweetener to get the non-GAR policyholders to agree to it, perhaps in the form of a special addition to the terminal bonuses. Bayliss hopes such a sweetener will go some way towards restoring the money that policyholders lost last year when bonuses were suspended. 'Policyholders lost seven-twelfths of their 8 per cent bonus last year. Getting it back will cost more than the \u00a3500m that has been put forward by Halifax so far but maybe more money will come from somewhere else. Consenting to capping the liability will strengthen the reserves, which can then be allocated to policies as a terminal bonus.' Bayliss hopes decisions made at this week's meeting will form the basis of a directional hearing so that the cap can be cleared in the courts and put to members in the autumn. But the omens are not good. Equitable commissioned pollsters Mori to gauge the feelings of 1,000 policyholders towards the cap. Bayliss says early indications from Mori are that policyholders are decidedly lukewarm towards any such deal, at least until they see more details. 'They don't trust Equitable anymore,' says Bayliss. Equitable is not the only one with an unwieldy GAR liability on its hands, however. Some 40 life offices are affected. Although some are comfortably reserved others will have to reduce bonuses to policyholders as they struggle to pay their GAR bill. Some may even have to close to new business as a cost-cutting measure while others require a cash injection from shareholders. As well as caps and bribes, another ruse to limit the exposure to liabilities is to enter into a deal with a counterparty, which ensures protection against falling interest rates. With such a deal interest rate movements that work against one party work for another - but they do not come cheap. Royal &amp; SunAlliance is understood to have entered into such a contract for \u00a3500m. Scottish Widows has also adopted the strategy, forging links with unnamed banks. An analyst says: 'A contract for differences will make the cost of the GARs less painful. Otherwise the exposure could kill you.' It will be 15 years before we know the full extent of the GAR problem because that is when the majority of people who were sold the policies retire. But one thing is for sure - the life sector is about to experience a frenzy of takeover activity as weakened companies struggle to survive. 'We are in a huge period of change due to the combined effects of the markets, stakeholder and guaranteed annuities,' an analyst said. 'Anyone in the sector could be a takeover target. If I name one I have to name 40.' The worst hit Abbey Life has already received hundreds of millions of pounds of shareholders' money from parent Lloyds TSB. It is understood that Lloyds has poured \u00a3100m into Abbey Life since 1998 when it had to inject \u00a3176m into Abbey because the life office fell below the legal minimum solvency levels due to escalating GAR and pensions mis-selling costs. Investors in Royal &amp; SunAlliance may be asked to bail out subsidiary SunAlliance &amp; London which has been landed with a \u00a3700m annuity bill. Norwich Union's life and pension fund is facing a \u00a31.1bn hit. It says the liability has been fully accounted for but an industry analyst says the NU fund is 'relatively weak' and will feel the strain. NATIONAL MUTUAL, which has a \u00a3200m liability, is reviewing its mutual status with a view to a sale and it is believed MGM Assurance could follow suit.",

      "bodyText": "The UK economy is still at risk from a US recession, says a respected economic forecaster. Last week's interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve may be insufficient to prevent the US economy dragging down the UK, says Professor Peter Spencer, author of the Ernst &amp; Young Item Club report. 'The UK economy is slowing sharply, and the downside risks are more threatening than before,' says the fore cast, which uses the same economic model as the Treasury. The first indication of the impact of the US slowdown and the foot and mouth crisis will come on Friday, when the preliminary figure for first-quarter growth is released. The US economic situation is also increasing international pressure on the European Central Bank to cut rates on Thursday. Central bankers and finance ministers from around the world will meet next weekend in Washington for the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and the Group of Seven. 'There should be a general agreement to cut interest rates internationally by 1 per cent,' says Professor Spencer. 'But I don't think we are going to get it. Europe and the US will be at loggerheads over everything from Kyoto to trade.'",

The bait, it is claimed, is extra money if the clients take their pension funds elsewhere. </p> <p>The aim is to limit the \u00a34.1bn guaranteed annuity liability on the firm's books, according to the advisers. </p> <p>Similar guarantees plunged rival insurer Equitable Life into crisis late last year. They have become a liability because the rate at which the guarantees were set when the policies were sold in the Seventies and Eighties is much higher than current rates. </p> <p> The Observer revealed last week that life companies are having to stump up \u00a310bn to pay for the annuities, a bill which will help provoke a frenzy of takeover activity in the sector. </p> <p>Scottish Widows policyholders electing to buy an annuity with another provider will go away with a bigger pension pot than those who opt for the guarantee and stay. The top-up is to reflect the value of the guarantee they relinquish. </p> <p>'They are doing this for one of two reasons,' says Peter Quinton of the Annuity Bureau, a firm of independent financial advisers. 'They don't want the liability to rain on their book, or they want to make policyholders aware of their options.' </p> <p>A Scottish Widows official said it did not encourage clients to leave - 'but in line with best market practice [it] tells all pension policyholders at retirement that they are not restricted to taking a Scottish Widows annuity. </p> <p>'This happens whether or not there is a guaranteed annuity rate option.' </p> <p>However, advisers say Widows is encouraging the practice by writing to tell its 145,000 policyholders with guarantees about the top-ups. </p> <p>Scottish Widows, which was acquired by Lloyds TSB last year, says it has assets to match this liability. Even so, it has attempted to harness the liability by buying assets intended to protect its with-profits fund against the consequences of a future fall in interest rates. </p> <p>\u0095 Equitable Life and its policyholder action groups will meet this week to hammer out the terms of a deal to cap its \u00a32bn liability for pension guarantees. Most policyholders must support the plan before Equitable can receive \u00a3500m it has been promised as the second part of a rescue package from the Halifax.</p>",

The aim is to limit the \u00a34.1bn guaranteed annuity liability on the firm's books, according to the advisers. Similar guarantees plunged rival insurer Equitable Life into crisis late last year. They have become a liability because the rate at which the guarantees were set when the policies were sold in the Seventies and Eighties is much higher than current rates. The Observer revealed last week that life companies are having to stump up \u00a310bn to pay for the annuities, a bill which will help provoke a frenzy of takeover activity in the sector. Scottish Widows policyholders electing to buy an annuity with another provider will go away with a bigger pension pot than those who opt for the guarantee and stay. The top-up is to reflect the value of the guarantee they relinquish. 'They are doing this for one of two reasons,' says Peter Quinton of the Annuity Bureau, a firm of independent financial advisers. 'They don't want the liability to rain on their book, or they want to make policyholders aware of their options.' A Scottish Widows official said it did not encourage clients to leave - 'but in line with best market practice [it] tells all pension policyholders at retirement that they are not restricted to taking a Scottish Widows annuity. 'This happens whether or not there is a guaranteed annuity rate option.' However, advisers say Widows is encouraging the practice by writing to tell its 145,000 policyholders with guarantees about the top-ups. Scottish Widows, which was acquired by Lloyds TSB last year, says it has assets to match this liability. Even so, it has attempted to harness the liability by buying assets intended to protect its with-profits fund against the consequences of a future fall in interest rates. \u0095 Equitable Life and its policyholder action groups will meet this week to hammer out the terms of a deal to cap its \u00a32bn liability for pension guarantees. Most policyholders must support the plan before Equitable can receive \u00a3500m it has been promised as the second part of a rescue package from the Halifax.",

The word was that GlaxoSmithKline and Merck were leading the retreat. This proved to be true. Executives from the two companies contacted the United Nations Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, and urged him to broker a compromise. </p> <p>Last Sunday Annan did just that: he telephoned South African President Thabo Mbeki. Annan told Mbeki that the pharmaceuticals wanted the 1997 Medicines Act, the disputed law that gave South Africa the right to circumvent international patent law, to be amended. Mbeki refused. </p> <p>Instead, the pharmas agreed to drop the case if a joint working party between the South African government and the industry drew up regulations governing the Act. </p> <p>Vitally for the pharmas, South Africa agreed to abide by World Trade Organisation rules governing intellectual property - the notorious Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (Trips) agreement. This was what the world's media described as a landmark victory for the developing world. </p> <p>The case actually opened in the Pretoria High Court at the beginning of March after two years of on-off talks. But an affidavit by a loby group, Treatment Action Campaign, caused the case to be adjourned for six weeks at the request of the 39 pharmaceuticals. </p> <p>For the pharmas, this affidavit was the straw that broke their case. In it, eminent industry researchers swore on oath that a third of all life-saving drugs developed in the United States received federal aid to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars. </p> <p>The evidence blew a hole in the argument that multinational pharmaceuticals relied on patent law to produce multimillion-pound profits, which were then siphoned off into expensive research and development. </p> <p>'If the judge chose, he could have gone on to poke at the companies, asking them about overall pricing strategies across the world,' said one lawyer working on the case.

South Africa will now only be able to buy cheap drugs from countries, such as Thailand and India, where patents have expired. These are typically drugs used to treat malaria and tuberculosis. Combination Aids drug therapies, though, are new. Their patents have an average 14 years to run. </p> <p>Developing countries, if they are to be Trips-compliant, will have no choice but to broker discount deals with the multinationals and hope these arrangements last for many, many years.They are still at the mercy of commerce - and there is no guarantee that even deep discounts by drug companies will put them within their means. </p> <p>There is no doubt that the drug industry can afford largesse. Out of total global prescription sales of $354 billion in the last year, the market for Aids drugs was worth $4bn, just over 1 per cent. Africa, too, has been the least important market, accounting for 1 per cent of all world drug sales. Profits ran into tens of billions. </p> <p>Last Friday Merck, the world's third largest prescription drug seller, posted an 11 per cent rise in first-quarter profits on a net income of \u00a31.2bn. This week analysts expect GlaxoSmithKline pre-tax profits for the first quarter to total around \u00a31.3bn. </p> <p>Treatment Action Campaign is now determined to negotiate with drugs manufacturers. It says that even drugs sold at cost are virtually out of their financial reach and if no progress is made on sustainable Aids drug prices, it will take the industry to international courts. </p> <p>It would be well timed. Attention is now shifting to how Trips may be amended to suit developing countries. Clare Short's Department of International Development is co-ordinating a cross-government 'commission' into Trips headed by John Barton, professor of law at Stanford University. </p> <p>Trips can be circumvented if individual countries cite national emergency as a defence. Lawyers working for campaign groups and developing world governments are poring over it to define what constitutes a national emergency. </p> <p>Brown's call for an advanced purchase fund of Aids drugs for African nations is also beginning to gain momentum. The only worry is about how long will such a fund last? </p> <p>But the war on patent infringement by the pharmaceuticals goes on. Under pressure from Roche of Switzerland and Merck of the US, the United States has taken Brazil to the WTO Dispute Settlement Panel. Brazil is proud to be the most flagrant abuser of international patent law. It has just under4 million people infected with HIV. The panel is due to meet next month. Brazil faces trade embargos that would undermine any progress that the South African court case may have achieved. </p> <p>To adopt such sanctions against what is the engine room of the Latin American economy would send out strong signals to India and China, which would like to adopt similar policies. </p> <p>Defending themselves, drugs companies cite the lack of robust health care systems in developing countries. 'Even if South Africa manufactured tonnes and tonnes of drugs, they couldn't guarantee that they would reach the people who need them.' Poverty, indeed, kills people with Aids. Poor healthcare systems - and poor access to drugs. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/business/story/0,6903,476393,00.html\">Glaxo eyes \u00a3150bn bid for US rival</a><br><a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/business/story/0,6903,476405,00.html\">Big... and plotting to become bigger still</a><br><a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/business/story/0,6903,476407,00.html\">Victory?

This week analysts expect GlaxoSmithKline pre-tax profits for the first quarter to total around \u00a31.3bn. Treatment Action Campaign is now determined to negotiate with drugs manufacturers. It says that even drugs sold at cost are virtually out of their financial reach and if no progress is made on sustainable Aids drug prices, it will take the industry to international courts. It would be well timed. Attention is now shifting to how Trips may be amended to suit developing countries. Clare Short's Department of International Development is co-ordinating a cross-government 'commission' into Trips headed by John Barton, professor of law at Stanford University. Trips can be circumvented if individual countries cite national emergency as a defence. Lawyers working for campaign groups and developing world governments are poring over it to define what constitutes a national emergency. Brown's call for an advanced purchase fund of Aids drugs for African nations is also beginning to gain momentum. The only worry is about how long will such a fund last? But the war on patent infringement by the pharmaceuticals goes on. Under pressure from Roche of Switzerland and Merck of the US, the United States has taken Brazil to the WTO Dispute Settlement Panel. Brazil is proud to be the most flagrant abuser of international patent law. It has just under4 million people infected with HIV. The panel is due to meet next month. Brazil faces trade embargos that would undermine any progress that the South African court case may have achieved. To adopt such sanctions against what is the engine room of the Latin American economy would send out strong signals to India and China, which would like to adopt similar policies. Defending themselves, drugs companies cite the lack of robust health care systems in developing countries. 'Even if South Africa manufactured tonnes and tonnes of drugs, they couldn't guarantee that they would reach the people who need them.' Poverty, indeed, kills people with Aids. Poor healthcare systems - and poor access to drugs. Glaxo eyes \u00a3150bn bid for US rival Big... and plotting to become bigger still Victory? This outcome will harm us all Gamekeeper turned poacher gets to work",

      "body": "<p>Even in an interview, Tracey Emin wants to show you things, wants to spread her whole life out before you. Her studio in Brick Lane in London is anyway full of things to look at - the blankets she is making for her new White Cube show, the wedding dress she wears in her Beck\u2019s Futures film, dozens of drawings on the floor waiting for the framers. But that is not enough for her, she wants to show you more, much more - and she has filing cabinets full, vast archives of her life. When I asked whether her twin brother Paul looked like her (\u2018No, he\u2019s built like a brick house. Massive\u2019), she had to show me a photograph to prove it; when she mentions the letters she used to write telling people they could invest in her creative potential for \u00a310, she actually digs out the file.</p> <p>It is as if all the time she needs proof - proof of her existence, or maybe proof that she\u2019s telling the truth?</p> <p>When we met the first time, she said it had to be at her studio because her house was off-limits to journalists. But the second time, she wanted to show me her new studio (she is moving to a new studio round the corner, next to Gary Hume\u2019s), and somehow from there we gravitated to her house. It was surprisingly neat and smart and immaculate. Naturally, I wanted to see her bed to see if it was like My Bed, the one Charles Saatchi bought for \u00a3150,000, but she said I couldn\u2019t because Mat (Collishaw, her boyfriend) was still asleep in it - it was five in the afternoon but they\u2019d had a heavy night. So I was wandering rather disconsolately round this house thinking it was a bit characterless, a bit un-Tracey, until I noticed a white squidgy thing on the sofa. \u2018Tracey!\u2019 I squeaked, \u2018there\u2019s a used condom!\u2019 \u2018Oh dear,\u2019 she said. \u2018I knew I should have tidied up.\u2019</p> <p>Now truly it is strange to find a used condom lying on the sofa in an otherwise immaculate house. I even wondered if she planted it, but then decided she couldn\u2019t have because I was first into the room. What does it mean, Tracey, I nagged - was it because she couldn\u2019t bear to throw good sperm away? No, she huffed, she just hadn\u2019t got round to tidying up. But most people throw them away at the time, I told her in my new guise as expert on the nation\u2019s condom habits. \u2018Do they? Where?\u2019 \u2018Down the loo.\u2019 \u2018Well, I\u2019m more the sort of person that will clean them all up in the morning. And like some people use just one condom, right? But we use tons.\u2019</p> <p>Next day, Tracey rang to say she needed to see me again. She\u2019d had a dream in which she was a sparrow and I was a bumble bee and she was flying with one wing trying to show me something. Maybe the bed, I thought, or more details of her fascinating condom habits, but no, she wanted to meet in her local, the Golden Heart. I wondered what she could possibly show me in a pub, but the answer was waiting for me when I got there - her father, Enver Emin. He is 80 but totally compos mentis and still with a flash of the ladykiller he must once have been. But I was surprised to meet a Turkish Cypriot who looked so African. He explained that his father was jet black - he says there were lots of Sudanese slaves in the Ottoman Empire and he thinks his family must be descended from them.</p> <p>Anyway, Mr Emin was sitting placidly in the pub nursing a cup of tea, waiting to collect his wife Rose from Tracey\u2019s studio, where she was sewing blankets for Tracey\u2019s new show. I asked what he thought of Tracey\u2019s work and he said, \u2018I love it, but I don\u2019t understand it. She creates her own ideas, and it keeps her on her toes and keeps her happy.\u2019 He particularly likes the appliqu\u00e9 pieces, like the blankets, because they remind him of his mother. He said he was off to Cyprus on Sunday to finalise the purchase of some land to build a holiday house for Tracey and his other children. \u2018How many children have you got?\u2019 I asked, but when he said five, Tracey jumped on him, \u2018No, Dad, come on!\u2019 Apparently, he usually admits to 11 children, but he once told Tracey 23 - they range in age from 18 to 63. Then she started arguing with him about his having two families, and I was once more pitched into the boiling high drama that is her life (and art).</p> <p>Tracey and her twin brother Paul were Enver\u2019s \u2018second family\u2019 in Margate. He already had a wife and family in London when he met Tracey\u2019s mother Pam, but instead of divorcing, he simply maintained two households and commuted between them. Both sides knew about each other: \u2018My late wife used to adore Tracey.\u2019 When the twins were four, he drove them and their mother and aunt and grandmother across Europe to Turkey, installed them in a hotel on the Black Sea, then drove back to London to collect his other family, installed them in another hotel and spent two months shuttling between them.</p> <p>So it was all open and above board? Yes, he agrees, but Tracey butts in furiously: \u2018It was never above board, Dad! It\u2019s not above board to have two families, right?\u2019 She obviously picks this fight every time she sees him, she won\u2019t ever let things be. That is why her childhood pain is always so fresh and available to her art. If a wound shows any signs of healing, she\u2019ll pick the scab until it starts bleeding again. This is an incredible strength in her art - the way she can call up old emotions, feel old pains - but it must be quite a drawback in her life.</p> <p>With other artists, such as Rachel Whiteread, or Damien Hirst, you can hate the work and like the person, or vice versa, but with Tracey no such split is possible. Her art demands a sort of subservience to an Eminocentric vision of the world that feels like surrender. That is why, I think, people often resist her art for a long time and then suddenly fall for it, as Charles Saatchi did (and I did).</p> <p>The best account of Tracey\u2019s life is her video Curriculum Vitae in Tate Modern, which is so good I don\u2019t want to spoil it. But the key facts are that she was born in Margate in 1963, and lived at first \u2018like a princess\u2019 - her parents ran the Hotel International and all the staff spoilt her rotten. But then the business crashed when she was seven, \u2018And suddenly we had nothing, and we were squatting in a cottage which used to be the staff cottage\u2019. At that point her parents split up - she recalls her mum shouting, \u2018Oh go back and fuck your wife\u2019 - and from then on the little princess was just one of Margate\u2019s ordinary mob of deprived single-parent kids.</p> <p>She had no front teeth (she lost them all to calcium deficiency, the result, she says, of being a twin - she has incredibly complicated bridgework now) and no boobs till she was 13 - \u2018They grew really quickly. One minute I didn\u2019t have any tits and the next I had the biggest tits in the world.\u2019 At 13 she was raped. For the next six months she avoided boys, but then she became \u2018a slag\u2019 - her word - and started sleeping with half the boys in Margate. \u2018It was a power trip, definitely. And also I had this kind of idea - why go to another country, why not just sleep with someone to get experience? In Margate, you see, underage sex was definitely the thing to do - breaking into girls. If you hadn\u2019t lost it by the time you were 16 there was something wrong with you. It wasn\u2019t like middle England. And also, being by the sea is brilliant because there\u2019s loads of places to have sex!\u2019</p> <p>Her film Why I Never Became a Dancer - one of her three favourite pieces, along with her tent and her bed - recounts her going in for a dance competition as a teenager and all the boys shouting \u2018Slag, slag!\u2019 And so she resolved, \u2018I\u2019m out of here, I\u2019m better than all of you.\u2019 Despite having no O levels, she managed to get on a fashion diploma course and parlayed that into an art degree course at Maidstone. She got a first and went on to the Royal College - which she hated, but says it was her own fault for expecting too much of the college and not enough of herself.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Tracey\u2019s love life was a mess. At Maidstone she had a long affair with a fellow artist, Billy Childish, which \u2018did her head in\u2019. Then she had another bad affair, after the Royal College, which resulted in two abortions. Up till then she thought she couldn\u2019t get pregnant because she\u2019d had very bad gonorrhoea as a teenager and the doctor said she would be sterile. The first abortion, in 1990, was horrendously bodged because no one realised she was carrying twins: the second abortion, she says, was \u2018revenge\u2019 for the first.</p> <p>At this point she destroyed all her work and gave up art. \u2018I felt isolated, insecure, unloved, unwanted and pretty crazy, mad. I don\u2019t think I felt mad because I\u2019d had an abortion, I think I felt mad because I was angry, and because I was living on \u00a312 a week.\u2019 She got a job as a youth tutor for Southwark council and took a philosophy course at Birkbeck, \u2018And suddenly my brain - it was like doing exercises in a gym and your muscles waking up. It was brilliant.\u2019</p> <p>But she spent two years making no art at all - it was Sarah Lucas who got her back into art. They met at Sarah\u2019s City Racing show in 1992 and became instant friends. \u2018It was wild, brilliant, really love without sex, but totally passionate - it was almost like how girls are at school, that inseparable kind of thing.\u2019 Sarah said they should get a studio together, but Tracey said she wasn\u2019t interested in making art. OK, said Sarah, they\u2019d get a shop and make merchandise. It was an old shop in Bethnal Green Road, and they took it for six months and called themselves the Birds and made T-shirts saying things like \u2018I\u2019m so fucky\u2019. \u2018What was brilliant about the shop,\u2019 Tracey recalls, \u2018was it gave me a platform to find what I was good at - and what I was good at was ideas, and being un- precious about them and having an audience. Sarah was very encouraging in all this.\u2019</p> <p>Then they went to Geneva together - \u2018our Swiss convalescence\u2019 - and made loads more stuff and Jay Jopling offered Tracey an exhibition at White Cube. \u2018I thought it would be my one and only exhibition so I decided to call it My Major Retrospective. Two weeks before the show, Jay came to my tiny flat in Waterloo and apparently he left going \u2018Ohmigod, what have I done\u2019, because all I could show him was this crap, smelly old ancient things like my old passport or bits of fabric from my sofa when I was three years old. There was nothing that looked like an exhibition, so Jay left thinking he\u2019d made a big mistake.\u2019 But anyway it was a success, and 400 people turned up for the opening.</p> <p>After Sarah Lucas, her next big influence was Carl Freedman, an art curator she went out with for three years. He said if she wanted to be in his 1995 mixed show Minky Manky she had to produce something big - up till then she\u2019d only done small - and so she produced her famous tent, Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963-95 . Then she had a big solo exhibition at the South London Gallery called I Need Art Like I Need God, and, \u2018On the opening night there were a couple of thousand people and three television crews. And I walked in and thought, \u201cOhmigod, I\u2019ve arrived!\u2019 Her arrival was confirmed by her notorious appearance on a Channel 4 debate at the 1997 Turner Prize, pissed out of her mind and terribly funny - afterwards, she said, she didn\u2019t even know she\u2019d been on television, she thought she was round at some boring dinner party. And then her friend Vivienne Westwood started dressing her, which gave her a whole new audience in the fashion magazines. Westwood actually doesn\u2019t think much of Emin\u2019s art (but then she doesn\u2019t like any modern art), but she admires her style. And as Tracey says, the collaboration works to their mutual advantage, \u2018It\u2019s symbiotic. And it\u2019s fantastic for a woman of my age, 37, to be like this muse and this glamour thing - we\u2019re having fun with it.\u2019</p> <p>In 1999, Tracey hogged all the publicity for the Turner Prize with her notorious bed, and then she didn\u2019t win. She thinks it was a plot, she thinks the Tate just used her for publicity and never seriously considered giving her the prize. She is quite bitter about it, still. When I said I\u2019d forgotten who did win, she crowed, \u2018Exactly! People don\u2019t remember - it was Steve McQueen. But all the papers had my photograph, not his. Revenge is sweet.\u2019 She forced herself to keep smiling at the time, but she cried bitterly afterwards. And she blames that disappointment for the kidney infection which put her in hospital a few months later. Her health has always been precarious - one of the first things she did when she started making money was to take out private health insurance. \u2018I\u2019m sickly and I get run down and I have very bad herpes, and I like knowing that the doctor\u2019s there.\u2019</p> <p>Of course, in the past, her sickliness was exacerbated by her non-stop drinking, progressing from beer to wine to brandy through the day. \u2018When I went out, I had a brilliant bag that could hold four beers, half a bottle of brandy and cigarettes all the way round, and also I was sponsored by Bombay Sapphire Gin, so I used to always take a bottle of gin as well. And even when I didn\u2019t go out, I\u2019d be sitting round drinking.\u2019 Why this abuse? \u2018I don\u2019t think it was abuse. It was more like rock\u2019n\u2019roll !\u2019 she cackles. Her drinking got so bad about three years ago, she had constant diarrhoea and her weight went down to six-and-half stone. She also got really boringly aggressive at parties, till finally Mat and her friends said pack it in or they\u2019d leave her. So in September 1999, she gave up spirits - she still drinks wine and gets pissed at parties, but not to the same annihilating degree.</p> <p>Nowadays, she says, she looks after herself - she goes to the gym and is learning to box. And she has a good solid relationship with her fellow artist Mat Collishaw, now in its fourth year. Moreover, she is faithful - \u2018but of course I think probably no one else is!\u2019 She and Mat could afford to have children but she says she\u2019s too old and also, \u2018We have a really good life, we like it the way it is. If I keep fit and healthy, and in shape, I do actually have a few good years.\u2019</p> <p>But clearly the question of having children is preying on her mind - she\u2019s just made a film with her mother which is \u2018basically me asking her why she won\u2019t let me have children. My mum has never wanted me to have children. She thinks I would be destroying my life, even now. I asked, \u201cIs it because she thinks I\u2019m so mentally unstable she\u2019d be frightened for me?\u201d and she said, \u201cYes, that\u2019s one of the reasons\u201d. The fact that I\u2019ve got over so much, she wouldn\u2019t want anything to come into my life that would make me fragile again.\u2019</p> <p>How fragile is she? She seems cheerful and robust at present, but she has had plenty of brushes with madness in the past and at least one suicide attempt, when she threw herself off a cliff, aged 20 - \u2018But I\u2019m a really good swimmer!\u2019 There was another very bad patch around her abortion in 1990, and one three years ago - perhaps the period of self-neglect commemorated in My Bed . When she goes down, she says, it\u2019s like a spiral in which one failure reminds her of every other failure in her life - that\u2019s why she could never face taking her driving test, because if she failed it would be like failing to win the Turner Prize and every other failure before that. But now she is determined to take her driving test and keep on taking it till she passes.</p> <p>At least now she seems to have got out of the habit of destructive relationships that was such a feature of her teens and twenties. In those days, she says, she was so nihilistic she thought, \u2018I am shit, and that is why I am treated like shit.\u2019 Was success as good as she expected? \u2018Better! I\u2019m happier. I look after myself more. I\u2019m kinder to myself. I\u2019ve got a nice house. And if I didn\u2019t want to work for a couple of years I wouldn\u2019t have to - it\u2019s a great feeling, to know I\u2019m doing it because I want to do it. The downside is I get terrible stress and my mind goes blank and I lose concentration because there are people on my case all the time for all kinds of shit. People try constantly to use me and I hate it\u2019</p> <p>I must say that her life, what I saw of it, is incredibly pressured. The phone in her studio rings non-stop, and although she has a brilliant PA, Gemma, she has to keep making decisions. While I was there, she was having a great row with the ICA about the Beck\u2019s Futures exhibition because they were planning to show her new film in the bar and she wanted it in the cinema. She told Gemma to relay the news that she wouldn\u2019t be attending the opening party after all - and suddenly the director of the ICA was on the phone grovelling, saying of course she could have the cinema. \u2018The wheel that squeaks gets the oil!\u2019 she crowed as she put the phone down.</p> <p>I was amazed to see that a fortnight before her White Cube opening, half the work was still incomplete. Her stepmother was busy sewing the blankets, her assistant was building the 17ft tower, Helter Skelter , which will be the centrepiece of the show, but she hadn\u2019t even started the four paintings she had promised to make. All this, I\u2019d have thought, was panic enough, but she had also agreed to appear on Have I Got News For You and said she ought to try and read the newspapers - though her main preparation would be choosing her lowest-cleavage outfit to frighten Ian Hislop.</p> <p>She is also supposed to be writing a novel - she says it will have to be a novel rather than an autobiography because \u2018one thing that success has taught me is censorship\u2019. But why does she want to write? Are there things she can\u2019t say in her art? \u2018Yes, because - I should be careful what I say here, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m visually the best artist in the world, right? I\u2019ve got to be honest about this. But when it comes to words, I have a uniqueness that I find almost impossible in terms of art - and it\u2019s my words that actually make my art quite unique.\u2019</p> <p>Aha! This used to be my own theory about Tracey, that she was a great writer and a merely so-so artist. If you see her drawings or her blankets from a distance, without reading the words, you think pretty but not much more. It is the words that give them their edge. That is why My Bed was such a breakthrough, because it didn\u2019t rely on words - but I suspect it relied on our knowing stuff about her history which we only knew from her previous words. But I\u2019ve now revised my theory because there is a piece of hers in the Tate that is only words, For Joseph Samuels, 1981 , and although it is vividly written, it is pretty tame by her standards. So she needs both - the fierceness of the words playing off the delicacy of the art - to really make her point.</p> <p>Finally, I asked about this habit of hoarding things, the way she keeps archives of her life, never lets the past go. \u2018Perhaps it\u2019s because I never grew up.\u2019 Or is it because she needs proof - as a teenager, did people call her a liar? \u2018 Yes . And not just as a teenage girl but even as a woman. That\u2019s a good theory, I like that. And maybe I don\u2019t believe things myself, as well. Truth is such a transient thing... it\u2019s like with my work, people say, \u201cOh, the honesty and the truth behind it\u201d - but it\u2019s all edited, it\u2019s all calculated, it\u2019s all decided. I decide to show this or that part of the truth, which isn\u2019t necessarily the whole story, it\u2019s just what I decide to give you.\u2019 So with this interview - honest as far as it goes, I hope, but only a fragment of the whole Tracey.</p> <p>\u2022 Tracey Emin\u2019s show, You Forgot to Kiss My Soul, is at White Cube, 48 Hoxton Square, London N1 from 27 April.</p>",

That is why her childhood pain is always so fresh and available to her art. If a wound shows any signs of healing, she\u2019ll pick the scab until it starts bleeding again. This is an incredible strength in her art - the way she can call up old emotions, feel old pains - but it must be quite a drawback in her life. With other artists, such as Rachel Whiteread, or Damien Hirst, you can hate the work and like the person, or vice versa, but with Tracey no such split is possible. Her art demands a sort of subservience to an Eminocentric vision of the world that feels like surrender. That is why, I think, people often resist her art for a long time and then suddenly fall for it, as Charles Saatchi did (and I did). The best account of Tracey\u2019s life is her video Curriculum Vitae in Tate Modern, which is so good I don\u2019t want to spoil it. But the key facts are that she was born in Margate in 1963, and lived at first \u2018like a princess\u2019 - her parents ran the Hotel International and all the staff spoilt her rotten. But then the business crashed when she was seven, \u2018And suddenly we had nothing, and we were squatting in a cottage which used to be the staff cottage\u2019. At that point her parents split up - she recalls her mum shouting, \u2018Oh go back and fuck your wife\u2019 - and from then on the little princess was just one of Margate\u2019s ordinary mob of deprived single-parent kids. She had no front teeth (she lost them all to calcium deficiency, the result, she says, of being a twin - she has incredibly complicated bridgework now) and no boobs till she was 13 - \u2018They grew really quickly. One minute I didn\u2019t have any tits and the next I had the biggest tits in the world.\u2019 At 13 she was raped. For the next six months she avoided boys, but then she became \u2018a slag\u2019 - her word - and started sleeping with half the boys in Margate. \u2018It was a power trip, definitely. And also I had this kind of idea - why go to another country, why not just sleep with someone to get experience? In Margate, you see, underage sex was definitely the thing to do - breaking into girls. If you hadn\u2019t lost it by the time you were 16 there was something wrong with you. It wasn\u2019t like middle England. And also, being by the sea is brilliant because there\u2019s loads of places to have sex!\u2019 Her film Why I Never Became a Dancer - one of her three favourite pieces, along with her tent and her bed - recounts her going in for a dance competition as a teenager and all the boys shouting \u2018Slag, slag!\u2019 And so she resolved, \u2018I\u2019m out of here, I\u2019m better than all of you.\u2019 Despite having no O levels, she managed to get on a fashion diploma course and parlayed that into an art degree course at Maidstone. She got a first and went on to the Royal College - which she hated, but says it was her own fault for expecting too much of the college and not enough of herself. Meanwhile, Tracey\u2019s love life was a mess. At Maidstone she had a long affair with a fellow artist, Billy Childish, which \u2018did her head in\u2019. Then she had another bad affair, after the Royal College, which resulted in two abortions. Up till then she thought she couldn\u2019t get pregnant because she\u2019d had very bad gonorrhoea as a teenager and the doctor said she would be sterile. The first abortion, in 1990, was horrendously bodged because no one realised she was carrying twins: the second abortion, she says, was \u2018revenge\u2019 for the first. At this point she destroyed all her work and gave up art. \u2018I felt isolated, insecure, unloved, unwanted and pretty crazy, mad. I don\u2019t think I felt mad because I\u2019d had an abortion, I think I felt mad because I was angry, and because I was living on \u00a312 a week.\u2019 She got a job as a youth tutor for Southwark council and took a philosophy course at Birkbeck, \u2018And suddenly my brain - it was like doing exercises in a gym and your muscles waking up. It was brilliant.\u2019 But she spent two years making no art at all - it was Sarah Lucas who got her back into art. They met at Sarah\u2019s City Racing show in 1992 and became instant friends. \u2018It was wild, brilliant, really love without sex, but totally passionate - it was almost like how girls are at school, that inseparable kind of thing.\u2019 Sarah said they should get a studio together, but Tracey said she wasn\u2019t interested in making art. OK, said Sarah, they\u2019d get a shop and make merchandise. It was an old shop in Bethnal Green Road, and they took it for six months and called themselves the Birds and made T-shirts saying things like \u2018I\u2019m so fucky\u2019. \u2018What was brilliant about the shop,\u2019 Tracey recalls, \u2018was it gave me a platform to find what I was good at - and what I was good at was ideas, and being un- precious about them and having an audience. Sarah was very encouraging in all this.\u2019 Then they went to Geneva together - \u2018our Swiss convalescence\u2019 - and made loads more stuff and Jay Jopling offered Tracey an exhibition at White Cube. \u2018I thought it would be my one and only exhibition so I decided to call it My Major Retrospective. Two weeks before the show, Jay came to my tiny flat in Waterloo and apparently he left going \u2018Ohmigod, what have I done\u2019, because all I could show him was this crap, smelly old ancient things like my old passport or bits of fabric from my sofa when I was three years old. There was nothing that looked like an exhibition, so Jay left thinking he\u2019d made a big mistake.\u2019 But anyway it was a success, and 400 people turned up for the opening. After Sarah Lucas, her next big influence was Carl Freedman, an art curator she went out with for three years. He said if she wanted to be in his 1995 mixed show Minky Manky she had to produce something big - up till then she\u2019d only done small - and so she produced her famous tent, Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963-95 . Then she had a big solo exhibition at the South London Gallery called I Need Art Like I Need God, and, \u2018On the opening night there were a couple of thousand people and three television crews. And I walked in and thought, \u201cOhmigod, I\u2019ve arrived!\u2019 Her arrival was confirmed by her notorious appearance on a Channel 4 debate at the 1997 Turner Prize, pissed out of her mind and terribly funny - afterwards, she said, she didn\u2019t even know she\u2019d been on television, she thought she was round at some boring dinner party. And then her friend Vivienne Westwood started dressing her, which gave her a whole new audience in the fashion magazines. Westwood actually doesn\u2019t think much of Emin\u2019s art (but then she doesn\u2019t like any modern art), but she admires her style. And as Tracey says, the collaboration works to their mutual advantage, \u2018It\u2019s symbiotic. And it\u2019s fantastic for a woman of my age, 37, to be like this muse and this glamour thing - we\u2019re having fun with it.\u2019 In 1999, Tracey hogged all the publicity for the Turner Prize with her notorious bed, and then she didn\u2019t win. She thinks it was a plot, she thinks the Tate just used her for publicity and never seriously considered giving her the prize. She is quite bitter about it, still. When I said I\u2019d forgotten who did win, she crowed, \u2018Exactly! People don\u2019t remember - it was Steve McQueen. But all the papers had my photograph, not his. Revenge is sweet.\u2019 She forced herself to keep smiling at the time, but she cried bitterly afterwards. And she blames that disappointment for the kidney infection which put her in hospital a few months later. Her health has always been precarious - one of the first things she did when she started making money was to take out private health insurance. \u2018I\u2019m sickly and I get run down and I have very bad herpes, and I like knowing that the doctor\u2019s there.\u2019 Of course, in the past, her sickliness was exacerbated by her non-stop drinking, progressing from beer to wine to brandy through the day. \u2018When I went out, I had a brilliant bag that could hold four beers, half a bottle of brandy and cigarettes all the way round, and also I was sponsored by Bombay Sapphire Gin, so I used to always take a bottle of gin as well. And even when I didn\u2019t go out, I\u2019d be sitting round drinking.\u2019 Why this abuse? \u2018I don\u2019t think it was abuse. It was more like rock\u2019n\u2019roll !\u2019 she cackles. Her drinking got so bad about three years ago, she had constant diarrhoea and her weight went down to six-and-half stone. She also got really boringly aggressive at parties, till finally Mat and her friends said pack it in or they\u2019d leave her. So in September 1999, she gave up spirits - she still drinks wine and gets pissed at parties, but not to the same annihilating degree. Nowadays, she says, she looks after herself - she goes to the gym and is learning to box. And she has a good solid relationship with her fellow artist Mat Collishaw, now in its fourth year. Moreover, she is faithful - \u2018but of course I think probably no one else is!\u2019 She and Mat could afford to have children but she says she\u2019s too old and also, \u2018We have a really good life, we like it the way it is. If I keep fit and healthy, and in shape, I do actually have a few good years.\u2019 But clearly the question of having children is preying on her mind - she\u2019s just made a film with her mother which is \u2018basically me asking her why she won\u2019t let me have children. My mum has never wanted me to have children. She thinks I would be destroying my life, even now. I asked, \u201cIs it because she thinks I\u2019m so mentally unstable she\u2019d be frightened for me?\u201d and she said, \u201cYes, that\u2019s one of the reasons\u201d. The fact that I\u2019ve got over so much, she wouldn\u2019t want anything to come into my life that would make me fragile again.\u2019 How fragile is she? She seems cheerful and robust at present, but she has had plenty of brushes with madness in the past and at least one suicide attempt, when she threw herself off a cliff, aged 20 - \u2018But I\u2019m a really good swimmer!\u2019 There was another very bad patch around her abortion in 1990, and one three years ago - perhaps the period of self-neglect commemorated in My Bed . When she goes down, she says, it\u2019s like a spiral in which one failure reminds her of every other failure in her life - that\u2019s why she could never face taking her driving test, because if she failed it would be like failing to win the Turner Prize and every other failure before that. But now she is determined to take her driving test and keep on taking it till she passes. At least now she seems to have got out of the habit of destructive relationships that was such a feature of her teens and twenties. In those days, she says, she was so nihilistic she thought, \u2018I am shit, and that is why I am treated like shit.\u2019 Was success as good as she expected? \u2018Better! I\u2019m happier. I look after myself more. I\u2019m kinder to myself. I\u2019ve got a nice house. And if I didn\u2019t want to work for a couple of years I wouldn\u2019t have to - it\u2019s a great feeling, to know I\u2019m doing it because I want to do it. The downside is I get terrible stress and my mind goes blank and I lose concentration because there are people on my case all the time for all kinds of shit. People try constantly to use me and I hate it\u2019 I must say that her life, what I saw of it, is incredibly pressured. The phone in her studio rings non-stop, and although she has a brilliant PA, Gemma, she has to keep making decisions. While I was there, she was having a great row with the ICA about the Beck\u2019s Futures exhibition because they were planning to show her new film in the bar and she wanted it in the cinema. She told Gemma to relay the news that she wouldn\u2019t be attending the opening party after all - and suddenly the director of the ICA was on the phone grovelling, saying of course she could have the cinema. \u2018The wheel that squeaks gets the oil!\u2019 she crowed as she put the phone down. I was amazed to see that a fortnight before her White Cube opening, half the work was still incomplete. Her stepmother was busy sewing the blankets, her assistant was building the 17ft tower, Helter Skelter , which will be the centrepiece of the show, but she hadn\u2019t even started the four paintings she had promised to make. All this, I\u2019d have thought, was panic enough, but she had also agreed to appear on Have I Got News For You and said she ought to try and read the newspapers - though her main preparation would be choosing her lowest-cleavage outfit to frighten Ian Hislop. She is also supposed to be writing a novel - she says it will have to be a novel rather than an autobiography because \u2018one thing that success has taught me is censorship\u2019. But why does she want to write? Are there things she can\u2019t say in her art? \u2018Yes, because - I should be careful what I say here, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m visually the best artist in the world, right? I\u2019ve got to be honest about this. But when it comes to words, I have a uniqueness that I find almost impossible in terms of art - and it\u2019s my words that actually make my art quite unique.\u2019 Aha! This used to be my own theory about Tracey, that she was a great writer and a merely so-so artist. If you see her drawings or her blankets from a distance, without reading the words, you think pretty but not much more. It is the words that give them their edge. That is why My Bed was such a breakthrough, because it didn\u2019t rely on words - but I suspect it relied on our knowing stuff about her history which we only knew from her previous words. But I\u2019ve now revised my theory because there is a piece of hers in the Tate that is only words, For Joseph Samuels, 1981 , and although it is vividly written, it is pretty tame by her standards. So she needs both - the fierceness of the words playing off the delicacy of the art - to really make her point. Finally, I asked about this habit of hoarding things, the way she keeps archives of her life, never lets the past go. \u2018Perhaps it\u2019s because I never grew up.\u2019 Or is it because she needs proof - as a teenager, did people call her a liar? \u2018 Yes . And not just as a teenage girl but even as a woman. That\u2019s a good theory, I like that. And maybe I don\u2019t believe things myself, as well. Truth is such a transient thing... it\u2019s like with my work, people say, \u201cOh, the honesty and the truth behind it\u201d - but it\u2019s all edited, it\u2019s all calculated, it\u2019s all decided. I decide to show this or that part of the truth, which isn\u2019t necessarily the whole story, it\u2019s just what I decide to give you.\u2019 So with this interview - honest as far as it goes, I hope, but only a fragment of the whole Tracey. \u2022 Tracey Emin\u2019s show, You Forgot to Kiss My Soul, is at White Cube, 48 Hoxton Square, London N1 from 27 April.",

      "body": "<p>You may remember alleys and cats' eyes from your childhood days playing marbles, but would you recognise an indian, an onionskin, a Joseph's coat, a hard core swirl, a Christensen agate tricolour flame or a hermaphrodite? </p> <p>Sam McCarthy-Fox would. The 56-year-old printer paid 40p for half a dozen indians in an antique shop in his home town, Worthing in East Sussex. The little hoard of hand-made glass marbles, earthy-coloured with orange and blue swirls overlaid on the surface, would fetch \u00a3200 among collectors. They are now among 40,000 marbles neatly arrayed in his attic on rings of sea shell or in printers' trays. </p> <p>He says: 'I love marbles because they are so tactile. You can run them around your hand and admire their beautiful colours.' </p> <p>At Phillips' saleroom in Knowle, West Midlands, in February, 35 glass marbles dating from the turn of the century, together with a Solitaire board, fetched \u00a3736. Phillips knows its marbles and was able to catalogue the varieties - 'multi-lobed core swirl... white latticinio...' </p> <p>In the United States, hand-made glass marbles - which originated in Lauscha, in the German province of Th\u00fcringen in the late 1840s and were exported until the First World War and the advent of American marble-making machinery - can fetch up to $4,000, the price paid recently for a coveted Sulphide, a marble with a clay figure inside. This one had a figure of Teddy Roosevelt. For ancient Roman clay marbles and ancient Egyptian glass marbles, prices are in five figures. </p> <p>Marbles are big business in the United States. Since the Sixties, American contemporary glass-making, using studio-size kilns, has enjoyed a revival. A single glass sculpture can fetch over $1m. There are now scores of American glass artists making big, studio-quality marbles with fantastic swirls and ribbons. </p> <p>When I spoke to McCarthy-Fox, who is secretary of the British Marbles Board of Control - for people who actually play the game - he had just returned from the annual Good Friday British and World Championships at Tinsley Green, West Sussex. There, a crowd of 500 had watched 20 teams of six players shooting marbles into 6ft rings, trying to knock other marbles out. </p> <p>Marble contests have taken place at Tinsley Green since Elizabethan times, when, the story has it, a young man from Surrey and a young man from Sussex competed for the hand of a maiden from Tinsley, which is on the border of the two counties. They were judged equal at archery, at falconry and at wrestling. To decide a winner, they resorted to marbles. Since the game is played with an odd number of marbles, a champion emerged. History does not record his name. </p> <p>Back in 1922 in Jersey City, US, a 14-year-old boy was declared 'first world marbles champion' by his sponsors, who were evidently unaware of the three-centuries old tradition at Tinsley. In those days, marbles was as big a craze among kids as baseball. It had become a form of gambling, since many youngsters played for keeps. </p> <p>City chiefs in Jersey City, eager to turn it into a good clean sport, organised a championship for children.. The winner, Charles 'Buster' Rech, was carried shoulder high in front of 10,000 fans and a 50-piece brass band. </p> <p>Since 1994, America has had an adult marbles tournament, the Mason Cup. Its sponsors made up for having had marbles rejected as an Olympic sport by organising a grand inauguration of the tournament at which the sheriff's department of Frederick County, Maryland. </p> <p>Somehow, America's adult marbles stars, even Bob 'Radar' Darr and Megan Winkelman, four times Mason Cup winner, seem to lack the earthiness of the oldsters who have competed at Tinsley over the years. There was wiry Jim 'Atom Thumb' Longhurst, born 1893, who could flick his 'tolley' (the marble you shoot) at an old-fashioned thick-glass pint mug 4ft away and smash it. He advised young players to keep flicking their thumbs to keep them in training and to roughen new glass tolleys with a brick to give them a better grip. </p> <p>'Wee Willie' Wright, a 5ft 2in Welshman, five times winner of the individual title in the Fifties, used to sew a hot water bottle inside his coat to keep his thumb warm. </p> <p>Players never shoot with collectable hand-made marbles. The marbles are worth most in mint condition. </p> <p>You can tell a hand-made marble by its 'pontil' (pronounced: punty) marks on opposite sides of the marble. The marks were made by glass scissors snipping the glass rod as its molten end was pushed into a spherical marble mould. Glass scissors were invented around 1846 by the Lauscha glassmaker Elias Greiner. </p> <p>The rod would have been an amalgam of coloured glass rods rolled together, re-heated, then stretched to 20 or 30ft before being cut into manageable lengths. </p> <p>The American website <a href=\"http://www.marblealan.com\">Alan's Marble Collection</a> offers hand-made indians at between $25 and $150 (for a near-mint pair). There are onionskins, clear marbles containing flecks of coloured glass, at $15- $500, and latticinios, with a latticed twist, at $7.50-$40. </p> <p>Connoisseurs of machine-made marbles know their company history. The American Alley Agate company (1929-1949) still trades as Marble King. </p> <p>By coincidence, the founder's name was Lawrence Alley and alleys were originally made from alabaster. </p> <p>Prized Christensen marbles first rolled out of Martin Christensen's glass marble making machine in 1902.

      "bodyText": "You may remember alleys and cats' eyes from your childhood days playing marbles, but would you recognise an indian, an onionskin, a Joseph's coat, a hard core swirl, a Christensen agate tricolour flame or a hermaphrodite? Sam McCarthy-Fox would. The 56-year-old printer paid 40p for half a dozen indians in an antique shop in his home town, Worthing in East Sussex. The little hoard of hand-made glass marbles, earthy-coloured with orange and blue swirls overlaid on the surface, would fetch \u00a3200 among collectors. They are now among 40,000 marbles neatly arrayed in his attic on rings of sea shell or in printers' trays. He says: 'I love marbles because they are so tactile. You can run them around your hand and admire their beautiful colours.' At Phillips' saleroom in Knowle, West Midlands, in February, 35 glass marbles dating from the turn of the century, together with a Solitaire board, fetched \u00a3736. Phillips knows its marbles and was able to catalogue the varieties - 'multi-lobed core swirl... white latticinio...' In the United States, hand-made glass marbles - which originated in Lauscha, in the German province of Th\u00fcringen in the late 1840s and were exported until the First World War and the advent of American marble-making machinery - can fetch up to $4,000, the price paid recently for a coveted Sulphide, a marble with a clay figure inside. This one had a figure of Teddy Roosevelt. For ancient Roman clay marbles and ancient Egyptian glass marbles, prices are in five figures. Marbles are big business in the United States. Since the Sixties, American contemporary glass-making, using studio-size kilns, has enjoyed a revival. A single glass sculpture can fetch over $1m. There are now scores of American glass artists making big, studio-quality marbles with fantastic swirls and ribbons. When I spoke to McCarthy-Fox, who is secretary of the British Marbles Board of Control - for people who actually play the game - he had just returned from the annual Good Friday British and World Championships at Tinsley Green, West Sussex. There, a crowd of 500 had watched 20 teams of six players shooting marbles into 6ft rings, trying to knock other marbles out. Marble contests have taken place at Tinsley Green since Elizabethan times, when, the story has it, a young man from Surrey and a young man from Sussex competed for the hand of a maiden from Tinsley, which is on the border of the two counties. They were judged equal at archery, at falconry and at wrestling. To decide a winner, they resorted to marbles. Since the game is played with an odd number of marbles, a champion emerged. History does not record his name. Back in 1922 in Jersey City, US, a 14-year-old boy was declared 'first world marbles champion' by his sponsors, who were evidently unaware of the three-centuries old tradition at Tinsley. In those days, marbles was as big a craze among kids as baseball. It had become a form of gambling, since many youngsters played for keeps. City chiefs in Jersey City, eager to turn it into a good clean sport, organised a championship for children.. The winner, Charles 'Buster' Rech, was carried shoulder high in front of 10,000 fans and a 50-piece brass band. Since 1994, America has had an adult marbles tournament, the Mason Cup. Its sponsors made up for having had marbles rejected as an Olympic sport by organising a grand inauguration of the tournament at which the sheriff's department of Frederick County, Maryland. Somehow, America's adult marbles stars, even Bob 'Radar' Darr and Megan Winkelman, four times Mason Cup winner, seem to lack the earthiness of the oldsters who have competed at Tinsley over the years. There was wiry Jim 'Atom Thumb' Longhurst, born 1893, who could flick his 'tolley' (the marble you shoot) at an old-fashioned thick-glass pint mug 4ft away and smash it. He advised young players to keep flicking their thumbs to keep them in training and to roughen new glass tolleys with a brick to give them a better grip. 'Wee Willie' Wright, a 5ft 2in Welshman, five times winner of the individual title in the Fifties, used to sew a hot water bottle inside his coat to keep his thumb warm. Players never shoot with collectable hand-made marbles. The marbles are worth most in mint condition. You can tell a hand-made marble by its 'pontil' (pronounced: punty) marks on opposite sides of the marble. The marks were made by glass scissors snipping the glass rod as its molten end was pushed into a spherical marble mould. Glass scissors were invented around 1846 by the Lauscha glassmaker Elias Greiner. The rod would have been an amalgam of coloured glass rods rolled together, re-heated, then stretched to 20 or 30ft before being cut into manageable lengths. The American website Alan's Marble Collection offers hand-made indians at between $25 and $150 (for a near-mint pair). There are onionskins, clear marbles containing flecks of coloured glass, at $15- $500, and latticinios, with a latticed twist, at $7.50-$40. Connoisseurs of machine-made marbles know their company history. The American Alley Agate company (1929-1949) still trades as Marble King. By coincidence, the founder's name was Lawrence Alley and alleys were originally made from alabaster. Prized Christensen marbles first rolled out of Martin Christensen's glass marble making machine in 1902. His company folded in 1917. An offshoot company, Akro Agate, produced Aggies. Christensen marbles on Alan's Marble website range from $2.50 to $650 depending on design. Akro Agates are $5-$100. Another website offering marbles is www.blocksite.com. The American collectors' main website is www.marblemuseum.org. In this country, the House of Marbles in Bovey Tracey, Devon, invites visitors to watch marbles being made.

Here the pit deputy, who supervised the work of each coalface, was the person in the firing line. He was directly responsible for both safety and production. In a pit with faces that were hard to work and subject to roof falls, flooding and methane gas, paying attention to safety meant lower coal output. </p> <p>The deputy could not escape having to grapple with this dilemma. Colliery senior management was more remote and very much the servant of the area coal board, which set production targets.

It involves going from room to room drawing up a detailed inventory of all moveable belongings, and estimating what they would cost to buy new.

With the buildings policies, unlimited cover does not apply to claims for damages related to your legal liability as owner of the property. And there may be a limit on what you can claim for the cost of alternative accommodation if your home is so badly damaged that you can't live in it. </p> <p>Genuinely limit-free contents insurance doesn't exist either. While there may be no overall limit on what will be paid in the event of a total loss, nearly all contents policies - whether bedroom-rated or not - impose separate maximum limits for certain individual items or may exclude them altogether. </p> <p>In common with many others, the Halifax policy, for example, limits to \u00a32,000 what it will pay towards repairing or replacing anything it considers a high risk. It won't pay more than \u00a3500 for lost, stolen or dam aged bicycles.

However, a policyholder in a two-bedroom semi in Islington has seen the contents premiums inch up by 2.15 per cent so far this year, from \u00a3239.75 to \u00a3244.89. The owners of a three-bedroom semi in East Sussex will have to pay \u00a3322.11 instead of \u00a3314.47, an increase of 2.34 per cent. </p> <p>Shopping around can still transform rises into reductions - premiums can fall to as little as \u00a392 for buildings and to \u00a370 for contents, says AA Insurance Services. </p> <p>But managing director Kerry Richardson warns: 'These premium rises are the first sign that home insurers are starting to pass on losses from bad weather over winter to their customers. We expect further quarterly increases to raise premiums by at least 5 per cent by the end of the year.' </p> <p>The news comes as car insurance premiums ratchet up again. Third party, fire and theft cover has risen by 6.21 per cent over the past three months, while comprehensive policies went up by 4.40 per cent. </p> <p>Home claims following last autumn's storms and floods totalled almost \u00a3700 million, according to the Association of British Insurers (ABI). More than half of them, totalling \u00a3389m, resulted from damage to homes. The final bills are set to rise higher, as many buildings are still being repaired. </p> <p>Mary Francis, director general of the ABI, says: 'Not surprisingly, last autumn's floods have produced a very substantial repair bill: this type of natural disaster demonstrates the true value of insurance. </p> <p>'But if floods like this become more commonplace in the future, as some scientists suggest, the Government must play its part in providing adequate flood defences and enforcing planning controls. </p> <p>'We have had very useful discussions with Ministers on these issues, particularly where planning regulations are concerned. We hope that better planning, improved flood defences, and perhaps even new ideas for building design will help minimise the risk - and the cost of insurance - in vulnerable areas.' </p> <p>Yet fears are growing that thousands of households in these risky areas will not be able to obtain new home insurance, and that those who are covered will face much heftier premiums and excess charges. Some 2 million British households are in flood risk areas, the Environment Agency estimates. </p> <p>Research by online broker Screentrade says insurers are already refusing new business from the areas hardest hit by last year's floods after having to make pay-outs as high as \u00a3100,000 a time. Companies can turn people away because insurance is drawn up annually, and either party can walk away once it has expired. </p> <p>Screentrade says the major insurers Norwich Union, Direct Line and Eagle Star are refusing to take on new customers in certain parts of Kent, Yorkshire, Cornwall and Devon if they have made recent flood claims of more than \u00a35,000. Even people who have made no claim at all may have problems getting cover if their postcode shows that their homes are are 'at risk'. </p> <p>The broker says areas covered by the following postcodes have been classified by companies as being among those where the risk is greatest: </p> <p>\u0095 OX16 0SX, in Banbury, Oxfordshire. </p> <p>\u0095 DN6 9DG, in Norton, South Yorkshire. </p> <p>\u0095 TQ5 9EG, in Brixham, Devon. </p> <p>\u0095 OL14 5BZ, in Todmorden, West Yorkshire. </p> <p>\u0095 YO41 1PX, in Stamford Bridge, York. </p> <p>\u0095 PL15 8BA, in Launceston, Cornwall. </p> <p>\u0095 ME18 6JS, in Yalding, Kent. </p> <p>Direct Line says it decides on a case-by-case basis whether people in these flood-prone areas should have insurance denied or their premiums increased. </p> <p>The questions it asks prospective customers include: 'How long ago was any flooding?', 'How far away was it from your home?', 'Is the property on higher ground?' and 'What preventative measures have been taken?' </p> <p>A Direct Line spokeswoman says: 'If someone comes to us as a new-business customer and their home has been subject to flood damage we would probably not be able to offer terms.' She insists, however, that existing customers in these areas are not being penalised. </p> <p>Norwich Union admits it will probably not take on new customers who have previously been flooded, but promises to look at each case individually. It removes flood cover from existing customers only as a 'last resort' if their homes have repeatedly been under water. </p> <p>Royal and SunAlliance and Churchill, which were not included in the research, say they would provide cover in risky areas, though new customers could be subject to higher premiums and excess charges. </p> <p>The policy towards customers in risky areas comes despite reassurances from the ABI that its members would try not to exclude anyone from cover. It also says existing customers should always be able to renew their policies. </p> <p>Screentrade says shopping around for the best deal won't work if you have been flooded out. 'It is a Catch 22 - you have to stick with your current company on a higher premium or face being without insurance,' said an official of the broker. </p> <p>Your best course of action is to negotiate with your existing insurer, according to both Screentrade and the AA. This is because it is obliged to give you cover of some sort or another, while other providers may simply turn you away. </p> <p>If the insurer decides to put the rate up, ask it instead to to change the excess on the policy - the amount of a claim to be paid by the client before the insurer chips in. This is typically \u00a350. Raising it to \u00a3250 should keep premiums down and work out cheaper in the long run. </p> <p>The AA says: 'They will be happy to put it up because it means you are taking on some of the risk of living on a flood plain.' </p> <p>Unfortunately, it looks as though the higher premiums are here to stay for flood victims and those in high risk areas. 'Statistics from the Met Office show flooding is going to get worse,' Screentrade says. 'Last autumn's were just the start.' </p> <p>The Environment Agency has warned that homeowners face a tenfold rise in the risk of flooding and other weather-related damage to their property over the next century. </p> <p>Even if your home has never previously been affected, there is no guarantee you will remain safe.</p> <p><strong>How to find high ground</strong></p> <p>\u0095 Record the damage as soon as possible by making a video or taking photographs while the water is still inside your home. </p> <p>\u0095 Keep all your policy documents and passport on the first floor or higher.</p> <p>\u0095 Contact your insurer as quickly as possible and keep all receipts for all work carried out.</p> <p>\u0095 Retain receipts for any meals you have to buy because you can't cook at home. The insurer should pay part of your food bill.</p> <p>\u0095 Record the contents of your freezer.</p> <p>\u0095 Don't throw anything away. Your insurer or its loss adjuster may insist on inspecting water-damaged furniture. Keep a piece of any damaged carpet.</p> <p>\u0095 Use a builder approved by your insurer.</p> <p>\u0095 Keep a note of promises by the company, including the dates they were made.</p> <p>\u0095 Consider hiring a loss assessor who will act for you, independently of the company's adjuster. </p> <p><strong>... and how to stay there</strong></p> <p>In general there are some simple ways to minimise your insurance bill. </p> <p>\u0095 Fit new window and door locks but make sure they are approved by the insurer.</p> <p>\u0095 Reduce the amount insured - many people overestimate the value of their home contents by thousands of pounds. The average flood damage claim is for between \u00a36,000 and \u00a37,000.</p> <p>\u0095 If the house is occupied during the day, tell your insurer</p> <p>\u0095 Break away from your mortgage provider's cover. Lenders frequently bundle insurance into the mortgage deal - 70 per cent of homeowners are insured like that - but it can cost you \u00a3100 more than the best deal on the market.</p> <p>\u0095 If you shop around don't just go for the cheapest price.

The AA says: 'They will be happy to put it up because it means you are taking on some of the risk of living on a flood plain.' Unfortunately, it looks as though the higher premiums are here to stay for flood victims and those in high risk areas. 'Statistics from the Met Office show flooding is going to get worse,' Screentrade says. 'Last autumn's were just the start.' The Environment Agency has warned that homeowners face a tenfold rise in the risk of flooding and other weather-related damage to their property over the next century. Even if your home has never previously been affected, there is no guarantee you will remain safe. How to find high ground \u0095 Record the damage as soon as possible by making a video or taking photographs while the water is still inside your home. \u0095 Keep all your policy documents and passport on the first floor or higher. \u0095 Contact your insurer as quickly as possible and keep all receipts for all work carried out. \u0095 Retain receipts for any meals you have to buy because you can't cook at home. The insurer should pay part of your food bill. \u0095 Record the contents of your freezer. \u0095 Don't throw anything away. Your insurer or its loss adjuster may insist on inspecting water-damaged furniture. Keep a piece of any damaged carpet. \u0095 Use a builder approved by your insurer. \u0095 Keep a note of promises by the company, including the dates they were made. \u0095 Consider hiring a loss assessor who will act for you, independently of the company's adjuster. ... and how to stay there In general there are some simple ways to minimise your insurance bill. \u0095 Fit new window and door locks but make sure they are approved by the insurer. \u0095 Reduce the amount insured - many people overestimate the value of their home contents by thousands of pounds. The average flood damage claim is for between \u00a36,000 and \u00a37,000. \u0095 If the house is occupied during the day, tell your insurer \u0095 Break away from your mortgage provider's cover. Lenders frequently bundle insurance into the mortgage deal - 70 per cent of homeowners are insured like that - but it can cost you \u00a3100 more than the best deal on the market. \u0095 If you shop around don't just go for the cheapest price. Check what you are getting for your money in terms and conditions.",

Job satisfaction among Britain's 6 million public sector workers has plummeted over the past decade - and stress is to blame, says a new study from Warwick University. </p> <p>The study by Andrew Oswald and Jonathan Gardner found that an increase in depression, strain, sleep loss and unhappiness during the 1990s had made employment in the public sector more pressurised and less enjoyable. </p> <p>However, despite the discontent, most people in the public sector are almost completely satisfied with their job. On a scale of one (completely dissatisfied) to seven (completely satisfied), 41 per cent of the population gave their answer as six and 18 per cent went for 7. Only 2 per cent answered one. </p> <p>The sample of 5,000 workers from both the public and private sector was re-interviewed each year through the 1990s, with stress levels assessed by the answers to 12 questions used to measure mental distress and psychological ill health such as 'Can you concentrate on your work?', and 'Are you losing confidence?'. </p> <p>While public-sector workers began the 1990s with far higher levels of job satisfaction than those in the private sector, the research showed that this gap had been virtually eroded by 1998, a year of tightly controlled government spending. </p> <p>Rising stress due to a substantial increase in workload had caused the decline in job satisfaction, Oswald says. The workers, which include doctors, teachers, lecturers and civil servants, now have to face extra bureaucracy, pressure to meet targets and the introduction of working practices from the private sector. The latter was more stressful than in 1990, but not much. </p> <p>As well as an increasingly heavy workload, public-sector workers have been subjected to much evaluation, inspection and public humiliation. Oswald says: 'Public humiliation is not found in any other job. Who, apart from teachers and doctors, gets their name published all over the papers saying they are second rate?' </p> <p>This process of holding people to account has made the public sector very unpleasant to work in because human beings are not equipped to cope with it, according to Oswald. </p> <p>All groups of public-sector workers have become less satisfied at work over the past decade. But the slump in satisfaction was particularly evident in the NHS, higher education, and among those working for local government. 'Local government has been the poor relation of the public sector,' says Unison, the union that represents public-sector workers. It says the worst affected are those at the lower end of the pay scale in local government, such as cleaners and caterers. </p> <p>Unison does not find the report's conclusions surprising. It says low morale is the result of years of under-investment, both in staff and the workplace. 'The lack of pay awards and training have lead to loss of job satisfaction,' says a spokeswoman. 'Managing on a day-to-day level is stressful after years of cutbacks.' </p> <p>It also blames the threat of violence and the effects of privatisation for the poor morale. 'When a service is privatised employees are guaranteed work - at first. The prospect of restructuring hangs over them.' </p> <p>Can anything be done to turn round this unsatisfactory state of affairs? </p> <p>It has become a matter for public policy, Oswald believes. 'As a nation we have to decide how important our public services are to us. We have to offer good jobs or hand them over to the private sector. At the moment we are not in equilibrium.' </p> <p>Unison believes services should be run in-house. 'We are against privatisation and contracting out.' </p> <p>Decent pay awards and further investment are also needed to remedy the situation. A spokeswoman says: 'In the health service the amount of money that has gone in has made a difference. Investment has been at all levels. Individual learning accounts are available to all staff. They have recognised that staff at all levels are important.' </p> <p>Bad management practices also need to be eliminated, Unison says. </p> <p>The Cabinet Office thinks the civil service reform programme, launched in 1999, is helping. A spokeswoman says: 'There may be issues of motivation and stress in the public sector due to the pace of change. But our own research indicates we are investing in the right kind of personnel policies such as a family friendly environment and training.' </p> <p>But Oswald is not convinced that anything is about to change. He says: 'We expect these trends to continue. I think this is very serious for Britain.' </p> <p>Other findings of the research were that job satisfaction was u-shaped in age, with initial contentment at work during teenage years disappearing by the age of 25. Job satisfaction was discovered to be lowest when people were in their 20s and 30s and highest among staff in their 50s and 60s. </p> <p>Oswald explains: 'It is a process of adaptation. Young people just finishing university have very high expectations then they go through a very painful period which involves coming to terms with their limitations. Once they have gone through this they are happy in their work again.' This pattern is true for all types of occupations and among all nationalities. 'It is something very deep in human nature,' Oswald says. 'It is nothing to do with balancing work and home commitments as some people have reported.' </p> <p>The theory also explains why Britons with university degrees report the lowest levels of satisfaction at work. Workers with no qualifications are the happiest, the study found. </p> <p>Job satisfaction was found to be higher among women than among men, lower among blacks than whites, slightly lower in union workplaces than non-union ones, high in small workplaces, and highest of all in not-for-profit organisations. </p> <p>Women were more satisfied no matter where they came from. Oswald says two theories have been proposed to explain this. One is that women have low expectations and are more pleased with any level of achievement. The second is that they knuckle down more than men - they throw themselves into work rather than worry about external factors such as hierarchy and advancing their own status. </p> <p>So be nice next time you have to deal with a man working in the public sector.</p>",

Someone who gets the basic return and the self-employed supplementary pages, for instance, will get the 15-page version.

Some people may have been sent the simple version but need the complicated one - if, for example, you had capital gains but have not yet notified the Revenue. </p> <p>People with complicated tax affairs are best advised to get their tax return back by 30 September, the last date on which the Revenue will guarantee that it can process a tax calculation in time to notify the recipient of any payments due on 31 January. </p> <p>Perhaps the nastiest area in the calculation is capital gains. A simple purchase and sale of a block of shares may not cause a problem, but anything more tricky, such as a partial sale, can become a hideous mess.

      "body": "<p>Actor Conor Lovett's companion piece to his award-winning adaptation of Samuel Beckett's Molloy sees him marching further into Beckett's trilogy of novels with this slim, wise little solo performance. </p> <p>One has to suspend one's image of the terminally bedbound Malone in the institutional home, unable to die. Lovett stands before you, almost apologetically, talking you through the relentless churning of thoughts, as Malone's mind, \"flayed alive by memory\", spools out fragments of tales both remembered and invented. </p> <p>The staging feeds off Beckett's own pared-back stagework, with Lovett dressed in brown layers of coats and a foolish, sawn-off trilby. Trained in the Jacque Lecoq school in Paris, he brings something of the absurdist clown to this tense, nervy incarnation. He also uses a vivid natural shorthand to signal movement, landscape or characters, but there is also quite a bit of old-fashioned storytelling in his polished Cork tones. </p> <p>This is a mainly comic Malone: the lip-curling contempt occasionally breaking through the hauteur; the ugly, self-congratulatary little smirks; the impotent misanthropy. </p> <p>Lovett makes much from the dismaying description of ancient sex (\"like trying to put a pillow into a pillow-case, having it bend in two\"); and supporting shadow characters, such as Big Lambert, the bleeder of pigs, and Lemuel the psychopathic little orderly who steals fat from the soup. The piece truly darkens and engages here, as Lemuel leads his frightful crew of inmates out on their murderous excursion. </p> <p>Lovett has played larger theatres with this material, but it is a pleasure to examine him in this tiny studio, his wary eyes raking people's faces like a haunted stand-up.

      "bodyText": "Actor Conor Lovett's companion piece to his award-winning adaptation of Samuel Beckett's Molloy sees him marching further into Beckett's trilogy of novels with this slim, wise little solo performance. One has to suspend one's image of the terminally bedbound Malone in the institutional home, unable to die. Lovett stands before you, almost apologetically, talking you through the relentless churning of thoughts, as Malone's mind, \"flayed alive by memory\", spools out fragments of tales both remembered and invented. The staging feeds off Beckett's own pared-back stagework, with Lovett dressed in brown layers of coats and a foolish, sawn-off trilby. Trained in the Jacque Lecoq school in Paris, he brings something of the absurdist clown to this tense, nervy incarnation. He also uses a vivid natural shorthand to signal movement, landscape or characters, but there is also quite a bit of old-fashioned storytelling in his polished Cork tones. This is a mainly comic Malone: the lip-curling contempt occasionally breaking through the hauteur; the ugly, self-congratulatary little smirks; the impotent misanthropy. Lovett makes much from the dismaying description of ancient sex (\"like trying to put a pillow into a pillow-case, having it bend in two\"); and supporting shadow characters, such as Big Lambert, the bleeder of pigs, and Lemuel the psychopathic little orderly who steals fat from the soup. The piece truly darkens and engages here, as Lemuel leads his frightful crew of inmates out on their murderous excursion. Lovett has played larger theatres with this material, but it is a pleasure to examine him in this tiny studio, his wary eyes raking people's faces like a haunted stand-up. Directed by Judy Hegarty, it's a very clever, enjoyable, even moving piece. But maybe Lovett will have to age into greater decrepitude truly to impart Beckett's deep drone of mortal tedium, or his distant allegories of the disaster that befell Europe when Beckett was in his prime. \u0095 Until Saturday.

The idea was to dilute some of the ferocity that traditionally accompanies the occasion. </p> <p>Best, 54 and recovering at home in Ireland after having Antabuse tablets sewn into his stomach as part of his latest attempt to beat the booze, says: \"Mike and I would plan beforehand for one of us to beat the other and vice versa which would make both sets of fans happy. After that, of course, it was every man for himself.\" </p> <p>One could not imagine Roy Keane plotting for Paul Dickov to nutmeg him in the opening minute at Old Trafford today. After the week Keane has had he is more likely to launch his opponent towards the prawn sandwiches in the executive boxes. </p> <p>Some might wonder whether Keane can find the enthusiasm to do even that, given the depression that has settled on Old Trafford since Wednesday's exit from the Champions League in Munich. While today's game is life and death to City, both in terms of local pride and their Premiership status, one might have assumed it would seem like kleine bier to United, especially as the Premiership has already been won. </p> <p>Best, however, believes the fixture as tribal warfare could mean more to United, with their greater number of locally born players, than to City. United's fans might be from all over the world but Wes Brown, Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt are Manchester-born, and Phil and Gary Neville are from neighbouring Bury while City are unlikely to field a single local. </p> <p>\"It's still an enormous match,\" Best says, \"though it's probably not as intense as in my day because of all the foreigners and the fact that even the English lads in the two sides come from all over the place. </p> <p>\"When I played, nearly all United's fans were locals too. So, taking that into account and the large number of Manchester lads in each team, the games were real warfare. And you didn't dare lose or you would have to go into hiding for a week.\" </p> <p>Best discovered the passion, not to mention hatred, that exists between the two clubs when he was part of the United team that won the 1964 youth cup final after seeing off City in a two-legged semi-final. </p> <p>He says: \"City were supposed to have the best crop of youngsters in the country and Mike Doyle, who was in that side, was a real United-hater. He was shouting his mouth off about what they were going to do to us before the game but we beat them 4-1 at Old Trafford and 4-3 at Maine Road, with a total of 50,000 fans watching the two games.\" </p> <p>Best played, even though, at 18, he was already an established first-team player, and says: \"I wanted to play. Players today moan about the number of games but, when you're young, you can't play enough.\" </p> <p>He came face to face with the emotional Doyle, sometimes literally, many more times during his United career, most notably in the Manchester derby of 1970-71. \"It was the saddest derby I ever played in because I inadvertently ended the career of their full-back, Glyn Pardoe, who'd also played in that youth cup semi-final,\" Best recalls. </p> <p>\"I ran halfway across the pitch to close down a Pardoe run and went in with a sliding tackle, which was one of my specialities. But it was a slippery pitch, which carried me in faster than I thought. I heard the crack and knew immediately that he'd broken his leg. </p> <p>\"I felt sick. I just wanted to get off the pitch but there was Doyle, giving me a mouthful, as though I'd done Glyn deliberately. Afterwards, though, the City lads said it was just an accident.\" </p> <p>Best, whose several previous retirements had prompted comparisons with Frank Sinatra, had walked out of Old Trafford for good a few months before City won the derby that gave their fans the most joy, and the match- winner his most depressing scoring moment, in 1973-74. </p> <p>Denis Law, having returned to Maine Road from Old Trafford the previous summer, backheeled the goal that relegated United. Best, great friends with Law, says: \"He used to complain that I didn't pass to him enough. But for the only time in his career he wished someone else had scored that one.\" </p> <p>United fans had hoped today would find them in a position to trump that humiliation. Their ideal, if sick, scenario would have seen their side go into the match requiring three points for the Premiership title, with City needing to avoid defeat to stay up. </p> <p>Arsenal's surprise defeat at home to Middlesbrough last weekend ruined that, though a United win will still give City an enormous shove towards the Nationwide league. Best, taking a more sympathetic view, thinks that would be a crying shame. </p> <p>He feels United should be more concerned about rebuilding their own side as a vehicle capable of meeting European road standards following a disappointing, if predictable, defeat in Munich. Echoing the words of the United captain Keane, he says: \"It is no good winning the Premiership every year if they can't compete better than that against European sides.\" </p> <p>Like Ferguson, Best believes the ease with which United have turned the Premiership into a one-team league in the past two seasons may have affected their edge against sides like Bayern, who are themselves in a state of reorganisation. </p> <p>He says: \"The gap between top and bottom has become enormous and I bet that this year the points between them is bigger than ever before. When I was playing, there were always lots of teams in contention for the league - Arsenal, Manchester City, Liverpool, Leeds. Every week was a big game and a big battle. Now only a handful of teams can even give United a game and most are beaten before they get on to the pitch.\" </p> <p>Ferguson's mistake, Best reckons, may have been in believing that the only vital area of his team that needed strengthening last summer was the goalkeeper, buying just the Frenchman Fabien Barthez. </p> <p>\"Fergie has done that before, buying in one big-name player, and Barthez has proved a good purchase, despite the occasional error. When I first saw him, I wasn't sure because he is so unorthodox and he was making saves that seemed to be flukey. But he makes those saves over and over again and you realise that there's no fluke about them. He's absolutely top drawer. </p> <p>\"Jaap Stam was another critical buy for Fergie,\" Best says, \"not just because of his quickness and confidence on the ball but because he has become the voice in the defence. United had lacked that in the back four since Steve Bruce was there and, though Peter Schmeichel did a similar job, it is much better coming from an outfield player.\" </p> <p>In recent years Ferguson has failed to match the spending of even his Premiership rivals Leeds, Arsenal and Liverpool but now, Best feels, it might be time to spend on the level of European giants like Madrid and Juventus. </p> <p>United, as the world's richest club, could afford players like Luis Figo and the Brazilian Rivaldo, with whom they have been linked, though Best doubts if David Beckham would relish a move in the opposite direction, as has also been mooted. </p> <p>He says: \"I've never thought David was the sort of person who would settle in somewhere like Italy or Spain and I don't know how it would fit in with his family life. But, if he wants to win the Champions League and United aren't prepared to buy, perhaps he will have to take a chance.\"</p> <p><strong>George's best-ever United XI </strong></p> <p><strong> Peter Schmeichel (GK)</strong> </p> <p>I rate Fabien Barthez and played with two great keepers in Alex Stepney and Harry Gregg. But Schmeichel was the biggest bully. </p> <p><strong> Denis Irwin (RB)</strong> </p> <p>Denis gets in for sheer consistency. Perhaps more of a left-back but he played right-back in his first season and can play either side. </p> <p><strong> Jaap Stam (CB)</strong> </p> <p>When he's 100% fit, he's an absolutely class player, with great awareness and comfortable on the ball. You wouldn't want to mess with someone that size, either. </p> <p><strong> Martin Buchan (CB)</strong> </p> <p>I played with Martin towards the end of my time at United and was impressed by his coolness. He never seemed under pressure, rarely gave the ball away and, when he did, he was so quick to recover. </p> <p><strong> Tony Dunne (LB)</strong> </p> <p>Like Irwin, he was happy on either flank and was one of those unsung heroes of the side. I don't remember any winger ever getting the better of him. </p> <p><strong> David Beckham (RM)</strong> </p> <p>I know I've criticised him in the past but he's a fantastic crosser of the ball and I would have loved to have been on the end of some of them. Also great for dead-ball situations. </p> <p><strong> Bryan Robson (CM)</strong> </p> <p>The most difficult choice. But he gets the nod over Roy Keane and Paddy Crerand because he scored many more goals and that's a fantastic quality in a midfielder. </p> <p><strong> Nobby Stiles (CM)</strong> </p> <p>With Nobby, who would need Keane? A much better footballer than people gave him credit for. </p> <p><strong> Bobby Charlton (LM)</strong> </p> <p>He can play midfield left, wide left or centre-forward. But he'd be happy to start here and has to be in there. </p> <p><strong> George Best (F)</strong> </p> <p>I wasn't going to include myself. But when I was on fire, I could win games single-handed. </p> <p><strong> Denis Law (F)</strong> </p> <p>One of the all-time greats and best finishers.

      "bodyText": "A chill wind is blowing across Rockliffe Park. Well, no change there; there aren't too many shirt-sleeve days at Middlesbrough's splendidly equipped but exposed training ground. Even so, it's not the temperature that is sending shivers down the spines of the morose knot of supporters, relatives mostly, watching the first-team squad go through their paces. Coventry's resurgence and Boro's own inability to perform in front of their own fans means that the threat of relegation, apparently receding after Terry Venables took over first-team affairs from the hapless Bryan Robson, is again a very real possibility. The consequences need no spelling out. Even with the parachute payment, the club will measure it in tens of millions of pounds, the fans in terms of trips to Blundell Park and Gresty Road instead of Old Trafford and Highbury. They know they would also be watching a very different team. \"Some supporters think we need to go down to ensure there is root-and-branch change,\" said Rob Nichols, editor of the fanzine Fly Me To The Moon. \"The problem is last time we went down we sold Juninho for \u00a312m, which gave us money to rebuild and we got Paul Merson for \u00a35m. This time the best players would move but with the exception of [the goalkeeper] Mark Schwarzer they're over 30 and wouldn't bring in anything like that amount.

      "byline": "Pete Nichols",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>This year's British sporting rich list is a tale of two superstars and one sportswear manufacturer. In money terms, this is the year that David Beckham finally began to arrive. Though ranked only fourth in the 2000 list - with barely a quarter of Lennox Lewis's earnings - in December last, Beckham and Adidas signed the biggest boot deal ever by a British player. Next summer that will surely be matched by the highest wage deal in British sport. </p> <p>His rising status contrasts sharply with Naseem Hamed, who earned twice as much as Beckham during 2000, but has lost his Adidas deal and his last fight. Next year Beckham could well be earning twice his income. </p> <p>Interest from the major shoe and boot companies acts as an acute barometer in the wealth stakes and it was in 1995 that Adidas took on Hamed, seeing in the publicity conscious young boxer an athlete at the cutting edge, who would enhance their profile in the coveted youth market. The deal, on a fight-by-fight basis, would last over five years. At the end of 1996, a year in which he made his first three defences of the WBO featherweight title (none went the distance), Adidas rated Hamed the brightest of their three stars; Tim Henman was second, Beckham third. </p> <p>In the light of Hamed's defeat to Marco Antonio Barrera, Adidas's decision not to continue with Hamed looks almost prescient, but it did not take much of an insight to see that the boxer's marketing success story has foundered. </p> <p>Alienation of large parts of the media has contributed, but Hamed's problem is that he has failed to live up to his own hype, rather than anyone else's. </p> <p>Nobody need ask who is Adidas's main player now. Just two British sports stars rate 'global' status with the company; Beckham and Henman, the latter hardly short-changed with a contract that will bring him in excess of \u00a3750,000 during the current year.

      "bodyText": "This year's British sporting rich list is a tale of two superstars and one sportswear manufacturer. In money terms, this is the year that David Beckham finally began to arrive. Though ranked only fourth in the 2000 list - with barely a quarter of Lennox Lewis's earnings - in December last, Beckham and Adidas signed the biggest boot deal ever by a British player. Next summer that will surely be matched by the highest wage deal in British sport. His rising status contrasts sharply with Naseem Hamed, who earned twice as much as Beckham during 2000, but has lost his Adidas deal and his last fight. Next year Beckham could well be earning twice his income. Interest from the major shoe and boot companies acts as an acute barometer in the wealth stakes and it was in 1995 that Adidas took on Hamed, seeing in the publicity conscious young boxer an athlete at the cutting edge, who would enhance their profile in the coveted youth market. The deal, on a fight-by-fight basis, would last over five years. At the end of 1996, a year in which he made his first three defences of the WBO featherweight title (none went the distance), Adidas rated Hamed the brightest of their three stars; Tim Henman was second, Beckham third. In the light of Hamed's defeat to Marco Antonio Barrera, Adidas's decision not to continue with Hamed looks almost prescient, but it did not take much of an insight to see that the boxer's marketing success story has foundered. Alienation of large parts of the media has contributed, but Hamed's problem is that he has failed to live up to his own hype, rather than anyone else's. Nobody need ask who is Adidas's main player now. Just two British sports stars rate 'global' status with the company; Beckham and Henman, the latter hardly short-changed with a contract that will bring him in excess of \u00a3750,000 during the current year. Beckham, though, is some way clear. For 2001, Adidas will pay around \u00a31.25m for the services of the highest-profile star in Britain. It wasn't so long ago that people thought Reebok were mad to take on Robbie Fowler (now with Nike) at \u00a3300,000 a year. Nor would it be unreasonable to suggest (as many have) that this summer Beckham's agents, SFX, could conclude a new deal with Manchester United that may hit the \u00a35m-mark.

      "bodyText": "It has come to that time of year when carping critics with a malicious cast of mind like to look back at predictions made before the start of the season and compare them with actual events since August. The Diary is in no such position, having tipped (among others) Bristol Rovers and Luton to fight it out in the Second Division play-offs. So we will take no pleasure at all in revisiting some of the experts' views over the last few weeks of the season. First up, the Premiership relegation battle. \"Ipswich will struggle because of their lack of financial clout,\" Mark Lawrenson pointed out. Terry Venables shared his view: \"I expect Manchester City to stay up but I fear for Ipswich and Charlton,\" he boldly asserted. One team not in danger, he thought, was Middlesbrough. \"There always seems to be a bit of grumbling from fans at the Riverside. I don't understand it - they're established in the Premiership. In Bryan Robson they have an outstanding manager and Steve Gibson is a great chairman. I am confident they will progress.\" Almost spooky. Great European excuses No1, from the Galatasaray coach Mircea Lucescu after his side's 3-0 defeat in Madrid: \"I think the referee was influenced by the atmosphere in the stadium.\" A totally new experience for the Istanbul club, then. Great European excuses No2, from Barcelona's coach Llorenc Serra Ferrer: \"We were the superior side and Barcelona's greatness does not depend on a single result.\" Not so much an excuse, more a denial. Gerard Houllier should complain (well, he shouldn't, but that's another story). Ryman League Canvey Island played three league games this week - all won. Today they host Aldershot. On Monday it's the Essex Senior Cup final, then follow league games on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday, Sunday and Tuesday, all away, before the season ends with three in three days. If they win them all, they could be in the Conference. Or hospital.

      "body": "<p>The man chasing me is brandishing a big stick. He's dressed in a suit made of animal skins and has a blackened face topped by a helmet adorned with goat horns. When he gets close enough he roars and throws a bag of ash over me. A little girl scrambles, crying, on to the flat roof of her home. She is frightened of the man with the big stick. I know how she feels. </p> <p>In the Berber villages of the Toubkal region in Morocco's High Atlas mountains, this unorthodox game of tag is the aftermath of the Tafaska - the feast of the lamb - which commemorates Abraham's sacrifice of a sheep in place of his son and is held 60 days after Ramadan. Sheep and goats are slaughtered for feasting, and the skins are stitched into suits, worn for four pungent days. </p> <p>Just 24 hours after leaving London, I am dashing about the terraced fields of apple trees with the village boys and men who are old enough to know better. Even my guide, Mohammed Elaamri, also a Berber, thinks it's all a little strange. Above us in the village of Aremd, every rooftop and street corner is filled with people swaying, jigging, dancing, chanting, clapping or banging a tambourine-style drum. By dusk, the goat-skinned men - there are up to eight of them each day - are knackered. The game ends with the muezzin's wailing call to prayer echoing around the surrounding mountains. </p> <p>Morocco has all the advantages of being just 14km from Gibraltar, at the tip of southern Spain. It's close, but as different from a European break as you could wish for. And there's no visa documents or health precautions to worry about. </p> <p>My flight arrived in Marrakech at about 11pm. The airport is only 4km from the medina - the peach-walled old town - and by 11.30pm I was in a different world. A succession of strong-smelling alleyways snaked through the city leading, unikely though it seemed, to the door of my hotel, Riad Les Cigognes. </p> <p>Moorish architecture looks inwards; behind anonymous doors and walls is a hidden world of tiled courtyards with flourishing citrus trees, palms, bougainvillaea and fountains. I was staying in a riad or maison d'hte , a kind of upmarket B&amp;B. Old properties in the medina and the neighbouring kasbah, the fortified town, are being bought and restored, providing beautiful, peaceful and intimate accommodation in the heart of the city. There are usually fewer than six rooms and rates are very affordable - between \u00a325 and \u00a370 for a double room with breakfast. </p> <p>My plan was to spend two days hiking in the High Atlas mountains, then return to explore Marrakech for an evening and morning before the flight home on Sunday afternoon. </p> <p>Topping out at over 4,000 metres, the Toubkal is the country's highest massif, although I was only trekking at around the 2,000m. The treeline peters out at the village of Imlil at around 1,500m, where there's a clutch of small hotels, caf\u00e9s and shops selling everything from Mars bars to guttering. </p> <p>Imlil is an hour and a half by road from Marrakech, the last 20 minutes on a swaying mountain dirt track clinging to the contours. The villagers have voted not to have it paved as they like their semi-isolation at the head of the valley and are worried about being inundated by Moroccan tourists in their cars. </p> <p>With my pack strapped to a mule, we walked for 45 minutes over the pass to Aremd, Considering this is the closest village to the country's highest mountain, it is surprisingly free of tourist trappings. The Gte d'Omar in Aremd can accommodate 20 or so people, several to a room. The facilities are basic, but there is a shower - cold water is free, hot water costs 10 dirhams (70p). Fatima, Omar's wife, and her daughter-in-law bake fresh bread daily and cook delicious tajines - meat and vegetable stews cooked in earthenware pots with conical lids. </p> <p>On my first day of walking we climbed to the tizi (mountain pass) that gave us a spectacular view into the neighbouring Tacheddirt valley. Walking at a steady pace that still left me breathless on the steepest parts, we saw few other tourists. It was quiet in early March, the beginning of the season in the High Atlas, but the sun was already strong, burning my face before I realised it. In the late afternoons, the temperature began to fall, and by the evening I was wearing two fleeces, jacket, thermal underwear, hat and gloves. </p> <p>Descending through the sweet-smelling pines and gnarled junipers we saw the summit of Toubkal in the distance, a faint triangular point against the blue sky. Below were well-kept terraces of fruit trees covered in spring blossom. Boulders and scree covered the valley floor, the aftermath of dangerous flash floods that had been caused by summer storms. </p> <p>Later, the first star of the evening, the Etoile de berger or shepherd's star, rose in the sky and, on cue, dark blobs on the mountainside began moving across and down the slopes. The flocks were coming home. </p> <p>Returning to Marrakech after two days in the mountains was a culture shock - the sheer numbers of people, the rapidly changing smells, sounds and sights, but I discovered that the trick is to go with the flow. Be prepared to wander; if you follow the crowds, sooner or later you will end up in the huge square that is Djemaa El Fna. </p> <p>On Saturday nights, the medina seems to draw everyone in the city. Get your bearings over a glass of fresh orange juice from the stalls ringing the edges of the square. Then it's time to check out the entertainment. There is something for everyone; fire eaters and snake charmers, musicians, magicians and monkey tamers, storytellers and scribes. Caf\u00e9 de France has the best terrace panoramique . </p> <p>Marrakech has four distinct parts - the fortified kasbah, the medina, the Jew ish mellah, and Gueliz, the new part of town built by the French early in the last century. There are many historical monuments but with just a half-day of exploration open to me, I picked out a few places to visit. Bahia Palace has ornate plasterwork and painted ceilings that have survived the city's dry desert climate. A dynasty of sultans and their many wives are buried in opulence in the 16th-century Saadian tombs, the walls decorated with marble and gilded cedar wood. The serene Majorelle Gardens, now owned by Yves Saint Laurent, offer a shady retreat if the bustle of the medina gets too much. </p> <p>Finally, I made for the souks, where there are more than 2,800 shops selling Berber jewellery, slippers, leather goods and carpets that can be \"DHL-ed to your home\". I even passed a shop selling thrones. I saw carpets being woven and wool being dyed using pomegranate and saffron. I learned that the leather of goats and gazelles is much better quality than sheep or camels. </p> <p>I spent the flight home bemoaning what I had not had the time to do, such as having a henna design painted on my hands, paying a visit to a hammam (public bath), or riding a camel. But, of course, it gives me the perfect excuse to make a return trip.</p> <p><strong>Way to go</strong></p> <p>Lisa Sykes travelled with <a href=\"http://www.tribes.co.uk\">Tribes</a> (01728 685971) and flew to Marrakech with <a href=\"http://www.royalairmaroc.co.uk\">Royal Air Maroc</a> (020-7439 4361). Tribes can tailor-make trips to Marrakech and the High Atlas Mountains. A four-night trip with two nights' B&amp;B at a riad and two nights' full board in Aremd, with transport, a mountain guide and a city guide costs \u00a3645pp including flights. A long weekend in Marrakech, without the trekking, is cheaper. Royal Air Maroc flies direct to Marrakech three times a week from Stansted and daily via Casablanca from Heathrow. Return fares from \u00a3280 including taxes. </p> <p>In Marrakech, Riad Les Cigognes, (00 212 44 384791) has doubles from 400 dirhams (\u00a326), including breakfast. There are three double rooms plus a suite with two doubles and a lounge. Dinner is available for a minimum of four people. Other riads include: Riad Kaiss (440141), Riad El Arsat (387567), Dar Mouassine (445287), Dar Zina (385242), Dar Sara (385858).</p> <p><strong>When to go</strong></p> <p>March to May and late September to November are the best times to visit; avoid July and August, when Marrakech is very hot, and in the winter when the High Atlas are covered in snow.</p> <p><strong>Reading</strong></p> <p>Visit <a href=\"http://www.booktailor.com\">www.booktailor.com</a> where you can put together your own customised guidebook for Marrakech and the mountains, for under \u00a320, choosing the best bits from guidebook publishers and travel writers. <a href=\"http://www.tourism-in-morocco.com\">Morocco National Tourist Office</a> (020-7437 0073).</p> <p><strong>Ultimate weekends</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://travel.guardianunlimited.co.uk/weekenders/story/0,7454,475812,00.html\">Dream tickets</a> <br>The Ice Hotel in Lapland, shopping in Dubai, or perhaps touring Britain in an Aston Martin DB6.

      "bodyText": "The man chasing me is brandishing a big stick. He's dressed in a suit made of animal skins and has a blackened face topped by a helmet adorned with goat horns. When he gets close enough he roars and throws a bag of ash over me. A little girl scrambles, crying, on to the flat roof of her home. She is frightened of the man with the big stick. I know how she feels. In the Berber villages of the Toubkal region in Morocco's High Atlas mountains, this unorthodox game of tag is the aftermath of the Tafaska - the feast of the lamb - which commemorates Abraham's sacrifice of a sheep in place of his son and is held 60 days after Ramadan. Sheep and goats are slaughtered for feasting, and the skins are stitched into suits, worn for four pungent days. Just 24 hours after leaving London, I am dashing about the terraced fields of apple trees with the village boys and men who are old enough to know better. Even my guide, Mohammed Elaamri, also a Berber, thinks it's all a little strange. Above us in the village of Aremd, every rooftop and street corner is filled with people swaying, jigging, dancing, chanting, clapping or banging a tambourine-style drum. By dusk, the goat-skinned men - there are up to eight of them each day - are knackered. The game ends with the muezzin's wailing call to prayer echoing around the surrounding mountains. Morocco has all the advantages of being just 14km from Gibraltar, at the tip of southern Spain. It's close, but as different from a European break as you could wish for. And there's no visa documents or health precautions to worry about. My flight arrived in Marrakech at about 11pm. The airport is only 4km from the medina - the peach-walled old town - and by 11.30pm I was in a different world. A succession of strong-smelling alleyways snaked through the city leading, unikely though it seemed, to the door of my hotel, Riad Les Cigognes. Moorish architecture looks inwards; behind anonymous doors and walls is a hidden world of tiled courtyards with flourishing citrus trees, palms, bougainvillaea and fountains. I was staying in a riad or maison d'hte , a kind of upmarket B&amp;B. Old properties in the medina and the neighbouring kasbah, the fortified town, are being bought and restored, providing beautiful, peaceful and intimate accommodation in the heart of the city. There are usually fewer than six rooms and rates are very affordable - between \u00a325 and \u00a370 for a double room with breakfast. My plan was to spend two days hiking in the High Atlas mountains, then return to explore Marrakech for an evening and morning before the flight home on Sunday afternoon. Topping out at over 4,000 metres, the Toubkal is the country's highest massif, although I was only trekking at around the 2,000m. The treeline peters out at the village of Imlil at around 1,500m, where there's a clutch of small hotels, caf\u00e9s and shops selling everything from Mars bars to guttering. Imlil is an hour and a half by road from Marrakech, the last 20 minutes on a swaying mountain dirt track clinging to the contours. The villagers have voted not to have it paved as they like their semi-isolation at the head of the valley and are worried about being inundated by Moroccan tourists in their cars. With my pack strapped to a mule, we walked for 45 minutes over the pass to Aremd, Considering this is the closest village to the country's highest mountain, it is surprisingly free of tourist trappings. The Gte d'Omar in Aremd can accommodate 20 or so people, several to a room. The facilities are basic, but there is a shower - cold water is free, hot water costs 10 dirhams (70p). Fatima, Omar's wife, and her daughter-in-law bake fresh bread daily and cook delicious tajines - meat and vegetable stews cooked in earthenware pots with conical lids. On my first day of walking we climbed to the tizi (mountain pass) that gave us a spectacular view into the neighbouring Tacheddirt valley. Walking at a steady pace that still left me breathless on the steepest parts, we saw few other tourists. It was quiet in early March, the beginning of the season in the High Atlas, but the sun was already strong, burning my face before I realised it. In the late afternoons, the temperature began to fall, and by the evening I was wearing two fleeces, jacket, thermal underwear, hat and gloves. Descending through the sweet-smelling pines and gnarled junipers we saw the summit of Toubkal in the distance, a faint triangular point against the blue sky. Below were well-kept terraces of fruit trees covered in spring blossom. Boulders and scree covered the valley floor, the aftermath of dangerous flash floods that had been caused by summer storms. Later, the first star of the evening, the Etoile de berger or shepherd's star, rose in the sky and, on cue, dark blobs on the mountainside began moving across and down the slopes. The flocks were coming home. Returning to Marrakech after two days in the mountains was a culture shock - the sheer numbers of people, the rapidly changing smells, sounds and sights, but I discovered that the trick is to go with the flow. Be prepared to wander; if you follow the crowds, sooner or later you will end up in the huge square that is Djemaa El Fna. On Saturday nights, the medina seems to draw everyone in the city. Get your bearings over a glass of fresh orange juice from the stalls ringing the edges of the square. Then it's time to check out the entertainment. There is something for everyone; fire eaters and snake charmers, musicians, magicians and monkey tamers, storytellers and scribes. Caf\u00e9 de France has the best terrace panoramique . Marrakech has four distinct parts - the fortified kasbah, the medina, the Jew ish mellah, and Gueliz, the new part of town built by the French early in the last century. There are many historical monuments but with just a half-day of exploration open to me, I picked out a few places to visit. Bahia Palace has ornate plasterwork and painted ceilings that have survived the city's dry desert climate. A dynasty of sultans and their many wives are buried in opulence in the 16th-century Saadian tombs, the walls decorated with marble and gilded cedar wood. The serene Majorelle Gardens, now owned by Yves Saint Laurent, offer a shady retreat if the bustle of the medina gets too much. Finally, I made for the souks, where there are more than 2,800 shops selling Berber jewellery, slippers, leather goods and carpets that can be \"DHL-ed to your home\". I even passed a shop selling thrones. I saw carpets being woven and wool being dyed using pomegranate and saffron. I learned that the leather of goats and gazelles is much better quality than sheep or camels. I spent the flight home bemoaning what I had not had the time to do, such as having a henna design painted on my hands, paying a visit to a hammam (public bath), or riding a camel. But, of course, it gives me the perfect excuse to make a return trip. Way to go Lisa Sykes travelled with Tribes (01728 685971) and flew to Marrakech with Royal Air Maroc (020-7439 4361). Tribes can tailor-make trips to Marrakech and the High Atlas Mountains. A four-night trip with two nights' B&amp;B at a riad and two nights' full board in Aremd, with transport, a mountain guide and a city guide costs \u00a3645pp including flights. A long weekend in Marrakech, without the trekking, is cheaper. Royal Air Maroc flies direct to Marrakech three times a week from Stansted and daily via Casablanca from Heathrow. Return fares from \u00a3280 including taxes. In Marrakech, Riad Les Cigognes, (00 212 44 384791) has doubles from 400 dirhams (\u00a326), including breakfast. There are three double rooms plus a suite with two doubles and a lounge. Dinner is available for a minimum of four people. Other riads include: Riad Kaiss (440141), Riad El Arsat (387567), Dar Mouassine (445287), Dar Zina (385242), Dar Sara (385858). When to go March to May and late September to November are the best times to visit; avoid July and August, when Marrakech is very hot, and in the winter when the High Atlas are covered in snow.

      "body": "<p>We never got the chance to meet Gualtiero Marchesi. He was around, no doubt about that. The bartender told us so, and when it comes to keeping up with events in a hotel, especially in a five-star luxury hotel, there is no better source of information. So, yes, Mr Marchesi had been around earlier, making sure everything was in order in the kitchen. </p> <p>But if our paths had crossed, what would I have said anyway? \"Mr Marchesi, can I just say that dinner was fantastic.\" Or \"Hey, Gualtiero, you know that thing you do with the baby squid? Just run it past me one more time.\" </p> <p>No. On reflection, it was definitely for the best. After all, when you are not only credited as being the first Italian to pick up a third Michelin star but also lauded as the father of l'alta cucina, then there can be no more unappetising sight first thing in the morning than an over-excited guest pacing towards you over the lawn of L'Albereta. The 19th-century hunting lodge, which has been transformed into a country house hotel and stands in the Franciacorta region of northern Italy, is where Marchesi chose as the home for his restaurant after many years in his native Milan. </p> <p>Nevertheless, it would have been a pleasure to have shaken the hand that designed the previous evening's 12-course dinner. Called simply \"Oggi\", meaning today, the menu is constructed from whatever catches the eye at that morning's market. Marchesi and his team of chefs then transform the produce into dishes that are as visually exciting as they are delicious, using the plate as a canvas upon which to construct each masterpiece. </p> <p>On the evening in question, this approach was exemplified by our calamaretti, the detached bodies and tentacles of the baby squid separated by a broad black brush stroke of their own ink that arced across the white china plate. The dish served to confirm what an earlier flirtation in the evening with raw scallops in ginger accompanied by slightly sweet, pungent pink pepper had suggested: that Mr Marchesi had a considerable appreciation of Japanese cooking. But European influences were there, too, in the shape of fois gras wrapped in cabbage, a delicately roasted quail, and the largest prawn I have ever seen. \"No sir, it is not a langoustine.\" Was I arguing? </p> <p>We were expecting the unexpected but even so nothing prepared us for the ice cream made from taleggio cheese or the uovo della passione, which comprised a sugar-coated egg yolk. Strange combination? Perhaps, but it was all delicious, and as light on the palate as it was on the stomach. No heavy sauces here, thank you very much. </p> <p>We went to bed feeling that the need for pampering that had brought us to the hotel had reached a new level. Yes, the Jacuzzi, indoor pool and sauna had all been very nice. The invitation to play the local 18-hole course had been politely declined in the interests of self-esteem, although for one moment I had thought of taking up the offer of a tourist-friendly horse for a ride in the Franciacorta countryside. But the reputation of Marchesi was what brought us here, and he had not disappointed, his chefs busying themselves at the stoves visible through the large glass window at the end of the gallery restaurant. </p> <p>It was easy to see what inspired Marchesi to head for the outer reaches of Lombardy in the early 90s. Not only was he slap bang in the middle of one the most fertile centres of viniculture in the world, but the country house allowed him the space in which to develop his ideas away from the constant gaze of big-city restaurant critics. </p> <p>New territory was very much on our agenda, too, and foregoing the pleasures of the mountain bikes for four wheels - come on, Sophia Loren ranks among the high-profile guests to have graced the well-appointed halls and bedrooms of this establishment, and do you really think she had packed her bicycle clips? - we began our tour with a visit to the monastery of San Pietro in Lamosa. The building was taken over by Benedictine friars from Cluny on the other side of the Alps in the 11th century, but since being abandoned by the order had endured both neglect and repeated acts of vandalism. However the efforts of local parishioners in recent years have saved it and the precious frescoes within from destruction. </p> <p>Lake Iseo, visible from the monastery, has long existed in the shadow of its more famous near neighbour, Garda, but in the summer months there is no shortage of expensive yachts mooring at the quayside while ferries transport a steady stream of sightseers to Montisola, the largest island on the Italian lakes. For many years, Montisola was renowned for the quality of the nets its inhabitants supplied to the local fishing industry, but perhaps the most notable success came when the craftsmen were chosen to supply the netting for the goals at the 1982 football World Cup in Spain. This not only proved to be a stroke of good fortune for the locals but indeed the Italian national team, who went on to lift the trophy. </p> <p>National pride was also evident in Iseo's Piazza Garibaldi, where a statue of the hero of Italian unification who had earlier helped the Lombards in their struggles with neighbouring Austria looked down on the bustling square. But this is not a place that lives in the past, the fashionable boutiques and abundance of restaurants ensuring that visitors are never short of somewhere to spend their money.Naturally, lunch is a serious business. Certainly the expression on the face of the tinca , or tench, sitting on my plate told me this was not a fish to be taken lightly. Tinca can be found in abundance in lake Iseo and they are prepared by stuffing the body with a generous amount of butter, breadcrumbs, and parsley before baking in the oven. A side dish of p olenta bresciana completes the perfect accompaniment to a hearty appetite. Granted, the tinca may not have the looks to grace Marchesi's culinary catwalk, but as we discovered, in this case beauty was most definitely more than skin deep. </p> <p>The same can be said of the grapes that populate the acres of vines visible from L'Albereta, and which go into the production of both the red and white wines from the nearby Bellavista and Contadi Castaldi cantine which grace the tables of Marchesi's restaurant. The respective tour guides dutifully took us through the various processes, well aware, I am sure, that it wasn't our thirst for knowledge that had originally brought us knocking at their door. Even so, we did pay attention, braving the chill of the cellars where the sparkling wines that have had producers in Champagne casting nervous glances in their direction sit maturing in the bottle. There was also an array of fine \" fermos \", or still wines, including Mancapane. This distinctive white takes its name, literally \"lacking bread\", from the fact that the soil in which the vines grow proved to be inadequate for cereal crops but was ideally suited to the vines upon which its chardonnay grapes flourish. </p> <p>Naturally Franciacorta wines were much in evidence during our evening at La Mongolfiera dei Sodi in the nearby town of Erbusco. Tuscan dishes such as onion stuffed with cheese, pappardelle with pigeon, and veal chop gave us ample opportunity to give full rein to our newly-acquired knowledge, although there was healthy competition for the attentions of the sommelier's corkscrew in the shape of some robust Tuscan and Piedmontese reds. </p> <p> One beautiful sunny morning we awoke eager for another slice of the good life, only to realise that three days had flown by and there was only time for a final stroll through the woods and lunch before the car for the airport arrived. We had come in search of pampering, and we had certainly got it: whether it was simply sitting in the hotel garden by the fountain, sipping sparkling wine, watching the more energetic wander down to the tennis court; or relaxing on our balcony overlooking the Lombardy countryside. In truth, it was like stepping into somebody else's life for three days. By the end, I was almost surprised that we hadn't found time to use the helicopter pad; so thoroughly in tune with my surroundings that was I that if someone had leant over to inform me my pilot was ready, I would not have batted an eyelid. Mind you, the chances of us getting off the ground after that not so little tinca in Iseo would have been slim. </p> <p>We descended the steps into the piano bar for the last time, choosing a light lunch of bresaola and parmesan on peppery leaves, ideally suited to a bottle of the Bellavista Rosso Franciacorta. \"Thank you,\" I said to the bartender who had prepared our meat and cheese, \"That was delicious.\"</p> <p>\"I know, sir,\" he said, his wry smile betraying not the merest hint of conceit but of quiet confidence in his own ability.

Mr Marchesi would have been proud of him. Way to go L'Albereta, Via Vittorio Emanuele 11, Erbusco, Brescia Tel: 00 39 030 77 60 550; fax: + 77 60 573; e-mail info@albereta.it.

      "body": "<p>In many ways, a health farm is a strange choice for a luxury weekend away. Why restrict yourself to calorie-counted food and exercise when you could be eating big, rich meals, getting drunk, having a laugh and lolling around - in my experience, a far more successful method of relaxation? </p> <p>Mind you, things appeared a little too relaxed when we arrived at Champneys, Britain's original health farm, having been founded in 1925 by a Latvian naturopath called Stanley Lief, and set in a magnificent manor house in the Chiltern Hills between Berkhamstead and Tring. Everyone was wandering round in towelling robes. Robes! With nothing underneath! In public! At mealtimes! You won't catch us doing that, we muttered. What a bunch of Hugh Hefners. How disturbing. How institution-like. In short, how... weird. </p> <p>Which just goes to show the lure of institutions, because within a few hours we, too, were padding about in our very own slippers and robes, having decided that they really made you feel quite free and were actually rather democratising - everyone looks the same in a Champneys's robe! </p> <p>Soon, we were sharing cheery waves with similarly-robed strangers, and chat ting about \"my Thalgo\" and \"my heat treatment\", and \"the spirit of Champneys\". However did that happen? My friend kept muttering darkly about the Thomas Mann novel, The Magic Mountain, which is set in a pre-war sanatorium in the Alps and where the inmates are seduced into losing all free will. So, we can't say we weren't warned. Even so, we gave in all the same. </p> <p>The most fascinating aspect of our two nights in the Hertfordshire countryside was the food. All meals are included, and you'd better eat them, because you can buy nothing extra to snack on: there's no Coke dispenser, no minibar, no chocolate for at least three miles. There is a bowl of fruit in your room, but it is accompanied by a dire warning to the poor saps on the \"Light Diet\" programme (for weight loss) - they're not even allowed more than one apple a day. </p> <p>The nurse who gave me a check-up told me that on the \"main menu\" (health, not weight loss, being the objective) you won't eat more than 1,500 calories a day. This seemed astounding when I saw what was on offer - fruit, cereal, egg, mushrooms, muffins, for breakfast; salad buffet and chilli for lunch; three-course dinner with swanky vertical layers and things like jus . How could this possibly add up to only 1,500 calories? And then we noticed - brains of Britain - that the \"bread rolls\" were in fact the size of the holes in doughnuts, and that even though you were free to eat as many as you like, you felt greedy having more than two. And we also realised that nothing was cooked in oil; the breakfast muffins were fat-free and constituted one mouthful. </p> <p>Rather more obviously, at lunchtime the plates were adorned, not with a flower design, or willowpattern, but with markings proclaiming \"protein\" (one-third), \"complex carbohydrate\" (one-third) and \"fruit and vegetables\" (the other third). Which I found a little too bossy for my liking. </p> <p>Nevertheless, the food was pretty fantastic under those constraints; but there was something about the place that just made us want to buck the system. So we risked disapproving looks by ordering potatoes (three tiny chunks of boiled spuds), and then, horror of horrors, spent a small fortune on wine; that is, when it was available (dinner only). Disappointingly, there was no bar to retire to. </p> <p>In between eating, there was a surprisingly wide range of things to do. One particularly energetic morning, we played squash and table tennis, went for a swim, tested the indoor Jacuzzi, sat in the outdoor hot tub (we were steaming), and had the heat treatment and massage that is included for every single day of your stay. All before about 3pm. Pretty fabulous. </p> <p>After that, we wafted about in those robes. I had a facial, which involved being blasted with oxygen from a blowtorch, and my friend had a Thalgo Men-Only Treatment, which involved being covered in seaweed and rubbed about a bit. Then we went for a walk in the grounds, wandering past the tennis courts, the croquet lawns and one of those giant chess games where the pieces are the size of small people. The lack of a bar did prove a bit of a hindrance to the kind of evenings we're used to, but the wine with dinner and the rather fantastic games room meant we could while away the time playing backgammon and snooker. And that was all in one day! </p> <p>The next morning, we decided on fewer exertions. I took much longer over my complimentary massage, arriving early for a heat treatment - sitting in a steamy box with your head sticking out, slightly eerie and torture-like - and then being wrapped in towels and blankets and placed in a darkened room. Only then did I get my massage, but it was worth the wait. </p> <p>After this, I went to the arts-and-crafts room. I know, it's a strange idea; and, of course, I had scoffed heartily when the concept had been mentioned on our arrival. But it was a lovely room, bright and airy, with paints and charcoals and pastels. I hadn't fiddled around with that stuff since I was at school. I painted some crocuses, and wandered over to a fantastic place called the music room, which played out some well-chosen classical while you sat silently in comfy chairs. The sun streamed in, and people in robes fell asleep. I loved this room, although there was an alarming moment when I imagined I'd aged 50 years and was in an upmarket nursing home. Then I fell asleep, too. </p> <p>There were a few surprises. The staff were terrific; especially a character called Bryan: \"There are only two rules at Champneys. First: there are no rules. Second: wear slippers at all times,\" he declared. And the fact that you didn't have to lug anything around - there were stacks of towels permanently on hand - helped make the environment particularly relaxing. We felt exceptionally well after our activity-filled, fibre-enhanced weekend, and much less obsessive about Fruit &amp; Nut than we thought we'd be. </p> <p>Or at least I thought we did. On arrival at Euston station, while discussing how our bodies were temples and we were high on health, we stumbled across a Thorntons kiosk on the concourse. Of course, we bought some.

Whereas a night or two in a hotel in Paris or Amsterdam used to fill the gaps between summer holidays very nicely, today's weekend plans are just as likely to involve a dune safari in Dubai, or cruising the Arctic Circle. </p> <p>A Lapland winter weekend is packed with impact. \"A taste of Eskimo living\" is how Arctic Experience (01737 214214) describes its three-night Swedish breaks. You begin in Stockholm with a night on the magnificent yacht Malardrottningen, originally built for a New York millionaire, followed by a night in the Lapland wilderness, being carried by sledge and husky to the base camp where there's an opportunity to drive your own dog team through the forest. The final night is spent in the Ice Hotel in Jukkasjarvi, sleeping on ice beds (reindeer skins provided), eating at ice tables and drinking vodka at the ice bar. The cost of this hedonism? Yours for \u00a3835. </p> <p>Who wants to be a millionaire for three days or so? An Aston Martin DB6, a Jaguar E-Type Roadster or a Triumph Stag will give you a taste of life in the fast, or, rather, not so fast lane and costs from \u00a3250pp for a three-night \"go as you please\" midweek classic car break from the <a href=\"http://www.grandtouringclub.co.uk\">Grand Touring Club</a> (01449 737774). The price includes the hire of one of seven classic cars, comprehensive insurance, 24-hour breakdown cover, advice line and area route books. Accommodation and summer champagne picnics can all be arranged. </p> <p>Water babies suffering winter withdrawal symptoms can swim off for a four-night diving break on the Maltese island of Gozo. Departures are daily with Regal Holidays (0870 2201777) and the breaks cost from \u00a3379pp including flights, half-board and three days' diving. </p> <p>Beirut was once the Paris of the Middle East, but the party was put on hold when it was devastated by war. Now the Lebanese capital has been rebuilt and restored to its former glory. Spend five days sightseeing with Sunvil Holidays (020-8758 4722) visiting the Jeita Caverns, Phoenician Byblos and the ancient ruins of Baalbeck in the Beqaa Valley. The break costs from \u00a3665pp including B&amp;B, flights and English-speaking guided excursions. </p> <p>From a rather exclusive country-house base, Cadogan Holidays (02380 828303) can take you walking the hidden levadas of Madeira. The island is famous for these small irrigation canals with accompanying paths, which extend throughout the mountainous interior, crossing various botanical zones. Three nights at the five-star Casa Velha Do Palheiro near Funchal with its outdoor heated pool, steam room, golf course, tennis court and gorgeous gardens costs from \u00a3454pp including B&amp;B. </p> <p>Still on a rural theme but closer to home, guests at the Gleneagles Hotel in Scotland can try their hand at falconry, horse riding, and even shooting on the hotel's extensive estate.

Whereas a night or two in a hotel in Paris or Amsterdam used to fill the gaps between summer holidays very nicely, today's weekend plans are just as likely to involve a dune safari in Dubai, or cruising the Arctic Circle. A Lapland winter weekend is packed with impact. \"A taste of Eskimo living\" is how Arctic Experience (01737 214214) describes its three-night Swedish breaks. You begin in Stockholm with a night on the magnificent yacht Malardrottningen, originally built for a New York millionaire, followed by a night in the Lapland wilderness, being carried by sledge and husky to the base camp where there's an opportunity to drive your own dog team through the forest. The final night is spent in the Ice Hotel in Jukkasjarvi, sleeping on ice beds (reindeer skins provided), eating at ice tables and drinking vodka at the ice bar. The cost of this hedonism? Yours for \u00a3835. Who wants to be a millionaire for three days or so? An Aston Martin DB6, a Jaguar E-Type Roadster or a Triumph Stag will give you a taste of life in the fast, or, rather, not so fast lane and costs from \u00a3250pp for a three-night \"go as you please\" midweek classic car break from the Grand Touring Club (01449 737774). The price includes the hire of one of seven classic cars, comprehensive insurance, 24-hour breakdown cover, advice line and area route books. Accommodation and summer champagne picnics can all be arranged. Water babies suffering winter withdrawal symptoms can swim off for a four-night diving break on the Maltese island of Gozo. Departures are daily with Regal Holidays (0870 2201777) and the breaks cost from \u00a3379pp including flights, half-board and three days' diving. Beirut was once the Paris of the Middle East, but the party was put on hold when it was devastated by war. Now the Lebanese capital has been rebuilt and restored to its former glory. Spend five days sightseeing with Sunvil Holidays (020-8758 4722) visiting the Jeita Caverns, Phoenician Byblos and the ancient ruins of Baalbeck in the Beqaa Valley. The break costs from \u00a3665pp including B&amp;B, flights and English-speaking guided excursions. From a rather exclusive country-house base, Cadogan Holidays (02380 828303) can take you walking the hidden levadas of Madeira. The island is famous for these small irrigation canals with accompanying paths, which extend throughout the mountainous interior, crossing various botanical zones. Three nights at the five-star Casa Velha Do Palheiro near Funchal with its outdoor heated pool, steam room, golf course, tennis court and gorgeous gardens costs from \u00a3454pp including B&amp;B. Still on a rural theme but closer to home, guests at the Gleneagles Hotel in Scotland can try their hand at falconry, horse riding, and even shooting on the hotel's extensive estate. No stay would be complete without a round of golf on one of its three famous courses. Children are well catered for and can even enrol for golf tuition with the resident pro.

      "body": "<p>Greenwich Park, 9.30am. Some mistake, surely. No rhinos, no wombles, no noisome loos with queues. Nothing but squirrels and daffodils. This couldn't be the London Marathon. </p> <p>Well, no, and then again sort of. With the foot-and-mouth epidemic drastically curtailing rural walking, the Long Distance Walkers Association has put together a programme of urban alternatives and this is one of them: Walk The Route Of The London Marathon. </p> <p>Tomorrow the race itself will take place over the same roads, give a few twists and turns, as the one devised by its founders Chris Brasher and John Disley 21 years ago - 26.2 miles of Tarmac that, using the Thames as a handrail, links London in all its variety. You pass through suburbs, docklands, city and riverfront before fetching up in weary, blistered triumph just beyond the gates of Buckingham Palace. Along the way, the route goes from the sublime (Greenwich, the Versailles of London) to the bibulous - it boasts 76 pubs. </p> <p>But I've run the London four times now and have barely glanced at any of it. When you are sharing the city streets with 35,000 others, funnelling through lines of spectators with salt crusts on your eyebrows and swordthrusts of pain in your limbs, all you want to see is the next mile marker. Walking the route would give the chance to put a name to all those blurred mental images and \"where-am-I?\" moments. </p> <p>Turning our backs on the springlike splendours of Greenwich Park, we set off through the gates into Charlton Way where faded paint markings on the kerbstones record the previous years' start lines. The route of the mass start (serious runners take a separate course for the first three miles) took us towards Charlton past pleasant suburban semis with assiduously-tended gardens. On the outskirts is Charlton House, enshrined permanently in London Marathon history as the place where in 1999 two runners left the course, sprinted into the newly-opened registry office, got married and after a swig of champagne rejoined the race. </p> <p>Charlton Village itself is a prettily old-fashioned main street leading to the marathon's only Alp, Hill Reach. This steepish yomp levels out at Artillery Place where, behind the barbed-wire-topped walls of Ministry of Defence property, sits one of south-east London's most curious buildings, a mysterious green structure like a giant artichoke. After this is another personal high point of the marathon, the left turn into the downhill racetrack of John Wilson Street, where the two starts converge to unite world champions with Pink Panthers and 13ft giraffes. </p> <p>The road from Woolwich back to Greenwich is a dull, traffic-blighted stretch, though the pedestrian walkway took us high enough to afford a splendid view of the river. You could, if you wished, go off-piste here and join the riverside walkway that is the scenic route back to Greenwich. But we were purists, following the blue line now marked out every year by Hugh Jones, Official Course Measurer and still the only Londoner ever to have won the race. On we yomped along exhaust-scented Woolwich Road and under the cacophonous flyover of the Blackwall Tunnel approach into Trafalgar Road. </p> <p>Six miles into the route, this is the most spectacular section, with the National Maritime Museum to the left and the old Royal Naval College to the right. Turning right into King William Walk led us to the Cutty Sark. With pubs, caf\u00e9s, open-air seating and views of the busy river, it was the ideal place to make the first tea-and-pee stop. Even taking it at a walk, doing the marathon was thirsty work. </p> <p>The route sidesteps the very centre of Greenwich. Regretfully, we passed up the charms of the covered market, St Alfege Church and elegant Crooms Hill, which has blue plaques on its walls like other streets have satellite dishes. Instead, we headed up Creek Road towards the KFC-and-car-auction belt where Deptford meets Surrey Quays. Nine miles was just coming up on the tripmeter when, just before Rotherhithe, the route made a couple of loops and shimmies. With its silent apartments and houses, this has always been the Mars of the marathon route - is there actually life out there? </p> <p>Along Salter Road, the dark green paintwork of the old Adam and Eve pub marked our return to civilisation, or at least the maelstrom of the traffic roundabout by the Rotherhithe Tunnel. From here it was a long, easy canter along cheerful Jamaica Road towards Tower Bridge. We were nearly at the halfway mark. Hurrah! </p> <p>By way of celebration, we deviated from the route to refuel on the waterfront by Shad Thames, which offers an extensive choice of eateries for the ravenous pavement-pounder. </p> <p>Pausing only to apply blister plasters while it was still possible to emancipate my feet from my trainers without needing a local anaesthetic, I followed the charge up the narrow flight of stone steps that took us up to Tower Bridge. In the marathon this is when you cross over the river for the first time into a city magically free of cars and, coming on the brink of the 13-mile mark, it has a famously high blubbing rating. Walking the route, you just don't experience that emotional high, or perhaps I'd just had too much lager. </p> <p>From Tower Bridge, we turned right into The Highway. It's a contentious part of the marathon, this. The route was changed in 1999, with the dual carriageway being run in both directions. The result is that the slower part of the pack heading off towards Docklands section meets the faster part of the pack head ing back again, seven miles further on into the race. For the slower participant, this is a moment of desolation and bilious envy. It is a pretty grim road to walk down, too, so we took the pre-99 route, turning left and heading up Dock Street, then right into Cable Street. Narrow, dreamy, it's banked on one side by a raised, pillared section of the DLR. It felt as ever like a tiny oasis of Parisianness. </p> <p>Not for long, alas. Bearing left at Butcher Row, we found ourselves in the dusty, noisy stretch of Commercial Road and East India Dock Road before sidling off towards the borders of Docklands and picking up Poplar High Street. Like Cable Street, it was an oasis. Approaching mile 16, we were about to confront the savagery of the traffic interchange at Aspen Way. </p> <p>We braced ourselves with a comfort stop at the drive-in McDonald's before Trafalgar Way led us to the upmarket building site that is currently Canary Wharf - well-manicured, windswept, under-populated, dominated by architecture. It was a relief to get back to human scale with Marsh Wall, despite the fact that this and East Ferry Road can be one of the most dismal parts of the route if you're running it. At walking pace, you become aware of the sheer pleasantness of this environment, the wide avenues and swatches of green, the careful planning and tree-planting. </p> <p>It was time for one of those \"where-am-I?\" moments. As we turned sharp right to head back up Westferry Road, I had no recollection of ever having been on this part of the course. I then realised that for four successive years I had run it through a tunnel of people. Without the little old ladies doling out jelly-babies and the kids giving high-fives, it looked completely different. Now it was just a silent, tired march along a sliver of old Docklands. </p> <p>We were about to notch up mile 20, our reward for negotiating one of the most hideous parts of the route. The underground roundabout of Westferry Circus is where you run from sunlight and air into a Hadean darkness, where the surface is sticky with oil and spilt drink. They try and cheer you up by playing the London Marathon theme tune over the PA system, which just makes everybody burst into tears. Unscathed, we emerged into the daylight to head for Limehouse Causeway and Narrow Street, another of the route's lovelier parts where we stopped for tea at Booty's, with its terrace overlooking the river. </p> <p>We rejoined The Highway, where the noise and violence of the traffic was almost shocking after the tranquil yomp through Docklands. We fled to the safety of Thomas More Street and from there St Katharine's Way, crowded with tourists to give an accurate simulation of race-day conditions. We survived the famous cobbles which, after travelling 22 miles on foot, are no shag-pile experience, whatever pace you take it at. </p> <p>The last few miles take you along Lower and Upper Thames Street to Blackfriars underpass, indelibly marked in my memory as the place where I was humiliated by a speeding rhino in 1997. We followed the riverside path to avoid the speeding traffic and emerged on to Victoria Embankment. In the distance, Big Ben was still wearing that mocking face, as if to say, \"You thought you were nearly there, didn't you? Tough.\" </p> <p>It was strange to reach Westminster Bridge and turn down Great George Street into Birdcage Walk without the sound of the PA system booming out over the park, talking the runners in. As in the marathon itself, the last half mile seemed endless, and after a journey on foot of 26 miles I was aware of Buckingham Palace only as a rather big house on a corner. </p> <p>It was 6.30pm when we stood in The Mall, trying to work out exactly where the finish line was. There were no medals, of course. Strangely, though, as I hobbled off towards Charing Cross, I had that familiar old feeling that I had just mastered London and made it belong to me.</p> <p><strong>Way to go</strong></p> <p>A map of the course is available at <a href=\"http://www.london-marathon.co.uk\">www.london-marathon.co.uk</a>. <a href=\"http://www.ldwa.org.uk\">LDWA</a>: Membership secretary Janet Chapman, 63 Yockley Close, The Maultway, Camberley, Surrey GU15 1QQ (tel: 01276 65169, e-mail: <a href=\"mailto:RegChapman@compuserve.com\">RegChapman@compuserve.com</a>)</p>",

After this is another personal high point of the marathon, the left turn into the downhill racetrack of John Wilson Street, where the two starts converge to unite world champions with Pink Panthers and 13ft giraffes. The road from Woolwich back to Greenwich is a dull, traffic-blighted stretch, though the pedestrian walkway took us high enough to afford a splendid view of the river. You could, if you wished, go off-piste here and join the riverside walkway that is the scenic route back to Greenwich. But we were purists, following the blue line now marked out every year by Hugh Jones, Official Course Measurer and still the only Londoner ever to have won the race. On we yomped along exhaust-scented Woolwich Road and under the cacophonous flyover of the Blackwall Tunnel approach into Trafalgar Road. Six miles into the route, this is the most spectacular section, with the National Maritime Museum to the left and the old Royal Naval College to the right. Turning right into King William Walk led us to the Cutty Sark. With pubs, caf\u00e9s, open-air seating and views of the busy river, it was the ideal place to make the first tea-and-pee stop. Even taking it at a walk, doing the marathon was thirsty work. The route sidesteps the very centre of Greenwich. Regretfully, we passed up the charms of the covered market, St Alfege Church and elegant Crooms Hill, which has blue plaques on its walls like other streets have satellite dishes. Instead, we headed up Creek Road towards the KFC-and-car-auction belt where Deptford meets Surrey Quays. Nine miles was just coming up on the tripmeter when, just before Rotherhithe, the route made a couple of loops and shimmies. With its silent apartments and houses, this has always been the Mars of the marathon route - is there actually life out there? Along Salter Road, the dark green paintwork of the old Adam and Eve pub marked our return to civilisation, or at least the maelstrom of the traffic roundabout by the Rotherhithe Tunnel. From here it was a long, easy canter along cheerful Jamaica Road towards Tower Bridge. We were nearly at the halfway mark. Hurrah! By way of celebration, we deviated from the route to refuel on the waterfront by Shad Thames, which offers an extensive choice of eateries for the ravenous pavement-pounder. Pausing only to apply blister plasters while it was still possible to emancipate my feet from my trainers without needing a local anaesthetic, I followed the charge up the narrow flight of stone steps that took us up to Tower Bridge. In the marathon this is when you cross over the river for the first time into a city magically free of cars and, coming on the brink of the 13-mile mark, it has a famously high blubbing rating. Walking the route, you just don't experience that emotional high, or perhaps I'd just had too much lager. From Tower Bridge, we turned right into The Highway. It's a contentious part of the marathon, this. The route was changed in 1999, with the dual carriageway being run in both directions. The result is that the slower part of the pack heading off towards Docklands section meets the faster part of the pack head ing back again, seven miles further on into the race. For the slower participant, this is a moment of desolation and bilious envy. It is a pretty grim road to walk down, too, so we took the pre-99 route, turning left and heading up Dock Street, then right into Cable Street. Narrow, dreamy, it's banked on one side by a raised, pillared section of the DLR. It felt as ever like a tiny oasis of Parisianness. Not for long, alas. Bearing left at Butcher Row, we found ourselves in the dusty, noisy stretch of Commercial Road and East India Dock Road before sidling off towards the borders of Docklands and picking up Poplar High Street. Like Cable Street, it was an oasis. Approaching mile 16, we were about to confront the savagery of the traffic interchange at Aspen Way. We braced ourselves with a comfort stop at the drive-in McDonald's before Trafalgar Way led us to the upmarket building site that is currently Canary Wharf - well-manicured, windswept, under-populated, dominated by architecture. It was a relief to get back to human scale with Marsh Wall, despite the fact that this and East Ferry Road can be one of the most dismal parts of the route if you're running it. At walking pace, you become aware of the sheer pleasantness of this environment, the wide avenues and swatches of green, the careful planning and tree-planting. It was time for one of those \"where-am-I?\" moments. As we turned sharp right to head back up Westferry Road, I had no recollection of ever having been on this part of the course. I then realised that for four successive years I had run it through a tunnel of people. Without the little old ladies doling out jelly-babies and the kids giving high-fives, it looked completely different. Now it was just a silent, tired march along a sliver of old Docklands. We were about to notch up mile 20, our reward for negotiating one of the most hideous parts of the route. The underground roundabout of Westferry Circus is where you run from sunlight and air into a Hadean darkness, where the surface is sticky with oil and spilt drink. They try and cheer you up by playing the London Marathon theme tune over the PA system, which just makes everybody burst into tears. Unscathed, we emerged into the daylight to head for Limehouse Causeway and Narrow Street, another of the route's lovelier parts where we stopped for tea at Booty's, with its terrace overlooking the river. We rejoined The Highway, where the noise and violence of the traffic was almost shocking after the tranquil yomp through Docklands. We fled to the safety of Thomas More Street and from there St Katharine's Way, crowded with tourists to give an accurate simulation of race-day conditions. We survived the famous cobbles which, after travelling 22 miles on foot, are no shag-pile experience, whatever pace you take it at. The last few miles take you along Lower and Upper Thames Street to Blackfriars underpass, indelibly marked in my memory as the place where I was humiliated by a speeding rhino in 1997. We followed the riverside path to avoid the speeding traffic and emerged on to Victoria Embankment. In the distance, Big Ben was still wearing that mocking face, as if to say, \"You thought you were nearly there, didn't you? Tough.\" It was strange to reach Westminster Bridge and turn down Great George Street into Birdcage Walk without the sound of the PA system booming out over the park, talking the runners in. As in the marathon itself, the last half mile seemed endless, and after a journey on foot of 26 miles I was aware of Buckingham Palace only as a rather big house on a corner. It was 6.30pm when we stood in The Mall, trying to work out exactly where the finish line was. There were no medals, of course. Strangely, though, as I hobbled off towards Charing Cross, I had that familiar old feeling that I had just mastered London and made it belong to me.

      "body": "<p>As Saturday night gin and tonics go, it wasn't up to much - barely enough ice and in a plastic cup. But the situation was unbeatable and still, a month later, barely credible. We were standing under a velvet African sky, dotted with countless stars, beside a Land Rover in a game reserve, having spent the previous 45 minutes in the company of a leopard. </p> <p>It had been lump-in-the-throat time as the beautiful animal, seemingly oblivious to the three vehicles around it, had padded though the bush, growling occasionally. We had found her in the light of the evening and stayed with her until it was pitch black. Cameras whirred as Zane, our driver, pulled the vehicle backwards and forwards so that everyone could get a good view. But the best thing was to just sit and watch. </p> <p>And, afterwards, when she had faded into the darkness and we got down and sipped our G&amp;Ts, we all agreed they had been some of the most wonderful moments of our lives. Zane and Doc, the tracker who sat on a seat suspended in front of the bonnet like bait, said we had been incredibly lucky. Leopards are rare and, normally, extremely shy. </p> <p>It was the highlight of the ultimate four-day weekend in South Africa, one that was manageable because of overnight flights both ways and only a two-hour time difference - meaning there is no Jetlag. As long as you can sleep on a plane, you feel fine. </p> <p>So it was that 14 hours after leaving Heathrow on a Thursday evening, we were cruising out of Skukuza airport in the Kruger National Park, a 75-minute hop from Johannesburg. Within 30 seconds, we came across a troop of baboons sitting on the road, then some impala scuttled across. We all raced for our cameras only to be told by the driver not to get excited as there would be no shortage of baboons, impala, or anything else. And, besides, impala were lunch for the predators so we shouldn't get too attached. </p> <p>Skukuza is in the southern part of the Kruger, a game park the size of Wales that was set up more than 100 years ago and is home to 147 mammal, 507 bird, 114 reptile and 34 amphibian species. It is fenced all the way round. There are camps inside the limits, with shops, restaurants and chalets where you can stay (gated at night to keep the predators out), but we were heading out for the evening to a small town called Hazyview in Mpumalanga. </p> <p>People who know the continent say that South Africa is not the real thing because it has the veneer of a first-world infrastructure, like metalled roads and telephones that work. But for a weekend visit, where you cannot afford for anything to go wrong, these are real bonuses. </p> <p>At Hazyview, we stayed the night at Hippo Hollow, a low-key hotel with chalets overlooking the Sabi river. My room was large with a balcony, a gas braai (barby) and a large shower room. The Sabi looked pretty tame but last year the rain that did for Mozambique to the east turned all the rivers around here into huge monsters, and most of the bridges were torn down. The hippos, which used to roam the hotel gardens, went elsewhere, too, but it is hoped they will return when the river gets back to normal. </p> <p>That night we went to one of those cultural \"evening\" experiences that had all the makings of being naff and barely got away with it. This area is home to the Shangana people, and they have built a traditional-style working village near Hazyview. As the sun set behind the mountains, the drums beat and the singers and dancers arrived in a torch-lit procession at Chief Soshangana's krall. </p> <p>The choir and dancers told the story of the Shangaan people, which took a while because it had to be translated into Japanese, Dutch and Spanish as well as English. The best bit was a dance by men wearing hard hats and wellingtons - these were the ones who had headed south to work in the gold mines - and it involved lots of slapping of the wellies and the hats. Swap the kits for lederhosen, felt hats and sturdy shoes, and you get the picture. At the end of the evening, as the fire died down, the choir sang the new national anthem. Lump in the throat time again. </p> <p>The next day, Saturday, we headed about an hour out and into the Sabi Sand game reserve, which borders the Kruger and is virtually a part of it. You have to be staying in one of the fabulous lodges to get in,but while this pushed up the price of the trip, staying has it rewards. For, unlike the Kruger, the guides can go off road and so get very close to the game. We stopped for lunch at the Leopard Hills reserve, perched on top of a hill with views over the bush and beautifully-appointed rooms that could have been the set for Out of Africa De Luxe. We went on a game walk with a guide. He had a gun but when we asked what to do if anything made a beeline for us, he smiled and said, \"Run.\" </p> <p>We saw a couple of elephants at a water hole about 100 metres away, larking about and spraying themselves before ambling off. And there were zebra, impala and kudu, the ones that seem to have a bullseye stuck on their backside. </p> <p>That afternoon we travelled on to Bush Lodge in Sabi Sabi Private Game Reserve, where each suite is its own thatched cottage with bathrooms the size of most people's living rooms, huge beds and patios where you can sit out on a colonial- style chair and watch the action at the waterhole about 50m away across a dried-up river bed. There was an outside shower, so I had one looked on only by an elephant. Maybe he was comparing size. </p> <p>After the evening drive and the leopard sighting, we ate roast impala and crocodile (which tastes like chicken) and drank too much wine and listened to the guides making up stories of derring-do. Everyone was in bed quite early because the morning game drive sets off at 6am, to catch the animals before they bed down for the day. So, as the sun rose over the bushveld, we saw giraffes and zebras, three lions posing around a tree as if they were extras in Born Free, and then three elephants making a meal out of a couple of trees. They turned toward us and made as if to charge. In fact they didn't, but Zane said we had better move on. </p> <p>Later that morning, we drove west out of the park and up into a completely different landscape and temperature. The 40km drive from Hazyview to Graskop took us up 1,000m, through vast commercial eucalyptus forests, to the top of the Drakensburg Escarpment, where there were great views back over the low veld, especially from a spot aptly named God's Window. </p> <p>The main street of Graskop could almost be a laid-back small town in northern California - wide street, pretty houses, nothing much happening. We had lunch at Harrie's Pancakes, where one, filled with chicken and mushrooms, cost 25 rand (less than \u00a32.50) and a bottle of South African chardonnay just over \u00a33. The place, apparently, is recommended by Jo'burg's Chosen Few motorcycle gang. The roads around here would be perfect for touring on a bike. </p> <p>The state of the rand may be desperate for South Africans but it makes anything locally sourced extremely cheap for Brits. In Graskop, at the factory where they make Rogue shoes and belts, I bought a pair of tough desert boots for around \u00a320 and a lined buffalo belt for \u00a35. </p> <p>The countryside around here was green, dotted with spectacular waterfalls, and the road was lined with thousands upon thousands of wild white lilies. We were heading up to goldrush country and the town of Pilgrims Rest. It was here, in 1873, that the first major goldrush in the country happened, before they started gouging out the innards of Johannesburg, hundreds of kilometres to the west. When the gold finally ran out in 1972 the village - all corrugated iron painted cream with red roofs - was sold to the government as a ready-made museum and it has now become a national monument. It is very pretty - a row of houses strung along a road in a lonely valley. The population had reached a few thousand by the time the last mine closed. Now it is down to a few hundred who make their living from tourism. The main street has caf\u00e9s, tourist shops and a few houses which are now museums to Victorian living and gold mining. </p> <p>We stayed at the Royal Hotel, a Victorian place with the rooms off a quiet courtyard, which had the look and feel of a hotel from the Australian Outback. In fact, it used to be the chapel of a girl's school in Cape Town which was dismantled and shipped to Mozambique before being brought here by ox wagon. </p> <p>The next morning, I was up early and walked to the cemetery where many of the names told the story of those who had headed out from the old country, and particularly Wales, to dig for gold. One, Saul Sampson, had died of starvation, while several others, out of luck, committed suicide. One grave dominates - the Robber's Grave. It is that of an unknown man convicted of tent robbing in the goldfields. He was banished but a few days after his trial he was spotted on a hill, now known as Cemtery Hill, where he was shot dead and then buried. His grave was orientated north-south, while all the others were west-east, to brand him a thief forever. Now, here he lies with all the others, looking down the valley. On a quiet sunny morning, it was as fine a place as any to end up. </p> <p>Monday morning, we had to be heading back to Skukuza for the flight to Jo'burg. A couple of giraffe languidly picking at some leaves and a glimpse of a few more impala represented our last look at game. It seemed like a week since we had walked off the place into the arrivals lounge - in reality a couple of tables with thatched umbrellas - to be met by our driver in his khaki shirt and shorts. </p> <p>Back in Jo'burg, we finished off the weekend with a trip around Soweto, the suburb of four million people which was at the centre of the struggle against apartheid. It's an uneasy tour, with a local driver, around a place which is not much to look at. There are the shanty towns which, from the comfort of a minbus bigger than most of the shacks, makes you feel guilty. There is a middle-class area and there is mile upon mile of small houses. There is no centre - everyone travels out to work in a minibus - but the most interesting street is that which was has the present-day house of Bishop Tutu and the old one of Nelson Mandela, now a museum run by his former wife Winnie, whose heavily-fortified house is nearby. As the driver said proudly, there is nowhere else in the world where there are the homes of two Nobel Prize winners in one street. </p> <p>The museum, in a one-bedroom bungalow, was very low key, cost about 50p to enter, and was full of Mandela memorabilia. Afterwards, we were asked if we wanted to give money to Winnie's charities. </p> <p>We stopped for a beer in Wandie's, a bar for locals and tourists in Soweto to which most of the guides take you, and then we headed back to the airport and London. </p> <p>By Tuesday morning, I was back in the office. Where had I been for the weekend? Refer to the above. It had been a sensation.</p> <p><strong>The practicals</strong></p> <p>Charles Burgess' trip was organised by Quest Travel (0870 4445552) and cost \u00a31,205pp; but with its ground agent, Thompsons, it can provide any combination and arrange stays in Kruger camps. The breakdown was as follows: SAA flights from Heathrow to Johannesburg from \u00a3487 (valid to July 15) and domestic return from Jo'burg to Skukuza \u00a388. Accommodation at Hippo Hollow \u00a322pp per night twin share, B&amp;B only. Game drives \u00a339 for a morning. Stay two nights and the third free during May and June. (Leopard Hills \u00a3225pp a night twin share, full board, and two game drives. Stay three nights and get the fourth night free). Sabi Sabi Reserve Bush Lodge \u00a3390pp a night twin share full board and two games drives per day. Pilgrim's Rest \u00a327pp a night, B&amp;B only. Transfers Skukuza-Hippo Hollow-Sabi Sabi-Pilgrim's Rest-Skukuza: \u00a3131pp (based on min two people). A half-day Soweto tour costs \u00a321. (Car hire is available from \u00a316 a day based on group A car with 100% insurance).</p> <p><strong>Ultimate weekends</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://travel.guardianunlimited.co.uk/weekenders/story/0,7454,475812,00.html\">Dream tickets</a> <br>The Ice Hotel in Lapland, shopping in Dubai, or perhaps touring Britain in an Aston Martin DB6.

We stayed at the Royal Hotel, a Victorian place with the rooms off a quiet courtyard, which had the look and feel of a hotel from the Australian Outback. In fact, it used to be the chapel of a girl's school in Cape Town which was dismantled and shipped to Mozambique before being brought here by ox wagon. The next morning, I was up early and walked to the cemetery where many of the names told the story of those who had headed out from the old country, and particularly Wales, to dig for gold. One, Saul Sampson, had died of starvation, while several others, out of luck, committed suicide. One grave dominates - the Robber's Grave. It is that of an unknown man convicted of tent robbing in the goldfields. He was banished but a few days after his trial he was spotted on a hill, now known as Cemtery Hill, where he was shot dead and then buried. His grave was orientated north-south, while all the others were west-east, to brand him a thief forever. Now, here he lies with all the others, looking down the valley. On a quiet sunny morning, it was as fine a place as any to end up. Monday morning, we had to be heading back to Skukuza for the flight to Jo'burg. A couple of giraffe languidly picking at some leaves and a glimpse of a few more impala represented our last look at game. It seemed like a week since we had walked off the place into the arrivals lounge - in reality a couple of tables with thatched umbrellas - to be met by our driver in his khaki shirt and shorts. Back in Jo'burg, we finished off the weekend with a trip around Soweto, the suburb of four million people which was at the centre of the struggle against apartheid. It's an uneasy tour, with a local driver, around a place which is not much to look at. There are the shanty towns which, from the comfort of a minbus bigger than most of the shacks, makes you feel guilty. There is a middle-class area and there is mile upon mile of small houses. There is no centre - everyone travels out to work in a minibus - but the most interesting street is that which was has the present-day house of Bishop Tutu and the old one of Nelson Mandela, now a museum run by his former wife Winnie, whose heavily-fortified house is nearby. As the driver said proudly, there is nowhere else in the world where there are the homes of two Nobel Prize winners in one street. The museum, in a one-bedroom bungalow, was very low key, cost about 50p to enter, and was full of Mandela memorabilia. Afterwards, we were asked if we wanted to give money to Winnie's charities. We stopped for a beer in Wandie's, a bar for locals and tourists in Soweto to which most of the guides take you, and then we headed back to the airport and London. By Tuesday morning, I was back in the office. Where had I been for the weekend? Refer to the above. It had been a sensation. The practicals Charles Burgess' trip was organised by Quest Travel (0870 4445552) and cost \u00a31,205pp; but with its ground agent, Thompsons, it can provide any combination and arrange stays in Kruger camps. The breakdown was as follows: SAA flights from Heathrow to Johannesburg from \u00a3487 (valid to July 15) and domestic return from Jo'burg to Skukuza \u00a388. Accommodation at Hippo Hollow \u00a322pp per night twin share, B&amp;B only. Game drives \u00a339 for a morning. Stay two nights and the third free during May and June. (Leopard Hills \u00a3225pp a night twin share, full board, and two game drives. Stay three nights and get the fourth night free). Sabi Sabi Reserve Bush Lodge \u00a3390pp a night twin share full board and two games drives per day. Pilgrim's Rest \u00a327pp a night, B&amp;B only. Transfers Skukuza-Hippo Hollow-Sabi Sabi-Pilgrim's Rest-Skukuza: \u00a3131pp (based on min two people). A half-day Soweto tour costs \u00a321. (Car hire is available from \u00a316 a day based on group A car with 100% insurance).

      "body": "<p>On the main drag in Fuengirola on the Costa del Sol - a sorry litany of caf\u00e9s, bars, estate agents and shoe shops - there's a tired sign on the wall of an alley that announces The Sportsman's Bar. From within the dismal portals comes the drone of racecourse commentators, with all the news that you might want to know about the horses running at Wolverhampton, or Kelso, or Newton Abbot. It's a kind of souped-up betting shop on the Costa del Crime, with the Racing Channel on the television and a well-stocked bar for solace. </p> <p>But it would be an unlucky punter who found himself lured there on a Sunday, since just a couple of miles up the road, in the foothills behind Mijas Costa, there is a spectacular new racecourse overlooking the sun-spangled sea, with all the promise of Brighton Rock and any amount of men in dark glasses muttering from the side of their mouths. </p> <p>The Hipodromo Costa del Sol is the brainchild of Antonio Maldonado, for 18 years the first mayor of Mijas after the death of General Franco. A mind-boggling \u00a324 million has been poured into the project, eventually to cover 250 acres of land with villas, hotels, shops and almost anything else that can be fitted on it. But the hub of the enterprise is the racecourse, to which all are invited for free every Sunday - even on an ordinary day 2,500 people turn up for the craic. </p> <p>And a craic it is, since there's a distinct Irish brogue to many of the voices at the track, along with the English, so that, as in Ireland, there's none of the benighted snobbery that can sometimes plague a day at the races in Blighty. Not that there's an absence of competition at the track; there are plenty of cabals at the tables on the terrace. At first they seem formidable, but it's a false impression, since their members appear as comfortable with strangers as they do with their confederates. </p> <p>The members' bar on the terrace, at the moment no larger than a tennis court, overlooks the broad promenade, with palm trees rustling in the breeze, that fronts the track, the winners enclosure and the paddock. Entrance to this eyrie is perhaps the one undemocratic idiosyncrasy of the track; it lies in the gift of the president of the Hipodromo, Se\u00f1or Maldonado, though what policy of selection his office uses is not revealed. Owners, would-be owners, trainers and jockeys take their ease there, as well as sundry onlookers whose role it might be as well not to ask. </p> <p>In due course, the grandstand proper will be built, a state-of-the-art edifice for 5,000 spectators with corporate and private boxes fit for Royal Ascot. But for the minute, the relaxed atmosphere of the terrace induces a languor unthreatened by the promised grandeur of the architect's plans. </p> <p>Looking over the edge of the terrace at the horses in the paddock before the first race was a large man in an elegant double-breasted suit. He looked like Michael Caine before he assumes his threatening role. He looked promising. In fact he was affable and helpful, involved in construction in the Midlands. He knew his way about the formbook and gave the impression, which he did nothing to dispel when asked, that he might be able to accommodate a \"commission\". Damon Runyan would have called him a sportsman. </p> <p>Diverted by a drunk at an inappropriate moment, I never got to know his selection for the race and, being non-plussed by the form in the racecard, I got it wrong. One man who had clearly not was Norman Jones, triumphantly accepting the winner's trophy, alongside his trainer, Peter Haley. Norman bounded up the steps to the terrace with his fake bronze statuette, apparently the very least of his gains on the race. He explained that he was the manager of the David Nicholls Racing Club in Spain, which forms syndicates of owners to race horses at the track. He explained a great deal more, but it was the kind of stuff a man needs to know before the race. </p> <p>At one table on the terrace was John Reid, the international jockey for the big occasion, checking out the track while on a golfing holiday (complete with dark glasses); at another Robin Wakelam, a horse transport groom who last year shipped the British showjumping team to Sydney. With him was Lester McGarrity, the Irish ex-champion jockey of Belgium and now a horse dentist, who incidentally speaks seven languages (including horse). </p> <p>Beaming at the alfresco delights was Frank Fallon, who owns the famed Red House pub outside Dublin on the Naas Road - his son has it now. \"He's put me out to grass,\" said Frank, while admitting that he keeps his hand in on the Costa del Sol with his O'Brien's Bar in Fuengirola. </p> <p>In fact we'd been there the night before to meet Eddie Creighton, the Irish trainer, to get the SP on the racecourse. He trains 50 horses in one of the 10 American barns built so far at the track. He came to Mijas 15 months ago with his wife, Catherine, and seven children, and a horsebox full of hope, after an honourable career as travelling head lad to Michael Kauntz and the late, great, Tom Costello in Ireland. Now he has a full team working for him (including offspring), with the classic-winning Irish jockey Warren O'Connor and Alan Mackay riding for the stable. </p> <p>From Creighton's barn there is a walk up to the plateau of sea-sand, one-mile track, where various horses were exercising. Two days before the race meeting, there were few who were doing serious work (or gallops), since hopefully they were fit enough by then. Pipe-opening canters were the order of the day. The big four-year-old I was on needed no more then a hack once round the track and then another at an easy canter. </p> <p>Alone, we wandered round to the far side of the track, with the sea glistening below us. It seemed like the brightest spring morning on the Sussex Downs, the air clean and lucid, the colt at one moment gazing out over the Mediterranean and then up to the snow-capped mountains above, his ears flicking like radar. </p> <p>Se\u00f1or Jose Joan Abrines is the managing director of the Hipodromo track. His CV reads interestingly for a man employed in a \u00a324m racing venture on the Costa del Sol, including three years with the American Embassy press office in London and two years with the Central Office of Information at the Foreign Office in London. </p> <p> Since the idea of a local council in Britain spending such huge sums on a racetrack seems a far-fetched social enterprise, it was as well to ask the justification for this jamboree.

The gist of it was that they would all be better off. And if they can develop the track in the manner of, for instance, Del Mar in California - \"Where the turf meets the surf\" - then he's right. It certainly looks the part. </p> <p>Se\u00f1or Abrines is both urbane and refreshingly frank about the perceived evils of illegal gambling and the wide boys that a new racetrack will attract. \"The days of the East End villains on the Costa del Crime are dying out. They're all at least 70 years old and dying to go home,\" he said. \"We've had approaches from English 'entrepreneurs', as they call themselves, but they never seem to want to put anything in. They just want to take it out.\" </p> <p>It's a sad reflection on the local perception of the Englishman abroad, but then, they're not all like that.

Brussels sprouts have stunk their last until next Christmas. Great green shoots of purple sprouting broccoli are the hippest veg right now. Treat them as you would asparagus and don't even think of using a fork. This is what we mean now when we talk about finger food. Get everything into boiling water as quick as you can, asparagus and purple sprouting wait for no one. </p> <p>Learn to make the perfect hollandaise, you'll need it for dunking all the season's green shoots and for the wild salmon too. But if beating egg yolks and butter over hot water till thick enough to stand on the end of your asparagus sounds like too much work, try this instead; while your vegetables boil in deep, salted water, finely grate hard pecorino or Parmesan onto warm plates.

      "bodyText": "Suddenly there is a new energy. Paper bundles of English asparagus, so fresh and perky they could be still growing, have replaced the boxes of wizened roots at the greengrocers. Brussels sprouts have stunk their last until next Christmas. Great green shoots of purple sprouting broccoli are the hippest veg right now. Treat them as you would asparagus and don't even think of using a fork. This is what we mean now when we talk about finger food. Get everything into boiling water as quick as you can, asparagus and purple sprouting wait for no one. Learn to make the perfect hollandaise, you'll need it for dunking all the season's green shoots and for the wild salmon too. But if beating egg yolks and butter over hot water till thick enough to stand on the end of your asparagus sounds like too much work, try this instead; while your vegetables boil in deep, salted water, finely grate hard pecorino or Parmesan onto warm plates. You'll need a small mound on each. Drain the purple sprouting and asparagus, then lay them tenderly on the plates. Remember how fragile those tips are.

      "body": "<p><strong>Mozzarella chicken with pesto</strong></p> <p>I have given two methods for the same dish. The first gives a neater result, while the second, which I think the more interesting, is not for the fainthearted. It includes turning the chicken over in the pan so that the cheese topping melts into the pan juices, resulting in a deeply savoury finish. For 2, as a main dish with salad.</p> <p><strong>2 large boneless chicken breasts </strong><br><strong><br>50g butter</strong><br><strong><br>100g mozzarella cheese, cut into 5mm slices</strong><br><strong><br>2 tbsps groundnut or vegetable oil</strong><br><strong><br>3 tbsps pesto from the jar</strong><br><strong><br>freshly ground black pepper</strong></p> <p>Cut each breast in half lengthways and flatten with a rolling pin between two sheets of clingfilm, until they are 5mm thick. Be gentle, you don't want a pur\u00e9e. Cook the chicken in the melted butter and oil in a shallow pan for 1-2 minutes on each side.</p> <p>Without removing the chicken from the pan, spread each piece with a tablespoon pesto sauce, place a slice of mozzarella on top of the pesto and sprinkle with pepper. Now, EITHER: pick up the chicken with a fish slice and place it in a grill pan. Flash under a preheated hot grill till the mozzarella melts. Add the remaining pesto to the pan with 2 tablespoons water and stir. </p> <p>Remove the chicken from the grill and pour over the pan juices, OR: turn the chicken over with a palette knife so that the cheese is on the bottom. As soon as it starts to melt and sizzle, scoop each piece up with a fish slice, making sure that the melted cheese is not left behind. Turn the chicken over, the cheese and pesto now tantalisingly melted, and place in a warm serving dish, easing the cheese from the slice with a palette knife. Add the remaining pesto and 2 tbsps water to the pan, in which some of the pesto and cheese will be left behind, and stir, scraping up all the crusty bits in the pan. Pour the pesto pan juices over the chicken and eat immediately.</p> <p><strong>Chilli chicken pitta</strong></p> <p>A wonderful snack, spicy and substantial, of chicken pieces with chilli, dribbled with mint-flecked yoghurt, then stuffed into Middle Eastern pitta bread. Don't be put off by the long list of ingredients, you will probably have most of them.<br>For 2 pittas</p> <p><strong>1 small onion or 4 spring onions, chopped</strong><br><strong><br>4 cloves of garlic, crushed</strong><br><strong><br>3 tbsps groundnut oil</strong><br><strong><br>juice of 1 lemon</strong><br><strong><br>1/2 tsp salt</strong><br><strong><br>1 tbsp runny honey</strong><br><strong><br>1 tsp paprika</strong><br><strong><br>? tsp mild chilli powder</strong><br><strong><br>1 small fresh red chilli pepper, seeded and finely chopped</strong><br><strong><br>225g boneless chicken</strong><br><strong><br>For the sauce</strong><br><strong><br>6 tablespoons plain natural yoghurt</strong><br><strong><br>1 tbsp chopped fresh mint</strong><br><strong><br>1 tsp paprika</strong><br><strong><br>2 spring onions, trimmed and chopped</strong><br><strong><br>crisp lettuce and hot pitta bread or baps, to serve</strong></p> <p>Mix together the onion, garlic, oil and lemon juice. Add the salt, honey, paprika and chilli, dried and fresh. Cut the chicken into lumps about 2.5cm square, and stir into the above ingredients. Leave as long as you can, but at least for 20 minutes. Mix the ingredients for the yoghurt sauce.</p> <p>Heat the grill, which should be red hot. Scatter the chicken over the grill pan and cook till the pieces are crisp and shining golden brown on the outside, yet still juicy within - about 8 minutes, turning once. Cram the lumps of chicken into hot pitta bread with the spiced yoghurt and some shredded crisp lettuce.</p> <p><strong>Chicken with spices and cream</strong></p> <p>Nothing raises purist eyebrows quite like the mention of curry powder. I will say in its defence that I have eaten some delicious meals where the main dish was spiced with a commercially-blended powder. I prefer to toast and grind my own spices but when short of time I use a 'proprietary' powder, then add a few spices of my own. For 4</p> <p><strong>4 chicken pieces, breasts or thighs</strong><br><strong><br>salt</strong><br><strong><br>freshly ground black pepper</strong><br><strong><br>25g butter</strong><br><strong><br>1 tbsp groundnut oil</strong><br><strong><br>2 medium onions, roughly chopped</strong><br><strong><br>3 plump cloves of garlic, crushed</strong><br><strong><br>2 tbsps curry powder, from a recently-opened tin</strong><br><strong><br>1/2 tsp ground cinnamon</strong><br><strong><br>4 medium tomatoes, seeded and chopped</strong><br><strong><br>250ml chicken stock </strong><br><strong><br>100ml double cream</strong><br><strong><br>juice of 1/2 lemon</strong></p> <p>Rub salt and pepper into the chicken. Heat the butter and oil in a shallow pan, add the chicken and cook till the skin is golden. Add the onions and garlic and cook over a medium heat until soft, about 7 or 8 minutes.</p> <p>Stir in the curry powder and cinnamon. Cook for 4 minutes until the spices are cooked. Add the tomatoes and the stock, then simmer until the chicken pieces are tender and cooked right through, about 15 minutes.</p> <p>Stir in the cream. Taste the sauce. Add salt and pepper and the lemon juice, a little at a time, tasting as you go. Simmer for 1 minute, then serve hot, with basmati rice.</p> <p><strong>Chicken with orange and black olives</strong></p> <p>This simple supper uses kitchen staples to brighten up a plate of chicken pieces. Use any cut of chicken you like, though I have also tried this recipe with duck breasts and found it even better. Saut\u00e9ing the chicken pieces till golden brown before adding the stock is essential to the flavour and character of the dish. It looks smart served on a plain white plate with a deep rim. For 2</p> <p><strong>2 tbsps olive oil</strong><br><strong><br>50g butter</strong><br><strong><br>2 whole chicken legs</strong><br><strong><br>225ml chicken stock</strong><br><strong><br>1 tsp dried thyme leaves</strong><br><strong><br>12 black olives, stoned</strong><br><strong><br>1 orange, cut in half then into thin slices</strong><br><strong><br>1 tbsp freshly chopped parsley</strong><br><strong><br>salt</strong><br><strong><br>freshly ground black pepper</strong></p> <p>Heat the oil and half the butter in a shallow pan. Brown the chicken pieces on both sides, then add the chicken stock. Stir in the thyme, olives and the orange slices. Cover and simmer gently for 20 minutes.</p> <p>Check that the chicken is cooked - when pierced with the point of a knife the juices should run clear - then remove the pieces to a warm serving plate. Taste the sauce, add the parsley and season it with pepper, and very carefully, if at all, with salt. Turn up the heat, reduce the liquid by bubbling down to 150ml, then whisk in the remaining butter. The sauce will be shiny and slightly thickened when it is ready. Plate the chicken pieces and pour over the sauce. Serve with a starchy accessory, such as wide noodles or steamed potatoes.</p> <p><strong>Chicken with watercress and mushroom sandwich</strong></p> <p>Slice a boneless chicken breast into thin strips about 1cm wide. Season with salt and pepper and saut\u00e9 in butter in a frying pan. Remove the chicken when it starts to brown, after about one minute, and set aside to keep warm. (On a plate with a glass bowl on top will do.) Add a little more butter or a drop more oil to the pan, then cook a handful of sliced mushrooms until softened, about 2 minutes. Lift them out with a draining spoon and add to the chicken. Soften a few shredded lettuce or watercress leaves and stems in the butter left in the pan, lift them out and stir in a couple of tablespoons of mayonnaise. Spread two soft baps or crusty rolls, split and toasted, with the mayonnaise and then pile on the chicken, mushrooms and leaves.</p>",

The second largest teaching union, the National Union of School Masters Union of Women Teachers, heard at its annual conference in Jersey yesterday that the change was \"on the cards\" as a result of a consultation between the office for standards in education and teachers' representatives. Signalling a new era of cooperation with Ofsted - and in particular with the new chief inspector of schools, Mike Tomlinson - the NASUWT's outgoing president, Martin Johnson, told delegates that \"salvation\" was in sight. Speakers had described how teachers' lives had been ruined by the stress and trauma of regular Ofsted inspections. Most schools face inspection every six years, or every four when they cause concern. A motion drawn up nearly a year ago - before the departure of Chris Woodhead, the controversial former inspector, last November - recommended industrial action pending \"fundamental reform\" negotiated with the NASUWT. But yesterday Mr Johnson told delegates any protest must be ruled out because of the changes signalled by Mr Tomlinson, who took over from Mr Woodhead in a one-year appointment. A consultation document is expected to be published after the general election. Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the NASUWT, welcomed the new spirit of cooperation. \"Mike Tomlinson has brought a positive attitude to the job,\" he said. \"Chris Woodhead would have his feet up on the desk and tell you to 'push off'.

I got the war until I was seven, and then came the man: my father, a stranger, the icon in uniform in the nightly kissed photograph. I had grown without him. When he died six years ago, I found myself pulled into a novel that revolved around that absent father, the mother who had changed through enforced independence and the son so painfully supplanted by the daddy for whom he had been educated to pray. The Soldier's Return is fiction fleshed, nerved and dreamt up from a few bones of autobiography. The underpinning is the second world war. It surprises me now that I did not face up to it sooner. </p> <p>I was born in 1939 and have gone back to the few decades before and after that in several books, but it took the death of my father to release or perhaps legitimise an imaginative examination, through fiction, of what the second world war did to lives. Perhaps a certain diffidence had stood in the way. The story of my northern family, like that of millions of others in this country - the majority, I expect - was not on the surface the dramatic and terrible stuff of war. It was not the Holocaust. It was not the atom bomb. These are now seen as the two great markers of world war two; they blot out the rest of it. </p> <p>My father lived, my town was not blitzed, and we were not eliminated. Perhaps unconsciously along the years, I thought that a passing and occasional reference was all that was merited by our average British contribution. I had scarcely more than mentioned it in a previous novel set in the 1940s. </p> <p>It seemed, after all, my father's life, not mine. And the abundance of the telling central images of the first world war, in which my grandfather and several of his brothers had served, seemed to have bled dry our great national pictures of warfare. They were Homeric pictures, clear individual tragedies in trench facing trench. On archive film and in its contemporary poetry, world war one was mythic, the last \"hand to hand\" stand of the European warrior peoples. So what was left for us, for me as a novelist, in the second world war? </p> <p>For me and millions of others in this country and for at least 900 years, the deep ruptures of warring absence, fatherless children and forsaken wives were related in a common net of pain. Following my father's death I understood that the wounds of that war, though in my case in no measure as dramatic or globally significant as the experiences of others, were nevertheless wounds - our wounds. The pain was our pain, fully ready to be fictionalised through the daily conduct of \"ordinary\" lives that were yet, like all ordinary lives, full of cliffs and chasms that can match any of the more flagrant and spectacular events in lives at the extreme. </p> <p>So The Soldier's Return began in that death. The soldier had served in the Burmese campaign, which to the thousands of young men who went there from Cumberland and Westmorland was exotic and exciting but brutal, inhuman and completely off their scale of reference in its barbarity. What he had seen and done over those years had to be locked away when he returned, because there was no way to express it in his nature and in his culture at that time save through a breakdown; and his first job was not to break down. </p> <p>The centre of the novel was not the war, but through my father's return I hoped to bring the second world war into an imaginative work that could encompass it. I would have been too nervous to write a sustained account about war even if I had wanted to. </p> <p>Maybe that nervousness will go, but Tolstoy had been in war, as had Norman Mailer, Evelyn Waugh, Anthony Powell and the first world war poets. Their work is firm, I believe, in the authority of that directly felt experience. My experience was of fallout: of blackouts and rationing, soldiers drilling in the town and aeroplanes hedge-hopping to local airfields to be patched up before returning south; of listening to the nightly news and perhaps fearing an announcement that my father was dead; of the gossip of death and defeat and my mother's resourcefulness tempering her anxiety. The war had to come into the novel in the shape of a small Cumbrian town that was far from the battle lines, though deep in the war through its loss of men and its industrial focus on the war effort. </p> <p>The pain of the soldier was the key. I imagined him straitjacketed in that recent past - unpitying, amoral, yet demanding a response of disciplined rectitude; savage, yet provoking unexpected tender feelings of companionship. I could see how the second world war seized people like us, wrenching us from roots of certainty and place and old narratives of life. The Soldier's Return covers the six months following that return. From the beginning I had intended to take it on, and A Son of War drives the project through the next eight years. One of its purposes is to imagine the effects on family, on society and on the mind, of that mid-century crack-up. </p> <p>At this distance it is possible to begin to see it for what it was. No, we were not Auschwitz, nor were we Hiroshima; and our heads are rightly bowed in their directions. But we were some part of the causes, and certainly included in the consequences of both. Alongside that, though, was a second world war that millions of British families fought through, in which they served and feared, that ripped a hole in the century still not mended and perhaps never to be. It was a war that shook and shaped minds, not only of those involved but also of those in the wings, children most of all. For me that war is being freed up to imagination through time and curiosity, and, perhaps, through need. </p> <p>Melvyn Bragg's novel The Soldier's Return is out in paperback (Hodder, \u00a36.99). His new novel, A Son of War , is published in June (Hodder, \u00a38.99).</p>",

Battles were what history had been about a long time ago, but now the study had moved on to fresher pastures: from past politics to past economics, past sociology, past talking, eating, drinking and loving.

Piles of books about war are massed and serried in the vanguard of any history section.

Lyn Macdonald's many books on the first world war, or Stephen Ambrose or Studs Terkel on the second, provide just a few of the dozens of studies that record the reactions and memories of those who were there. And the controversialists have also moved in, from Niall Ferguson, who argues in The Pity of War that the conventional view of trench warfare is misguided and that the British were just as much to blame for the first world war as anyone else, to those who reconsider our most cherished myths of the second world war (see Angus Calder's The Myth of the Blitz or Richard Overy's recent little book on the Battle of Britain, The Battle ). </p> <p>Even historians of gender have taken up military history. One of the most acclaimed military histories of recent years (though not without its critics) has been Joanna Bourke's An Intimate History of Killing , which argued that \"the characteristic act of men at war is not dying, it is killing\", and discussed masculinity and mayhem in the world wars.

The continuing popularity of fictional and poetic representations naturally feeds popular desire to find out the facts, especially when they are as liberally treated as in the last example.

He is an ex-punk, he frequently and proudly reminds us, with his own substantial history of bohemian activities. Yet here he has written 400 pages about a Victorian military hospital. This passage comes from his depiction of the day in May 1856 when Queen Victoria came to lay the foundation stone: \"These were glorious times, and it seemed the whole country was en f te . Basking in the mid-century glow of empire, England was the cynosure of the civilised world . . .\" </p> <p>Hoare has always been a slightly excitable writer, with a weakness for the grand assertion. And much of what follows is far more critical of Victorian Britain than the above passage suggests - investigations of hospitals rarely show a society in a flattering light. Nevertheless, an intriguing seam of admiration for the sheer scale and confidence of Victorian ambitions runs through this book. It begins with a lovingly extended description of the Royal Victoria Military Hospital as it rose along the estuary shore at Netley, near Southampton. The building was a quarter of a mile long; 1m bricks were used; the facade was hundreds of windows across; it was then the biggest hospital ever constructed. As the slow, guide-bookish sentences tour the hospital and its grounds, you wonder whether size alone will be enough. </p> <p>But more subtle and interesting reasons for devoting a whole thick volume to Netley soon emerge. Hoare makes the compound a microcosm of imperial Britain in all its rationalism and irrationalism. The hospital's south-facing grassy site was chosen in the first place, after much debate, for its healing sea breezes and mild climate. Yet the building's design, after much further debate, stubbornly placed a wide corridor running right along the front of the hospital, between the wards and the sunshine. Convalescing soldiers alternately sweated and froze in this long and draughty glass-fronted space; those confined to bed endured perpetual autumn in the gloomy, north-facing rooms behind. Florence Nightingale called the new building \"a very expensive mistake\". </p> <p>Yet during the later decades of the 19th century, as the global business of defending and expanding the empire sent shiploads of damaged men back to Netley, it quickly became central to the life of the nation. Queen Victoria visited regularly; the hospital's railway station was the third busiest in the country. New medical practices were pioneered, enlightened and otherwise. And the compound as a whole - with its patients from every colony, its imported exotic plants and wicker furniture from the Raj, its armed guards and its pier jutting out into in the grey Solent - grew into a mixture of Victorian seaside resort, military encampment and even a prototype of the multicultural Britain of the distant future. A special funeral pyre was built in the nearby woods for deceased Hindu servicemen. </p> <p>All these teeming details justify Hoare's hyperventilating sen tences. His efforts to prise insights about the past from a headland in Hampshire where only the hospital's chapel and screens of trees now stand achieve a similar suggestiveness - a sense of lost worlds dragged back into view - to that of W G Sebald's spooky criss-crossing of Suffolk in The Rings of Saturn . However, once the story of Netley begins to cool, with the hospital's slow decline beginning from around the end of the first world war, the book starts to try too hard. A page of speculation that experiments may have been conducted on a wounded German prisoner ends like a voice-over from a bad horror film scripted by a passing academic: \"Whatever the truth of Otto Schulz's fate, its mysteries reinforced the hospital's associative power, its impenetrable tree- surrounded site able to contain any number of gothic narratives.\" </p> <p>There is a long digression about nearby Netley Abbey, a medieval ruin long prized by local aesthetes for its dripping atmospheres (you sense the melodramatic Hoare of earlier books reasserting himself). There is also an unconvincing thread of memoir about growing up in a Southampton suburb next door to Netley. Hoare is good on the bomb-flattened blandness of the rest of the city, at least as it appeared to him as a teenager, yet has to admit that he has no clear memory of the hospital itself. It was demolished in 1966, after being damaged in a fire and standing empty for years; virtually all the hospital's records disappeared with the rubble. Hoare hints at conspiracy, but simple neglect of an unused government building seems just as likely. The book peters out in a thicket of personal musings about history and memory. </p> <p>For all the flaws, though, the account of the actual life of the hospital lingers. The rows of temporary huts that shortened and lengthened like a bar graph of each war's progress; the darkened, drugged psychiatric wards where the young R D Laing worked and plotted his famous revolt against such treatments; the almost instant corrosion of the hospital's proud bricks and stone by the damp air of the Solent . . . A restless amateur like Hoare may deal slightly too quickly with such vivid discoveries. But he may also be less likely to take official claims to orderliness at face value than professional military historians; and more likely to make you want to go straight down to Southampton.</p>",

      "byline": "D J Taylor",

      "body": "<p>What is a war novel? Well, to start with the obvious ones, War and Peace is a war novel, and so is Stephen Crane's The Red Badge of Courage (American civil war) and Norman Mailer's The Naked and the Dead (second world war). But so, too, is Vanity Fair , a survey of early-19th century English society that has Waterloo as its pivot; and so, curiously enough, is Alec Waugh's The Loom of Youth , published in 1917 when the first world war was at its height, but set in the unmartial domain of an English public school. </p> <p>Outwardly, the connection between Mailer's dispatches from the US-Japanese conflict and Waugh's schoolboy rugby players is not very great, but it is there. Mailer's novel is, among other things, an eyewitness account of battle. The Loom of Youth , with its rebel hero itching to defy reactionary officialdom, reflects a deep frustration with the forces administering national life. Appearing at a time when the Flanders campaign was drifting into calamitous stalemate, its attack on the institution that had produced the British officer class saw its author denounced in print and from the pulpit. </p> <p>Whether set in a Somme trench or at a removed historical vantage point - Vanity Fair was published more than 30 years after the military events it purports to describe - the war novel is one of the most pervasive modern literary genres, all the more so when it deals with conflict obliquely. Certainly, most of the significant English fiction of the immediate post-war era falls into this category. Nineteen Eighty Four (1949), for example, takes place in a dingy environment of ration cards, falling bombs and the awful feeling of there never being enough to eat - essentially the London Blitz atmosphere of 1940-41. Even Lucky Jim (1954) languishes in the war's long shadow, with Jim Dixon, Kingsley Amis's harassed academic, keeping his lecture notes in an old RAF file and feeling class unease in the presence of an ex-officer student who fought at Anzio. Running through Amis's novel, too, is a tremendous feeling of there being good times ahead - a kind of vista of girls' faces, beer, books and jazz - a metaphorical shutter slammed down over the emotional upsets of 1939-45. </p> <p>But as Amis and his contemporaries soon discovered, the shutter was not so easily closed. The post-war romans-fleuves - Anthony Powell's A Dance to the Music of Time , say, or Simon Raven's Alms for Oblivion sequence - were consistently absorbed by the idea of personal and social change brought about by conflict. The first two novels in A S Byatt's post-war series, The Virgin in the Garden (1978) and Still Life (1985), are studies of 1950s adolescents who are keenly aware of the privations of a wartime childhood. Even today, over half a century since the end of the second world war, the old imperatives endure: a great deal that happens in modern British fiction takes place in that ever more expansive hinterland, After the War (itself the title of a panoramic novel by Frederic Raphael). </p> <p>This spring's publishing catalogues contain an even larger number of war novels than usual, notably John Lawton's Riptide ; Rodney Hall's The Day We Had Hitler Home ; Francis Cottam's The Fire Fighter ; Stevie Davies's The Element of Water and A Son of War , Melvyn Bragg's forthcoming sequel to his award-winning The Soldier's Return . With the exception of Bragg, born in 1939, none of these writers possesses even childhood memories of war, yet the imaginative lure remains. </p> <p>Questioned over their motivation, fortysomething novelists who write about war usually murmur something about a mixture of guilt and relief at not having had to fight themselves. This was Sebastian Faulks's line on the origins of Birdsong (first world war) and Charlotte Gray (second world war). George Orwell said something similar about his guilt as a teenage schoolboy, hearing of the deaths of boys only a few years senior to him. Rising above it, though, is the awareness not only of war's profound importance for the society we now inhabit - a world that was formed in the crucible of 1939-45 - but of the aesthetic scope this offers to the novelist. </p> <p>Like a Gladstone bag, which always has the capacity to yield up an extra compartment, the British war novel is no longer a single genre but a series of genres, many of them interconnecting. Most obviously there is the physical description of warfare, whether played out in military engagements or witnessed by civilians (for example, Henry Green's accounts of the London Auxiliary Fire Service). Then there are the books about life on the home front - Monica Dickens's The Fancy (1942), which surveys a group of operatives in an aircraft factory, or Patrick Hamilton's The Slaves of Solitude (1947), a fabulously gloomy portrait of the denizens of a wartime Thames Valley boarding house. The \"spoof\" war novel goes back as far as Peter Fleming's The Flying Visit (1940), which gets a mention in Riptide . In this book Hitler, wishing to gloat over the Luftwaffe attacks, has himself flown over England, survives a plane crash and wanders around the countryside for a while before turning up at a village fancy-dress competition where he is awarded first prize. Equally enduring is the tale of the warrior's return to unpromising postwar reality; The Soldier's Return can be interestingly compared to Warwick Deeping's 1920s bestseller Sorrell and Son . Finally there is that huge corpus of books dealing with war's aftermath, often surreptitiously and by means of doctored representations of the war itself. </p> <p> This last category - representative examples might be Anthony Powell's three war novels and Evelyn Waugh's Sword of Honour trilogy - offers a reminder of the great shift in perspective that has taken place in the past 30 years. The novels of the immediate postwar era, many of them written by former serving soldiers whose political views inclined to the right, were often exercises in retrospective fixing. In the 1950s Evelyn Waugh genuinely believed that he inhabited a kind of socialist holiday camp. His response was to project his dissatisfactions back onto the conduct of the war, mocking the idea of a \"people's war\" and detecting in it the seeds of the phantom socialism that he imagined was ruining contemporary Britain. Powell's angle is more subtle, but a novel such as The Military Philosophers , set amid the Whitehall intelligence units, is full of loaded prefigurative remarks about a series of post-war social arrangements that, one gathers, were not much to Powell's taste. </p> <p>Three decades and more on, this kind of ideology has all but disappeared. Detached from the immediate politics of the war and its aftermath, a modern novelist is likely to be interested in more elemental themes of loss, betrayal and divided loyalty or questions of national identity - as in Captain Corelli's Mandolin . Stevie Davies's The Element of Water (Women's Press, \u00a39.99) features a Welsh-reared refugee who, returning to her native Germany in the late 1950s, comes across the son of her Nazi father's greatest friend. The hero of Francis Cottam's excellent debut The Fire Fighter (Chatto &amp; Windus, \u00a315.99), commissioned to preserve key buildings in the City of London, gets entangled with a doubtfully loyal love interest. John Lawton's Riptide (Weidenfield &amp; Nicolson, \u00a316.99) takes in the search for a highly placed Nazi double agent who has supposedly fled to England. The \"spoof\", it turns out, is still going strong. With its cameo appearances by famous names, Riptide falls into this category, while Rodney Hall's The Day We Had Hitler Home (Granta, \u00a315.99) fills in Hitler's \"lost\" year of 1919 with an account of him turning up in New South Wales, mistakenly included in a batch of returning Australian soldiers. Hall shows that ideological purpose is alive and well, pointing out that the first national act of fledgling Australia was to sign the Treaty of Versailles, thereby creating the conditions in which nazism grew and prospered. </p> <p>Each of these novels raises a fundamental procedural question: how does a writer convey, realistically, the second world war, a six-year period of carnage regularly pronounced to be \"beyond words\"? How do you describe an air raid, a tank battle or an explosion on a submarine? This problem exercised creative writers who wanted to record their own experiences of world war two almost from the start. Henry Green's fire-service pieces are done in sharp, impressionist fragments. The opening scene of Waugh's Officers and Gentlemen - an air raid on the West End of London viewed from the steps of a gentleman's club - looks to art (\"'Pure Turner,' said Guy Crouchback enthusiastically\"). Almost as compelling is the problem of idiom - reproducing or approximating speech without descending into stereotype. The solutions on display here are varied: in Francis Cottam's novel, some punctilious descriptions of scene and incident; in John Lawton's, a knowingness that an American general blazing away at a German bomber with a sporting rifle from the roof of Claridges comes very close to burlesque. </p> <p>Inevitably, throughout these varied takes on warfare and our responses to it, symbolism lurks. Practically the only false note in Stevie Davies's absorbing account of cross-generational conflict comes when a war veteran talks to his son aboutthe SS and then carries on cooking supper. \"He put in the steak, turning up the flame. Blood spat in the hot butter and filled the kitchen with the smell of charring meat.\" There are other kinds of charring meat not too far away, and it would be a very placid reader who wasn't reminded of human corpses sizzling in the Buchenwald ovens. The modern war novel, in all its myriad variants, is full of these kind of echoes - resonant voices shouting back across time, made more, not less, compelling by distance. </p> <p>DJ Taylor's most recent novel is The Comedy Man (Duck Editions, \u00a39.99).</p>",

      "bodyText": "What is a war novel? Well, to start with the obvious ones, War and Peace is a war novel, and so is Stephen Crane's The Red Badge of Courage (American civil war) and Norman Mailer's The Naked and the Dead (second world war). But so, too, is Vanity Fair , a survey of early-19th century English society that has Waterloo as its pivot; and so, curiously enough, is Alec Waugh's The Loom of Youth , published in 1917 when the first world war was at its height, but set in the unmartial domain of an English public school. Outwardly, the connection between Mailer's dispatches from the US-Japanese conflict and Waugh's schoolboy rugby players is not very great, but it is there. Mailer's novel is, among other things, an eyewitness account of battle. The Loom of Youth , with its rebel hero itching to defy reactionary officialdom, reflects a deep frustration with the forces administering national life. Appearing at a time when the Flanders campaign was drifting into calamitous stalemate, its attack on the institution that had produced the British officer class saw its author denounced in print and from the pulpit. Whether set in a Somme trench or at a removed historical vantage point - Vanity Fair was published more than 30 years after the military events it purports to describe - the war novel is one of the most pervasive modern literary genres, all the more so when it deals with conflict obliquely. Certainly, most of the significant English fiction of the immediate post-war era falls into this category. Nineteen Eighty Four (1949), for example, takes place in a dingy environment of ration cards, falling bombs and the awful feeling of there never being enough to eat - essentially the London Blitz atmosphere of 1940-41. Even Lucky Jim (1954) languishes in the war's long shadow, with Jim Dixon, Kingsley Amis's harassed academic, keeping his lecture notes in an old RAF file and feeling class unease in the presence of an ex-officer student who fought at Anzio. Running through Amis's novel, too, is a tremendous feeling of there being good times ahead - a kind of vista of girls' faces, beer, books and jazz - a metaphorical shutter slammed down over the emotional upsets of 1939-45. But as Amis and his contemporaries soon discovered, the shutter was not so easily closed. The post-war romans-fleuves - Anthony Powell's A Dance to the Music of Time , say, or Simon Raven's Alms for Oblivion sequence - were consistently absorbed by the idea of personal and social change brought about by conflict. The first two novels in A S Byatt's post-war series, The Virgin in the Garden (1978) and Still Life (1985), are studies of 1950s adolescents who are keenly aware of the privations of a wartime childhood. Even today, over half a century since the end of the second world war, the old imperatives endure: a great deal that happens in modern British fiction takes place in that ever more expansive hinterland, After the War (itself the title of a panoramic novel by Frederic Raphael). This spring's publishing catalogues contain an even larger number of war novels than usual, notably John Lawton's Riptide ; Rodney Hall's The Day We Had Hitler Home ; Francis Cottam's The Fire Fighter ; Stevie Davies's The Element of Water and A Son of War , Melvyn Bragg's forthcoming sequel to his award-winning The Soldier's Return . With the exception of Bragg, born in 1939, none of these writers possesses even childhood memories of war, yet the imaginative lure remains. Questioned over their motivation, fortysomething novelists who write about war usually murmur something about a mixture of guilt and relief at not having had to fight themselves. This was Sebastian Faulks's line on the origins of Birdsong (first world war) and Charlotte Gray (second world war). George Orwell said something similar about his guilt as a teenage schoolboy, hearing of the deaths of boys only a few years senior to him. Rising above it, though, is the awareness not only of war's profound importance for the society we now inhabit - a world that was formed in the crucible of 1939-45 - but of the aesthetic scope this offers to the novelist. Like a Gladstone bag, which always has the capacity to yield up an extra compartment, the British war novel is no longer a single genre but a series of genres, many of them interconnecting. Most obviously there is the physical description of warfare, whether played out in military engagements or witnessed by civilians (for example, Henry Green's accounts of the London Auxiliary Fire Service). Then there are the books about life on the home front - Monica Dickens's The Fancy (1942), which surveys a group of operatives in an aircraft factory, or Patrick Hamilton's The Slaves of Solitude (1947), a fabulously gloomy portrait of the denizens of a wartime Thames Valley boarding house. The \"spoof\" war novel goes back as far as Peter Fleming's The Flying Visit (1940), which gets a mention in Riptide .

She then shows how during the Restoration curious people, and scientists in particular, began to be regarded as objects of curiosity, and traces curiosity as a phenomenon through certain 18th-century cultural practices: collecting and connoisseurship, scientific research, philosophy, consumption, spectatorship and gossip. </p> <p>What motivates all of these activities, according to Benedict, is the spirit of inquiry. And what drives inquiry, she argues, is ambition. The thesis seems correct, and is certainly compelling. If one considers only one's own family and friends, it is clear that humility breeds contentment, while curiosity gives you itchy feet, bad breath and a big head. The incurious prefer to stay at home; the curious go abroad, keep journals and cause trouble. The boast of the curious is the same as that of Inigo Jones, scribbling after Petrarch in Rome in 1614: Altro diletto che imparar non provo . (The more curious may wish to consult a dictionary for a translation. Oh, all right then: \"There is no greater pleasure for me than in learning.\") </p> <p>The object of our inquiries is irrelevant: wall coverings, curries, the sex life of the rhinoceros, the insides of dogs. Everyone is curious about something, and everyone collects: things, ideas, people. When Albrecht D\u00fcrer visited the Netherlands, he bought a tortoiseshell shield, an elk's foot and an ox horn. Which of us does not have our own little hoard tucked away somewhere, in attic, loft or box under the bed: old jigsaws, biros, snowstorms, cigarette cards, the titbits that make life worth living? One is reminded of Samuel Johnson - \"it is by studying little things that we attain the great art of having as little misery and as much happiness as possible\" - or perhaps Julie Andrews (\"When the dog bites / When the bee stings / When I'm feeling sad / I simply remember my favourite things / And then I don't feel so bad\"). </p> <p>All of us are bores, then, all of us pompous and embarrassing, inclined to give forth on some curi ous subject. George I liked cutting out paper figures, Nabokov had his butterflies and David Beckham is clearly very interested in fashion, popular music and interior design.

This may explain why it is not usually found these days within universities, and certainly not within humanities faculties, where appointment depends upon specialisation and the production of pale, complacent articles. Professionalism, one might argue, is the enemy of ruddy curiosity. The curious mind strives after freedom, the academic strives after a professorship.

The strange history of exhibition animals, for example, or of micrographia, museum guidebooks, gossip or the story of The Universal Magazine are all far more interesting than anything Benedict has to say about them. The facts are Technicolor, while the theory is grey. Benedict is quick to distinguish between curiosity and wonder - wonder \"reverses the novelty it encounters\", while curiosity seeks to explain it - but it is difficult to see how one can exist without the other. The book's unstated purpose, and its paradox, is to turn curiosities into applied knowledge. </p> <p>Benedict clicks her cabinet shut with a few remarks on the 20th century.

      "body": "<p>William Hazlitt is one of the greatest writers of prose in the English language, and the greatest exponent of the essay - that personal, miscellaneous, free-flowing prose composition that constitutes an art form celebrated for its riches of content and style. He is also arguably the best and most important critic of the early 19th century's Romantic epoch, making original contributions to appreciation of art, theatre, literature and philosophy. </p> <p>His remarkable essays fill 20 volumes, making him one of the English language's most outstanding and prolific authors. And as if that were not enough, Hazlitt was also a hard-hitting political polemicist and journalist who, at the expense of his own chances for advancement, defended a radical stance that was actively persecuted in his day. He attacked privilege and monarchy, was a lifelong partisan of the founding principles of the French Revolution, which were democratic, socialist, and based on a new conception of human rights and secular freedoms. For this reason he opposed the unjust and unnecessary war waged by the crowns of Europe against France's republican revolution, and was devastated when the Bourbon regime was restored in Paris in 1815, because it meant that absolutist monarchies had conquered the efforts of a people to cast off feudalism and to try to construct a new society based on liberty, equality and fraternity. </p> <p>Given Hazlitt's resolutely independent radicalism, it is unsurprising that his many admirers include leading politicians of the left. Michael Foot is chief among them, and has often written about Hazlitt's political commitment and consistency, and the way in which Hazlitt suffered as a result of adhering to principle - for, unlike his early friends Coleridge and Wordsworth, he never traded his principles for establishment honours or government pensions. </p> <p>But it is Hazlitt's power as a critic that Foot reserves for greatest praise, quoting Keats's description of him as \"the Shakespeare prose writer of our glorious century\". Hazlitt had, Foot says, \"a poet's insight into the world and a poet's imagination, with not a trace of egotism, sublime or otherwise\". </p> <p>The beauty and power of Hazlitt's prose is credited with gifts more usually associated with poetry. The poet and critic Tom Paulin recognises it, too, saying that he was prompted to write his study of Hazlitt's genius by a \"wish for some glimpse of the driven, fallible human being who created such ecstatically definite prose\", aiming especially to understand the \"poetics\" of Hazlitt's style. In his book The Day-Star of Liberty, Paulin traces the evolution of the intellectual and reformist ethos of dissent, which Hazlitt, although not a religious man, inherited from his father, and which formed his outlook. </p> <p>Dissent was not just a religious tradition, it was an ideological one. In 18th-century England the besteducated, most thoughtful and independent-minded people were to be found among the Dissenters, so called because they refused to subscribe to the established church - the Church of England, headed by the reigning monarch - on the grounds that no secular authority is entitled to place itself higher than scripture, and that no test of faith and truth can be higher than an individual's own conscience. Dissenters were therefore disqualified from full participation in public life and the privileges of citizenship. In particular, they were barred from standing for parliament or attending either of the ancient universities. </p> <p>Their response was to campaign with intelligence and persuasiveness for reform, and to found their own academies. These academies were the cutting edge of education in their day. While the old universities dozed on their rich endowments, requiring no more from their undergraduates than knowledge of a few classical texts, the new, independent, dissenting academies taught science and mathematics, history and geography, philosophy, political economy and modern languages. </p> <p>It was not the religious beliefs so much as the fiercely autonomous and questioning character of dissent that influenced Hazlitt. He attended the academy at Hackney in London, where he had a first-class education in the best dissenting manner. But it was so effective that he and all his fellow students became agnostics, so its dismayed financial backers withdrew their support and the academy closed down. It explains his independence of mind and adherence to principle, traits that he shared with his father - and which, in the usual way of the world, did no good to either of them in practical terms. Hazlitt's father, a Unitarian minister who was a kindly man but an uncompromising and utterly independent cleric, was regarded by his colleagues as a loose cannon, and therefore spent most of his life preaching in the rural backwater of Wem in Shropshire, shut out from the political and doctrinal controversies he longed to engage in. </p> <p>Hazlitt suffered the same fate in the secular sphere, making his living as a writer and critic and never (unlike Coleridge and Wordsworth) getting help from the public purse in the form of rewards or pensions, because he was always too critical of the establishment. As a result, Hazlitt had a life of struggle and disappointment. His private life brought him much unhappiness too, not least occasioned by his famous passion for a young woman called Sarah Walker, about which he wrote a strange and extraordinary book, the Liber Amoris. This book destroyed his reputation and remains a focus of hostility for present-day feminist critics. He was a married man, yet publicly admitted to a passion for a woman half his age, who - as he carefully put it - for hours every day, for months on end, \"sat in my lap, her arms around my neck, and mine twined round her in the fondest manner\". He asked, \"Is it not enough to make anyone frantic to have been admitted to such intimacy with so sweet a creature?\" </p> <p>He had divorced his first wife, Sarah Stoddart, in the hope of marrying Walker, but in the end Walker refused him, thereby breaking his heart and his health. He lived only seven years longer, under a cloud of grief and infamy. When he died he was past the greatest period of his contemporary fame, but he was still a controversial figure, feared and disliked by the establishment yet admired by younger writers and radicals. </p> <p>Hazlitt died in the hot summer of 1830. The illness that killed him, either stomach cancer or ulcers, had been creeping up on him for a long time, but only began to overwhelm him in his last months. He was still writing journalism, which had always been his principal source of income; at that point he was writing for a magazine called the New Monthly. His essay The Free Admission appeared in its July issue, celebrating the years of delight he had experienced as a theatre critic. For him the theatre was \"a relief, a craving, a necessity\". </p> <p>But by August, Hazlitt was too ill even to totter to his free seat in the gallery. He was 52, gaunt and grey, and scarcely able to eat. Even the joy of the Revolution of the Three Days in Paris, which finally drove the Bourbons from France, could only cheer him briefly. From his bed he wrote that the revolution \"was like a resurrection from the dead, and showed plainly that liberty too has a spirit of life in it; and the hatred of oppression is 'the unquenchable flame, the worm that dies not' \". But privately he said to a friend: \"Ah, I am afraid things will go back again.\" </p> <p>His August contribution to the New Monthly was an essay very different from The Free Admission. Called The Sick Chamber, it began: \"What a difference between this subject and my last . . . Yet from the crowded theatre to the sick chamber, from the noise, the glare, the keen delight, to the loneliness, the darkness, the dullness, and the pain, there is but one step.\" </p> <p>For a while he kept on writing, sitting up in bed, but increasingly fitfully. As August passed into September it was evident to everyone, and to himself, that he was fading. As he grew weaker, his voice disappeared into a whisper and he could scarcely cope with visitors. He became anxious about money, one reason being that, trapped in his bed, he could not provide for the woman he was then in love with, a \"girl of the theatre\" (a prostitute) whose name has been lost to the record. His son said that his anxiety over her was worse than his illness. Hazlitt forgot that Francis Jeffrey was no longer editor of the great Edinburgh Review to which he had so long been a contributor, and with a quivering hand he wrote to him: \"Dear Sir, I am dying. Can you send me \u00a310, and so consummate your many kindnesses to me?\" Jeffrey sent \u00a350. </p> <p>A friend described Hazlitt at the last: \"He lay ghastly, shrunk, and helpless, on the bed from which he never afterwards rose. His mind seemed to have weathered all the dangers of extreme sickness, and to be safe and strong as ever. He could not lift his hand from the coverlet; and his voice was changed and diminished to a hoarse whisper, resembling the faint scream that I have heard from birds. I never was so sensible of the power of death before.\" </p> <p>On Wednesday September 15 Hazlitt's old friend and publisher James Hessey wrote to the poet John Clare, \"Poor Hazlitt is very ill indeed - I fear on his death bed.\" On Friday he seemed a little better; but by Saturday it was clear that he was dying. His son, also called William, Charles Lamb, and two other friends were with him. He could talk very little, but what he said with his shrill dying breath was remem bered by them all: that he wished to see his mother, and that he was pleased his son was soon to marry. And then, to their astonishment and that of posterity, he whispered, \"Well, I've had a happy life.\" </p> <p>Death came soon afterwards, so imperceptibly and subtly that for several moments no one was aware that his breathing had ceased, and that he was at last, and finally, beyond all passion and pain. </p> <p>Hazlitt's funeral was arranged by Lamb, his best and oldest friend. It took place five days later and was sparsely attended - Lamb, Hazlitt's son, and a few others gathered to lower his coffin into the damp clay. The press was warm in its obituaries, the warmest coming from Leigh Hunt: \"Mr Hazlitt was one of the profoundest writers of the day, an admirable reasoner (no one got better or sooner at the heart of a question than he did), the best general critic, the greatest critic on art that ever appeared (his writings on the subject cast a light like a painted window), exquisite in his relish of poetry, an untameable lover of liberty, and with all his humour and irritability (of which no man had more), a sincere friend and a generous enemy.\" </p> <p>Hazlitt was buried in the churchyard of St Anne in Soho, where his grave is the only one still visible. A mystery admirer arranged for a tombstone with an elaborate inscription to be raised above his grave (see above). The author of this encomium - much of it true and just - is unknown. </p> <p>Various candidates have been suggested, but the warmth and grief of the closing words hints that it might have been none other than Sarah Stoddart, the remarkable woman he had divorced 10 years earlier because of his love affair. Despite the divorce, she remained his friend and most loyal reader, keeping cuttings of his essays, and often visiting him - even helping to nurse him in his final weeks. And it was she who wrote his death notice in the Times. If it was indeed Sarah Stoddart who raised the memorial stone to Hazlitt, it is a touching fact, and does both her and him great credit. </p> <p>The handsome memorial vanished long ago, and now there is only a flat gravestone marking the spot where Hazlitt lies in St Anne's churchyard. It gives the bare details of his dates of birth and death, and the literary pilgrim might not even notice it, because it lies obscured in the grass in the shade of bushes. The churchyard is now a little park, marked by the dome-topped tower which is all that remains of the original church of St Anne, destroyed in the blitz. Hazlitt would not in the least mind the company of Soho's homeless and addicts, who are chief among those who make use of the churchyard as a quiet retreat; for he sympathised with the plight of such, whom he saw as victims of a harsh and selfish world. </p> <p>It is not altogether odd that a man who had such emotional and intellectual struggles with himself and his world should nevertheless say, as he died, \"I have had a happy life.\" After all, Hazlitt spent his days as he chose: \"I loitered my life away, reading books, looking at pictures, going to plays, hearing, thinking, writing on what pleased me best,\" he wrote. But it was not an idyll. He never found the love he longed for, and which - a fact that makes things worse, not better - for a time of madness he thought he had found, or rather, narrowly missed. \"I have wanted only one thing to make me happy; but wanting that, have wanted everything!\" </p> <p>One might almost say that after the Sarah Walker debacle something in Hazlitt - some silent spiritual part of himself, broken and scattered by the emotional disaster - in effect turned its back on England, and on life. This did not, however, prevent him from adding to the corpus of his writings two great works: The Spirit of the Age and The Plain Speaker. </p> <p>In his very last essay, a nostalgic valediction called The Letter-Bell, written just weeks before his death, Hazlitt recalled how his devotion to the principles of human rights had been born with the French Revolution, and how the apostasy of his early friends - Coleridge, Wordsworth and Southey - had disappointed him terribly. </p> <p> Unlike them he had kept the faith; in his youth, he wrote, the light of the French Revolution had guided his steps, and he had never wavered from his belief in its principles. \"I have never given the lie to my own soul. If I have felt the impression once, I feel it more strongly a second time; and I have no wish to revile or discard my best thoughts. There is a thorough keeping in what I write - not a line that betrays a principle or disguises a feeling. If my wealth is small, it all goes to enrich the same heap; and trifles in this way accumulate to a tolerable sum.\" </p> <p>This is true; Hazlitt was steadfast to his principles, which were altruistic and humane; and his steadfastness cost him dear, for it meant being always excluded from the comfortable inner circles of patronage. The depth of Hazlitt's feelings explains his anger at the apostates. </p> <p>As a youth he had heard Coleridge's revolutionary eloquence; it appalled him to find that such beautiful and rousing sentiments were so shallowly worn and so easily betrayed. Southey and Wordsworth had likewise been eloquent in their championing of the Revolution but became bitter opponents of it later, and had likewise become placemen, pensioners of a reactionary government, which had wasted the country's resources in a laborious and bloody effort to extirpate those principles, in order to preserve the privileges that the fortunate classes in England felt were threatened by them. Hazlitt was shocked as much by what his former friends had done as by the failure of mankind's hopes, and his only way of appeasing the agony was to castigate the apostates endlessly, neither letting them forget their betrayal, nor allowing the memory of the \"blissful dawn\" of human rights to fade and die. </p> <p>\u0095 A committee for the restoration of Hazlitt's monument in St Anne's churchyard has been set up in conjunction with the Guardian. Members include Michael Foot, AC Grayling, Tom Paulin, Duncan Wu, Tim Miller of St Anne's, Ian Mayes, the readers' editor of the Guardian, and Annalena McAfee, the editor of Saturday Review. The committee has commissioned letter carver Lida Kindersley, of Cardozo Kindersley Workshop, to design the gravestone.

      "bodyText": "William Hazlitt is one of the greatest writers of prose in the English language, and the greatest exponent of the essay - that personal, miscellaneous, free-flowing prose composition that constitutes an art form celebrated for its riches of content and style. He is also arguably the best and most important critic of the early 19th century's Romantic epoch, making original contributions to appreciation of art, theatre, literature and philosophy. His remarkable essays fill 20 volumes, making him one of the English language's most outstanding and prolific authors. And as if that were not enough, Hazlitt was also a hard-hitting political polemicist and journalist who, at the expense of his own chances for advancement, defended a radical stance that was actively persecuted in his day. He attacked privilege and monarchy, was a lifelong partisan of the founding principles of the French Revolution, which were democratic, socialist, and based on a new conception of human rights and secular freedoms. For this reason he opposed the unjust and unnecessary war waged by the crowns of Europe against France's republican revolution, and was devastated when the Bourbon regime was restored in Paris in 1815, because it meant that absolutist monarchies had conquered the efforts of a people to cast off feudalism and to try to construct a new society based on liberty, equality and fraternity. Given Hazlitt's resolutely independent radicalism, it is unsurprising that his many admirers include leading politicians of the left. Michael Foot is chief among them, and has often written about Hazlitt's political commitment and consistency, and the way in which Hazlitt suffered as a result of adhering to principle - for, unlike his early friends Coleridge and Wordsworth, he never traded his principles for establishment honours or government pensions. But it is Hazlitt's power as a critic that Foot reserves for greatest praise, quoting Keats's description of him as \"the Shakespeare prose writer of our glorious century\". Hazlitt had, Foot says, \"a poet's insight into the world and a poet's imagination, with not a trace of egotism, sublime or otherwise\". The beauty and power of Hazlitt's prose is credited with gifts more usually associated with poetry. The poet and critic Tom Paulin recognises it, too, saying that he was prompted to write his study of Hazlitt's genius by a \"wish for some glimpse of the driven, fallible human being who created such ecstatically definite prose\", aiming especially to understand the \"poetics\" of Hazlitt's style. In his book The Day-Star of Liberty, Paulin traces the evolution of the intellectual and reformist ethos of dissent, which Hazlitt, although not a religious man, inherited from his father, and which formed his outlook. Dissent was not just a religious tradition, it was an ideological one. In 18th-century England the besteducated, most thoughtful and independent-minded people were to be found among the Dissenters, so called because they refused to subscribe to the established church - the Church of England, headed by the reigning monarch - on the grounds that no secular authority is entitled to place itself higher than scripture, and that no test of faith and truth can be higher than an individual's own conscience. Dissenters were therefore disqualified from full participation in public life and the privileges of citizenship. In particular, they were barred from standing for parliament or attending either of the ancient universities. Their response was to campaign with intelligence and persuasiveness for reform, and to found their own academies. These academies were the cutting edge of education in their day. While the old universities dozed on their rich endowments, requiring no more from their undergraduates than knowledge of a few classical texts, the new, independent, dissenting academies taught science and mathematics, history and geography, philosophy, political economy and modern languages. It was not the religious beliefs so much as the fiercely autonomous and questioning character of dissent that influenced Hazlitt.

      "body": "<p>The manifesto that the Italian futurists published in 1909 was nothing if not spirited. \"We want to demolish the museums, the libraries,\" they announced, \"fight against moralism, feminism and all the opportunistic and utilitarian cowardices.\" Those strong espressos really heighten the rhetoric, don't you find? </p> <p>How sad for the futurists, then, that the museums weren't destroyed. Instead, galleries show the very art that was supposed to be their death knell. Libraries still thrive, some of them housing art books that devote short chapters to that historical curio known as futurism. As for moralism and feminism, they aren't quite dead either. At least, let's hope not. </p> <p>The futurists would have hated the fact that a railway station - that home of power, steam, energy and all the modern virtues they championed so naively - has been converted into the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay. Worse still, this former temple to speed is celebrating the very art against which they affected to rebel. Until July the museum will house an exhibition of Italian art from 1880 to the launch of the futurist manifesto, as well as two nice little allied shows devoted to the poet Gabriele d'Annunzio and the designer Carlo Bugatti. </p> <p>Futurism was purportedly a modernist revolt against worthy Victorian artistic movements. For artists such as Umberto Boccioni and Giacomo Balla, these movements were enemies of any kind of progress, and especially aesthetic development. The futurists championed \"speed, war, the suppression of the subject\". In the last room of the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay's exhibition, we can only look on the works that grew out of this philosophy, and despair. We know how the futurists' own future turned out - thatspeed and war filled Flanders fields with dead and reduced Hiroshima to toxic ruins. </p> <p>Typical of such art is Boccioni's 1910 painting A Fight in the Arcade, in which a mob of Lowry-esque stick figures lose their identities and form a rush of energy in a proto-vorticist force field. It's perhaps facile to see fascism rearing its ugly head in this kind of work, not least because if we do so, we fail to understand futurism as an artistic movement. But this formalist celebration of fist-fighting still seems jejune . </p> <p>The Challenge of Modernity to Italian Art is hardly the summer blockbuster one might expect from the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay. As soon as you step through the doors, the English-speaking hordes looking for \"Van Go\" disappear to be replaced by pockets of Italian intellectuals reflecting on a little-known chapter in their artistic history. </p> <p>The exhibition starts with a bombastic flourish of outsized paintings. It was the 1880s, and canvas must have been cheap and paint free. Never, outside the rooms at the Louvre that house David's paintings of Napoleon crowning himself and The Tennis Court Oath, have I seen such big pictures so shriekingly displayed. Giulio Aristide Sartorio's Diane of Ephesus and the Slaves measures more than 13ft by 9ft. He was influenced by the British pre-Raphaelites, but his subjects' inviting buttocks are from a sexual world unimagined by the likes of Edward Burne-Jones - that chaste Brummie visionary.

      "bodyText": "The manifesto that the Italian futurists published in 1909 was nothing if not spirited. \"We want to demolish the museums, the libraries,\" they announced, \"fight against moralism, feminism and all the opportunistic and utilitarian cowardices.\" Those strong espressos really heighten the rhetoric, don't you find? How sad for the futurists, then, that the museums weren't destroyed. Instead, galleries show the very art that was supposed to be their death knell. Libraries still thrive, some of them housing art books that devote short chapters to that historical curio known as futurism. As for moralism and feminism, they aren't quite dead either. At least, let's hope not. The futurists would have hated the fact that a railway station - that home of power, steam, energy and all the modern virtues they championed so naively - has been converted into the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay. Worse still, this former temple to speed is celebrating the very art against which they affected to rebel. Until July the museum will house an exhibition of Italian art from 1880 to the launch of the futurist manifesto, as well as two nice little allied shows devoted to the poet Gabriele d'Annunzio and the designer Carlo Bugatti. Futurism was purportedly a modernist revolt against worthy Victorian artistic movements. For artists such as Umberto Boccioni and Giacomo Balla, these movements were enemies of any kind of progress, and especially aesthetic development. The futurists championed \"speed, war, the suppression of the subject\". In the last room of the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay's exhibition, we can only look on the works that grew out of this philosophy, and despair. We know how the futurists' own future turned out - thatspeed and war filled Flanders fields with dead and reduced Hiroshima to toxic ruins. Typical of such art is Boccioni's 1910 painting A Fight in the Arcade, in which a mob of Lowry-esque stick figures lose their identities and form a rush of energy in a proto-vorticist force field. It's perhaps facile to see fascism rearing its ugly head in this kind of work, not least because if we do so, we fail to understand futurism as an artistic movement. But this formalist celebration of fist-fighting still seems jejune . The Challenge of Modernity to Italian Art is hardly the summer blockbuster one might expect from the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay. As soon as you step through the doors, the English-speaking hordes looking for \"Van Go\" disappear to be replaced by pockets of Italian intellectuals reflecting on a little-known chapter in their artistic history. The exhibition starts with a bombastic flourish of outsized paintings. It was the 1880s, and canvas must have been cheap and paint free. Never, outside the rooms at the Louvre that house David's paintings of Napoleon crowning himself and The Tennis Court Oath, have I seen such big pictures so shriekingly displayed. Giulio Aristide Sartorio's Diane of Ephesus and the Slaves measures more than 13ft by 9ft. He was influenced by the British pre-Raphaelites, but his subjects' inviting buttocks are from a sexual world unimagined by the likes of Edward Burne-Jones - that chaste Brummie visionary. Some trans-species orgy, it would not be ludicrous to suppose, has just taken place. All the slaves look shagged, as do the horses, tigers and lions. Only Diana and a stuck-up eagle remain aloof. In Sartorio's equally big Gorgon and the Heroes, the wing-footed heroine walks across the vanquished bodies of her muscle-bound foes, brushing the luxuriant red locks that fall below her waist, the minx. She has an ivory body and the implausibly hairless genitals of a true pre-Raphaelite damsel but a raunchy pose beyond Burne Jones.

The blue handle of the Comte's cane at the top left of the canvas matches the blue of his cuff-stud at the bottom right. What a ponce. So far, so much like insipid appropriations of what Manet and Whistler had done already.

      "body": "<p><strong>Host:</strong> Dinny Hall<br> <strong>Location:</strong> Jewellery designer Dinny's home is a loft conversion in Hoxton, where she lives with record producer/writer Joe La Palaca and Dinny's five-year-old son, Lorcan.<br> <strong>Cost:</strong> \u00a3420 including wine (we splashed out, the prawns were \u00a3150).<br> <strong>Cooking Time:</strong> Half a day.<br> <strong>Clearing up Time:</strong> Since everyone helped it was really quick.</p> <p><strong>Have you always liked cooking?</strong><br> I was interested in cooking from a very early age. My parents loved to cook and when I was a child we used to go on family holidays to Italy and France where I saw the huge variety of fresh food available like rocket or endive, which were then a great luxury in Britain. For me cooking is another form of creativity. I like my food and my jewellery to look good and make you feel good. It's extraordinary how many designers are foodies, I think it's because there is such a visual element to preparing food. It can also be a fantastic distraction from the pressures of work. </p> <p><strong>Do you use any cookbooks?</strong><br> Current food fashions don't really concern me, I've got the Jamie Oliver cookbook but I rarely use it. Generally I don't like to follow rigid recipes. I never know what I'm going to cook. When I shop I'll have a rough idea of the overall flavours I'm in the mood for, then I'll buy lots of options and feel my way through when cooking. I don't measure anything out and I taste as I go along.</p> <p><strong>Are you a regular entertainer?</strong> <br> I've always cooked for hordes of people. At university I would often whip up a risotto at four in the morning for my friends. Nowadays I generally invite people whom I know well because I like to be relaxed. I never repeat the same dinner party dishes twice; I tend to do them, enjoy them, and forget them. There is a certain dread involved in having dinner parties, there's always an initial panic but once people have arrived it's always such a pleasure.</p> <p><strong>What about the preparations for tonight?</strong><br> Most of the food was bought at Selfridges Food Hall. It's fantastic for unusual ingredients so sometimes I pop in on the way back from my Pilates class. But really I'm a Waitrose girl, though I do enjoy Spitalfields market, and I often go to the farmers' market on Camden Passage. I've splashed out on tonight, as the prawns are expensive but could easily be replaced by salmon. I decided against having a sit down meal. Mingling is far more casual and you don't have to sit next to the same person. Barbecues are good for that because they are not that formal and my flat is perfect as it has a sheltered balcony which allows me to have barbecues all year round - even on rainy nights like tonight.</p> <p><strong>What is on the menu tonight?</strong><br> Food should be eclectic and lead from one taste to another but there should always be a central thread throughout the meal. Fish is the theme in this case. My dinners are usually influenced by the places I've been to and this meal brings back memories of Ko Lanta. I went there with Joe two weeks ago and I got very inspired by Thai cooking.</p> <p><strong>A Thai-inspired feast for 10 people: smoked duck, sizzling prawns, asparagus in lime</strong></p> <p>Recipes all serve 10 people</p> <p><strong>Starters: Warm Salad of Rocolla, red cabbage and smoked duck</strong></p> <p><strong>250 grams of Rocolla</strong><br><strong> 3 baby red cabbages, very finely chopped (alternatively 1/2 a small cabbage)</strong><br><strong> 3 Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored and cut into smallish pieces</strong><br><strong> 3-4 smoked duck breasts depending on size, with fat removed and cubed into approximately 2cm pieces</strong></p> <p><strong>Marinade for the duck</strong></p> <p><strong>1 tbsp Hoisin sauce</strong><br><strong> 1 tbsp roasted pumpkin seed oil</strong><br><strong> 1 small bunch of basil leaves, chopped</strong><br><strong> 1 tbsp of Teriaki sauce</strong></p> <p>Stir all these ingredients together, add to duck and marinate for several hours</p> <p><strong>Salad Dressing</strong></p> <p><strong>Combine 1 walnut oil to 1/2 bilberry red wine vinegar</strong><br><strong> 2 pinches of Malvern sea salt</strong><br><strong> 2 tsps of date syrup</strong></p> <p>Take care to dress the salad very lightly. I like to prepare it individually on each bowl: in a bed of Rocolla sprinkle the red cabbage and arrange the chopped apple over the top. Drizzle the dressing over the salad. In a lightly-greased wok, stir fry the duck on a hot heat. Cook for about 4-5 minutes. Drain juice ,top the salad with the hot duck and serve.</p> <p><strong>Main Course: Barbecued Giant Prawns</strong></p> <p>The prawns must be raw and as large as you can find with their shells on.</p> <p><strong>30 giant prawns (3 per person). </strong><br><strong> Marinade for the prawns</strong><br><strong> 6 lime leaves cut into thin strips</strong><br><strong> 6 cloves of garlic crushed</strong><br><strong> 3 bunches of spring onion chopped finely</strong><br><strong> 1 1/2 square inches of galangal</strong><br><strong> 4 tbsp Thai fish sauce</strong><br><strong> 4 tbsp sweet soy sauce (Indonesian)</strong><br><strong> 4 tbsp toasted sesame oil</strong><br><strong> 4-5 limes juiced</strong><br><strong> 2 tbsp of date syrup</strong><br><strong> 2 tbsp of rice oil</strong><br><strong> 1 small cup of chopped coriander</strong><br><strong> 1 red chilli finely chopped (the larger, milder sort)</strong></p> <p>Wash the prawns. Arrange on a large dish so that the marinade seeps through the shell. Leave for several hours in the fridge. Spoon marinade on prawns and flash cook on grill or barbecue: very large prawns take 4 and a half minutes each side.</p> <p><strong>Coconut Rice</strong></p> <p><strong>1kg Basmati or fragrant Thai rice</strong><br><strong> 850mls coconut milk</strong><br><strong> Malvern salt to taste</strong><br><strong> 4 tbsp white sesame seeds</strong><br><strong> rice or groundnut oil for frying</strong></p> <p>Crush the sesame seeds and two pinches of salt. Fry quickly in oil, stirring constantly. Cook the rice in the coconut milk adding enough water to reach 1? inches above the level of the rice, add salt to taste and bring to the boil. Simmer for just less the 20 minutes. You should not need to drain. Add sesame seeds and serve.</p> <p><strong>Asparagus in lime, butter and garlic</strong></p> <p><strong>1 lime, juiced</strong><br><strong> 55g butter</strong><br><strong> 2 cloves of garlic, crushed</strong><br><strong> Maldon sea salt</strong></p> <p>Steam or boil asparagus. Melt the butter, add crushed garlic and then the lime juice and pour over the asparagus and serve.</p> <p><strong>Dessert</strong></p> <p>Fruit salad of nectarine, strawberry, raspberry in cranberry and a dash of dessert wine with mango ice cream (H\u00e4agen-Dazs)</p> <p><strong>Wine</strong></p> <p>I bought 12 bottles at Majestic: Chateau de Sours Ros\u00e9 2000 \u00a36.99, Chateau Meana Ros\u00e9 2000 \u00a35.99, Orvieto Classico Mortaro \u00a34.49, Pinot Noir Ribeauville 1999 \u00a35.99, Chass Montrachet Clos St. Jean Premier Cru 1998 \u00a322.29, Chass Montrachet Fonbine- Gagnard Premier Cru 1997 \u00a319.99, Meursault 1998 \u00a314.99</p>",

Cost: \u00a3420 including wine (we splashed out, the prawns were \u00a3150). Cooking Time: Half a day. Clearing up Time: Since everyone helped it was really quick. Have you always liked cooking? I was interested in cooking from a very early age. My parents loved to cook and when I was a child we used to go on family holidays to Italy and France where I saw the huge variety of fresh food available like rocket or endive, which were then a great luxury in Britain. For me cooking is another form of creativity. I like my food and my jewellery to look good and make you feel good. It's extraordinary how many designers are foodies, I think it's because there is such a visual element to preparing food. It can also be a fantastic distraction from the pressures of work. Do you use any cookbooks? Current food fashions don't really concern me, I've got the Jamie Oliver cookbook but I rarely use it. Generally I don't like to follow rigid recipes. I never know what I'm going to cook. When I shop I'll have a rough idea of the overall flavours I'm in the mood for, then I'll buy lots of options and feel my way through when cooking. I don't measure anything out and I taste as I go along. Are you a regular entertainer? I've always cooked for hordes of people. At university I would often whip up a risotto at four in the morning for my friends. Nowadays I generally invite people whom I know well because I like to be relaxed. I never repeat the same dinner party dishes twice; I tend to do them, enjoy them, and forget them. There is a certain dread involved in having dinner parties, there's always an initial panic but once people have arrived it's always such a pleasure. What about the preparations for tonight? Most of the food was bought at Selfridges Food Hall. It's fantastic for unusual ingredients so sometimes I pop in on the way back from my Pilates class. But really I'm a Waitrose girl, though I do enjoy Spitalfields market, and I often go to the farmers' market on Camden Passage. I've splashed out on tonight, as the prawns are expensive but could easily be replaced by salmon. I decided against having a sit down meal. Mingling is far more casual and you don't have to sit next to the same person. Barbecues are good for that because they are not that formal and my flat is perfect as it has a sheltered balcony which allows me to have barbecues all year round - even on rainy nights like tonight. What is on the menu tonight? Food should be eclectic and lead from one taste to another but there should always be a central thread throughout the meal. Fish is the theme in this case. My dinners are usually influenced by the places I've been to and this meal brings back memories of Ko Lanta. I went there with Joe two weeks ago and I got very inspired by Thai cooking. A Thai-inspired feast for 10 people: smoked duck, sizzling prawns, asparagus in lime Recipes all serve 10 people Starters: Warm Salad of Rocolla, red cabbage and smoked duck 250 grams of Rocolla 3 baby red cabbages, very finely chopped (alternatively 1/2 a small cabbage) 3 Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored and cut into smallish pieces 3-4 smoked duck breasts depending on size, with fat removed and cubed into approximately 2cm pieces Marinade for the duck 1 tbsp Hoisin sauce 1 tbsp roasted pumpkin seed oil 1 small bunch of basil leaves, chopped 1 tbsp of Teriaki sauce Stir all these ingredients together, add to duck and marinate for several hours Salad Dressing Combine 1 walnut oil to 1/2 bilberry red wine vinegar 2 pinches of Malvern sea salt 2 tsps of date syrup Take care to dress the salad very lightly. I like to prepare it individually on each bowl: in a bed of Rocolla sprinkle the red cabbage and arrange the chopped apple over the top. Drizzle the dressing over the salad. In a lightly-greased wok, stir fry the duck on a hot heat. Cook for about 4-5 minutes. Drain juice ,top the salad with the hot duck and serve. Main Course: Barbecued Giant Prawns The prawns must be raw and as large as you can find with their shells on. 30 giant prawns (3 per person). Marinade for the prawns 6 lime leaves cut into thin strips 6 cloves of garlic crushed 3 bunches of spring onion chopped finely 1 1/2 square inches of galangal 4 tbsp Thai fish sauce 4 tbsp sweet soy sauce (Indonesian) 4 tbsp toasted sesame oil 4-5 limes juiced 2 tbsp of date syrup 2 tbsp of rice oil 1 small cup of chopped coriander 1 red chilli finely chopped (the larger, milder sort) Wash the prawns. Arrange on a large dish so that the marinade seeps through the shell. Leave for several hours in the fridge. Spoon marinade on prawns and flash cook on grill or barbecue: very large prawns take 4 and a half minutes each side. Coconut Rice 1kg Basmati or fragrant Thai rice 850mls coconut milk Malvern salt to taste 4 tbsp white sesame seeds rice or groundnut oil for frying Crush the sesame seeds and two pinches of salt. Fry quickly in oil, stirring constantly. Cook the rice in the coconut milk adding enough water to reach 1? inches above the level of the rice, add salt to taste and bring to the boil. Simmer for just less the 20 minutes. You should not need to drain. Add sesame seeds and serve. Asparagus in lime, butter and garlic 1 lime, juiced 55g butter 2 cloves of garlic, crushed Maldon sea salt Steam or boil asparagus. Melt the butter, add crushed garlic and then the lime juice and pour over the asparagus and serve. Dessert Fruit salad of nectarine, strawberry, raspberry in cranberry and a dash of dessert wine with mango ice cream (H\u00e4agen-Dazs) Wine I bought 12 bottles at Majestic: Chateau de Sours Ros\u00e9 2000 \u00a36.99, Chateau Meana Ros\u00e9 2000 \u00a35.99, Orvieto Classico Mortaro \u00a34.49, Pinot Noir Ribeauville 1999 \u00a35.99, Chass Montrachet Clos St. Jean Premier Cru 1998 \u00a322.29, Chass Montrachet Fonbine- Gagnard Premier Cru 1997 \u00a319.99, Meursault 1998 \u00a314.99",

As to who they were not, one answer in an unattributed leaflet was quite emphatic: \"We don't need self-proclaimed community leaders or council officials who have never cared about the area before trying to raise their status - they are all here with their own hidden agendas.\" Deprivation is another factor. I was in Bradford Three earlier this year and could not but be astonished by its Dickensian poverty and squalor. Parts of east Lancashire such as Burnley and Nelson, and the north Manchester satellite towns of Rochdale and Oldham are just as neglected. The conditions breed crime, much of it drug-related.

      "body": "<p>Of all the terrors offered by any half-decent restaurant, none can rival the full-scale panic attack of ordering the wine. Everything about the process is designed for maximum humiliation and minimum comfort. And of course the humiliation and discomfort increase exponentially with each extra person for whom you are ordering, so that selecting the wine for a group of 10 becomes a truly bowel-troubling experience. Select a pudding wine for the hors d'oeuvres course, and you may well have to change your name and move to Carlisle.</p> <p> Clearly the sensible thing to do is never accept the wine list. Always pass it on to someone - anyone - else. Nevertheless, there are occasions when this is simply impractical - dining alone, let's say, or a romantic date on which you hope to impress your companion, or when some spiteful bastard recommends that you should do the honours. In such cases there are certain rules to abide by if you wish to limit the excruciating embarrassments that lie in wait for you.</p> <p> First of all, avoid anything not written in English. Unfortunately, this is often not possible, especially in French restaurants, and most particularly in France. The rule here is not to try anything fancy, which translates as do not try anything red. If Burgundy means to you the colour of a sofa and claret another name for blood, then stick with 'blanc'. The big advantage with white wine is that it doesn't get life-damagingly expensive. But which white wine? Your gut instinct is 'House' but even you know that that sounds cheap. You could try asking the waiter for his recommendation but if he knows his stuff, he'll want to show up how little you know yours. That's where so-called New World wines come in. </p> <p>Now you could put their success down to what wine writers call 'fruity candour', but it's really about their idiot-proof labelling of 'Sauvignon' and 'Chardonnay'. So choose a mid-price range Sauvignon and look as if it isn't the first time you've ever laid eyes on its name.

      "bodyText": "Of all the terrors offered by any half-decent restaurant, none can rival the full-scale panic attack of ordering the wine. Everything about the process is designed for maximum humiliation and minimum comfort. And of course the humiliation and discomfort increase exponentially with each extra person for whom you are ordering, so that selecting the wine for a group of 10 becomes a truly bowel-troubling experience. Select a pudding wine for the hors d'oeuvres course, and you may well have to change your name and move to Carlisle. Clearly the sensible thing to do is never accept the wine list. Always pass it on to someone - anyone - else. Nevertheless, there are occasions when this is simply impractical - dining alone, let's say, or a romantic date on which you hope to impress your companion, or when some spiteful bastard recommends that you should do the honours. In such cases there are certain rules to abide by if you wish to limit the excruciating embarrassments that lie in wait for you. First of all, avoid anything not written in English. Unfortunately, this is often not possible, especially in French restaurants, and most particularly in France. The rule here is not to try anything fancy, which translates as do not try anything red. If Burgundy means to you the colour of a sofa and claret another name for blood, then stick with 'blanc'. The big advantage with white wine is that it doesn't get life-damagingly expensive. But which white wine? Your gut instinct is 'House' but even you know that that sounds cheap. You could try asking the waiter for his recommendation but if he knows his stuff, he'll want to show up how little you know yours. That's where so-called New World wines come in. Now you could put their success down to what wine writers call 'fruity candour', but it's really about their idiot-proof labelling of 'Sauvignon' and 'Chardonnay'. So choose a mid-price range Sauvignon and look as if it isn't the first time you've ever laid eyes on its name. But don't get carried away and start acting imperious with the waiter - no dismissive gestures, no contemptuous snarl as you hand back the list. He knows you're a fraud, so don't provoke him. That's the easy bit over. Now comes the tasting. First of all the waiter will show you the bottle you've just ordered.

This time he said yes, and went into partnership with De Niro and Nieporent to open Nobu.</p> <p>By then, Ruth Reichl was editing the restaurant reviews at the New York Times. 'He was really lucky - or smart - to partner with Drew Nieporent, who has a very big reputation here,' she says. 'Matsuhisa had wonderful food, but it had never been very well run in the front of the house. They combined his reputation as an innovative chef with a great interior design, and people who really knew how to run the place. It was - it is - an extremely well-run restaurant. And again, he's always had a very good-looking clientele there. It's always been filled with models and movie stars - and having Robert De Niro as one of the owners doesn't hurt.'</p> <p>Ritchie Notar, now Nobu's head of operations and a partner in the Malibu Nobu, was taken on to help with the New York launch in 1994. He'd worked at the ultra-cool Studio 54 disco at its peak, so he knew how to work a room, to manage celebrity egos. More importantly, they knew him. But he says he still made mistakes at first. With celebrities, he says, 'You want to seat them strategically so that they can see each other, but they're not sitting next to each other.'</p> <p>He learned this in the opening week. Francis Ford Coppola was in, and when Harvey Keitel arrived from his home across the street, he sat them close together. 'You could just feel the bad vibes. Then I found out that Harvey Keitel was the original actor in Apocalypse Now, before Martin Sheen. He had a big row with Coppola, left the set and they haven't spoken since. So what do I do? Sit them next to each other. Stupid. That's why I now read the gossip magazines.</p> <p>'In a way Studio 54 prepped me for Nobu, because it's almost like the velvet rope again. It's very difficult to get in, and our wait list is phenomenal. You get a lot of big egos and famous people, and they have to be handled sometimes with kid gloves, but also you have to be somewhat firm. Once you're full up, what can you do?'</p> <p>All the Nobu staff have their favourite celebrity stories. After the riding accident which left him paralysed, Christopher Reeves's wheelchair was too big to manoeuvre into the compact LA and New York restaurants. But one night Nobu arranged a private room for the actor at the TriBeCa Grill, cooked in his own kitchen and then ran down the block with each course. Al Gore also came to the New York restaurant, preceded by bomb-sniffing dogs and security men who shut off the entire street. 'All that,' says Notar, 'just for sashimi salad.' There was also the time golfer Nick Faldo booked the New York Nobu for a private party, and Prince Andrew was among the guests. Someone asked if the prince would have his photograph taken with Nobu, who was working that night. Andrew apparently looked Nobu up and down, took in his kitchen uniform, and haughtily said no. Afterwards, when a bodyguard had explained that this was not just a chef, but the head of the whole Nobu empire, he changed his mind.</p> <p>'You know what I said?' laughs Nobu. 'I said no.' The Prince doesn't seem to have minded: he's a regular at the restaurant in Park Lane.</p> <p>Nobu cooks for Oscar parties every year, and for the big US music awards, the Grammies. Probably the biggest event, though, was an Armani party for 1,200 people in Milan two years ago. Nobu's executive chef Mark Edwards assigned his team at the London restaurant to gather all the food together, packed two-and-a-half tons of it into polystyrene containers at 4am, then flew to Italy with it on a specially chartered cargo plane. 'We had it all in Milan and we were preparing it by eight o'clock in the morning,' he recalls. 'I had nine chefs there to finish it off and do the party. I didn't sleep in three days. I don't know how much it cost, but it must have been phenomenal.'</p> <p>After New York, the expansion was rapid. When Singaporean entrepreneurs B.S. and Christina Ong opened the sleek, modern Metropolitan Hotel on London's Park Lane four years ago, Nobu got the stylish setting it needed for its first European venture; the Ongs persuaded everyone from Madonna to Princess Di to eat in the first-floor restaurant. Mark Edwards was recruited from Vong to run the kitchen, and it gained a coveted Michelin star within a year - something Edwards still finds flattering, but funny. 'I didn't think they gave them to restaurants without tablecloths.'</p> <p>Nobu has successfully taken his experimental cuisine back home with a Tokyo Nobu, and when Georgio Armani opened his new flagship store in Milan last month, Nobu again found a chic fashion setting; Armani, meanwhile, got the A-list celebrity Robert De Niro at his opening. Notoriously media-shy, De Niro will nonetheless use his status to promote Nobu when it matters. This is no Planet Hollywood operation, but his presence at a launch party or press conference always guarantees coverage. And when the restaurant applied for its liquor licence in Las Vegas, it was the actor who went to the hearing. An active partner, he often travels with Nobu to check out new locations - they recently visited Moscow together.</p> <p>They have had offers from all over the globe, says Ritchie Notar. They were in Brazil last year, and in Africa before that. A sushi-loving sheik has made an interesting offer in Dubai. 'The first thing we'll do is check the chefs, and go to the fish markets,' he says, before adding wearily, 'I've seen more fish markets than I care to, but Nobu always spends extra time there.'</p> <p>But still, Notar feels that a proposed Sydney Nobu may well be the last. Nobuyuki Matsuhisa is 51 now, and there is only so much travelling one chef can do. His base is in Los Angeles, but he also has homes in New York and Tokyo and shuttles between his other restaurants, spending as much time in the kitchen as he can. One daughter works in Nobu Tokyo, the other is studying fashion in London at Central St Martins. In the week we met, Nobu had flown to London from Tokyo, calling in at Milan then travelling back to London to have dinner with his daughter at The Ivy, before going home to LA.</p> <p>In New York they've opened Nobu Next Door: a noisier, more relaxed restaurant actually a few doors down from the original Nobu with a no-reservations policy (and huge queues at peak times as a result). In Park Lane, they've coped with the demand at weekends by opening the White Room: a candlelit area with music where diners can eat on big communal tables without reservations. This, Notar feels, may be the future for Nobu if it wishes to expand further: less formal, complicated restaurants with simpler menus and no sushi bar or omakase (chef's choice) requiring highly specialised chefs.

      "bodyText": "For the next four years, De Niro continued to dine at Matsuhisa, although New York was never mentioned by the two men. But then he called again. He'd found another property just down the block in now-fashionable TriBeCa, and wanted to know if Nobu felt ready yet. The chef still gets emotional when talking about how his friend waited for him. This time he said yes, and went into partnership with De Niro and Nieporent to open Nobu. By then, Ruth Reichl was editing the restaurant reviews at the New York Times. 'He was really lucky - or smart - to partner with Drew Nieporent, who has a very big reputation here,' she says. 'Matsuhisa had wonderful food, but it had never been very well run in the front of the house. They combined his reputation as an innovative chef with a great interior design, and people who really knew how to run the place. It was - it is - an extremely well-run restaurant. And again, he's always had a very good-looking clientele there. It's always been filled with models and movie stars - and having Robert De Niro as one of the owners doesn't hurt.' Ritchie Notar, now Nobu's head of operations and a partner in the Malibu Nobu, was taken on to help with the New York launch in 1994. He'd worked at the ultra-cool Studio 54 disco at its peak, so he knew how to work a room, to manage celebrity egos. More importantly, they knew him. But he says he still made mistakes at first. With celebrities, he says, 'You want to seat them strategically so that they can see each other, but they're not sitting next to each other.' He learned this in the opening week. Francis Ford Coppola was in, and when Harvey Keitel arrived from his home across the street, he sat them close together. 'You could just feel the bad vibes. Then I found out that Harvey Keitel was the original actor in Apocalypse Now, before Martin Sheen. He had a big row with Coppola, left the set and they haven't spoken since. So what do I do? Sit them next to each other. Stupid. That's why I now read the gossip magazines. 'In a way Studio 54 prepped me for Nobu, because it's almost like the velvet rope again. It's very difficult to get in, and our wait list is phenomenal. You get a lot of big egos and famous people, and they have to be handled sometimes with kid gloves, but also you have to be somewhat firm. Once you're full up, what can you do?' All the Nobu staff have their favourite celebrity stories. After the riding accident which left him paralysed, Christopher Reeves's wheelchair was too big to manoeuvre into the compact LA and New York restaurants. But one night Nobu arranged a private room for the actor at the TriBeCa Grill, cooked in his own kitchen and then ran down the block with each course. Al Gore also came to the New York restaurant, preceded by bomb-sniffing dogs and security men who shut off the entire street. 'All that,' says Notar, 'just for sashimi salad.' There was also the time golfer Nick Faldo booked the New York Nobu for a private party, and Prince Andrew was among the guests. Someone asked if the prince would have his photograph taken with Nobu, who was working that night. Andrew apparently looked Nobu up and down, took in his kitchen uniform, and haughtily said no. Afterwards, when a bodyguard had explained that this was not just a chef, but the head of the whole Nobu empire, he changed his mind. 'You know what I said?' laughs Nobu. 'I said no.' The Prince doesn't seem to have minded: he's a regular at the restaurant in Park Lane. Nobu cooks for Oscar parties every year, and for the big US music awards, the Grammies. Probably the biggest event, though, was an Armani party for 1,200 people in Milan two years ago. Nobu's executive chef Mark Edwards assigned his team at the London restaurant to gather all the food together, packed two-and-a-half tons of it into polystyrene containers at 4am, then flew to Italy with it on a specially chartered cargo plane. 'We had it all in Milan and we were preparing it by eight o'clock in the morning,' he recalls. 'I had nine chefs there to finish it off and do the party. I didn't sleep in three days. I don't know how much it cost, but it must have been phenomenal.' After New York, the expansion was rapid. When Singaporean entrepreneurs B.S. and Christina Ong opened the sleek, modern Metropolitan Hotel on London's Park Lane four years ago, Nobu got the stylish setting it needed for its first European venture; the Ongs persuaded everyone from Madonna to Princess Di to eat in the first-floor restaurant. Mark Edwards was recruited from Vong to run the kitchen, and it gained a coveted Michelin star within a year - something Edwards still finds flattering, but funny. 'I didn't think they gave them to restaurants without tablecloths.' Nobu has successfully taken his experimental cuisine back home with a Tokyo Nobu, and when Georgio Armani opened his new flagship store in Milan last month, Nobu again found a chic fashion setting; Armani, meanwhile, got the A-list celebrity Robert De Niro at his opening. Notoriously media-shy, De Niro will nonetheless use his status to promote Nobu when it matters. This is no Planet Hollywood operation, but his presence at a launch party or press conference always guarantees coverage. And when the restaurant applied for its liquor licence in Las Vegas, it was the actor who went to the hearing. An active partner, he often travels with Nobu to check out new locations - they recently visited Moscow together. They have had offers from all over the globe, says Ritchie Notar. They were in Brazil last year, and in Africa before that. A sushi-loving sheik has made an interesting offer in Dubai. 'The first thing we'll do is check the chefs, and go to the fish markets,' he says, before adding wearily, 'I've seen more fish markets than I care to, but Nobu always spends extra time there.' But still, Notar feels that a proposed Sydney Nobu may well be the last. Nobuyuki Matsuhisa is 51 now, and there is only so much travelling one chef can do. His base is in Los Angeles, but he also has homes in New York and Tokyo and shuttles between his other restaurants, spending as much time in the kitchen as he can. One daughter works in Nobu Tokyo, the other is studying fashion in London at Central St Martins. In the week we met, Nobu had flown to London from Tokyo, calling in at Milan then travelling back to London to have dinner with his daughter at The Ivy, before going home to LA. In New York they've opened Nobu Next Door: a noisier, more relaxed restaurant actually a few doors down from the original Nobu with a no-reservations policy (and huge queues at peak times as a result). In Park Lane, they've coped with the demand at weekends by opening the White Room: a candlelit area with music where diners can eat on big communal tables without reservations. This, Notar feels, may be the future for Nobu if it wishes to expand further: less formal, complicated restaurants with simpler menus and no sushi bar or omakase (chef's choice) requiring highly specialised chefs. Two pared-down restaurants have already been opened using the name Ubon (Nobu backwards) in Beverly Hills and London's Docklands. In the meantime, Nobu is working on his first cookery book, putting down his life's work for posterity. To Mark Edwards, the appeal of Nobu's cooking is its flexibility. 'There's so much room in a Nobu kitchen to experiment, there are no restrictions. And the ingredients you have are always the best.' Anything can be used, as long as the cooking techniques are Japanese, relying on freshness, quality and, above all, simplicity. 'Nothing too complicated, there's never more than three flavours in a dish.' For the Milan opening, Edwards created dishes made with local ingredients such as porcini and truffles. Each new restaurant, he says, contributes new ideas to the others. 'It's like a recipe book that is always growing.' The logistics of running such an empire are extraordinary. Fish is flown in to the restaurants from all over the world. Soft-shell crabs and rock shrimps from the Pacific coast of the US; snow crab and king crab from Alaska; tiger prawns from Australia and Thailand; sea urchin from Japan. The chefs also use as much local seafood as possible: in the London restaurants, that means Scottish salmon and scallops, Dover sole, clams, sea bass and eels as well as more esoteric seafood such as buttery halibut cheeks or monkfish livers. In a scene straight out of Silence of the Lambs, Edwards takes me into the bowels of the Metropolitan hotel to see the lock-up garage where he keeps his tuna. It's kept at temperatures below -600C in a freezer he had specially made by a company whose main clients are hospital morgues. 'They were quite surprised when I said I was going to put fish in it.' Premium tuna costs \u00a318-25 per kilo. The Park Lane Nobu gets through 12,500 kilos a year. As for the black cod in miso that has become one of Nobu's signature dishes, it's made from a species of cod that lives in very cold water. Nobu discovered it in Alaska, but his current supply comes from around Chile. Edwards was once offered \u00a350,000 by a competitor to reveal the exact source. He refused. I ask Nobu if this worries him, but he laughs and says his secret is safe. 'The company who supply me the black cod do business with us by the container, not by the piece,' he points out. 'They have to keep it just for me, because it's a million-dollar business.'

      "body": "<p>Chef Nobuyuki Matsuhisa says that his restaurant in Los Angeles is lucky. If Oscar nominees come to eat there just before the ceremony, they tend to win. Robin Williams had been up for an award three times without success, but when he brought his family to Matsuhisa on the eve of the 1998 Oscars, Nobuyuki - more commonly known as Nobu - offered his congratulations in advance. 'He doesn't drink, but I sent a bottle of Cristal Roederer champagne over anyway, because I knew he'd win.' Sure enough, Williams walked off with an Oscar for Good Will Hunting. The following year Roberto Benigni was so pleased that the place had brought him luck that, after picking up his statuette for Life is Beautiful, he skipped the big parties to eat at Matsuhisa again. The whole restaurant, Nobu recalls proudly, stood up to applaud him.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Nobu restaurant on the first floor of Park Lane's ultra-fashionable Metropolitan Hotel was recently dubbed 'knickers-off Nobu' by the Evening Standard, who used the last few months' tabloid gossip to back up their claim that it is 'the randiest, sexiest, most lascivious restaurant in London'. At the end of last year, Bush singer Gavin Rossdale met Andrea Corr there; Gwyneth Paltrow was photographed kissing an unidentified man by the entrance; Rod Stewart's ex-wife Rachel Hunter stepped out with actor Mark Wahlberg; and Liam Gallagher and Nicole Appleton chose the restaurant for their first public outing as a couple. In January, England manager Sven Goran-Eriksson was seen dining there with his girlfriend Nancy Dell'Olio, while Harrison Ford - also recently separated from his wife - was there with a 'mystery blonde'. Dani Behr chowed down with J from 5ive, former escort of sporty Spice Girl Mel C, while David Coulthard effectively ended his engagement by dining with a girl who was not his fianc\u00e9e, then going upstairs to share a bath with her. And of course, there was Boris Becker. He enjoyed a dinner at Nobu with Russian model Angela Ermakowa after Wimbledon in 1999 which led, in March 2000, to the birth of his daughter Anna. Prior to a court case in February, there were some nonsensical accusation involving stolen sperm, a turkey baster and a Russian mafia blackmail plot, but eventually the tennis star came clean: his baby was conceived in a post-sushi tryst in one of the Metropolitan hotel's linen cupboards.</p> <p>As well as the luckiest restaurant in Los Angeles and the sexiest restaurant in London, Nobu's empire has expanded to Miami, Las Vegas, Malibu, Tokyo and Milan, with a thirteenth restaurant opening this month in Paris. If you want a weekend reservation at any of them, be sure to call several weeks in advance (unless you're a celebrity of course, in which case you'll have the number for the special VIP reservations line). Robin Leigh, the manager of the Park Lane branch, says he's been offered up to \u00a31,000 by people desperate to get a table at short notice. Once inside, you'll be dining with pop stars, politicians, actors, supermodels and royalty, and although each restaurant is different, they all share similar attitudes. The design is always sleek and chic without being too formal. The food is light and healthy, but it's also elegant and reassuringly expensive. As for the service, Nobu is the kind of place where everyone knows who you are, but no one makes a great deal of fuss about it.</p> <p>Celebrity party organiser Fran Cutler often eats at the Park Lane Nobu with her business partner Meg Matthews or other famous friends such as Kate Moss. 'It's very central, and it's not as uptight as a lot of good restaurants. You can dress up, but you don't necessarily have to. Celebrities like it because the service is great, but everyone gets treated the same. And the food is a whole experience: your tastebuds are pushed from pillar to post. They do a wicked mushroom salad, then you get the rock shrimps, the black cod, the sak\u00e9 with gold leaf in it ... There's always something different to try. You could eat there every night and not get tired of it.' It's a formula that has served its owner well. Listed in Forbes as one of the top five money earners in his profession, Nobu is on first-name terms with many of Hollywood's \u00e9lite. He plays celebrity golf tournaments partnering Celine Dion. He has appeared in a Gap ad photographed by Herb Ritts. He has prepared private dinners for Bill and Hillary Clinton. He's even had a role in a big movie, playing a high-rolling Japanese gambler alongside Robert De Niro in the Las Vegas mob movie Casino. Thanks to his innovative cuisine and a chance meeting with an actor one night at the tiny eight-seat sushi bar in Matsuhisa, Nobu is the most famous sushi chef in the world.</p> <p>Nobuyuki Matsuhisa was eight when his older brother took him to a sushi restaurant for the first time. It was about a year after their father, an architect, had been killed in a car accident. When Nobu passed through the sliding door into the restaurant, he says it felt like entering different world. 'The smells, the beautiful selection of fish The first time I went into a sushi restaurant, I knew my future - I wanted to be a sushi chef.' He started his rigorous seven-year training at the age of 18, getting up at dawn to go to Tokyo's vast Tsujiki fish market, then working in his mentor's restaurant until the last customers left at night, after which he cleaned up and slept on the floor. He got just two days a month off and earned a pittance. And he did this for three years before he was allowed to even start learning to make sushi. 'I had a lot of patience,' he says, 'because I loved this job. But I was enjoying it too. I like to see fish, and I went to the fish market every morning. I got to open the restaurant and see the customers. My mentor was making sushi, so I could watch him all the time. As he worked I'd be copying him under the table, just practising with my fingers.' When I ask what all this practice was for, what makes good sushi, he finds it hard to answer in words. The fish has to be fresh, he says. The rice has to be cooked perfectly. The combination of the two has to be harmonious, with the shaped rice matched exactly to the size of the fish slice. The entire bundle has to be packed together in a way that is not too hard, not too soft. But most of all, it has to have heart. 'I know the best way because I've been doing it for a long time, but to younger people, sushi means sushi rice, sliced fish. They make something that looks like sushi, but it doesn't have heart like mine.'</p> <p>Nobu married after finishing his training, and soon after, in 1972, a Japanese-Peruvian businessman who came to the restaurant whenever he was in Tokyo invited him to come to Lima and open a traditional Japanese restaurant catering to executives at the big Japanese corporations with offices there. Nobu had always wanted to travel. There was a photograph he treasured of his father with some colourfully dressed local people in the Philippines. 'Whenever I missed my father, I looked at that picture and thought that one day, I'd like to go out of the country. It was a dream.'</p> <p>For Nobu, happiness is directly linked to the quality of the local seafood. The fish was good in Peru, straight out of the Pacific Ocean. But after his rigorous training in Japanese cooking traditions that have scarcely changed for generations, he was excited too by the local cuisine, full of unfamiliar flavours such as garlic and chillies. The South Americans even had their own way of eating raw fish - ceviche, where the flesh is marinated in citrus juice. After three years in Peru, his partners asked him to economise on his ingredients and rather than compromise his art, he moved to Argentina.

A year later he went back to Japan, but after the big house, maid and gardeners they'd enjoyed in South America, life in a cramped Tokyo apartment was difficult.</p> <p>So he took out a loan and moved with his young family to Anchorage, Alaska, where the fish was excellent. Money was tight so he did much of the building work for his new restaurant himself, as well as all the cooking. At the end of 1980, he took his first day off for months to celebrate Thanksgiving Day. He was at a friend's house enjoying a turkey dinner when the call came to say the restaurant was on fire. He got there in time to watch it burn to the ground. It's one of his worst memories, he says. There was no insurance, and nearly all the money he'd used to set up the place was borrowed.

He began using garlic, chilli and coriander alongside traditional Japanese flavours like ginger and soy, and introduced new ingredients such as olive oil, truffles and foie gras. When a customer sent back a plate of sashimi, unwilling to eat raw fish, Nobu made a quick marinade for the slices and then poured hot oil over them, searing the outside so they looked more palatable to Western eyes: the 'new style sashimi' that remains on his menus to this day. Ruth Reichl, editor of the glossy US food magazine Gourmet, was then at the Los Angeles Times in charge of restaurant reviews. 'We had a critic who was married to a Japanese woman, they ate there in its first week and said it was extraordinary. It wasn't like sushi he'd ever tried before.

      "bodyText": "Chef Nobuyuki Matsuhisa says that his restaurant in Los Angeles is lucky. If Oscar nominees come to eat there just before the ceremony, they tend to win. Robin Williams had been up for an award three times without success, but when he brought his family to Matsuhisa on the eve of the 1998 Oscars, Nobuyuki - more commonly known as Nobu - offered his congratulations in advance. 'He doesn't drink, but I sent a bottle of Cristal Roederer champagne over anyway, because I knew he'd win.' Sure enough, Williams walked off with an Oscar for Good Will Hunting. The following year Roberto Benigni was so pleased that the place had brought him luck that, after picking up his statuette for Life is Beautiful, he skipped the big parties to eat at Matsuhisa again. The whole restaurant, Nobu recalls proudly, stood up to applaud him. Meanwhile, the Nobu restaurant on the first floor of Park Lane's ultra-fashionable Metropolitan Hotel was recently dubbed 'knickers-off Nobu' by the Evening Standard, who used the last few months' tabloid gossip to back up their claim that it is 'the randiest, sexiest, most lascivious restaurant in London'. At the end of last year, Bush singer Gavin Rossdale met Andrea Corr there; Gwyneth Paltrow was photographed kissing an unidentified man by the entrance; Rod Stewart's ex-wife Rachel Hunter stepped out with actor Mark Wahlberg; and Liam Gallagher and Nicole Appleton chose the restaurant for their first public outing as a couple. In January, England manager Sven Goran-Eriksson was seen dining there with his girlfriend Nancy Dell'Olio, while Harrison Ford - also recently separated from his wife - was there with a 'mystery blonde'. Dani Behr chowed down with J from 5ive, former escort of sporty Spice Girl Mel C, while David Coulthard effectively ended his engagement by dining with a girl who was not his fianc\u00e9e, then going upstairs to share a bath with her. And of course, there was Boris Becker. He enjoyed a dinner at Nobu with Russian model Angela Ermakowa after Wimbledon in 1999 which led, in March 2000, to the birth of his daughter Anna. Prior to a court case in February, there were some nonsensical accusation involving stolen sperm, a turkey baster and a Russian mafia blackmail plot, but eventually the tennis star came clean: his baby was conceived in a post-sushi tryst in one of the Metropolitan hotel's linen cupboards. As well as the luckiest restaurant in Los Angeles and the sexiest restaurant in London, Nobu's empire has expanded to Miami, Las Vegas, Malibu, Tokyo and Milan, with a thirteenth restaurant opening this month in Paris. If you want a weekend reservation at any of them, be sure to call several weeks in advance (unless you're a celebrity of course, in which case you'll have the number for the special VIP reservations line). Robin Leigh, the manager of the Park Lane branch, says he's been offered up to \u00a31,000 by people desperate to get a table at short notice. Once inside, you'll be dining with pop stars, politicians, actors, supermodels and royalty, and although each restaurant is different, they all share similar attitudes. The design is always sleek and chic without being too formal. The food is light and healthy, but it's also elegant and reassuringly expensive. As for the service, Nobu is the kind of place where everyone knows who you are, but no one makes a great deal of fuss about it. Celebrity party organiser Fran Cutler often eats at the Park Lane Nobu with her business partner Meg Matthews or other famous friends such as Kate Moss. 'It's very central, and it's not as uptight as a lot of good restaurants. You can dress up, but you don't necessarily have to. Celebrities like it because the service is great, but everyone gets treated the same. And the food is a whole experience: your tastebuds are pushed from pillar to post. They do a wicked mushroom salad, then you get the rock shrimps, the black cod, the sak\u00e9 with gold leaf in it ... There's always something different to try. You could eat there every night and not get tired of it.' It's a formula that has served its owner well. Listed in Forbes as one of the top five money earners in his profession, Nobu is on first-name terms with many of Hollywood's \u00e9lite. He plays celebrity golf tournaments partnering Celine Dion. He has appeared in a Gap ad photographed by Herb Ritts. He has prepared private dinners for Bill and Hillary Clinton. He's even had a role in a big movie, playing a high-rolling Japanese gambler alongside Robert De Niro in the Las Vegas mob movie Casino. Thanks to his innovative cuisine and a chance meeting with an actor one night at the tiny eight-seat sushi bar in Matsuhisa, Nobu is the most famous sushi chef in the world. Nobuyuki Matsuhisa was eight when his older brother took him to a sushi restaurant for the first time. It was about a year after their father, an architect, had been killed in a car accident. When Nobu passed through the sliding door into the restaurant, he says it felt like entering different world. 'The smells, the beautiful selection of fish The first time I went into a sushi restaurant, I knew my future - I wanted to be a sushi chef.' He started his rigorous seven-year training at the age of 18, getting up at dawn to go to Tokyo's vast Tsujiki fish market, then working in his mentor's restaurant until the last customers left at night, after which he cleaned up and slept on the floor. He got just two days a month off and earned a pittance. And he did this for three years before he was allowed to even start learning to make sushi. 'I had a lot of patience,' he says, 'because I loved this job. But I was enjoying it too. I like to see fish, and I went to the fish market every morning. I got to open the restaurant and see the customers. My mentor was making sushi, so I could watch him all the time. As he worked I'd be copying him under the table, just practising with my fingers.' When I ask what all this practice was for, what makes good sushi, he finds it hard to answer in words. The fish has to be fresh, he says. The rice has to be cooked perfectly. The combination of the two has to be harmonious, with the shaped rice matched exactly to the size of the fish slice. The entire bundle has to be packed together in a way that is not too hard, not too soft. But most of all, it has to have heart. 'I know the best way because I've been doing it for a long time, but to younger people, sushi means sushi rice, sliced fish. They make something that looks like sushi, but it doesn't have heart like mine.' Nobu married after finishing his training, and soon after, in 1972, a Japanese-Peruvian businessman who came to the restaurant whenever he was in Tokyo invited him to come to Lima and open a traditional Japanese restaurant catering to executives at the big Japanese corporations with offices there. Nobu had always wanted to travel. There was a photograph he treasured of his father with some colourfully dressed local people in the Philippines. 'Whenever I missed my father, I looked at that picture and thought that one day, I'd like to go out of the country. It was a dream.' For Nobu, happiness is directly linked to the quality of the local seafood. The fish was good in Peru, straight out of the Pacific Ocean. But after his rigorous training in Japanese cooking traditions that have scarcely changed for generations, he was excited too by the local cuisine, full of unfamiliar flavours such as garlic and chillies. The South Americans even had their own way of eating raw fish - ceviche, where the flesh is marinated in citrus juice. After three years in Peru, his partners asked him to economise on his ingredients and rather than compromise his art, he moved to Argentina. The fish was good there too, but the people weren't quite ready for sushi. A year later he went back to Japan, but after the big house, maid and gardeners they'd enjoyed in South America, life in a cramped Tokyo apartment was difficult. So he took out a loan and moved with his young family to Anchorage, Alaska, where the fish was excellent. Money was tight so he did much of the building work for his new restaurant himself, as well as all the cooking. At the end of 1980, he took his first day off for months to celebrate Thanksgiving Day.

      "body": "<p>Ren\u00e9e Elliott is in her kitchen, which means she's in her element. It's a sunny day, her pet budgie is tweeting from his perch upstairs, and Elliott, 36, the woman who founded Planet Organic, is cutting huge chunks of Irish soda bread. She baked it the night before, using spelt instead of traditional wheat flour, and big, juicy, organic sultanas. The heart of her kitchen is her oven. 'It had to be a gas hob and an electric oven,' she says in her soft American accent. 'I love baking. My mother has love and baking all mixed up, and I do too. There is nothing as simple as baking a loaf of bread or a cake. It gives me such satisfaction.' And seeing people enjoy the fruits of her baking sessions pleases her even more. At Christmas and Easter, she bakes cookies for all 100 of her staff. Hours of work is scoffed in minutes. But it's worth it. It makes a difference.</p> <p> 'I sound like the happy homebaker, don't I?' she laughs. But she's far from it. She bakes at weekends for recreation, just as other people might go to the gym, take a walk, or watch a film. The rest of the time, she is busy honing and developing her business, which began in 1995 with a shop in Westbourne Grove, and grew last year into a second super cool supermarket, with everything from a juice bar to a cake counter, just off London's Tottenham Court Road. That she works in the food industry is perhaps inevitable. 'My mom's from New Orleans, where it's all Cajun-Creole cookery. Food was so important as a child. Mom was always cooking, baking, feeding people.' Her father kept a small vegetable garden, which Elliott helped out on. When she left home to go to college, she says, she couldn't understand why the tomatoes didn't taste like they did at home. In 1985, as a student, she went travelling to Europe with her sister, and met her future husband in London. The following year, she realised it was more than a holiday romance and came back to stay. Planet Organic was inspired by a concept she had seen in America, and six years ago, she set about making it work here.</p> <p>The organic market has grown with her. 'Whenever there's a food scare, people turn to organic,' she says. 'A food scare makes people learn a bit more about conventional farming; it's not pretty.' She is on the council of the Soil Association, and is sure that the only way forward for British farmers is to go organic. 'In the beginning, I had two goals: one was to make organic mainstream, and the other was to change food retailing. But that happened in 1999 with GMOs [genetically modified organisms]. The supermarkets made it happen.' These days, it is possible - if expensive - to do your entire weekly shop at Planet Organic, from your floor cleaner to your Sunday morning croissants. But few are lucky enough to be able to shop for food daily, as Elliott does. It's one the perks of her trade. She likes her ingredients to be as fresh as possible, and says she only cooks as much as is needed for a meal: 'I hate leftovers.' The day we meet, she has already planned dinner that evening, and stocked up the vegetable drawers of her fridge with cauliflower, salad stuff and a couple of bulbs of fennel. She and her husband, Brian, who is also a director of the company, are both vegetarians.</p> <p>The kitchen is not grand - either in scale or content. There is no freestanding industrial cooker to double as a status symbol; no state-of-the-art stainless steel worktops or flashy lighting system. There isn't even a cool Waring juicer, because Elliott says she has all the fruit and vegetable juice she likes during the week at work, and she makes smoothies instead in her Moulinex blender at home at the weekends. The couple moved to their West London mews house two years ago, and are still in the process of decorating. They were happy with the kitchen, with its clean, wooden units, and functional Bosch appliances.</p> <p>It is not the kitchen of a show-off. But as soon as you open the cupboard doors, you realise that this is the domain of a serious cook. The KitchenAid food mixer on the worktop is already a clue. Elliott says she couldn't live without it. But the cupboards are crammed with loaf tins, pie tins, muffin trays, pancake griddles, and cookie presses. Out of one drawer she pulls a ginger grater, a pastry cutter (along with most of her baking tins, she brought it back from America because she couldn't find one here), a hand whisk, a garlic press, and a tiny, fluted, lemon tart tin, the size of a walnut. Open another drawer, and you find Elliott's spice and herb collection, in alphabetical order. They are stored in glass Schwartz bottles but are mostly from Hambleden Spices, a British company that supplies 90 per cent of organic spices. In the oven, there's a pizza stone, which is frequently used, especially by Brian, who might bake two different varieties for a dinner party. In the freezer there's an ice-cream maker, waiting for summer.</p> <p>There is just one, compact food cupboard, and it's packed with goodies, including a jar of Seggiano artichoke hearts (they don't have an official Soil Association stamp, but according to Elliott, 'they're the best in the world - I know the farmer doesn't spray or use pesticides') a bag of dates, some hemp and spelt pasta, brown basmati rice as well as white arborio for risottos, a tin of baked beans, rice crackers and Quinoa black sesame snacks, and several bars of Green &amp; Blacks chocolate, because she is planning on baking a chocolate cake. There are also two packs of OAO spaghetti (the packaging is designed by Philippe Starck and yes, it's organic) and a corner of Japanese ingredients: wasabi, umeboshi paste, nori, kuzu root, used to thicken stews and sauces, and something called mochi, which, Elliott says, is a good staple to always have in the cupboard. 'They are little brown rice pillows - you put them under the grill and they puff up, and go all chewy and sweet.'</p> <p>The real secret of Ren\u00e9e Elliott's kitchen however, is nothing to do with American muffin tins or Japanese condiments. It is contained within an unobtrusive black ring-binder folder, in a short stack of recipe books, sandwiched between her own The Organic Cookbook, co-written with Eric Treuill\u00e9, (published by Dorling Kindersley) and Fields of Greens by Annie Somerville, from the San Francisco restaurant with the same name. The black folder is heavy with hand-written recipes, sent to Elliott by her mother back home. 'I never give out recipes,' she says darkly. 'It's a family secret.' And there is no way she is going to give anything more away - not even the recipe for her mom's delicious soda bread. </p> <p>\u0095 Planet Organic, 42 Westbourne Grove, London W2, and 22 Torrington Place, London W1; for mail order, ring 020 7221 1345.</p>",

She likes her ingredients to be as fresh as possible, and says she only cooks as much as is needed for a meal: 'I hate leftovers.' The day we meet, she has already planned dinner that evening, and stocked up the vegetable drawers of her fridge with cauliflower, salad stuff and a couple of bulbs of fennel. She and her husband, Brian, who is also a director of the company, are both vegetarians. The kitchen is not grand - either in scale or content. There is no freestanding industrial cooker to double as a status symbol; no state-of-the-art stainless steel worktops or flashy lighting system. There isn't even a cool Waring juicer, because Elliott says she has all the fruit and vegetable juice she likes during the week at work, and she makes smoothies instead in her Moulinex blender at home at the weekends. The couple moved to their West London mews house two years ago, and are still in the process of decorating. They were happy with the kitchen, with its clean, wooden units, and functional Bosch appliances. It is not the kitchen of a show-off. But as soon as you open the cupboard doors, you realise that this is the domain of a serious cook. The KitchenAid food mixer on the worktop is already a clue. Elliott says she couldn't live without it. But the cupboards are crammed with loaf tins, pie tins, muffin trays, pancake griddles, and cookie presses. Out of one drawer she pulls a ginger grater, a pastry cutter (along with most of her baking tins, she brought it back from America because she couldn't find one here), a hand whisk, a garlic press, and a tiny, fluted, lemon tart tin, the size of a walnut. Open another drawer, and you find Elliott's spice and herb collection, in alphabetical order. They are stored in glass Schwartz bottles but are mostly from Hambleden Spices, a British company that supplies 90 per cent of organic spices. In the oven, there's a pizza stone, which is frequently used, especially by Brian, who might bake two different varieties for a dinner party. In the freezer there's an ice-cream maker, waiting for summer. There is just one, compact food cupboard, and it's packed with goodies, including a jar of Seggiano artichoke hearts (they don't have an official Soil Association stamp, but according to Elliott, 'they're the best in the world - I know the farmer doesn't spray or use pesticides') a bag of dates, some hemp and spelt pasta, brown basmati rice as well as white arborio for risottos, a tin of baked beans, rice crackers and Quinoa black sesame snacks, and several bars of Green &amp; Blacks chocolate, because she is planning on baking a chocolate cake. There are also two packs of OAO spaghetti (the packaging is designed by Philippe Starck and yes, it's organic) and a corner of Japanese ingredients: wasabi, umeboshi paste, nori, kuzu root, used to thicken stews and sauces, and something called mochi, which, Elliott says, is a good staple to always have in the cupboard. 'They are little brown rice pillows - you put them under the grill and they puff up, and go all chewy and sweet.' The real secret of Ren\u00e9e Elliott's kitchen however, is nothing to do with American muffin tins or Japanese condiments. It is contained within an unobtrusive black ring-binder folder, in a short stack of recipe books, sandwiched between her own The Organic Cookbook, co-written with Eric Treuill\u00e9, (published by Dorling Kindersley) and Fields of Greens by Annie Somerville, from the San Francisco restaurant with the same name. The black folder is heavy with hand-written recipes, sent to Elliott by her mother back home. 'I never give out recipes,' she says darkly. 'It's a family secret.' And there is no way she is going to give anything more away - not even the recipe for her mom's delicious soda bread. \u0095 Planet Organic, 42 Westbourne Grove, London W2, and 22 Torrington Place, London W1; for mail order, ring 020 7221 1345.",

      "body": "<p>Aesthetically, my kitchen is a multi-cultural slice of 1970s Mediterraneana, though not the sort you would ever see within the pages of Wallpaper*. I call the look 'spaghetti west-end' (think Soho trattoria, circa '71) but in estate agentese this could translate into 'hacienda style' - as rendered by a blind Spaniard on hallucinogens. The 'design concept' behind my kitchen has about as much integrity as did the art direction during Elvis's 'Aloha Hawaii' period; even Abigail wouldn't want to throw a party in it.</p> <p>There is, for example, an arched entrance that lacks only a pair of swinging saloon doors to give it that New Mexican bodega-meets-Jean-Machine-changing-room effect. Then there's another arch over the groovy milk chocolate-coloured Spectrum range cooker (such a Seventies word 'Spectrum', particularly when rendered in a futuristic typeface and used to describe an object with a defunct rotisserie), which discreetly (unless one makes the mistake of turning it on) houses an asthmatic Vent-Axia extractor.</p> <p> At some point, in a Dali-esque DIY frenzy, the room's window frames were stained glossy caramel, turning perfectly acceptable Edwardian wood into 'wood-effect' wood. Other highlights include an interesting arrangement of pygmy cupboards with a striking hessian-style veneer, coupled with intriguingly greige-coloured worktops, splashbacks and a 'breakfast bar' constructed from wonky, germ-harbouring 'rustica' ceramic tiles. </p> <p>Though it was never my intention to do so, I've lived with this retro-feast for the last five years while making a part-time hobby of buying specialist adult publications and cruising Wigmore Street. Here, lured by the red lights - those naughty LED come-hither winks - every shop front, from Bulthaup to Magnet, boasts stickers marked 'NEW GRILLS!' next to the doorbells. Then there are the seductive accessories - the best reason to indulge in a wedding list, frankly - inside Divertimenti, kitchenware's answer to Agent Provocateur (and, as it happens, owned by my lovely godfather).</p> <p>Recently, some of my closest friends have been involved in traumatic house makeovers. I have not envied any of them the tears, teeth-gnashing, sleepless nights, writs and breakdowns, but the results have been universally spectacular. 'So it must have been worth it?' I inquired cheerily of one hollow-eyed friend as she gave me a tour, ending up in the epicentre of operations - a beautiful, fully-loaded, streamlined, gleaming Starship Enterprise of a gastropod. She raised an eyebrow: 'Wait till you see this...' she warned, opening the new dishwasher. 'It is so anal and over-designed that - look! - every single piece of cutlery has to be arranged in its own special holder. It takes twice as long to load the bloody thing as it does to wash it.'</p> <p>Without a dishwasher or even a grill (I'm sure the querulous Spectrum must have had one once) domestic inconvenience is relative. But, though pistachio with jealousy, I could see her point: indulging a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to realise her full culinary potential, my friend had been completely seduced by added extras. Sadly, the result could be a kitchen so demandingly hi-tech it provokes even domestic goddesses to kick holes in stained glass windows. If it's there you've got to use it, after all. You might creep in at midnight with intent to rustle up scrambled eggs on toast but the kitchen will sneer, preferring free-range huevos rancheros with a little insalata mixta on the side.</p> <p>So I've decided it's nothing as obviously straightforward as not being able to afford one that stops me going out tomorrow and ordering a new kitchen. It's simply that, due to the hacienda's obvious stylistic(not to mention practical) shortcomings (aside from the dead grill and the ex-rotisserie, only three of the Spectrum's four burners and one of its two ovens still works. And that's the oven the size of a mitt), my extraordinary culinary potential will remain mysteriously untapped through absolutely no fault of my own. Hell, if I replaced the kitchen, I'd have to justify it by giving regular dinner parties. Back, furtively, then to Wigmore Street where I can enjoy a fetish that, unlike dining, is most fun when indulged alone. Hasta la Vent-Axia, baby.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Aesthetically, my kitchen is a multi-cultural slice of 1970s Mediterraneana, though not the sort you would ever see within the pages of Wallpaper*. I call the look 'spaghetti west-end' (think Soho trattoria, circa '71) but in estate agentese this could translate into 'hacienda style' - as rendered by a blind Spaniard on hallucinogens. The 'design concept' behind my kitchen has about as much integrity as did the art direction during Elvis's 'Aloha Hawaii' period; even Abigail wouldn't want to throw a party in it. There is, for example, an arched entrance that lacks only a pair of swinging saloon doors to give it that New Mexican bodega-meets-Jean-Machine-changing-room effect. Then there's another arch over the groovy milk chocolate-coloured Spectrum range cooker (such a Seventies word 'Spectrum', particularly when rendered in a futuristic typeface and used to describe an object with a defunct rotisserie), which discreetly (unless one makes the mistake of turning it on) houses an asthmatic Vent-Axia extractor. At some point, in a Dali-esque DIY frenzy, the room's window frames were stained glossy caramel, turning perfectly acceptable Edwardian wood into 'wood-effect' wood. Other highlights include an interesting arrangement of pygmy cupboards with a striking hessian-style veneer, coupled with intriguingly greige-coloured worktops, splashbacks and a 'breakfast bar' constructed from wonky, germ-harbouring 'rustica' ceramic tiles. Though it was never my intention to do so, I've lived with this retro-feast for the last five years while making a part-time hobby of buying specialist adult publications and cruising Wigmore Street. Here, lured by the red lights - those naughty LED come-hither winks - every shop front, from Bulthaup to Magnet, boasts stickers marked 'NEW GRILLS!' next to the doorbells. Then there are the seductive accessories - the best reason to indulge in a wedding list, frankly - inside Divertimenti, kitchenware's answer to Agent Provocateur (and, as it happens, owned by my lovely godfather). Recently, some of my closest friends have been involved in traumatic house makeovers. I have not envied any of them the tears, teeth-gnashing, sleepless nights, writs and breakdowns, but the results have been universally spectacular. 'So it must have been worth it?' I inquired cheerily of one hollow-eyed friend as she gave me a tour, ending up in the epicentre of operations - a beautiful, fully-loaded, streamlined, gleaming Starship Enterprise of a gastropod. She raised an eyebrow: 'Wait till you see this...' she warned, opening the new dishwasher. 'It is so anal and over-designed that - look! - every single piece of cutlery has to be arranged in its own special holder. It takes twice as long to load the bloody thing as it does to wash it.' Without a dishwasher or even a grill (I'm sure the querulous Spectrum must have had one once) domestic inconvenience is relative. But, though pistachio with jealousy, I could see her point: indulging a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to realise her full culinary potential, my friend had been completely seduced by added extras. Sadly, the result could be a kitchen so demandingly hi-tech it provokes even domestic goddesses to kick holes in stained glass windows. If it's there you've got to use it, after all. You might creep in at midnight with intent to rustle up scrambled eggs on toast but the kitchen will sneer, preferring free-range huevos rancheros with a little insalata mixta on the side. So I've decided it's nothing as obviously straightforward as not being able to afford one that stops me going out tomorrow and ordering a new kitchen. It's simply that, due to the hacienda's obvious stylistic(not to mention practical) shortcomings (aside from the dead grill and the ex-rotisserie, only three of the Spectrum's four burners and one of its two ovens still works. And that's the oven the size of a mitt), my extraordinary culinary potential will remain mysteriously untapped through absolutely no fault of my own. Hell, if I replaced the kitchen, I'd have to justify it by giving regular dinner parties. Back, furtively, then to Wigmore Street where I can enjoy a fetish that, unlike dining, is most fun when indulged alone. Hasta la Vent-Axia, baby.",

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the manufacturers of supplements contend that it is, because supermarkets' lengthy storage times cause the levels of vitamin C, for example, in fresh produce to drop. I disagree: you can still glean your daily requirement of 60mg (about 30mg for children) of vitamin C if you eat some fresh or frozen produce every day. Smokers, however, need a whopping 2,000mg a day, so will probably need to take a supplement.) </p> <p>One of the most powerful antioxidant vitamins, vitamin C helps to reduce incidences of all types of disease, as well as assisting the body to absorb iron, which is why people who have iron-deficiency anaemia should accompany iron-rich meals with some fresh fruit or fruit juice. Foods that are packed with vitamin C include all fresh fruits and vegetables, but especially kiwi fruits, citrus fruits, blueberries, blackcurrants and grapefruits, along with broccoli, curly kale, spring greens and red and yellow peppers. As a guideline, one kiwi fruit contains about 50mg of vitamin C, while a large orange hits the 70mg mark, so if you manage to eat five portions of fresh fruit or vegetables a day your body will benefit hugely. Because vitamin C is water-soluble, it's best to steam or microwave vegetables rather than boiling them for long periods of time. </p> <p>If you do take a vitamin C supplement, don't have more than 500mg a day and monitor your reaction carefully if you have a sensitive digestive system - after all, vitamin C's alternative name is ascorbic acid, a concentrated dose of which may increase your stomach's acidity level.</p> <p><strong>And don't forget...</strong></p> <p>The low-fat, high-fibre lifestyle isn't necessarily the healthiest for young children. Although too many fatty or fried foods aren't good for them, it's important that their bodies receive enough fat to enable them to absorb the essential fat-soluble vitamins A, D and E, as well as to grow, so use olive and other vegetable oils or a small amount of butter when cooking and give them full-cream milk until they are five, as well as full-fat cheese and yoghurts. Phytates and oxalates in high-fibre foods can inhibit the body's absorption of the important growth nutrients calcium and iron, so save high-fibre cereal foods for when they're in their teens and stick to white bread, rice and pasta for now. Their daily diet should include plenty of fresh vegetables and fruits, but when buying dried fruits, make sure that they don't contain added sulphur dioxide (SO2), which impedes the body's absorption of the B vitamins.</p> <p><strong>Consumer question of the month </strong></p> <p>Dear Jane, <br> Why doesn't my local branch of Pret A Manger serve decaffeinated coffee? </p> <p> Pret A Manger say some of their branches are now serving decaff.

If you can't face eating, it doesn't matter too much for the first 24 hours, as this will leave your digestive system free to fight the infection. </p> <p>2. Drink plenty of water (at least 2.5 litres) or herbal tea and avoid drinks that contain caffeine or milk, which aggravate an upset stomach. Sparkling water, or water infused with some fresh peeled root ginger, lemon grass or mint, can reduce nausea. Tap water can be as healthy as bottled water, but if you prefer bottled, don't keep an open bottle for more than 24 hours to avoid bacterial contamination. Avoid concentrated fruit juice, but you can safely dilute a little juice or squash with water. </p> <p>3. Steer clear of milk and milk products, which can increase the stomach's acidity level. </p> <p>4. High-fibre foods are hard for a distressed stomach to digest, so opt instead for white, lower-fibre carbohydrates, such as white rice, potatoes, pasta and white bread. </p> <p>5. If you feel in need of some protein, choose bland, rather than oily, fish, and chicken in preference to red meat. To avoid falling victim to such food pathogens as salmonella, hard-boil eggs and don't be tempted by raw meat or fish. </p> <p>6. Avoid raw vegetables (like salads) and fruits (especially citrus), which are difficult for an upset stomach to digest. </p> <p>7. Steer clear of digestion-challenging fatty foods, including butter, cream, olive oil, crisps and nuts. Your stomach will tolerate a plain biscuit, such as a digestive, matzo or rye cracker. </p> <p>8. Although fresh air can speed your recovery, try to rest until you feel better. </p> <p>9. When your appetite returns, give high-fat, spicy foods a wide berth, stick to light dishes, like a bowl of pasta tossed in a little olive oil or grated pecorino cheese, and eat slowly to encourage the production of digestive enzymes. It's better to eat small meals often than to overload your digestive system with widely spaced, heavy meals. </p> <p>10. When your nausea or diarrhoea has passed, consider taking 0a daily probiotic supplement containing acidophilus, bifida or lactobacillus (found in some live yoghurts and supplements sold by health food stores), which will maintain a healthy bacterial balance in your gut and fight off pathogenic bacteria.</p>",

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the manufacturers of supplements contend that it is, because supermarkets' lengthy storage times cause the levels of vitamin C, for example, in fresh produce to drop. I disagree: you can still glean your daily requirement of 60mg (about 30mg for children) of vitamin C if you eat some fresh or frozen produce every day. Smokers, however, need a whopping 2,000mg a day, so will probably need to take a supplement.)

If you do have a caffeinated drink that makes you feel awful, the Bodyfoods advice is either to drink a couple of tall glasses of water or some milk or herbal tea immediately, to sit still and to calm yourself by breathing deeply.

Somewhere behind the sommelier, beyond the vast windows of London's Belvedere restaurant, Holland Park was spread gaunt over a nasty March afternoon; grim and chill and leached bone-free of colour. All London's colour, all London's reds and yellows and golds, had that day distilled themselves into a glass resting before me, a glass being topped up by a beaming Marco Pierre White from a decanter which was increasingly failing to contain a bottle of Chateau d'Yquem 1970. A little over \u00a3750 a pop, as I later learnt while making a token effort to cover some of the bill (in much the same way as blanched spinach makes a token effort to stand up and stride out of the pan). We moved on - since you ask - to another d'Yquem (just an '86 this time) and managed a glorious four bottles of the Vega Sicilia 1990 along the way. A set lunch at the Belvedere costs \u00a314. By my estimation, our bill - Marco's bill- came to around \u00a32,500. Though I did let him bum a couple of cigarettes.</p> <p>So I may have misheard, but it seemed a suitable enough premise. Which Marco?</p> <p>There's the vintage Marco, 1987-1999. Bad-boy Marco, enfant terrible, the explosive Marco of leonine rage and silk-shark seduction. A mercurial bottle. Brilliant at its best but, frankly, a little unreliable. A number of chefs hated it, although the young ladies couldn't seem to get enough</p> <p>Or there's this new bottle, Marco Nouveau. Marco reformed, two years after hanging up his apron. A little more flesh to it. Married and faithful and coyly proud of fatherhood, no longer cooking daily but helping to run a \u00a350 million empire and determined to become the best restaurateur in the land. The Marco who says, now, 'I don't lose my temper any more,' and 'I leave my emotions at home,' and 'I've never been happier in my life.' Charming and trustworthy, all knives locked firmly in the cabinet. Perhaps one for your mother, if I may suggest? Although it can tend, at times, to taste a little twee.</p> <p>Or there's the full Marco. Forty this year. Complex. Still with the glints and barbs and flashes of old, but aged into something quite different. An altogether more subtle mix than generally suggested, and takes a little time to get to know, but it could reward you hugely in the end.</p> <p>Oh, I don't know. Would it be possible to try a little of all three?</p> <p>'Of course I was a shit in those days,' he says, lighting a fat Cubano and quietly ordering a fatter bottle of champagne for the sweetly giggly fortieth-birthday group of mothers at a far table, whom we will later attempt to charm with our best obscene jokes. 'I was terrible. I didn't like myself. No one could. But there were reasons for it all, I promise you, there were reasons.</p> <p>'Firstly, I wanted that first Michelin star so much.' And the the next, and the next: the first two gained at the legendary Harvey's in Wandsworth, scene of spitting battles with staff and customers, the other at the Hyde Park Hotel, making him the only British chef to win three stars (and the youngest in the world, ever). The stars rocket-boosted the burgeoning MPW empire, which now enfolds 14 of London's finest restaurants including the Criterion, Mirabelle, Titanic, the Grill Room, the Oak Room at Le Meridian and the Belvedere, and is about to expand throughout Britain in collaboration with his friend Rocco Forte, whom Marco says is now 'free from his father's shadow' and able, finally, to do something about building a reputation for good food.</p> <p>'The Michelin star was all I could think of. I loved cooking, obviously, but also I had something to prove. Or I thought, then, that I did. But, look, also, I was so unhappy in my twenties, desperately unhappy. There was an awful lot of stuff I hadn't dealt with.</p> <p>'So I became driven, totally driven, totally critical of myself, wanting every dish to be three-star, and that changes you, and changes the way you behave to people.' So yes, he shouted at his staff; yes, he screamed; 'but that happens in every restaurant. </p> <p>'Working that hard, in that heat, those hours. I was going for perfection. And perfection, it turns out, is simply a lot of little things done very well. So I shouted. And I got my stars.'</p> <p>What about rather famously shouting at customers, and throwing them out? 'There was always a reason. I was trying to create something special, and they were trying to spoil it. My pet hate, with customers, is those that think it's all about wallets. You get four silly boys, spoiling it for some guy with his wife at the next table, so you ask them to behave, and they take the attitude: bugger you, we've spent a lot of money. Well, bugger them. They're missing the point totally. Usually it's City boys, these expense-account types who know nothing about food. Yes, I threw 54 of them out one night. It was an engagement party, but they were far too rowdy they were dropping cigarette butts on the floor, for Christ's sake.'</p> <p>Which also, he says, accounted for the tale of the \u00a325 chips. 'Well, yes, that's true, a one-off. But this guy was just trying to show off in front of his City boys - there were no chips on the menu, but he asked for some. Fine. So I spent a long careful time on them - hand-cut, blanched, lovingly fried, served up with a little silver plate of sauce. An hour of my time. \u00a325. He hadn't thought to ask the price.'</p> <p>And throwing out food critics for wearing bicycle-clips? 'Well, yes, one. I mean, I expect a little courtesy. Generally I respect critics; they have their job to do.' He counts among his friends A.A. Gill and Michael Winner, the latter of whom was best man at his wedding last year to Mati (Matilde) Conejero, his third wife and mother to two of his three children, and who gave them their honeymoon at Venice's Cipriani. </p> <p>I ask, tangentially, what he makes not of critics but of TV chefs - for he was, after all, Britain's first real celebrity chef, as famous in the world of tabloids as the one of terrines. 'Well, live and let live. I'd hate it. And you'll soon lose the touch in a real restaurant kitchen. Look at Jamie [Oliver]; what's he going to remember about restaurant cooking after Sainsbury's? But let them have their time, they're doing no harm. Look at Ainsley Harriott. He's big, he's black as the ace of spades, and he's great fun, so what's wrong with that.' Is he a good chef then? A huge laugh. 'Fuck, no!'</p> <p>I also ask about the women. It's a slightly touchy area. 'Mati's a good Catholic girl, whom I adore, and have now very very happily married, so of course there were no women before her. I wasn't a womaniser.'</p> <p>Except he was. An industrial-strength womaniser. I'd done a straw poll of female colleagues who had met him, and of the two I found, he had only flirted with both of them, and only tried to bed one. Marco has the grace to laugh as I remind him of the latter, whom he phoned up simply because he liked the sound of her voice when she tried to book a table, many years ago at Harvey's, for herself and her then boyfriend. He was utterly charming, she recalls, and utterly persuasive in getting her out to lunch, and utterly good company, and utterly unashamed in suggesting, after coffee, that they repair to his flat.</p> <p>He laughs, but claims to have no memory of the event. Just as he claims to have completely forgotten the time when, after serving up a magnificent meal for a respected publisher and his gay partner, he kept insisting there must be something else he could do to make their meal complete, then had the brainwave of lifting out his manhood and slapping it onto the linen before them. He laughs, and doesn't confirm or deny. And he's uneasy about saying much more about those times, especially about the women, because of Mati; other than to repeat 'I was unhappy. My twenties were the worst period of my life.'</p> <p>Seldom more so than during his brief benighted marriage to model Lisa Butcher, who infuriated him on their wedding day by wearing a \u00a33,000 Bruce Oldfield dress which offered more to the camera than a husband had a right to expect to be offered that evening. 'Yes, it was sexy. But who was it sexy for?' The marriage lasted 15 weeks.</p> <p>And then there were the fallings-out. With Michael Caine, over their misadventure at the Canteen in Chelsea Harbour - although Caine will not now say a word against Marco, nor vice versa. With Damien Hirst, whose artworks were removed from Quo Vadis, the Soho restaurant they co-owned, and replaced with Marco's own Hirst pastiches, which guests reportedly prefer. 'I didn't fall out with Damien. I just issued a writ. He copied one of my paintings, called Rising Sun, and tried to pass it off as one of his own. I was very happy with the outcome. Damien was a friend. But I just didn't like what he tried to do.' With mentor Albert Roux, who had nicknamed him his 'little genius', and of whom Marco now says, sadly, 'He's lost it, a little. Albert was always chasing the money, always the money; he was everywhere but in the kitchen. But the food should come first, and the money will follow.' With rival (and former friend) Tony Allen, owner of the Fish! restaurant chain, who recently paid him an eye-popping set of damages for claiming Marco had once, as a joke, substituted real ink for squid ink in a dish of scallops and cuttlefish. And he's still not a person with whom you'd want to fall out. He tells me, with genuine anger, of one very well-known entrepreneur he and Mati recently entertained who failed to show any grace or courtesy to his wife and left without thanking her and exuded astonishing rudeness throughout. Marco asks that I keep his name off the record.</p> <p>Not that you can't simply argue with him. In fact, it's great fun. For all the changed-man stuff and the 'never been happier' stuff and 'perfect wife and children' stuff and 'I never go to parties now' stuff, he's still at his best when he's the real Marco: a couple of glasses down, sharp as a boning-knife and swearing with exuberance. So we argue about politics for a while. Says Marco: 'I'm a socialist in my heart and a capitalist in my head, which I suppose makes me, well'</p> <p>Well, a capitalist, actually, completely; the socialist stuff is bollocks, isn't it? I go on to demolish his arguments about Thatcherism by talking very quickly with lots of food in my mouth; he attempts to demolish my arguments about socialism by ordering us another of his \u00a3750 bottles of plonk. We move off politics, and onto the subject of Tony Blair. 'I just can't stand him,' says Marco, with real feeling. He turns to his PR. 'In fact, can you make sure the smarmy bastard's banned from my restaurants. Come to think of it, ban Hague too, absolutely no better - even more stupid and cynical. Tell you what though, Gordon Brown can come and have a meal. He's a proper man, and at least he seems to believe in something.'</p> <p><a href=\"http://x\">Read the second part of Euan Ferguson's interview here</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "'And which Marco would Sir like with his dessert?' I may, I confess, have been a little confused at the time. Somewhere behind the sommelier, beyond the vast windows of London's Belvedere restaurant, Holland Park was spread gaunt over a nasty March afternoon; grim and chill and leached bone-free of colour. All London's colour, all London's reds and yellows and golds, had that day distilled themselves into a glass resting before me, a glass being topped up by a beaming Marco Pierre White from a decanter which was increasingly failing to contain a bottle of Chateau d'Yquem 1970.

Would it be possible to try a little of all three?

      "body": "<p>I associate this restaurant with family for two reasons: the dishes are very authentic Punjab, which is where my family comes from in north west India, and because it is literally in the family - my brother-in-law, Jajesh Suri, manages it. Tamarind has successfully got away from the image of Indian restaurants as the sort of place that you stumble into, pissed, and have everything with lager. It is quite a dressy restaurant and sumptuously decorated, and there are always a lot of Indians eating here which is a good sign. </p> <p>Fancy restaurants like this are common all over India, especially in the big cities, but there are still very few in Britain. I often dress up and come with my family on special occasions and we've had quite a few charity events here. That is part of the pleasure of this restaurant; when we need a venue we always know that we can use it, but mainly I love it because it feels like eating at home. I grew up eating Punjab cuisine, and the Tamarind menu is filled with dishes that my mother cooks like Paneer Makhani and Pini Chana. Food is quite an emotional experience: when you're feeling homesick or a bit low, then what you want is to recreate the flavour that you associate with security, and I can have that here.</p> <p>Tamarind also has dishes that are European in style. Jalpari Chaat tandoori (prawn and scallops, with mint, and grapes) is a fusion of Mediterranean and Indian influences, and they have quite a few dishes that would straddle that. I've had that a few times, but I often end up having Paneer Machani, a Punjab Indian cheese dish. I'm not a purist, but sometimes only the pure stuff will do. Because I was brought up as mainly vegetarian I will always choose a vegetable over a fish dish. Punjab cuisine was mainly vegetarian, I didn't see a prawn until I was 18. The first time I had one I ate it with the feelers on and was very, very sick. I very occasionally eat chicken but I would never touch red meat. Food is an essential part of Indian family life. My home cooking is pure Punjab cooking and I'm teaching my daughter to cook the way I learnt from my mother - not because I feel that as she is a woman she has to learn to cook, but because it is a great emotional connection back to who we are.</p> <p>Indians take their food very seriously. People tend to lump Indian food together and there are so many types of cuisine within the country itself. For instance, rice-based dishes are more common in the south and breads are very important in northern Punjab cooking. The Tamarind has an open window at the back of the restaurant so you can see the chefs cooking all the different kinds of nan in the Tandoor oven, fresh in front of you. </p> <p>People usually associate curry with hotness, which is completely false, it is fairly spicy but in a layered way. At Tamarind and in many Indian homes the cooks might use up to eight or nine different spices and they have to put them in at certain times to get the best flavour from them. It is all about creating layers of flavour, and when you see somebody cook you realise why. Some high street restaurants will have pre-made sauces which they will use as the base for many of their dishes. That is okay food, but you can't compare pizza with going to the Ivy.</p> <p><strong>Tamarind tips</strong></p> <p><strong>Location</strong><br> Tamarind occupies the Mayfair site once occupied by the legendary Tiberio - an old rat-pack haunt of the Sixties, at 20 Queen Street, Mayfair, London W1X 7PJ.</p> <p><strong>Awards</strong><br> Michelin star in 2001/2002 Best Indian Chef in UK 1999 Best in Britain Award 2000 (Real Curry Guide)</p> <p><strong>Reviews</strong><br> 'Food to die for' <strong>New York Times</strong><br> 'The tandoori gear is seriously good...I was impressed' <strong>Andrew Lloyd Webber</strong><br> 'Expertise is evident...beautifully presented' <strong>Time Out </strong></p> <p><strong>Most popular dishes</strong><br> <strong>Starter:</strong> Shammi Kebab (ground lamb, coriander and mint) <br> <strong>Main Course:</strong> Hare Maslae Ki Machchi (pan-fried salmon with green spices and crispy spinach)<br> <strong>Dessert:</strong> Kulfi (Indian ice cream)</p> <p><strong>How much</strong><br> Set menus range from \u00a332.00 to \u00a345.00 per person.

The first time I had one I ate it with the feelers on and was very, very sick. I very occasionally eat chicken but I would never touch red meat. Food is an essential part of Indian family life. My home cooking is pure Punjab cooking and I'm teaching my daughter to cook the way I learnt from my mother - not because I feel that as she is a woman she has to learn to cook, but because it is a great emotional connection back to who we are. Indians take their food very seriously. People tend to lump Indian food together and there are so many types of cuisine within the country itself. For instance, rice-based dishes are more common in the south and breads are very important in northern Punjab cooking. The Tamarind has an open window at the back of the restaurant so you can see the chefs cooking all the different kinds of nan in the Tandoor oven, fresh in front of you. People usually associate curry with hotness, which is completely false, it is fairly spicy but in a layered way. At Tamarind and in many Indian homes the cooks might use up to eight or nine different spices and they have to put them in at certain times to get the best flavour from them. It is all about creating layers of flavour, and when you see somebody cook you realise why. Some high street restaurants will have pre-made sauces which they will use as the base for many of their dishes. That is okay food, but you can't compare pizza with going to the Ivy.

Replacing surgical instruments that might possibly carry the vCJD infection will add hugely to the bill.</p> <p>But worse - infinitely worse than all that - we began to share the grief of parents whose children fell victim to the hideous disease. And we began to worry for our own. Pictures of bright young teenagers began appearing in the newspapers and the text always told the same tragic story. Our beloved daughter had been full of life, full of fun, full of hope for the future. Then strange things started to happen. She could no longer concentrate. She grew irritable and angry. She became a different person. She lost control of her movements and her bodily functions. She became blind. She could no longer hear or speak. And then - with awful and absolute inevitability - she died.</p> <p>When I presented a special programme for Panorama on the BSE crisis Stephen Dorrell was desperate to assure me that the government had acted as soon as it 'had the evidence'. Who could quarrel with that? Well, the Livestock Standards Committee of the Soil Association had warned in 1983 that there were serious risks in feeding animal protein to ruminants and banned it for all organic farmers. They had no firm evidence, but every ounce of their intuition and common sense told them it was a stupid thing to do. They were ignored. The problem with waiting for the evidence is that by the time you get it, it may be too late.</p> <p>The politicians, advised by their experts, also wanted to reassure us that every step is now being taken to ensure that we will run no more similar risks. When a few questions were raised about the safety of beef on the bone, even from animals deemed to be entirely free from risk, butchers were immediately banned from selling it and T-bone steaks disappeared from restaurant menus. But still doubts remain in the minds of many people. The most persistent is this: BSE and other, lesser, food scares such as salmonella in eggs were the result of an approach to farming and food production that placed quantity above quality at every step in the chain and yet that approach has never been seriously questioned.</p> <p>If a chicken could be forced to grow faster to knock a few pence off the cost of producing it, we did it. And never mind that it lived in disgusting conditions that invited disease. If a cow could be forced to produce twice as much milk by feeding it ground-up meat and bonemeal, we did it. If a field of carrots could be forced to deliver a bigger yield by spraying the plants with pesticides and the weeds with herbicides, we did it. And never mind that the Department of Health had to warn the people who ate those carrots to peel them carefully and throw away the top inch because of pesticide residues.</p> <p>As so often before, many ordinary people with no great knowledge and no 'expert' advice to rely on were asking questions for themselves and reaching conclusions for themselves. One of those conclusions was that many of them wanted their food produced differently. They wanted less factory farming. They wanted food produced by less intensive methods. The supermarkets got the message. The revolution was born.</p> <p>We are endlessly told - usually by the supermarkets themselves - that we have the best food retailers in the world and we should be grateful for what they have done for us. Not everyone is persuaded. Some of us regret the disappearance of so many small butchers and bakers and greengrocers and chemists. Some of us mourn the destruction of so many high streets and town centres. When the supermarket chains tell us they are not to blame we do not believe them. We prefer the evidence of our own eyes and the application of our own common sense. But in at least one respect the supermarkets cannot be faulted. </p> <p>They are, by and large, run by brilliant marketing people who can spot a selling opportunity at a thousand paces and exploit it in less time than it takes to fill a trolley. It took them a very short time to recognise that their customers were scared at the thought of genetically modified food and they dumped it from their shelves before the biotech companies and the politicians knew what had hit them. Nothing sounds louder in the ear of a supermarket executive than a customer's threat to take her business to a competitor. Now the sound of customers demanding organic food was becoming deafening. All those supermarkets which had so recently scorned the idea of the so-called beard-and-sandal brigade were suddenly fighting each other for every organic carrot and tomato they could lay their hands on.</p> <p>Marks &amp; Spencer had once loftily declared that it would not be bothering with organic food because there was not enough demand and the quality could not be guaranteed. When they finally realised what was happening they changed their minds in a hurry. Sainsbury's and Waitrose were stocking close to a thousand lines by the middle of 2000 and Tesco was catching up fast. Asda launched its own brand of organic food. By the middle of the Nineties sales of organic food were growing at a rate of more than 40 per cent year on year. In 1999 we bought about \u00a3550 million worth of the stuff.</p> <p>At this point you might expect the men and women who run the organic movement in this country to be jumping up and down with delight and - for the large part - they are. But there are problems. One serious concern is how the supermarkets will behave in the next few years. So long as organic produce accounted for no more than a tiny niche market none of the big chains had been terribly interested. They sold the food at higher prices but paid the producers more for it, so their profits on the whole enterprise were relatively modest. They didn't worry too much about that. The main reason for stocking the stuff in the first place was to make sure that customers who wanted it did not go elsewhere. But now things are different. One in three of us buys organic food at some time or other. Tesco sold more than \u00a3150 million worth in 2000. Across the whole market it accounts for nearly five per cent of total spending. Organic food has become seriously big business and every supermarket chain wants more of it.</p> <p>The obvious way to take a bigger share of the market is to cut prices and then, maybe, push them back up again later when no one's looking. Tesco, for instance, said they would sell many of their organic products at the same price as conventional food. On the face of it, that sounds like good news; organic food has always commanded a pretty hefty premium which many people cannot afford. But the reason it costs more is that it is more expensive to produce. If the biggest supermarkets run true to form they will do what they have done: sooner or later they will put the squeeze on their organic suppliers to sell to them at the lowest possible price. The organic farmers and growers might then decide that the only way they can survive is to cut corners and lower their standards.</p> <p>All of this assumes that the extraordinary increase in the sales of organic food will continue. The projections suggest that it will. By 2002 it is estimated that it will have passed the billion-pound mark and, in the following five years, will have doubled again - at least.</p> <p>Yet there is another little worm gnawing away at the core of what seems to be an exceedingly healthy, growing apple. There were two big reasons for the sudden leap in demand for organic food: fear and distrust. We feared the diseases that could result from factory farming and we distrusted - with good reason - the reassurances that we were endlessly given. Many people also fear the consequences of eating food that contains the residues of dangerous pesticides. Those fears do not apply to organic food. Organic crops are not sprayed with synthetic poisons, so there are virtually no residues. It remains the case that of the 170,000 cows infected with BSE only a tiny number came from organic herds and they were animals that had been brought into the herd from other farms. Not one cow born and reared in a fully organic herd has ever gone down with BSE.</p> <p>Fear may be one reason for buying organic food. Moral objections to factory farming may be another. Concern for the environment may be another. Worries about the reckless use of antibiotics may be yet another. But there's something else too. Is organic food better for us? Surveys of public opinion and increasing sales in the supermarkets suggest that most people think it is. Hard scientific proof is less easy to come by.</p> <p>Critics of organic farming are not persuaded by any of this. The thoughtful sceptics say there is not enough evidence. They have a point; much more research needs to be done. </p> <p>But there is a powerful lobby opposed to organic farming who have no interest in evidence or research. That lobby includes vested interests: the agrochemical companies who sell the pesticides and the synthetic fertilisers; the biotech companies who want to sell their genetically modified seeds; the barley barons who have made small fortunes farming for subsidies; the politicians who are afraid to admit that they may have got it wrong over the years and are afraid to upset the big vested interests.</p> <p>We have had one agricultural revolution in living memory. It began in the 1950s and its effects - for good and ill - are with us still. It gave us bigger harvests. It also gave us environmental destruction and pesticide residues and antibiotic resistance and the horrors of mad cow disease. The more we have learnt about the food on our plate, the way it is grown and processed, the less we have come to trust it. Now we are being invited to embark on another revolution - genetic modification - with consequences we can only wonder at.</p> <p> With the benefit of two generations of experience it is easy to see why intensive agriculture went wrong. It was never more than a knee-jerk reaction to the fear of food shortages: produce it cheap and make sure there's lots of it. None of us paused to think about the long-term consequences of what we were doing. We must not make the same mistake again. We must think seriously about what we expect from food and the way it is produced. And our starting point should be that agriculture is, in effect, the nation's primary health service.</p> <p>So this is about more than the merits of one group of farmers over another and apportioning blame and praise. We should be moving on from that. We should be less arrogant and accept that good agriculture should not simply be battling against nature. If we allowed nature to have its way entirely most of us would starve, but it is possible to farm in harmony with it and not always in conflict. We should also acknowledge that good food is about more than calories and vitamins.</p> <p>You don't have to live in a yurt and wear rope sandals to accept all of that. It is possible both to accept the basic scientific principles of cause and effect and also to believe in the holistic view of the world as a living organism. What is impossible to believe in is the arrogant notion that we can do what we damned well like and to hell with the consequences. That's what we have been doing for the past half-century. It is time to stop. </p> <p><strong>'Kite's Nest Farm is an old-fashioned farm - well-run and beautiful'</strong></p> <p>Richard Young runs Kite's Nest Farm in Worcestershire. It lies on the northern escarpment of the Cotswold Hills, most of which are covered these days in regimented rows of cereals. In many respects Kite's Nest is a time warp. It is a mixed farm, as were most half a century ago before subsidies dictated farming methods.</p> <p>The cows have names rather than numbers. They live in families and suckle their young. The calves are never removed forcibly from their mothers. When her milk dries up the calf is weaned away naturally and when the new calf comes he moves aside. But he will stay with his mother. They graze in pastures filled with the sort of plants that would have been killed off long ago if they had been plastered with synthetic nitrogen. They are rich in herbs, which the cows select carefully. The farm is a botanist's dream. There are rare plants, including the yellow-flowered Dyer's greenweed, pyramid orchids and clustered bellflower and other species that have long since vanished from most of Britain. You do not see all this on a modern efficient farm.</p> <p>But who is to say that this is not efficient? The cows live longer and are healthier because they are under no stress. When you approach them they do not back away as they have been treated with care and affection all their lives. But they must earn their keep and when their youngsters reach the right age they are slaughtered locally. The Youngs sell the meat in the farm shop where it fetches a premium price and there is no shortage of buyers. When other farmers were forced to slaughter their precious livestock and watch their life's work being destroyed by BSE, the Youngs had no fears. Richard's mother had stopped buying compound feed in 1974 when she discovered that it contained chicken carcasses. The Youngs have never had a case of BSE.</p> <p>So this is a thoroughly old fashioned farm. It survives because its costs are low and it caters to a specific market. On a spring day there is a real sense of nature in harmony with itself. The blind worshippers will say that this is romantic twaddle. There is, they will say, no such thing as 'nature', that nature is to be controlled, managed, manipulated. If we relied on farms like this we would all starve. It follows, therefore, that Richard Young is a crank. Well, let me invite you to spend an hour in his office.</p> <p>It is a big office, the first floor of an old barn. Computer screens glow, fax machines stutter out reams of paper and the filing cabinets which line every wall bulge with thousands of documents. Few of them have anything to do with the farm. Most are scientific papers, the sort that have been published by clever men and women with enough degrees to paper their walls. They are concerned with the world of microbiology and, more specifically, the effect on bacteria of antibiotics .Young may not have an academic letter to his name but he spotted the devastating assault being made on the front line of our medical defences long before many of the people who wrote these papers.</p> <p>For 15 years he has been assembling a powerful argument and trying to get people to listen. He is not qualified to stare into a microscope and write up the results, but ge does opossess an inquiring mind, an ability to absorb, understand and analyse information, a capacity for hard work and a lifetime of studying the way animals respond when they are treated in certain ways. But he is not a scientist. I leave you to judge whether his concerns over antibiotic resistance were well founded or whether he is just a crank. </p> <p>\u00a9 2001 by John Humphrys.</p> <p>\u0095 The Great Food Gamble is published by Hodder and Stoughton at \u00a312.99.</p>",

The Youngs sell the meat in the farm shop where it fetches a premium price and there is no shortage of buyers. When other farmers were forced to slaughter their precious livestock and watch their life's work being destroyed by BSE, the Youngs had no fears. Richard's mother had stopped buying compound feed in 1974 when she discovered that it contained chicken carcasses. The Youngs have never had a case of BSE. So this is a thoroughly old fashioned farm. It survives because its costs are low and it caters to a specific market. On a spring day there is a real sense of nature in harmony with itself. The blind worshippers will say that this is romantic twaddle. There is, they will say, no such thing as 'nature', that nature is to be controlled, managed, manipulated. If we relied on farms like this we would all starve. It follows, therefore, that Richard Young is a crank. Well, let me invite you to spend an hour in his office. It is a big office, the first floor of an old barn. Computer screens glow, fax machines stutter out reams of paper and the filing cabinets which line every wall bulge with thousands of documents. Few of them have anything to do with the farm. Most are scientific papers, the sort that have been published by clever men and women with enough degrees to paper their walls. They are concerned with the world of microbiology and, more specifically, the effect on bacteria of antibiotics .Young may not have an academic letter to his name but he spotted the devastating assault being made on the front line of our medical defences long before many of the people who wrote these papers. For 15 years he has been assembling a powerful argument and trying to get people to listen. He is not qualified to stare into a microscope and write up the results, but ge does opossess an inquiring mind, an ability to absorb, understand and analyse information, a capacity for hard work and a lifetime of studying the way animals respond when they are treated in certain ways. But he is not a scientist. I leave you to judge whether his concerns over antibiotic resistance were well founded or whether he is just a crank. \u00a9 2001 by John Humphrys. \u0095 The Great Food Gamble is published by Hodder and Stoughton at \u00a312.99.",

      "body": "<p>In this extract from his compelling new book John Humphrys reveals how Britain's eating habits have been transformed by our mistrust of intensive farming and why a safe supper doesn't have to cost more than the one that might kill you.</p> <p>In the early Nineties when the full horror of BSE was becoming apparent many people were beginning to ask serious questions about the food on our tables and to worry about food in a way we had not done in our recent history. I thought then that we needed a proper national debate which addressed the most fundamental questions. Sadly, it took another great farming crisis to bring that debate about and it is unfolding now.</p> <p>That crisis is, of course, the foot and mouth epidemic. The question on which it has focused attention - and which should have been addressed a long time ago - goes to the heart of Britain's food policy since the Second World War. Has the relentless drive for more and more cheap food proved to be a mistake?</p> <p>The most powerful voices in the food industry scoff at even a hint of doubt. They tell us it is naive to raise the question. They remind us that choice is more varied and shopping for food has never been more convenient. Above all, they say, food is cheaper than it has ever been. The only alternative to the way we have been farming, producing and distributing our food for half a century is to return to some primitive form of agriculture and food production that would lead to desperate shortages, sky-high prices and disease-ridden animals. We would be back in the Middle Ages. Some talk darkly of malnourished children, even the return of diseases such as rickets.</p> <p>Most of that is hysterical, self-serving nonsense. Malnutrition is a function of poverty or ignorance or both, not of the availability of food. I have spoken to doctors who worry about some of their young patients because they are fed a diet of junk food. Their parents have never cooked them a meal of fresh meat and vegetables in their short lives. That has nothing to do with the price of food. On the contrary, processed food is invariably more expensive than fresh vegetables. It is, to use the jargon of the day, a 'lifestyle' choice and one that is encouraged by the industry. Quite simply, there is more profit in a bag of crisps than in a pound of potatoes.</p> <p>Nor is a return to 'primitive' farming practices the only alternative to factory farming and highly intensive agriculture. That is a gross insult to all those farmers who care deeply for the welfare of their animals and do not regard them as mere units of production. It also ignores the advances made in less intensive farming technologies. A growing number of farmers are finding ways of achieving good yields without tearing open yet another drum of chemicals or bag of synthetic fertiliser.</p> <p>But the big question the industry and most politicians have been so reluctant to address is whether 'cheap' food is really cheap. To do so is to raise doubts about their judgment or even their motives. What price, for instance, should society put on the destruction of so much of our rural heritage, the loss of our water meadows and ancient hedges, the disappearance of so many songbirds?</p> <p>It may be impossible to calculate that sort of thing in hard cash, but much else can be quantified. There are the taxes we pay to finance farming subsidies. There is the cost of cleaning chemical pollution from our drinking water. There are the consequences for the National Health Service of factory farmers abusing antibiotics. There is the possible impact on our health of chemical residues in our food.</p> <p>There are the long-term effects of soil erosion and declining soil fertility. There is the terrible impact and vast cost of a tragedy such as BSE. And now, as I write, we are in the midst of another epidemic, foot and mouth disease. It would not be fair to say it is the direct result of intensive agriculture. But modern practices of food production and supply have enabled it to spread at a terrifying speed across the entire country.</p> <p>Is it naive to raise questions about a food policy that has created such a legacy? I think not. But this is not a counsel of despair. There are many farmers and food producers and even politicians who accept that mistakes have been made and are searching for better ways of doing things. I believe the British people will insist on it. We are no longer prepared to take our food for granted. The nation wants a serious debate and there is no way of stopping it. </p> <p>When the Chinese leader, Chou En-lai (1898-1976), was asked for his assessment of the effect of the French Revolution he paused for a moment and then said: 'It's too early to tell.' He may have been a shade too cautious, but you can see his point; history takes a long time to settle down. We think a particular action will have a particular consequence and years later, for a hundred reasons we had not even considered at the time, we discover we were wrong. There was a revolution in agriculture after the war - the birth of factory farming and industrial agriculture - and we are still assessing its effects because they continue to this day. But there has also been a counter-revolution of sorts in the past 15 years in the food industry. It is going to take a very long time before we can be sure of its effects because it, too, is still in progress. It is the organic revolution.</p> <p>In 1981 it was just about possible to buy organic food in a Safeway supermarket - assuming you knew there was such a thing and assuming you wanted it very badly indeed. Four years later if you looked hard enough in one or two Sainsbury's or Waitrose stores you might find a few bruised apples or limp carrots with bits of soil still clinging to them on sale at silly prices. You wondered why the supermarket bothered and you wondered who would dream of buying the stuff.</p> <p>Most supermarket managers looked on with a mixture of amusement and contempt. They said the days of muck and mystery had disappeared a long time ago and shoppers wanted their fruit and vegetables to be pristine, uniform and cheap. They did not want their apples to have blemishes on their skin; they had to be clean and shiny. Some supermarket bosses said sniffily that the quality of organic food could not be guaranteed. But 10 years later all the supermarkets were taking a serious interest. Within another five years they were fighting each other for a share of a market that was growing faster than any other sector in the industry. So what had happened to change things so dramatically? </p> <p>It's easy enough to say what did not happen. There was no encouragement from our political leaders. They either did not know what was beginning to happen or they did not care. There was no great marketing drive by the big retailers. Any marketing expert will tell you that it's not difficult to persuade us to buy things if the budget is big enough. Not until many years later did the retailers start using organic food in their advertisements to tempt fickle shoppers. In terms of marketing, this was the quiet revolution.</p> <p>As even Chou En-lai would concede, revolutions can succeed only if they have the support of a significant section of the population. They do not receive that support unless the people are unhappy with the status quo. So it was with food. There were enough people becoming a little uneasy about the quality and safety of the food they were buying from the supermarkets to spot that something was starting to happen. The reasons for the unease were mixed. Some people were worried about the use of pesticides. Some were offended by the worst excesses of factory farming and the effects it was having on the animals who suffered under it. Some were nervous about the growing number of food scares. And when those people saw organic food being offered in the supermarkets they winced at the higher cost but took a few apples or carrots home with them. </p> <p>But they were still relatively few. Organic food had yet to break out of its niche market. It was growing, but it was still only for the more eccentric customers. It was hardly a subject that dominated the board meetings at Tesco or Sainsbury's. And then, one March afternoon in 1996, the Secretary of State for Health, Stephen Dorrell, stood up in the House of Commons to make a statement which would shatter the nation's confidence in our food. This was to prove the turning point. The quiet revolution was about to explode.</p> <p>Four months earlier Mr Dorrell had been asked on television whether there was any connection between BSE and a new variant of an old disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease or CJD. He had said no there was no conceivable risk from eating British beef. Almost five years later Mr Dorrell was to tell me on the Today programme that he regretted ever having given that interview because he'd got it wrong. The message he delivered on that spring afternoon was a very different one indeed.</p> <p>He told a packed and worried House that the 'most likely explanation' for the cases of CJD was indeed a link to BSE. MPs had been expecting bad news, but this was devastating. The implication was immediately obvious to everyone who heard him. Not only was mad cow disease wreaking havoc in the nation's dairy herds; there was a human equivalent of the disease and it was even more terrible. Every time we had eaten British beef in the past 10 years or more we had been putting our health at risk. There was no cure for the disease and it was always fatal. CJD could lie dormant in our unsuspecting bodies for a very long time. It might take 10, 15, 20 years or even longer to make its malignant presence felt. No one could predict how many people were already infected. It might be a handful. It might be a million.</p> <p>Even now, all these years later, it is hard to forget the impact of that statement. Many of us remembered with a shudder the steaks we had grilled or the Sunday joints we had enjoyed. Far worse, we looked at our children and thought of the mincemeat we had made into sauces for their spaghetti or the hamburgers we had treated them to on a Saturday afternoon shopping expedition. Could we really have been poisoning our own children, condemning them to die from some hideous disease that we had never even known existed? It was scarcely credible.</p> <p>The initial reaction was anger. We cursed the farmers who had forced their cows to behave like cannibals, then we cursed the arrogance and greed of the feed manufacturers and the renderers who had turned nature on its head by producing the wretched feed and not even telling the farmers what was in it unless they asked. Then we cursed the politicians and their civil servants who had been either uncaring or incompetent or secretive or all three.</p> <p>It was at that point that many people decided they could no longer trust the food they were buying. Connections were made between cost and quality. There was one reason and one reason only for feeding ruminants on the ground-up brains and spines and bones of other animals. It was profit. The left-over bits of slaughtered animals cost the manufacturers relatively little and contained lots of protein. A cow fed on only her natural diet of grass and cereals produced nothing like as much milk as one fed on the concentrated food made from the left-overs of an abattoir. The manufacturers made more money and the farmers sold more milk and the price of food kept falling.</p> <p>\u00a9 2001 by John Humphrys.</p> <p><a href=\"http://x\">Read the second part of John Humphrys' article here</a></p>",

Well, I said, I don't really know. I mean, I think the fucker's still dead, isn't he?'</p> <p>And genuine fun, too, on food, about which he could probably talk forever. Memories of his childhood, growing up on a council estate in Leeds, and the crab sandwiches in Whitley, and the proper, whorled, purple meat you could buy and bone, and the eight types of bacon in the butcher's in Bridlington, and his first real meal out, with a date, to Oliver's in Harrogate, in 1980. 'Dublin Bay prawns, as they were called then, and Beef Wellington in madeira sauce. It was \u00a369, which was a lot of money then. It was fantastic.' And the nonsense talked about food in Britain over the past 20 years. 'Cuisine nouvelle was just a concept, and one which, crucially, the English managed to get wrong. I mean, if you run a restaurant, you've got to feed people, not make pretty little pictures on plates to make up for your lack of ability.' </p> <p>What, I wonder, would his own favourite meal be, if he'd just come from a year on a desert island? 'Easy: I'd have roast chicken. To start, a delicious bowl of soup; actually, a bowl of butter-bean broth that Mati's mother makes. You peel off the fat of belly-pork and spread it on toast, like butter. It's delicious, and fairly bad for you. Then roast chicken with bread sauce, chipolatas, bacon. And a crumble to finish. Heaven.'</p> <p>And the diet-fad bollocks and the over-fancy presentation bollocks. He remembers being asked by a reader of his Sunday Mirror cooking column how to make low-fat pastry (pastry is, he says incidentally, the hardest thing for a chef to make; 'you've actually got to know a good bit about chemistry to get it truly right'). His reply, which was printed, still sends him into mild paroxysms of delight: 'First, make normal pastry. Then, roll it out really thin'</p> <p>'I mean, it's not all that hard, none of it. Attention to detail. Good ingredients. Simply cooked. I'm a classicist. Something being simple should never stop it being really good.</p> <p>'I massively object, for instance, to your Caf\u00e9 Rouge and Caf\u00e9 Flo and Chez Gerard. I mean, they're appalling. It honestly isn't that hard to serve good food at affordable prices. But they're an insult to all of us - because they're run by accountants, not restaurateurs. In fact, that's the third bit of the recipe. Good ingredients, cooked simply - and kept as far away as humanly possible from the fucking accountants.'</p> <p>And, on cue, his waiters arrive to allow him to illustrate his point. One with water, and a shimmer of glasses; one with bread in all its baskets; one with new ashtrays; and he waves them away quietly, and with a certain courtesy. 'Just pour the water. We don't want bread. Ashtray's fine. Please leave space on the table. For us to talk, and smoke, and drink. Many thanks.' They melt away obligingly: paid enough, tipped enough, respected enough; sanguine with all the wants of the customer if these are expressed with sufficient grace.</p> <p>And I remember those dour nights in Caf\u00e9 Whatever, the \u00a374.50 bill clacking out insultingly loudly at 11.10pm for something you can't remember on a tiny round table for two crammed with seven glasses and a welter of plastic butter pats and an awkward Franglais menu in a holder designed to be knocked ever sideways across your stupidly vast bowl of chips by the hassled sleeve of the underpaid waitress, and 'Femmes' et 'Hommes' with their niggling job-lot corporate taps and deeply unFrench Cif, and finally getting up to fetch your own ashtray from beside the payphone after asking only nine times; and I get, wholly, his point.</p> <p>It's simply about control. Control, and respect. From the customer. From the restaurateur, the waiter, the chef. This, Marco says, is a contract. One of us is paying hard, one of us is working hard; so let's respect each other, and let's each enjoy it as much as possible: which is, when it works, rather a lot.</p> <p>'Control, and respect.'</p> <p>Marco shrugs as he says the words. It is a week earlier, and we are fishing, down on a private stretch of the River Test by Southampton, with his youngest son, also Marco, 5, nearby. He is talking about restaurants. He might as easily be talking about his fishing. He might as easily be talking about his anything, for control is a huge part of Marco's life. I see it in the tiniest things. In the way he took control of the huge cooked breakfast an hour earlier, insisting we try the black pudding, ladling out baked beans with a care normally reserved for caviar. I see it, later in the restaurant, when he creases his napkin just-so, sideways, in two, and places it on the edge of the table, under his plate, to catch crumbs and keep the table-linen clean, and simply makes sure he doesn't drop anything on his clothes. Which he wears with control: the hat, from Lock's of St James (naturally), placed with slow attention on his shaggy mane before he walks to ask the birthdaying ladies if they've enjoyed their meal (and, incidentally, had they heard the one about). </p> <p>Control of design: of the little fish-shaped ashtrays in the Mirabelle, and the huge coral and the Venetian glass bowls he found on the Fulham Road for the Belvedere, and how they'll blend exactly with the chinoiserie he's planning to bring in ('He sees it all before it happens,' says Mati. 'I can't see it at all. But he just gets it somehow right'). Control over the smallest things. 'See,' he whispers as our food arrives - 'we lay it down with both hands, hands under the plate, so you get no thumbprints on the top.' Even during his honeymoon, he explains, he was thinking of the little things: being taken round the kitchens of famous Harry's Bar he noticed the peach-juice sachets defrosting in the sink and made a note of the local supplier: these are now flown in to London to make his Bellinis. Whether boning a side of venison or threading hooks through bait, his every action is soft, secure, measured.</p> <p>We watch him fish. He has set up four lines. He has watched them for six hours. Not a twitch, not a judder, not a flick. Not from the water, nor from Marco. Quietly, resolutely, fascinatingly, his stubble grew on. The fish, it turned out, were spawning.</p> <p>The only movement came when we would wander half-hourly, silently, the ten yards back to the Merc for yet another cigarette. There was more dynamism from the water beetles, and the occasional splash from fish with much else on their minds. The highlight of the day, in terms of action, had come when Marco junior, now five, fell into a wash of nettles and tried, bravely but in vain, not to cry. We chased dock leaves. Marco senior cooed over his youngest - 'Marrrrrcoo!', with the warmest Italian burr, or even 'darrrling!' - but he cooed quietly, not to disturb the shagging fish. We caught nothing, all day. But Marco was elated: he knew it was because the fish were spawning that day, and he'd never seen them spawning before.</p> <p>'So I've learnt something else. We should never stop learning, ever.' Okay, I concede over another cigarette, as young Marco, his knees lovingly cleaned and patched, pores over his GameBoy in the front of the car, strangely bored with the uncatchable shagging nonexistent fish. What should the customer learn? What are Marco's lessons to the customer?</p> <p>'The majority of customers are smart, nice, well-behaved, knowledgeable. There's only a few who want to take advantage of the situation. So. If you don't like your table, say so. If you want your steak well done, just say so. Tell them things. Tell them what's wrong with the table, or that it's your wife's birthday. As long as you do it with courtesy, and respect, the restaurant should respect you back. Things do go wrong, of course they go wrong. And we can try but we can't cover everything; it's sometimes up to the customer to point things out. Far better that than they have their night spoilt and go away moaning. The only thing that truly annoys me is people turning up very late or very early that's a different thing. Spare a thought: I mean, we've got something like 200 meals being prepared that night, all to be served just-so; timing gets a bit crucial. Do I complain in restaurants? Well, actually, no, not now. I just don't go back.</p> <p>'I like all sets of customers, though they're all different. The Jews, for instance, always ask for the same table. Never mind if there's only two when they were six last week, they still want the same table. The Japs want the bill instantly, soon as they nod for it. The Americans well, they're just children, aren't they! The best, in a way, are the Arabs. They love to feel attended to, and they're polite in themselves, and they reward good service; there are boys in my restaurants who have lifted \u00a31,000 tips at the end of a night.</p> <p>'But, wait, that gives the wrong impression the thing about my restaurants is that they're mean to be about affordable luxury. That's the future of dining. Everyone should be able to go. All I'm trying to do is give people something special, appeal to that side of them that loves good things. I've got them myself now. I didn't set out to; I only started making good money a few years ago. Until 34 I was pretty broke, I used to put everything back into the business; the food was always the thing. </p> <p>'But now, I don't have to prove anything any more. I can give something back. You should never forget where you've come from, and if you've been lucky you should give some back.' A rudely plopping fish interrupts his reverie just before he anoints himself with Papal infallibility.</p> <p>He handed back his Michelin stars when he stopped cooking. He does work in his kitchens now, but only intermittently, popping in unannounced to check consistency or teach new recruits; his greatest skill, he says, his favourite, is boning. Did it hurt, giving the stars back?</p> <p>'Achieving three stars is exciting. Maintaining three stars is pretty boring. The menu doesn't change, for instance. But the fear is still there, because to lose a star would just be just devastating. So it didn't really hurt, not in the end. Also, Michelin are changing. They lost their old inspector in Britain, a marvellous man, and some of their judgments these days well, Michelin like the frills as much as the food, and I think that's missing the point . A lot more restaurants in this town should in my opinion have at least one Michelin star. And yet they'd given one to the Oriental at the Dorchester - actually it lost it this year - when there's far better Oriental food, really well sourced, at some little places in Chinatown. They've now devalued their entire currency. Part of the reason I gave my three stars back was that they didn't mean that much any more. I won Chef of the Decade five years ago: voted by 1,800 chefs, all starred, and that was worth it, that meant something. But a lot of the Michelin and Egon Ronay stuff is bollocks, it's just PR for them.'</p> <p>And little Marco is back with us, tugging at sleeves. His father coos his name, and he answers back, grinning, 'It's not Marco. It's Mark.' His father smiles; it's a conversation they've had before, as he had himself with his own parents. I look down at little Marco, and ask him, 'Okay, if you're just Mark, then what's Daddy's name? He beams back, proudly.</p> <p>'That's easy. Marco Pierre White.'</p> <p>Graham, Clive, Marco Pierre, Craig. Four sons of an alcoholic chef called Frank White and an Italian beauty called Maria Rosa, growing up on a Leeds council estate. Maria had been allowed to name just one of the boys. Guess which one.</p> <p>He hated the name at the time, he says, but knows it's done him good. We are in his car, post-Belvedere, replete, being driven to the Mirabelle, and we are finally getting to the nub of things, to the 'stuff' he mentioned earlier, the stuff he hadn't dealt with. His driver and aide-de-camp, Mr Ishi, fiddles with the stereo to put on Marco's favourite CD and the music wafts in fittingly with the Yquem fumes and the confessions. It is 'The Immigrant' by Nino Rota. Better known, perhaps, as the theme music to The Godfather.</p> <p>He lost his mother when he was six. She was 38 (the same age as Marco when he stopped cooking). 'And I spent the next three decades confused. I thought I was my father's son alone, and did everything to try to impress him, and nothing was ever enough. He just wanted the best, I suppose, but he had a hard Yorkshire way of showing it. As a child, I just took it as rejection, of course. And an awful lot of my motivation - all those early years, my twenties, this reputation I've got - came about because I was trying to prove myself to him, to prove a point.' He stops talking for a little. Earlier, he had made one allusion to those times, while we were discussing whisky, recalling, very quietly, 'It was after whisky my father would beat us, just after the whisky'.</p> <p>In the end, it was too late: his father was dying of cancer when Marco won his first star, and couldn't really take in the news. And Marco was, finally, changing anyway, coming out of his shadow. 'Towards the end, I remember saying to him, \"Now I no longer fear you I can enjoy your company\".</p> <p>'And then, I began to realise things. I started, at 31, to want to know who my mother was, for instance.' He dug out relatives, he travelled to Italy, he asked questions. 'And I found out enough to realise some things. She was so young, so tragic - but she was also a fantastic cook, with a love of art. She sounded wonderful. And I suddenly realised something, something huge. I am my mother's son, not my father's. That is what I'd been getting wrong all those years. And that's what changed me, calmed me. It was like seeing a light. It's not just coming out of the kitchen, or growing older, or fatherhood well, it's all of them, but that was the big, big change. That's what you have to understand if you want to know who the real Marco is now.'</p> <p>The music has begun swelling towards its thematic, tearful climax. 'Had my father been Italian and my mother English it wouldn't have been the same. It's like being a Jew.' The strings are two seconds from bursting in. Marco pauses, for half a beat, thinking deeply. 'It's as they say: you only have one mother in life; you can have a thousand fathers.' And in the music sweeps: music of death, and loss, and love, and food, and Italy, and ambition, and control, and rebirth. Thank you, Marco. You couldn't have timed it better yourself.</p> <p><strong>Marco: a life in words</strong></p> <p>'I have learnt three things in my life. I have learnt that self-control is true power. I have learnt that a clear conscience is true strength. And that good friends and family are true wealth'</p> <p>'I believe in taking advantage of other people's misfortunes'</p> <p>'I never make the first move but if someone even hurts me a little, I will descend on them'</p> <p> 'I didn't want to be a chef, I simply wanted the freedom and a good time'</p> <p>'It was ten months before I threw out my first customer. But I was like a serial killer. Once I'd got the taste for it, I couldn't stop'</p> <p><strong>Marco's calf's liver and bacon</strong></p> <p>Calf's liver is fine and delicate in flavour, and much used in Italian cooking (particularly Fegato alla veneziana). Here is a more traditionally English way of serving it. Serves 4</p> <p><strong>vegetable oil</strong><br><strong> 12 sage leaves</strong><br><strong> salt and freshly ground white pepper</strong><br><strong> 4 small lettuces, Cos or Baby Gem</strong><br><strong> carrot, celeriac, onion and celery stalk, peeled and finely diced</strong><br><strong> 25g unsalted butter</strong><br><strong> 250ml veal stock </strong><br><strong> 8 very thin slices streaky bacon</strong><br><strong> plain flour</strong><br><strong> 4 x 150g thin slices calf's liver</strong><br><strong> 4 portions pomme pur\u00e9e</strong></p> <p>1. Deep-fry the sage leaves in hot vegetable oil, then drain well on kitchen paper. Season with a little salt.</p> <p>2. Make the braised lettuce: halve the lettuces and blanch them quickly in boiling salted water, then refresh in cold water and drain well. Sweat the vegetable dice in the butter until they colour. Place the lettuce and diced vegetables in a pot and add the stock and some seasoning. Bring to the boil, cover, and braise for 10 to 15 minutes until tender.</p> <p>3. Lightly grill the bacon without colouring.</p> <p>4. Season and flour the liver, dusting off any excess. Pan-fry in 100ml hot oil until pink, a minute or so on each side depending on the thickness.</p> <p>5. To serve, place the liver on a heap of braised lettuce, with two slices of bacon on top , and decorate with the sage. Serve with pomme pur\u00e9e.</p> <p>\u0095 This recipe was taken from The Mirabelle Cookbook, Ebury Press.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Then we move on to class, and the types of people he occasionally stalks and fishes with. 'I like them, why not? I just like people. Mind you, some of your nobs can be truly thick, can't they? I was with one recently, very nice guy, but we started talking about Di and Dodi and Al-Fayed and that mob, and he suddenly asks, \"Yeees and what's old Dodi up to these days anyway?\" I thought I'd misheard, so got him to ask again; same thing, what's old Dodi knocking about at. Well, I said, I don't really know. I mean, I think the fucker's still dead, isn't he?' And genuine fun, too, on food, about which he could probably talk forever. Memories of his childhood, growing up on a council estate in Leeds, and the crab sandwiches in Whitley, and the proper, whorled, purple meat you could buy and bone, and the eight types of bacon in the butcher's in Bridlington, and his first real meal out, with a date, to Oliver's in Harrogate, in 1980. 'Dublin Bay prawns, as they were called then, and Beef Wellington in madeira sauce. It was \u00a369, which was a lot of money then. It was fantastic.' And the nonsense talked about food in Britain over the past 20 years. 'Cuisine nouvelle was just a concept, and one which, crucially, the English managed to get wrong. I mean, if you run a restaurant, you've got to feed people, not make pretty little pictures on plates to make up for your lack of ability.' What, I wonder, would his own favourite meal be, if he'd just come from a year on a desert island? 'Easy: I'd have roast chicken. To start, a delicious bowl of soup; actually, a bowl of butter-bean broth that Mati's mother makes. You peel off the fat of belly-pork and spread it on toast, like butter. It's delicious, and fairly bad for you. Then roast chicken with bread sauce, chipolatas, bacon. And a crumble to finish. Heaven.' And the diet-fad bollocks and the over-fancy presentation bollocks. He remembers being asked by a reader of his Sunday Mirror cooking column how to make low-fat pastry (pastry is, he says incidentally, the hardest thing for a chef to make; 'you've actually got to know a good bit about chemistry to get it truly right'). His reply, which was printed, still sends him into mild paroxysms of delight: 'First, make normal pastry. Then, roll it out really thin' 'I mean, it's not all that hard, none of it. Attention to detail. Good ingredients. Simply cooked. I'm a classicist. Something being simple should never stop it being really good. 'I massively object, for instance, to your Caf\u00e9 Rouge and Caf\u00e9 Flo and Chez Gerard. I mean, they're appalling. It honestly isn't that hard to serve good food at affordable prices. But they're an insult to all of us - because they're run by accountants, not restaurateurs. In fact, that's the third bit of the recipe. Good ingredients, cooked simply - and kept as far away as humanly possible from the fucking accountants.' And, on cue, his waiters arrive to allow him to illustrate his point. One with water, and a shimmer of glasses; one with bread in all its baskets; one with new ashtrays; and he waves them away quietly, and with a certain courtesy. 'Just pour the water. We don't want bread. Ashtray's fine. Please leave space on the table. For us to talk, and smoke, and drink. Many thanks.' They melt away obligingly: paid enough, tipped enough, respected enough; sanguine with all the wants of the customer if these are expressed with sufficient grace. And I remember those dour nights in Caf\u00e9 Whatever, the \u00a374.50 bill clacking out insultingly loudly at 11.10pm for something you can't remember on a tiny round table for two crammed with seven glasses and a welter of plastic butter pats and an awkward Franglais menu in a holder designed to be knocked ever sideways across your stupidly vast bowl of chips by the hassled sleeve of the underpaid waitress, and 'Femmes' et 'Hommes' with their niggling job-lot corporate taps and deeply unFrench Cif, and finally getting up to fetch your own ashtray from beside the payphone after asking only nine times; and I get, wholly, his point. It's simply about control. Control, and respect. From the customer. From the restaurateur, the waiter, the chef. This, Marco says, is a contract. One of us is paying hard, one of us is working hard; so let's respect each other, and let's each enjoy it as much as possible: which is, when it works, rather a lot. 'Control, and respect.' Marco shrugs as he says the words. It is a week earlier, and we are fishing, down on a private stretch of the River Test by Southampton, with his youngest son, also Marco, 5, nearby. He is talking about restaurants. He might as easily be talking about his fishing. He might as easily be talking about his anything, for control is a huge part of Marco's life.

Control of design: of the little fish-shaped ashtrays in the Mirabelle, and the huge coral and the Venetian glass bowls he found on the Fulham Road for the Belvedere, and how they'll blend exactly with the chinoiserie he's planning to bring in ('He sees it all before it happens,' says Mati.

Whether boning a side of venison or threading hooks through bait, his every action is soft, secure, measured. We watch him fish. He has set up four lines. He has watched them for six hours. Not a twitch, not a judder, not a flick. Not from the water, nor from Marco. Quietly, resolutely, fascinatingly, his stubble grew on. The fish, it turned out, were spawning. The only movement came when we would wander half-hourly, silently, the ten yards back to the Merc for yet another cigarette. There was more dynamism from the water beetles, and the occasional splash from fish with much else on their minds. The highlight of the day, in terms of action, had come when Marco junior, now five, fell into a wash of nettles and tried, bravely but in vain, not to cry. We chased dock leaves. Marco senior cooed over his youngest - 'Marrrrrcoo!', with the warmest Italian burr, or even 'darrrling!' - but he cooed quietly, not to disturb the shagging fish. We caught nothing, all day. But Marco was elated: he knew it was because the fish were spawning that day, and he'd never seen them spawning before. 'So I've learnt something else. We should never stop learning, ever.' Okay, I concede over another cigarette, as young Marco, his knees lovingly cleaned and patched, pores over his GameBoy in the front of the car, strangely bored with the uncatchable shagging nonexistent fish. What should the customer learn? What are Marco's lessons to the customer? 'The majority of customers are smart, nice, well-behaved, knowledgeable. There's only a few who want to take advantage of the situation. So. If you don't like your table, say so. If you want your steak well done, just say so. Tell them things. Tell them what's wrong with the table, or that it's your wife's birthday. As long as you do it with courtesy, and respect, the restaurant should respect you back. Things do go wrong, of course they go wrong. And we can try but we can't cover everything; it's sometimes up to the customer to point things out.

Here is a more traditionally English way of serving it. Serves 4 vegetable oil 12 sage leaves salt and freshly ground white pepper 4 small lettuces, Cos or Baby Gem carrot, celeriac, onion and celery stalk, peeled and finely diced 25g unsalted butter 250ml veal stock 8 very thin slices streaky bacon plain flour 4 x 150g thin slices calf's liver 4 portions pomme pur\u00e9e 1. Deep-fry the sage leaves in hot vegetable oil, then drain well on kitchen paper. Season with a little salt. 2. Make the braised lettuce: halve the lettuces and blanch them quickly in boiling salted water, then refresh in cold water and drain well. Sweat the vegetable dice in the butter until they colour. Place the lettuce and diced vegetables in a pot and add the stock and some seasoning. Bring to the boil, cover, and braise for 10 to 15 minutes until tender. 3. Lightly grill the bacon without colouring. 4. Season and flour the liver, dusting off any excess. Pan-fry in 100ml hot oil until pink, a minute or so on each side depending on the thickness. 5. To serve, place the liver on a heap of braised lettuce, with two slices of bacon on top , and decorate with the sage. Serve with pomme pur\u00e9e. \u0095 This recipe was taken from The Mirabelle Cookbook, Ebury Press.",

      "body": "<p>Every morning I have porridge oats. I like it really thick, almost like a slab. I spread Marmite on toast as thick as jam. My mum used to love Marmite, but I couldn't even stand the smell. I grew to like it when I went through puberty. I always buy honey, the clear runny type. Sometimes I put it on my face to soften and refresh it but I mainly buy it to have in my herb tea - camomile really relaxes me, and I drink it all day. </p> <p>I always have salmon in any form really - smoked, tinned, grilled. I marinade it in a little teriyaki sauce and then cook it in foil. I also like to cook a roast chicken and then I pick at it all week. I'm also mad about peas, especially tinned mushy peas. My favorite carbohydrate is oven chips, - I get the healthy ones with only 5% fat. I usually keep a few cans of Mackeson's stout in the fridge. I love to have a little half pint with my dinner. It's sweeter than Guinness and it feels medicinal. I've always loved apples, any sort, as long as they're crunchy. I've discovered Benecol Light cheese spread. I slap it on a baked potato or spread it on Ryvita. For comfort food I don't think anything can beat a good old plain Cadbury's chocolate bar. I get very suspect about all these products that advertise themselves as being 'fat free' when, if you look at the ingredients they are stuffed with sugar. I think that if you are going to have sugar you might as well have a bar of chocolate. I also love wine, strong fruity wines where only a glass or two and you feel very relaxed.</p> <p><strong>Red wine </strong><br> Red wine can keep the heart healthy by increasing the body's production of 'good' cholesterol and providing it with such antioxidants as quercitin and procyanidin, which inhibit two of the steps in the chain of events that leads to the production of fatty plaques and hence blocked blood vessels. Too much alcohol, however, can send your energy levels crashing, upset your mood, disrupt your sleep and increase your risk of developing liver disease.</p> <p><strong>Benecol cheese spread</strong><br> Many people buy Benecol products because of the evidence that their plant esters can slightly improve the blood-fat profiles of people who have cholesterol problems. Yet not only are they expensive, but I prefer other nutritional ways of reducing your risk of developing heart disease. One of the best is to ensure that your intake of monounsaturated fats is high by regularly eating oily fish, peanuts, almonds and walnuts, as well as using olive oil or other vegetable oils. If, like Josie, you crave the taste of cheese, top a slice of fibre-rich, wholemeal bread with a sliver of naturally lower-fat cheese like Gouda.</p> <p><strong>Chicken </strong><br> In common with all protein-rich foods, chicken contains amino acids that can stimulate the body to generate endorphins like serotonin that make you feel happier (a useful quality in Josie's profession) and more energetic. As well as being naturally low in fat and protein-packed, chicken doesn't prompt the body to produce 'bad' cholesterol, making it a healthy choice for people who are trying to lose weight. Chicken also contains high levels of zinc, the mineral that is vital for the maintenance of an efficient immune system and robust libido. I would urge everyone to buy organic, free-range chicken, which usually tastes far better than chicken that has been intensively farmed.</p> <p><strong>Mackeson stout</strong><br> A point in stout's favour is that it frequently contains half the alcohol content of wine. Stout contains a few B vitamins and a little iron, giving credence to the old wives' tale that a glass of stout is a good tonic.</p> <p><strong>Porridge oats</strong><br> Oats are extremely high in fibre, making them one of the healthiest foods you could eat. They also contain a prebiotic agent called beta glucan, which encourages the growth of probiotic(healthy) bacteria which in turn stimulates the production of cancer-fighting substances. Because oats have a lower gluten content than wheat, people who have a gluten intolerance can safely enjoy a bowl of porridge or biscuits made with oats rather than flour.</p> <p><strong>Mushy peas</strong><br> Although fresh peas contain some vitamins and minerals, by the time they've been processed, few nutrients are left other than fibre. Fibre, however, plays an important role in keeping your digestive system healthy, and since mushy peas are soft, they're usually better for people who have digestive conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis and diverticulitis, than fresh peas.</p> <p><strong>Herbal teas</strong><br> You're probably tired of hearing that your body needs 2.5 litres water a day, but it's nevertheless true. Brewing herbal teas can be one of the best ways of jazzing up water and they often have inherent healing properties. Camomile acts as an effective destresser and sleep-inducer, while mint soothes an acidic gut and aids digestion.</p> <p><strong>Marmite</strong><br> Marmite-lovers, particularly vegetarians and vegans, benefit from its high vitamin B content, vitamins that are mainly found in foods of animal origin. Because it contains high levels of salt, Josie should eat potassium-rich foods, such as fresh fruits and vegetables, as well as drink lots of water.</p> <p><strong>Low-fat oven chips</strong><br> Low-fat oven chips are both less hassle to cook and significantly lower in calories than conventional, deep-fried chips. Despite their 5 per cent fat content, they still contain more calories than jacket potatoes and other non-fried foods, however, so think twice before piling them onto your plate.</p> <p><strong>Cox's eating apples </strong><br> Although an apple contains only 6mg of vitamin C per 100g, it can pack as much antioxidant punch as three 500mg vitamin C tablets because, unlike the tablets, it contains plant (or phyto-) nutrients and other powerful antioxidants. Its fibre can kick-start a lazy gut, while its nutrients can stimulate the body to produce substances that are particularly effective in reducing incidences of cancer of the digestive system. If eaten as part of the same meal, an apple can cushion the body's absorption of animal fats (in cheese, for instance), as well as providing a quick, convenient and energising snack.</p> <p><strong>Organic honey </strong><br> Although organic honey provides your body with a generous dose of energy-raising sugar, it has the same potential downsides as all types of refined sugar, including weight gain and dental cares. When consumed on an empty stomach, honey can send your energy levels soaring, at the same time, however, stimulating your pancreas to produce insulin, the hormone that will bring them rapidly down again, making you feel shaky. It's therefore best eaten with a fibre-containing food, like wholemeal, rather than white, toast.</p> <p>\u0095 Josie Lawrence is to replace Elaine Paige as Anna in The London Palladium's The King and I from 24 April.</p>",

      "body": "<p>It was the English obsession with going for a walk that landed Annie Hawes in trouble. She and her sister Lucy were scrambling up a Ligurian hillside under the broiling Italian sun when they spotted a tumbledown house. While Lucy ate cherries off the tree on the terrace, Annie climbed in through a loose shutter to explore. Her immediate reaction was inevitable: 'I want it very badly. It ought to be mine.'</p> <p>Unbeknown to the girls they had been observed by a neighbour tending his olives. Frank the Knife rightly surmised they must be the English girls employed down in the valley to graft Pattrucho's roses; after all nobody but an English or German would go for a walk in the middle of the day making quite so much noise. Ever the wheeler-dealer, Frank knew his neighbour Pompeo had little use for his old rustica, so he stepped in to introduce himself...</p> <p>Thus it came about that 15 years ago, despite their genuine protestations at being broke, Annie and Lucy acquired a house, two wells and an olive grove for \u00a32,000. 'After all,' argued Frank, 'Pattrucho has just paid you your month's wages and that could be the deposit.' They were helpless in the teeth of such persuasion. This week Annie's glorious tale of gradually being assimilated into the small, close community that she now considers home - Extra Virgin: Amongst the Olive Groves of Liguria - is published. </p> <p> A visit is like stepping into the book. I am sitting on a terrace that was already familiar, looking across a valley terraced with olive groves mid-harvest, and I know the names and characters of many of the people rolling up their olive nets. Annie has collected me and Andy the photographer from the coastal sin city, Diano de Marina, and driven in the style of a true Italian up through the little village of San Pietro where she and Lucy first lodged (sleeping in 59-minute bursts between the earsplitting tolling of the campanile clock) past the olive mill where a German crashed through the roof after trying to commit suicide off the motorway bridge above but landed in a lorryful of olives, and round the 12 sick-making hairpin bends. There is so much affectionate detail about the place and its people in the book that there are countless things to look out for, not least the 48-year-old author herself. When you've really, really enjoyed a book you so desperately want to like the writer, you dread them turning out to be a complete monster. Annie, thankfully, is no disappointment. Her car is chaos, she is a whirlwind of apology for being late, for not having had time to wash her hair for the photographs. She is warm, funny, idiosyncratic and a dedicated people watcher. Everybody knows her and honks and waves as we reverse down the precipitous road to let each other past.</p> <p>The book grew out of the stories she would tell her friends when she was forced to return to her flat in Shepherd's Bush to earn some more money. Annie embraced Italian life wholeheartedly from the word go. With an aptitude for languages and a smattering of Italian, she'd chatter away to people, gradually getting the hang of the Liguarian dialect. In fact the book - which took her three years - was considerably longer originally: 'I couldn't find the word count thing on the laptop so I just kept on going. When I finally printed it out at my brother's house in Cardiff, it took the whole day. I'd written 600 pages.' She did her homework by reading Bill Bryson, Peter Mayle and Frances Mayes. </p> <p>Wasn't she worried she'd absorb their style, I ask?</p> <p>No, says Annie with characteristic certainty. And anyway neither Bryson nor Mayle are properly interested in people. No danger of that with Annie's narrative; local personalities leap off the page, invariably cooking, eating and discussing the digestion, usually ticking the girls off for drinking too much coffee before lunch, eating food in the wrong order (surely everybody everywhere must eat antipasto, primo piatto and secondo?), chopping and dressing salads incorrectly.</p> <p>Annie, 48, grew up in 'the unfashionable end of the Cotswolds' and Edinburgh - the eldest of five children of whom Lucy is number four (42); the rest are brothers (James has written two successful novels, one of which Rancid Aluminium was made into a film), all of whom crop up in the book. Her life is packed with rackety incidents. She ran away to Portugal and married her Irish/Jamaican boyfriend at 16 'because my mother said he wasn't intelligent enough for me, which I took to be a code word for blackness'. The relationship collapsed almost at once, but Annie stayed on in Portugal for a year (she speaks that fluently too) and never bothered to divorce him which deeply concerns her new accountant. Her parents were teachers, Lucy is also one, and all the boys have written, or are writing, books. 'Lucy', who features constantly and hilariously throughout the book, usually referred to as 'the evil sister', is not her real name.</p> <p>'She got very angry that I had included her in the book,' says Annie. 'She hates the idea that somebody might recognise her, particularly one of the children at her school, she's very odd.'</p> <p>This does seem peculiar because Lucy spends chunks of the books at the various village festa dancing mazurkas badly when sufficiently fortified by local wine. </p> <p>'Yes, and then she goes into a long fit of depression at how badly she behaved. I know she's odd because she can't write cheques in front of people.'</p> <p>However, Lucy is not the only one full of surprises; there are two major omissions from the book. One is Annie's 20-year-old son, Tom, an art student in Bourne-mouth, whom she left out from tact but he's miffed. The relationship with his dad, Robert, finished when Tom was still a baby but they shared his upbringing quite amicably and Robert is now a balloonist in Tuscany. Nothing surprising about this; after a short time in Annie's company your amazement level simply readjusts. The fact that we are sitting in the Italian sunshine at all is born out of her pretence she could graft roses and accompany her sister on a short working holiday. Similarly she has busked her way as a switchboard operator, film editor, film producer and law clerk. None of her other relationships lasted long enough to have another baby, but she did look into adoption when Tom was little as she felt sorry for him being an only child. 'There were only black children up for adoption which was fine by me, but the social services turned me down saying I wouldn't be able to integrate the child culturally, and why didn't I think about adopting a disturbed teenager instead? With a three-year-old, I ask you!'</p> <p>The other surprise is her lovely partner of nine years, Ciccio, who flits in and out of the narrative as one of the local boys who help them renovate the house as a way of escaping the formality of their own homes on a Sunday to listen to football loudly on the radio. There's a hint at the very end of the book that a relationship might have started, but it's very subtle. His parents grow olives on the other side of the valley, the red roof of their house clearly visible from the terrace. </p> <p>'Ciccio was always my favourite person here, but I'm not really sure how the romance started,' muses Annie. 'I gave him the key years ago so he could use the house to play poker with his friends, and then when our neighbour Domenico died Ciccio started looking after the olives for me, so really he crept up on the terrain before he crept up on me. I think he first kissed me round the back of his restaurant.'</p> <p>A wonderful cook (he had a restaurant up the valley for a while) Ciccio, 48, who runs his own garden business, is in charge of lunch today ('How will I ever lose weight?' moans Annie). He has nipped across the valley to his mother's larder (quite acceptable behaviour apparently from an Italian son) and returned with a treasure trove of small green tomatoes, anchovies, pasta, a demi-john of their own white wine ('very strong,' he warned, and how right he was). This is followed by a frittata of wild garlic heads picked nearby. Every now and again he will swoop on Annie and kiss her, causing our photographer to leap for his camera.</p> <p>'We had a little trouble after about seven years,' he says, 'but now we're fine. At the beginning it was difficult letting my father know I was involved with a woman with a child, but now he is okay with it. He was always more difficult to approach about it than my mother, something about being the only son. And anyway all my sisters have got divorced.'</p> <p>San Pietro is now home for Annie, though she's kept the Shepherd's Bush flat on for Tom. The house, while still very rustic, is a far cry from the early days of an earth closet up the garden, outdoor shower behind a large rock and hauling every drop of water out of the well by bucket. Adopting the sensible peasant approach to furnishing, virtually everything useful is a found, rather than purchased, object. The gas fridge came from an abandoned German camper van, Ciccio found the huge wood-burning cooker when it was being discarded by an old lady. The solar panel was buried under vines in a bush nearby, and generates sufficient electricity to provide power for either television and music or Annie's laptop - a good excuse, she found, to stop writing. Even the terrier just arrived one day, fed up with her previous existence further up the hill. This is simply an extension of the local habit of continually wandering about tweaking bits of tasty food off the hillsides: wild asparagus, mushrooms, fennel, borage, wild garlic, lemons.</p> <p>Annie and Ciccio have now bought themselves another house further up the valley. As so often seems to happen round there, they heard about it from some friends in a bar and went straight out to clinch the deal - a handsome 25-room traditional house overlooking a river on the edge of a village for \u00a312,000. Indeed, Annie's friend Terry is here to put down some new floorboards ('Aren't you Terry?' says Annie firmly). </p> <p>Annie is wary that local people might not like her book and has refused to sign with an Italian publisher.</p> <p>'Nobody reads books in Italy anyway,' she says. 'They're all far too busy talking, spreading gossip, scandal and innuendo. There was a review on satellite usage recently and they're mainly used for mobile phones - nobody bothers with the internet because it would involve reading.</p> <p>'I do love all the talking up to a point, but the huge gatherings can get me down. Particularly as you have to drive around collecting people in a huge car convoy and then going to the place - they won't hear of meeting you there. I'm gregarious up to a point and then I have to have total solitude for at least two days.'</p> <p> Frank the Knife, who posed for the handsome diary Penguin have produced has already declared himself offended by a picture that he considers makes him look old rather than one with his horse, particularly as he is famed throughout the area for riding it into a bar one day to avenge his sister. Ciccio has so far read only five chapters and Annie is confident he will get no further. </p> <p>'Since doing the book I've got into the habit of not doing something if I don't want to. I realised this when I was recording the audiobook last month and thought after two hours \"oh well that's quite enough of that now\" and having to go on for another five hours.'</p> <p>And now? Annie quite fancies writing a thriller and there's already enough material that didn't get into Extra Virgin for a sequel, and doing up another house will be a whole new story. But why hurry? There's the terrace, the view, and Ciccio's wine and cooking.</p>",

In fact the book - which took her three years - was considerably longer originally: 'I couldn't find the word count thing on the laptop so I just kept on going. When I finally printed it out at my brother's house in Cardiff, it took the whole day. I'd written 600 pages.' She did her homework by reading Bill Bryson, Peter Mayle and Frances Mayes. Wasn't she worried she'd absorb their style, I ask? No, says Annie with characteristic certainty. And anyway neither Bryson nor Mayle are properly interested in people. No danger of that with Annie's narrative; local personalities leap off the page, invariably cooking, eating and discussing the digestion, usually ticking the girls off for drinking too much coffee before lunch, eating food in the wrong order (surely everybody everywhere must eat antipasto, primo piatto and secondo?), chopping and dressing salads incorrectly. Annie, 48, grew up in 'the unfashionable end of the Cotswolds' and Edinburgh - the eldest of five children of whom Lucy is number four (42); the rest are brothers (James has written two successful novels, one of which Rancid Aluminium was made into a film), all of whom crop up in the book. Her life is packed with rackety incidents. She ran away to Portugal and married her Irish/Jamaican boyfriend at 16 'because my mother said he wasn't intelligent enough for me, which I took to be a code word for blackness'. The relationship collapsed almost at once, but Annie stayed on in Portugal for a year (she speaks that fluently too) and never bothered to divorce him which deeply concerns her new accountant. Her parents were teachers, Lucy is also one, and all the boys have written, or are writing, books. 'Lucy', who features constantly and hilariously throughout the book, usually referred to as 'the evil sister', is not her real name. 'She got very angry that I had included her in the book,' says Annie. 'She hates the idea that somebody might recognise her, particularly one of the children at her school, she's very odd.' This does seem peculiar because Lucy spends chunks of the books at the various village festa dancing mazurkas badly when sufficiently fortified by local wine. 'Yes, and then she goes into a long fit of depression at how badly she behaved. I know she's odd because she can't write cheques in front of people.' However, Lucy is not the only one full of surprises; there are two major omissions from the book. One is Annie's 20-year-old son, Tom, an art student in Bourne-mouth, whom she left out from tact but he's miffed. The relationship with his dad, Robert, finished when Tom was still a baby but they shared his upbringing quite amicably and Robert is now a balloonist in Tuscany. Nothing surprising about this; after a short time in Annie's company your amazement level simply readjusts. The fact that we are sitting in the Italian sunshine at all is born out of her pretence she could graft roses and accompany her sister on a short working holiday. Similarly she has busked her way as a switchboard operator, film editor, film producer and law clerk. None of her other relationships lasted long enough to have another baby, but she did look into adoption when Tom was little as she felt sorry for him being an only child. 'There were only black children up for adoption which was fine by me, but the social services turned me down saying I wouldn't be able to integrate the child culturally, and why didn't I think about adopting a disturbed teenager instead? With a three-year-old, I ask you!' The other surprise is her lovely partner of nine years, Ciccio, who flits in and out of the narrative as one of the local boys who help them renovate the house as a way of escaping the formality of their own homes on a Sunday to listen to football loudly on the radio. There's a hint at the very end of the book that a relationship might have started, but it's very subtle. His parents grow olives on the other side of the valley, the red roof of their house clearly visible from the terrace. 'Ciccio was always my favourite person here, but I'm not really sure how the romance started,' muses Annie. 'I gave him the key years ago so he could use the house to play poker with his friends, and then when our neighbour Domenico died Ciccio started looking after the olives for me, so really he crept up on the terrain before he crept up on me. I think he first kissed me round the back of his restaurant.' A wonderful cook (he had a restaurant up the valley for a while) Ciccio, 48, who runs his own garden business, is in charge of lunch today ('How will I ever lose weight?' moans Annie). He has nipped across the valley to his mother's larder (quite acceptable behaviour apparently from an Italian son) and returned with a treasure trove of small green tomatoes, anchovies, pasta, a demi-john of their own white wine ('very strong,' he warned, and how right he was). This is followed by a frittata of wild garlic heads picked nearby. Every now and again he will swoop on Annie and kiss her, causing our photographer to leap for his camera. 'We had a little trouble after about seven years,' he says, 'but now we're fine. At the beginning it was difficult letting my father know I was involved with a woman with a child, but now he is okay with it. He was always more difficult to approach about it than my mother, something about being the only son. And anyway all my sisters have got divorced.' San Pietro is now home for Annie, though she's kept the Shepherd's Bush flat on for Tom. The house, while still very rustic, is a far cry from the early days of an earth closet up the garden, outdoor shower behind a large rock and hauling every drop of water out of the well by bucket. Adopting the sensible peasant approach to furnishing, virtually everything useful is a found, rather than purchased, object. The gas fridge came from an abandoned German camper van, Ciccio found the huge wood-burning cooker when it was being discarded by an old lady. The solar panel was buried under vines in a bush nearby, and generates sufficient electricity to provide power for either television and music or Annie's laptop - a good excuse, she found, to stop writing. Even the terrier just arrived one day, fed up with her previous existence further up the hill. This is simply an extension of the local habit of continually wandering about tweaking bits of tasty food off the hillsides: wild asparagus, mushrooms, fennel, borage, wild garlic, lemons. Annie and Ciccio have now bought themselves another house further up the valley. As so often seems to happen round there, they heard about it from some friends in a bar and went straight out to clinch the deal - a handsome 25-room traditional house overlooking a river on the edge of a village for \u00a312,000. Indeed, Annie's friend Terry is here to put down some new floorboards ('Aren't you Terry?' says Annie firmly). Annie is wary that local people might not like her book and has refused to sign with an Italian publisher. 'Nobody reads books in Italy anyway,' she says. 'They're all far too busy talking, spreading gossip, scandal and innuendo. There was a review on satellite usage recently and they're mainly used for mobile phones - nobody bothers with the internet because it would involve reading. 'I do love all the talking up to a point, but the huge gatherings can get me down. Particularly as you have to drive around collecting people in a huge car convoy and then going to the place - they won't hear of meeting you there. I'm gregarious up to a point and then I have to have total solitude for at least two days.' Frank the Knife, who posed for the handsome diary Penguin have produced has already declared himself offended by a picture that he considers makes him look old rather than one with his horse, particularly as he is famed throughout the area for riding it into a bar one day to avenge his sister. Ciccio has so far read only five chapters and Annie is confident he will get no further. 'Since doing the book I've got into the habit of not doing something if I don't want to. I realised this when I was recording the audiobook last month and thought after two hours \"oh well that's quite enough of that now\" and having to go on for another five hours.' And now? Annie quite fancies writing a thriller and there's already enough material that didn't get into Extra Virgin for a sequel, and doing up another house will be a whole new story. But why hurry? There's the terrace, the view, and Ciccio's wine and cooking.",

      "body": "<p>At 1:50 p.m. on 7 September last year, actor Christopher Walken sat in the driver's seat of his black Cadillac Seville sedan, in a parking space on the street in front of his second residence, a ground-floor apartment on West 80th Street, New York. He was wearing a black T-shirt and faded black cotton pants with an elastic waistband. A pair of tortoise-shell reading glasses hung from his shirt.</p> <p>He entered his apartment, a duplex that is mostly utilised by his wife of over 30 years, Georgianne, who works in Manhattan as a casting agent. To the right, in the spacious living room, were two enormous canvases painted by his good friend, Julian Schnabel. To the left, with a breakfast nook looking out onto the street, was the kitchen. Pottery bowls with chopped vegetables - zucchini, summer squash, and onion - sat on the counter, above which, on a shelf, was an old cigar box painted with the word 'Smile' next to a photograph of a cute cat, who, he explained, crestfallen, succumbed to 'that feline leukemia'. In the corner, near a telephone was a black-and-white print of Jerry Lewis, doing his signature drinking-glass-in-the-mouth bit, taken at the Tony Awards. </p> <p>Walken crushed a whole bulb of garlic with alarming force on the counter top, and began chopping with a menacing looking butcher's knife. He pulled out a frying pan, put it down on the white Whirlpool electric stove and began rummaging through the drawers for a spatula, which he seemed unable to find.</p> <p>'It's a long time since I was cooking here' he said. My wife uses this place. She buys this stuff. I have gas in Connecticut, which is much nicer. This is hard. An electric oven isn't bad, but a gas top is much better. In Connecticut I have an electric oven with a gas top. This is hard. I don't know what's going to happen. You don't look very comfortable. Why don't you sit down? Oh, great, I forgot to turn the burner on.</p> <p>'Cooking is like the family business. My father was a baker all his life. He comes from a big family in Germany. His father was a baker. His brothers are bakers. He came to America and opened a bakery in Queens and had it for 60 years. That's where I came from this morning. My mother broke her hip. It's a drag, because they live in a house and suddenly they can't go up and down stairs.'</p> <p>Walken began his first dish, Zucchini Linguine, by heating olive oil in the skillet.</p> <p>'I'm putting some garlic in. New York is great for produce. Those Korean markets always have very fresh stuff.</p> <p>'My brothers and I were in show business when we were kids, but we also worked in the bakery. I used to deliver cakes in a station wagon and work in the back of the bakery. I was the guy that put the jelly in the doughnuts. In those days, you'd have a huge can with a plunger on it. It had these two really big needles sticking out each side. You'd take two doughnuts - they'd already be cooked - stick them on those needle things. Then you push the plunger down, and you feel them fill up. There'd usually be a little dribble of jelly on the end. Actually, it was rather sensual.' </p> <p>He added onion, then red pepper, then the zucchini and summer squash to the sizzling pan.</p> <p>'My mother wasn't much of a cook. I mean she was okay. She used to overcook everything. She came over from Scotland and used to make interesting things, things that I never see any more, like oxtails - you know, real I guess the word is \"peasant\" food. Things like the linings of things.</p> <p>'My father likes that German food. He used to drink sauerkraut juice. He's 97 years old and he eats this incredibly high-cholesterol stuff. All those big sausages. He eats knockwurst and washes it down with beer. And he eats head cheese, which is basically these big chunks of fat in gelatin made into a loaf. It's like eating solid fat. And he's a skinny guy. My cholesterol is good. Every time I go to the doctor, he swoons in ecstasy over my blood pressure. I've got some incredible blood pressure. When I was a kid, I'd pass out sometimes, because I'd get real slow. The blood, you know. But when you get older, that's good.'</p> <p>Walken tossed vegetables, added dill and juiced a lemon into the pan, picking out the seeds afterwards. He immersed dry pasta in boiling water.</p> <p> 'At one point I had a pasta machine. I tried that. They make it look easy. But it's not. Making your own pasta is not easy.</p> <p>'Now I could put some olives here. You like olives? I put some lemon juice in there, too.</p> <p>'When I was a kid, every day in the house there was cake, cookies, chocolate cream pies. Every week, the cleaning lady would take home a huge bag of stuff. You'd think it'd be great. In the bakery, I used to make these big vats of melted chocolate. The smell of sugar in that quantity is overwhelming. It's almost too much.</p> <p>'Now, I never eat dessert. I eat sweets very rarely. I don't eat sugar. In the morning, when I have coffee, I put molasses in it. It's very good. When I go to a restaurant, people always have dessert, and I always skip it. I might have some cheese or something like that.'</p> <p>Walken poured the saut\u00e9ed vegetables into a bowl and put them aside, then tasted the pasta, which was not yet done. He reached into the refrigerator and emerged with a white-paper-wrapped package, which he began to unwrap.</p> <p>'On pasta, they say 12 minutes,' he said, 'but I always try to keep an eye on it. This is salmon from Citarella. There's one right down the street. I was just working in Nova Scotia and Halifax. You get the most incredible fish there. Mussels that don't really taste like mussels you ever had before. The salmon, it's unbelievable. Chilean sea bass, you know you don't get it a lot here, but when I go to California, they have it all the time. It's such a gorgeous thing. You get a great big chunk of it and you bake it. It's just fabulous. In California they have all these great things like abalone [shellfish]. It's fabulous. But it's very expensive.</p> <p>'For me, cooking is something that I do when I'm studying scripts. I put the script on the counter and I cook and study my lines at the same time. It's the power of distraction, I find. I've read that a lot of people do one thing while there's something that they're doing at the same time. Some people play cards or garden. I cook. My wife doesn't cook. That's actually common. I think more men cook than women cook.'</p> <p>Walken laid the salmon on the counter and began cutting into it.</p> <p>'I don't cut through the skin,' he said. 'I just score it in portion sizes and leave the skin hanging off.</p> <p>'You need to watch your weight in the movie business. It's just a practical thing. Actors are always on some sort of diet. There's a lot of sitting around on movie sets and actors are always sitting on their chairs and talking about food. It may be because they're on a diet and thinking about it a lot. It's true that the camera is very cruel. It makes you look heavier than you are. And movie food is generally very good, because they have to make sure the technicians are happy. They like a nice big lunch with dessert. It's tempting. You've got to watch yourself.</p> <p>'Buffets are very dangerous. A lot of actors I know gain 15 pounds when they make a movie. I was in a movie once - I don't want to say which - that took eight months to make. Movies are not shot in sequence, so you could watch it and see the people in the movie getting bigger and smaller. Sometimes I go to these movie events, and there'll be a buffet with very good food. You'll see all these important, wealthy people standing on line getting huge plates of it. They don't need it. But psychologically, I guess it's some primitive thing. Somebody's got to eat it.</p> <p>'I try to keep the icebox fairly empty, and just buy things as I want them. I only eat once a day. Usually about seven o'clock. If I have things to do, eating slows me down. I feel like I'm underwater.'</p> <p>Walken left the fish for a moment, and ripped open a paper-wrapped jar, the dark, gelatinous contents of which he spooned into a mixing bowl.</p> <p>'That's chutney, and I'm going to put a big thing of it in there. And I have some garlic that's already chopped. And sea salt. I'm going to put a little lemon in there and mix it up. I have some coriander here. People don't use coriander much, but it's really good.</p> <p>'I eat slowly. It takes me a long time. I usually watch TV, just flip around and find these great movies that I didn't know even existed. That's the best thing about that cable. I just saw an incredible musical with a lot of black performers called Stormy Weather. The last 20 minutes of that are as good as any musical I ever saw. Then I fall right asleep.</p> <p>'I don't go out to eat much. Occasionally I go to these very fancy restaurants on an anniversary or a birthday or something. I don't want to name any names, but I haven't really been knocked out in the last few years. In the old days - this is 20 years ago - I used to take my wife to Lut\u00e8ce [an old established restaurant on the Upper Eastside] on her anniversary or birthday. That used to be wonderful. It probably still is. But I went to one of the big ones recently. The bill was unbelievable. For three people it was like 300 bucks apiece. I had duck or something like that. Anyway, it was good. But I make a tremendous duck. You have to steam a duck first. I don't think many people do that. This amazing amount of fat comes off. Then you put it on a rack. You stuff it with garlic and oranges, you know, salt, pepper, some herb, whatever that might be. And you put it on the rack and roast it, and it comes out really crispy. I got that from the Julia Child Cookbook. Her cookbooks are wonderful, Julia Child.'</p> <p>After tossing the linguini into a colander, Walken brought the chutney sauce over to the salmon fillet and began massaging the sauce into the fish.</p> <p>'Oh, incidentally,' he said, 'my hands may look dirty, but that's paint on them. I was painting. I'm going to take this sauce and put this on the top. You scored it, so it kind of gets down into the holes.</p> <p>'I love Mexican cooking. It's so much more than people know. Here it's, you know, guacamole and enchiladas. I like eating spaghetti. I could eat it every day and I have to watch that. I like French food but sometimes it's very rich. I was in Japan once, and I said to the people I was with, you know, \"I love Japanese food, so I would like to have some real authentic Japanese food\". And they took me to this restaurant and gave me a bowl of what looked like some pasta. I looked at it. There were all these little eyes, and the whole thing was moving. I think they were little white eels. I did have some of it to be polite. That was tough. I had to take it down with some beer.'</p> <p>Walken carried the fish over to where a baking tray is arrayed with a bed of onions, and slapped the fish, sauce-side down, onto the onions.</p> <p>'All right now,' he said. 'I have this pan with all these onions I did. I saut\u00e9ed them a little bit.</p> <p>'During movies, I bring my own food. I have various Tupperware containers. And every time I go away for any extended time, I'll stay in an apartment or a hotel that has a kitchen. When I was a kid, I was in musicals, and there'd be the dancers, you know, these crazy gypsies. They'd show up in the little hotel with a suitcase, open it up, and it had every kind of cooking utensil. They would cook these incredible dinners from nothing. Thanksgiving would come and they'd cook this huge turkey in the room. I don't know how they did it.'</p> <p>Walken popped the salmon into the oven. 'It's on broil,' he said. 'I don't time it. You can sort of tell by touching it.</p> <p>'I've had to stay in places where there only was a microwave. It's not recommended, but you can actually cook certain fish in a microwave. Salmon you can cook practically anywhere. And if you're living like a hobo in a hotel room, you can make amazing things in crockpots. You can stick a chicken in there with some vegetables. Turn it on real low and just leave it there all day. And when you come back it's fabulous.'</p> <p>Walken pulled out a package of jumbo prawns from the refrigerator and, grasping them in his hands, cut through them with the butcher knife, then ran them under water.</p> <p>'This is a little dangerous,' he said. 'You know you're never supposed to cut like this. You can cut your hand off. You see, you butterfly it. And then there's this vein in there. You want to get rid of that. It's guts, I guess. You want to get those nice and clean.</p> <p>'I almost did a cooking show. I went to Bravo and MTV and the Comedy Channel. I had meetings with these people and I was going to do this show. It was either 10 or 12 segments. I can't remember. I was going to have some sort of kitchen set-up. I wanted it to be a little like Pee-wee's Playhouse. I love that show. And I'd have maybe a showgirl, you know, with a little thing on, chopping my vegetables. Maybe some musicians. And an audience. Some people to talk to.'</p> <p>Walken laid the prawns into a sizzling frying pan, in which he had saut\u00e9ed some chopped garlic in olive oil. He squeezed an orange into a coffee mug that read 'Notre Dame High School, 25th Class Reunion, Class of 1967'. </p> <p>'I'm going to throw a little more garlic in there,' he said. 'You want a little more coriander in the shrimp. You put them in shell down in the hot oil - but the next part is a little tricky, some say dangerous. What I've got here is some rum, and I'm squeezing a little bit of orange juice in the rum. You got to wait until these shrimps get a little white. These are big, so they're taking a while.</p> <p>'I remember Dean Martin's old shows, when he had the Gold Diggers. It was a fabulous show. They say they had the whole thing set up and he'd get in his car and drive from his house, park the car, walk into the studio and do it completely off the cuff. You'd watch it and you could tell that he didn't really know what was going on. And every time things got a little rough, these showgirls called the Gold Diggers - these gorgeous girls - would come on and do this dance number. That's sort of what I had in mind.'</p> <p>Satisfied the prawns were sufficiently opaque, Walken grabbed the rum, turned the burner up and tossed the rum into the pan, then quickly covered it with a lid. It sizzled loudly.</p> <p>'This top isn't quite tight enough, but it works,' he said. 'It's like a big sudden steam bath.</p> <p>'With the cable, the thing was, when it got down to it, every one of them wanted something much more precise. They wanted it to be much more planned. Much more of a pragmatic, fabricated thing that could be repeated. They wanted to have a comic actor with me. They wanted to have a script. Jokes. I like jokes. But I wouldn't want to have to say the jokes, you know. Because certain times things are funny anyway. I mean, funny people are funny. And I said to them I wouldn't be able to do that. I wanted it to be like the Dean Martin show.'</p> <p>The meal was done. Walken tossed the vegetables and pasta together, pulled out some small wine glasses, a couple of plates and a half bottle of 1998 Corvo, a white Italian table wine. He carried a canister of sour cream over to the table for the pasta. </p> <p>'I usually put some sour cream on that,' he said. 'It's up to you. I'll tell you a really simple thing if you're going to have people over. It's expensive, but you get a thing of caviar - you can use the red caviar. But one of the best things in the world is linguine, a big thing of sour cream in the middle and a big scoop of caviar. With some pepper. It's like the best. Anybody can make it. Piece of bread? It's nice bread. Just a little corner? I'll get you a napkin. I'm gonna give you food. I'm not going to eat today. I'll eat later.'</p> <p>Afterwards Walken washed the dishes. He cleaned the sink with a sponge. He put the leftovers in Tupperware. Then he tossed a few paper towels on the ground and wiped the floor by skating around on top of the towel with a stockinged foot.</p> <p>'Coriander is very hard to clean,' he said. 'All these little green things.</p> <p>'If I wasn't so lazy, I'll tell you what I would do. I saw this thing on television. This whole thing with people putting cameras in their house, for the net. I understand that people outfit their houses with these things, and some guy's girlfriend finds out that she's been naked all over the Internet. You hear about that. If everybody can do it, it can't be that hard. You just need to figure out where to tune in, right? I would need some help with this. I don't quite understand how the Internet works. I don't have a computer. You know, 12-year-old kids know all about that.</p> <p>'I thought I'd get a couple of those cameras and put them in my kitchen in Connecticut and just, you know, turn them on whenever I felt like it. Maybe I would have a particular time of day I would do it, or something like that. You could charge people to take hits, or something like that. And it would just be me cooking. And I thought to make it amusing, I thought I would have a hotline - you know, a red telephone. And they could call and I could give them advice about their love life. I mean silly stuff, personal questions, about them, you know, \"What should I do?\" In the old days, there used to be these things - I can't remember what they're called, but it's a Spanish word. Like a bodega, but something else. They'd be on street corners. You could buy a love potion. You could buy, you know, something, if you were mad at somebody, you could buy a hex. They even had aerosol, I remember - you could spray somebody to get them to fall in love with you or something. I could provide services like that. Or just talk while I'm cooking.'</p> <p>Walken sat down at the kitchen table.</p> <p>'And you remember a programme called This Is Your Life? I thought I'd have a curtain over to one side and once in a while I'd have a mystery guest. You know, actors are always coming over to my house. Maybe Joe Pesci comes over and makes his tomato sauce. Everybody makes something, you know what I mean. Don't you think that might be amusing? </p> <p>'Or I could do restaurant reviews. Like Ruth Reichl, I could walk in with a big disguise. Like a great big wig. Like everybody would know, they'd be like, \"Oh, here comes Chris with a big wig. Who's he kidding with those big dark glasses?\" Or I could dress up like a woman. Get dressed up with a big fur coat, and I could pretend it's not me.'</p> <p>Christopher Walken said he would eat later.</p> <p><strong> Christopher Walken's TNT Prawn Appetizer</strong><br> Serves four</p> <p><strong> 1 cup dark rum</strong><br><strong> juice of 1 orange </strong><br><strong> 4 jumbo prawn, fresh, with shells left on </strong><br><strong>salt and pepper </strong><br><strong> 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped </strong><br><strong> 2 tablespoons olive oil</strong></p> <p>Combine the rum and orange juice. Leaving the shell on, butterfly the prawns by slicing them with a sharp knife, cutting from back to legs, so that they lie flat, shell-side down, and the two halves approximate the shape of a heart. Wash and gut them under cold water. Salt and pepper the prawns liberally. In a skillet over medium heat, brown the garlic. Arrange the prawns in the pan, shell-side down, and saut\u00e9 for about four minutes, or until most of the body has become opaque. Turn the heat to high. When the skillet begins to sizzle, add the rum and orange juice mixture and immediately slam a tight cover on the skillet, pressing down firmly so that very little steam can escape. Keep the cover pressed down for about 3 minutes. Remove from heat, and uncover. The prawns should look fat, blackened and engorged. Serve from the pan, shell-side down, covering the prawns with the remaining rum sauce.</p> <p><strong> Christopher Walken's Courgette Linguine</strong><br> Serves four</p> <p><strong> 3 cloves garlic, minced</strong><br><strong> 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil </strong><br><strong> 1 onion, diced </strong><br><strong> 2 red bell peppers, diced </strong><br><strong>2 courgette, cut into 1/2-inch half-wheels </strong><br><strong> 2 summer squash, cut similarly </strong><br><strong> salt and pepper</strong><br><strong>1/2 cup fresh dill, chopped </strong><br><strong> 10 large kalamata olives, sliced (optional) </strong><br><strong> juice of 1 lemon</strong><br><strong> 450g linguine (Walken uses De Cecco) </strong><br><strong> 4 tbsp sour cream</strong></p> <p>Lightly brown the garlic in the olive oil in a large skillet, on medium heat. Add the onion and red peppers, and saut\u00e9 until soft. Add the courgettes and summer squash, and saut\u00e9 until soft but not wilted. Salt and pepper to taste. Finally, add the dill, lemon juice and olives. Toss together and remove from heat. Toss the mixture with al dente linguine. Garnish with sour cream.</p> <p> <strong> Christopher Walken's New Delhi Salmon </strong><br> Serves four</p> <p><strong> 750g fresh salmon fillet, skin left on</strong><br><strong> 2 tbsp olive oil </strong><br><strong>1 tbsp sea salt </strong><br><strong> 1 onion, chopped into 1/2-inch segments</strong><br><strong> 1 jar chutney (Walken used Major Grey's, you could substitute a mild mango) </strong><br><strong> 3 cloves garlic, finely chopped </strong><br><strong>1/2 cup fresh coriander, chopped</strong><br><strong> juice of one lemon</strong></p> <p>Preheat the grill. With a sharp knife, cut the salmon fillet crosswise into four portions, but do not break the salmon skin. Rub about two tablespoons of olive oil on the scored piece of salmon and into its crevices, then rub in about a tablespoon of sea salt. Put aside. In a saucepan, lightly brown the onion slices. Pile the browned onion onto greaseproof paper or Pyrex plate, forming a bed of onions with the approximate area as the salmon fillet. In a small mixing bowl, combine the chutney, garlic, coriander and lemon juice. Massage this mixture onto the top of the salmon fillet, making sure that some sauce falls into the crevices. Then take the salmon fillet and slam it down on top of the onion bed, so that the skin is facing up and the sauce side is down. Place the pan under a medium grill for about 20 minutes, or until the skin is burnt and the middle of the fillet is hot to the touch and dark pink. Remove the skin and serve from the pan, sauce- and-onion-side down.</p> <p>\u00a9 Andrew Goldman</p>",

Pottery bowls with chopped vegetables - zucchini, summer squash, and onion - sat on the counter, above which, on a shelf, was an old cigar box painted with the word 'Smile' next to a photograph of a cute cat, who, he explained, crestfallen, succumbed to 'that feline leukemia'. In the corner, near a telephone was a black-and-white print of Jerry Lewis, doing his signature drinking-glass-in-the-mouth bit, taken at the Tony Awards. Walken crushed a whole bulb of garlic with alarming force on the counter top, and began chopping with a menacing looking butcher's knife. He pulled out a frying pan, put it down on the white Whirlpool electric stove and began rummaging through the drawers for a spatula, which he seemed unable to find. 'It's a long time since I was cooking here' he said. My wife uses this place. She buys this stuff. I have gas in Connecticut, which is much nicer. This is hard. An electric oven isn't bad, but a gas top is much better. In Connecticut I have an electric oven with a gas top. This is hard. I don't know what's going to happen. You don't look very comfortable. Why don't you sit down? Oh, great, I forgot to turn the burner on. 'Cooking is like the family business. My father was a baker all his life. He comes from a big family in Germany. His father was a baker. His brothers are bakers. He came to America and opened a bakery in Queens and had it for 60 years. That's where I came from this morning. My mother broke her hip. It's a drag, because they live in a house and suddenly they can't go up and down stairs.' Walken began his first dish, Zucchini Linguine, by heating olive oil in the skillet. 'I'm putting some garlic in. New York is great for produce. Those Korean markets always have very fresh stuff. 'My brothers and I were in show business when we were kids, but we also worked in the bakery. I used to deliver cakes in a station wagon and work in the back of the bakery. I was the guy that put the jelly in the doughnuts. In those days, you'd have a huge can with a plunger on it. It had these two really big needles sticking out each side. You'd take two doughnuts - they'd already be cooked - stick them on those needle things. Then you push the plunger down, and you feel them fill up. There'd usually be a little dribble of jelly on the end. Actually, it was rather sensual.' He added onion, then red pepper, then the zucchini and summer squash to the sizzling pan. 'My mother wasn't much of a cook. I mean she was okay. She used to overcook everything. She came over from Scotland and used to make interesting things, things that I never see any more, like oxtails - you know, real I guess the word is \"peasant\" food. Things like the linings of things. 'My father likes that German food. He used to drink sauerkraut juice. He's 97 years old and he eats this incredibly high-cholesterol stuff. All those big sausages. He eats knockwurst and washes it down with beer. And he eats head cheese, which is basically these big chunks of fat in gelatin made into a loaf. It's like eating solid fat. And he's a skinny guy. My cholesterol is good. Every time I go to the doctor, he swoons in ecstasy over my blood pressure. I've got some incredible blood pressure. When I was a kid, I'd pass out sometimes, because I'd get real slow. The blood, you know. But when you get older, that's good.' Walken tossed vegetables, added dill and juiced a lemon into the pan, picking out the seeds afterwards. He immersed dry pasta in boiling water. 'At one point I had a pasta machine. I tried that. They make it look easy. But it's not. Making your own pasta is not easy. 'Now I could put some olives here. You like olives? I put some lemon juice in there, too. 'When I was a kid, every day in the house there was cake, cookies, chocolate cream pies. Every week, the cleaning lady would take home a huge bag of stuff. You'd think it'd be great. In the bakery, I used to make these big vats of melted chocolate. The smell of sugar in that quantity is overwhelming. It's almost too much. 'Now, I never eat dessert. I eat sweets very rarely. I don't eat sugar. In the morning, when I have coffee, I put molasses in it. It's very good. When I go to a restaurant, people always have dessert, and I always skip it. I might have some cheese or something like that.' Walken poured the saut\u00e9ed vegetables into a bowl and put them aside, then tasted the pasta, which was not yet done. He reached into the refrigerator and emerged with a white-paper-wrapped package, which he began to unwrap. 'On pasta, they say 12 minutes,' he said, 'but I always try to keep an eye on it. This is salmon from Citarella. There's one right down the street. I was just working in Nova Scotia and Halifax. You get the most incredible fish there. Mussels that don't really taste like mussels you ever had before. The salmon, it's unbelievable. Chilean sea bass, you know you don't get it a lot here, but when I go to California, they have it all the time. It's such a gorgeous thing. You get a great big chunk of it and you bake it. It's just fabulous. In California they have all these great things like abalone [shellfish]. It's fabulous. But it's very expensive. 'For me, cooking is something that I do when I'm studying scripts. I put the script on the counter and I cook and study my lines at the same time. It's the power of distraction, I find. I've read that a lot of people do one thing while there's something that they're doing at the same time. Some people play cards or garden. I cook. My wife doesn't cook. That's actually common. I think more men cook than women cook.' Walken laid the salmon on the counter and began cutting into it. 'I don't cut through the skin,' he said. 'I just score it in portion sizes and leave the skin hanging off. 'You need to watch your weight in the movie business. It's just a practical thing. Actors are always on some sort of diet. There's a lot of sitting around on movie sets and actors are always sitting on their chairs and talking about food. It may be because they're on a diet and thinking about it a lot. It's true that the camera is very cruel. It makes you look heavier than you are. And movie food is generally very good, because they have to make sure the technicians are happy. They like a nice big lunch with dessert. It's tempting. You've got to watch yourself. 'Buffets are very dangerous. A lot of actors I know gain 15 pounds when they make a movie. I was in a movie once - I don't want to say which - that took eight months to make. Movies are not shot in sequence, so you could watch it and see the people in the movie getting bigger and smaller. Sometimes I go to these movie events, and there'll be a buffet with very good food. You'll see all these important, wealthy people standing on line getting huge plates of it. They don't need it. But psychologically, I guess it's some primitive thing. Somebody's got to eat it. 'I try to keep the icebox fairly empty, and just buy things as I want them. I only eat once a day. Usually about seven o'clock. If I have things to do, eating slows me down. I feel like I'm underwater.' Walken left the fish for a moment, and ripped open a paper-wrapped jar, the dark, gelatinous contents of which he spooned into a mixing bowl. 'That's chutney, and I'm going to put a big thing of it in there. And I have some garlic that's already chopped. And sea salt. I'm going to put a little lemon in there and mix it up. I have some coriander here. People don't use coriander much, but it's really good. 'I eat slowly. It takes me a long time. I usually watch TV, just flip around and find these great movies that I didn't know even existed. That's the best thing about that cable. I just saw an incredible musical with a lot of black performers called Stormy Weather. The last 20 minutes of that are as good as any musical I ever saw. Then I fall right asleep. 'I don't go out to eat much. Occasionally I go to these very fancy restaurants on an anniversary or a birthday or something. I don't want to name any names, but I haven't really been knocked out in the last few years. In the old days - this is 20 years ago - I used to take my wife to Lut\u00e8ce [an old established restaurant on the Upper Eastside] on her anniversary or birthday. That used to be wonderful. It probably still is. But I went to one of the big ones recently. The bill was unbelievable. For three people it was like 300 bucks apiece. I had duck or something like that. Anyway, it was good. But I make a tremendous duck. You have to steam a duck first. I don't think many people do that. This amazing amount of fat comes off. Then you put it on a rack. You stuff it with garlic and oranges, you know, salt, pepper, some herb, whatever that might be. And you put it on the rack and roast it, and it comes out really crispy. I got that from the Julia Child Cookbook. Her cookbooks are wonderful, Julia Child.' After tossing the linguini into a colander, Walken brought the chutney sauce over to the salmon fillet and began massaging the sauce into the fish. 'Oh, incidentally,' he said, 'my hands may look dirty, but that's paint on them. I was painting. I'm going to take this sauce and put this on the top. You scored it, so it kind of gets down into the holes. 'I love Mexican cooking. It's so much more than people know. Here it's, you know, guacamole and enchiladas. I like eating spaghetti. I could eat it every day and I have to watch that. I like French food but sometimes it's very rich. I was in Japan once, and I said to the people I was with, you know, \"I love Japanese food, so I would like to have some real authentic Japanese food\". And they took me to this restaurant and gave me a bowl of what looked like some pasta. I looked at it. There were all these little eyes, and the whole thing was moving. I think they were little white eels. I did have some of it to be polite. That was tough. I had to take it down with some beer.' Walken carried the fish over to where a baking tray is arrayed with a bed of onions, and slapped the fish, sauce-side down, onto the onions. 'All right now,' he said. 'I have this pan with all these onions I did. I saut\u00e9ed them a little bit. 'During movies, I bring my own food. I have various Tupperware containers. And every time I go away for any extended time, I'll stay in an apartment or a hotel that has a kitchen. When I was a kid, I was in musicals, and there'd be the dancers, you know, these crazy gypsies. They'd show up in the little hotel with a suitcase, open it up, and it had every kind of cooking utensil. They would cook these incredible dinners from nothing. Thanksgiving would come and they'd cook this huge turkey in the room. I don't know how they did it.' Walken popped the salmon into the oven. 'It's on broil,' he said. 'I don't time it. You can sort of tell by touching it. 'I've had to stay in places where there only was a microwave. It's not recommended, but you can actually cook certain fish in a microwave. Salmon you can cook practically anywhere. And if you're living like a hobo in a hotel room, you can make amazing things in crockpots. You can stick a chicken in there with some vegetables. Turn it on real low and just leave it there all day. And when you come back it's fabulous.' Walken pulled out a package of jumbo prawns from the refrigerator and, grasping them in his hands, cut through them with the butcher knife, then ran them under water. 'This is a little dangerous,' he said. 'You know you're never supposed to cut like this. You can cut your hand off. You see, you butterfly it. And then there's this vein in there. You want to get rid of that. It's guts, I guess. You want to get those nice and clean. 'I almost did a cooking show. I went to Bravo and MTV and the Comedy Channel. I had meetings with these people and I was going to do this show. It was either 10 or 12 segments. I can't remember. I was going to have some sort of kitchen set-up. I wanted it to be a little like Pee-wee's Playhouse. I love that show. And I'd have maybe a showgirl, you know, with a little thing on, chopping my vegetables. Maybe some musicians. And an audience. Some people to talk to.' Walken laid the prawns into a sizzling frying pan, in which he had saut\u00e9ed some chopped garlic in olive oil. He squeezed an orange into a coffee mug that read 'Notre Dame High School, 25th Class Reunion, Class of 1967'. 'I'm going to throw a little more garlic in there,' he said. 'You want a little more coriander in the shrimp. You put them in shell down in the hot oil - but the next part is a little tricky, some say dangerous. What I've got here is some rum, and I'm squeezing a little bit of orange juice in the rum. You got to wait until these shrimps get a little white. These are big, so they're taking a while. 'I remember Dean Martin's old shows, when he had the Gold Diggers. It was a fabulous show. They say they had the whole thing set up and he'd get in his car and drive from his house, park the car, walk into the studio and do it completely off the cuff. You'd watch it and you could tell that he didn't really know what was going on. And every time things got a little rough, these showgirls called the Gold Diggers - these gorgeous girls - would come on and do this dance number. That's sort of what I had in mind.' Satisfied the prawns were sufficiently opaque, Walken grabbed the rum, turned the burner up and tossed the rum into the pan, then quickly covered it with a lid. It sizzled loudly. 'This top isn't quite tight enough, but it works,' he said. 'It's like a big sudden steam bath. 'With the cable, the thing was, when it got down to it, every one of them wanted something much more precise. They wanted it to be much more planned. Much more of a pragmatic, fabricated thing that could be repeated. They wanted to have a comic actor with me. They wanted to have a script. Jokes. I like jokes. But I wouldn't want to have to say the jokes, you know. Because certain times things are funny anyway. I mean, funny people are funny. And I said to them I wouldn't be able to do that. I wanted it to be like the Dean Martin show.' The meal was done. Walken tossed the vegetables and pasta together, pulled out some small wine glasses, a couple of plates and a half bottle of 1998 Corvo, a white Italian table wine. He carried a canister of sour cream over to the table for the pasta. 'I usually put some sour cream on that,' he said. 'It's up to you. I'll tell you a really simple thing if you're going to have people over. It's expensive, but you get a thing of caviar - you can use the red caviar. But one of the best things in the world is linguine, a big thing of sour cream in the middle and a big scoop of caviar. With some pepper. It's like the best. Anybody can make it. Piece of bread? It's nice bread. Just a little corner? I'll get you a napkin. I'm gonna give you food. I'm not going to eat today. I'll eat later.' Afterwards Walken washed the dishes. He cleaned the sink with a sponge. He put the leftovers in Tupperware. Then he tossed a few paper towels on the ground and wiped the floor by skating around on top of the towel with a stockinged foot. 'Coriander is very hard to clean,' he said. 'All these little green things. 'If I wasn't so lazy, I'll tell you what I would do. I saw this thing on television. This whole thing with people putting cameras in their house, for the net. I understand that people outfit their houses with these things, and some guy's girlfriend finds out that she's been naked all over the Internet. You hear about that. If everybody can do it, it can't be that hard. You just need to figure out where to tune in, right? I would need some help with this. I don't quite understand how the Internet works. I don't have a computer. You know, 12-year-old kids know all about that. 'I thought I'd get a couple of those cameras and put them in my kitchen in Connecticut and just, you know, turn them on whenever I felt like it. Maybe I would have a particular time of day I would do it, or something like that. You could charge people to take hits, or something like that. And it would just be me cooking. And I thought to make it amusing, I thought I would have a hotline - you know, a red telephone. And they could call and I could give them advice about their love life. I mean silly stuff, personal questions, about them, you know, \"What should I do?\" In the old days, there used to be these things - I can't remember what they're called, but it's a Spanish word. Like a bodega, but something else. They'd be on street corners. You could buy a love potion. You could buy, you know, something, if you were mad at somebody, you could buy a hex. They even had aerosol, I remember - you could spray somebody to get them to fall in love with you or something. I could provide services like that. Or just talk while I'm cooking.' Walken sat down at the kitchen table. 'And you remember a programme called This Is Your Life? I thought I'd have a curtain over to one side and once in a while I'd have a mystery guest. You know, actors are always coming over to my house. Maybe Joe Pesci comes over and makes his tomato sauce. Everybody makes something, you know what I mean. Don't you think that might be amusing? 'Or I could do restaurant reviews. Like Ruth Reichl, I could walk in with a big disguise. Like a great big wig. Like everybody would know, they'd be like, \"Oh, here comes Chris with a big wig. Who's he kidding with those big dark glasses?\" Or I could dress up like a woman. Get dressed up with a big fur coat, and I could pretend it's not me.' Christopher Walken said he would eat later. Christopher Walken's TNT Prawn Appetizer Serves four 1 cup dark rum juice of 1 orange 4 jumbo prawn, fresh, with shells left on salt and pepper 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped 2 tablespoons olive oil Combine the rum and orange juice. Leaving the shell on, butterfly the prawns by slicing them with a sharp knife, cutting from back to legs, so that they lie flat, shell-side down, and the two halves approximate the shape of a heart. Wash and gut them under cold water. Salt and pepper the prawns liberally. In a skillet over medium heat, brown the garlic. Arrange the prawns in the pan, shell-side down, and saut\u00e9 for about four minutes, or until most of the body has become opaque. Turn the heat to high. When the skillet begins to sizzle, add the rum and orange juice mixture and immediately slam a tight cover on the skillet, pressing down firmly so that very little steam can escape. Keep the cover pressed down for about 3 minutes. Remove from heat, and uncover. The prawns should look fat, blackened and engorged. Serve from the pan, shell-side down, covering the prawns with the remaining rum sauce. Christopher Walken's Courgette Linguine Serves four 3 cloves garlic, minced 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil 1 onion, diced 2 red bell peppers, diced 2 courgette, cut into 1/2-inch half-wheels 2 summer squash, cut similarly salt and pepper 1/2 cup fresh dill, chopped 10 large kalamata olives, sliced (optional) juice of 1 lemon 450g linguine (Walken uses De Cecco) 4 tbsp sour cream Lightly brown the garlic in the olive oil in a large skillet, on medium heat. Add the onion and red peppers, and saut\u00e9 until soft. Add the courgettes and summer squash, and saut\u00e9 until soft but not wilted. Salt and pepper to taste. Finally, add the dill, lemon juice and olives. Toss together and remove from heat. Toss the mixture with al dente linguine. Garnish with sour cream. Christopher Walken's New Delhi Salmon Serves four 750g fresh salmon fillet, skin left on 2 tbsp olive oil 1 tbsp sea salt 1 onion, chopped into 1/2-inch segments 1 jar chutney (Walken used Major Grey's, you could substitute a mild mango) 3 cloves garlic, finely chopped 1/2 cup fresh coriander, chopped juice of one lemon Preheat the grill. With a sharp knife, cut the salmon fillet crosswise into four portions, but do not break the salmon skin. Rub about two tablespoons of olive oil on the scored piece of salmon and into its crevices, then rub in about a tablespoon of sea salt. Put aside. In a saucepan, lightly brown the onion slices. Pile the browned onion onto greaseproof paper or Pyrex plate, forming a bed of onions with the approximate area as the salmon fillet. In a small mixing bowl, combine the chutney, garlic, coriander and lemon juice. Massage this mixture onto the top of the salmon fillet, making sure that some sauce falls into the crevices. Then take the salmon fillet and slam it down on top of the onion bed, so that the skin is facing up and the sauce side is down. Place the pan under a medium grill for about 20 minutes, or until the skin is burnt and the middle of the fillet is hot to the touch and dark pink. Remove the skin and serve from the pan, sauce- and-onion-side down. \u00a9 Andrew Goldman",

      "body": "<p>Around the age of 20, I started reading the Bible and found in the brutal prose of the Old Testament, in the feel of its words and its imagery, an endless source of inspiration, especially in the series of love songs/poems known as the Psalms. I found the Psalms, which deal directly with the relationship between man and God, teeming with all the clamorous desperation, longing, exaltation, erotic violence and brutality that I could hope for. They are soaked in saudade, drenched in duende, and bathed in bloody-minded violence. In a lot of ways, these songs became the blueprint for many of my more sadistic love songs. Psalm 137, a particular favourite of mine, which was turned into a chart hit by the fab Boney M, is a perfect example of this.</p> <p><strong>Psalm 137</strong></p> <p>By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea,<br> We wept, when we remembered Zion<br> We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof<br> For there they that carried us away captive required<br> Of us a song; and they that wasted us required of us <br> Mirth saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion.<br> How shall we sing the Lord's Song in a strange land<br> If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, Let my right hand<br> Forget her cunning<br> If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to <br> The roof of my mouth: If I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy<br> Remember, O Lord, the children of Edom in the <br> Day of Jerusalem; who said Rase it, rase it, even to<br> The foundation thereof<br> Daughter of Babylon, who are to be destroyed;<br> Happy shall he be, that rewardeth thee as thou hast <br> Served us.<br> Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little <br> Ones against the stones.<br></p> <p>Here, the poet finds himself captive in \"a strange land\", and is forced to sing a song of Zion. He declares his love to his homeland and dreams of revenge. The psalm is ghastly in its violent sentiments, as he sings to his God for deliverance, and that he may be made happy by murdering the children of his enemies. What I found, time and time again in the Bible, was that verses of rapture, of ecstasy and love could hold within them apparently opposite sentiments - hate, revenge, bloody-mindedness - that were not mutually exclusive. This has left an enduring impression upon my songwriting.</p> <p>The love song must be borne into the realm of the irrational, the absurd, the distracted, the melancholic, the obsessive and the insane, for it is the clamour of love itself, and love is, of course, a form of madness. Whether it is the love of God, or romantic erotic love, these are manifestations of our need to be torn away from the rational, to take leave of our senses, so to speak. Love songs come in many forms and are written as declarations of love or revenge, to praise or to wound or to flatter - I have written songs for all these reasons, but ultimately the love song exists to fill with language the silence between ourselves and God, to decrease the distance between the temporal and the divine.</p> <p>But within the world of pop music, a world that deals ostensibly with the love song, true sorrow is just not welcome. There are exceptions: occasionally, a song comes along that hides behind its disposable plastic beat a love lyric of truly devastating proportions. Better The Devil You Know, written by Stock, Aitken and Waterman and sung by Kylie Minogue, is such a song. The disguising of the terror of love in a piece of mindless, innocuous pop is an intriguing concept. Better The Devil You Know contains one of pop music's most violent and distressing love lyrics.</p> <p><strong>Better the Devil You Know</strong></p> <p>Say you won't leave me no more<br> I'll take you back again<br> No more excuses, no, no<br> 'Cause I've heard them all before <br> A hundred times or more<br> I'll forgive and forget<br> If you say you'll never go<br> 'Cause it's true what they say<br> Better the devil you know<br> <br> Our love wasn't perfect<br> I know, I think I know the score<br> You say you love me, O boy<br> I can't ask for more<br> I'll come if you should call<br> I'll be here every day<br> Waiting for your love to show<br> 'Cause it's true what they say<br> It's better the devil you know<br> <br> I'll take you back<br> I'll take you back again<br></p> <p>When Kylie sings these words, there is an innocence to her voice that makes the horror of the chilling lyric all the more compelling. The idea presented within this song, dark and sinister and sad, that love relationships are by nature abusive, and that this abuse, be it physical or psychological, is welcomed and encouraged, shows how even the most seemingly harmless of love songs has the potential to hide terrible human truths. Like Prometheus chained to his rock, the eagle eating his liver night after night, Kylie becomes Love's sacrificial lamb, bleating an earnest invitation to the drooling, ravenous wolf to devour her time and time again, all to a groovy techno beat. \"I'll take you back, I'll take you back again.\" Indeed, here the love song becomes a vehicle for a harrowing portrait of humanity, not dissimilar to the Old Testament psalms. Both are messages to God that cry out into the yawning void, in anguish and self-loathing, for deliverance.</p> <p>As I said earlier, my artistic life has centred around the desire or, more accurately, need to articulate the feelings of loss and longing that have whistled through my bones and hummed in my blood. In the process, I have written about 200 songs, the bulk of which are love songs. Love songs, and thereafter, by my definition, sad songs. A handful of them rise above the others as true examples of all I have talked about. </p> <p>Sad Waters, Black Hair, I Let Love In, Deanna, From Her To Eternity, Nobody's Baby Now, Into My Arms, Lime Tree Arbour, Lucy, Straight To You, I am proud of these songs. Mostly, they were the offspring of complicated pregnancies and difficult and painful births. Most are rooted in direct personal experience and were conceived for a variety of reasons, but this rag-tag group of love songs are, at the death, all the same thing - lifelines thrown into the galaxies by a drowning man.</p> <p>The reasons I feel compelled to write love songs are legion. Some of these became clearer to me when I sat down with a friend of mine. We admitted to each other that we both suffered from the psychological disorder that the medical profession terms \"Erotigraphomania\". </p> <p>Erotigraphomania is the obsessive desire to write love letters. He shared with me the fact that he had written, and sent, over the past five years more than 7,000 love letters to his wife. My friend looked exhausted, and his shame was almost palpable. We discussed the power of the love letter, and found that it was, not surprisingly, very similar to that of the love song. Both serve as extended meditations on one's beloved. Both serve to shorten the distance between the writer and the recipient. Both hold within them a permanence and power that the spoken word does not. Both are erotic exercises in themselves. Both have the potential to reinvent, through words, like Pygmalion with his self-created lover of stone, one's beloved. But more than that, both have the insidious power to imprison one's beloved, to bind their hands with love-lines, gag them, blind them, for words become the defining parameter that keeps the image of the loved one imprisoned in a bondage of poetry. \"I have taken possession of you,\" the love letter, the love song, whispers, for ever.</p> <p> These stolen souls we set adrift, like lost astronauts floating for eternity through the stratospheres of the divine. Me, I never trust a woman who writes letters, because I know that I, myself, cannot be trusted. Words endure, flesh does not. The poet will always have the upper hand. Me, I'm a soul-catcher for God. Here I come with my butterfly net of words. Here I catch the chrysalis. Here I blow life into bodies, and hurl them fluttering to the stars and the care of God.</p> <p>I'd like to look finally at a song I wrote for The Boatman's Call album. It is called Far From Me.</p> <p><strong>Far From Me</strong></p> <p>For you, dear, I was born<br> For you I was raised up<br> For you I've lived and for you I will die<br> For you I am dying now<br> You were my mad little lover<br> In a world where everybody fucks everybody else over.<br> You who are so<br> Far from me<br> So far from me<br> Way across some cold neurotic sea<br> Far from me<br> I would talk to you of all manner of things<br> With a smile you would reply<br> Then the sun would leave your pretty face<br> And you'd retreat from the front of your eyes<br> I keep hearing that you're doing your best<br> I hope your heart beats happy in your infant breast<br> You are so far from me<br> Far from me<br> Far from me<br> <br> There is no knowledge but I know it<br> There's nothing to learn from that vacant voice That sails to me across the line<br> From the ridiculous to the sublime<br> It's good to hear you're doing so well But really, can't you find somebody else <br> that you can ring and tell?<br> Did you ever care for me?<br> Were you ever there for me?<br> So far from me<br> <br> You told me you'd stick by me<br> Through the thick and through the thin<br> Those were your very words<br> My fair-weather friend<br> You were my brave-hearted lover<br> At the first taste of trouble went running back to mother<br> So far from me<br> Far from me<br> Suspended in your bleak and fishless sea<br> Far from me<br> Far from me<br></p> <p>Far From Me took four months to write, the duration of the relationship it describes. The first verse was written in the first week of the affair, and is full of the heroic dreams of the new love, describing the totality of feeling while acknowledging its parallel pain - \"for you I'm dying now\". It sets the two lover-heroes against an uncaring world - \"a world where everybody fucks everybody else over\" - and brings in the notion of physical distance suggested in the title. Verse One, and all is well in the garden. But Far From Me had its own agenda, and was not about to allow itself to be told what to do. As if awaiting the inevitable \"traumatic experience\", it refused to let itself be completed until the catastrophe had occurred. Some songs are tricky like that, and it is wise to keep your wits about you when dealing with them. More often than not, the songs I write seem to know more about what's going on in my life than I do. I have pages and pages of final verses for this song, written while the relationship was still sailing happily along. One such verse went: \"The Camellia, the Magnolia/ Have such a pretty flower/ And the bell from St Mary's/ Informs us of the hour.\" Pretty words, innocent words, unaware that any day the bottom was about to drop out of the whole thing. As I wrote the final verse, it became clear that my life was being dictated by the largely destructive ordinance of the song itself, that it had its own in-built destiny over which I had no control. In fact, I was an afterthought, a bit player in its sly, mischievous and finally malicious vision of how the world should be.</p> <p>Love songs that attach themselves to actual experience, that are a poeticising of real events, have a beauty unto themselves. They stay alive in the same way memories do and, being alive, they grow up and undergo changes and develop. If a song is too weak to do that, if it is lacking in sufficient stamina and the will to endure, sadly, it will not survive. You'll come home one day and find it dead in the bottom of its cage. Its soul will have been reclaimed and all that will remain is a pile of useless words. A love song such as Far From Me demanded a personality beyond the one I originally gave it, with the power to influence my own feelings and thoughts around the actual event itself. The songs that I have written that deal with past relationships have become the relationships themselves, heroically mutating with time and mythologising the ordinary events of my life, lifting them from the temporal plane and blasting them way into the stars. As the relationship itself collapses, whimpering with exhaustion, the song breaks free of it and beats its wings heavenward. Such is the singular beauty of songwriting. Twenty years of songwriting have now passed, and still the void gapes wide. Still the inexplicable sadness, the duende, the saudade, the divine discontent, persists, and perhaps it will continue until I see the face of God himself. But when Moses desired to see the face of God, he was answered that he may not endure it, that no man could see the face of God and live. Well, me, I don't mind. I'm happy to be sad. For the residue cast off in this search, the songs themselves, my crooked brood of sad-eyed children, rally round and in their way protect me, comfort me and keep me alive. They are the companions of the soul that lead it into exile, that sate the overpowering yearning for that which is not of this world. The imagination demands an alternative world, and through the writing of the love song one sits and dines with loss and longing, madness and melancholy, ecstasy, magic and joy with equal measure of respect and gratitude.</p> <p>This is an edited extract from The Complete Lyrics 1978-2001, by Nick Cave, published next Thursday by Penguin at \u00a39.99.<a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000514543,00.html\">Buy it at a discount at BOL</a><br></p> <p>His novel, And The Ass Saw The Angel, was recently re-released at \u00a35.99. <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000510987,00.html\">Buy it at a discount at BOL</a><br></p> <p>Nick Cave Collection \u00a9 Mute Song Ltd 2001.

      "bodyText": "Around the age of 20, I started reading the Bible and found in the brutal prose of the Old Testament, in the feel of its words and its imagery, an endless source of inspiration, especially in the series of love songs/poems known as the Psalms. I found the Psalms, which deal directly with the relationship between man and God, teeming with all the clamorous desperation, longing, exaltation, erotic violence and brutality that I could hope for. They are soaked in saudade, drenched in duende, and bathed in bloody-minded violence. In a lot of ways, these songs became the blueprint for many of my more sadistic love songs. Psalm 137, a particular favourite of mine, which was turned into a chart hit by the fab Boney M, is a perfect example of this. Psalm 137 By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, We wept, when we remembered Zion We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof For there they that carried us away captive required Of us a song; and they that wasted us required of us Mirth saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion. How shall we sing the Lord's Song in a strange land If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, Let my right hand Forget her cunning If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to The roof of my mouth: If I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy Remember, O Lord, the children of Edom in the Day of Jerusalem; who said Rase it, rase it, even to The foundation thereof Daughter of Babylon, who are to be destroyed; Happy shall he be, that rewardeth thee as thou hast Served us. Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little Ones against the stones. Here, the poet finds himself captive in \"a strange land\", and is forced to sing a song of Zion. He declares his love to his homeland and dreams of revenge. The psalm is ghastly in its violent sentiments, as he sings to his God for deliverance, and that he may be made happy by murdering the children of his enemies. What I found, time and time again in the Bible, was that verses of rapture, of ecstasy and love could hold within them apparently opposite sentiments - hate, revenge, bloody-mindedness - that were not mutually exclusive. This has left an enduring impression upon my songwriting. The love song must be borne into the realm of the irrational, the absurd, the distracted, the melancholic, the obsessive and the insane, for it is the clamour of love itself, and love is, of course, a form of madness. Whether it is the love of God, or romantic erotic love, these are manifestations of our need to be torn away from the rational, to take leave of our senses, so to speak. Love songs come in many forms and are written as declarations of love or revenge, to praise or to wound or to flatter - I have written songs for all these reasons, but ultimately the love song exists to fill with language the silence between ourselves and God, to decrease the distance between the temporal and the divine. But within the world of pop music, a world that deals ostensibly with the love song, true sorrow is just not welcome. There are exceptions: occasionally, a song comes along that hides behind its disposable plastic beat a love lyric of truly devastating proportions. Better The Devil You Know, written by Stock, Aitken and Waterman and sung by Kylie Minogue, is such a song. The disguising of the terror of love in a piece of mindless, innocuous pop is an intriguing concept. Better The Devil You Know contains one of pop music's most violent and distressing love lyrics. Better the Devil You Know Say you won't leave me no more I'll take you back again No more excuses, no, no 'Cause I've heard them all before A hundred times or more I'll forgive and forget If you say you'll never go 'Cause it's true what they say Better the devil you know Our love wasn't perfect I know, I think I know the score You say you love me, O boy I can't ask for more I'll come if you should call I'll be here every day Waiting for your love to show 'Cause it's true what they say It's better the devil you know I'll take you back I'll take you back again When Kylie sings these words, there is an innocence to her voice that makes the horror of the chilling lyric all the more compelling. The idea presented within this song, dark and sinister and sad, that love relationships are by nature abusive, and that this abuse, be it physical or psychological, is welcomed and encouraged, shows how even the most seemingly harmless of love songs has the potential to hide terrible human truths. Like Prometheus chained to his rock, the eagle eating his liver night after night, Kylie becomes Love's sacrificial lamb, bleating an earnest invitation to the drooling, ravenous wolf to devour her time and time again, all to a groovy techno beat. \"I'll take you back, I'll take you back again.\" Indeed, here the love song becomes a vehicle for a harrowing portrait of humanity, not dissimilar to the Old Testament psalms.

Far From Me For you, dear, I was born For you I was raised up For you I've lived and for you I will die For you I am dying now You were my mad little lover In a world where everybody fucks everybody else over. You who are so Far from me So far from me Way across some cold neurotic sea Far from me I would talk to you of all manner of things With a smile you would reply Then the sun would leave your pretty face And you'd retreat from the front of your eyes I keep hearing that you're doing your best I hope your heart beats happy in your infant breast You are so far from me Far from me Far from me There is no knowledge but I know it There's nothing to learn from that vacant voice That sails to me across the line From the ridiculous to the sublime It's good to hear you're doing so well But really, can't you find somebody else that you can ring and tell? Did you ever care for me? Were you ever there for me? So far from me You told me you'd stick by me Through the thick and through the thin Those were your very words My fair-weather friend You were my brave-hearted lover At the first taste of trouble went running back to mother So far from me Far from me Suspended in your bleak and fishless sea Far from me Far from me Far From Me took four months to write, the duration of the relationship it describes.

So great is the demand for their services that the department has grown to cover country houses and estates, and homes in Wiltshire, Hampshire, Berkshire, Kent and Oxfordshire as well as central London. </p> <p>Those who want to move to the country are particularly keen to have someone do the legwork, says Mr Bailey. \"They don't want to spend every weekend driving all the way to the country to have a look at a house stuck next to a pylon.\" </p> <p>Similarly buyers relocating from overseas or from the other end of the UK, who are unfamiliar with the area, turn to agents for help finding somewhere to live. </p> <p>Buyers' agents pride themselves on their relationships with estate agents and their detailed knowledge of a patch. Very often they'll hear of properties becoming available and sell them before they're even officially on the market, says Tad Zurlinden, chief executive of the <a href=\"http://www.relocationagents.com/\">Association of Relocation Agents</a>, which represents both buyers agents' and their sister operations, relocation companies. </p> <p>Buyers' agents also work for what Mr Bailey calls, \"back burner clients\". These are very wealthy clients who are after a particular sort of property but are in no rush and don't need to sell their home to move. The team will notify the buyer if agents come across a home that meets the buyer's criteria. </p> <p>As he speaks, Mr Bailey is walking around a property first spotted by a client when they drove past. Knight Frank traced its owners and are now in the middle of negotiating a sale. Also on the move is Phil Spencer, a buyers' agent with Garrington and one half of the team that fronts the Channel 4 programme Location, Location, Location. </p> <p>Mr Spencer, who has just viewed some \"very unsuitable\" Limehouse flats for a client, says, time, or lack of it, is what sends many buyers to seek out the services of an agent. </p> <p>Employing a buyers' agent is about having someone on your side with a detailed knowledge of the area and its property values, says Mr Spencer. \"Because we're involved in new business to agents and because we're dealing with purchases every day we get the pick of properties as they come on to the market,\" he says. </p> <p>\"Why would agents want to spend money on advertising and show 20 people around a property when they can call me?\" he asks. </p> <p>As well as a book bulging with impeccable property contacts, the good buyers' agent needs to spend time finding out exactly what their client wants. \"We visit them in their homes to get an idea of what they like and dislike,\" says Mr Spencer. </p> <p>Those embarking on the house-hunting quest are frequently over-optimistic about what kind of property they want. It's the agents' job to let them down gently, says Mr Bailey. </p> <p>\"We might need to say the reason they're having difficulty finding what they want is because it doesn't exist.\" </p> <p>Some people spend three months house hunting before they really know what they want, he says. </p> <p>And when the perfect property is found, it's the agent's job to keep a cool head at the negotiating table. \"I had a client the other day who walked into the place and said she loved it. She was prepared to stump up the asking price,\" explains Mr Spencer, who persuaded her to hold fire and put in a lower offer. </p> <p>Estate agents are very good at reading how much a buyer has fallen in love with a property, says Mr Spencer. A buyers' agent can keep a distance, he explains: \"I'm not emotionally attached to the property so I was able to go to the agent and say, 'my client quite liked it', without giving too much away.\" </p> <p>As well as time, buyers' agents enthusiastically claim that they can nearly always save clients money by negotiating a lower price for the property. The argument goes that the money saved more than covers the agent's fees. </p> <p>Agents usually charge an up-front registration fee of between \u00a3350 and \u00a3500, which signs clients up for three months. Once they have successfully tracked down a property they'll charge anything between 1.5% and 2% of the final purchase price. Usually the registration fee is deducted from the total. </p> <p>Although agents say they save clients money, if they become popular it is likely that sellers will hike up the price of their house to take into account any savings the agent makes. This is certainly the case in America, where buyer's agents are commonplace. </p> <p>Gill O'Sullivan and her husband David have just bought a four-bedroom, two-bathroom house in Pennsylvania after moving to the US. They have agreed to pay $168,500 for the property - the sellers were asking $180,000. </p> <p>The agent negotiated on their behalf but the O'Sullivans did not pay for her services. \"We don't pay a thing up front, the vendor pays her commission. To take account of this we had to build in her $5,000 commission to our offer price. </p> <p>The sellers will end up getting $163,000 for the sale of their house. In this case it was a private sale. We saw it on Sunday and then we took our agent along on Monday to see what she thought and then went back to her office to write the offer up. The agent also took them through a list of house sales in the area in the same price range, \"so we could gauge whether or not the house was overpriced or fair\". </p> <p>Mr Zurlinden says the past three years has seen a marked increase in the number of people using buyers' agents in the UK.

Borrowers were furious and wrote to Jobs &amp; Money in droves, as well as complaining to the <a href=\"http://www.nationwide.co.uk/pcdefault.htm\">Office of Fair Trading </a>and the <a href=\"http://www.obo.org.uk/\">Banking Ombudsman</a>. Base rates have dropped further since then, but the issue remains the same. </p> <p>The Office of Fair Trading says its unfair contracts term unit is currently investigating whether the dual SVR is biased against the consumer. \"We've had some complaints - not a large number - but they are being looked at,\" says a spokesman. </p> <p>The Banking Ombudsman is also dealing with the complaints consumers have made to it and says it is currently reviewing \"a handful\" of cases, although a spokesman stresses that there could be more complaints in the pipeline. </p> <p>\"The process can take any length of time - up to six months - so we cannot really say when a resolution will be reached,\" he says. Unlike the OFT, the Banking Ombudsman can force lenders to make direct compensation payment to customers of up to \u00a3100,000. The spokesman added that in the case of the last issue it investigated, the big banks were generally more willing to change their policy across the board than building socieites, which insisted on reviewing on a case-by-case basis. </p> <p>David Holmes, spokesman for the Yorkshire Building Society says: \"We have a reputation for being straightforward and transparent and we don't do things which will disadvantage some of our customers. That's why existing capped rate mortgages will also be moved automatically onto the new rate.\" </p> <p>Around 30,000 of Yorkshire's 108,000 borrowers will benefit from the SVR cut. The building society also announced that from this summer interest on the SVR will be calculated daily. All customers whose rates are tied to the SVR will have their mortgage payments altered automatically. </p> <p>Yorkshire says this will save a typical borrower with a \u00a390,000 mortgage \u00a3311 a year - that is the difference between paying \u00a36,055 on a rate of 7.09%, with interest calculated annually, and \u00a35,744 on a rate of 6.65% with daily interest calculations. </p> <p>Halifax maintains that it is doing nothing wrong. A spokesman for the bank says that the vast majority of its customers are on special deals, and are already paying 6.5% or less, although he will not admit to the number of people who are left paying more than this: \"It's commercially sensitive,\" he says. </p> <p>The Halifax's stance has also upset the 30,000 homeowners who took out a loan through Halifax Mortgage Services Limited (HMSL), none of whom will see any of the benefit of Haliax's lower SVR tier. </p> <p>Customers complaining were told that HMSL was reversed into a Halifax subsidiary, the former building society Birmingham Midshires, and that no matter the origin of the loan, or the logo on their documents, their mortgage rate is determined by Birmingham Midshires. </p> <p>Nationwide customers were particularly enraged as the lender is a mutual and as such, is supposed to put the interests of its existing members over those of potential new customers. </p> <p>A spokeswoman says: \"People can always change onto the new SVR once their existing special deal has finished.\" </p> <p>Like the Halifax, the building society also points out that customers on special deals are already paying less than the new SVR.</p>",

The spokesman added that in the case of the last issue it investigated, the big banks were generally more willing to change their policy across the board than building socieites, which insisted on reviewing on a case-by-case basis. David Holmes, spokesman for the Yorkshire Building Society says: \"We have a reputation for being straightforward and transparent and we don't do things which will disadvantage some of our customers. That's why existing capped rate mortgages will also be moved automatically onto the new rate.\" Around 30,000 of Yorkshire's 108,000 borrowers will benefit from the SVR cut. The building society also announced that from this summer interest on the SVR will be calculated daily. All customers whose rates are tied to the SVR will have their mortgage payments altered automatically. Yorkshire says this will save a typical borrower with a \u00a390,000 mortgage \u00a3311 a year - that is the difference between paying \u00a36,055 on a rate of 7.09%, with interest calculated annually, and \u00a35,744 on a rate of 6.65% with daily interest calculations. Halifax maintains that it is doing nothing wrong. A spokesman for the bank says that the vast majority of its customers are on special deals, and are already paying 6.5% or less, although he will not admit to the number of people who are left paying more than this: \"It's commercially sensitive,\" he says. The Halifax's stance has also upset the 30,000 homeowners who took out a loan through Halifax Mortgage Services Limited (HMSL), none of whom will see any of the benefit of Haliax's lower SVR tier. Customers complaining were told that HMSL was reversed into a Halifax subsidiary, the former building society Birmingham Midshires, and that no matter the origin of the loan, or the logo on their documents, their mortgage rate is determined by Birmingham Midshires. Nationwide customers were particularly enraged as the lender is a mutual and as such, is supposed to put the interests of its existing members over those of potential new customers. A spokeswoman says: \"People can always change onto the new SVR once their existing special deal has finished.\" Like the Halifax, the building society also points out that customers on special deals are already paying less than the new SVR.",

'There are some things I bought where I look back and say \"I can't believe I bought so much of that\".' It was a dinner with Stephen Browett of fine wine merchants, Farr Vintners, that brought focus to his buying habits. 'Stephen brought along a bottle of 1962 Latour, my birth year, and it was like I'd stumbled into paradise. Ever since, he's been my guide and friend.

'You can read all the books and magazines and maps that you want, but when you go there yourself you begin to understand why things taste the way they do.'

After my family, wine is the biggest passion of my life without question.'</p> <p>Schofield has been collecting wine for seven years. But in that relatively short time, he's managed to amass a collection of more than 2,000 bottles.

      "body": "<p>A whole range of perennials can be used as bedding plants, although we might not normally think of them as such. They make our gardening far more flexible, but we must have some back-up area in which to let them develop. </p> <p>Michaelmas daisies of most kinds can be brought on in seclusion. They contribute nothing to a border in summer, but we shall be grateful to them come the autumn, when we can give the plants a heavy soaking and transfer them to replace earlier performers - annuals, very likely - that have fizzled out. Water them in heavily, and off they'll go. Outdoor chrysanthemums can be treated in exactly the same way. </p> <p>A Michaelmas daisy with a difference is Aster x frikartii 'M\u00f6nch' (0.8m), which flowers non-stop from late July to October. If you take cuttings of its young shoots now and then grow them on in pots, they'll have made flowering plants by late summer and can be moved into the display bed. They team up particularly well with a black-eyed Susan (Rudbeckia fulgida var. deamii or var. sullivantii 'Goldsturm'), which has bright yellow flowers with a black central cone.</p> <p>If you have a stock plant, you can take cuttings from that now, and line them out when they've rooted; or pot them individually. Alternatively, if you have a large stock plant, split and line that out now and transfer it to the bed when the space is vacant. </p> <p>Perennial lobelias are very much to our purpose. If starting from scratch, sow seed now of Lobelia 'Fan Scharlach'. They won't make large plants this season, but can be grown on in the usual way, lifted in the autumn and bedded into a cold frame for the winter, or over-wintered under a greenhouse bench. Their resting state is in the form of leafy rosettes at ground level. Get these moving next spring, split them if large enough (this is also the treatment for established colonies), and grow them on either in pots or in open ground until they are on the point of flowering. They can then be moved to their display sites. </p> <p>Anthemis tinctoria, a cultivar with bright or pale yellow daisies, is one of my favourite perennials for bedding. Young plants are easier to handle than old, and they flower for much longer.

      "bodyText": "A whole range of perennials can be used as bedding plants, although we might not normally think of them as such. They make our gardening far more flexible, but we must have some back-up area in which to let them develop. Michaelmas daisies of most kinds can be brought on in seclusion. They contribute nothing to a border in summer, but we shall be grateful to them come the autumn, when we can give the plants a heavy soaking and transfer them to replace earlier performers - annuals, very likely - that have fizzled out. Water them in heavily, and off they'll go. Outdoor chrysanthemums can be treated in exactly the same way. A Michaelmas daisy with a difference is Aster x frikartii 'M\u00f6nch' (0.8m), which flowers non-stop from late July to October. If you take cuttings of its young shoots now and then grow them on in pots, they'll have made flowering plants by late summer and can be moved into the display bed. They team up particularly well with a black-eyed Susan (Rudbeckia fulgida var. deamii or var. sullivantii 'Goldsturm'), which has bright yellow flowers with a black central cone. If you have a stock plant, you can take cuttings from that now, and line them out when they've rooted; or pot them individually. Alternatively, if you have a large stock plant, split and line that out now and transfer it to the bed when the space is vacant. Perennial lobelias are very much to our purpose. If starting from scratch, sow seed now of Lobelia 'Fan Scharlach'. They won't make large plants this season, but can be grown on in the usual way, lifted in the autumn and bedded into a cold frame for the winter, or over-wintered under a greenhouse bench. Their resting state is in the form of leafy rosettes at ground level. Get these moving next spring, split them if large enough (this is also the treatment for established colonies), and grow them on either in pots or in open ground until they are on the point of flowering. They can then be moved to their display sites. Anthemis tinctoria, a cultivar with bright or pale yellow daisies, is one of my favourite perennials for bedding. Young plants are easier to handle than old, and they flower for much longer. If left in situ, old plants tend to become tall and unwieldy and to go down to mildew, so take basal cuttings from mossy ground-level shoots in winter or very early spring. Grow them on and bed them out in May. They will flower from early July until late autumn at 0.7m. Each plant will have only one stem, needing one cane and a single tie. You'll need to dead-head once during the flowering period. Very rewarding. I love long-spurred aquilegias, but they do have a limited season, finished by late June.

I applied for a job and was told by my prospective employer that it had won government funding to sponsor a candidate and that part of the job would include doing the course. My wages would be partly funded by the Department of Trade and Industry and the rest by the company. Not surprisingly I jumped at it. </p> <p>The company specialised in manufacturing hard-wearing telecoms equipment for outdoor use and I was brought in to design its new range - much of which formed my projects for the MA. </p> <p>At the end of my two-year contract I was released after it was hinted that I had designed myself out of a job, but that was fine. I had an MA and the experience and my employer had a new range of products. I like to think we both gained. </p> <p>Today I am the design studio manager for Adtranz, DaimlerChrysler's train building division in Derby. We design and build rolling stock for railways across the world. Our work tends to divide into vehicles for larger, long distance trains or rolling stock for urban rail systems similar to the London Underground. </p> <p>Over the past few years we have moved over to a platform approach of design and manufacture similar to that adopted by the car industry. </p> <p>While the trains can look very different both on the outside and internally, they now share the same running gear and structure, in the same way Audi and VW cars do. </p> <p>For example, at the moment we are designing rapid transit vehicles that will run in Guangzhou in China, and although they are basically very similar to trains running in London, local conditions demand that they look quite different. The flexibility of a platform-based approach allows us to design and build a prototype train in as little as five weeks and at a significantly reduced risk to the business. All our work is done on computer-based CAD systems and we now present our ideas in virtual reality. I head a team of ten designers and the work is hectic. </p> <p>I actually started work here after my degree in Edinburgh and returned following the MA. I think the most important thing the MA gave me was a better commercial understanding of how design fits into the bigger picture. </p> <p>The days of designers sitting at drawing boards letting others worry about the commercial viability of a project have gone. Today, design is an integral part of the business strategy.</p>",

I applied for a job and was told by my prospective employer that it had won government funding to sponsor a candidate and that part of the job would include doing the course. My wages would be partly funded by the Department of Trade and Industry and the rest by the company. Not surprisingly I jumped at it. The company specialised in manufacturing hard-wearing telecoms equipment for outdoor use and I was brought in to design its new range - much of which formed my projects for the MA. At the end of my two-year contract I was released after it was hinted that I had designed myself out of a job, but that was fine. I had an MA and the experience and my employer had a new range of products. I like to think we both gained. Today I am the design studio manager for Adtranz, DaimlerChrysler's train building division in Derby. We design and build rolling stock for railways across the world. Our work tends to divide into vehicles for larger, long distance trains or rolling stock for urban rail systems similar to the London Underground. Over the past few years we have moved over to a platform approach of design and manufacture similar to that adopted by the car industry. While the trains can look very different both on the outside and internally, they now share the same running gear and structure, in the same way Audi and VW cars do. For example, at the moment we are designing rapid transit vehicles that will run in Guangzhou in China, and although they are basically very similar to trains running in London, local conditions demand that they look quite different. The flexibility of a platform-based approach allows us to design and build a prototype train in as little as five weeks and at a significantly reduced risk to the business. All our work is done on computer-based CAD systems and we now present our ideas in virtual reality. I head a team of ten designers and the work is hectic. I actually started work here after my degree in Edinburgh and returned following the MA. I think the most important thing the MA gave me was a better commercial understanding of how design fits into the bigger picture. The days of designers sitting at drawing boards letting others worry about the commercial viability of a project have gone. Today, design is an integral part of the business strategy.",

I've got news for you: whether your days are spent in negotiations with the Chinese security services or with Tracey on reception (who won't let you in without your security pass), being a diplomat is now essential if you want to progress in any career. </p> <p>And, contrary to the impression given by a certain advert, it's got very little to do with 'spoiling' your colleagues by handing round a certain brand of chocolates. </p> <p>We can all learn a lot from the example of those who've taken the fast track into the diplomatic service. Take Dawn McKen, who's worked for the Foreign Office for the past five-and-a-half years. Now based in London, working in the Maltese and Cypriot policy section, she put her masters degree in Russian to good use when she was posted to Moscow to work as second political secretary at the British Embassy. </p> <p>While there, she managed to secure the release of second world war papers from the archives and defuse an argument between a Russian civilian and a British tourist (which had led to the latter's arrest). She also successfully co-ordinated a visit by the then newly appointed prime minister, Tony Blair - which meant persuading the nervous Russian security services to allow him to hobnob with the Muscovite public on the Metro. </p> <p>What skills does Dawn use in her job? \"Accuracy is vital,\" she explains. \"You need to have good analysis and judgment skills and be able to think through all the angles on a problem. You can't make any decisions in isolation - you always have to see two steps ahead, looking at the broader picture and working out the implications of your idea for everyone involved. Then you have to be able to justify your decisions. You have to know when to consult and when to use your own initiative. You also need to be approachable and friendly, build up a network of contacts and be able to put yourself in someone else's skin.\" </p> <p>Qualities which, Dawn is the first to admit, we all need, whatever arena we work in. According to Rob Yeung, business psychologist and senior consultant at Kiddy &amp; Partners, diplomacy is a key skill in managing office politics, working with colleagues and achieving promotion. </p> <p>It's essential if you're going to a meeting with new clients or dealing with a partner firm. After all, people who don't know you won't be impressed by your track record. They'll take you at face value: the way you act and behave, the words you use. Get it wrong and you won't have time to backtrack. </p> <p>Rob defines workplace diplomacy as \"having tact and sensitivity to the needs of others\". This doesn't mean biting your tongue and saying nothing - you still have to express your own ideas. \"First,\" says Rob, \"you must listen to the ideas of others, then put forward your own case in an assertive but not aggressive manner. When you're trying to argue a case people can get very emotionally involved. Put down someone's idea and they'll feel that you're also putting them down.\" </p> <p>The earlier you learn diplomacy skills, the better. \"Diplomacy becomes more critical the higher up you go,\" says Rob. \"When you reach the top of an organisation and are dealing with shareholders, one wrong phrase could knock millions of pounds off the share price of your company.\" </p> <p>As anyone who has witnessed the ongoing fracas between Robbie Williams and Liam Gallagher will know, charm beats aggression every time. Likewise, being an office diplomat means keeping your Neanderthal tendencies under control. The trick is to plan. </p> <p>\"If you're going into a difficult meeting, set yourself objectives. Try to foresee any problems that might arise - and the difficult people you might encounter - and work out how you'll deal with them calmly and effectively. Then, review your behaviour after the event and ask for feedback. Remember and learn from any negative criticism.\" </p> <p>Rob says it's useful to identify your diplomatic heroes and villains and use them as role models. \"Who is calm, empathetic and inspiring? What do they actually do? Watch their body language, their tone of voice and the types of words they use. Try to adopt these behaviours for yourself. On the other hand, who constantly offends people and puts their foot in their mouth? Do you make any of the same mistakes? If so, you'll need to change your behaviour.\" </p> <p><strong> If you don't remember anything else...</strong></p> <p>Globalisation means diplomacy is now more important than ever. Even those of us who don't work for the Foreign Office now have to deal with, for example, Japanese bankers or American lawyers - each of whom will have very different ways of working. You'll have to learn what's acceptable not only in your own company culture, but also in the cultures of other organisations and nationalities.

The photo on your desk of a recent - although it seems like a lifetime away - holiday is more than just decoration or memory of happy times. It can actually improve your wellbeing and job satisfaction at work, according to a recent study by researchers at Eastern Kentucky University. The researchers found that when office workers were allowed to personalise their space, a greater level of wellbeing was reported. </p> <p>Why? And what does your workspace say about you? Personalising the workspace is a way for people to mark out their territory and is their own identifiable and defensible space. After all how many people would rummage around someone's desk without asking, says Ben Williams, an Edinburgh-based chartered corporate psychologist. </p> <p>Perhaps that's why many of us are so precious about our desks. The US survey of 1,008 office workers found that 85% personalised their workplace and 68% of those who did so said that it improved their overall attitude at work. As to reasons why, 60% said that they liked having their creature comforts around them and 39% said that they wanted people to have a peek at their individuality. </p> <p>And why not, given that in today's workplace, downsizing has led to people feeling insecure at work? By surrounding themselves with personal effects, employees may be trying to create a sense of security and stability. </p> <p>However, there are differences in how men and women view their workspaces. The study at Eastern Kentucky University found that women tend to personalise their workspace more than men and that they tend to use symbols of their family, friends and pets as well as trinkets and plants. </p> <p>On the other hand, men tend to personalise their workspace with symbols of their achievement and sports paraphernalia. </p> <p>Although it's important not to generalise, it's suggested that the reasons for this gender difference could be that on the whole women like to personalise their workspace as a way of expressing their identities and emotions, whereas men personalise to parade their status within the company. </p> <p>Whether it's showing your sensitive side or showing how well you've done, the items used to personalise your workspace say something about you. Projecting an image by what you display on your desk can be deliberate and quite contrived - for example, displaying trophies that you have won in competition tells people that you're not just sporty, but successful as well. </p> <p>\"Photos of big houses and expensive cars are about telling people that you've done well and are wealthy,\" explains Ben. </p> <p> While your sporting trophies or photos of your cat may make you feel better, only around half of office workers surveyed (47%) felt that their employers actually encouraged workers to decorate their workspace and 42% indicated that their company did not encourage this. Some employees reckoned their company viewed it as unprofessional, others were concerned about damage to the walls while some of the offices employees worked in adhered to a strict design code. </p> <p>However, employers should think twice about imposing restrictions on employees who want to stamp their own identity on their workspace. Personalising the workplace gives employees ownership over their working environment. Imposing restrictions can lead to disgruntled employees and dissatisfaction. </p> <p>Employers can have a direct impact on effectiveness in the workplace if they give employees some freedom, not just in the way they work but also in how they personalise their workspace, says Nigel Corlett retired professor of production engineering at Nottingham University. </p> <p>So, if you're feeling stressed out, demoralised or uninspired, having familiar items around which mean a lot to you, can improve your mood and productivity. Most of us are working longer hours and spending more time at work, so having personal effects around the office whether photos of your family or postcards from your friends can help you remember what's important when the going gets tough. </p> <p>Likewise, evidence of achievements or sporting prowess can give you a boost if you're having a bad day or are suffering from a lack of confidence. </p> <p>But a note of caution: even though your workspace may be a reflection of your personality, be aware of how this may affect others and ensure that you don't personalise with items which may offend. </p> <p>Any form of pornography like nude calendars, is a no-no. Similarly, symbols or signs of affiliation to extreme groups is not advisable, explains Ben Williams. Although there are no legal guidelines about what items can and cannot be displayed, it's important that you show sensitivity to your colleagues at work.</p>",

Projecting an image by what you display on your desk can be deliberate and quite contrived - for example, displaying trophies that you have won in competition tells people that you're not just sporty, but successful as well. \"Photos of big houses and expensive cars are about telling people that you've done well and are wealthy,\" explains Ben. While your sporting trophies or photos of your cat may make you feel better, only around half of office workers surveyed (47%) felt that their employers actually encouraged workers to decorate their workspace and 42% indicated that their company did not encourage this. Some employees reckoned their company viewed it as unprofessional, others were concerned about damage to the walls while some of the offices employees worked in adhered to a strict design code. However, employers should think twice about imposing restrictions on employees who want to stamp their own identity on their workspace. Personalising the workplace gives employees ownership over their working environment. Imposing restrictions can lead to disgruntled employees and dissatisfaction. Employers can have a direct impact on effectiveness in the workplace if they give employees some freedom, not just in the way they work but also in how they personalise their workspace, says Nigel Corlett retired professor of production engineering at Nottingham University. So, if you're feeling stressed out, demoralised or uninspired, having familiar items around which mean a lot to you, can improve your mood and productivity. Most of us are working longer hours and spending more time at work, so having personal effects around the office whether photos of your family or postcards from your friends can help you remember what's important when the going gets tough. Likewise, evidence of achievements or sporting prowess can give you a boost if you're having a bad day or are suffering from a lack of confidence. But a note of caution: even though your workspace may be a reflection of your personality, be aware of how this may affect others and ensure that you don't personalise with items which may offend. Any form of pornography like nude calendars, is a no-no. Similarly, symbols or signs of affiliation to extreme groups is not advisable, explains Ben Williams. Although there are no legal guidelines about what items can and cannot be displayed, it's important that you show sensitivity to your colleagues at work.",

But we're so worried Americans won't love us as we are that we set all those romantic comedies in a strange, sanitised place I think of as Londonland, a historical theme park, Cool Britannia meets A Christmas Carol, where only white people live, shops twinkle festively in the dusk, packed restaurants sell delectable food in designer settings, and the snow flurries winsomely around, landing like sequins on people's hair.

So we have as a nation coughed up \u00a31.3m for this slim volume, a pretty incredible sum. He hears from people who have been given up to a dozen copies on their 50th birthday.

      "bodyText": "The government's drug safety watchdogs have ordered an urgent review of the packaging and labelling of medicines in an effort to reduce mistakes which are putting patients' lives at risk. Officials believe that emphasising the differences between types of drug and giving clearer descriptions and instructions are a key factor in reducing errors. They are also drawing up plans to improve training of pharmacists and doctors to ensure prescriptions are properly prepared and to tighten rules on storage and access to medication. The government said medication errors could be cut by 40% within five years although the Department of Health could not say last night on what figures that target was based. Officials said some of the most serious incidents have happened as a result of the wrong drugs being administered, often because very different ones are presented to doctors in almost identical packaging. Lookalike and sound-alike trademarks are also causing concern. The overall standard of prescribing is said to be \"generally high\" but it is inevitable that errors will occur. \"When this happens, patients can be harmed, sometimes seriously,\" said an official document on improving patients' safety. The Medical Defence Union said 25% of all indemnity paid out after litigation claims results from drug mistakes by GPs, who write 1.5m prescriptions daily in England alone. NHS advisers think hospital mistakes, where a further 500,000 prescriptions are written every day, are likely to be even more serious because of the complexity of the treatments. The government is already reviewing the administration of chemotherapy treatments for cancer after the accidental death of Wayne Jowett, who died in a Nottingham hospital in February after an intravenous drug was injected into his spine. But it has now emerged that the review is far wider than previously thought. The committee on safety of medicines, which reports to the medicines control agency, has set up a working group to provide recommendations to ministers on improving packaging by July. The committee's chairman, Professor Alasdair Breckenridge, said it took \"very seriously its role in advising on the information presented in medicines labelling and will play its part in tackling the problem of medication errors by ensuring medicines labelling supports safety in use\". The Association for the British Pharmaceutical Industry said there was no evidence that unclear packaging or labelling was responsible for errors and all products had to be approved by the medicines control agency. Dispensing errors can also have fatal consequences. Recent cases include the death of a patient taking slow-release morphine capsules because the pharmacist provided medication at 10 times the prescribed dose. The development of a national reporting system for medication errors is now under way.",

      "body": "<p>The mood around the cramped lunch table on the fourth floor offices of the Conservative thinktank Politea in Charing Cross Road, central London, was gloomy, and it was not just the cold salmon and mayonnaise. The discussion, involving a high-calibre set of rightwing economists, thinkers and MPs, took a second-term Labour government as its assumed starting point.</p> <p>Therein lies the problem for William Hague. Hardly anyone - not even leading Conservative thinkers - expects to see Mr Hague in Downing Street on June 8.</p> <p>Not even the foot and mouth crisis, in which the Tory leader has clearly performed well, has boosted his poll ratings. This week it again left him exposed to the Westminster parlour game of judging how many seats he needs to save his political skin. He faced the same speculation before the 1998 local elections and the 1999 European elections.</p> <p>But this time the talk of challenges, plots and intrigue is getting louder. Despite efforts to claim the whole thing is pure fiction dreamt up by \"postmodern journalists\" filling an Easter vacuum, Mr Hague's future is once again perilous. A textbook Millbank-inspired operation painting parts of the Tory party as racist only strengthened the image of a leader unwilling or unable to control extremism in his party.</p> <p>The shadow chancellor Michael Portillo's intervention yesterday, in effect rubbishing the idea of a commission for racial equality code of conduct to which Mr Hague has publicly signed up the party, deepened the sense of internal party disarray and opened the way to further Labour accusations of disunity.</p> <p>Mr Portillo stated he had no intention of signing the declaration - not because he disagreed with its aims but because he was \"bedevilled\" with too many such declarations - only a day after publicly volunteering a pledge of loyalty to Mr Hague.</p> <p>Only weeks after the party chairman Michael Ancram wrote to MPs stressing that it would not tolerate racism, the Conservatives have been split into signatories and non-signatories. The damage will reverberate, and with only eight weeks to reclaim ground, this has been seven badly lost days. Not surprisingly Labour plans to exploit the Tory chaos with a mass telephone canvass this weekend.</p> <p>Yet the immediate cause of the latest travails lies in a more individual phone call on February 15. John Stevens, the millionaire leader of the tiny Pro-Euro Conservative party, phoned the former chancellor, Kenneth Clarke. He has always refused to back Mr Stevens' breakaway party, and the two men had not spoken for months.</p> <p>They differ over the detail of the call. Mr Stevens undoubtedly canvassed Mr Clarke to issue a public statement urging him not to stand against Michael Portillo in Kensington and Chelsea. Mr Stevens was facing a split within his own tiny ranks, and privately did not want to put up a lot of candidates, especially against Mr Portillo.</p> <p>Mr Clarke declined the offer, even though he had never favoured the idea of Mr Stevens challenging Mr Portillo, just as he had not supported the breakaway tactic. Mr Stevens had long nourished the hope that the breakaway could provoke a split in the Tory party on Europe. In this he has long been disappointed by Mr Clarke.</p> <p>Mr Stevens still thinks a Tory split is the best way to ensure that the biggest challenge of democratic politics - a euro referendum victory - can be met.</p> <p>The Stevens-Clarke conversation then turned to something less arcane. Mr Clarke expressed a belief that Mr Portillo was shifting ground and having a genuine rethink, now a common observation in the reduced ranks of the Tory left. In Mr Stevens' recollection, Mr Clarke suggested that Mr Portillo, if he won the party leadership, would not demand that his frontbench oppose the euro either in a referendum campaign or, more importantly, in its run-up.</p> <p>Mr Clarke almost certainly did not mean to imply he had swung behind Mr Portillo, let alone a leadership challenge. And if Mr Portillo did remove the frontbench from collective responsibility on the euro, he would be doing something quite extraordinary, betraying his past and risking a confrontation within his party.</p> <p>However, the general thesis that the left is looking again at Mr Portillo and that he is delicately reaching out to them is undeniable. They may need each other, and as the fault lines inside the Tory party evolve, an alliance is more possible. Mr Portillo's social liberalism, and admitted homosexual past, have alienated some but not all Thatcherites. Many, such as John Bercow, have travelled with him on the journey, but his base has narrowed. Some sceptics also fear Mr Portillo may be losing the stomach for the battle over the euro. They worry he will fight the euro in a referendum but, if defeated, accept the result as final.</p> <p>The left, for its part, is a rump in the parliamentary party and is reluctantly discounting Mr Clarke's chances.</p> <p>Figures such as Stephen Dorrell and Damian Green recognise the substance of the Portillo political cum cultural journey. They know he took a huge personal risk when he told his party conference in Bournemouth he was for people \"regardless of sexual orientation\".</p> <p>In the autumn, after months of introspection induced by the inevitable party backlash, Mr Portillo picked himself up and decided to focus on the job of shadow chancellor, working on the details of the Tories' proposed \u00a38m tax cut. He only once more formally genuflected to his new constituency by speaking to a meeting of the centre-left Mainstream group at the Tory spring conference. The speech was innocuous but the symbolism important.</p> <p>But there is no sign that Mr Portillo and his immediate aides are now plotting. He has no personal motive to do so, at this stage.</p> <p><b> Ready to strike</b><br></p> <p>This does not stop others, especially those who fear Mr Portillo will again dither, from preparing to ensure there is a challenge. The key date in the mind of the diverse anti-Hague alliance is June 8. They are determined in the wake of the election not to let Mr Hague's allies move quicker than them. They do not want a repeat of the John Major ploy in 1995 when he got his message out that he had won the vote of confidence. Hagueites will not be allowed to dominate the networks with claims that by gaining 30 to 50 seats, Mr Hague has shown he is credibly one election away from the premiership, or at the very least the man to lead the fight to save the pound in a euro referendum. Names are already being suggested to declare that Mr Hague must go. The potential names are substantial: Chris Patten, Steve Norris, Lord Cranborne, possibly David Davis.</p> <p>Mr Hague potentially faces a strong triumvirate of diverse forces ready to strike against him - social liberals like Stephen Dorrell, Steve Norris, independent rightwingers such as David Davis and Eric Forth, pro-Europeans such as Ian Taylor. From within that nexus, someone will emerge to find the 15% of Tory MPs required to mount a vote of no confidence.</p> <p>For in the short space of his leadership, Mr Hague has made enemies. He has sacked John Redwood, let down Michael Howard, dismissed Lord Cranborne, upended Ann Widdecombe, and infuriated Francis Maude.</p> <p>On June 8 and the feverish days thereafter, everyone will make their own calculation, and it is possible the election result will be clear enough to make the decision for everyone.</p> <p>But Mr Hague's survival will not depend just on the mathematics. It will depend on his performance in the campaign and whether he can produce a strategy to show he can credibly broaden his appeal. He will also need to \"take out\" his potential challengers by offering promotion. It is widely expected that the talented sceptic Iain Duncan Smith will be made foreign secretary. But some Tory MPs believe Mr Hague must, and will, go further. They say he may offer a more conciliatory style, widening his field of advice, shedding some unpopular aides and vowing a return to the more socially inclusive politics of his first two leadership years.</p> <p>It may be too late. As one shadow cab inet member complained recently: \"We seem to have reversed the normal electoral cycle. Instead of starting by resecuring our core support and then broadening the appeal to the centre, we began with a wide appeal and spent the last two years narrowing it.\"</p> <p>The narrowing of the appeal, and the failure to find much distinctive to say on health and education, has lost Mr Hague many natural friends. His often refreshing and thoughtful speeches of the first two years of his leadership were laced with talk of compassion and the need to move on from the economic agenda of the 1980s.</p> <p>He daringly tried to symbolise the conversion in April 1999 by sanctioning his then deputy Peter Lilley to reject Thatcherism and abandon attempts to find private sector solutions to the problems of education and health. It was a clumsy piece of repositioning, made worse by the accompanying spin operation. The Daily Mail trailed the speech as the most spectacular policy switch since the second world war.</p> <p>It was the turning point in the Hague leadership. The backlash led to Mr Lilley's dismissal, and the departure of some innovative but disaffected central office staff, such as Andrew Cooper and Michael Simmonds. A harder edged, less socially liberal group including the MPs Tim Collins and Andrew Lansley grew in influence. They had a less complex view of what the Conservative voter wants and are less hung up on finding \"a bold new social agenda\", a onetime aim of Mr Hague.</p> <p>By the spring of last year, Mr Hague had refashioned himself and was in full flow over bogus asylum seekers. On April 26 he struck a public chord with his defence of Tony Martin, the Norfolk farmer who killed a burglar. Accused of bandwagon politics, the Tory leader argued that there was no point making 12-page speeches on the environment if they were not reported. He would reveal his message and values by intervening on issues of the day.</p> <p>But Mr Hague's critics, including Lord Bell, Margaret Thatcher's advertising guru, believe the pursuit of the headline has led to inconsistency and lack of focus. In a comment that will echo chillingly through Tory ranks, he said: \"They have to define what the brand is and what the benefits of the brand to Britain and the British people are. And that is just what they have not done.\"</p> <p>If enough Tory MPs agree with that verdict come June 8, Mr Hague will be gone.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Taiwan staged a symbolic show of armed force yesterday, repelling a mock Chinese invasion by land, sea and air just days before the US takes the crucial decision whether to sell it advanced weaponry. Fighter jets and attack helicopters armed with US-made missiles attacked targets in the Taiwan Strait as the annual Han Kuang (Chinese glory) manoeuvres involving 3,400 troops began at an acutely sensitive time in Sino-US relations. Early next week US foreign and defence policy chiefs will meet a Taiwanese military delegation in Washington to answer the most urgent international security question since George Bush succeeded Bill Clinton three months ago. Every year, under the vaguely worded 1978 Taiwan Relations Act, Washington is obliged to make an announcement about possible arms sales to Taiwan, the island which China regards as a renegade province and is inexorably becoming the West Berlin of Washington's embryonic new cold war with Beijing. With a conservative Republican back in the White House and Republicans narrowly in control of both houses of Congress, Taiwan has been hoping for a weapons windfall that will bolster its defences and boost its attempt to edge itself back in from the international cold. Well before his election Mr Bush hinted that he was prepared to lend steel to Taiwan's defiance of its more powerful neighbour on the mainland. Now it is crunch time. Analysts on both sides of the Pacific regard next week's decision as the litmus test of the China policy the administration has put at the centre of its strategic vision. It will go a long way towards showing whether Mr Bush is the ideologue he sometimes hints at or the pragmatist that conservatives have always feared him to be. The events surrounding the EP-3 spy plane incident have added spice to the decision. As Republicans return to Washington on Monday from the two-week Easter break they will be looking for proof that the man in the White House is prepared to stand up for Taiwan. But Mr Bush has other considerations. As he repeatedly said during the spy plane crisis, he seeks a \"constructive\" relationship with Beijing. As a free trader he wants American capital to go on flowing into the Chinese market. Any need he feels to face down China on security issues will always be tempered by the desire to keep its markets open to the US companies which finance his party. China has 2.5m people under arms, compared with Taiwan's 400,000; nearly 10 times as many tanks; and, more significantly, more than 30 times the number of fighter planes, although most of them are old. Its navy dwarfs Taiwan's, and the gap is widening all the time. That is why Taiwan went to Washington last year with the longest and costliest armaments shopping list in its history. Most of the weapons President Chen Shui-bian wants are to equip Taiwan's defences against China's increasing naval and missile build-up. At the top of the list are four Arleigh-Burke class destroyers - not yet built - equipped with the Aegis battle management and radar system. They have acquired immense political significance to both China and Taiwan, because they could provide Taiwan with the platform for a regional missile defence system, the Patriot PAC-3, which is also still under development. Aegis can track more than 100 hostile ships, aircraft or missiles at one time and, in theory at least, could give Taiwan the means to resist the 300-odd short-range missiles that comprise China's primary strike weapon. Almost as significant are the eight diesel-powered submarines that Taiwan has repeatedly tried to obtain. German designed but US-built, they - together with the P-3 surveillance planes it also wants - would give Taiwan a powerful edge in the increasingly confrontational waters of the South China Sea. Recent reports in Washington suggest that Mr Bush is looking for a compromise package that would significantly improve Taiwan's defences and satisfy the powerful Taiwan lobby in Congress while stopping short of a rearmament programme that would alarm and humiliate Beijing. Most analysts believe therefore that Mr Bush will deny Taiwan the Aegis-equipped ships and the PAC-3 system. He is tipped to offer Kidd-class destroyers and press ahead with building Aegis-equipped Arleigh-Burkes, giving him a bargaining chip if Beijing concludes that the US has gone back on its ambiguous vows to support Taiwan. If this is what the administration has chosen to do, then there have been other signs this week that Mr Bush is creeping closer towards a more robust de facto recognition of Taiwan. President Chen is likely to get a visa to stop off in the US on his way to Latin America next month, an act that Beijing regards as a breach of the \"one China\" shibboleth. Mr Chen may even be allowed to meet his supporters in Congress, such as the House Republican whip Tom DeLay, a militant friend of Taiwan. That would make China apoplectic. Materially, giving Mr Chen a visa would not be the kind of threat to China that submarines, planes or destroyers present. But the diplomatic snub would be very great.

      "bodyText": "For the first time in decades the contest for the leadership of the Liberal Democratic party, which almost automatically carries with it the premiership of Japan, is too close to predict. As the 2.4m party members vote this weekend in primary elections, a division between the urban young and their elderly country counterparts is undermining the dogged factional loyalty that has kept this political machine together and in power for all but one of the past 46 years. Final voting and results are expected on Tuesday. According to the opinion polls the favourite, the former prime minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, is unlikely to win a clear lead in the first round, so he will be forced to either stand down or to undergo a damaging run-off against his more popular and reform-minded rival Junichiro Koizumi. The outcome is expected to be decided in the second round, when the two weaker candidates, Shizuka Kamei, a former construction minister, and Taro Aso, the economics minister, are expected to drop out of the running. This was not supposed to happen. Mr Hashimoto heads the LDP's Keiseikai faction - the biggest of the parties-within-a-party among whom the spoils of power have traditionally been shared. The Keiseikai is backed by lobbies representing postal workers, war veterans, doctors and the construction industry, which account for 65% of the LDP membership and an even greater share of its funds. No candidate from the Keiseikai has ever failed to win the party presidency. Usually, he receives promises of support from other faction leaders before the election begins, which then becomes a rubber stamp for the decisions of a handful of elderly men in smoke-filled rooms. This time the party gerontocracy appears to be losing its grip. For the first time it faces a mini-rebellion by MPs, as well as an unusually democratic and unpredictable poll of the broader membership, which will decide more than a quarter of the 487 votes. Many of the LDP MPs, who account for 346 votes, are worried that Mr Hashimoto will be little better than the outgoing Yoshiro Mori in terms of popularity. In a poll by the Asahi Shimbun this week, only 12% of voters favoured the outgoing prime minister while 51% thought Mr Koizumi was the best of the four candidates. With an upper house election in July, this consideration has prompted younger members to think the unthinkable. \"I refuse to simply obey faction leaders,\" said Hideaki Omura, a member of the Hashimoto faction from the city of Nagoya. \"It's time that we were given the freedom to decide for ourselves who is the most suitable candidate, based on policies and talent, not just loyalty.\" While few other faction members have been brave enough to make such declarations of independence in public, the degree of discontent was evident at a meeting to formalise Mr Hashimoto's candidacy, which 20 of the group's 101 MPs failed to attend. In the regions, too, the leadership's weakening control over the rank and file has prompted desperate measures. Rather than trust members from the postal lobby to vote according to instruction, party elders have ordered them to hand in blank ballot sheets so that they can be filled in en-masse by loyalists. Such dirty tactics go unpunished because LDP polls are not covered by electoral law. Elsewhere, however, disgruntled regional bosses have made the rare decision to give their members a free vote. This has led to confusion among loyalists who have grown used to doing what they are told.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>British shops and stores suffered a consumer backlash against foot and mouth-induced price rises last month, bringing retail sales growth to an abrupt halt. </p> <p>Sales volumes stagnated in March, according to figures released by the office for national statistics - the weakest performance for nearly a year - and a sharp slowdown from the surging sales recorded in January and February. </p> <p>Food sales rose just 0.1% over the month, to the surprise of City analysts, who had been expecting bumper sales after reports last month that households were stockpiling food. </p> <p>But while the amount consumers bought remained the same, they paid more because of soaring prices. The average value of weekly sales in March was \u00a33.9bn, a 5.8% rise on March 2000. </p> <p>\"Although volume growth has slowed, price increases pushed up the value of retail sales last month,\" an ONS statistician said. </p> <p>\"You don't need to be a Maff vet to diagnose the impact of foot and mouth disease in March's retail sales data,\" said Ross Walker, UK economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland. \"In effect, the higher cash spend was siphoned off into higher prices.\" </p> <p>The so-called retail sales deflator - a measure of inflation on the high street - surged to 1% in the 12 months to March, from 0.2% the previous month, the highest in over two years. Food prices increased by 3.7%, mainly driven by higher meat and seasonal vegetable prices, according to the ONS. </p> <p>This is unlikely to trouble the Bank of England's rate-setting monetary policy committee because the wider measure of retail price inflation released on Thursday showed prices rising at their slowest rate in a year.

      "bodyText": "British shops and stores suffered a consumer backlash against foot and mouth-induced price rises last month, bringing retail sales growth to an abrupt halt. Sales volumes stagnated in March, according to figures released by the office for national statistics - the weakest performance for nearly a year - and a sharp slowdown from the surging sales recorded in January and February. Food sales rose just 0.1% over the month, to the surprise of City analysts, who had been expecting bumper sales after reports last month that households were stockpiling food. But while the amount consumers bought remained the same, they paid more because of soaring prices. The average value of weekly sales in March was \u00a33.9bn, a 5.8% rise on March 2000. \"Although volume growth has slowed, price increases pushed up the value of retail sales last month,\" an ONS statistician said. \"You don't need to be a Maff vet to diagnose the impact of foot and mouth disease in March's retail sales data,\" said Ross Walker, UK economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland. \"In effect, the higher cash spend was siphoned off into higher prices.\" The so-called retail sales deflator - a measure of inflation on the high street - surged to 1% in the 12 months to March, from 0.2% the previous month, the highest in over two years. Food prices increased by 3.7%, mainly driven by higher meat and seasonal vegetable prices, according to the ONS. This is unlikely to trouble the Bank of England's rate-setting monetary policy committee because the wider measure of retail price inflation released on Thursday showed prices rising at their slowest rate in a year. While food stores managed an anaemic 0.1% increase in sales volumes, non-food retailers suffered a 0.4% fall. Chemists and newsagents were hardest hit, with volumes falling by 1.4% over the month. City analysts seized on the figures as giving the green light for further rate cuts. The Bank of England has been scrutinising the retail sales figures for signs that consumers have begun tightening their belts to make room for higher government spending to come. \"This morning's report clearly provided some dovish news for the market, and certainly helps the cause for a May rate cut,\" said George Buckley, UK economist at Deutsche Bank. But other analysts warned it was too soon to declare the consumer boom over. \"The UK consumer is still in good shape and may just have paused for breath in May,\" said Mr Walker. Although the Bank has lowered borrowing costs twice since February, some members of the MPC have been wary about the risk of robust demand reigniting inflation. But the minutes of its latest meeting released this week suggest the MPC has switched focus from the domestic economy to the deteriorating global economic outlook. \u0095 EU finance ministers last night piled pressure on the ECB to join global efforts to ward off recession. \"A rate cut is long overdue,\" said Austrian finance minister Karl-Heinz Grasser, at a meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors. The ECB is the only big central bank not to have cut rates since the global outlook deteriorated. Its next meeting is on Thursday.

      "body": "<b> Patrick Holden, director of the Soil Association</b> <p>\"You cannot define 20 new cases as under control; if we had had that in the early stages we would have been desperately alarmed. It's about half the maximum rate, which means that the outbreak may not be quite as out of control as it was. But if you talk to people on the ground in Devon and Cumbria and south west Scotland, there is still a major problem. </p> <p>\"We all hope it will be brought under control. But I think whether or not the disease is in decline and has reached a point where it can be controlled by slaughter, it doesn't remove the question of whether culling is the best strategy either in the tail end of this outbreak or in a new one. </p> <p>\"If you bring the disease under control by killing all the livestock in the area it's a pyrrhic victory.\" </p> <p> <b> Martin Haworth, director of policy, National Farmers' Union</b> </p> <p> \"We're certainly not going to use the phrase 'under control' because it's capable of misinterpretation. It's under control in the sense that all the evidence is that the outbreak has hit its peak and is on the way down, but we will not accept we have defeated the disease until we have seen the last case. </p> <p>\"Complacency would be a danger. The mechanisms in place are having an effect, but if people think it's been defeated when it hasn't and become lax and start moving animals against the rules, or not being so assiduous with disinfecting themselves or vehicles, there's the risk of a new outbreak in an area where we haven't had one so far. That would be a disaster.\" </p> <p> <b> Harold Armstrong, farmer, Bromfield, Cumbria</b> </p> <p> \"Around here we're on target, slaughtering animals within 10 days of reporting the infection, but that doesn't mean it's under control. Nationally the number of farms infected is falling, but the percentage of cases in some areas like Cumbria is rising. </p> <p>\"From here, I can see 12 farms around me that have been infected, and only four that are left. Two-thirds of farms have been infected, and those that are left are on their own, so if they're saying the number is falling, that's because there aren't many farms left.\" </p> <p> <b> Peter Vasey, pedigree cattle breeder, Cumbria</b> </p> <p> \"There do seem to be less cases, but there's also less cattle left to infect in Cumbria. There's a good chance the worst is over, but farmers have suffered badly.\" </p> <p> <b> Paul Ashley, north-west representative for Farmers for Action</b> </p> <p> \"There are smaller numbers of reported cases at the moment, and we are improving the immediate cull. If you look at what was happening at the start of the outbreak, after each reported case there would be an outbreak on a neighbouring farm 10 to 12 days later. Now they are removing the infected animals almost within 24 hours. It is improving. </p> <p>\"If Maff and the army can get on top of the disposal of carcasses, then maybe the timing goals will be achieved and if that happens then we will see a significant reduction in the number of cases.\" </p> <p> <b> Lieutenant-Colonel Barry Hawgood, spokesman for the army's operation in Cumbria</b> </p> <p> \"It's a very dangerous thing to say that the epidemic is now under control. We're confident that we are in control of the situation as it is now, but if we have a flare-up, a new outbreak that we didn't anticipate, it could lead our resources to a level we don't wish to use. We have 250 personnel deployed in Cumbria, and we are capable of culling and clearance under present conditions.\" </p> <p> <b> Professor Mark Woolhouse, veterinary epidemiologist, University of Edinburgh</b> </p> <p> \"If the rate at which each outbreak is generating new outbreaks is greater than one, you are in a period of increase. That was the basis on which we reported the epidemic was out of control. By our estimation it has fallen below one and if it stays there the epidemic is in a declining phase. As long as control measures are maintained, the rate should remain below one. I hope the report will encourage those on the ground that their efforts are working and they should continue with them, in particular focusing on 24-hour culling, which has had a real effect. Relaxation of the measures could allow the rate to rise.\" </p> <p> <b> Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</b> </p> <p> \"The epidemic is under control on two counts: the slaughter is being effectively managed, and the expansion of daily figures is flattening out. There were 16 new cases confirmed yesterday; it was 40 to 50 a day at the height of the epidemic. Had it not been tackled in the way it has been, with the vigorous culling policy for infected animals and those on contiguous premises, then it would have spread completely out of control by now.\"

      "bodyText": "Patrick Holden, director of the Soil Association \"You cannot define 20 new cases as under control; if we had had that in the early stages we would have been desperately alarmed. It's about half the maximum rate, which means that the outbreak may not be quite as out of control as it was. But if you talk to people on the ground in Devon and Cumbria and south west Scotland, there is still a major problem. \"We all hope it will be brought under control. But I think whether or not the disease is in decline and has reached a point where it can be controlled by slaughter, it doesn't remove the question of whether culling is the best strategy either in the tail end of this outbreak or in a new one. \"If you bring the disease under control by killing all the livestock in the area it's a pyrrhic victory.\" Martin Haworth, director of policy, National Farmers' Union \"We're certainly not going to use the phrase 'under control' because it's capable of misinterpretation. It's under control in the sense that all the evidence is that the outbreak has hit its peak and is on the way down, but we will not accept we have defeated the disease until we have seen the last case. \"Complacency would be a danger. The mechanisms in place are having an effect, but if people think it's been defeated when it hasn't and become lax and start moving animals against the rules, or not being so assiduous with disinfecting themselves or vehicles, there's the risk of a new outbreak in an area where we haven't had one so far. That would be a disaster.\" Harold Armstrong, farmer, Bromfield, Cumbria \"Around here we're on target, slaughtering animals within 10 days of reporting the infection, but that doesn't mean it's under control. Nationally the number of farms infected is falling, but the percentage of cases in some areas like Cumbria is rising. \"From here, I can see 12 farms around me that have been infected, and only four that are left. Two-thirds of farms have been infected, and those that are left are on their own, so if they're saying the number is falling, that's because there aren't many farms left.\" Peter Vasey, pedigree cattle breeder, Cumbria \"There do seem to be less cases, but there's also less cattle left to infect in Cumbria. There's a good chance the worst is over, but farmers have suffered badly.\" Paul Ashley, north-west representative for Farmers for Action \"There are smaller numbers of reported cases at the moment, and we are improving the immediate cull. If you look at what was happening at the start of the outbreak, after each reported case there would be an outbreak on a neighbouring farm 10 to 12 days later. Now they are removing the infected animals almost within 24 hours. It is improving. \"If Maff and the army can get on top of the disposal of carcasses, then maybe the timing goals will be achieved and if that happens then we will see a significant reduction in the number of cases.\" Lieutenant-Colonel Barry Hawgood, spokesman for the army's operation in Cumbria \"It's a very dangerous thing to say that the epidemic is now under control. We're confident that we are in control of the situation as it is now, but if we have a flare-up, a new outbreak that we didn't anticipate, it could lead our resources to a level we don't wish to use. We have 250 personnel deployed in Cumbria, and we are capable of culling and clearance under present conditions.\" Professor Mark Woolhouse, veterinary epidemiologist, University of Edinburgh \"If the rate at which each outbreak is generating new outbreaks is greater than one, you are in a period of increase. That was the basis on which we reported the epidemic was out of control. By our estimation it has fallen below one and if it stays there the epidemic is in a declining phase. As long as control measures are maintained, the rate should remain below one. I hope the report will encourage those on the ground that their efforts are working and they should continue with them, in particular focusing on 24-hour culling, which has had a real effect. Relaxation of the measures could allow the rate to rise.\" Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food \"The epidemic is under control on two counts: the slaughter is being effectively managed, and the expansion of daily figures is flattening out. There were 16 new cases confirmed yesterday; it was 40 to 50 a day at the height of the epidemic. Had it not been tackled in the way it has been, with the vigorous culling policy for infected animals and those on contiguous premises, then it would have spread completely out of control by now.\" Email update Sign up for our free daily foot and mouth round-up What's going on?

      "byline": "Leader",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Like veterans from a war, anti-globalisation protesters will win another campaign medal this weekend. The army won its spurs at Seattle in December 1999, laid siege to Prague last September and has now moved on to Quebec, the scene of another battle for global mastery, between the British and the French in 1759. Barricades have been erected, both sides claim they are fit and ready for action, the TV cameras are ready to roll.</p> <p>The fact that between 10,000 and 40,000 protesters are likely to turn up this weekend in a bid to stop a summit designed to pave the way for a free-trade area stretching from the Arctic Circle to Cape Horn, is an indication of how hot an issue globalisation has become over the past decade. In 1993, when the last trade liberalisation talks ended in Geneva, there was barely a non-governmental body in sight, let alone a balaclava-clad anarchist. Now, attempts to create a free trade area of the Americas (FTAA) can attract demonstrators in their tens of thousands and persuade the Canadians to build a 3m-high concrete and chain-link wall around the convention centre.</p> <p>Some of those inside the compound believe the protests are subject to a law of diminishing returns and will eventually peter out. With some justification, they argue that the protesters are either naive rich kids or professional trouble-makers who are good at highlighting the defects of the global market but less convincing when describing their own vision. The alternative to a world in which countries trade with each other in a rules-based multilateral system is not the sort of pre-industrial idyll that some of the protesters imagine, but a law of the jungle in which the richest nations use their power to impose their will on the weak and poor. The idea that trade is intrinsically bad is economic nonsense, and dangerous nonsense at that.</p> <p>But this misses the main point. The protests in Quebec are not going to halt trade, let alone bring about the demise of global capitalism. What they will do is help create space for those with constructive ideas on debt relief, the environment, trade and global economic governance, to influence the world for the better. It is no longer possible for a new round of trade liberalisation talks to be launched by the World Trade Organisation in Qatar this autumn without the needs of developing countries being taken into account. And as the world's biggest drugs companies found when they were forced to drop their court case against South Africa this week, the mobilisation of global protest can change the way corporations operate.</p> <p>This is all to the good, provided that the burden of reform is not just left to non-governmental organisations but shouldered by progressive governments as well. The decade since the collapse of communism has hardly been the triumphal march of let-them-rip markets that the champions of laissez-faire promised, so it is high time that the parties of the centre-left stopped feeling so defensive. The world economy is in a state of flux, with the model of self regulating markets and all-powerful corporations rapidly going out of fashion.

      "bodyText": "Like veterans from a war, anti-globalisation protesters will win another campaign medal this weekend. The army won its spurs at Seattle in December 1999, laid siege to Prague last September and has now moved on to Quebec, the scene of another battle for global mastery, between the British and the French in 1759. Barricades have been erected, both sides claim they are fit and ready for action, the TV cameras are ready to roll. The fact that between 10,000 and 40,000 protesters are likely to turn up this weekend in a bid to stop a summit designed to pave the way for a free-trade area stretching from the Arctic Circle to Cape Horn, is an indication of how hot an issue globalisation has become over the past decade. In 1993, when the last trade liberalisation talks ended in Geneva, there was barely a non-governmental body in sight, let alone a balaclava-clad anarchist. Now, attempts to create a free trade area of the Americas (FTAA) can attract demonstrators in their tens of thousands and persuade the Canadians to build a 3m-high concrete and chain-link wall around the convention centre. Some of those inside the compound believe the protests are subject to a law of diminishing returns and will eventually peter out. With some justification, they argue that the protesters are either naive rich kids or professional trouble-makers who are good at highlighting the defects of the global market but less convincing when describing their own vision. The alternative to a world in which countries trade with each other in a rules-based multilateral system is not the sort of pre-industrial idyll that some of the protesters imagine, but a law of the jungle in which the richest nations use their power to impose their will on the weak and poor. The idea that trade is intrinsically bad is economic nonsense, and dangerous nonsense at that. But this misses the main point. The protests in Quebec are not going to halt trade, let alone bring about the demise of global capitalism. What they will do is help create space for those with constructive ideas on debt relief, the environment, trade and global economic governance, to influence the world for the better. It is no longer possible for a new round of trade liberalisation talks to be launched by the World Trade Organisation in Qatar this autumn without the needs of developing countries being taken into account. And as the world's biggest drugs companies found when they were forced to drop their court case against South Africa this week, the mobilisation of global protest can change the way corporations operate. This is all to the good, provided that the burden of reform is not just left to non-governmental organisations but shouldered by progressive governments as well. The decade since the collapse of communism has hardly been the triumphal march of let-them-rip markets that the champions of laissez-faire promised, so it is high time that the parties of the centre-left stopped feeling so defensive. The world economy is in a state of flux, with the model of self regulating markets and all-powerful corporations rapidly going out of fashion. Governments have found they have power, particularly when prodded by consumers concerned about the food they eat, the air they breathe and the world they live in. For some of those manning the barricades in Quebec, this will be irrelevant. After all, if capitalism really is about to collapse, then one more heave should do it. But the history of the past 200 years suggests otherwise and, for the rest of us, the idea that interventionism is back in fashion can only be welcomed.

      "byline": "Dominic Ridley",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The Basques have been renowned for centuries as fishermen and sailors; it's thought they landed in America long before Columbus. They have defended themselves from invasion by the Romans, Vikings, Visigoths and Moors. They are the longest established people in Europe, and have their own language, Euskera. What the Basques have never had is an independent state of their own.</p> <p>And their rumbling war of independence, which has cost more than 800 lives over the past 30 years, is not - as many Europeans had begun to think - fading away. On the contrary, after the regional elections next month, the conflict is likely to intensify. There are now 2.2 million people living in the northern region of Spain, bordering France, that makes up the Basque country. It was here that some of the bloodiest fighting against Franco took place in the civil war of 1936. And it was in defence of the Basque way of life, under attack from Franco, that ETA - Euskadi Ta Askatasuna or Basque Fatherland and Freedom - was formed in 1959. What began as clandestine meetings of a few scholars, grew quickly into a protest organisation. Franco suppressed the Basques with violence, imprisoning intellectuals, torturing dissidents and outlawing the language. ETA was the only visible opposition to his dictatorship and so enjoyed support from large swathes of Spanish society. In 1968, ETA carried out its first killing, Melton Manzanas, a secret police officer known for his liberal use of torture. It was a popular choice. However, when Franco died and democracy returned in the late 70s, enthusiasm ebbed away; many hoped ETA would lay down its arms. It was not to be. Last year's toll of ETA victims stood at 23, dozens injured, 46 acts of terrorism.</p> <p>The Basque separatists have only one objective - independence. This is despite the fact that Spain is now one of the most devolved federal systems in Europe. The Basque country has its own president and parliament, collects its own taxes, has a police force (the Ertzaintza) and controls education. Approximately 30% of the Basque people speak Euskera and schools now teach in the language. Radio and TV stations broadcast in Euskera. A moderate nationalist party, PNV, is in power in the regional parliament; PNV's leader, Xavier Arzalluz, has never condemned ETA or its killings. Of ETA's first victim in 2001, a military cook from San Sebastian, Arzalluz remarked merely that ETA should select its targets better.</p> <p>There is an intense feeling of claustrophobia in the company of Basque separatists. It is as if they inhabit a stifling bubble with ETA at its centre. Separatist language is littered with the lexicon of death and war. Posters and graffiti championing the terrorists adorn the buildings. Flags in support of ETA prisoners hang from balconies. Bars sympathetic to the cause flourish. Separatists marry within their community, their friends are of the same ilk. Outside the bubble exists the enemy. Within the bubble, sons and daughters grow up surrounded by the symbolism of ETA, of sacrifice, struggle, murder and martyrdom. A new generation is coming to the fore.</p> <p>Iker Gallastegi is a life-long member of the political wing of ETA, Euskal Herritarrok (EH) - though he still calls it Herri Batasuna, its original name. His family is a template for the \"generational uprising\". I met him and his wife Maite in Getxo, a town just outside the capital of the Basque country, Bilbao. This wealthy suburban area, lined with Mercedes and BMWs, is the last place you would expect to be an ETA heartland; nor, to look at them, would you think Iker and Maite were revolutionaries. Yet they sit before me, talking of war and independence. Maite rails against those who think her mad: \"A friend of mine said, 'How the hell are you living - this is not reality.' I said, 'Excuse me, this is real. The trips we do [to prison], these are real.' \"</p> <p>Iker has stood and won as an HB candidate in the local elections but refused to take his seat. \"Why should I, a Basque, enter a Spanish administration. No, we need our own independent government.\" Iker's father and grandfather were also Basque separatists, or, as he calls them, nationalists. \"Thirty-eight years, more than half my life, have been in exile,\" he says. \"My three children were born in exile, like their father. I was exiled in Biarritz where all the Basque nationalist exiles were ETA.\" Within this bubble it is no surprise that his daughter, Osune, had been in prison for collaboration and his niece, Irantzu, is currently imprisoned for membership of the Donosti Commando - one of the oldest and strongest active units in Spain.</p> <p>When I asked how they felt about their daughter's imprisonment, Iker replied matter of factly, \"Obviously it means a lot of suffering for the family. You don't know how you are going to find them, but there, they are great!\" He shrugs. \"So you say to yourself, 'That's all right, they are going to be out in four or five years.' \" Maite explains, \"After talking with her [Osune], I didn't feel relief but very proud. Proud of her strength, and I received strength from her courage.\" Prison, it seems, was a rite of passage for Osune.</p> <p>Iker explained to me how his daughter and others become involved in the war: \"ETA need information, need safe houses. So around them they have eight or 10 groups. Eventually, members of these groups become part of the commando cells.\" He adds, casually: \"Some of them are put in jail or are killed. Well that is the chain.\" Personal sacrifice is expected. As Iker, now in his 70s, says: \"If you're a nationalist it is part of your life.\" His declaration that \"the only battle you lose is the battle you don't fight - if you keep fighting you haven't lost\" strikes a chilling note for those hoping for peace.</p> <p>On May 13, Basque regional elections will be held and, for the first time since democracy returned to Spain, control of the Basque government may well pass from PNV to PP, the Spanish national centre-right party (led by the Spanish president, Jose Maria Aznar), if the latter succeeds in establishing a strange coalition with PSOE, a Socialist party. In contrast, support for EH is down, mainly because of the resumption of the terrorist campaign.</p> <p>EH has for some time been under attack from the Spanish government. In December 1997, when named HB, all 23 of its national committee were sentenced to seven years' imprisonment for collaboration with ETA (released on appeal two years later). Eventually, HB was closed down by the government, hence the renaming and re-emergence as EH. The separatists can generally reckon to win about 20% of the 75 seats in the regional parliament. But they know they would have little chance of winning a referendum on independence for the Basque country.</p> <p>Three years ago there was an attempt to make peace, the \"Tregua\". ETA declared an indefinite end to armed struggle and began talks with the Spanish government in September 1998. For 14 months, terrorist activities ceased. However, the beginning of the talks coincided with a shift to the right in Spain. The new PP-led Spanish government arrested 66 people for ETA collaboration, including one of the peace negotiators. The arrests not only enraged nationalists but moderates within Spain looking for an end to violence.</p> <p>A peace deal without agreement on a separate Basque state would never have satisfied the hard core, but concessions on ETA prisoners might well have appeased the majority. Since then, the government has tightened the screws on Basque nationalism, making numerous arrests. Separatists feel that their backs are against the wall. If PP does gain power in May's regional elections, it is likely ETA will react violently. No longer will the enemy be at the gates, but inside their \"limited\" government. There would be nothing to lose.</p> <p>Waiting in the wings to carry the torch of independence are members of Kale Borroka (Urban Fight). They are the next generation, aged 16-25. Those who excel within Kale Borroka are marked out as future ETA commandos. Urcko Manzisidor, now 23, was the head of the Vizcaya Kale Borroka until he was arrested during the third year of an engineering degree. He explains that Kale Borroka looks to Northern Ireland for inspiration. Every night incidents are linked to the group; cars and cashpoints are burned and homes of the Ertzaintza are attacked. \"Kale Borroka is a collective. It is a member of the movement of Basque Liberation. If not, it would be hooliganism... hundreds of juveniles have been arrested and put in prison for that reason.\" Urcko uses the language of Marxist-Leninism intentionally. To many, the struggle is not just the liberation of the Basque country from the \"yoke of Spanish and French imperialism\" but, importantly, a socialist revolution.</p> <p>Urcko confounds my expectations: he is friendly, amusing and profusely apologetic for not speaking English and being 10 minutes late. He faced 20 charges in Madrid which were eventually reduced to one, \"possession of explosives, and of carrying Molotov cocktails in my car. I have been waiting for three years to be processed...\" Originally his charge sheet included attempted murder and ETA collaboration. Urcko is willing to accept his fate whatever his sentence. \"I will be a nationalist until the day I die.\"</p> <p>A couple of hours after leaving Urcko, I find myself sitting opposite Maialen Basterra in a trendy Bilbao bar. As she sipped from her bottle of mineral water I could not believe this beautiful 21-year-old, softly spoken and flirtatious, could be involved in terrorist acts. At 17, most girls worry about boyfriends, boy bands, make-up and clothes - not her. Maialen's thoughts, then as now, were filled with revolution and independence. \"At 17, they accused me of possession of explosives, carrying Molotov cocktails and belonging to Kale Borroka. I was in prison for a month. In cases like mine the law is arranged so that you are tried like an adult.\" She was \"very lucky\", she says: \"My sentence is three years, but because of my age and the Tregua, they gave me conditional freedom. I can be re-arrested at any time and sent back.\"</p> <p>For people like Maialen the failure of the Tregua reinforces their view that there is no way out but to fight. \"I expect nothing from the 'Spanish Estate'. Our objective is independence. It's now everything or nothing!\" And Maialen, too, has to contend with the weight of history. \"All my family are Basque nationalists. We have always been close to the conflict. My uncle was in prison, for collaboration with ETA, for five or six years.\" Her future is tied to the cause. \"It is my daily life. At some point you internalise [the fear of re-arrest]. Until the day they catch you again...\"</p> <p>Ahoztar Zalaieta, one of three directors of the magazine Ardi Beltza (Black Sheep) that is \"close\" to ETA - indeed it has published suggested \"hit lists\" - once explained to me the Basque nationalist hierarchy. He drew a triangle: he placed ETA (military) at the top; ETA-EKIN (government) below; followed by organisations promoting Euskadi culture - one of them being AEK, an Euskera language school. The conversation returned to haunt me the day Commando Barcelona, one of the most successful units, was broken. A member, Lierni Armendariz, taught at AEK and I had visited the school on my first day in Bilbao. I had spoken to teachers and drank at the bar. It seemed innocuous enough. Wrong. As Ahoztar said, \"ETA is building an alternate society.\" It was then I realised ETA was not so secret, so invisible an entity. Supporters and activists stand next to you as you order coffee.</p> <p>I met Iruri in one of the many Errikotaberna bars in Santutxu. Her sister Olatz was arrested in December 1999 as a member of ETA-EKIN, which was responsible for planning attacks, fundraising and the long-term political direction of ETA. Olatz's picture hangs above the bar next to photographs of other prisoners. These portraits are found in all bars sympathetic to the separatist cause - they have become symbols of martyrdom, propaganda icons. The image of Olatz lowers over her younger sister, who stands before me eaten up with hate and rage. Iruri, who is 24, cannot understand why her sister has been arrested. \"What for?\" she utters in disbelief. Every mishap befalling her and her family is now the fault of the government. \"My parents have had two car crashes while visiting Olatz in prison, which has cost us a lot of money.\" I asked her what she does, \"[I work] in a cultural organisation which tries and solves problems, like why does the local newsagent not speak Euskera and how can we change that.\" I wondered how.</p> <p>I have no doubt Iruri's parents will soon be visiting two daughters in prison, and here lies the crux of the problem. Though Iruri believes in Basque independence she now supports the cause not simply as a political ideal, but for revenge.</p> <p>Two arrests in Mexico and the end of Commando Barcelona in the space of four days had ratcheted up the tension within the separatist community. A contact introduced me to Gotzom, if that's his real name. Because of \"recent setbacks\", Gotzom wanted to get ETA's \"core message\" across. When I put it to him: You have a nationalist party in power which believes in independence, Gotzom's reply is: \"PNV has a lot of people educated in Madrid. They haven't been educated to fight. They are not prepared to suffer psychologically... The Spanish Estate doesn't recognise us as a political problem but as crazy people shooting... The state power is banks, military, capitalism, and they don't want to accept Basque traditions, culture, and language. You have to realise, Spain came here. They are trying to put their culture, their language here. They are placing business from the Spanish Estate here and they are keeping control of everything in their hands. The people of this country want to decide by themselves. We will be unhappy until that day.\"</p> <p>When asked about the innocent victims of ETA, Gotzom replied: \"I am not happy with the suffering of the two sides but I am happy with our achievements.\" Those I have spoken to over the question of prisoners take a similar line: \"The human suffering of prisoners and families are a calculated punishment from those in power\" - but, paradoxically, the family of prisoners are a source of strength and renewed lifeblood for ETA.</p> <p>The dispersal around Spain and France of over 500 prisoners, jailed for their links with ETA, is a political problem that the government is unwilling to face. It ties families to the cause who previously wished for no involvement. Once entering the separatist reality, few can turn back. The family will often have to travel hundreds of miles to see their relation, spend money they do not have and feel obligated to join protest marches. The prisoner question is a crucial obstacle to peace.</p> <p>Angel organises the family demonstrations held every Friday in Bilbao. At the age of 66 his life has dramatically changed. Five years ago his son, Augustin, was apprehended trying to kill the president of the Basque Parliament, Juan Maria Atutxa (PNV). Though still waiting for a trial date, Augustin is likely to receive a 30-year sentence. Angel's eyes well up when he speaks of his son. \"I see him every week for 40 minutes. My life is completely ruined, sentimentally and economically. He is always in my mind.\" He has to make a 800km round-trip, and while Angel claims he lives in the hope of one day seeing his son free, in his heart he knows it will not happen. Augustin will be freed momentarily on compassionate grounds to say goodbye over his father's grave.</p> <p>In stark contrast to the wealth of Getxo, Santurtzi is an old fishing village on the north coast. Here I meet Esteban Betolaza, his wife, Belen, and stepmother, Edurne Fullaondo. Edurne's two sons are imprisoned for membership of Commando Vizcaya. Their flat is on an impoverished housing estate. Many new recruits for Kale Borroka come from the disenfranchised, and from Esteban's neighbourhood alone there are 16 ETA members in prison and two on the run.</p> <p>Over coffee and cake, we discuss their world of terrorism. Esteban was imprisoned in Paris for two-and-a-half years. In France, ETA commandos always carry a pistol with a round in the chamber. If they are caught, the loaded gun ensures a jail sentence in France, preventing extradition to Spain where sentencing would be far more severe. Esteban is 42 but prison and, he claims, torture seem to have prematurely aged him. Belen is on the verge of tears. Edurne weeps, but she drives her left fist into her right hand as she denounces the government: \"I am really proud of my sons and what they have done.\"</p> <p>The family may be from a different economic background from Iker's but all separatist families share a common experience. Politics is their life. As Esteban puts it: \"It is the political idea that gives us strength. This is a war and we are going to stay fighting.\" It seems that to lay down arms without achieving independence would be to dishonour the memory of those who \"have sacrificed themselves for the cause\". Yet, you begin to wonder whether without the cause these Basque activists fear there could be a void in their lives. The cause gives a sense of personal respect, of personal identity, a feeling of community. I wonder whether Urcko and Maialen are strong enough to be able to break away from their \"generational uprising\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Basques have been renowned for centuries as fishermen and sailors; it's thought they landed in America long before Columbus. They have defended themselves from invasion by the Romans, Vikings, Visigoths and Moors. They are the longest established people in Europe, and have their own language, Euskera. What the Basques have never had is an independent state of their own. And their rumbling war of independence, which has cost more than 800 lives over the past 30 years, is not - as many Europeans had begun to think - fading away. On the contrary, after the regional elections next month, the conflict is likely to intensify. There are now 2.2 million people living in the northern region of Spain, bordering France, that makes up the Basque country. It was here that some of the bloodiest fighting against Franco took place in the civil war of 1936. And it was in defence of the Basque way of life, under attack from Franco, that ETA - Euskadi Ta Askatasuna or Basque Fatherland and Freedom - was formed in 1959. What began as clandestine meetings of a few scholars, grew quickly into a protest organisation. Franco suppressed the Basques with violence, imprisoning intellectuals, torturing dissidents and outlawing the language. ETA was the only visible opposition to his dictatorship and so enjoyed support from large swathes of Spanish society. In 1968, ETA carried out its first killing, Melton Manzanas, a secret police officer known for his liberal use of torture. It was a popular choice. However, when Franco died and democracy returned in the late 70s, enthusiasm ebbed away; many hoped ETA would lay down its arms. It was not to be. Last year's toll of ETA victims stood at 23, dozens injured, 46 acts of terrorism. The Basque separatists have only one objective - independence. This is despite the fact that Spain is now one of the most devolved federal systems in Europe. The Basque country has its own president and parliament, collects its own taxes, has a police force (the Ertzaintza) and controls education. Approximately 30% of the Basque people speak Euskera and schools now teach in the language. Radio and TV stations broadcast in Euskera. A moderate nationalist party, PNV, is in power in the regional parliament; PNV's leader, Xavier Arzalluz, has never condemned ETA or its killings. Of ETA's first victim in 2001, a military cook from San Sebastian, Arzalluz remarked merely that ETA should select its targets better. There is an intense feeling of claustrophobia in the company of Basque separatists. It is as if they inhabit a stifling bubble with ETA at its centre. Separatist language is littered with the lexicon of death and war. Posters and graffiti championing the terrorists adorn the buildings. Flags in support of ETA prisoners hang from balconies. Bars sympathetic to the cause flourish. Separatists marry within their community, their friends are of the same ilk. Outside the bubble exists the enemy. Within the bubble, sons and daughters grow up surrounded by the symbolism of ETA, of sacrifice, struggle, murder and martyrdom. A new generation is coming to the fore. Iker Gallastegi is a life-long member of the political wing of ETA, Euskal Herritarrok (EH) - though he still calls it Herri Batasuna, its original name. His family is a template for the \"generational uprising\". I met him and his wife Maite in Getxo, a town just outside the capital of the Basque country, Bilbao. This wealthy suburban area, lined with Mercedes and BMWs, is the last place you would expect to be an ETA heartland; nor, to look at them, would you think Iker and Maite were revolutionaries. Yet they sit before me, talking of war and independence. Maite rails against those who think her mad: \"A friend of mine said, 'How the hell are you living - this is not reality.' I said, 'Excuse me, this is real. The trips we do [to prison], these are real.' \" Iker has stood and won as an HB candidate in the local elections but refused to take his seat. \"Why should I, a Basque, enter a Spanish administration. No, we need our own independent government.\" Iker's father and grandfather were also Basque separatists, or, as he calls them, nationalists. \"Thirty-eight years, more than half my life, have been in exile,\" he says. \"My three children were born in exile, like their father. I was exiled in Biarritz where all the Basque nationalist exiles were ETA.\" Within this bubble it is no surprise that his daughter, Osune, had been in prison for collaboration and his niece, Irantzu, is currently imprisoned for membership of the Donosti Commando - one of the oldest and strongest active units in Spain. When I asked how they felt about their daughter's imprisonment, Iker replied matter of factly, \"Obviously it means a lot of suffering for the family. You don't know how you are going to find them, but there, they are great!\" He shrugs. \"So you say to yourself, 'That's all right, they are going to be out in four or five years.' \" Maite explains, \"After talking with her [Osune], I didn't feel relief but very proud. Proud of her strength, and I received strength from her courage.\" Prison, it seems, was a rite of passage for Osune. Iker explained to me how his daughter and others become involved in the war: \"ETA need information, need safe houses. So around them they have eight or 10 groups. Eventually, members of these groups become part of the commando cells.\" He adds, casually: \"Some of them are put in jail or are killed. Well that is the chain.\" Personal sacrifice is expected. As Iker, now in his 70s, says: \"If you're a nationalist it is part of your life.\" His declaration that \"the only battle you lose is the battle you don't fight - if you keep fighting you haven't lost\" strikes a chilling note for those hoping for peace. On May 13, Basque regional elections will be held and, for the first time since democracy returned to Spain, control of the Basque government may well pass from PNV to PP, the Spanish national centre-right party (led by the Spanish president, Jose Maria Aznar), if the latter succeeds in establishing a strange coalition with PSOE, a Socialist party. In contrast, support for EH is down, mainly because of the resumption of the terrorist campaign. EH has for some time been under attack from the Spanish government. In December 1997, when named HB, all 23 of its national committee were sentenced to seven years' imprisonment for collaboration with ETA (released on appeal two years later). Eventually, HB was closed down by the government, hence the renaming and re-emergence as EH. The separatists can generally reckon to win about 20% of the 75 seats in the regional parliament. But they know they would have little chance of winning a referendum on independence for the Basque country. Three years ago there was an attempt to make peace, the \"Tregua\". ETA declared an indefinite end to armed struggle and began talks with the Spanish government in September 1998. For 14 months, terrorist activities ceased. However, the beginning of the talks coincided with a shift to the right in Spain. The new PP-led Spanish government arrested 66 people for ETA collaboration, including one of the peace negotiators. The arrests not only enraged nationalists but moderates within Spain looking for an end to violence. A peace deal without agreement on a separate Basque state would never have satisfied the hard core, but concessions on ETA prisoners might well have appeased the majority. Since then, the government has tightened the screws on Basque nationalism, making numerous arrests. Separatists feel that their backs are against the wall. If PP does gain power in May's regional elections, it is likely ETA will react violently. No longer will the enemy be at the gates, but inside their \"limited\" government. There would be nothing to lose. Waiting in the wings to carry the torch of independence are members of Kale Borroka (Urban Fight). They are the next generation, aged 16-25. Those who excel within Kale Borroka are marked out as future ETA commandos. Urcko Manzisidor, now 23, was the head of the Vizcaya Kale Borroka until he was arrested during the third year of an engineering degree. He explains that Kale Borroka looks to Northern Ireland for inspiration. Every night incidents are linked to the group; cars and cashpoints are burned and homes of the Ertzaintza are attacked. \"Kale Borroka is a collective. It is a member of the movement of Basque Liberation. If not, it would be hooliganism... hundreds of juveniles have been arrested and put in prison for that reason.\" Urcko uses the language of Marxist-Leninism intentionally. To many, the struggle is not just the liberation of the Basque country from the \"yoke of Spanish and French imperialism\" but, importantly, a socialist revolution. Urcko confounds my expectations: he is friendly, amusing and profusely apologetic for not speaking English and being 10 minutes late. He faced 20 charges in Madrid which were eventually reduced to one, \"possession of explosives, and of carrying Molotov cocktails in my car. I have been waiting for three years to be processed...\" Originally his charge sheet included attempted murder and ETA collaboration. Urcko is willing to accept his fate whatever his sentence. \"I will be a nationalist until the day I die.\" A couple of hours after leaving Urcko, I find myself sitting opposite Maialen Basterra in a trendy Bilbao bar. As she sipped from her bottle of mineral water I could not believe this beautiful 21-year-old, softly spoken and flirtatious, could be involved in terrorist acts. At 17, most girls worry about boyfriends, boy bands, make-up and clothes - not her. Maialen's thoughts, then as now, were filled with revolution and independence. \"At 17, they accused me of possession of explosives, carrying Molotov cocktails and belonging to Kale Borroka. I was in prison for a month. In cases like mine the law is arranged so that you are tried like an adult.\" She was \"very lucky\", she says: \"My sentence is three years, but because of my age and the Tregua, they gave me conditional freedom. I can be re-arrested at any time and sent back.\" For people like Maialen the failure of the Tregua reinforces their view that there is no way out but to fight. \"I expect nothing from the 'Spanish Estate'. Our objective is independence. It's now everything or nothing!\" And Maialen, too, has to contend with the weight of history. \"All my family are Basque nationalists. We have always been close to the conflict. My uncle was in prison, for collaboration with ETA, for five or six years.\" Her future is tied to the cause. \"It is my daily life. At some point you internalise [the fear of re-arrest]. Until the day they catch you again...\" Ahoztar Zalaieta, one of three directors of the magazine Ardi Beltza (Black Sheep) that is \"close\" to ETA - indeed it has published suggested \"hit lists\" - once explained to me the Basque nationalist hierarchy. He drew a triangle: he placed ETA (military) at the top; ETA-EKIN (government) below; followed by organisations promoting Euskadi culture - one of them being AEK, an Euskera language school. The conversation returned to haunt me the day Commando Barcelona, one of the most successful units, was broken. A member, Lierni Armendariz, taught at AEK and I had visited the school on my first day in Bilbao. I had spoken to teachers and drank at the bar. It seemed innocuous enough. Wrong. As Ahoztar said, \"ETA is building an alternate society.\" It was then I realised ETA was not so secret, so invisible an entity. Supporters and activists stand next to you as you order coffee. I met Iruri in one of the many Errikotaberna bars in Santutxu. Her sister Olatz was arrested in December 1999 as a member of ETA-EKIN, which was responsible for planning attacks, fundraising and the long-term political direction of ETA. Olatz's picture hangs above the bar next to photographs of other prisoners. These portraits are found in all bars sympathetic to the separatist cause - they have become symbols of martyrdom, propaganda icons.

I have no doubt Iruri's parents will soon be visiting two daughters in prison, and here lies the crux of the problem. Though Iruri believes in Basque independence she now supports the cause not simply as a political ideal, but for revenge. Two arrests in Mexico and the end of Commando Barcelona in the space of four days had ratcheted up the tension within the separatist community. A contact introduced me to Gotzom, if that's his real name. Because of \"recent setbacks\", Gotzom wanted to get ETA's \"core message\" across. When I put it to him: You have a nationalist party in power which believes in independence, Gotzom's reply is: \"PNV has a lot of people educated in Madrid. They haven't been educated to fight.

      "bodyText": "The final break-up of Yugoslavia will be at stake when voters in Montenegro go to the polls tomorrow in a general election dominated by one issue: whether the mountainous Balkan republic land should declare independence. President Milo Djukanovic's Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS) and its coalition partners, the Social Democratic party, say they will call an independence referendum if they win. Such a move has been fiercely criticised by the international community, which says it would encourage separatist movements in neighbouring Bosnia and Kosovo and prompt further instability in the region. The contact group on the Balkans -the US, Britain, Germany, France, Italy and Russia - warned Montenegro earlier this week that it would cut off aid to Montenegro if it pursues the goal of independence. The latest opinion polls suggest that the independence alliance will win. But another poll focused on voting intentions in a referendum gave a narrow margin of victory to those wishing to remain part of the federal Yugoslavia. Montenegro and Serbia are the last two republics left inside present-day Yugoslavia, a state which once included Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Macedonia. Montenegro fought successfully for centuries to keep the Ottoman empire at bay, and its independence was formally recognised at the international Congress of Berlin in 1878. It was absorbed into Yugoslavia in 1918 at the end of the first world war. Despite the importance of tomorrow's vote, the run-up to the election has been comparatively low key. Apart from a few pro-government posters on advertising hoardings, there is little evidence of political activity on the streets of the capital, Podgorica. \"I think that people's minds have been made up pretty much already, also we no longer have the problem of Milosevic still being in power,\" said Sreten Bogojgevic, 36, an electronics engineer. \"People are taking things seriously, but with a lot less emotion.\" The government coalition has presented independence as both \"inevitable\" and a natural continuation of Montenegro's development since 1998, the year in which it removed itself from federal Yugoslavians institutions in protest against the Milosevic regime's policies. Since the feud, Montenegro has developed its own customs and banking systems - it has adopted the deutschmark as its own currency and abandoning the Yugoslav dinar. The government parties have boycotted all federal elections and none of their MPs has attended the federal parliament. The last remaining federal institution with any clout is the Yugoslav army. The Socialist Democratic deputy prime minister, Dragisa Burzan, says Montenegro's interests can no longer be served in a federation with its neighbour. \"Montenegro would suffer very much, it would not have a direct approach to funds from foreign governments.

One source said: \"When the board has given sober and calm consideration to the situation, the directors will make a statement.\"</p> <p>Wolves &amp; Dudley is Britain's biggest regional brewer, producing traditional ales such as Marston's and Cameron. The company has four breweries and 1,700 pubs, including the Pitcher &amp; Piano bar chain.</p> <p>There may yet be another blip in the takeover battle. Industry sources said Wolves &amp; Dudley's directors would assess the \"credibility\" as well as the \"level\" of the offers.</p> <p>The company had hoped that interested parties would submit formal bids, rather than indicative proposals, and directors could argue that the offers lack certainty.</p> <p>Wolves &amp; Dudley rejected a preliminary offer of 500p-a-share from Mr Breare last August, saying it failed to reflect the value of the business. However, shareholders put pressure on chief executive David Thompson to restart the sale process. Investors are unlikely to tolerate the board rejecting another opportunity to sell the business.</p> <p>Wolves &amp; Dudley ran into trouble after struggling to integrate two big acquisitions - Mansfield Brewery and Marston, Thompson &amp; Evershed. The firm has been a victim of the declining popularity of community pubs. Its shares jumped 22.5p to 481p.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Pubmaster is on the brink of winning a nine-month battle for control of Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley Breweries, after submitting a \u00a3480m \"indicative offer\" for the company minutes before yesterday's midday deadline for bids. The privately owned pub company, which is based in Hartlepool, is understood to have submitted a 510p-a-share proposal, beating a 500p package from leisure entrepreneur Robert Breare. Wolves &amp; Dudley's board will meet on Monday to examine the offers. One source said: \"When the board has given sober and calm consideration to the situation, the directors will make a statement.\" Wolves &amp; Dudley is Britain's biggest regional brewer, producing traditional ales such as Marston's and Cameron. The company has four breweries and 1,700 pubs, including the Pitcher &amp; Piano bar chain. There may yet be another blip in the takeover battle. Industry sources said Wolves &amp; Dudley's directors would assess the \"credibility\" as well as the \"level\" of the offers. The company had hoped that interested parties would submit formal bids, rather than indicative proposals, and directors could argue that the offers lack certainty. Wolves &amp; Dudley rejected a preliminary offer of 500p-a-share from Mr Breare last August, saying it failed to reflect the value of the business. However, shareholders put pressure on chief executive David Thompson to restart the sale process. Investors are unlikely to tolerate the board rejecting another opportunity to sell the business. Wolves &amp; Dudley ran into trouble after struggling to integrate two big acquisitions - Mansfield Brewery and Marston, Thompson &amp; Evershed. The firm has been a victim of the declining popularity of community pubs. Its shares jumped 22.5p to 481p.",

      "body": "<p>The Etireno rocks gently against the quay; the smallest ship in a small west African port. It chugs around the Gulf of Guinea, carrying cassava and cars, boxes of soap and barrels of hooch, and sometimes children.</p> <p>About this time last week, the government of Benin reported the Nigerian-registered ship missing at sea with 250 child slaves on board. The children looked ill, according to port authorities in Douala, Cameroon where the ship put in for refuelling. The Etireno was a notorious slave ship, the UN children's fund (Unicef) confirmed.</p> <p>Its captain, a desperate man with a criminal past, might throw the children overboard. And Benin, everyone noted, was where the African slave trade began. At midnight on Tuesday, the 40-metre ship was sighted off Cotonou, Benin's capital, and a crowd of ministers, diplomats and UN officials hastily summoned.</p> <p>An hour later, the diplomats were off home to bed. There were no chains or shackles aboard the Etireno and few children, all of them apparently accompanied by their parents. Someone had made a big mistake, said Lawrence Onome, the ship's Nigerian captain. The Etireno had been turned back from the Gabonese capital of Libreville because its 114 adult passengers had no papers to enter the region's richest country. The ship was carrying illegal migrants, not unaccompanied children, he said.</p> <p>Etireno, coincidentally, means \"end of story\".</p> <p>But it was not quite finished. Unicef took 31 children off the ship to be interviewed. Five days later, they are still in transit centres for distressed children. The adults first thought to be their parents had disappeared and just one child has been claimed. It seems the Etireno was carrying child slaves after all.</p> <p>\"These were unaccompanied children,\" Esther Guluma, an Israeli who is Unicef's representative in Benin, said yesterday. \"Sorry - they are very highly suspected unaccompanied children,\" she added, conscious of having jumped the gun once already this week.</p> <p>The truth about the Etireno may be less dramatic than first suggested, but far more typical of west and central Africa's exploding trade in children - and far more insidious for that.</p> <p>Benin's child protection police have been called in to confirm that the children were being trafficked from their village homes to slavery in oil-rich Gabon. Until they do, Terre des Hommes, a Swiss organisation caring for the 24 youngest, is guarding them jealously. But the evidence is already persuasive.</p> <p>The children at Terre des Hommes are aged between four and 14. They include two four-year old boys from Mali, six children from Togo and 16 from Benin, according to Ms Guluma. These countries are the three biggest providers of the 200,000 children that Unicef estimates are trafficked across the region's borders each year. Gabon and Ivory Coast are the biggest receivers.</p> <p>Emilie Kpadanou, a child psychologist, interviewed the children. \"The older children said they were going to work. The little ones didn't know where they were going,\" she said. \"They all want to go home to their mothers.\"</p> <p>It is not unusual for ships to traffic children across the Gulf of Guinea. Over the past 10 years, as a result of poverty and as an abuse of Africa's extended family tradition, whereby poor children are placed with wealthier family friends, child slavery has become endemic. It is rare for a slave ship to be turned away.</p> <p>Morris Landlord, 36, the Etireno's second-in-command, was the only man on board the ship yesterday: Mr Onome and seven of the 12 Nigerian crew members were being interviewed by police. The 40-metre ship's cargo, mainly a palm-gin called ogogoro, was still on board; the small galley smelled faintly of the 142 bodies that crowded it for more than two weeks. Mr Landlord said there had been no unaccompanied children on board. Otherwise, his version of what happened in Libreville is close to Ms Kpadanou's.</p> <p>On April 4, two days after the ship docked, the passengers disembarked. But when Gabonese police saw most had no papers, they very aggressively ordered everyone back, he said.</p> <p>Ms Kpadanou said policemen threw some children off the quay into the water, forcing adult passengers to dive in after them. The Etireno was put to sea without refuelling or taking on water, and with a police gunboat on either side, Mr Landlord said. He says he does not know why the police reacted so violently.</p> <p>Ms Kpadanou thinks it was because the ship was trying to unload too many children, risking a scandal. \"Four or five, they can get away with,\" she said. More than 40, including 10 youths, was too many.</p> <p>On April 8, the ship docked at Douala, Cameroon, for refuelling. During its five-day voyage from there to Cotonou - the passengers sharing a tin of sardines and a loaf of bread a day among six - the Beninois rumour mill inflated the number of children. As they neared Cotonou, the crew listened to the BBC World Service in horror, said Mr Landlord.</p> <p>He says the Etireno will soon be back in business - \"there's no better ship for ferrying people in Africa\". At 7am, he was tucking into the ogogoro. \"It's good for fever and nerves,\" he said. He was expecting the police any minute.</p> <p>Cotonou is the busiest port in Benin and Togo. A well-maintained highway, courtesy of the World Bank, runs northwards, towards impoverished Mali and Burkina Faso. The unusual combination of a good infrastructure linking desperately poor rural areas is the dynamic that makes Benin a trafficker's paradise.</p> <p>Isaac, 10, was brought to Terre des Hommes a week ago, after being stopped at the Ghanaian border. A friend of his father said he could get Isaac a job making cooking pots in Ivory Coast. So Isaac left his village in Benin's southern Za-Kpota region at night in a car packed with five other children, including his elder sister, and seven adults.</p> <p>One of his six brothers and most of his friends had already left for Ivory Coast and he was happy to go too. \"It was normal,\" said Isaac, his head barely reaching above the back of his chair. \"In Ivory Coast you can learn a trade; if I'd stayed I'd have done nothing.\"</p> <p>Isaac crossed into Togo without a hitch and was met at the Ghanaian border by a woman who was to take him on to Ivory Coast, before they were stopped by police. \"They were fierce and asked a lot of questions I couldn't understand,\" said Isaac, scratching at the eczema on his arms. Isaac is not afraid his father will be angry to see him when he goes home; but he still wants to learn to make pots.</p> <p>According to Alfonso Gonzalez-Jaggli, Terre des Homme's Togo and Benin delegate, Isaac's story is typical, down to his insistence that his parents were paid nothing. \"It's usually too hard for them to think their fathers could put a price on them,\" he said.</p> <p>Anti-slavery International estimates children are bought in villages for as little as \u00a310. Increasing sums then change hands as they are passed along a chain of intermediaries, transporters and border smugglers - such as the woman Isaac described. The children are finally sold, typically to cocoa plantation owners in Ivory Coast or as domestics in Gabon, for up to \u00a3300 a head.</p> <p>The Pied Piper who leads the children away with their parents' blessing - Isaac's father's friend - is the key to this modern slavery. Often one of the child's own relatives, he is commissioned to take full advantage of the extended family, and of the poor man's assumption that anywhere is better than here.</p> <p>\"Once people were taken from here in chains. The tragedy now is that they go willingly looking for a better future - they all learn the truth eventually,\" said Mr Gonzalez-Jaggli, whose office is decorated with photographs documenting malnourished children, scarred by flogging.</p> <p>\"Slavery is the scourge of west and central Africa, and it could spread,\" said Rima Sala, Unicef regional director in the Ivory Coast capital, Abidjan.</p> <p>\"For Africa, with its history, it is the final humiliation.\"</p>",

Often one of the child's own relatives, he is commissioned to take full advantage of the extended family, and of the poor man's assumption that anywhere is better than here. \"Once people were taken from here in chains. The tragedy now is that they go willingly looking for a better future - they all learn the truth eventually,\" said Mr Gonzalez-Jaggli, whose office is decorated with photographs documenting malnourished children, scarred by flogging. \"Slavery is the scourge of west and central Africa, and it could spread,\" said Rima Sala, Unicef regional director in the Ivory Coast capital, Abidjan. \"For Africa, with its history, it is the final humiliation.\"",

      "bodyText": "France's \"Angolagate\" arms and corruption scandal collected another high-ranking official yesterday when investigators opened two separate inquiries into Charles Pasqua, a former interior minister and a possible candidate in next year's presidential election. Judges investigating the affair in which the eldest son of the late President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was jailed on suspicion of arms-trafficking and money-laundering last year believe Mr Pasqua and his Rally for France (RPF) may have received kickbacks from the multimillion-pound deals. Mr Pasqua, a leading figures in President Jacques Chirac's Rally for the Republic (RPR) movement before be created the anti-European RPF, is one of France's most senior and influential politicians. He has heatedly denied the judges' allegations that the party and its 1999 European election campaign were funded illegally. \"The accounts of the RPF are completely clean, as are those of its campaign for the 1999 European elections,\" he said. \"This is an attempt to destabilise democracy. These investigations and accusations are trumped-up rubbish,\" he said. \"I make a nice target, but I await the evidence.\" The judges, Philippe Courroye and Isabelle Prevost-Deprez, are investigating the illicit sale of Russian arms worth \u00a3350m to the Angolan government in the 1990s by Brenco International. The company was owned by the imprisoned businessman Pierre Falcone and advised by Jean-Christophe Mitterrand. Mr Mitterrand, who built up a big network of high-level African contacts serving for six years as his father's special adviser on African affairs, was released on \u00a3500,000 bail in January. But he remains under investigation for influence peddling, complicity in arms trafficking and abuse of funds in relation to the arms sales. The investigating judges suspect that the illicit arms deals may have been part of high-level Franco-Angolan accords negotiated by Mr Pasqua, then France's interior minister, and the Angolan president, Edouardo dos Santos. They also suspect that some of Mr Falcone's money may have found its way into the coffers of the RPF. As interior minister for two terms under President Mitterrand in the 1990s, Mr Pasqua oversaw arms export licences and he was ultimately in charge of the state arms export company, for which Mr Falcone acted as a consultant and whose former director, Bernard Poussier, is now under arrest. The judges already know that Brenco paid \u00a31.3m into a numbered Swiss bank account in Mr Mitterrand's name. They have also found that the company paid \u00a3300,000 to Mr Pasqua's chief Africa aide, Jean-Charles Marchiani, and \u00a3150,000 to France Africa Orient, an organisation jointly headed by the former interior minister and his diplomatic adviser, Bernard Guillet, who is also under arrest. Questioned by the judges about the RPF's financing, Philippe de Villiers, a former deputy leader of the party who has broken off all contact with Mr Pasqua, said earlier this year: \"The Mitterrand-Pasqua affair is very major, an affair of state with intercontinental ramifications and barely imaginable future developments\". Part of the judges' investigations will focus on a controversial \"loan\" of \u00a3750,000 to the RPF by Marthe Mondoloni, the boss of the betting industry in Gabon. Ms Mondoloni's father, Michel Tomi, a close friend of Mr Pasqua who runs a string of casinos throughout west Africa, is under investigation in Monaco on suspicion of money-laundering. The news of the inquiries into the affairs of Mr Pasqua, a portly, plain-speaking Corsican, came just days after one of Mr Guillet's assistants, Sabine de la Laurencie, told the newspaper Le Figaro that she made several visits to Geneva and Luxembourg in the 1990s to collect mysterious locked briefcases stuffed with cash for her boss, who at the time was Mr Pasqua's adviser at the interior ministry. Ms De la Laurencie said this arrangement continued until very recently. Among the Pasqua donors she allegedly met on her trips abroad was Nasir Abid, an Iraqi billionaire who is wanted under an international arrest warrant for his alleged involvement in another major French corruption case, the Elf scandal Mr Pasqua's name has also been linked to that affair. \"Mr Guillet is one of the kingpins of the RPF's foreign financing,\" Ms De la Laurencie said. \"It is clear that Mr Pasqua is aware of that and of this method of party funding.\"",

      "bodyText": "Mathias Rust, the daredevil teenage pilot who gained world notoriety for landing his single-engine Cessna plane in Moscow's Red Square in 1987, returned to the spotlight this week after years of obscurity when a German court convicted him of shoplifting. Rust was fined \u00a33,300 for the theft last November of a \u00a360 cashmere pullover from a Hamburg department store, in what the judge condemned as a \"brazen act\". It marked a new low in the life of the 33-year-old aviation enthusiast who was feted in the west after flying across 500 miles of some of the most heavily guarded parts of the Soviet Union in May 1987 on what he described as a \"mission of peace\". He was lauded too for his outlandish attempts to broker a peace deal with Soviet leaders. Curious onlookers gathered outside the court in Pinneberg, close to Hamburg, this week to catch a glimpse of the man who, on a national border guards' holiday, landed his aircraft on the bridge behind St Basil's cathedral before taxiing on to the cobbles of Red Square next to Lenin's mausoleum. His stunt led to the resignations of both the Soviet defence minister and the air marshal in charge of air defence command. The judge in this week's trial paid tribute to the German, dubbed the teenage Red Baron, and said he had put on his best tie on the occasion of having \"such a prominent person with international court experience\" in the dock. The conviction was the latest disaster to befall Rust since his flying feat. In 1991 he was sentenced by a Hamburg court to two-and-a-half years in prison for stabbing a student nurse who had refused to kiss him at the hospital where he was doing his civil service. \"It was then the truth emerged that he really was crazy,\" wrote the Hamburger Morgenpost. Rust was given a lenient sentence for the stabbing because of the traumatic 432 days he had already served in a Russian labour camp for his flying escapade. He was released early and later returned to Moscow, where he tried and failed to rekindle the attention he had received years before. False rumours of his death had begun to emerge from Moscow when he reappeared suddenly in 1996 in a court near Hamburg. Although he had allegedly made a fortune from his aviation exploit, he was filing for bankruptcy, claiming he could not pay the costs of a newspaper libel trial he had lost. Less than five months later, his money problems were apparently solved when he converted to Hinduism and got engaged to the daughter of a rich Indian tea merchant. Rust now lives in Berlin with his wife, works in a grocery store and thinks often of his Russian adventure. \"It was as if I had reached beyond the borders of reality,\" he told Stern recently. \"It was a once in a lifetime experience.\" He no longer flies, however. \"They took my flying licence away and in order to get it back I have to prove that I'm not round the bend,\" he said. \"I'm just not willing to do that.\"",

But these days, getting launched as a composer is one thing; staying afloat quite another. Music publishers are increasingly wary of taking on new contracts, especially since the changes in Performing Rights Society revenue are hitting their income from new music so hard. As a result many composers are publishing their music themselves; but they still have to get it performed, and managing to interest orchestras is notoriously hard. </p> <p>The British orchestras would probably say that they are doing their bit for new music through their composer-in-residence schemes, which seem to be very much in vogue at the moment. Almost all the major British orchestras have some such arrangement in place through which they commission a series of new works from the selected composer and involve him or her in workshops and educational projects throughout the tenancy. </p> <p>It seems at first sight a totally admirable idea: the composers are able to polish their orchestral craft by working closely with the players, while the orchestras gain more expertise playing unfamiliar and often demanding scores. And when the right composer is matched to the right organisation, it really can be mutually beneficial. When Mark-Anthony Turnage was appointed to the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra in 1989, in one of the first of these schemes to get off the ground, he wrote three major works for the CBSO and his orchestral writing came on in leaps and bounds.</p> <p> But when Turnage went to Birmingham he was in his 20s and still in the process of establishing himself as a distinctive voice in British music. The arrangement suited him perfectly at the time, just as it should Julian Anderson, now in his early 30s, who joined the CBSO in the same position at the beginning of this year; and also the immensely promising 24-year-old Stuart MacRae, who is currently composer-in-association with the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra. But it is harder to see the justification for the partnership of James MacMillan with the BBC Philharmonic, for instance, or Michael Berkeley with the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.

Cashflow is ever more important to the orchestras - the sums involved can make a significant difference to their budgets. </p> <p>Though the same amount of cash might be spread much more profitably in artistic terms among a whole range of younger composers, such commissions don't make such a tidy package, and don't fit so comfortably within the Arts Council's inflexible framework.

      "body": "<p> Scientists in Chicago, Smallweed read with a shudder this week, have constructed a cyborg - a half-living, half-robot creature which unites a brain stem from the larva of a lamprey with a robot manufactured in Switzerland. This is a very significant breakthrough. It revolutionises at a stroke our view of the lamprey, a creature which up to now has had the kind of odious reputation which, were it human, would have driven it to summon Max Clifford. </p> <p>The lamprey belongs to the class known as Agnatha, a type of primitive, fishlike, jawless veterbrate which also includes the hagfish. Out of respect for the hagfish, the two should not be confused. Most live in the sea, though some spend their lives in landlocked lakes. These sinister creatures - I thought of printing a picture, but abstained for fear of frightening you: next week, perhaps, when we're all a week older - prey on innocent fish, to which they attach themselves using a sucking disc and ferocious teeth. They have also been guilty in our own country of regicide. </p> <p>Lampreys killed Henry I: not because they attacked his plump body as he swam in the Bedfordshire Ouse, but because he ate too many and died, as it used to be said, of \"a surfeit of lampreys\". In the Great Lakes, where they fasten impartially on to lake trout, salmon, rainbow trout (steelhead), whitefish, chub, walleye and catfish, they have recently been subjected to what the Great Lakes Fishery Commission describes as a programme of integrated lampricide which aims to reduce the population of parasitic lampreys in Lake Huron and Northern Michigan by 85% by the year 2015. Whether the need to collect immature lampreys to power a new race of cyborgs will interfere with this enterprise is not clear, at least not to me. </p> <p> <strong>To those</strong> with Smallweed's egalitarian tastes, it would seem only right that the newly discovered talent of this long-despised group ought now to be recognised, perhaps with some kind of financial reward. Let me therefore commend to Max Clifford, or whoever is now looking after their interests, an advertisement in G2 two mornings ago for what is decribed as a universal dental implant. Dr A Di Giulio and Dr D Di Giulio of Wimpole Street, it reveals, are offering safe implants for those with thin, low or hollow jawbones. Their methods could no doubt be swiftly adopted to help those who, like the lamprey, lack any jawbone at all. This kind of cosmetic surgery would in Smallweed's view do almost as much to redeem the lamprey's lacklustre image as anything planned in Chicago. </p> <p> <strong>The psychiatrist</strong> Raj Persaud and the Umist psychologist Cary Cooper had better watch out. Their claims to the title Mr Ubiquitous are about to fall to another. The psychologist Richard Wiseman of Hertfordshire University, who superintended the recent ghost-seeking experiment deep under Edinburgh castle, is the same Richard Wiseman recently in the news for flying to Las Vegas to investigate magicians' use of psychology, for probing reported sightings of Catherine Howard at Hampton Court and for staging a challenge in which a four-year-old child made a better fist of investing in the markets than a regular investor, an astrologer and a cat called Jasper. It was also Wiseman who, just before Christmas, attacted a cluster of headlines by claiming that banks had three main types of customer: hedonistic grazers (classic \"Bridget Jones\" types), material martyrs and steady builders. Persaud and Cooper should know that Wiseman has one important asset they haven't. He is a magician himself. </p> <p>Next week in Smallweed: Richard Wiseman invents a new classification for distinguishing between the behaviour of competing classes of lamprey. </p> <p><strong> The Friday night</strong> Channel 4 entertainment Frasier, which, apart from the news and sport, is just about the only thing I watch on television nowadays, has recently been disfigured by a subplot involving a Mancunian called Daphne, once some kind of carer/assistant to Frasier Crane's elderly father, but now attached to his brother, Niles. She has started guzzling chocolate and secreting other fattening products around the apartment to snaffle when no one is looking. This is making her amazingly fat. In a recent instalment, Daphne sank to the ground, and it needed the efforts of all three men to pull her back to her feet. This led to a line so sublime that it seemed at last to explain why this otherwise indefensible theme had been introduced. \"It has taken three Cranes to lift you!\" Frasier's father told her. That line having been spoken, there seemed to be no further need for the subplot, and I hoped it would now be dropped and Daphne returned to her slimline state. Sadly, it has persisted, which presumably means the more boring explanation - that the actor who plays her, Jane Leeves, is pregnant - was true all along, after all. </p> <p> <strong>Unattractive </strong>as the TV schedules often are, they are hardly more disappointing than the lists of films advertised by my local popcorn temples, from which everything I am keen to see is ruthlessly excluded. I have finally found a local cinema which is showing The Insider, a much-praised expos\u00e9 of the tobacco industry which could hardly have been more elusive had tobacco manufacturers bought all the copies up and suppressed them. I also caught up in that underestimated cultural centre, Croydon, with David Mamet's succulently well-written State and Main, which is not to everyone's taste but will enchant all those with distant memories of the 1940s comedy classic recently recollected here, Don't Take it to Heart. </p> <p> But few such movies linger for long, or even get shown at all, in such local cinemas as advertise in the London Evening Standard. The choice at present seems mainly to be between Bridget Jones's Diary (ABC Barbican, Odeon Marble Arch, UCI Whiteley's, Tricycle Cinema, UGC Ealing), Bridget Jones' Diary (Clapham Picture House, Gate Cinema, Ritzy Brixton, Screen on Baker Street, Screen on Islington Green, UGC Trocadero, Warner Village Finchley Road), Bridget Jones Diary (Odeon Camden Town, UGC West India Quay, UGC Staples Corner) and Bridget Jone's Diary (ABC Chelsea, Screen on the Hill, UCI Empire Leicester Square, UGC Hammersmith, and UGC Fulham Road). </p> <p>\u0095 Please note new email address: <a href=\"mailto:MrSmallweed@aol.com\">MrSmallweed@aol.com</a></p>",

Dr A Di Giulio and Dr D Di Giulio of Wimpole Street, it reveals, are offering safe implants for those with thin, low or hollow jawbones. Their methods could no doubt be swiftly adopted to help those who, like the lamprey, lack any jawbone at all. This kind of cosmetic surgery would in Smallweed's view do almost as much to redeem the lamprey's lacklustre image as anything planned in Chicago. The psychiatrist Raj Persaud and the Umist psychologist Cary Cooper had better watch out. Their claims to the title Mr Ubiquitous are about to fall to another. The psychologist Richard Wiseman of Hertfordshire University, who superintended the recent ghost-seeking experiment deep under Edinburgh castle, is the same Richard Wiseman recently in the news for flying to Las Vegas to investigate magicians' use of psychology, for probing reported sightings of Catherine Howard at Hampton Court and for staging a challenge in which a four-year-old child made a better fist of investing in the markets than a regular investor, an astrologer and a cat called Jasper. It was also Wiseman who, just before Christmas, attacted a cluster of headlines by claiming that banks had three main types of customer: hedonistic grazers (classic \"Bridget Jones\" types), material martyrs and steady builders. Persaud and Cooper should know that Wiseman has one important asset they haven't. He is a magician himself. Next week in Smallweed: Richard Wiseman invents a new classification for distinguishing between the behaviour of competing classes of lamprey. The Friday night Channel 4 entertainment Frasier, which, apart from the news and sport, is just about the only thing I watch on television nowadays, has recently been disfigured by a subplot involving a Mancunian called Daphne, once some kind of carer/assistant to Frasier Crane's elderly father, but now attached to his brother, Niles. She has started guzzling chocolate and secreting other fattening products around the apartment to snaffle when no one is looking. This is making her amazingly fat. In a recent instalment, Daphne sank to the ground, and it needed the efforts of all three men to pull her back to her feet. This led to a line so sublime that it seemed at last to explain why this otherwise indefensible theme had been introduced. \"It has taken three Cranes to lift you!\" Frasier's father told her. That line having been spoken, there seemed to be no further need for the subplot, and I hoped it would now be dropped and Daphne returned to her slimline state. Sadly, it has persisted, which presumably means the more boring explanation - that the actor who plays her, Jane Leeves, is pregnant - was true all along, after all. Unattractive as the TV schedules often are, they are hardly more disappointing than the lists of films advertised by my local popcorn temples, from which everything I am keen to see is ruthlessly excluded. I have finally found a local cinema which is showing The Insider, a much-praised expos\u00e9 of the tobacco industry which could hardly have been more elusive had tobacco manufacturers bought all the copies up and suppressed them. I also caught up in that underestimated cultural centre, Croydon, with David Mamet's succulently well-written State and Main, which is not to everyone's taste but will enchant all those with distant memories of the 1940s comedy classic recently recollected here, Don't Take it to Heart. But few such movies linger for long, or even get shown at all, in such local cinemas as advertise in the London Evening Standard. The choice at present seems mainly to be between Bridget Jones's Diary (ABC Barbican, Odeon Marble Arch, UCI Whiteley's, Tricycle Cinema, UGC Ealing), Bridget Jones' Diary (Clapham Picture House, Gate Cinema, Ritzy Brixton, Screen on Baker Street, Screen on Islington Green, UGC Trocadero, Warner Village Finchley Road), Bridget Jones Diary (Odeon Camden Town, UGC West India Quay, UGC Staples Corner) and Bridget Jone's Diary (ABC Chelsea, Screen on the Hill, UCI Empire Leicester Square, UGC Hammersmith, and UGC Fulham Road). \u0095 Please note new email address: MrSmallweed@aol.com",

That, needless to say, became awkward to translate. </p> <p>More than once I actually jumped when I heard people playfully bandying around the English term \"nigger\" offstage. But the real surprise was the 400-strong audience - who didn't turn a hair.

In the case of Love and Understanding's Greek version, about an hour and a half.

      "body": "<p>On a frosty Oxford morning, in the early spring of 1966, a New College porter crossed the main quad and unwittingly set in motion one of the most extraordinary debuts in modern British theatre. Earlier that term, a lanky undergraduate named Christopher Hampton, who had already earned a reputation on campus as a brilliant student of languages and who would graduate with a first-class honours degree in French and German, had submitted his first play to the annual Oxford University Dramatic Society student festival. </p> <p>A precocious exploration of the angst and self-laceration of adolescent homosexuality, written when he was only 18, When Did You Last See My Mother? had been accepted by OUDS, done decent business and even garnered a favourable review in the Guardian. On the advice of a friend, he had sent the script to Peggy Ramsay, the agent who had chaperoned the careers of such writers as Joe Orton, Robert Bolt and Edward Bond. About a week later, Hampton was pottering around his ground-floor rooms when the doorbell rang. </p> <p>\"I opened the door and there's this porter standing there, telling me that there is a telephone call for me,\" Hampton remembers. \"I immediately thought that someone had died because that was they only time they did this sort of thing. But, needless to say, it was only Peggy, who had browbeaten the poor man into submission over the phone. When I took the call, she said: 'You had better come down to London tomorrow. We have to decide what we are going to do about your play.' \" </p> <p>The next morning, Hampton cut his lectures and went to London, to Ramsay 's rundown office, in a converted brothel off St Martin's Lane. They hit it off almost instantly, the dynamic, overbearing Ramsay finding a favoured son in the intense young playwright, bookish-looking behind his NHS glasses. After treating Hampton to a graphic account of her affair with Ionesco, Ramsay picked up the phone and began to call through her check-list of outlets and venues. At the top was Bill Gaskill, then artistic director of the Royal Court theatre: \"She rang up in her very forceful way and said 'You have got to read this play',\" Gaskill recalls. \"Well, she was rather persuasive and quite formidable, so I did read it. And I liked it very much.\" </p> <p>Within three months, the play had progressed to the Royal Court's Theatre Upstairs. A month later it transferred to the Comedy Theatre, propelling the 20-year-old undergraduate into the theatrical history books as the youngest playwright in the modern era to have a production in the West End. To cement Hampton's Wunderkind status, the more delirious notices hailed the play as the most powerful and corrosive to grace any British stage since the war: \"I do not care whether Mr Hampton is 18 or 80,\" gushed the Times, \"There are things in his work that would be magnificently moving, beautifully understanding, revealing and compassionate for any age.\" </p> <p>The rapidity of his ascent left Hampton bemused, delighted and a little incredulous, as is obvious from his first major interview - with the Daily Mail - conducted on the day after the premiere, when Hampton revealed his ambition to be, one day, the West End's \"oldest playwright\" and to be accepted into the Acad\u00e9mie Francaise. \"I was saying all the wrong things in interviews; ie, the first thing that came into my head. So [the publicists] gave me a lady who went round with me. At one stage she gave me a bollocking because she said I didn't seem to realise how extraordinary it all was. And I said, 'What do you mean?' She said: 'People usually struggle for years and write 25 plays before they get this kind of attention.' Peggy had made it so easy.\" </p> <p>Thirty five years on, Hampton can look back at this early triumph across a career that has produced a body of work unparalleled in its depth and diversity. Though When Did You Last See My Mother? has now been largely overshadowed (it doesn't even make it into his collection, Plays 1, published by Faber in 1997) the success propelled Hampton to the much superior Total Eclipse, a dramatisation of the destructive relationship between the French poets Rimbaud and Verlaine; The Philanthropist, a spectacularly observed \"bourgeois comedy\" constructed as a riposte to Moli\u00e8re's Le Misanthrope; Tales From Hollywood, arguably Hampton's masterpiece, to be revived at the Donmar Warehouse on May 1 (previews start this week) and his best known stage work, Les Liaisons Dangereuses which was garlanded with honours, including an Olivier Award for play of the year in 1986, the Evening Standard Award of the same year and the New York Critics Circle Award in 1987. He went on to win an Oscar for his screenplay of the 1988 film version, which starred Glenn Close, John Malkovich and Michelle Pfeiffer. This week, it was announced that Steven Spielberg has hired him to write the screenplay for Tulip Fever, the film of the novel by Deborah Moggach. </p> <p>In addition to his original theatre work, Hampton has translated more than a dozen works for stage. These range from Tales from the Vienna Woods, by Odon Von Horvath whose repu- tation Hampton has done much to revive, to the extremely successful Art by Yasmina Reza, and her more recent Life x 3. Venturing even deeper into populist territory, he also co-wrote the libretto for Andrew Lloyd Webber's Sunset Boulevard and is currently working on a new musical, Dracula. </p> <p>While contemporaries such as Hare, Brenton, Frayn and Pinter have ploughed single furrows, Hampton has chosen to wander the length and breadth of his talent and interests. Unwilling to embrace political issues or explore the prevalent class conflicts, he is much less in tune with the British dramatic sensibility than with the 18th and 19th-century European writers who have been his main influences, particularly Flaubert with whom Hampton shares the same limpid objectivity and ironic outlook and tone. \"He is uncategorisable,\" says Richard Eyre, who directed Hampton's autobiographical work, White Chameleon at the National Theatre in 1993. \"To his credit, there is no school of Hampton, no loose confederation that you lump him together with. He has always been an absolute original. And his contribution in that sense is four or five really outstanding plays that are architecturally very, very sophisticated and have the denseness of poetry.\" </p> <p>By all accounts, Hampton has changed surprisingly little since that early success. Though he has filled out, he retains the boyish smile and gangly demeanour. If he appeared somewhat donnish as a young man, now, with his long mane of ash-grey hair, he looks even more so. There is a modest, gentle quality about him that seems out of its time. His considerable earnings allow him to live in a sumptuous Kensington mansion, each room decorated in a different period theme; the living room is \"19th-century Chinese\". </p> <p>His study is a vast, top-floor apartment in another, equally impressive white stucco mansion at the end of the same street. He is a staunch Luddite, flinches at the mention of the word \"e-mail\" and writes his plays and screenplays in longhand, with a fountain pen. </p> <p>Given his educational pedigree and the frame of reference of his work, it is not surprising that one of the first things people mention is his intelligence. But in person, there are no intellectual pyrotechnics, no linguistic fireworks. \"He doesn't wear it on his sleeve,\" says Don Black, who worked with him on the libretto of Sunset Boulevard. \"Obviously, his terms of reference are wide: he can quote Spinoza or Jung, or Pushkin, off the top of his head and is very well read. But he is down to earth. He fits in with anyone. He's as happy having a chat with the postman.\" </p> <p>He also possesses a strong streak of self-deprecating humour: \"All his comedy, and all his humour is about haplessness,\" says David Hare who was at school with him. \"Even at 13, 14, it was things going wrong that made him roar with laughter and that was what made other people roar with laughter. He is a brilliant anecdotist. He almost collects humiliation and mishaps, and out of that comedy he has often made his work.\" </p> <p>His college girlfriend Joanna Van Heyningen, now an architect, says: \"Chris was probably the most indecisive person I have ever come across. Not about his art, but about everything else in life. I used to go round to his mother's flat with him and his mother would say, 'Shall I turn on the television dear?' And Chris would say, 'I don't know, mother. It's up to you.' And she would say, 'No, it's up to you dear.' And he would say, 'No, it's up to you.' And it would go on like that. It was funny in an excruciating sort of way.\" </p> <p>Hampton adds: \"It's less of a problem now, but deciding which shoes to wear can still be a burden.\" </p> <p>His detachment from the world, where the literary figures that populate his imagination seem more tangible than the mortals before his eyes, can also be a barrier: \"He is very much a person of boundaries,\" says his wife, Laura. \"He has very strong boundaries and I think that people are initially loath to cross them. But then they realise what a very, very warm person he is. I think it's a writer's thing, this remoteness. That is my only problem with him. He is very remote.\" </p> <p>It is a character trait of which Hampton is aware: \"I do feel that kind of distance. Just because, from Suez on, my childhood was characterised by a certain amount of ups and downs, it doesn't surprise me that life has continued in that manner. I view things with a certain equanimity.\" </p> <p>Christopher James Hampton was born on January 26 1946 in the Azores archipelago, in the north Atlantic ocean 1,000 miles off the coast of Portugal, where his father was stationed as an engineer with Cable and Wireless. Before Christopher's second birthday, the family was posted first to Aden - \"A dreadful place, a bit like hell\" - and then to Alexandria, \"my father's favourite\". The latter would provide the setting for his 1991 play White Chameleon, as well as much of the material: the attempt by \"ferocious\" nuns to force the boy to write with his right hand; and the portrait of a bookish, rather effete, bespectacled child. \"He always had glasses, round National Health glasses,\" recalls his brother, Bob, an accountant. \"And he learned to read at an incredibly young age by sitting on his father's knee and demanding to be read to.\" </p> <p>In 1956, as the Suez crisis developed, the family was forced to flee Alexandria under cover of darkness, leaving everything behind: \"We went to Port Said and there was a liner passing en route from Australia to London,\" Hampton recalls. \"It stopped and we got a launch out and went up the side. It was great, very exciting for a 10-year-old.\" However, during future postings to Hong Kong and Zanzibar, the young Christopher was left at boarding school in England, first a prep school in Reigate and then Lancing College, a public school: \"I loved Egypt. Then when I came back to England where I didn't love it at all, I found it very hard to settle.\" </p> <p>However, at Lancing, Hampton proved to be an academic powerhouse: \"He was quite simply one of the most brilliant students I ever taught,\" says his French tutor, Harry Guest. Hampton's background set him apart: \"Most of us came from Surrey or Sussex,\" remembers a school-friend, Roger Dancey, now a schoolmaster at George V School in Birmingham. \"And here was this bloom from another world who went home for the holidays to Zanzibar.\" </p> <p>He seemed more mature than some: \"He had an inner core of certainty and was very calm inside, even as young boy,\" Hare recalls, \"He was preternaturally adult.\" </p> <p>At Lancing, Christopher had his first sexual experiences, most of them homosexual: \"It was more romantic than anything else,\" he says. \"And the strange thing was that in the holidays you were off trying to find a girlfriend.\" </p> <p>His creative impulses also began to blossom. He acted in a number of school productions, including a mammoth production of Goethe's Iphigenie auf Tauris in German, in which he played the lead role of Princess Iphigenie: \"Hampton used a subdued brooding presence that suited the greater part of his role and he delivered his lines very well indeed,\" the school magazine records. He also wrote poetry for the magazine, some of which made its way into an anthology of public- school verse, but his main creative endeavour during this period was a novel, Harry Stone, written in the form of a 300-page suicide note: \"It was all fantastically Gothic and gloomy,\" he says. \"The last pages were written as he died after he slashed his wrists.\" </p> <p>Earning a fine crop of rejection slips, the novel was never published, due to a fire at Ramsay's office: \"There is good news and there is bad news,\" she told him, breaking the news. \"The bad news is that a lot of my archive has been destroyed but the good news is that I think your novel went up as well.\" </p> <p>While waiting to take up his place at Oxford, he lived with his brother and friends in Earl's Court in London, and began work on When Did you Last See My Mother? . \"We weren't aware of it,\" says Bob Hampton, \"and I don't think I knew it was written there until after it was performed. He stayed in the flat while the rest of us went out to work. I presumed he was lying around in bed.\" </p> <p>In 1965, Christopher went up to Oxford, where he chose to study languages rather than English literature. During his first year, his father died of a stroke: \"It was so sudden. He had just retired. So much of my life I hadn't seen him. And I had been looking forward to spending more time with him.\" </p> <p>When he returned for his second year, Christopher threw himself into the college dramatic society. About this time, he also met Van Heyningen, the daughter of an Oxford don, with whom he was to have a relationship throughout most of his college years: \"He was lanky, his skin wasn't that brilliant,\" she says. \"He wasn't obviously much of a catch except when you heard him speak and then he has got a wonderful voice - that was the thing that was so attractive about him. Also, he was so terribly funny.\" </p> <p>This was Hampton's first serious heterosexual relationship: \"Most of his experiences before me had been homosexual,\" Van Heyningen says, \"So I was quite early on in that side of things.He was thinking that he was almost certainly heterosexual.\" </p> <p>Much of this experience had been poured into When Did You Last See My Mother?. After the huge success of the play at the Royal Court and in the West End, Hampton returned again to a homosexual subject for Total Eclipse, which dealt with the destructive relationship between Rimbaud and Verlaine, and also explored the nature of creativity and genius. </p> <p>The play was written during a study year abroad which began inauspiciously in Hamburg: \"It was the only time I remember being really depressed,\" he recalls. \"I was 21. I had no friends. And I was dealing with what had happened with When Did You Last See My Mother? and what seemed to me unmerited success.\" </p> <p>When he discovered that the Schauspielhaus, where he was employed as assistant dramaturg, was not willing to pay him, he fled to Paris, finishing the play there before returning to Oxford in the autumn: \"Bill Gaskill and Bob Kidd [who had directed When Did you Last See My Mother? ] turned up in my rooms and asked me to read Total Eclipse to them. There were only two chairs. Bill took the large, comfortable chair and Bob took the small chair and I lay on the bed and read them the play. At the end, Bill said: 'Well, I think we'll do it.' Whereupon they left and they did it. It opened the September after I graduated.\" </p> <p>Total Eclipse received mixed reviews, (it would do much better when revived in 1981, and was eventually made into a film with Leonardo DiCaprio) but by now Hampton was being accepted as one of the Royal Court writers. When he graduated he was offered the job of literary manager, as well as becoming its first writer-in-residence. \"They paid me a pittance and I remember my office was so small that if there were more than two at the meeting, we would have to stand up. I went back recently and noticed that it had been torn down and replaced with a bench.\" </p> <p>It was around this time that Hampton met his wife, Laura d'Holesch, a social worker and nurse, who was his landlady in Earl's Court. She had a similarly nomadic background (her father, a Hungarian aristocrat, and mother, a concert pianist, roved from Bucharest to Paris to New York). A relationship developed: \"Christopher became my tenant when I lived in a completely horrendous basement in Earl's Court,\" she remembers. \"He was much more self-effacing back then, very unsure of himself. Very, very quiet. I was very impressed not because he had a play on at the Royal Court - Total Eclipse was about to open - but because he had got a first at Oxford. I thought that was completely wonderful.\" </p> <p>They went on to marry three years later and now have two daughters. Alice, 26, is training to be a Montessori teacher and Mary, 24, studied music but is now training to be a cabinet-maker. </p> <p>In his early days at the Royal Court, Hampton began to mix closely with the theatre's hellraising, hard-drinking clique, prominent members of which included the actor Victor Henry, who had been in When Did You Last See My Mother? and Total Eclipse, and Bob Kidd. (Both died young, Henry the victim of a hit-and-run accident aged 29 and Kidd at 37 from pancreatitis.) \"I don't think I drank as much as the others, but I kept up,\" says Hampton. \"My doctor tells me that my liver is not what it might be.\" </p> <p>His next play, staged at the Royal Court in 1970, would prove so out of synch with the spirit of the times that the theatre hesitated over it for two years. The Philanthropist examines the empty life of a group of college intellectuals. Most memorable is the central character, obviously based on Hampton himself, an anti-hero whose affable nature is as inflammatory to the people around him as is the confrontational malice of Moli\u00e8re's Le Misanthrope. The play proved to be the Royal Court's most successful production to that date, and transferred to the West End for a three-year run: \"That didn't go down well,\" Hampton says. \"The Court was much more comfortable with failure than with success so, when I left that year, I left under something of a cloud.\" </p> <p>However, he would more than make up for his success with his next two works: Savages, produced in 1973, was inspired by Norman Lewis's famous article, Genocide in Brazil, and received lukewarm notices, and Treats (1976), an airless treatment of a three-way relationship. Perversely, he savoured the scathing reviews: \"That is the most extraordinary side of him,\" says Laura: \"He enjoyed it. I said: 'Christopher, are you some sort of masochist?' And he said: 'This is real.'\" </p> <p>In any case, Hampton was considering a concerted move away from the theatre, which he felt was growing too partisan: \"His instincts are the instincts of an anarchist not of a socialist,\" says Hare, \"He didn't feel part of the dominant theatre movement of the time because it was all very leftwing and very politically motivated.\" </p> <p>Instead, Hampton decamped to Hollywood, where he began work on a film about Dora Carrington, the bisexual Bloomsbury painter and companion of Lytton Strachey. He was also employed to write a screenplay of Nostromo with David Lean, until the director lost interest and abandoned the project. One Hollywood producer asked him to adapt Marlowe's Edward II, only to have the script flung back in his face with the comment: \"You wouldn't even get this damn thing on TV.\" </p> <p>Though the diversion into film would prove unproductive in the short term (Carrington, which one producer's wife described to Hampton as a film \"about a lot of pissy English people\" took almost 20 years to reach the screen), events in Los Angeles did provide the material for Tales from Hollywood. The play traces the adventures of a group of displaced European wartime exiles in Hollywood, including Brecht, Heinrich and Thomas Mann. Produced at the National Theatre in 1980, it was a popular success and reviewed more favourably than any of his plays since The Philanthropist. </p> <p>However, Hampton's greatest critical triumph was still to come. For some years, Ramsay had been nagging him to write an adaptation of Les Liaisons Dangereuses, Choderlos de Laclos's story of love and savagery. However, the National was reluctant to tackle an 18th-century epistolary novel, assuming it would be box-office poison. \"I thought that it was impossible,\" says Howard Davies, who directed the play. \"His response was, 'Well, fuck you', which seemed to goad him into action. It was such a negative spur. He delivered the script and it captivated me immediately... It was so simple and cruel, and so shocking.\" </p> <p> The resulting production, in 1984, with Alan Rickman as Valmont and Lesley Duncan as Merteuil, was an international sensation, winning a clutch of awards and transferring to Broadway. The film adaptation, directed by Stephen Frears and released in 1988, was nominated for seven Academy awards and won three, including one for Hampton's screenplay. </p> <p>In many ways, this success has somewhat derailed his career: \"I then thought that [making films] might get easier. For the first time I was bombarded with offers. But it didn't [get easier] and I didn't get a film made for five more years.\" </p> <p>However, while his bottom drawer bulges with imminent scripts (16 at last count, including the current Tulip Fever) his passion for film has opened up a new career path. When director Mike Newell dropped out of Carrington, Hampton was persuaded to take over: \"He loved it so much,\" says Emma Thompson, who played the lead role. \"You mustn't discount the fact that Chris has his own magnetism. His quietness and tolerance brought us all towards him. It was all quite hassle-free, which is unusual for a first-time director.\" </p> <p>The film earned Hampton a special jury prize at the Cannes film festival in 1995. </p> <p>Only one new Hampton play has been produced in the theatre since Les Liaisons Dangereuses, the autobiographical White Chameleon in 1991. But his work has reached the public through translations such as Art. \"I miss him,\" says David Hare. \"We lost Christopher to the cinema, and only to get him through the voice of Yasmina Reza is a great deprivation. I find it very strange, his role as the amanuensis for a playwright who isn't one tenth as good as he is.\" </p> <p>Hampton, in his defence, pleads his overriding love of cinema, ignited in the tiny movie theatres of Alexandria and then nourished at the Lancing European film club. His willingness to put his talents at the service of others he puts down to his very European aspiration to be a \"working playwright\", of which Moli\u00e8re was probably the greatest example. But projects on the horizon promise a Hampton renaissance. With Tales from Hollywood at the Donmar Warehouse, he will have three productions on London stages, (albeit two via translations). His adaptation of The Quiet American, directed by Phillip Noyce, is being filmed in Vietnam, and a new original play dealing with the troubled relationship between Jung and Freud, is pencilled in at the National for the end of the year. </p> <p>\"I seem to have turned into something of a workaholic,\" he says, recalling his youthful ambition to be the West End's oldest playwright. \"When I was younger, Peggy Ramsay used to ring me up at eight o' clock in the morning warning me to get out of bed and work. She thought I was very idle. Now I have to force myself to stop.\" </p> <p><strong> Life at a glance:</strong> Christopher James Hampton </p> <p><strong>Born: </strong> January 26 1948, Azores </p> <p><strong> Education: </strong> Reigate Prep School 1956-59, Lancing College 1959-63, Oxford 1964-68. </p> <p><strong> Married: </strong> Laura d'Holesch 1971; two daughters, Alice and Mary. </p> <p><strong> Plays:</strong> When Did You Last See My Mother? 1966, Total Eclipse 1968, The Philanthropist 1970, Savages 1973, Treats 1976, Tales From Hollywood 1982, Les Liaisons Dangereuses 1985, White Chameleon 1991. </p> <p><strong> Some films and TV: </strong> The Quiet American 2001, Carrington 1995, Tales from Hollywood 1992, Dangerous Liaisons 1988, The Good Father, 1987, Hotel du Lac 1986, The Honorary Consul, 1983, The History Man, 1981. </p> <p><strong> Some awards: </strong> For Tales From Hollywood, Evening Standard best comedy award, 1982; for Les Liaisons Dangereuses, London Theatre Critics best play award 1985, Laurence Olivier play of the year award,1986, Evening Standard award 1986, New York Critics Circle best foreign play 1987; for Dangerous Liaisons, Oscar for best screenplay adapted from another medium, 1989.</p>",

      "bodyText": "On a frosty Oxford morning, in the early spring of 1966, a New College porter crossed the main quad and unwittingly set in motion one of the most extraordinary debuts in modern British theatre. Earlier that term, a lanky undergraduate named Christopher Hampton, who had already earned a reputation on campus as a brilliant student of languages and who would graduate with a first-class honours degree in French and German, had submitted his first play to the annual Oxford University Dramatic Society student festival. A precocious exploration of the angst and self-laceration of adolescent homosexuality, written when he was only 18, When Did You Last See My Mother? had been accepted by OUDS, done decent business and even garnered a favourable review in the Guardian. On the advice of a friend, he had sent the script to Peggy Ramsay, the agent who had chaperoned the careers of such writers as Joe Orton, Robert Bolt and Edward Bond. About a week later, Hampton was pottering around his ground-floor rooms when the doorbell rang. \"I opened the door and there's this porter standing there, telling me that there is a telephone call for me,\" Hampton remembers. \"I immediately thought that someone had died because that was they only time they did this sort of thing. But, needless to say, it was only Peggy, who had browbeaten the poor man into submission over the phone. When I took the call, she said: 'You had better come down to London tomorrow. We have to decide what we are going to do about your play.' \" The next morning, Hampton cut his lectures and went to London, to Ramsay 's rundown office, in a converted brothel off St Martin's Lane. They hit it off almost instantly, the dynamic, overbearing Ramsay finding a favoured son in the intense young playwright, bookish-looking behind his NHS glasses. After treating Hampton to a graphic account of her affair with Ionesco, Ramsay picked up the phone and began to call through her check-list of outlets and venues. At the top was Bill Gaskill, then artistic director of the Royal Court theatre: \"She rang up in her very forceful way and said 'You have got to read this play',\" Gaskill recalls. \"Well, she was rather persuasive and quite formidable, so I did read it. And I liked it very much.\" Within three months, the play had progressed to the Royal Court's Theatre Upstairs. A month later it transferred to the Comedy Theatre, propelling the 20-year-old undergraduate into the theatrical history books as the youngest playwright in the modern era to have a production in the West End. To cement Hampton's Wunderkind status, the more delirious notices hailed the play as the most powerful and corrosive to grace any British stage since the war: \"I do not care whether Mr Hampton is 18 or 80,\" gushed the Times, \"There are things in his work that would be magnificently moving, beautifully understanding, revealing and compassionate for any age.\" The rapidity of his ascent left Hampton bemused, delighted and a little incredulous, as is obvious from his first major interview - with the Daily Mail - conducted on the day after the premiere, when Hampton revealed his ambition to be, one day, the West End's \"oldest playwright\" and to be accepted into the Acad\u00e9mie Francaise. \"I was saying all the wrong things in interviews; ie, the first thing that came into my head. So [the publicists] gave me a lady who went round with me. At one stage she gave me a bollocking because she said I didn't seem to realise how extraordinary it all was. And I said, 'What do you mean?' She said: 'People usually struggle for years and write 25 plays before they get this kind of attention.' Peggy had made it so easy.\" Thirty five years on, Hampton can look back at this early triumph across a career that has produced a body of work unparalleled in its depth and diversity. Though When Did You Last See My Mother? has now been largely overshadowed (it doesn't even make it into his collection, Plays 1, published by Faber in 1997) the success propelled Hampton to the much superior Total Eclipse, a dramatisation of the destructive relationship between the French poets Rimbaud and Verlaine; The Philanthropist, a spectacularly observed \"bourgeois comedy\" constructed as a riposte to Moli\u00e8re's Le Misanthrope; Tales From Hollywood, arguably Hampton's masterpiece, to be revived at the Donmar Warehouse on May 1 (previews start this week) and his best known stage work, Les Liaisons Dangereuses which was garlanded with honours, including an Olivier Award for play of the year in 1986, the Evening Standard Award of the same year and the New York Critics Circle Award in 1987. He went on to win an Oscar for his screenplay of the 1988 film version, which starred Glenn Close, John Malkovich and Michelle Pfeiffer. This week, it was announced that Steven Spielberg has hired him to write the screenplay for Tulip Fever, the film of the novel by Deborah Moggach. In addition to his original theatre work, Hampton has translated more than a dozen works for stage. These range from Tales from the Vienna Woods, by Odon Von Horvath whose repu- tation Hampton has done much to revive, to the extremely successful Art by Yasmina Reza, and her more recent Life x 3. Venturing even deeper into populist territory, he also co-wrote the libretto for Andrew Lloyd Webber's Sunset Boulevard and is currently working on a new musical, Dracula. While contemporaries such as Hare, Brenton, Frayn and Pinter have ploughed single furrows, Hampton has chosen to wander the length and breadth of his talent and interests. Unwilling to embrace political issues or explore the prevalent class conflicts, he is much less in tune with the British dramatic sensibility than with the 18th and 19th-century European writers who have been his main influences, particularly Flaubert with whom Hampton shares the same limpid objectivity and ironic outlook and tone. \"He is uncategorisable,\" says Richard Eyre, who directed Hampton's autobiographical work, White Chameleon at the National Theatre in 1993. \"To his credit, there is no school of Hampton, no loose confederation that you lump him together with. He has always been an absolute original. And his contribution in that sense is four or five really outstanding plays that are architecturally very, very sophisticated and have the denseness of poetry.\" By all accounts, Hampton has changed surprisingly little since that early success. Though he has filled out, he retains the boyish smile and gangly demeanour. If he appeared somewhat donnish as a young man, now, with his long mane of ash-grey hair, he looks even more so. There is a modest, gentle quality about him that seems out of its time. His considerable earnings allow him to live in a sumptuous Kensington mansion, each room decorated in a different period theme; the living room is \"19th-century Chinese\". His study is a vast, top-floor apartment in another, equally impressive white stucco mansion at the end of the same street. He is a staunch Luddite, flinches at the mention of the word \"e-mail\" and writes his plays and screenplays in longhand, with a fountain pen. Given his educational pedigree and the frame of reference of his work, it is not surprising that one of the first things people mention is his intelligence. But in person, there are no intellectual pyrotechnics, no linguistic fireworks. \"He doesn't wear it on his sleeve,\" says Don Black, who worked with him on the libretto of Sunset Boulevard. \"Obviously, his terms of reference are wide: he can quote Spinoza or Jung, or Pushkin, off the top of his head and is very well read.

It was funny in an excruciating sort of way.\" Hampton adds: \"It's less of a problem now, but deciding which shoes to wear can still be a burden.\" His detachment from the world, where the literary figures that populate his imagination seem more tangible than the mortals before his eyes, can also be a barrier: \"He is very much a person of boundaries,\" says his wife, Laura. \"He has very strong boundaries and I think that people are initially loath to cross them.

Then when I came back to England where I didn't love it at all, I found it very hard to settle.\" However, at Lancing, Hampton proved to be an academic powerhouse: \"He was quite simply one of the most brilliant students I ever taught,\" says his French tutor, Harry Guest. Hampton's background set him apart: \"Most of us came from Surrey or Sussex,\" remembers a school-friend, Roger Dancey, now a schoolmaster at George V School in Birmingham. \"And here was this bloom from another world who went home for the holidays to Zanzibar.\" He seemed more mature than some: \"He had an inner core of certainty and was very calm inside, even as young boy,\" Hare recalls, \"He was preternaturally adult.\" At Lancing, Christopher had his first sexual experiences, most of them homosexual: \"It was more romantic than anything else,\" he says. \"And the strange thing was that in the holidays you were off trying to find a girlfriend.\" His creative impulses also began to blossom. He acted in a number of school productions, including a mammoth production of Goethe's Iphigenie auf Tauris in German, in which he played the lead role of Princess Iphigenie: \"Hampton used a subdued brooding presence that suited the greater part of his role and he delivered his lines very well indeed,\" the school magazine records. He also wrote poetry for the magazine, some of which made its way into an anthology of public- school verse, but his main creative endeavour during this period was a novel, Harry Stone, written in the form of a 300-page suicide note: \"It was all fantastically Gothic and gloomy,\" he says. \"The last pages were written as he died after he slashed his wrists.\" Earning a fine crop of rejection slips, the novel was never published, due to a fire at Ramsay's office: \"There is good news and there is bad news,\" she told him, breaking the news. \"The bad news is that a lot of my archive has been destroyed but the good news is that I think your novel went up as well.\" While waiting to take up his place at Oxford, he lived with his brother and friends in Earl's Court in London, and began work on When Did you Last See My Mother? . \"We weren't aware of it,\" says Bob Hampton, \"and I don't think I knew it was written there until after it was performed. He stayed in the flat while the rest of us went out to work. I presumed he was lying around in bed.\" In 1965, Christopher went up to Oxford, where he chose to study languages rather than English literature. During his first year, his father died of a stroke: \"It was so sudden. He had just retired. So much of my life I hadn't seen him. And I had been looking forward to spending more time with him.\" When he returned for his second year, Christopher threw himself into the college dramatic society. About this time, he also met Van Heyningen, the daughter of an Oxford don, with whom he was to have a relationship throughout most of his college years: \"He was lanky, his skin wasn't that brilliant,\" she says. \"He wasn't obviously much of a catch except when you heard him speak and then he has got a wonderful voice - that was the thing that was so attractive about him. Also, he was so terribly funny.\" This was Hampton's first serious heterosexual relationship: \"Most of his experiences before me had been homosexual,\" Van Heyningen says, \"So I was quite early on in that side of things.He was thinking that he was almost certainly heterosexual.\" Much of this experience had been poured into When Did You Last See My Mother?. After the huge success of the play at the Royal Court and in the West End, Hampton returned again to a homosexual subject for Total Eclipse, which dealt with the destructive relationship between Rimbaud and Verlaine, and also explored the nature of creativity and genius. The play was written during a study year abroad which began inauspiciously in Hamburg: \"It was the only time I remember being really depressed,\" he recalls. \"I was 21. I had no friends. And I was dealing with what had happened with When Did You Last See My Mother? and what seemed to me unmerited success.\" When he discovered that the Schauspielhaus, where he was employed as assistant dramaturg, was not willing to pay him, he fled to Paris, finishing the play there before returning to Oxford in the autumn: \"Bill Gaskill and Bob Kidd [who had directed When Did you Last See My Mother? ] turned up in my rooms and asked me to read Total Eclipse to them. There were only two chairs. Bill took the large, comfortable chair and Bob took the small chair and I lay on the bed and read them the play. At the end, Bill said: 'Well, I think we'll do it.' Whereupon they left and they did it. It opened the September after I graduated.\" Total Eclipse received mixed reviews, (it would do much better when revived in 1981, and was eventually made into a film with Leonardo DiCaprio) but by now Hampton was being accepted as one of the Royal Court writers. When he graduated he was offered the job of literary manager, as well as becoming its first writer-in-residence. \"They paid me a pittance and I remember my office was so small that if there were more than two at the meeting, we would have to stand up. I went back recently and noticed that it had been torn down and replaced with a bench.\" It was around this time that Hampton met his wife, Laura d'Holesch, a social worker and nurse, who was his landlady in Earl's Court. She had a similarly nomadic background (her father, a Hungarian aristocrat, and mother, a concert pianist, roved from Bucharest to Paris to New York). A relationship developed: \"Christopher became my tenant when I lived in a completely horrendous basement in Earl's Court,\" she remembers. \"He was much more self-effacing back then, very unsure of himself. Very, very quiet. I was very impressed not because he had a play on at the Royal Court - Total Eclipse was about to open - but because he had got a first at Oxford. I thought that was completely wonderful.\" They went on to marry three years later and now have two daughters. Alice, 26, is training to be a Montessori teacher and Mary, 24, studied music but is now training to be a cabinet-maker. In his early days at the Royal Court, Hampton began to mix closely with the theatre's hellraising, hard-drinking clique, prominent members of which included the actor Victor Henry, who had been in When Did You Last See My Mother? and Total Eclipse, and Bob Kidd. (Both died young, Henry the victim of a hit-and-run accident aged 29 and Kidd at 37 from pancreatitis.) \"I don't think I drank as much as the others, but I kept up,\" says Hampton. \"My doctor tells me that my liver is not what it might be.\" His next play, staged at the Royal Court in 1970, would prove so out of synch with the spirit of the times that the theatre hesitated over it for two years. The Philanthropist examines the empty life of a group of college intellectuals. Most memorable is the central character, obviously based on Hampton himself, an anti-hero whose affable nature is as inflammatory to the people around him as is the confrontational malice of Moli\u00e8re's Le Misanthrope. The play proved to be the Royal Court's most successful production to that date, and transferred to the West End for a three-year run: \"That didn't go down well,\" Hampton says. \"The Court was much more comfortable with failure than with success so, when I left that year, I left under something of a cloud.\" However, he would more than make up for his success with his next two works: Savages, produced in 1973, was inspired by Norman Lewis's famous article, Genocide in Brazil, and received lukewarm notices, and Treats (1976), an airless treatment of a three-way relationship. Perversely, he savoured the scathing reviews: \"That is the most extraordinary side of him,\" says Laura: \"He enjoyed it. I said: 'Christopher, are you some sort of masochist?' And he said: 'This is real.'\" In any case, Hampton was considering a concerted move away from the theatre, which he felt was growing too partisan: \"His instincts are the instincts of an anarchist not of a socialist,\" says Hare, \"He didn't feel part of the dominant theatre movement of the time because it was all very leftwing and very politically motivated.\" Instead, Hampton decamped to Hollywood, where he began work on a film about Dora Carrington, the bisexual Bloomsbury painter and companion of Lytton Strachey. He was also employed to write a screenplay of Nostromo with David Lean, until the director lost interest and abandoned the project. One Hollywood producer asked him to adapt Marlowe's Edward II, only to have the script flung back in his face with the comment: \"You wouldn't even get this damn thing on TV.\" Though the diversion into film would prove unproductive in the short term (Carrington, which one producer's wife described to Hampton as a film \"about a lot of pissy English people\" took almost 20 years to reach the screen), events in Los Angeles did provide the material for Tales from Hollywood. The play traces the adventures of a group of displaced European wartime exiles in Hollywood, including Brecht, Heinrich and Thomas Mann. Produced at the National Theatre in 1980, it was a popular success and reviewed more favourably than any of his plays since The Philanthropist. However, Hampton's greatest critical triumph was still to come. For some years, Ramsay had been nagging him to write an adaptation of Les Liaisons Dangereuses, Choderlos de Laclos's story of love and savagery. However, the National was reluctant to tackle an 18th-century epistolary novel, assuming it would be box-office poison. \"I thought that it was impossible,\" says Howard Davies, who directed the play. \"His response was, 'Well, fuck you', which seemed to goad him into action. It was such a negative spur. He delivered the script and it captivated me immediately... It was so simple and cruel, and so shocking.\" The resulting production, in 1984, with Alan Rickman as Valmont and Lesley Duncan as Merteuil, was an international sensation, winning a clutch of awards and transferring to Broadway. The film adaptation, directed by Stephen Frears and released in 1988, was nominated for seven Academy awards and won three, including one for Hampton's screenplay. In many ways, this success has somewhat derailed his career: \"I then thought that [making films] might get easier. For the first time I was bombarded with offers. But it didn't [get easier] and I didn't get a film made for five more years.\" However, while his bottom drawer bulges with imminent scripts (16 at last count, including the current Tulip Fever) his passion for film has opened up a new career path. When director Mike Newell dropped out of Carrington, Hampton was persuaded to take over: \"He loved it so much,\" says Emma Thompson, who played the lead role. \"You mustn't discount the fact that Chris has his own magnetism. His quietness and tolerance brought us all towards him. It was all quite hassle-free, which is unusual for a first-time director.\" The film earned Hampton a special jury prize at the Cannes film festival in 1995. Only one new Hampton play has been produced in the theatre since Les Liaisons Dangereuses, the autobiographical White Chameleon in 1991. But his work has reached the public through translations such as Art. \"I miss him,\" says David Hare. \"We lost Christopher to the cinema, and only to get him through the voice of Yasmina Reza is a great deprivation. I find it very strange, his role as the amanuensis for a playwright who isn't one tenth as good as he is.\" Hampton, in his defence, pleads his overriding love of cinema, ignited in the tiny movie theatres of Alexandria and then nourished at the Lancing European film club. His willingness to put his talents at the service of others he puts down to his very European aspiration to be a \"working playwright\", of which Moli\u00e8re was probably the greatest example. But projects on the horizon promise a Hampton renaissance. With Tales from Hollywood at the Donmar Warehouse, he will have three productions on London stages, (albeit two via translations). His adaptation of The Quiet American, directed by Phillip Noyce, is being filmed in Vietnam, and a new original play dealing with the troubled relationship between Jung and Freud, is pencilled in at the National for the end of the year. \"I seem to have turned into something of a workaholic,\" he says, recalling his youthful ambition to be the West End's oldest playwright. \"When I was younger, Peggy Ramsay used to ring me up at eight o' clock in the morning warning me to get out of bed and work. She thought I was very idle. Now I have to force myself to stop.\" Life at a glance: Christopher James Hampton Born: January 26 1948, Azores Education: Reigate Prep School 1956-59, Lancing College 1959-63, Oxford 1964-68.

The Shock of the New by Robert Hughes long ago convinced me that where modern art is concerned, I require context. </p> <p>On my first visit to Tate Modern a year ago, I found myself overwhelmed, first by the huge and wonderful space and second by the bewildering way the contents are displayed. This is, in artspeak, \"the hang\". The idea is that you wander from gallery to gallery and look at works of art connected in a way determined by the directors. So you get Richard Long and Claude Monet in the same room. You are supposed to make a connection between Long's slate and Monet's water lilies. Both are natural objects, and both have some red in them. I think this is the rationale, but to be frank, I couldn't care less. </p> <p>So on my second visit this week, it seemed a good idea to listen to the experts as a means of getting my artistic bearings. Mark Rothko is in the gallery on level 3 west, entitled Landscape/Matter/ Environment. You might think that this covers almost every known form of creation, but you would not have made allowances for the sententious language of art galleries. Nittve thinks that the Rothkos are very glamorous, colourful, restful and beautifully displayed. And? And that's about it. </p> <p>Salvador Dali's Lobster Telephone, 1936, on level 3 east (Still Life/Object/Real Life), suggests to him that there is more to Dali than he once thought. The art establishment has turned against Dali, but Nittve can perceive some virtues in his technique. No mention of Dali's playfulness or perversity. As for Piet Mondrian, Composition B with Red, 1935, level 5 west, History/Memory/Society, Nittve thinks they are very sexual. Apparently Mondrian loved to talk about sex. </p> <p>I will spare you the other 16 highlights. I once saw a film about Mondrian which suggested that his painting had something to do with the patterns of tulip fields. I was puzzled. A few minutes' research at the London Library told me that Mondrian was interested in the triumph of science and theosophy. No mention of tulips or sex. </p> <p>He believed, as the theosophists did, that evolution would lead to an ultimate revelation, which would balance opposing forms. He tried to explore this idea in his painting. He said: \"The totality of the picture surface has become the picture's very image; we are not looking at imagery within a picture, but rather viewing the entire surface itself, as imagery.\" </p> <p>When Mondrian began to paint, before the first world war, the landscape of society was very different. Abstract painting had a context far removed from the Upper East Side, or Tate Modern. It was a serious, if opaque, attempt to come to terms with the emerging world. Rothko wanted to develop abstractionism, to include elements of surrealism, the sublime and the primitive, in keeping with the vastness of the west and the realisation that Native American art was peculiarly American. </p> <p>It is true, of course, that even people who love abstract painting find it hard to discuss its meaning. It does not yield to naturalistic assumptions; indeed Rothko denied that there was any particular visual experience in his painting. But for all that, it is illuminating to know what ideas link or divide groups and movements of artists, what the historical context was and what developments took place in artist's careers and perceptions. </p> <p>The way Tate Modern is hung, none of this is possible. Instead you have to follow the thin and patronising themes decided for you. I was suddenly reminded of the sneering comparisons made at the time between Tate Modern and the Dome. </p> <p> I went to see Simon Gray's play, Japes, as it was nearing the end of its run. It is a story about two brothers, one a charming drunk, without whom the hero and his wife cannot live. It is at times harrowing and often very funny. As the reviewers have said, the acting from Toby Stephens, Jasper Britton and Clare Swinburne is sensational. But the Theatre Royal was less than half full. I wondered if foot and mouth was keeping away Americans or whether the bleakness of the play was the reason. Plays don't come much darker. </p> <p>Don't read on if you plan to go. Mikey, a writer, betrays his own brother, Japes, by stifling his own literary career. But Japes in turn betrays his brother by sleeping with his wife Anita and probably fathering their daughter. </p> <p>This is a m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois so destructive that Gray finishes it off with a double suicide, which unfortunately causes the play to destruct in sympathy. But what he captures so well is the false relations between brothers: the unspoken rivalries, the hidden slights, the half- forgotten incidents, sudden resentments and, above all, the question of success. </p> <p>Brothers have constantly to evaluate themselves against each other. It's a familiar theme, particularly in America, where Philip Roth's Zuckerman brothers are masters of the art of brotherly treachery, and where countless films and novels pose the question of which brother possesses the heroic human qualities. </p> <p>Yet in real life, brothers are obliged to maintain a cheery camaraderie. They are always reminding themselves of the golden moments of brotherhood - past, of course. If we are to believe Christina Rossetti, sisters are different: \"There is no friend like a sister, in calm or stormy weather.\" I have never had a sister, so I am prepared to believe it. </p> <p> Welcome Msomi's wonderful Zulu Macbeth returns to the Globe. In Johannesburg five years ago, I went to the opening night. Traditional Zulus were regarded with suspicion by the urbanites - it was the height of the ANC-Inkatha battles - and the sight of 150 Zulus in full tribal dress on their way to the theatre summoned the spectre of Rorke's Drift.

      "body": "<p>If there was ever a good intention on the road to Hell, it was that of Robert Moon, who has died at the age of 83. His laudable aim, in which he succeeded brilliantly, was to speed the delivery of America's mail. But his deceptively simple scheme rapidly turned the demographic world on its head, brought unheard-of refinement to social discrimination, and unleashed an ever-growing mountain of junk mail. Moon was the man who invented the nationwide postal code.</p> <p>For the first 50 years of the 20th century, Americans used the post mainly for social letters, carried across the country on 10,000 mail trains and sorted in transit. By the late 1950s, however, two simultaneous developments were bringing the system to its knees. The railways were in precipitate decline, and equipment had been invented which enabled businesses to generate personalised mass mailings. Suddenly millions of pension cheques, electricity bills and mortgage payments arrived by post. By the early 1960s they accounted for 80% of the traffic.</p> <p>In 1962, President Kennedy appointed an advisory board to cope with what was rapidly turning into a crisis, and Robert Moon was at last able to ride his hobby horse.</p> <p>At the time, he was a postal inspector in Philadelphia and had been tinkering with various distribution schemes for 20 years. There were already rudimentary post codes in major cities around the world, of course, and Moon had unsuccessfully offered two improved versions to the US postal authorities. However, his final version was grabbed by the advisory board and put into operation on July 1 1963.</p> <p>His Zoning Improvement Plan was wonderfully simple and organisationally brilliant. The entire United States was broken into 10 zones, starting from 0 on the eastern coast to 9 on the western. To that first digit was added a second for the regional sorting centre, a third for the sectional sub-division, and so on. By the time the Zip code had reached five digits it could define almost any address to within a few city blocks.</p> <p>It took a while for the public to accept this addition to its addresses, but the scheme hit the marketing world like a bombshell. Detailed census information released by the government could isolate a maximum of 424 households in any given area.

      "bodyText": "If there was ever a good intention on the road to Hell, it was that of Robert Moon, who has died at the age of 83. His laudable aim, in which he succeeded brilliantly, was to speed the delivery of America's mail. But his deceptively simple scheme rapidly turned the demographic world on its head, brought unheard-of refinement to social discrimination, and unleashed an ever-growing mountain of junk mail. Moon was the man who invented the nationwide postal code. For the first 50 years of the 20th century, Americans used the post mainly for social letters, carried across the country on 10,000 mail trains and sorted in transit. By the late 1950s, however, two simultaneous developments were bringing the system to its knees. The railways were in precipitate decline, and equipment had been invented which enabled businesses to generate personalised mass mailings. Suddenly millions of pension cheques, electricity bills and mortgage payments arrived by post. By the early 1960s they accounted for 80% of the traffic. In 1962, President Kennedy appointed an advisory board to cope with what was rapidly turning into a crisis, and Robert Moon was at last able to ride his hobby horse. At the time, he was a postal inspector in Philadelphia and had been tinkering with various distribution schemes for 20 years. There were already rudimentary post codes in major cities around the world, of course, and Moon had unsuccessfully offered two improved versions to the US postal authorities. However, his final version was grabbed by the advisory board and put into operation on July 1 1963. His Zoning Improvement Plan was wonderfully simple and organisationally brilliant. The entire United States was broken into 10 zones, starting from 0 on the eastern coast to 9 on the western. To that first digit was added a second for the regional sorting centre, a third for the sectional sub-division, and so on. By the time the Zip code had reached five digits it could define almost any address to within a few city blocks. It took a while for the public to accept this addition to its addresses, but the scheme hit the marketing world like a bombshell. Detailed census information released by the government could isolate a maximum of 424 households in any given area. Some genius quickly realised that marrying this census material to the areas defined by the Zip code could offer an extraordinarily detailed profile of the population. Anyone wanting to send material to, say, college-educated whites with above-average incomes, suddenly had a much more precise tool. Rather more sinisterly, insurance companies had been handed a mechanism to \"redline\" specific high-risk areas (usually poor and black) and to load their premiums accordingly. The runaway success of Moon's scheme, which allowed each of thousands of machines to sort more than 500 letters a minute, brought widespread imitation around the world. Hard behind, naturally, came the marketeers to ensure that millions more doormats could be littered with unsolicited mail. America's addition of four further digits has enabled its modern Zip codes to define an address down to a specific building, and it is now possible to classify any postal area according to 62 separate criteria - ethnic composition, median income, mobility, education, spending patterns, and on and on. None of this was ever, of course, envisaged by poor Moon, who was just trying to do his best by his employers. As a youth, he had won a university scholarship, but could find no work to support him away from home. Instead, he became a postman in his home town and progressed through the service for the rest of his career. If the marketing industry had any soul it would raise a gold-plated statue to the man who inadvertently gave it the keys to the kingdom. \u0095 Robert Aurand Moon, postal worker, born April 15 1917; died April 10 2001",

The police! For little me! I was brought up to believe that bothering the police was as shameful as calling the Samaritans - look, I'm not saying this is a good thing, I'm just presenting it as an interesting sociological snippet vis-\u00e0-vis working-class life in the latter part of the 20th century - so I was quite upset. \"Oooh, what a waste of their time! Oooh,I'll be in trouble!\" </p> <p>But my confusion turned to outright alarm when it was suggested that I get in touch with my local police station, which, as luck would have it, is in the same street as me. \"Come now, they can't be that bad!\" I chaffed the young person at the Guardian. Then inspiration struck: \"Why don't you send them to me?\" I wheedled, \"and then I might be more scared - and I might feel I had to go to the police...\"</p> <p>\"Well... they're really scary... I don't know...\"</p> <p>\"Come on, I'm 41 years of age. I've been married twice - once to Tony Parsons! What fresh hell could exist after such dark knowledge? Bring it on!\"</p> <p>Well, as you can imagine, I was like a kiddie at Christmas the next day, eyes full of hope looking out the window for the postie. Finally, I took receipt of my bounty and, over a cup of tea and a nice plate of biccies, I stepped into the Salo-type netherworld that my warped admirer had planned for me. Suffice to say that not one thing was strong enough to make me choke on my Garibaldi, and after 10 minutes I was looking for the TV remote to see if Bergerac was on UK Gold. Frankly, there was nastier stuff than this in the first 50 pages of my novel, Ambition.</p> <p>This emergency over, the unkindness of strangers struck again when, in the first week of March, a stupid medium wrote to me telling me that I would meet my death on the 23rd. Apparently, I was going to die from head injuries, in a children's playground, and there would be a dog nearby. When I waved this letter gaily at my boyfriend, telling him that on the afternoon of the 23rd I planned to borrow my friend Nadia's barker and go on a long promenade through the foremost playgrounds and under the dodgiest scaffolding in Brighton, for some reason he took a) exception, b) the day off work and c) my front door keys. But, left to my own devices, I would have done it - and I would have lived.</p> <p>It's because of my own lack of nervousness, I suppose, that I felt quite disappointed last week to read that ladies of the stature of Diana Rigg, Joan Bakewell, Sue MacGregor and Honor Blackman had contacted the police over a series of smutty letters from a man who turns out to be, get this, in his 70s. The language used was described by police as \"pornographic, obscene and disgusting\", and there has been much talk in the papers of the \"trauma\" and \"blighted lives\" of the recipients.</p> <p> So, basically, after 25 years of frustration, the old perv has finally got what he wanted all along: to feel like a big strong man who scared the hell out of a bunch of famous broads. Doh! I've always believed that one of the great things about being 41 as opposed to 14 is that you don't spend your life in a constant sweat about how scary sex and men are. I honestly don't think I could be shocked now if I tried, and I like the feeling, because I never was the dewy, ing\u00e9nue type.</p> <p>I've never done it myself - frankly, I think I must have masturbated so much between the ages of 12 and 15 that I actually wore something away, because the pastime holds no allure whatsoever for me any more - but I've always thought that one of the most original and, yes, empowering things a woman could do would be to take mash letters sent to her with the aim of frightening, and use them as porn for her own ends, even circulating it among her friends! That would be SO MUCH what the writer didn't want - he wanted to scare a woman to death with his letters, and now there's a bunch of babes all over Maida Vale knocking one off over them. </p> <p>Talk about subversion. </p> <p>When Germaine Greer said some years back that rape wasn't the worst thing that could happen to a woman - as I recall, she said that this attitude \"gives that pathetic little piece of gristle far too much importance and power\" - I and the rest of the sisters were on her case before you could say \"knob\". But I think I see what she meant now. It's good that women feel far freer to report sexual harassment of any sort to the powers that be than they used to. At the same time, we must be careful not to care too much about what men say - or write - as this gives sexual threats exactly the power that the men who use them want them to have. A woman who laughs at a flasher makes him feel a fool; one who screams and runs away makes his day. If feminism is about anything, it is about not giving men what they want, when they want. </p> <p>So smile - and it'll never happen.</p>",

When I waved this letter gaily at my boyfriend, telling him that on the afternoon of the 23rd I planned to borrow my friend Nadia's barker and go on a long promenade through the foremost playgrounds and under the dodgiest scaffolding in Brighton, for some reason he took a) exception, b) the day off work and c) my front door keys. But, left to my own devices, I would have done it - and I would have lived. It's because of my own lack of nervousness, I suppose, that I felt quite disappointed last week to read that ladies of the stature of Diana Rigg, Joan Bakewell, Sue MacGregor and Honor Blackman had contacted the police over a series of smutty letters from a man who turns out to be, get this, in his 70s. The language used was described by police as \"pornographic, obscene and disgusting\", and there has been much talk in the papers of the \"trauma\" and \"blighted lives\" of the recipients. So, basically, after 25 years of frustration, the old perv has finally got what he wanted all along: to feel like a big strong man who scared the hell out of a bunch of famous broads. Doh! I've always believed that one of the great things about being 41 as opposed to 14 is that you don't spend your life in a constant sweat about how scary sex and men are. I honestly don't think I could be shocked now if I tried, and I like the feeling, because I never was the dewy, ing\u00e9nue type. I've never done it myself - frankly, I think I must have masturbated so much between the ages of 12 and 15 that I actually wore something away, because the pastime holds no allure whatsoever for me any more - but I've always thought that one of the most original and, yes, empowering things a woman could do would be to take mash letters sent to her with the aim of frightening, and use them as porn for her own ends, even circulating it among her friends! That would be SO MUCH what the writer didn't want - he wanted to scare a woman to death with his letters, and now there's a bunch of babes all over Maida Vale knocking one off over them. Talk about subversion. When Germaine Greer said some years back that rape wasn't the worst thing that could happen to a woman - as I recall, she said that this attitude \"gives that pathetic little piece of gristle far too much importance and power\" - I and the rest of the sisters were on her case before you could say \"knob\". But I think I see what she meant now. It's good that women feel far freer to report sexual harassment of any sort to the powers that be than they used to. At the same time, we must be careful not to care too much about what men say - or write - as this gives sexual threats exactly the power that the men who use them want them to have. A woman who laughs at a flasher makes him feel a fool; one who screams and runs away makes his day. If feminism is about anything, it is about not giving men what they want, when they want. So smile - and it'll never happen.",

That way, we'll wind up with a disgusting mush that erroneously attempts to combine cold and room temperature, wet and dry, spongy and slippery... I mean, really, whose idea was that?</p> <p><strong>2 Smash</strong><br> You'd think, wouldn't you, that if you were a pointy-head, and someone asked you to come up with a food substitute - and we're not even stipulating tasty food substitute here - that you'd come up with something a bit more challenging than mashed potato. I mean, if you were to sit there for ages, thinking \"what do people like very much, but tend to avoid, due to the onerousness of making it?\" you might think, oh, stuffed aubergines, or devils on horseback. You wouldn't think mashed potato. Honestly, if it weren't for the dudeish robots that sang in the adverts, someone could justifiably have burnt this company down.</p> <p><strong> 3 The nit nurse</strong><br></p> <p><strong> 4 Really hard liquorice</strong><br> What an odd phenomenon - a sweet so hard that it's closer to an industrial substance. Let us not forget, Swedish liquorice contained salt, so it was even worse than the English version.</p> <p><strong> 5 Pickled eggs</strong><br> In Wales, where pickled eggs are still a foodstuff of choice, they buy them with a bag of prawn cocktail crisps, then they scrunch the egg up in the crisps and eat the offending egg with a carapace of crisp around it, for flavour. If that doesn't say all there is to say about how noxious the things are, I can't think what does.</p> <p><strong>6 Wine in a box</strong><br> Well, we say this is a thing of the past, but in fact many people still drink wine in a box, in order to have a silver pillow left over to sleep on when they are finished. These people are derelicts. Not that there's anything wrong with being a derelict.</p> <p><strong> 7 Semolina with a blob of strawberry jam </strong><br> A pudding so rank that only the English palate could have come up with it, and furthermore, any outsider who had a heart would have stepped in and banned it. Ach, if you've asked it once, you've asked it a million times. Where are the French when you need them?</p> <p><strong> 8 Dream Topping</strong><br> It's actually quite hard to create a foodstuff with no nutrients in whatsoever. You wouldn't think it, to taste this stuff. </p> <p><strong>9 Whale meat</strong><br> Did we ever eat this? Were we informed of it, at the time? What was wrong with all the normal meat? You know, the past really is a foreign country.</p> <p> <strong>10 Thunderbird Peach Wine</strong><br> I refer you to wine in a box, above - there is nothing wrong with being a derelict. However, manufacturing wine specifically for derelicts, and then giving it girl-type flavours that will attract adolescent girls, and then making it the most disgusting drink ever, which could conceivably put them off alcohol for life. Well, that... that's just evil. </p> <p> <strong>11 Port and lemon</strong><br></p> <p><strong>12 Compulsory religious education</strong><br> There's nothing wrong with Christianity, no, nor Islam, nor Judaism neither. But inculcating tolerance and understanding into young minds was never what these lessons were about. They were devised perniciously to prepare us for undreamt-of boredom, in order that we might go out into our adult lives ready for any level of tedium that the workplace might throw at us. It actually worked quite well, if you think about it.</p> <p><strong>13 School medicals</strong><br> School nurses holding your testicles and asking you to cough, although actually this never really happened. In fact, it only ever occurred in a Carry On film.</p> <p><strong>14 Corporal punishment</strong><br></p> <p><strong>15 Blue gym knickers</strong><br> These, on the other hand, were absolutely essential to the school experience. How else would you realise how much larger your arse was than all your friends'? </p> <p><strong>16 School blancmange</strong><br></p> <p><strong>17 Duffel coats</strong><br> Did your mum at any stage chase you down the road, waving your duffel coat and shouting \"put this on\"? Mine did - most of them seem to have done, at some stage. What was this, exercise? Pilates for the baby-boom generation? Or was the duffel coat believed to have some kind of health-giving effect?</p> <p><strong>18 Snoods</strong><br> Ew. We thought we looked so stylish.</p> <p><strong>19 Socks with toes in them</strong><br> This must say something profound about the 70s zeitgeist, that it was considered amusing to make little glovelets of the sock. Not sure what.</p> <p><strong>20 Very short football shorts</strong><br> Many people, especially those who work in advertising, cherish the fantasy that women love to look at men with very short shorts. They think we like it, even when the man in question has an arse so ill-defined that it's almost impossible to tell how his legs connect to the rest of his body. They think we find it saucy, comic and endearing. We don't, you know.</p> <p><strong>21 Knee-high socks</strong><br> Conversely, these do have a certain comic appeal. But socks and comedy should never meet (see, socks with toes, above).</p> <p><strong>22 Nylon underwear</strong><br> I don't want to get too personal here, but did our forebears actively want thrush?</p> <p><strong>23 Prog rock</strong><br> Some would counter that prog rock is still with us, in the form of Radiohead. However, Radiohead generally include on each album a song or two that girls will listen to. True prog rock only appeals to maladjusted males. That's why it has died out, incidentally - because its target audience is now on the internet the whole time, learning how to make bombs.</p> <p><strong>24 Mr Blobby</strong><br></p> <p><strong>25 Hand-me-downs from your older siblings</strong><br> Have you noticed how people tend to have only one child nowadays, despite the well-documented benefits of siblings to a tot's socialisation and learning? That's because they all remember the astonishing sartorial injustice meted out to second, not to mention third children. In 20 years' time, when all these only-children have grown up, phrases like \"Uergh, look at your disgusting velour top\" will have virtually no meaning.</p> <p><strong>26 Skinheads</strong><br> An eyesore to everyone involved. Handy for Nazi phrenologists, though.</p> <p><strong>27 Skinny ties with keyboards on them</strong><br></p> <p><strong>28 Herbal ecstasy</strong><br> A completely effectless substance devised for people who urgently wanted to get off their heads, but were so concerned with legality and the state of their insides that they were prepared not to. More to the point, they were prepared to pay a substantial amount not to, and instead just swallow a pellet of grime, and grin for half an hour. What a swizz.</p> <p><strong>29 Micro scooters</strong><br> They haven't strictly died out yet, but I believe it's only a matter of days. They're just silly.</p> <p><strong>30 Badges</strong><br> I distinctly remember getting on a bus the morning after the 1992 election, to find someone wearing a badge saying \"Don't blame me - I voted Labour\". And I didn't blame him, I felt a pleasing shiver of ideological fellowship with him, even though I hadn't actually voted at all, because I couldn't be arsed. I blamed him for the bloody badge, though. Ridiculous things.</p> <p><strong>31 Dusty Bin</strong><br></p> <p><strong>32 The Word</strong><br> There's always a section of society that quite literally cannot believe how unremittingly dim young people are nowadays. Usually, it's the over-60s. For a while, though, as a direct result of this Channel Four television programme, all of us, young and old, were in perfect harmony on the matter.</p> <p><strong>33 Sanitary towels and their companion sanitary belts</strong><br> These are always good to remember when you're reading Virginia Woolf, or Iris Murdoch, or Lynne Reid Banks, or Rosamond Lehmann, or any beazel at all pre-1990, and thinking, \"Please put a lid on it, it's not actually that bad.\" It was that bad, it really was.</p> <p><strong>34 Catweazle</strong><br></p> <p><strong>35 Indoor fireworks</strong><br> Yes, someone missed the point again, didn't they? Fireworks are supposed to be dangerous. That's why children like them. That's why the whole ceremony - which, let's face it, commemorates a religious squabble which nobody can remember, and involves no presents at all - is still current among children, and has not been replaced by National PlayStation Day.

You'd be wrong, however, because you would be failing to factor in these monstrous four-minute medleys. </p> <p><strong>74 Hair mascara</strong><br></p> <p><strong>75 Polio</strong><br> Poor children of the past - all they wanted was a municipal swim, and they came back permanently crippled.</p> <p><strong>76 Top Of The Pops albums</strong><br> The producers of these LPs laboured under the misapprehension that children don't really know the cost of things, and don't realise that getting hold of a cover version of a hit is cheaper than the hit itself. On the contrary, most children can recognise the concept \"bargain basement\" before they can swallow solids, and laughed in the face of these sorry approximations of popular music. Incidentally, as a direct result of the TOTP albums, when the Now That's What I Call Music! albums arrived, people genuinely did say \"Now that's what I call music!\"</p> <p><strong>77 Legs &amp; Co</strong><br> All tits-'n'-teeth-'n'-rubbish dance routines, the Top Of The Pops dancers added even less to your appreciation of pop than the Top Of The Pops albums.</p> <p><strong>78 David and Elizabeth Emanuel</strong><br> There's an absolutely unbroken rule in the world of fashion, and it is that the pricier the garment, the more you want it, even if it really isn't your kind of thing at all - and besides, you've already got a pair of dungarees. A rule unbroken, that is, except by David and Elizabeth Emanuel. </p> <p> <strong>79 The Millennium Dome</strong><br> As bad as it could possibly have been, short of being tested on animals. Never mind. It's all over now.</p> <p><strong>80 Old licensing laws</strong><br> What a quaint idea - as long as you stop people drinking between the lunchtime yardarm and, erm, the dinnertime yardarm, they can't be alcoholic and will have to go to a gallery or something in the afternoon. Ha! They hadn't banked on the dazzling ingenuity of man and the existence of off-licences.</p> <p><strong>81 Green Shield stamps...</strong><br> ... and having to lick whole books of them for your nan</p> <p><strong>82 Rickets</strong><br> Since it's caused by a vitamin D deficiency, people used to blame rickets on the fact that it's always rainy in Britain, and there isn't enough sunlight. In fact, it's because they weren't eating enough vegetables, because chips are nicer.</p> <p><strong>83 Sweet cigarettes</strong><br> You thought the whole of life was arranged to stop children smoking? Think again! While nice teachers showed us videos of smoke-related amputations all day, naughty shopkeepers taught us the correct manner in which to handle and appreciate a cigarette. Is it any wonder we're confused? They were quite tasty, though.</p> <p><strong>84 More cigarettes</strong><br> Unlike these cigarettes, which weren't tasty at all. This was the kind of thing your friend's mother used to smoke, to stop you pinching them.</p> <p><strong>85 Biros you can rub out</strong><br> Except you never could rub them out, all you could do was make a large, childish mess on the page. I think this was in the manner of a conspiracy against children. Did you ever see a grown-up using one?</p> <p><strong>86 The Ford Edsel</strong><br></p> <p><strong>87 Letraset</strong><br></p> <p><strong>88 The rhythm method</strong><br> A fun game involving maths, sex and cunning guesswork. A terrible method of contraception.</p> <p><strong>89 Actors who pretended to sound like Gerry Adams</strong><br> Yet another wrong-headed Ireland-based law, this time with the knock-on effect of keeping a lot of mediocre actors in work when they would have been better off accepting that they were never going to get proper parts and therefore should re-train.</p> <p><strong>90 Cars that spoke instructions to you</strong><br></p> <p><strong>91 People who object to the word cunt, yet don't object to any other word for either kind of genitals</strong><br> Get over it.

Unlike childbirth, you have nothing to show for it at the end, apart from some excess fat or unwanted back hair, depending on your gender.</p> <p><strong>94 No sex before marriage</strong><br> Nobody really stuck to this - they just pretended to, for our amusement.</p> <p><strong>95 Dymo tape</strong><br> Once upon a time, this was simple playground fun - a small typing machine with which you could fashion short phrases, such as \"Zoe Is Cool\" or \"Leon Is Wicked\". That was all very well, apart from taking ages and being the most criminal waste of time since blowing eggs (which, incidentally, we also don't miss).</p> <p><strong>96 The cones hotline</strong><br></p> <p><strong>97 Colonialism</strong><br> It's amazing, to think of all those endearing little ideas we used to have. Like, \"Hang on a second, I can see brown people over there! What on earth do they think they're doing, going about their business in a perfectly reasonable way in their own country? Why, they're not even speaking English. They're just going to get it all wrong, and break things.\" If only we'd kept them to ourselves, and not done anything about it. </p> <p><strong>98 Nuclear Power: No Thanks/Nein Danke</strong><br> It says everything there is to say about the campaign against nuclear power, that they seriously thought a big red sun, grinning like an idiot on a yellow sticker, asking cheerfully for the termination of a multi-billion-pound industry, was going to make any kind of a difference. I mean, really.</p> <p><strong>99 People talking about punk, as though it were in any way important</strong><br> Or nice to listen to...</p> <p><strong>100 Suss laws</strong><br> Police, eh? Give 'em an inch and they invent new crimes, such as \"failing to deodorise properly\" or \"being foreign\". Bless, they were probably just bored. </p> <p><strong>101 Goldfish won at fairs that die as soon as you get them home. And then you have to flush them down the loo</strong><br> It's all very well teaching children how to deal with death, but is it a good idea to concertina the whole lesson into a half-hour period between joy and mourning?</p>",

      "bodyText": "1 Arctic Roll Let's take a perfectly good sponge cake, which could make a perfectly good Swiss roll for everyone to enjoy, and instead cover it in perfectly good ice-cream. That way, we'll wind up with a disgusting mush that erroneously attempts to combine cold and room temperature, wet and dry, spongy and slippery... I mean, really, whose idea was that? 2 Smash You'd think, wouldn't you, that if you were a pointy-head, and someone asked you to come up with a food substitute - and we're not even stipulating tasty food substitute here - that you'd come up with something a bit more challenging than mashed potato. I mean, if you were to sit there for ages, thinking \"what do people like very much, but tend to avoid, due to the onerousness of making it?\" you might think, oh, stuffed aubergines, or devils on horseback. You wouldn't think mashed potato. Honestly, if it weren't for the dudeish robots that sang in the adverts, someone could justifiably have burnt this company down. 3 The nit nurse 4 Really hard liquorice What an odd phenomenon - a sweet so hard that it's closer to an industrial substance. Let us not forget, Swedish liquorice contained salt, so it was even worse than the English version. 5 Pickled eggs In Wales, where pickled eggs are still a foodstuff of choice, they buy them with a bag of prawn cocktail crisps, then they scrunch the egg up in the crisps and eat the offending egg with a carapace of crisp around it, for flavour. If that doesn't say all there is to say about how noxious the things are, I can't think what does. 6 Wine in a box Well, we say this is a thing of the past, but in fact many people still drink wine in a box, in order to have a silver pillow left over to sleep on when they are finished. These people are derelicts. Not that there's anything wrong with being a derelict. 7 Semolina with a blob of strawberry jam A pudding so rank that only the English palate could have come up with it, and furthermore, any outsider who had a heart would have stepped in and banned it. Ach, if you've asked it once, you've asked it a million times. Where are the French when you need them? 8 Dream Topping It's actually quite hard to create a foodstuff with no nutrients in whatsoever. You wouldn't think it, to taste this stuff. 9 Whale meat Did we ever eat this? Were we informed of it, at the time? What was wrong with all the normal meat? You know, the past really is a foreign country. 10 Thunderbird Peach Wine I refer you to wine in a box, above - there is nothing wrong with being a derelict. However, manufacturing wine specifically for derelicts, and then giving it girl-type flavours that will attract adolescent girls, and then making it the most disgusting drink ever, which could conceivably put them off alcohol for life. Well, that... that's just evil. 11 Port and lemon 12 Compulsory religious education There's nothing wrong with Christianity, no, nor Islam, nor Judaism neither. But inculcating tolerance and understanding into young minds was never what these lessons were about. They were devised perniciously to prepare us for undreamt-of boredom, in order that we might go out into our adult lives ready for any level of tedium that the workplace might throw at us. It actually worked quite well, if you think about it. 13 School medicals School nurses holding your testicles and asking you to cough, although actually this never really happened. In fact, it only ever occurred in a Carry On film. 14 Corporal punishment 15 Blue gym knickers These, on the other hand, were absolutely essential to the school experience. How else would you realise how much larger your arse was than all your friends'? 16 School blancmange 17 Duffel coats Did your mum at any stage chase you down the road, waving your duffel coat and shouting \"put this on\"? Mine did - most of them seem to have done, at some stage. What was this, exercise? Pilates for the baby-boom generation? Or was the duffel coat believed to have some kind of health-giving effect? 18 Snoods Ew. We thought we looked so stylish. 19 Socks with toes in them This must say something profound about the 70s zeitgeist, that it was considered amusing to make little glovelets of the sock. Not sure what. 20 Very short football shorts Many people, especially those who work in advertising, cherish the fantasy that women love to look at men with very short shorts. They think we like it, even when the man in question has an arse so ill-defined that it's almost impossible to tell how his legs connect to the rest of his body. They think we find it saucy, comic and endearing. We don't, you know. 21 Knee-high socks Conversely, these do have a certain comic appeal. But socks and comedy should never meet (see, socks with toes, above). 22 Nylon underwear I don't want to get too personal here, but did our forebears actively want thrush? 23 Prog rock Some would counter that prog rock is still with us, in the form of Radiohead. However, Radiohead generally include on each album a song or two that girls will listen to. True prog rock only appeals to maladjusted males. That's why it has died out, incidentally - because its target audience is now on the internet the whole time, learning how to make bombs. 24 Mr Blobby 25 Hand-me-downs from your older siblings Have you noticed how people tend to have only one child nowadays, despite the well-documented benefits of siblings to a tot's socialisation and learning? That's because they all remember the astonishing sartorial injustice meted out to second, not to mention third children. In 20 years' time, when all these only-children have grown up, phrases like \"Uergh, look at your disgusting velour top\" will have virtually no meaning. 26 Skinheads An eyesore to everyone involved. Handy for Nazi phrenologists, though. 27 Skinny ties with keyboards on them 28 Herbal ecstasy A completely effectless substance devised for people who urgently wanted to get off their heads, but were so concerned with legality and the state of their insides that they were prepared not to. More to the point, they were prepared to pay a substantial amount not to, and instead just swallow a pellet of grime, and grin for half an hour. What a swizz. 29 Micro scooters They haven't strictly died out yet, but I believe it's only a matter of days. They're just silly. 30 Badges I distinctly remember getting on a bus the morning after the 1992 election, to find someone wearing a badge saying \"Don't blame me - I voted Labour\". And I didn't blame him, I felt a pleasing shiver of ideological fellowship with him, even though I hadn't actually voted at all, because I couldn't be arsed. I blamed him for the bloody badge, though. Ridiculous things. 31 Dusty Bin 32 The Word There's always a section of society that quite literally cannot believe how unremittingly dim young people are nowadays. Usually, it's the over-60s. For a while, though, as a direct result of this Channel Four television programme, all of us, young and old, were in perfect harmony on the matter. 33 Sanitary towels and their companion sanitary belts These are always good to remember when you're reading Virginia Woolf, or Iris Murdoch, or Lynne Reid Banks, or Rosamond Lehmann, or any beazel at all pre-1990, and thinking, \"Please put a lid on it, it's not actually that bad.\" It was that bad, it really was. 34 Catweazle 35 Indoor fireworks Yes, someone missed the point again, didn't they? Fireworks are supposed to be dangerous. That's why children like them. That's why the whole ceremony - which, let's face it, commemorates a religious squabble which nobody can remember, and involves no presents at all - is still current among children, and has not been replaced by National PlayStation Day. Indoor fireworks are like sugar-free easter eggs. 36 Tails of hair on the back of your head 37 Mini Milks What a sorry excuse for an ice cream, this was. No chocolate, no strawberry, no nuts, no creaminess, no surprises, no chewy centre, no nothing. As a treat, these were about on the same level of cruelty as the mums who made out that when ice-cream vans make that musical noise, it means they're empty. 38 Roland Rat 39 The Krankies Whenever people try to convey the icy evil of the Victorian age, the freak show is always right up there with the seven-year-old chimney sweep and the starving, almost-dead person. So what exactly were we playing at, with this pair? 40 BBC presenters speaking with received pronunciation Clearly, it's a sorry kind of country that can't celebrate the diversity of its proud regions by letting them do their voices on the telly. Worse, though, was the fact that received pronunciation tends to sound a little judgmental, a wee bit puritanical, just a smidgen anti-mess, anti-sex, anti-high-fat-foodstuffs, anti-life. And when you're not used to telly, and you still think the people in that little box can see out, imagine how much that messes with your head. Why, people used to have to spring clean before they turned the news on. 41 Monkey The closest I ever came to adolescent despair, before becoming an adolescent, was turning on the telly to find only Monkey. It was the worst programme this civilisation has ever seen. 42 My Little Pony It's true, all girls do want a pony. They also all want to be air-hostesses, but do you buy them a purple plastic air-hostess, and encourage them to brush its pink synthetic hair? Of course not, you tell them to pull themselves together and think of a proper job. 43 Stylophones The first pop use of these crappy sounding hand-held synthesisers was on Space Oddity by David Bowie. A good omen, you might think. Not a bad toy, you might think. Then you take into account that their big-name endorser was Rolf Harris, and you realise just how rubbish and shoddy they were. 44 Rubik's cube The only people who could ever complete these were the ones who took them apart with a screwdriver and put them back together again. Anyone who tells you any different is lying. 45 Tamagotchis I believe the idea is this: you give your child, or whoever it is in your household petitioning for a pet, a small electronic device. The device makes noises to indicate that it wants food, exercise or affection, and you press buttons to oblige. Thus, in all respects it resembles a pet, apart from being fluffy, cute, loyal, buoyant or a thing of joy to hold and keep forever. 46 The Barron Knights The only pop group who managed to be middle-aged before they were 20 and misspell a word as simple as \"Baron\". They're still going, by the way, on the Butlins circuit. So not missing them is largely a hypothetical concept - after all, we don't know how little we'll miss them when they're really gone. 47 Chas &amp; Dave and other cockney rock Like socks, music should never have a comic agenda. Therefore, even working on the charitable premise that cockney accents are as funny as Chas &amp; Dave thought they were, the pair still should have been chased from the planet by dogs. Dennis Waterman, however, can do whatever he likes. He's a poppet. 48 The national anthem played at the theatre More than one million painful student fringe shows, more than one rubbish adaptation too many of Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Raquin, more than mime, Two Gentlemen Of Verona, and seven-hour productions by Polish people speaking in Polish, this simple ritual put the nation off going to the theatre. It managed to convey, with such ease and simplicity, the fact that everyone else there would be a freak in a cummerbund who wanted to bring back hanging. 49 House coats They're all very well in films, as open invitations to passing trades-men to have a crack at having sex with you, but in real life they make you look like a dinner lady. 50 Swing-Ball A pitiful excuse for a game, purchased by parents who are simply too idle to take you to the park, play any kind of game with you, or even engage you in simple conversation to relieve your boredom. In a Swing-Ball- owning household, the question: \"Why did you bother having me at all?\" is not part of the adolescent rebellion phase at all, it's a perfectly reasonable enquiry. 51 Deely-Boppers On the other hand, if your children insisted on wearing ridiculous bits of plastic which \"boinged\", would you want to talk to them or play any kind of game with them?

Create a mini-Pinter psycho drama of suppurating familial resentments? 70 Amstrads The only machine capable of giving you a headache in the four-minute window between starting up and breaking down. 71 Gobbing at gigs Men are always finding new and innovative ways to express their masculinity and assert themselves as alpha members of their gender. This must have been about the least effective. 72 Brut aftershave This must have been about the second-least effective. 73 Stars On 45 When you look at frights like Hear'Say, you'd be forgiven for thinking that everything associated with popular music is as rotten as it's ever been. You'd be wrong, however, because you would be failing to factor in these monstrous four-minute medleys. 74 Hair mascara 75 Polio Poor children of the past - all they wanted was a municipal swim, and they came back permanently crippled. 76 Top Of The Pops albums The producers of these LPs laboured under the misapprehension that children don't really know the cost of things, and don't realise that getting hold of a cover version of a hit is cheaper than the hit itself. On the contrary, most children can recognise the concept \"bargain basement\" before they can swallow solids, and laughed in the face of these sorry approximations of popular music. Incidentally, as a direct result of the TOTP albums, when the Now That's What I Call Music! albums arrived, people genuinely did say \"Now that's what I call music!\" 77 Legs &amp; Co All tits-'n'-teeth-'n'-rubbish dance routines, the Top Of The Pops dancers added even less to your appreciation of pop than the Top Of The Pops albums. 78 David and Elizabeth Emanuel There's an absolutely unbroken rule in the world of fashion, and it is that the pricier the garment, the more you want it, even if it really isn't your kind of thing at all - and besides, you've already got a pair of dungarees. A rule unbroken, that is, except by David and Elizabeth Emanuel. 79 The Millennium Dome As bad as it could possibly have been, short of being tested on animals. Never mind. It's all over now. 80 Old licensing laws What a quaint idea - as long as you stop people drinking between the lunchtime yardarm and, erm, the dinnertime yardarm, they can't be alcoholic and will have to go to a gallery or something in the afternoon. Ha! They hadn't banked on the dazzling ingenuity of man and the existence of off-licences. 81 Green Shield stamps... ... and having to lick whole books of them for your nan 82 Rickets Since it's caused by a vitamin D deficiency, people used to blame rickets on the fact that it's always rainy in Britain, and there isn't enough sunlight. In fact, it's because they weren't eating enough vegetables, because chips are nicer. 83 Sweet cigarettes You thought the whole of life was arranged to stop children smoking? Think again! While nice teachers showed us videos of smoke-related amputations all day, naughty shopkeepers taught us the correct manner in which to handle and appreciate a cigarette. Is it any wonder we're confused? They were quite tasty, though. 84 More cigarettes Unlike these cigarettes, which weren't tasty at all. This was the kind of thing your friend's mother used to smoke, to stop you pinching them. 85 Biros you can rub out Except you never could rub them out, all you could do was make a large, childish mess on the page. I think this was in the manner of a conspiracy against children. Did you ever see a grown-up using one? 86 The Ford Edsel 87 Letraset 88 The rhythm method A fun game involving maths, sex and cunning guesswork. A terrible method of contraception. 89 Actors who pretended to sound like Gerry Adams Yet another wrong-headed Ireland-based law, this time with the knock-on effect of keeping a lot of mediocre actors in work when they would have been better off accepting that they were never going to get proper parts and therefore should re-train. 90 Cars that spoke instructions to you 91 People who object to the word cunt, yet don't object to any other word for either kind of genitals Get over it. Just because it makes a cute, Anglo-Saxon explosive noise doesn't mean it's any worse than, say, willy. 92 Your mother spitting on your hanky and wiping your face 93 Puberty Like childbirth, nobody bothers to tell you just how start-to-finish rotten this experience is going to be. Unlike childbirth, you have nothing to show for it at the end, apart from some excess fat or unwanted back hair, depending on your gender. 94 No sex before marriage Nobody really stuck to this - they just pretended to, for our amusement. 95 Dymo tape Once upon a time, this was simple playground fun - a small typing machine with which you could fashion short phrases, such as \"Zoe Is Cool\" or \"Leon Is Wicked\". That was all very well, apart from taking ages and being the most criminal waste of time since blowing eggs (which, incidentally, we also don't miss). 96 The cones hotline 97 Colonialism It's amazing, to think of all those endearing little ideas we used to have. Like, \"Hang on a second, I can see brown people over there! What on earth do they think they're doing, going about their business in a perfectly reasonable way in their own country? Why, they're not even speaking English. They're just going to get it all wrong, and break things.\" If only we'd kept them to ourselves, and not done anything about it. 98 Nuclear Power: No Thanks/Nein Danke It says everything there is to say about the campaign against nuclear power, that they seriously thought a big red sun, grinning like an idiot on a yellow sticker, asking cheerfully for the termination of a multi-billion-pound industry, was going to make any kind of a difference. I mean, really. 99 People talking about punk, as though it were in any way important Or nice to listen to... 100 Suss laws Police, eh? Give 'em an inch and they invent new crimes, such as \"failing to deodorise properly\" or \"being foreign\". Bless, they were probably just bored. 101 Goldfish won at fairs that die as soon as you get them home. And then you have to flush them down the loo It's all very well teaching children how to deal with death, but is it a good idea to concertina the whole lesson into a half-hour period between joy and mourning?",

      "body": "<p><strong>West Country Girl</strong></p> <p>With a crooked smile and a heart-shaped face<br> Comes from the West Country where the birds sing bass<br> She's got a house-big heart where we all live<br> And plead and counsel and forgive<br> Her widow's peak, her lips I've kissed<br> Her gloves of bone at her wrist<br> That I have held in my hand<br> Her Spanish fly and her monkey gland<br> Her godly body and its fourteen stations<br> That I have embraced, her palpitations<br> Her unborn baby crying, Mummy<br> Amongst the rubble of her body<br> Her lovely lidded eyes I've sipped<br> Her fingernails, all pink and chipped<br> Her accent which I'm told is 'broad'<br> That I have heard and has been poured<br> Into my human heart and filled me<br> With love, up to the brim, and killed me<br> And rebuilt me back anew<br> With something to look forward to<br> Well, who could ask much more than that?<br> A West Country Girl with a big fat cat<br> That looks into her eyes of green<br> And meaows, 'He loves you', then meaows again<br></p> <p> That was a song called West Country Girl. It is a love song. It began, in its innocence, as a poem written in Australia, where the sun shines. I wrote it with my heart in my mouth, listing the physical details that drew me towards a particular person . . . the West Country Girl. It set forth my own personal criteria of beauty, my own particular truth about beauty, as angular, cruel and impoverished as it probably was. It was a list of things I loved, and, in truth, a wretched excuse in flattery, designed to win the girl. And it worked and it didn't work. But the peculiar magic of the love song, if it has the heart to do it, is that it endures where the object of the song does not. It attaches itself to you, and together you move through time. But it does more than that, for just as it is our task to move forward, to cast off our past, to change and to grow, in short, to forgive ourselves and each other, the love song holds within it an eerie intelligence all its own - to reinvent the past and to lay it at the feet of the present. West Country Girl began in innocence and in sunshine, as a simple poem about a girl. But it has done what all love songs must do in order to survive: it has demanded the right to its own identity, its own life, its own truth. I've seen it grow and mutate with time. It presents itself now as a cautionary tale, as a list of ingredients in a witches' brew, it reads as a coroner's report, or a message on a sandwich-board worn by a wild-eyed man who states, \"The end of the world is at hand.\" It is a hoarse voice in the dark that croaks, \"Beware . . . beware . . . beware.\" Anyway, I'm getting ahead of myself. </p> <p><strong>People Ain't No Good</strong></p> <p>People just ain't no good<br> I think that's well understood<br> You can see it everywhere you look<br> People just ain't no good<br> <br> We were married under cherry trees<br> Under blossom we made our vows<br> All the blossoms came sailing down<br> Through the streets and through the playgrounds<br> <br> The sun would stream on the sheets<br> Awoken by the morning bird<br> We'd buy the Sunday newspapers<br> And never read a single word<br> <br> People they ain't no good<br> People they ain't no good<br> People they ain't no good<br> <br> Seasons came, seasons went<br> The winter stripped the blossoms bare<br> A different tree now lines the streets<br> Shaking its fists in the air<br> <br> The winter slammed us like a fist<br> The windows rattling in the gales<br> To which she drew the curtains<br> Made out of her wedding veils<br> <br> People they ain't no good<br> People they ain't no good<br> People they ain't no good<br> To our love send a dozen white lilies<br> To our love send a coffin of wood<br> To our love let all the pink-eyed pigeons coo<br> That people they just ain't no good<br> To our love send back all the letters<br> To our love a valentine of blood<br> To our love let all the jilted lovers cry<br> That people they just ain't no good<br> <br> It ain't that in their hearts they're bad<br> They can comfort you, some even try<br> They nurse you when your ill of health<br> They bury you when you go and die<br> It ain't that in their hearts they're bad<br> They'd stick by you if they could<br> But that's just bullshit<br> People just ain't no good<br></p> <p>People they just ain't no good <br> People they just ain't no good<br> People they just ain't no good<br> People they just ain't no good<br></p> <p>I performed a more conservative, lo-tech version of this essay at the Poetry Academy in Vienna last year. I was invited to actually teach a group of adult students about songwriting. But first they wanted me to give a public lecture. The subject I chose was the love song, and in doing it - I mean, standing up in front of a crowd of people and teaching, lecturing - I was filled with a host of conflicting feelings. The strongest, most insistent of these was one of abject horror. Horror, because my late father was an English literature teacher at the high school I attended back in Australia - you know, where the sun shines. I have very clear memories of being about 12 and sitting in a classroom watching my father, who would be standing, up here, where I am standing, and thinking to myself, gloomily and miserably - for, in the main, I was a gloomy and miserable child - \"It doesn't really matter what I do with my life as long as I don't end up like my father.\" Now, at 41, it would appear there is virtually no action I can take that does not draw me closer to him, that does not make me more like him. At 41, I have become my father, and here I am, ladies and gentlemen, teaching.</p> <p> Looking back over the past 20 years, a certain clarity prevails. Amidst the madness and the mayhem, it would seem I have been banging on one particular drum. I see that my artistic life has centred around an attempt to articulate an almost palpable sense of loss that laid claim to my life. A great gaping hole was blasted out of my world by the unexpected death of my father when I was 19. The way I learned to fill this hole, this void, was to write. My father taught me this as if to prepare me for his own passing. Writing allowed me direct access to my imagination, to inspiration and, ultimately, to God. </p> <p>I found that, through the use of language, I was writing God into existence. Language became the blanket that I threw over the invisible man, which gave him shape and form. The actualisation of God through the medium of the love song remains my prime motivation as an artist. I found that language became a poultice to the wounds incurred by the death of my father. Language became a salve to longing.</p> <p>The loss of my father created in my life a vacuum, a space in which my words began to float and collect and find their purpose. WH Auden said, \"the so-called traumatic experience is not an accident, but the opportunity for which the child has been patiently waiting - had it not occurred, it would have found another - in order that its life became a serious matter\". The death of my father was this \"traumatic experience\" that left the hole for God to fill. How beautiful the notion that we create our own personal catastrophes and that it is the creative forces within us that are instrumental in doing this. Here, our creative impulses lie in ambush at the side of our lives, ready to leap forth and kick holes in it - holes through which inspiration can rise. We each have our need to create, and sorrow itself is a creative act.</p> <p> Though the love song comes in many guises - songs of exaltation and praise, of rage and of despair, erotic songs, songs of abandonment and loss - they all address God, for it is the haunted premise of longing that the true love song inhabits. It is a howl in the void for love and for comfort, and it lives on the lips of the child crying for his mother. It is the song of the lover in need of their loved one, the raving of the lunatic supplicant petitioning his God. It is the cry of one chained to the earth and craving flight, a flight into inspiration and imagination and divinity. The love song is the sound of our endeavours to become God-like, to rise up and above the earth-bound and the mediocre. I believe the love song to be a sad song. It is the noise of sorrow itself.</p> <p>We all experience within us what the Portuguese call \"saudade\", an inexplicable longing, an unnamed and enigmatic yearning of the soul, and it is this feeling that lives in the realms of imagination and inspiration, and is the breeding ground for the sad song, for the love song. Saudade is the desire to be transported from darkness into light, to be touched by the hand of that which is not of this world. The love song is the light of God, deep down, blasting up though our wounds.</p> <p>In his brilliant lecture, The Theory And Function Of Duende, Frederico Garcia Lorca attempts to shed some light on the eerie and inexplicable sadness that lives at the heart of certain works of art. \"All that has dark sounds has 'duende',\" he says, \"that mysterious power that everyone feels but no philosopher can explain.\" Contemporary rock music seems less inclined to have at its soul, restless and quivering, the sadness that Lorca talks about. Excitement, often, anger, sometimes - but true sadness, rarely. Bob Dylan has always had it. Leonard Cohen deals specifically with it. It pursues Van Morrison like a black dog and, though he tries to, he cannot escape it. Tom Waits and Neil Young can summon it. My friends The Dirty 3 have it by the bucketload. But, all in all, it would appear that the duende is too fragile to survive the compulsive modernity of the music industry. In the hysterical technocracy of modern music, sorrow is sent to the back of the class, where it sits, pissing its pants in mortal terror. Duende, needs space to breathe. Melancholy hates haste and floats in silence. I feel sorry for sadness, as we jump all over it, denying its voice and muscling it into the outer reaches. No wonder sorrow doesn't smile much. No wonder sadness is so sad.</p> <p>All love songs must contain \"duende\", because the love song is never simply happy. It must first embrace the potential for pain. Those songs that speak of love, without having within their lines an ache or a sigh, are not love songs at all, but rather hate songs disguised as love songs, and are not to be trusted. These songs deny us our human-ness and our God-given right to be sad, and the airwaves are littered with them. The love song must resonate with the whispers of sorrow and the echoes of grief. The writer who refuses to explore the darker reaches of the heart will never be able to write convincingly about the wonder, magic and joy of love, for just as goodness cannot be trusted unless it has breathed the same air as evil, so within the fabric of the love song, within its melody, its lyric, one must sense an acknowledgement of its capacity for suffering.</p> <p><strong>Sad Waters</strong></p> <p>Down the road I look and there runs Mary<br> Hair of gold and lips like cherries<br> We go down to the river where the willows weep<br> Take a naked root for a lovers' seat<br> That rose out of the bitten soil<br> But bound to the ground by creeping ivy coils<br> O Mary you have seduced my soul<br> (And I don't know right from wrong)<br> Forever a hostage of your child's world<br> <br> And then I ran my tin-cup heart along<br> The prison of her ribs<br> And with a toss of her curls<br> That little girl goes waddling in<br> Rolling her dress up past her knee<br> Turning these waters into wine<br> Then she plaited all the willow vines<br> Mary in the shallows laughing<br> Over where the carp dart<br> Spooked by the new shadows that she cast<br> Across these sad waters and across my heart<br> </p> <p><a href=\"http://books.theguardian.com/extracts/story/0,6761,475957,00.html\">Continued</a></p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>You might think, judging by the current crop, that to be an \"It\" girl you need to be born in Belgravia with a Cartier spoon in your mouth. Not so. It was a barmaid and a shop assistant who were the notably un-posh, earliest embodiments of \"It\". Back then, class was beside the point. The point was sex. </p> <p>Rudyard Kipling, generally regarded as a particularly strait-laced Edwardian imperialist, was the first to use the \"It\" word in relation to feminine allure. In Mrs Bathhurst, his short story of 1904, Kipling referred to the \"special quality\" of the eponymous barmaid. \"Tisn't beauty, so to speak, nor good talk necessarily. It's just It. Some women'll stay in a man's memory once they walk down the street.\" For Kipling, \"It\" was a euphemism for sex appeal. Meanwhile, in the US at the beginning of the century, to be \"it\" was to be \"the ultimate\", hinting at the hip, right-time-right-place connotations the phrase went on to evoke.</p> <p>The romantic novelist Elinor Glyn merged the definitions, actually entitling one of her short novels, It. \"To have 'It', the fortunate possessor must have that strange magnetism which attracts both sexes. 'It' is a purely virile quality, belonging to a strong character... There must be physical attraction, but beauty is unnecessary.\" In the 1927 Paramount movie based on Glyn's book, - also called, simply, It - a department store owner becomes infatuated with one of his \"pert and unabashed\" employees (played by Clara Bow), a possessor of \"It\". The imperious Madame Glyn, who appeared in the film as herself, displayed some of the It-girl tendencies that she espoused: she became famous in Hollywood for tea parties where she received guests in silk pyjamas and read them poetry while reclining on a tiger skin.</p> <p>Clara Bow had already established herself as the flapper par excellence. She had, said F Scott Fitzgerald, \"something to stir every pulse in the nation\". Whatever the role, she was warm, flirtatious and always vivacious. It was before the Hays Code brought the censors to the cutting room, and Bow was Hollywood's first sex symbol, outselling contemporaries Greta Garbo and Lillian Gish at the box office, and paving the way for the likes of Jean Harlow and Mae West. </p> <p>The movie took America by storm. The actress and the role became inseparable in the public imagination, and Bow became known as the \"It girl\". She was the epitome of the Jazz Age - a million miles from the society gels who gained It status in subsequent decades. She was born in a run-down Brooklyn tenement, and her break came when she won a movie magazine's beauty contest; the prize was a film role. At the age of 18, she landed a contract in Hollywood. She famously swore like a trooper in her strong Brooklyn accent - and was completely without airs, graces or any particular regard for etiquette. She was not part of the smart Hollywood set, preferring to play all-night poker with her chauffeur, cook and maid. In her roles as manicurists, waitresses, usherettes, dance hall hostesses and shop girls, she exuded warmth and humour - her public felt that she was one of them. She was an unstoppable exhibitionist, dyed her hair flame red, and was often to be seen driving down Sunset Boulevard in a bright red Packard with her pet chow dyed to match.</p> <p>If it is the essence of the It girl that she encapsulates the spirit of her times, then Bow was the perfect flighty, hedonistic emblem for the postwar, pre-depression era. A touch too hedonistic and fast living, as it turned out. Society may well be mesmerised by racy, bad-girl beauties, but can, in equal measure, be self-righteously appalled by them. Bow was to provide the blueprint for many an It-girl downfall.</p> <p>Trouble started when she was cited in a divorce case, by the wife of Dr William Earl Pearson. Then, Daisy DeVoe, Bow's former best friend, went to the press with lurid tales of the star's alleged booze- and drug-fuelled sexual antics. Though most of the rumours proved unfounded, and DeVoe ended up in jail, the mud stuck to Bow. It was the beginning of the end and, with the arrival of the Talkies, she was finished. A nervous breakdown ensued. The first victim of It-girl burnout, her career over at the age of 28, she withdrew to a ranch in Nevada, eventually dying a recluse at the age of 60.</p> <p>There were other candidates for the title of It girl in the 20s, among them the British \"Brunette Bombshell\" Chili Bouchier; the sultry Theda Bara; the hard-partying, Algonquin-attending Tallulah Bankhead; hostess-with-the-mostest Nancy Cunard and fashion doyenne Daisy Fellowes. But, as Kenneth Anger put it in his anthology of movie scandal Hollywood Babylon, \"The eclipse of Clara Bow, who had been for an entire generation Flaming Youth personified, clinched Holly-wood's reputation as the Place Where Girls Go Wrong.\"</p> <p>Over in Britain at the start of the 30s, the famous-for-being-famous phenomenon was emerging, and among the new It-girls were Mona Bismarck, Rose Bingham and Brenda Frazier - so famous that a new word, \"celebutante\", was coined to describe them. For this new breed, the designer to be seen in was Schiaparelli, with shoes by Ferragamo, and the must-have accessory, a cigarette case by Cartier. Debutante frenzy was at its zenith; as the economic slump deepened, so society sought escapism, fantasy, glamour. The most celebrated deb of them all was Margaret Whigham, whom the public took unresentfully to their hearts.</p> <p> Born the daughter of a Glasgow apprentice who had made himself a millionaire, Whigham was Debutante of the Year at the age of 18 in 1931. She was engaged to the Earl of Warwick at 20, but instead married the American golfer Charles Sweeney. She was widely acknowledged as one of the world's greatest beauties, and even featured in the Cole Porter song You're The Top, in which \"Mrs Sweeney\" is singled out along with such examples of human achievement as the Louvre, the Mona Lisa and the sonnets of Shakespeare.</p> <p>The 30s were her heyday but, in 1963, with her divorce from second husband the Duke of Argyll - the longest and most sensational divorce to occur in Britain - Whigham, now the Duchess of Argyll, entered folklore in a different light. Part of the duke's evidence was two Polaroid photographs, one showing his wife engaged in fellatio. The picture did not show the man's face, and the identity of the \"headless man\" remained a mystery for years (recently it was confirmed that he was in fact the then Conservative cabinet minister Duncan Sandys; the actor Douglas Fairbanks Jr featured in the second photograph, also headless). The character assassination of the duchess by the judge was merciless.</p> <p>The duchess lost the admiration of the public and was cast into social purgatory. It was not just her reputation that the divorce cost her, but much of her fortune. She died in 1993 in a nursing home, a few years after being sued over a \u00a320,000 overdraft.</p> <p>A number of American society girls - Gloria Guinness and Millicent Rogers among them - took up the baton. Babe Paley, along with Daisy Fellowes, remains one of fashion's most revered It girls. Her confidant Truman Capote once commented, \"Babe Paley had only one fault: she was perfect; otherwise, she was perfect.\" Paley was neither outrageous nor controversial, but her influence on fashion has been enduring: her look combined simple clothes (trouser suits, to-the-knee skirts, crisp shirts) and a pristine, obsessive neatness that somehow contrived to look effortless. She was for a time an editor on US Vogue, and the fashion press adored her, running a story every time she so much as changed her hat. Beauty, perfect manners and kindness were the qualities most commonly attributed to her. She was born Barbara Cushing, and though not \"of society\" she and her two sisters were groomed by their mother to marry wealthy men. Her sisters chose a Rockefeller and an Astor, Babe chose an oil tycoon, Stanley Mortimer. They soon divorced, and Babe married again - this time to William S Paley, chairman of CBS television. The pair were avid art collectors and lived in a bubble of perfection with their several impeccable houses and their yacht, on which Babe lounged picturesquely.</p> <p>Paley often confided in her friend Capote, a frequent house guest and a regular at their many parties. He was a good listener, and Paley shared with him intimate secrets about her marriage. But Capote betrayed her and many of his other society friends, telling their stories - thinly disguised - in his book Answered Prayers. The book caused a scandal, though in this instance the It girl Paley was not the one who paid the price. The incident united the ranks of New York society against a regretful Capote, and his banishment was believed to be a contributory factor in his later death from chronic alcoholism.</p> <p>The brand of flamboyant, high-maintenance narcissism that became the trademark of the 90s It girl first took hold of Britain in the 50s. It was an opportune moment: glitz and excess were in short supply, and the royal family, after the prewar abdication, were, with the possible exception of Princess Margaret, cultivating homely ways. Into the breech stepped the models Fiona Campbell-Walter and Barbara Goalen who, when she married, attracted hundreds of spectators at Caxton Hall. The look of the 50s It girl was luxurious and showy: diamonds, mink, show-stopping strapless evening gowns, pearls, evening gloves up to the elbow.</p> <p>The British public again showed its weakness for a title, and it was Lady Docker, famous for her gold-plated, zebra-upholstered Daimler, who rose to true It-girl status. Known in the press as \"naughty Nora\", she was exuberant and extravagant. She and Sir Bernard - her third millionaire husband and a chairman of 50 companies, including Daimler - were constantly in the headlines, notably in the summer of 1954, when they threw a party on their 863-tonne luxury yacht for 45 Leeds coalminers. A Daily Mirror columnist reportedly \"failed completely\" to \"squeeze a sneer from these colliers, suddenly cast into circumstances of the most appalling luxury\".</p> <p>Naughty Nora's plain-speaking approach endeared her to the public. When the Monaco royal family omitted the Dockers' son from their invitation to the christening of Prince Albert, an almighty row ensued, culminating in Nora publicly tearing up the principality's flag. She was banned from the country. Much of Lady Docker's appeal lay in her \"common touch\", an important quality for any successful It girl. She was from a working-class Derby background, and became a hostess at London's Cafe de Paris before her succession of marriages.</p> <p>Lady Docker faded from the headlines in the 60s, a decade she never much took to. When the Beatles received their MBEs, she commented that it was the end of Britain's \"age of elegance\". It was also the end, for the time being, of the British preoccupation with blue blood. The new fluidity of the class structure in the Swinging London era meant that the 60s It girl was more democratically elected. Wildly diverse types, such as working-class Christine Keeler, Oscar-winning Julie Christie, model Jean Shrimpton and aristocratic Jane Ormsby-Gore were all granted It status. Each brought her own trademark to the era - kinky boots (Keeler), pale lipstick (Christie), elfin look (Shrimpton), antique dresses (Ormsby-Gore) - which, along with the Mary Quant miniskirts, false eyelashes and gamine fringes sported by other Its, were emulated by thousands.</p> <p>There was a wildness to the 60s It girls that was new. They were a spontaneous, risk-taking, hedonistic bunch: qualities, it must be said, that make the more recent It girls - every outing planned for optimum exposure - look contrived, and, well, rather bland. But like their flapper predecessor Clara Bow, many of the 60s Its paid a price for their racy behaviour - and the nation's alternating admiration and censoriousness.</p> <p>The diamond-and-mink-clad It girls of the 30s and 50s prized a titled consort above any other. In the decade that followed, a Jack-Daniel's drinking, acid-dropping rock star was the boyfriend of choice. Anita Pallenberg and Marianne Faithfull, the girlfriends of Rolling Stones Keith Richards and Mick Jagger, respectively, were the quintessential rock chick It girls. If anyone defined the mood of the decade it was Faithfull, especially with her leather-jump-suited film role in Girl On A Motorcycle.</p> <p>The bad-girl fantasy was all very well, but when the public deemed it too close to reality, moral panic ensued. In the police drug bust at Richards's house in 1967, the headlines focused on Faithfull and a colourful myth involving a sexual act and a Mars bar circulated. By the tail end of the decade, she was perceived as the embodiment of 60s excess, and laid low by heroin addiction. In 1979 she re-emerged, with a dark, husky-voiced album Broken English, a million miles from her 1964 folky pop hit As Tears Go By. \"Life has used me as its personal punch bag,\" she said.</p> <p>It was bad-girl allure that also drew the press and public to Keeler, another victim of the double-edged nature of It status. In a recent television interview, Keeler said she was \"not unlike an It girl in my day.</p> <p>I mean I was out to have a good time.\" Although at the time, Mandy Rice-Davies was the folk heroine of the Profumo trial, it was Keeler whose It-girl status endured. The famous photograph of Keeler astride an Arne Jacobsen chair, taken in 1963, did much to imprint her image on the nation's psyche. The photographer, Lewis Morley, recalls a wide-eyed, rather naive woman. Yet the photograph conveys something else - it became an icon of defiance and sexual liberation, parodied by Joe Orton, reconstructed in ads, lads' mags, copied by Kylie Minogue and the Spice Girls. Life wasn't generous to Keeler after the trial. A nine-month stretch in Holloway for perjury and two divorces led to decades of poverty on a run-down council estate.\"I took on the sins of everybody,\" she said in the recent interview. \"Of a generation, really.\"</p> <p>The70s proved incapable of producing a British It girl. Bianca Jagger was, for a time, famous for being famous, and for looking fabulous in Saint Laurent tuxedos and Halston frocks, but she retreated to New York to become the queen of nightclub Studio 54. The 80s, too, were a fallow period for the Brit It girl.</p> <p>In the mid-90s, however, she was back - with a vengeance. In 1995, not one, but five young women appeared on the cover of Tatler magazine under the It-girl banner. They were all young ladies of \"good pedigree\", little visible means of income and vast designer wardrobes. In fact, one of the five, Tara Palmer-Tomkinson was already well on her way to It-girl status due to her column in the Sunday Times Style section. Jeremy Langmead, then editor of Style (now editor of Nova), hired her on the strength of an interview she gave to promote Ray-Ban sunglasses. As a friend of the royals and with a propensity for self-mockery, Palmer-Tomkinson was, says Langmead, the perfect candidate for a society gossip column. The column was \"heavily edited\", as he phrases it. \"As Tara always said, she lived the column, which was far more important than writing it.\" And the readers loved her, he says. \"Tara was quite happy to make herself a comedy figure, rather than just blowing her own trumpet. She had the common touch. Because she was genuinely upper class, she didn't have to pretend, she had no airs and graces.\"</p> <p>When Palmer-Tomkinson checked into rehab, \"the bubble burst\", he says. \"Suddenly people realised that it wasn't all as glossy and glamorous as it looked, and that it was cocaine that was fuelling that wonderful lifestyle.\" It should, in theory, have ended there. But just when it looked as if the latest crop of It girls had had their day, and had become the \"Post-it\"girls, another one cropped up - Lady Victoria Hervey, who has taken over the Tara slot at the Sunday Times.</p> <p>The fact that It-dom has, in the past few years, once again become a preserve of the upper classes, may seem a bizarrely old-fashioned state of affairs. It was a backlash to a backlash. The early 90s, in contrast to the \"me decade\" that had gone before, saw a preoccupation in fashion circles with a gritty, grungey realism. \"There wasn't much laughing or smiling going on,\" Langmead recalls. This peculiarly down-at-heel aesthetic crept from the fashion press into the mainstream, and was dubbed heroin chic. \"It was uncool to be posh,\" says Langmead. Essex girls such as Denise van Outen were the stars of the time. Upper-class Notting Hill types slumming it, but on daddy's trust fund, became known as Trustafarians, and public school boys were putting on mockney accents.</p> <p> Before long, though, the austere sensibility of the early 90s gave way to an economic boom and the re-emergence of party-going. The groomed and unapologetically posh good-time girls Tara, Tamara Beckwith and Normandie Keith were, as Langmead points out, \"a reaction to what had come before\". As the Gucci/Prada frenzy began to take hold in the glossy mags, it was inevitable that the new It girls would be an incarnation of privilege. Ultimately, the 90s were every bit as obsessed with conspicuous wealth, unabashed luxury and \"designer\" lifestyles as the 80s had been. The girls soon made it from the pages of the glossies and Hello! into the tabloids, via London's Met Bar - outside which paparazzi gathered night after night. Before long, it wasn't just the fashion houses who embraced the new gang of Its - jeans companies, hosiery brands, high street chains, all clamoured to enlist them.</p> <p>Now that It-girl saturation has set in, however, Hervey begins to look like an It girl too far. She did herself no favours in a recent Guardian interview, on the one hand boasting of the freebies she receives, and on the other deriding those who get their handouts courtesy of the state. Even the Daily Mail was moved to comment, with its own slant (that she was letting down her class): \"Most of us would be hard-put to see the moral distinction between the undeserving poor and the undeserving rich.\" Hervey is the career It girl par excellence - her clothing boutique Akademi has prospered in line with her rise to fame - and she is not so much a good-time girl, as a party girl with a purpose, the purpose being publicity.</p> <p>Never before has It been such a money-spinner. With their sponsorship and advertising deals and newspaper columns, Hervey and her ilk are the first Its to have profited so directly from their status. And who can blame them? Even when their It-ness fades, they diversify: Keith has become the beauty editor of a Sunday newspaper; even the beleaguered, post rehab Tara is now a director of a hotel group. None of them is liable to end up destitute - unlike some of their crash-and-burn predecessors.</p> <p>But somehow it seems improbable that the It girls of the turn of the millennium will be remembered in quite the same way. For all their flaws and all their narcissism, the earlier Its were not cynical or calculating. Cashing in would quite simply have been deemed non-It. They never worked at being It, but rather had It-ness thrust upon them. Like Elinor Glyn's fictional It heroine, Lady Victoria Hervey is a shop girl, of sorts - but the similarity ends there. As Glyn wrote in her It-girl definition: \"She must be entirely unselfconscious... indifferent to the effect she is producing. Self-consciousness destroys 'It' immediately.\"</p>",

Clara Bow had already established herself as the flapper par excellence. She had, said F Scott Fitzgerald, \"something to stir every pulse in the nation\". Whatever the role, she was warm, flirtatious and always vivacious. It was before the Hays Code brought the censors to the cutting room, and Bow was Hollywood's first sex symbol, outselling contemporaries Greta Garbo and Lillian Gish at the box office, and paving the way for the likes of Jean Harlow and Mae West. The movie took America by storm. The actress and the role became inseparable in the public imagination, and Bow became known as the \"It girl\". She was the epitome of the Jazz Age - a million miles from the society gels who gained It status in subsequent decades. She was born in a run-down Brooklyn tenement, and her break came when she won a movie magazine's beauty contest; the prize was a film role. At the age of 18, she landed a contract in Hollywood. She famously swore like a trooper in her strong Brooklyn accent - and was completely without airs, graces or any particular regard for etiquette. She was not part of the smart Hollywood set, preferring to play all-night poker with her chauffeur, cook and maid. In her roles as manicurists, waitresses, usherettes, dance hall hostesses and shop girls, she exuded warmth and humour - her public felt that she was one of them. She was an unstoppable exhibitionist, dyed her hair flame red, and was often to be seen driving down Sunset Boulevard in a bright red Packard with her pet chow dyed to match. If it is the essence of the It girl that she encapsulates the spirit of her times, then Bow was the perfect flighty, hedonistic emblem for the postwar, pre-depression era. A touch too hedonistic and fast living, as it turned out. Society may well be mesmerised by racy, bad-girl beauties, but can, in equal measure, be self-righteously appalled by them. Bow was to provide the blueprint for many an It-girl downfall. Trouble started when she was cited in a divorce case, by the wife of Dr William Earl Pearson. Then, Daisy DeVoe, Bow's former best friend, went to the press with lurid tales of the star's alleged booze- and drug-fuelled sexual antics. Though most of the rumours proved unfounded, and DeVoe ended up in jail, the mud stuck to Bow. It was the beginning of the end and, with the arrival of the Talkies, she was finished. A nervous breakdown ensued. The first victim of It-girl burnout, her career over at the age of 28, she withdrew to a ranch in Nevada, eventually dying a recluse at the age of 60. There were other candidates for the title of It girl in the 20s, among them the British \"Brunette Bombshell\" Chili Bouchier; the sultry Theda Bara; the hard-partying, Algonquin-attending Tallulah Bankhead; hostess-with-the-mostest Nancy Cunard and fashion doyenne Daisy Fellowes. But, as Kenneth Anger put it in his anthology of movie scandal Hollywood Babylon, \"The eclipse of Clara Bow, who had been for an entire generation Flaming Youth personified, clinched Holly-wood's reputation as the Place Where Girls Go Wrong.\" Over in Britain at the start of the 30s, the famous-for-being-famous phenomenon was emerging, and among the new It-girls were Mona Bismarck, Rose Bingham and Brenda Frazier - so famous that a new word, \"celebutante\", was coined to describe them. For this new breed, the designer to be seen in was Schiaparelli, with shoes by Ferragamo, and the must-have accessory, a cigarette case by Cartier. Debutante frenzy was at its zenith; as the economic slump deepened, so society sought escapism, fantasy, glamour. The most celebrated deb of them all was Margaret Whigham, whom the public took unresentfully to their hearts. Born the daughter of a Glasgow apprentice who had made himself a millionaire, Whigham was Debutante of the Year at the age of 18 in 1931. She was engaged to the Earl of Warwick at 20, but instead married the American golfer Charles Sweeney. She was widely acknowledged as one of the world's greatest beauties, and even featured in the Cole Porter song You're The Top, in which \"Mrs Sweeney\" is singled out along with such examples of human achievement as the Louvre, the Mona Lisa and the sonnets of Shakespeare. The 30s were her heyday but, in 1963, with her divorce from second husband the Duke of Argyll - the longest and most sensational divorce to occur in Britain - Whigham, now the Duchess of Argyll, entered folklore in a different light. Part of the duke's evidence was two Polaroid photographs, one showing his wife engaged in fellatio. The picture did not show the man's face, and the identity of the \"headless man\" remained a mystery for years (recently it was confirmed that he was in fact the then Conservative cabinet minister Duncan Sandys; the actor Douglas Fairbanks Jr featured in the second photograph, also headless). The character assassination of the duchess by the judge was merciless. The duchess lost the admiration of the public and was cast into social purgatory. It was not just her reputation that the divorce cost her, but much of her fortune. She died in 1993 in a nursing home, a few years after being sued over a \u00a320,000 overdraft. A number of American society girls - Gloria Guinness and Millicent Rogers among them - took up the baton. Babe Paley, along with Daisy Fellowes, remains one of fashion's most revered It girls. Her confidant Truman Capote once commented, \"Babe Paley had only one fault: she was perfect; otherwise, she was perfect.\" Paley was neither outrageous nor controversial, but her influence on fashion has been enduring: her look combined simple clothes (trouser suits, to-the-knee skirts, crisp shirts) and a pristine, obsessive neatness that somehow contrived to look effortless. She was for a time an editor on US Vogue, and the fashion press adored her, running a story every time she so much as changed her hat. Beauty, perfect manners and kindness were the qualities most commonly attributed to her. She was born Barbara Cushing, and though not \"of society\" she and her two sisters were groomed by their mother to marry wealthy men. Her sisters chose a Rockefeller and an Astor, Babe chose an oil tycoon, Stanley Mortimer. They soon divorced, and Babe married again - this time to William S Paley, chairman of CBS television. The pair were avid art collectors and lived in a bubble of perfection with their several impeccable houses and their yacht, on which Babe lounged picturesquely. Paley often confided in her friend Capote, a frequent house guest and a regular at their many parties. He was a good listener, and Paley shared with him intimate secrets about her marriage. But Capote betrayed her and many of his other society friends, telling their stories - thinly disguised - in his book Answered Prayers. The book caused a scandal, though in this instance the It girl Paley was not the one who paid the price. The incident united the ranks of New York society against a regretful Capote, and his banishment was believed to be a contributory factor in his later death from chronic alcoholism. The brand of flamboyant, high-maintenance narcissism that became the trademark of the 90s It girl first took hold of Britain in the 50s. It was an opportune moment: glitz and excess were in short supply, and the royal family, after the prewar abdication, were, with the possible exception of Princess Margaret, cultivating homely ways. Into the breech stepped the models Fiona Campbell-Walter and Barbara Goalen who, when she married, attracted hundreds of spectators at Caxton Hall. The look of the 50s It girl was luxurious and showy: diamonds, mink, show-stopping strapless evening gowns, pearls, evening gloves up to the elbow. The British public again showed its weakness for a title, and it was Lady Docker, famous for her gold-plated, zebra-upholstered Daimler, who rose to true It-girl status. Known in the press as \"naughty Nora\", she was exuberant and extravagant. She and Sir Bernard - her third millionaire husband and a chairman of 50 companies, including Daimler - were constantly in the headlines, notably in the summer of 1954, when they threw a party on their 863-tonne luxury yacht for 45 Leeds coalminers. A Daily Mirror columnist reportedly \"failed completely\" to \"squeeze a sneer from these colliers, suddenly cast into circumstances of the most appalling luxury\". Naughty Nora's plain-speaking approach endeared her to the public. When the Monaco royal family omitted the Dockers' son from their invitation to the christening of Prince Albert, an almighty row ensued, culminating in Nora publicly tearing up the principality's flag. She was banned from the country. Much of Lady Docker's appeal lay in her \"common touch\", an important quality for any successful It girl. She was from a working-class Derby background, and became a hostess at London's Cafe de Paris before her succession of marriages. Lady Docker faded from the headlines in the 60s, a decade she never much took to. When the Beatles received their MBEs, she commented that it was the end of Britain's \"age of elegance\". It was also the end, for the time being, of the British preoccupation with blue blood. The new fluidity of the class structure in the Swinging London era meant that the 60s It girl was more democratically elected. Wildly diverse types, such as working-class Christine Keeler, Oscar-winning Julie Christie, model Jean Shrimpton and aristocratic Jane Ormsby-Gore were all granted It status. Each brought her own trademark to the era - kinky boots (Keeler), pale lipstick (Christie), elfin look (Shrimpton), antique dresses (Ormsby-Gore) - which, along with the Mary Quant miniskirts, false eyelashes and gamine fringes sported by other Its, were emulated by thousands. There was a wildness to the 60s It girls that was new. They were a spontaneous, risk-taking, hedonistic bunch: qualities, it must be said, that make the more recent It girls - every outing planned for optimum exposure - look contrived, and, well, rather bland. But like their flapper predecessor Clara Bow, many of the 60s Its paid a price for their racy behaviour - and the nation's alternating admiration and censoriousness. The diamond-and-mink-clad It girls of the 30s and 50s prized a titled consort above any other. In the decade that followed, a Jack-Daniel's drinking, acid-dropping rock star was the boyfriend of choice. Anita Pallenberg and Marianne Faithfull, the girlfriends of Rolling Stones Keith Richards and Mick Jagger, respectively, were the quintessential rock chick It girls. If anyone defined the mood of the decade it was Faithfull, especially with her leather-jump-suited film role in Girl On A Motorcycle. The bad-girl fantasy was all very well, but when the public deemed it too close to reality, moral panic ensued. In the police drug bust at Richards's house in 1967, the headlines focused on Faithfull and a colourful myth involving a sexual act and a Mars bar circulated. By the tail end of the decade, she was perceived as the embodiment of 60s excess, and laid low by heroin addiction. In 1979 she re-emerged, with a dark, husky-voiced album Broken English, a million miles from her 1964 folky pop hit As Tears Go By. \"Life has used me as its personal punch bag,\" she said. It was bad-girl allure that also drew the press and public to Keeler, another victim of the double-edged nature of It status. In a recent television interview, Keeler said she was \"not unlike an It girl in my day. I mean I was out to have a good time.\" Although at the time, Mandy Rice-Davies was the folk heroine of the Profumo trial, it was Keeler whose It-girl status endured. The famous photograph of Keeler astride an Arne Jacobsen chair, taken in 1963, did much to imprint her image on the nation's psyche. The photographer, Lewis Morley, recalls a wide-eyed, rather naive woman. Yet the photograph conveys something else - it became an icon of defiance and sexual liberation, parodied by Joe Orton, reconstructed in ads, lads' mags, copied by Kylie Minogue and the Spice Girls. Life wasn't generous to Keeler after the trial. A nine-month stretch in Holloway for perjury and two divorces led to decades of poverty on a run-down council estate.\"I took on the sins of everybody,\" she said in the recent interview. \"Of a generation, really.\" The70s proved incapable of producing a British It girl. Bianca Jagger was, for a time, famous for being famous, and for looking fabulous in Saint Laurent tuxedos and Halston frocks, but she retreated to New York to become the queen of nightclub Studio 54. The 80s, too, were a fallow period for the Brit It girl. In the mid-90s, however, she was back - with a vengeance. In 1995, not one, but five young women appeared on the cover of Tatler magazine under the It-girl banner. They were all young ladies of \"good pedigree\", little visible means of income and vast designer wardrobes. In fact, one of the five, Tara Palmer-Tomkinson was already well on her way to It-girl status due to her column in the Sunday Times Style section. Jeremy Langmead, then editor of Style (now editor of Nova), hired her on the strength of an interview she gave to promote Ray-Ban sunglasses. As a friend of the royals and with a propensity for self-mockery, Palmer-Tomkinson was, says Langmead, the perfect candidate for a society gossip column. The column was \"heavily edited\", as he phrases it. \"As Tara always said, she lived the column, which was far more important than writing it.\" And the readers loved her, he says. \"Tara was quite happy to make herself a comedy figure, rather than just blowing her own trumpet. She had the common touch. Because she was genuinely upper class, she didn't have to pretend, she had no airs and graces.\" When Palmer-Tomkinson checked into rehab, \"the bubble burst\", he says. \"Suddenly people realised that it wasn't all as glossy and glamorous as it looked, and that it was cocaine that was fuelling that wonderful lifestyle.\" It should, in theory, have ended there. But just when it looked as if the latest crop of It girls had had their day, and had become the \"Post-it\"girls, another one cropped up - Lady Victoria Hervey, who has taken over the Tara slot at the Sunday Times. The fact that It-dom has, in the past few years, once again become a preserve of the upper classes, may seem a bizarrely old-fashioned state of affairs. It was a backlash to a backlash. The early 90s, in contrast to the \"me decade\" that had gone before, saw a preoccupation in fashion circles with a gritty, grungey realism. \"There wasn't much laughing or smiling going on,\" Langmead recalls. This peculiarly down-at-heel aesthetic crept from the fashion press into the mainstream, and was dubbed heroin chic. \"It was uncool to be posh,\" says Langmead. Essex girls such as Denise van Outen were the stars of the time. Upper-class Notting Hill types slumming it, but on daddy's trust fund, became known as Trustafarians, and public school boys were putting on mockney accents. Before long, though, the austere sensibility of the early 90s gave way to an economic boom and the re-emergence of party-going. The groomed and unapologetically posh good-time girls Tara, Tamara Beckwith and Normandie Keith were, as Langmead points out, \"a reaction to what had come before\". As the Gucci/Prada frenzy began to take hold in the glossy mags, it was inevitable that the new It girls would be an incarnation of privilege. Ultimately, the 90s were every bit as obsessed with conspicuous wealth, unabashed luxury and \"designer\" lifestyles as the 80s had been. The girls soon made it from the pages of the glossies and Hello! into the tabloids, via London's Met Bar - outside which paparazzi gathered night after night. Before long, it wasn't just the fashion houses who embraced the new gang of Its - jeans companies, hosiery brands, high street chains, all clamoured to enlist them. Now that It-girl saturation has set in, however, Hervey begins to look like an It girl too far. She did herself no favours in a recent Guardian interview, on the one hand boasting of the freebies she receives, and on the other deriding those who get their handouts courtesy of the state. Even the Daily Mail was moved to comment, with its own slant (that she was letting down her class): \"Most of us would be hard-put to see the moral distinction between the undeserving poor and the undeserving rich.\" Hervey is the career It girl par excellence - her clothing boutique Akademi has prospered in line with her rise to fame - and she is not so much a good-time girl, as a party girl with a purpose, the purpose being publicity. Never before has It been such a money-spinner. With their sponsorship and advertising deals and newspaper columns, Hervey and her ilk are the first Its to have profited so directly from their status. And who can blame them? Even when their It-ness fades, they diversify: Keith has become the beauty editor of a Sunday newspaper; even the beleaguered, post rehab Tara is now a director of a hotel group. None of them is liable to end up destitute - unlike some of their crash-and-burn predecessors. But somehow it seems improbable that the It girls of the turn of the millennium will be remembered in quite the same way. For all their flaws and all their narcissism, the earlier Its were not cynical or calculating. Cashing in would quite simply have been deemed non-It. They never worked at being It, but rather had It-ness thrust upon them. Like Elinor Glyn's fictional It heroine, Lady Victoria Hervey is a shop girl, of sorts - but the similarity ends there. As Glyn wrote in her It-girl definition: \"She must be entirely unselfconscious... indifferent to the effect she is producing. Self-consciousness destroys 'It' immediately.\"",

      "body": "<b>Myth 1: Muscle turns into fat when you stop exercising</b> <br> False. Fat and muscle are two different types of tissue, and one cannot turn into the other. But less of one does allow more room for the other, and it's important to keep a high ratio of muscle to fat for several reasons. \"Muscle is a heavier tissue than fat, and is more costly for the body to run in terms of calories, so a muscular body burns more,\" says lifestyle and fitness expert Joanna Hall. <p><b>Myth 2: Weight training builds unsightly bulk in women</b><br> False. Testosterone is primarily responsible for a muscle's bulk, and women don't have enough to build Popeye-sized bulges. To develop significant size, you need to exhaust your muscles, which only women who are serious about body building tend to do. </p> <p><b>Myth 3: There's an ideal 'fat burning zone' </b><br> False. \"However long it takes you to run a marathon, you burn the same amount of calories,\" says sports scientist and former Olympic runner Dr Sarah Rowell. \"It just hurts more to do it faster.\" It's not how much fat you burn during exercise, but how much is burned during recovery. When you work harder, your metabolism stays high for longer, so more total fat is burned. </p> <p><b>Myth 4: To lose weight, I must eat less</b><br> Not necessarily. You'll put on weight if you eat more than you burn off, but using up more energy by increasing your activity level is a better way to balance the equation than eating less. On a very low-calorie diet, the body tucks into lean muscle reserves rather than fat to keep going. When the calorie count goes down, the body goes into preservation mode and is more careful to conserve supplies in case the famine continues, slowing your metabolism further and making a weight gain on return to normal rations certain. </p> <p><b>Myth 5: Lots of sit-ups will give me a six-pack </b><br> True, but only partly. \"You won't get six-pack definition unless you reduce your body fat all over through diet and aerobic exercise,\" says John Brewer, director of the Lilleshall Human Performance Centre. \"But if you've got poor technique, you won't get good results.\"</p> <p><b>Myth 6: I'm too busy to exercise</b><br> False. You don't have to work the body's 600-plus muscles separately to gain health benefits. In the gym, try moves that use several muscles at a time - squats, lunges, dips and push-ups. If you still can't make time for the gym, try climbing the stairs rather than taking the lift. At home, gardening or playing football with the kids will burn more calories than a brisk walk for the same duration. If you're perspiring and slightly out of breath, it's working.</p> <p><b>Myth 7: Men can't get cellulite</b><br> True. But nor can women, because there's no such thing, says Professor Catherine Geissler, head of health sciences at King's College, London. \"Cellulite is just ordinary body fat plus gravity. It takes on a different outward appearance in places where the skin sags - around the hips and buttocks - and is more obvious in women because they naturally carry extra fat in those areas.\" Controlling it is the same as for fat in the rest of the body - reduce dietary fat, and exercise. </p> <p><b>Myth 8: If I give up smoking, I'll put on weight</b><br> True, unless you adjust your lifestyle accordingly, says director of Action on Smoking and Health, Clive Bates. \"The effect of nicotine means that people have a higher metabolic rate and smaller appetite when they smoke, so when they give up they may put on weight. But the amount is usually small and is as much related to behavioural as physiological changes.\" </p> <p><b>Myth 9: I can't help my weight - I've got heavy bones</b><br> False. While genes do play a part in body size, the size of the basic human skeleton minus layers of flesh and fat falls within fairly narrow parameters. Indeed, \"heavy bones\" are a sign of health, says Dr Rowell.</p> <p><b>Myth 10: You can sweat weight off in a sauna</b><br> True, but it's only water, which must be quickly replaced, not fat. \"Anyone who believes this to be a valid way to proper weight loss is living in the dark ages,\" says Brewer.</p>",

Myth 3: There's an ideal 'fat burning zone' False. \"However long it takes you to run a marathon, you burn the same amount of calories,\" says sports scientist and former Olympic runner Dr Sarah Rowell. \"It just hurts more to do it faster.\" It's not how much fat you burn during exercise, but how much is burned during recovery. When you work harder, your metabolism stays high for longer, so more total fat is burned. Myth 4: To lose weight, I must eat less Not necessarily. You'll put on weight if you eat more than you burn off, but using up more energy by increasing your activity level is a better way to balance the equation than eating less. On a very low-calorie diet, the body tucks into lean muscle reserves rather than fat to keep going. When the calorie count goes down, the body goes into preservation mode and is more careful to conserve supplies in case the famine continues, slowing your metabolism further and making a weight gain on return to normal rations certain. Myth 5: Lots of sit-ups will give me a six-pack True, but only partly. \"You won't get six-pack definition unless you reduce your body fat all over through diet and aerobic exercise,\" says John Brewer, director of the Lilleshall Human Performance Centre. \"But if you've got poor technique, you won't get good results.\" Myth 6: I'm too busy to exercise False. You don't have to work the body's 600-plus muscles separately to gain health benefits. In the gym, try moves that use several muscles at a time - squats, lunges, dips and push-ups. If you still can't make time for the gym, try climbing the stairs rather than taking the lift. At home, gardening or playing football with the kids will burn more calories than a brisk walk for the same duration. If you're perspiring and slightly out of breath, it's working. Myth 7: Men can't get cellulite True. But nor can women, because there's no such thing, says Professor Catherine Geissler, head of health sciences at King's College, London. \"Cellulite is just ordinary body fat plus gravity. It takes on a different outward appearance in places where the skin sags - around the hips and buttocks - and is more obvious in women because they naturally carry extra fat in those areas.\" Controlling it is the same as for fat in the rest of the body - reduce dietary fat, and exercise. Myth 8: If I give up smoking, I'll put on weight True, unless you adjust your lifestyle accordingly, says director of Action on Smoking and Health, Clive Bates. \"The effect of nicotine means that people have a higher metabolic rate and smaller appetite when they smoke, so when they give up they may put on weight. But the amount is usually small and is as much related to behavioural as physiological changes.\" Myth 9: I can't help my weight - I've got heavy bones False. While genes do play a part in body size, the size of the basic human skeleton minus layers of flesh and fat falls within fairly narrow parameters. Indeed, \"heavy bones\" are a sign of health, says Dr Rowell. Myth 10: You can sweat weight off in a sauna True, but it's only water, which must be quickly replaced, not fat. \"Anyone who believes this to be a valid way to proper weight loss is living in the dark ages,\" says Brewer.",

The Latifs' second home, in a remote valley near the foothills of the Aravalli mountain range, is a little remnant of the couple's wanderlust. \"We searched for a long time,\" Bronwyn remembers, \"and when we heard of this crumbling place, used by local people for their livestock, I thought, 'Yes, this is it'.\"</p> <p>\"Haveli\", which literally translates as \"enclosure\", is more specifically a town house or mansion built around a courtyard in traditional style.

When Bronwyn and Salim first arrived at the haveli, there was no road, so they had to build one. The house stands alone, nestling against a small hill, in the middle of fields which are farmed by local villagers. The haveli is three storeys high, with a roof that doubles as a bedroom during the Indian summer. There is a cool darkness inside - the only available light comes from a central courtyard. Neither the ground nor first floor has been restored yet, so the Latifs perform an elaborate kind of camping in the grey, cavernous stone chambers that come off the central courtyard.

The place is too remote to be looted: caretakers permanently live in one corner of the house, and besides, the Latifs' feel they are part of the little local community, which will keep a watchful eye on the property.</p> <p>The couple are expert at setting up home within an hour of arrival, and the process of imbuing an empty house with life, of decorating it each time, afresh, is extraordinary to see. The building is ghostly until beds are recovered from a store room. A temporary kitchen is set up and Salim sets up the Calor Gas stove and the primitive air conditioner. Bronwyn creates a living room, this time she decides it's the Tiger Room, with fake tiger-skin rugs set on cotton blue-and-white striped dhurries (woven rugs), cushions are plumped up, a candelabra set with candles, kerosene lamps lit in all the dark alcoves. The table is laid in style, complete with napkins and colourful Rajasthani enamel plates. Vases are filled with flowers, bowls are heaving with fruit, wine glasses are suddenly brimming over.</p> <p>The first decision is where to sleep for the night. \"At the moment, our favourite place is on the roof,\" says Bronwyn, \"under a huge overhanging tree. We tie the mosquito net on to a branch and perform a balancing act to get into bed.\" She painted the traditional, hand-made beds blue.\"They were made by the local carpenter, who made them five foot nine inches long, so l had to order new ones to accommodate my tall husband and tall friends. When I painted the legs, the carpenter nearly had a fit - he hadn't seen a woman with a paint pot before.\"</p> <p>The most sensual experience in the house is the bathroom, where there is an open view over surrounding fields and the distant, imposing mountain range. Aromatic herbs in tubs of fresh water are ready for the bathing ritual where you sit on a ceramic Khurja stool and pour over the fragrant water. As the day grows hotter, Bronwyn will pour water over the ground which creates an instant cooling effect.</p> <p>Her training in fine art and ceramics feeds into the decoration of the house, and in corners it has a peculiarly European feel. Before marriage, Bronwyn set up home on the Greek island of Lesbos. She met and married Salim in Greece in 1975. It was a trip back to Australia after Chloe's birth - via India - that changed the course of their lives. They wanted to stay. It was a decision they have never regretted and both now run businesses from Delhi.

      "body": "<p>They are known in the car trade as tyre-kickers: those who know nothing about cars but stroll slowly round the vehicle, kicking the tyres trying to look like a pro. Estate agents, too, have their own phrase for the mug punter trying to cover up his ignorance: the wall-tapper. \"Knocking on the walls is one of the all-time classics,\" says Ed Mead of Douglas &amp; Gordon's Chelsea office.</p> <p>\"It tells you nothing at all.\" These days, tyre-kickers are a dying breed, but when it comes to buying a property most of us are still tapping away with a hopelessly deluded air of expertise.</p> <p>And it doesn't stop at scrutinising the plasterwork, either. The shameless amateur is also betrayed by their habit of looking up drainpipes or putting a spirit level on the mantelpiece. Others concentrate on the plumbing: \"We get a lot of loo-flushers,\" says Jay Chitnis, of estate agency HJC in Thames Ditton, Surrey. \"I don't know what that's all about.\" Indeed, the idea of not buying a \u00a3300,000 house because of a \u00a310 faulty ball cock is somewhat bizarre.</p> <p>Another source of amusement for agents is the tap-turner, a character desperately worried about water pressure, specifically the weak dribbles that pass for showers in some parts of the country. \"They don't understand how the bath/shower switch works, and invariably end up soaked,\" says Chitnis.</p> <p>While wall-tappers and their ilk are regarded with benign tolerance by most agents, the soi-disant price expert is emphatically not. \"One thing that is terribly annoying is the applicant talking the property down while viewing it,\" says Mead. \"They might complain that there is no way a double bed will fit in, when it obviously will, or talk about some friend who bought a similar property a couple of doors down for 20% cheaper. As an agent, I need to judge whether they know what they're talking about, or whether they're being completely unrealistic in order to knock the price down.\"</p> <p>\"You often get clients who march into a property and immediately start saying, 'Oh, it's grossly overpriced',\" adds Chitnis. \"They're often just doing it to show off to their girlfriends, but they've painted themselves into a corner, and it's very difficult to do business with someone after they've made a confrontational statement like that.\"</p> <p>Then there are the gadget freaks. Basic questions about fixtures and fittings are, of course, to be expected, yet Chitnis says that he and his colleagues have been asked, for example, whether the view comes with the property, or if the seller is leaving the double-glazing behind. At the top end of the market, it goes way beyond carpets and curtains, so the agent has to do a lot of homework just to keep up: \"They ask about Lutron lighting, surround sound, Linn hi-fi sockets and different makes of plasma screen,\" says Lulu Egerton, residential director at Lane Fox. This kind of client is also obsessed by security and wardrobe space: \"They want to know where they can store the spring collection, the summer ensemble, and so on.\"</p> <p>The public's enthusiasm for feng shui is also not matched in the estate agent community: \"We get clients insisting on energy-flow diagrams, asking if the property has been dowsed,\" says Chitnis. Some clients believe that roads at junctions can let in evil spirits, and that walking past bedrooms to get to reception rooms is bad chi. \"One client was very insistent that there be no church bells in earshot. Apparently, these are a sign of death,\" says Egerton. \"Unfortunately, South Kensington, where she was looking, is full of churches.\"</p> <p>While most of us try hard to appear down-to-earth and sensible when house-hunting, the super-rich don't care how dotty they sound, and can afford the luxury of making preposterous demands. \"I recently took a well-known singer around a flat in Notting Hill, who stood staring out the window for about 10 minutes, apparently testing the karma,\" says Matthew Kaye of Chesterfield, in central London. Most frustrating of all, he says, was the house-hunter who dreamt of good fortune behind a red front door, and so would look only at houses that already had one. Many helpful vendors offered to get the Dulux out, but to no avail. The paintwork had to be old and peeling, as it was in the dream.</p>",

      "bodyText": "They are known in the car trade as tyre-kickers: those who know nothing about cars but stroll slowly round the vehicle, kicking the tyres trying to look like a pro. Estate agents, too, have their own phrase for the mug punter trying to cover up his ignorance: the wall-tapper. \"Knocking on the walls is one of the all-time classics,\" says Ed Mead of Douglas &amp; Gordon's Chelsea office. \"It tells you nothing at all.\" These days, tyre-kickers are a dying breed, but when it comes to buying a property most of us are still tapping away with a hopelessly deluded air of expertise. And it doesn't stop at scrutinising the plasterwork, either. The shameless amateur is also betrayed by their habit of looking up drainpipes or putting a spirit level on the mantelpiece. Others concentrate on the plumbing: \"We get a lot of loo-flushers,\" says Jay Chitnis, of estate agency HJC in Thames Ditton, Surrey. \"I don't know what that's all about.\" Indeed, the idea of not buying a \u00a3300,000 house because of a \u00a310 faulty ball cock is somewhat bizarre. Another source of amusement for agents is the tap-turner, a character desperately worried about water pressure, specifically the weak dribbles that pass for showers in some parts of the country. \"They don't understand how the bath/shower switch works, and invariably end up soaked,\" says Chitnis. While wall-tappers and their ilk are regarded with benign tolerance by most agents, the soi-disant price expert is emphatically not. \"One thing that is terribly annoying is the applicant talking the property down while viewing it,\" says Mead. \"They might complain that there is no way a double bed will fit in, when it obviously will, or talk about some friend who bought a similar property a couple of doors down for 20% cheaper. As an agent, I need to judge whether they know what they're talking about, or whether they're being completely unrealistic in order to knock the price down.\" \"You often get clients who march into a property and immediately start saying, 'Oh, it's grossly overpriced',\" adds Chitnis. \"They're often just doing it to show off to their girlfriends, but they've painted themselves into a corner, and it's very difficult to do business with someone after they've made a confrontational statement like that.\" Then there are the gadget freaks. Basic questions about fixtures and fittings are, of course, to be expected, yet Chitnis says that he and his colleagues have been asked, for example, whether the view comes with the property, or if the seller is leaving the double-glazing behind. At the top end of the market, it goes way beyond carpets and curtains, so the agent has to do a lot of homework just to keep up: \"They ask about Lutron lighting, surround sound, Linn hi-fi sockets and different makes of plasma screen,\" says Lulu Egerton, residential director at Lane Fox. This kind of client is also obsessed by security and wardrobe space: \"They want to know where they can store the spring collection, the summer ensemble, and so on.\" The public's enthusiasm for feng shui is also not matched in the estate agent community: \"We get clients insisting on energy-flow diagrams, asking if the property has been dowsed,\" says Chitnis. Some clients believe that roads at junctions can let in evil spirits, and that walking past bedrooms to get to reception rooms is bad chi. \"One client was very insistent that there be no church bells in earshot. Apparently, these are a sign of death,\" says Egerton. \"Unfortunately, South Kensington, where she was looking, is full of churches.\" While most of us try hard to appear down-to-earth and sensible when house-hunting, the super-rich don't care how dotty they sound, and can afford the luxury of making preposterous demands. \"I recently took a well-known singer around a flat in Notting Hill, who stood staring out the window for about 10 minutes, apparently testing the karma,\" says Matthew Kaye of Chesterfield, in central London. Most frustrating of all, he says, was the house-hunter who dreamt of good fortune behind a red front door, and so would look only at houses that already had one. Many helpful vendors offered to get the Dulux out, but to no avail. The paintwork had to be old and peeling, as it was in the dream.",

      "body": "<p>'Terence,\" I said to my boss at the restaurant, Sir Terence Conran, \"just think of three dishes or ingredients that are favourites and that best please when placed in front of you or relax you most while preparing them.\" Such a request was hardly a problem for a man who has eaten very, very well for a very, very long time, and whose thoughts on food are as dogmatic as his thoughts on design. With a wistful smile, he conjured up memories of eating in Paris bistros in the 50s, and of many other best-loved dishes - such as fresh langoustines, a tomato salad, young grouse, late summer Scottish raspberries.</p> <p>Terence may be designer, restaurateur, entrepreneur and a good many other things besides, but the food that graces his own table is of the simplest, most unassuming and, always, best quality possible. \"Chic et simple,\" as the following menu of his choices shows.</p> <p>All recipes serve six.</p> <p><b>Crab soup</b></p> <p>Without a shred of hesitation, Terence wanted to start with very fresh langoustines, simply boiled and served up with a great bowl of mayonnaise. This was easily his most preferred starter: 'Delicious, but hardly a challenge for you,' he said with a grin. Of course, I should have responded that to make a truly great mayonnaise required considerable know-how, but that was not the point. No, he abandoned the idea of langoustines, mooted lobster briefly, before acknowledging that, unless caught off the coast of Scotland, that noble crustacean is rarely worth the money or effort.</p> <p>So, he thought, maybe crab would make an altogether better choice to kick off his ideal meal, perhaps in a bisque. Or, better still, in a good old proper soup, and invigorated by a richly spiced rouille (the French accompaniment to fish soup made from red chillis, garlic, olive oil, and breadcrumbs or potatoes) and some croutons.</p> <p>I couldn't have agreed more.</p> <p><b>1.2kg live crabs (at least)</b><br><b> 3 onions</b><br><b> 1 stick celery</b><br><b> 1 leek</b><br><b> 6 cloves garlic</b><br><b> 6 tomatoes</b><br><b> Olive oil</b><br><b> 1 tsp tomato pur\u00e9e</b><br><b> 300ml white wine</b><br><b> 1 bayleaf</b><br><b> 1 small sprig fresh thyme, tied</b><br><b> 12 black peppercorns</b><br><b> Pinch dried chilli</b><br><b> 1 sliver orange zest</b></p> <p>Do not kill the crabs until ready to use them. To do so, flip them over on to their backs, pull back the V-shaped flap on their undersides, then drive a metal spike through the exposed hole - the crab will be killed instantly and with the least pain possible. Using a cleaver or some such, violently bash the crab into tiny pieces, taking care to reserve all the liquid that flows from the body as you do so.</p> <p>Peel and finely chop the vegetables. Heat a generous slick of olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot, and in it fry the vegetables until softened. Stir in the tomato pur\u00e9e and continue to fry gently for five minutes. Add the crab, wine, herbs, spices and orange zest, pour in enough cold water barely to cover the crab, and bring the pot up to a simmer. Leave to cook for half an hour, stirring every now and then.</p> <p>Place a colander over a bucket or large bowl, and pour in the soup. Let the liquid drip through, squishing the bits of crab down with a spoon, to extract maximum flavour from them. Pass the soup liquid through a fine strainer into a clean pot and return to the boil. Taste the soup for seasoning, and reduce slightly if it seems too thin. Serve piping hot.</p> <p><b>Grilled rabbit</b></p> <p>The rabbit that is the normal fare of France and Italy is far removed from the all too often tough, wiry scunner that is native to the British Isles. Terence has a house in Provence called Brunellys (brown lilies), where they often cut up a rabbit into pieces, then steep it in a marinade of garlic, olive oil and herbs and leave to soak for a good few days. Then, cometh the cooking hour, a fire is lit, a grill laid on top and, when the flames have died and the embers glow quietly, the pieces of meat are laid on the grill. So good is this dish that it has become something of a fixture on the menu at the house. Served with some roast heads of garlic, some small potatoes, boiled and dressed with a little melted butter, and a salad of soft lettuce leaves dressed lightly in oil and vinegar, it makes for a particularly delightful meal. It's also delightfully simple.</p> <p><b>2 large or 3 small rabbits, skinned</b><br><b> Several large sprigs fresh rosemary</b><br><b> 1 small sprig fresh thyme</b><br><b> 8 cloves garlic</b><br><b> 4 bayleaves</b><br><b> 1 tsp cracked peppercorns</b><br><b> 200ml olive oil</b></p> <p>Remove the legs and shoulders from the rabbits and cut each saddle into three equal-sized pieces. Place the rabbit pieces in a bowl. Peel and slice the garlic, and add this to the bowl, along with the herbs, spices and olive oil. Cover the bowl, and place in the fridge for two or three days.</p> <p>Light the grill, or better still barbecue, and when good and hot, place the pieces of meat on a rack not too close to the fire. Leave to cook slowly until the meat is rich, brown and flecked with black, then turn and continue cooking until done. As each piece is cooked, place to the side of the grill so that it stays warm while the rest is cooking.</p> <p><b>Tarte tatin</b></p> <p>Terence's chosen pudding was, like all his dishes, a simple classic: tarte tatin, that most famous apple tart of all, in which the apples are baked under a thin pastry crust in a dark, rich toffee that impregnates them fully. However, he was torn between choosing apples and pears for this dessert. 'Pears do not belong in tarte tatin,' he acknowledged. 'Apples are the only fruit to use in that noble tart, and pears are just not welcome.' To Terence, a tarte tatin is a quintessential dessert.</p> <p>It may have few parts, but it is vital that each is flawless if the tart is to live up to its justified renown. It takes a bold cook to judge the sugar cooked to the correct degree - that is, when it has become a dark, rich caramel but is not scorched. After that, it's a more uncomplicated matter. The moment when the tart is unmoulded should be a moment of triumph: the apples all richly glossed with toffee, which oozes and runs through the fruit and into the pastry.</p> <p><b>12 crisp English eating apples</b><br><b> 1 lemon, juiced</b><br><b> 500g very good puff pastry</b><br><b> 85g caster sugar</b><br><b> 55g unsalted butter</b></p> <p>Preheat the oven to 175C/350F/gas mark 4. A heavy-bottomed, non-stick frying pan with an ovenproof handle is the best tool for the tart. Peel and core the apples, then pop them in a bowl with the lemon juice and toss them around. Cut off the bases of the apples to square them off, then cut the fruit in half. Put the frying pan over a medium flame, tip in the sugar and cook slowly until it attains a true caramel hue - that is, dark right though but not in the least burnt.</p> <p>Remove the pan from the heat, carefully swirl the butter into the caramel as it will be very, very hot. Place two halves of apple back together and place them in the middle of the pan. Pack more apples neatly and tightly around this centrepiece. Slice any remaining apple pieces, and use these to fill any gaps.</p> <p>Roll out the pastry to an even 3mm thickness, and then cut a disc of the pastry that will be large enough comfortably to flop over the sides of the pan. Gently lift up the pastry and let it fall loosely but smoothly over the apples and edges of the pan. Bake for 25-30 minutes, remove from the oven and leave to cool for 15 minutes then invert on to a handsome dish. Serve with some thick cream, if you wish (which I do)</p> <p>\u0095 Jeremy Lee is chef at Blue Print Cafe, Butlers Wharf, London SE1.</p>",

To do so, flip them over on to their backs, pull back the V-shaped flap on their undersides, then drive a metal spike through the exposed hole - the crab will be killed instantly and with the least pain possible. Using a cleaver or some such, violently bash the crab into tiny pieces, taking care to reserve all the liquid that flows from the body as you do so. Peel and finely chop the vegetables. Heat a generous slick of olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot, and in it fry the vegetables until softened. Stir in the tomato pur\u00e9e and continue to fry gently for five minutes. Add the crab, wine, herbs, spices and orange zest, pour in enough cold water barely to cover the crab, and bring the pot up to a simmer. Leave to cook for half an hour, stirring every now and then. Place a colander over a bucket or large bowl, and pour in the soup. Let the liquid drip through, squishing the bits of crab down with a spoon, to extract maximum flavour from them. Pass the soup liquid through a fine strainer into a clean pot and return to the boil. Taste the soup for seasoning, and reduce slightly if it seems too thin. Serve piping hot. Grilled rabbit The rabbit that is the normal fare of France and Italy is far removed from the all too often tough, wiry scunner that is native to the British Isles. Terence has a house in Provence called Brunellys (brown lilies), where they often cut up a rabbit into pieces, then steep it in a marinade of garlic, olive oil and herbs and leave to soak for a good few days. Then, cometh the cooking hour, a fire is lit, a grill laid on top and, when the flames have died and the embers glow quietly, the pieces of meat are laid on the grill. So good is this dish that it has become something of a fixture on the menu at the house. Served with some roast heads of garlic, some small potatoes, boiled and dressed with a little melted butter, and a salad of soft lettuce leaves dressed lightly in oil and vinegar, it makes for a particularly delightful meal. It's also delightfully simple. 2 large or 3 small rabbits, skinned Several large sprigs fresh rosemary 1 small sprig fresh thyme 8 cloves garlic 4 bayleaves 1 tsp cracked peppercorns 200ml olive oil Remove the legs and shoulders from the rabbits and cut each saddle into three equal-sized pieces. Place the rabbit pieces in a bowl. Peel and slice the garlic, and add this to the bowl, along with the herbs, spices and olive oil. Cover the bowl, and place in the fridge for two or three days. Light the grill, or better still barbecue, and when good and hot, place the pieces of meat on a rack not too close to the fire. Leave to cook slowly until the meat is rich, brown and flecked with black, then turn and continue cooking until done. As each piece is cooked, place to the side of the grill so that it stays warm while the rest is cooking. Tarte tatin Terence's chosen pudding was, like all his dishes, a simple classic: tarte tatin, that most famous apple tart of all, in which the apples are baked under a thin pastry crust in a dark, rich toffee that impregnates them fully. However, he was torn between choosing apples and pears for this dessert. 'Pears do not belong in tarte tatin,' he acknowledged. 'Apples are the only fruit to use in that noble tart, and pears are just not welcome.' To Terence, a tarte tatin is a quintessential dessert. It may have few parts, but it is vital that each is flawless if the tart is to live up to its justified renown. It takes a bold cook to judge the sugar cooked to the correct degree - that is, when it has become a dark, rich caramel but is not scorched. After that, it's a more uncomplicated matter. The moment when the tart is unmoulded should be a moment of triumph: the apples all richly glossed with toffee, which oozes and runs through the fruit and into the pastry. 12 crisp English eating apples 1 lemon, juiced 500g very good puff pastry 85g caster sugar 55g unsalted butter Preheat the oven to 175C/350F/gas mark 4. A heavy-bottomed, non-stick frying pan with an ovenproof handle is the best tool for the tart. Peel and core the apples, then pop them in a bowl with the lemon juice and toss them around. Cut off the bases of the apples to square them off, then cut the fruit in half. Put the frying pan over a medium flame, tip in the sugar and cook slowly until it attains a true caramel hue - that is, dark right though but not in the least burnt. Remove the pan from the heat, carefully swirl the butter into the caramel as it will be very, very hot. Place two halves of apple back together and place them in the middle of the pan. Pack more apples neatly and tightly around this centrepiece. Slice any remaining apple pieces, and use these to fill any gaps. Roll out the pastry to an even 3mm thickness, and then cut a disc of the pastry that will be large enough comfortably to flop over the sides of the pan. Gently lift up the pastry and let it fall loosely but smoothly over the apples and edges of the pan. Bake for 25-30 minutes, remove from the oven and leave to cool for 15 minutes then invert on to a handsome dish. Serve with some thick cream, if you wish (which I do) \u0095 Jeremy Lee is chef at Blue Print Cafe, Butlers Wharf, London SE1.",

Over-boiled: yolks brown, whites with texture of Michelin retreads. It's not rocket science. But you need to set that timer. Top tip: run hard-boiled eggs under cold water, then crack the shells to let air in while they cool. Makes peeling a doddle.",

Except that is exactly what is happening now, as a string of bad taste teenage \"gross-out\" movies bomb at the box office. Not so long ago, the runaway success of American Pie, Road Trip and the slasher spoof Scary Movie seemed to show the more moronic a movie could be, the more money it made. Teenagers, who make up nearly half of all cinema audiences, could not get enough toilet humour or the kind of wince-inducing visual jokes in which a sperm sample is mistaken for hair gel. There seemed to be no end to the trend - which spawned such purposefully sick shows as MTV's Jackass - until the past few weeks, when American adolescents have suddenly grown tired of politically incorrect comic gore, bouncing breasts and single entendres about Viagra that President George Bush has admitted he finds so amusing. Tomcats, the most heavily promoted teenage film ever - which made great play of its homage to Hannibal over its sad-lad hero eating a testicle - crashed when it opened a fortnight ago in the US, with an opening weekend take of a little over $8m (\u00a35.5m), a fraction of its advertising budget. Get Over It, starring Kirsten Dunst, and the teenage horror flick Valentine also died, while the slightly more restrained Sugar &amp; Spice sank without trace, too. Even the kings of the genre, the Farrelly brothers, the self-confessed \"warped minds\" behind Dumb and Dumber and There's Something About Mary, seem to have lost the knack of turning smut into brass. Say It Isn't So, a boy-meets-girl story of accidental incest - all done in the worst possible taste, of course - which they produced took a catastrophic $2.9m in its first weekend, hardly enough to pay for the premiere. But the brothers - who have been trying to make a comedy about conjoined twins called Stuck on You - refused to be cowed by the disaster and have managed to sign up Gwyneth Paltrow for their next film. This all might have been dismissed as a few isolated flops had the studios not been banking on the relatively cheap and fairly star-free teenage flicks to get them over a summer of threatened strikes by actors and writers. As it turned out, only the below-the-radar release of the small-budget See Spot Run - about a genius police dog with embarrassingly loose bowels - has done better than expected. The general malaise has even struck some of the young stars who emerged from the late 1990s vogue for slasher flicks and teen romances. Heart-throbs Scott Wolf and James Van Der Beek of Varsity Blues fame have found their careers becalmed, while even the \"scream queen\" herself, Neve Campbell, is struggling to find a decent role in grown-up films. Bruce Snyder of 20th Century Fox refuses to see it as a calamity and claims more stringent age guidelines on films have made them harder to sell to teenagers, who have traditionally found sneaking into films made for slightly older audiences part of the fun of going to the cinema. But Robert Mitchell, of Screen International, regards it more as poetic justice for studios whose cynicism and hunger to cash in on the likes of American Pie has rebounded. \"It is always the way that the second wave of these type of films have to be cruder than the first and often the joke begins to wear thin,\" he said. \"We could be on the verge of the backlash, or it could be that audiences just don't want to see inferior films trying to ape what went before. \"These sort of films have a great attraction for the studios. They are relatively cheap and are aimed squarely at the biggest group who go to films.\" Few of the gross-out films that have gone down in flames over the past month are likely to get the big release in Britain they might have been guaranteed last year. But Mr Mitchell said the real test of the genre would come this summer with the release of American Pie II and the Scary Movie sequel: \"If they don't work out like the studios hoped, it could be the beginning of the end of the gross-out movie.\" Whether the world would mourn its passing remains a moot point.

For nearly half a century scientific thinking has challenged the concept that there are different races of human beings. In July 1952 Unesco issued a statement prepared by an international grouping of geneticists and anthropologists to the effect that all human beings belong to one single species, homo sapiens, and that there is no evidence for the existence of human races.

For nearly half a century scientific thinking has challenged the concept that there are different races of human beings. In July 1952 Unesco issued a statement prepared by an international grouping of geneticists and anthropologists to the effect that all human beings belong to one single species, homo sapiens, and that there is no evidence for the existence of human races. Subsequent studies, including the recently published draft human genome, have shown that human beings are one of the most genetically homogeneous species and that we all share over 99.9% of our 30,000 or so genes.

These bigots have declared they will be voting Labour. If ever a politician was playing the race card, it's Robin Cook (Report, April 19). Jarod Weaver Southwell, Notts",

      "bodyText": "Perhaps it is not surprising that the leading UK football clubs have the best youth development strategies when you consider the time they spend identifying and developing the qualities that are the hallmark of young players such as Steven Gerrard of Liverpool or Wes Brown at Manchester United. But instead of Manchester United or Liverpool consider EuroDirect - a European market leader in the database marketing industry - and understand that, whether an organisation is searching for the next David Beckham or for a top marketing analyst, the same challenge is a facet of staff recruitment. So how does an employer approach the task of spotting something as elusive as \"personal qualities\" in its recruitment wish-list, when limited to the intelligence gathered from stage-managed interviews and \"sexy\" CVs that are economical with the truth? The approach to recruitment and staff development of EuroDirect, Skipton Building Society's marketing offshoot, mirrors that of top soccer teams. To spot and grow its own talent it has teamed up with the School of Geography at the University of Leeds. This link with a local higher education institution offers a valuable lesson for other companies wanting to recruit the brightest and the best. There is evidence that the relationship between higher educational institutions and employers is changing. This is principally a corollary of the new service- and IT-related occupations that flourish in the UK's post-industrial economy; the steady expansion of the proportion of young people who enrol for higher education; and the evolution in expectations of graduates and employers. Although universities and colleges offer a wide range of courses, few students become archaeologists, philosophers, or marine biologists. This does not invalidate the worth of broad-ranging courses because, along with the life-skills \"learning\" implicit with independent student life, they produce highly employable graduates. In reality, however, new employees still have much to learn before they achieve commercially acceptable standards. This reflects the rapid rate of change in business perspectives rather than any shortfall in the quality of courses. EuroDirect has kept a traditional recruitment approach using advertisements and interviews, but this is largely used to hire experienced staff. Yet internal promotions fill the majority of its management positions. How then does the School of Geography help the company's recruitment strategy? First of all, it is clear that, apart from a high academic rating, the School of Geography at Leeds is special in other ways, particularly in terms of its willingness to accept responsibility for a role in graduate employment. This is maintained through specific taught modules and a willingness to deal with the business world. Senior EuroDirect staff noted these characteristics during the 1990s and enduring connections were established. Departmental staff, such as school chairman Graham Clarke, working closely with students, were happy to match the qualities of graduates with those required for available jobs. Proper interview procedures were maintained, but EuroDirect could approach its initial meeting with prospective employees safe in the knowledge that the school had enjoyed a three-year relationship with each candidate. It soon became routine for EuroDirect to contact the school whenever graduate recruits were required and it gained huge confidence in the quality of its recruits. The fact that, to date, all staff recruited in this way remain at EuroDirect, is real evidence of the successful \"match\" of recruit to employer. The relationship has not stopped here. EuroDirect has enrolled senior analysts on advanced statistics courses jointly sponsored by the company and the school, and eight staff are in postgraduate studies. EuroDirect's association with the School of Geography has clearly been mutually beneficial. Graduate and postgraduate students of the School now make up 25% of EuroDirect staff and the School can rebut any accusation of living in an ivory tower by pointing to its relevance to the hard-nosed commercial world. From a broader perspective, the EuroDirect story signposts an innovative route to recruitment that, given imagination and commitment from employers and academia, will ensure that top-quality staff and businesses find themselves playing in the same team. \u0095 Dr Martin Bradbury is Client Services Manager of EuroDirect.",

When did you first become a manager? In 1983, when I became head of a software department writing software for spy satellites. What has been your best moment in management? There are several. When you run your business based on a vision and when that works in practice, it makes me very happy each time. What was your greatest mistake? Believing that western managers know more than their Russian counterparts. Which deal would you most like to have done? Seeing Russian technology being embedded in Sun Micro Systems security software. What do you find most annoying in your staff? That it takes me a lot of effort to convince them before they share my vision. What management wisdom is most over-rated? Experience. It can help, but it can also sometimes stand in the way. What is the one lesson you have learned that you would pass on to young managers? Never be afraid to make new mistakes. Who is your management hero? Sergei Pavlovich Korolev, the driving force behind the Soviet space programme, and Jack Welch, of General Electric US. Who is your favourite politician? Nelson Mandela, for enduring personal suffering and still being dedicated to bringing peace and reconciliation. Do you think European executives are overpaid? In a start-up it is normal to take a cut in your income but you expect that to be more than compensated for by stock gains in the future. European managers are not willing to do that. They don't seem to be prepared to invest in their future. If you could change one aspect of British business, what would it be? Make the borders more open. For business people outside the EC it is a real hassle to enter the UK. What phrase or saying do you most over-use? Since we used so many slogans in the Soviet era, I'm very conscious about glib phrases. What annoys you most? Answering the irrelevant questions of immigration officials because I have a Russian passport. How do you relax? Skiing downhill. What is your favourite city? If I can have two, they would be San Francisco and Moscow. What is your greatest regret? No longer having the time to climb mountains. What is your biggest fear? That immoral politicians will misuse the power of the internet and other cool technologies to control people. What would you really like to have been? In each stage in one's life you have a different idea of what you want to become. At this stage, I am happy being myself.",

The fertility of successful careerists has been brought into the open with the announcement of junior health minister Yvette Cooper's planned maternity leave, followed shortly after by the shock news for business pages of the pregnancy of Debenhams' chief executive, Belinda Earl, only months after her appointment. The business inconvenience of women's predilection for pregnancy as the last line of defence of die-hard chauvinists is blown out of the water when the company is deliver ing above average results in a struggling retail market.

Sahar was at a career crossroads and decided visiting her brother Bobby would be the perfect respite. While eating out at a Thai restaurant, Sahar mentioned to Bobby how much she yearned for New York's skinny cappuccinos and fat-free muffins when back home in London.</p> <p>Bobby, an investment banker, knew his sister was seeking a new challenge after five years as a solicitor in the City and suggested she look at running her own coffee shop. He even offered to pay her to do the research.</p> <p>Back in London, Sahar spent endless hours in a business library carrying out research and, on one memorable day, spent five weary hours getting off every station on the Circle line to inspect the coffee bars. She concluded that Londoners were compromising on quality, which didn't surprise her since she had never found a decent cup of coffee while working in the City.</p> <p>The Department of Trade and Industry backed the proposed coffee venture with a \u00a375,000 loan. Then, in November 1995, a year after Sahar's chance remark over a Thai meal, the first Coffee Republic was opened in central London's upmarket South Molton Street.</p> <p>\"The whole idea of Coffee Republic was to offer coffee that met individual requirements. Our customers can have semi-skimmed coffee, iced coffee as many shots dry or wet (dry is lots of foam, wet is less foam) and can flavour it with cinnamon, nutmeg and honey.\"</p> <p>Despite the wide range of choice, business got off to a slow start. \"People weren't used to fancy names for coffee like macchiato, skinny latte and mocha, so we encountered slow sales, plus difficulty in finding and keeping staff.\"</p> <p>The siblings had no intention of giving up. They hired a PR company, which led to a few favourable press articles.</p> <p>By spring 1996, the business began to pick up and in December that year, the second coffee shop was opened in central London. \"In October 1997, we reversed into a public company on the Alternative Investment Market and that helped us raise \u00a38.5m for further expansion,\" says Sahar.</p> <p>\"In July 2000 we went on to the main London stock exchange. We have now raised a total of \u00a325m, enough to open 40 coffee bars a year. We've gone from no bars to 82 in exactly five years,\" she says. The latest, in London's Hanover Street, opened last week.</p> <p>Behind Coffee Republic's phenomenal growth are more than 800 employees in coffee bars around the country, including Manchester, Birmingham and Cardiff.</p> <p>Overseeing staff and the business is a strong team of directors, she says. Sahar and Bobby no longer get involved in the company's day-to-day running, but remain very much hands-on. Bobby is Coffee Republic's creative director and Sahar is the brand marketing director.</p> <p>Sahar's role entails visiting a branch of Coffee Republic for breakfast every day. \"I go in as a customer, judge it as a customer and stay for an hour. I make sure the quality remains the same and true to the Coffee Republic spirit.\"</p> <p>Though Sahar's lifestyle is more relaxed she still has to work hard. \"My ethos is that success is 99% perspiration and 1% inspiration. The goal is to make sure we don't be come a big corporate company, forgetting why and how we started.\"</p> <p>Sahar credits her legal training with enabling her to run the business so successfully. \"It gives you amazing discipline and structures your mind,\" she says. \"I don't think I could have started Coffee Republic without it.\"</p> <p>Iranian-born Sahar embarked on a law career after studying at Bristol University. She was excited when taken on by City law firm Frere Cholmeley but became dissatisfied.</p> <p>\"I started getting bored with not seeing the fruits of my labour. I would give advice to clients, but I wanted to make things happen.\"</p> <p>After her father died suddenly in 1994, she quit her job and took a five-month break in Argentina to learn Spanish. On her return she started job-hunting but with little success.</p> <p>Fed up, she decided to take that long weekend break to New York. \"It was the best thing I ever did,\" she enthuses.</p>",

The Department of Trade and Industry backed the proposed coffee venture with a \u00a375,000 loan. Then, in November 1995, a year after Sahar's chance remark over a Thai meal, the first Coffee Republic was opened in central London's upmarket South Molton Street. \"The whole idea of Coffee Republic was to offer coffee that met individual requirements. Our customers can have semi-skimmed coffee, iced coffee as many shots dry or wet (dry is lots of foam, wet is less foam) and can flavour it with cinnamon, nutmeg and honey.\" Despite the wide range of choice, business got off to a slow start. \"People weren't used to fancy names for coffee like macchiato, skinny latte and mocha, so we encountered slow sales, plus difficulty in finding and keeping staff.\" The siblings had no intention of giving up. They hired a PR company, which led to a few favourable press articles. By spring 1996, the business began to pick up and in December that year, the second coffee shop was opened in central London. \"In October 1997, we reversed into a public company on the Alternative Investment Market and that helped us raise \u00a38.5m for further expansion,\" says Sahar. \"In July 2000 we went on to the main London stock exchange. We have now raised a total of \u00a325m, enough to open 40 coffee bars a year. We've gone from no bars to 82 in exactly five years,\" she says. The latest, in London's Hanover Street, opened last week. Behind Coffee Republic's phenomenal growth are more than 800 employees in coffee bars around the country, including Manchester, Birmingham and Cardiff. Overseeing staff and the business is a strong team of directors, she says. Sahar and Bobby no longer get involved in the company's day-to-day running, but remain very much hands-on. Bobby is Coffee Republic's creative director and Sahar is the brand marketing director. Sahar's role entails visiting a branch of Coffee Republic for breakfast every day. \"I go in as a customer, judge it as a customer and stay for an hour. I make sure the quality remains the same and true to the Coffee Republic spirit.\" Though Sahar's lifestyle is more relaxed she still has to work hard. \"My ethos is that success is 99% perspiration and 1% inspiration. The goal is to make sure we don't be come a big corporate company, forgetting why and how we started.\" Sahar credits her legal training with enabling her to run the business so successfully. \"It gives you amazing discipline and structures your mind,\" she says. \"I don't think I could have started Coffee Republic without it.\" Iranian-born Sahar embarked on a law career after studying at Bristol University. She was excited when taken on by City law firm Frere Cholmeley but became dissatisfied. \"I started getting bored with not seeing the fruits of my labour. I would give advice to clients, but I wanted to make things happen.\" After her father died suddenly in 1994, she quit her job and took a five-month break in Argentina to learn Spanish. On her return she started job-hunting but with little success. Fed up, she decided to take that long weekend break to New York. \"It was the best thing I ever did,\" she enthuses.",

Or it could be during a quiet moment when, as you're checking your emails, you lose sight of what you're doing, and wonder whether there really is more to life.</p> <p>Thoughts turn to \"giving something back\" or using your skills for something more worthwhile, but you know that making a move to a not-for-profit organisation would involve a serious change in lifestyle. It's a tough one.</p> <p>Yet as charities market themselves with increasing ferocity and the so-called corporate baddies are having to do environmental and ethical housekeeping to make sure they don't lose out when consumers make informed choices between brands - is the divide between the commercial and voluntary sectors so clearly marked? And, when it comes to carving a career in either , who's to say that you can't mix and match and move between the two? Surely there are skills to be learned in each camp?</p> <p>\"There used to be a thing about what the commercial sector did one day, the voluntary sector would do a few years later, but I think the gap is narrowing,\" says Jim Minton, director of marketing at Centrepoint, the London-based charity that provides accommodation, education and training for 16-25-year-olds who are homeless. Mr Minton used to be a sales manager for Bass, looking after 100 pubs. He left the brewing world to work for Shelter doing account management of trusts and foundations and is now intent on building the Centrepoint brand.</p> <p>So was selling beer a good training ground for selling a charity?</p> <p>\"There is a parallel,\" he says. \"You're going round pubs and they've got to buy their beer from somewhere. It's really down to relationships. It's the same with trusts and foundations. They've got money to give away and if they can believe in the organisation through you, you've got a fair chance of getting money from them\".</p> <p>Yet what about taking what he has learned and going back to Bass?</p> <p>\"At the moment I'm building quite a good career in the voluntary sector. I'm good at it, and I know what I can do. Skills could definitely be transferred back. Although I don't think I could take the Centrepoint brand experience and go back to Bass and say: 'I want to be the Carling brand manager'. It's not going to happen.\"</p> <p>Nevertheless, Mr Minton is studying for a MBA in his spare time and he seems happy speaking in the jargon of a brand manager in any blue chip company. If Centrepoint were a fashion brand, which brand would it be?</p> <p>\"Diesel, French Connection, Gap,\" says Mr Minton, needing little time for deliberation. \"We're adamant that we don't want to be a bog standard, free biro, charity brand. We want to be our own brand.\"</p> <p>Yet just as other high street brands compete with each other, so must charities. This competition often means charities are perceived to be spending more and more of donors' money on extravagant advertising and direct marketing campaigns which naturally invite criticism.</p> <p>\"I think a lot of people don't understand how charities operate. I didn't have a clue before I came here,\" admits Wendy Brown, who left financial services consulting at PricewaterhouseCoopers to work for Save the Children.</p> <p>\"A lot of work goes into the gap between somebody handing over some cash into a collection box and the money reaching a child in Africa living on less than a dollar a day.\"</p> <p>Ms Brown is communications coordinator for the UN Special Session on Children that is taking place in September. For the first time, children are being invited to be delegates. Save the Children is trying to help governments around the world to include children in their delegation and to help children to be heard at the event.</p> <p>Since starting her job in January Ms Brown is enjoying her new working environment. \"Working with children is quite an emotional issue so people tend to be more passionate, although some people can get passionate about mortgages,\" she admits.</p> <p>But what benefits is she bringing to Save the Children?</p> <p>\"I guess the answer is a different perspective. I suppose that can hinder in that it takes me longer to understand where other people are coming from but at the same time perhaps I'm thinking in a slightly more commercial way and that creates a good balance.\" Ms Brown's contract ends in September, after which she would definitely consider something else at Save the Children if it came up.</p> <p>But is it generally easy to make a move into the charitable sector?</p> <p>\"It's easier at the lower levels\", admits Cathy Daniels, account director at specialist recruitment agency Charity People. \"And finance people do it. People in their mid to late 20s and early to mid 30s are most likely to do it, particularly people who've worked in agencies or consultancies. They've quite often worked hard in an agency environment where there's a lot of dissatisfaction and their social life suffers,\" she explains.</p> <p>Ms Daniels is on the look-out for people with good marketing, communications and business development skills, all of which are directly transferable to fund raising. \"And good general management and administrative skills,\" she adds. With a database of 4,000 clients and 80,000 candidates, the market is \"buoyant\". \"We don't have to do a lot of new business,\" she admits.</p> <p>And at the National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO), work is being done to shift perceptions about working in not-for-profit organisations. \"Some people think the pay in the voluntary sector is really, really bad,\" says Ben Kernighan, who has been involved with producing the brochure: Working for a Better World, which helps to set the record straight. \"Pay at the more junior level is often comparable with the private sector. But at the higher level, you don't get the astronomical salaries you get in the commercial sector.\"</p> <p>Which is something that Martin Brookes, former senior economist at Goldman Sachs has had to \"resolve in his head\" before joining Amnesty International as a researcher in economic relations and human rights.</p> <p>\"There was a nagging doubt at the back of my mind that said: 'Do you really want to be doing this for the next 30 years, or is there something you can do which you would feel more comfortable with when you wake up in the morning and go into work'?\"</p> <p>The new role for Martin Brookes also represents something of a departure for Amnesty. And what is his role exactly? \"As I've defined it to myself so far,\" he says, \"it's essentially trying to link economics to human rights. Part of it will be trying to think about how we get companies to be conscious of their role in improving human rights in the countries in which they operate and also to see that they don't violate human rights through their own operations.\"</p> <p>His job will entail working closely with Amnesty researchers around the world. \"It's fascinating,\" he says. \"In the past I was looking at economics for economics' sake but now I'm looking at economics for human rights' sake. That is the shift\".</p> <p>One of the cultural shocks for Mr Brookes is the fact that Amnesty is an organisation heaving with lawyers. \"Economists have a completely different way of doing things. Lawyers are very procedural by nature whereas economists are just interested in an idea or a problem and how to get an end result.\"</p> <p>So does that mean that Amnesty International is buried under red tape? \"There is more structure here,\" says Mr Brookes diplomatically. \"Although I came from an institution that is probably the least bureaucratic place that I can imagine. In the whole time I was at Goldman Sachs I probably only wrote one memo.\"</p> <p>Was it difficult to make the move from a leading investment bank to a leading human rights organisation?</p> <p>\"As soon as I had the interview here I was very keen to do the job,\" he says. \"And my colleagues were very understanding. No one said: 'You're mad' although when some of them said: 'That's very brave' they might have really meant: 'You're completely mad'.\" But surely it must be great to have left a pressured environment to to spend your days having cosy chats with co-workers about the bigger picture? Rather than just putting the world to rights in the pub, it must feel so much better if you're genuinely trying to do something that makes a difference.</p> <p>\"This is not about putting your feet up,\" cautions Mr Brookes. \"It does feel more relaxed, but I'm not sure if that's because I'm very new and once we're working on projects it might get as busy as Goldman Sachs, although without the intensity of the markets moving.\"</p> <p>One thing is certain. The differences between the commercial and not-for-profit sectors may not be so easy to define in clich\u00e9s - greedy capitalists versus do-gooders - in the future. And in career terms, it might mean there are new opportunities for people who want to combine passion and purpose with strategic career development.</p> <p>\"I've followed my heart to do this, but it's also intellectual, and this is the crux of it. It's a new area and it's one that's not going to disappear. It doesn't rule out going back to the City at some point - particularly with the growth of things like ethical investment and business and social responsibility. It's actually a combination of something emotional and something intellectually challenging.
