Sadly, it's also a provincial Carmen - too clean by half and lacking in lust.

There has been no corner-cutting on research - North keeps to the original 19th-century short story by Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e and looks to Goya and Gustave Dor\u00e9 for visual inspiration. The design is neatly efficient, allowing one set of big wooden tables to become the prison, the tobacco factory, a riverbank, the bullring and the gallows just by moving them around and turning them over. </p> <p>Written specially for this ballet, the score by composer Christopher Benstead illuminates the dance without overtly competing with it. In the programme he says he's looking for a filmic quality; he's got it. The music bends and turns in waves with the action, never imposing, always in step. Despite his deference, though, the music holds most of the emotional cards. Spanish songs sung with modest beauty by Annique Burms and Stephen Ashfield act as our guide to Carmen and Don Jose's feelings. Three guitars, a solo trumpet, an accordian and an ever-present percussion add a little heat. Although there is nothing grand about this interpretation - it is certainly not Carmen as we know it - Benstead delivers something soothingly attractive. </p> <p>The dance, by contrast, dreams its way through love and murder with an anonymous, rather chilly detachment. Carmen's proud spirit seems tamed and Don Jose's passion hardly seems murderous. Lorna Scott and Ivan Dinev are well-matched but their title roles are set in fable rather than drama. The company are comfortable in this contemporary ballet with a flick of flamenco and folk but it does not take them to the scary, risky and, ultimately, tragic world in which a gypsy girl practises sexual freedom and dies for it. </p> <p>We're told to expect passion, jealousy and obsession.

The Cat standard is expected to require similar features, but the card account offered through the Post Office would allow account holders only to withdraw cash over its counters. </p> <p>There would be no direct debit facility, making the account nothing more than an electronic benefits service. </p> <p>\"It is absolutely inconceivable that the Treasury will not demand that you should be able to set up direct debits from these basic bank accounts,\" one source said. \"The government would be contravening its own guidelines.\" </p> <p>This is the latest hurdle in the tortuous negotiations to create the universal bank, which the high street banks warned last year could carry the stigma of a poor people's bank. </p> <p>The post office-based bank has two main aims; first, to provide bank accounts for social security claimants who will need one when the benefits system is automated; and second, to throw a lifeline to the 18,000-strong post office network by finding a way to plug the \u00a3400m in revenue that the Post Office will lose when social security payments are paid directly into bank accounts. </p> <p>Under the deal between the banks and the government, the banks will contribute \u00a3150m a year to the Post Office. The banks will offer their basic bank accounts - with direct debit and cash machine facilities - through their own branches and The Post Office. </p> <p>At the same time, the Post Office will offer its much simpler card account, which can only be used over its counters.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The government's troubled project to create a post office bank faces fresh criticism this week - this time for offering accounts to the financially excluded which do not reach the standards demanded from the high street banks. The attempt to create bank accounts for about 4m social security claimants is already behind schedule and unlikely to come to fruition before the general election. Indeed, it is still far from clear if any of the 10 main banking groups have officially signed the proposal. Now senior sources are warning that the Department of Trade and Industry is on a collision course with the Treasury because the new, simple post office bank accounts are unlikely to meet the Treasury's Cat (charges, access and terms) standard. The Treasury has just completed a consultation exercise with the high street banks to produce a Cat standard, which sets out the minimum requirements for these basic bank accounts. Last year the Treasury demanded that the banks make basic accounts available through their own branches and The Post Office, which would not allow the customer to overdraw but would provide facilities to use cash machines and set up direct debits. The Cat standard is expected to require similar features, but the card account offered through the Post Office would allow account holders only to withdraw cash over its counters. There would be no direct debit facility, making the account nothing more than an electronic benefits service. \"It is absolutely inconceivable that the Treasury will not demand that you should be able to set up direct debits from these basic bank accounts,\" one source said. \"The government would be contravening its own guidelines.\" This is the latest hurdle in the tortuous negotiations to create the universal bank, which the high street banks warned last year could carry the stigma of a poor people's bank. The post office-based bank has two main aims; first, to provide bank accounts for social security claimants who will need one when the benefits system is automated; and second, to throw a lifeline to the 18,000-strong post office network by finding a way to plug the \u00a3400m in revenue that the Post Office will lose when social security payments are paid directly into bank accounts. Under the deal between the banks and the government, the banks will contribute \u00a3150m a year to the Post Office. The banks will offer their basic bank accounts - with direct debit and cash machine facilities - through their own branches and The Post Office. At the same time, the Post Office will offer its much simpler card account, which can only be used over its counters.",

Two years ago Carlisle goalkeeper Jimmy Glass went up for a corner in the fifth minute of injury time and scored the goal that kept his side in the League. 'No one marks you,' he explains. 'I'm six feet four inches, I've got a history of scoring goals and no one marks me. So whatever madness there is to it there's some sanity too.' </p> <p>It proved to be not just 'the most staggering story of the day' but the most wonderful non-Premiership story for many a year. Yet for Jimmy Glass it was his one moment in the sun during a decade of drudgery. He is the goalkeeper who is famous for scoring one goal. Now, at the age of 27 and after being relegated with Kingstonian, he is on the verge of jacking it in. When we meet, Jimmy is on his way to Carlisle to help out a Supporters Association who have raised money to buy two seats on the board. 'I'll meet the media, do TV, go round the pubs and clubs to meet the fans. I love all that,' he says. 'It was just my luck that I became a legend as far away from my house as I possibly could.' He is effusive as he looks back on the one-shot career that came to a premature end: angry, confused, disappointed, but not bitter. Anxious to tell it as it was and is. </p> <p>He was let go by Chelsea, signed as a pro by Crystal Palace, sent to Bournemouth, and then made his way to Swindon. 'I thought, \"This is my step up.\" I got on fine with [manager] Steve McMahon to start with but for the opening match Steve played Frank Talia.' Initially, Glass fared better with new boss Jimmy Quinn. 'I played two games. We lost 4-0 to QPR in the first and in the next I was injured, there was no keeper on the bench and I had to play on and we lost 6-0. My ankle was twice the size of my head and it was obvious I wasn't fit to play and he goes to the paper and says, \"Frank's playing in the next game\". Oh, it's like that, is it? 'Two weeks later he said, \"Carlisle have phoned, do you fancy it?\" and me being uneducated in a football way said, \"Sure\", not knowing that they were bottom of the Third Division. And when I went to Carlisle I was shitting myself because I hadn't played any League games - well, I'd played two and let in 10 goals - and if I bollocks it up they're out of the league.' Instead, he saved them. Back to Swindon. 'Quinny said, \"You've done really good, but if I get an offer you can leave.\" So that was Swindon.' </p> <p>Swindon said Carlisle could have him for \u00a315,000. 'Bloody non-league players go for 50k and I thought, \"Crikey, show us a bit of respect, fellas,\" and [then Carlisle owner] Michael Knighton said he didn't want me. I was only 25, he would have made money on me.' The source of disagreement was wages. Glass wanted an extra 10 grand a year for keeping them in the League, Knighton wasn't prepared to pay. 'I'm pretty sure I wouldn't even have been top earner.' Still at Swindon. 'I played eight games and my form was picking up and we went to Bolton and we got battered. Hammered. I made five or six saves. It's pissing down with rain and this geezer hits a shot and I go down the wrong way and it's my fault and I put my hand up. That's goalkeeping. 'They nick another. We lose 2-0. </p> <p>Quinn comes in and says to me \"I'm embarrassed, I'm embarrassed for the fans, that's just crap\". And bearing in mind I'm an argumentative sod I said very little. And then he really personally attacked me in the press.' (Pause). 'He basically just personally attacked me. And it was splashed all over the Sunday papers even though I still got Man of the Match. That was the last game I played for Swindon.' </p> <p>In the Sunday Mirror it was reported that Quinn said: 'Frankly it was embarrassing. The ball was only travelling at two-and-a-half miles an hour and it's gone into our net. I may have to start looking for a new goalkeeper because this sort of thing keeps happening.' In the The News of the World , however: 'The keeper performed heroics.' Quinn never apologised. 'Once you lose your honesty it all goes Pete Tong,' says Glass. 'The damage Quinny inflicts on you goes with you.' </p> <p>Glass had short spells at Cambridge and Oxford - 'They didn't even have a training ground, let alone a keeper coach.' Then Kingstonian and now... 'I've had only a year's coaching in 12 years in the game. Every club I've been at as soon as they hit financial difficulties the first thing to go is the keeper coach. I'd love to coach but not in the current climate. I'd like to run a subsidised coaching centre where the kids could go for the love of the game. </p> <p>'Football is bigger than United, Beckham or Murdoch. Football's a great spectacle - a beautiful thing - and it's big ger than the Premiership. I think the FA is to blame because the game hasn't been shaped properly like in other nations. The worst thing that happened was winning the World Cup. Because we're an arrogant nation and we just stuck our head up our arses for 30 years. And now the structure is like an upside-down pyramid with everything at the top and when that collapses... ' </p> <p>Glass is an honest, intelligent man - qualities which probably hindered his football career but will benefit the book he is currently writing on what's wrong with the game. As he leaves he says: 'I've neither succeeded nor failed. When I'm 50 I can always get the cuttings books out and say I made history. I might be sitting in a caravan but I could always do that.'</p>",

Yet for Jimmy Glass it was his one moment in the sun during a decade of drudgery. He is the goalkeeper who is famous for scoring one goal. Now, at the age of 27 and after being relegated with Kingstonian, he is on the verge of jacking it in. When we meet, Jimmy is on his way to Carlisle to help out a Supporters Association who have raised money to buy two seats on the board. 'I'll meet the media, do TV, go round the pubs and clubs to meet the fans. I love all that,' he says. 'It was just my luck that I became a legend as far away from my house as I possibly could.' He is effusive as he looks back on the one-shot career that came to a premature end: angry, confused, disappointed, but not bitter. Anxious to tell it as it was and is. He was let go by Chelsea, signed as a pro by Crystal Palace, sent to Bournemouth, and then made his way to Swindon. 'I thought, \"This is my step up.\" I got on fine with [manager] Steve McMahon to start with but for the opening match Steve played Frank Talia.' Initially, Glass fared better with new boss Jimmy Quinn. 'I played two games. We lost 4-0 to QPR in the first and in the next I was injured, there was no keeper on the bench and I had to play on and we lost 6-0. My ankle was twice the size of my head and it was obvious I wasn't fit to play and he goes to the paper and says, \"Frank's playing in the next game\". Oh, it's like that, is it? 'Two weeks later he said, \"Carlisle have phoned, do you fancy it?\" and me being uneducated in a football way said, \"Sure\", not knowing that they were bottom of the Third Division. And when I went to Carlisle I was shitting myself because I hadn't played any League games - well, I'd played two and let in 10 goals - and if I bollocks it up they're out of the league.' Instead, he saved them. Back to Swindon. 'Quinny said, \"You've done really good, but if I get an offer you can leave.\" So that was Swindon.' Swindon said Carlisle could have him for \u00a315,000. 'Bloody non-league players go for 50k and I thought, \"Crikey, show us a bit of respect, fellas,\" and [then Carlisle owner] Michael Knighton said he didn't want me. I was only 25, he would have made money on me.' The source of disagreement was wages. Glass wanted an extra 10 grand a year for keeping them in the League, Knighton wasn't prepared to pay. 'I'm pretty sure I wouldn't even have been top earner.' Still at Swindon. 'I played eight games and my form was picking up and we went to Bolton and we got battered. Hammered. I made five or six saves. It's pissing down with rain and this geezer hits a shot and I go down the wrong way and it's my fault and I put my hand up. That's goalkeeping. 'They nick another. We lose 2-0. Quinn comes in and says to me \"I'm embarrassed, I'm embarrassed for the fans, that's just crap\". And bearing in mind I'm an argumentative sod I said very little. And then he really personally attacked me in the press.' (Pause). 'He basically just personally attacked me. And it was splashed all over the Sunday papers even though I still got Man of the Match. That was the last game I played for Swindon.' In the Sunday Mirror it was reported that Quinn said: 'Frankly it was embarrassing. The ball was only travelling at two-and-a-half miles an hour and it's gone into our net. I may have to start looking for a new goalkeeper because this sort of thing keeps happening.' In the The News of the World , however: 'The keeper performed heroics.' Quinn never apologised. 'Once you lose your honesty it all goes Pete Tong,' says Glass. 'The damage Quinny inflicts on you goes with you.' Glass had short spells at Cambridge and Oxford - 'They didn't even have a training ground, let alone a keeper coach.' Then Kingstonian and now... 'I've had only a year's coaching in 12 years in the game. Every club I've been at as soon as they hit financial difficulties the first thing to go is the keeper coach. I'd love to coach but not in the current climate. I'd like to run a subsidised coaching centre where the kids could go for the love of the game. 'Football is bigger than United, Beckham or Murdoch. Football's a great spectacle - a beautiful thing - and it's big ger than the Premiership. I think the FA is to blame because the game hasn't been shaped properly like in other nations. The worst thing that happened was winning the World Cup. Because we're an arrogant nation and we just stuck our head up our arses for 30 years. And now the structure is like an upside-down pyramid with everything at the top and when that collapses... ' Glass is an honest, intelligent man - qualities which probably hindered his football career but will benefit the book he is currently writing on what's wrong with the game. As he leaves he says: 'I've neither succeeded nor failed. When I'm 50 I can always get the cuttings books out and say I made history. I might be sitting in a caravan but I could always do that.'",

My tour, with British Airways Holidays, started with an overnight flight to Bangkok arriving on Thursday afternoon. In theory, I could have whisked around the city and taken in a few temples; in practice I found the luscious precincts of the Oriental Hotel rather difficult to leave. By evening I thought I should make some effort to see Bangkok so I took the hotel launch across the river to the hotel spa where I had a yummy jetlag massage in a sandalwood panelled room and fell fast asleep. Super place, Bangkok. </p> <p>Next morning it was off to the airport for the short flight to Siem Reap in Cambodia. I am tempted here to make some crappy generalisation about the happy, giggling, smiling Thais and the silent, stricken, war-scarred Cambodians but given the brevity of my acquaintance with the populations of both countries, I will forbear. </p> <p>Still, you can't help finding Cambodia grim after Thailand. The civil war, which wiped out a whole generation, is a very recent memory; there are posters warning about land mines everywhere (and plenty of limbless beggars who emphasise the point). Cambodia is now encouraging tourism like mad, and Siem Reap, the base for Angkor Wat, is a boom town with new hotels opening every month, but it still feels raw and provisional. </p> <p>We stayed at the Grand Hotel d'Angkor, which was founded in 1932 - in the French colonial period - and has an elegant Art Deco feel.

Having effortlessly adjusted to the concept of whistlestop tourism, this seemed a bit slow - two whole days chuntering through Thailand? But the scenery was stunning - emerald fields with egrets and kingfishers everywhere, and prawn ponds weirdly striplit at night, fantastically shaped craggy mountains in the distance, a milky white haze at dawn. It is so beautiful, Thailand, I can see why everyone who goes gets hooked. </p> <p>We stopped to see the Bridge on the River Kwai and to take a boat trip to the cemetery where many of the PoWs who worked on the death railway are buried. It is a beautiful spot - not remotely reminiscent of the bridge in the film, which was shot in Sri Lanka. The next day we entered Malaysia and saw rubber plantations. I thought rubber trees were stiff plastic things that lived in offices and needed dusting, but they are as graceful and shivery as larches. </p> <p>We visited Georgetown, the old colonial capital of Penang Island, where we were whisked round in trishaws, sprawling in big comfortable armchairs with tiny old men cycling like mad behind. Then overnight through Malaysia, and across the causeway into Singapore. </p> <p>The train is beautifully designed, with marquetry panelling and Art-Nouveau fittings, apparently inspired by the 1932 film Shanghai Express.

Singapore - you make my heart sing! Everyone told me I would find it dull - it is so clean and law-abiding that there is an automatic death penalty for drug trafficking, and you can go to prison for dropping litter or importing chewing-gum. Maybe it's a sign of age that I can forgo the delights of litter and chewing-gum and drug trafficking but I loved the energy of Singapore, the bristling thicket of skyscrapers in the middle, the acres of reclaimed land now green as a golf course but soon to be planted with more skyscrapers, the marina with its little pleasure boats and tourist junks, and beyond them the Lego-coloured blocks and cranes of the huge container port with dozens of supertankers queueing in the straits outside, and tier after tier of hazy Indonesian islands receding into the blue distance. </p> <p>Moreover, I could see all this from my bath on the twenty-sixth floor of the Ritz-Carlton Hotel. The Ritz-Carlton, Singapore, is one of the wonders of the modern world - I mean why struggle to admire ninth century Khmer civilisation when twenty-first century civilisation is so patently superior? I had a Millennia suite - a snip at \u00a3607 a night - the size of a small sheep farm, where the bath was set against a huge octagonal window so I could soak in bubbles surrounded by candles while looking over most of Singapore and a considerable chunk of Indonesia. The hotel has a new gimmick in the shape of a 'bath butler' who comes to run - sorry, 'draw' - your bath for you after consultation about the 'bath menu' - would 'Modom' like the cream bath or the traditional bubble bath or the detoxifying salt bath, etc. Luckily I was able to run my own bath and spent many happy hours in it, fantasising that I was Rupert Murdoch and shouting 'Buy!

You can hardly even get CNN.) </p> <p>Anyone determined to find history can find little bits of it in Singapore - the inevitable colonial quarter centring on Raffles hotel, Chinatown and Little India and the Arab quarter, all startlingly clean and tidy. But much more fun are the shopping malls, which are mostly underground - you see an escalator going down, hop on, and suddenly you are in the Chanel, Gucci, Prada, Versace mines that run for miles under Singapore and supposedly offer huge bargains. Best of all, you are never more than a few metres from great food - all the streets and shopping malls are dotted with delicious noodle bars, sushi, satay, samosa stalls, so that you can shop and snack, shop and snack, spend the whole day grazing, then end with a wonderful foot massage before tottering back to the Ritz-Carlton. </p> <p>So what did I learn about Indochina? Well, not much as you can see, but it was tremendous fun. Next year: Australia in a weekend.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Florida fly-drive prices as low as \u00a3199 could be on the way back as we head for the summer and British travellers can look forward to a bargain bonanza on US flights in general. Transatlantic scheduled airlines are becoming nervous about thousands of empty seats left unsold for May, June and even into July as the Americans stay away from Britain because of the foot and mouth crisis. Fares such as \u00a3299 return to Orlando for June are already emerging, down by\u00a350-\u00a3100 on the same flights this time last year, said Andrew Boyle at the Travelcare independent travel agency chain. He said it was likely prices would drop below \u00a3200, both for scheduled flight-only and for flight plus car-hire, before the spring was out. 'In previous years when there is too much capacity at this time, the airlines panic quite far in advance. This year they are trying to hold their nerve as they go into June, but they are starting to get jittery,' he said. The mass market holiday brands such as Thomson and Airtours use their own charter airlines which are tailored to the the UK market and so are less likely to be affected - unless they are drawn into a price war. But smaller operators who book holidaymakers on to scheduled flights with British Airways, Virgin Atlantic and some of the US carriers, are likely to start offering discounted fly-drives and all-in packages in the next few weeks. High street and internet agents, bucket shops, Teletext and the airlines themselves are also likely to start marketing cheap flight-only tickets. There is also likely to be a booking lull out of the UK in the run-up to the expected general election in early June. Bookings are likely to pick up in the few weeks immediately after the election, industry observers said. It is not just Florida where bargain hunters are likely to strike gold, although that is where most of the spare capacity is currently flying. Michael East, of travel consultancy Eastcastle, said scheduled airlines are likely to start discounting to cities such as New York, Boston, Chicago and San Francisco. 'If there are significant price cuts to the US it will draw in people from the UK who will switch from short-haul to long-haul,' he said.",

      "body": "<p>It was last year's Nokia TV ad that clinched it. That lithe, tanned, laughing couple tumbling and cartwheeling in a flurry of white linen and whiter teeth, sunshine twinkling poetically on the sea behind them, officially sealed the transition of a Brazilian martial art/dance/game from underground sport to big bucks, corporate eye-candy. Capoeira, you've come a long way, baby. </p> <p>A dazzlingly energetic, non-contact mix of jumps, kicks, spins and artful dodges, capoeira's exact origins aren't clear - some say it was born in Brazil, others that it was transplanted there from Angola - but this martial art grew up in the country's Bahia region among Africans taken into slavery by Portuguese traders, around 400 years ago. </p> <p>With any form of combat training among black slaves strictly forbidden by the Portuguese authorities, capoeira evolved, disguising fighting moves in an acrobatic competitive dance performed to music, which kept slaves strong, and rebellion at least a possibility. Still illegal - and punishable with the amputation of an arm or leg - as recently as the Twenties, capoeira found a new direction in the decades that followed as a form of artistic expression, not to mention an exciting and demanding form of exercise. </p> <p>Human traffic has taken the game global - Brazilian emigrants have set up capoeira schools all over the world. Capoeira gained a worldwide media profile in the Eighties, when American street dancers cited the game as a major influence on breaking, and now capoeira is played on New York club dance floors, taught at Eton and, of course, sells phones. </p> <p>Today a gaggle of travellers wearing the T-shirt of their chosen capoeira school are a daily sight on the streets of Bahia's capital, Salvador da Bahia de Todos os Santos. They come from all over the planet to train on the game's home turf. Airtours' introduction tomorrow of a direct nine-hour weekly flight to Salvador from the UK, cutting out the usual Rio de Janeiro or S\u00e3o Paulo detour, which turns the trip from long-haul into a thrombosis-friendly marathon, can only swell their numbers. </p> <p>Intrigued by capoeira for years, but with no experience, I made my own pilgrimage last October, armed with phone numbers for a few capoeira schools, a pair of gigantic white trousers and five words of Portuguese. The first few days of a seven-week trip to Brazil - spent on beaches and in bars in sophisticated Rio de Janeiro - did nothing to prepare me for the multisensory assault that is Salvador. This city, dogged though it is by unemployment, poverty and crime, is one sweaty, sexy, round-the-clock party. </p> <p>Salvador is a unique cultural collision. It is essentially an African community (the abolition of slavery in 1888 left tens of thousands of free citizens of African descent living in Salvador, and today they make up 80 per cent of the 2 million population) spliced into a once opulent colonial city built on a dramatic series of cliffs, bluffs and steep hills, and baked for four centuries in the steamy Latin heat. The rich smells of shrimp and palm oil hang in the air - testament to the African cookery traditions central to the Bahian diet. The streets bustle with people and there's no escaping the local styles of music pouring from open-air clubs, public stages, ghetto blasters and street musicians. </p> <p>And capoeira is everywhere. Circles of capoeiristas gather in the public spaces in front of poetically crumbling baroque churches, clapping, singing and playing esoteric musical instruments, while players cartwheel into the roda (circle of seated players) in pairs to play their best moves off each other. People practise all day long, backflipping on the palm-lined beaches, even sparring in the street, and everyone you meet seems to play at least a little. </p> <p>In fact, as a gringo novice, the only difficulty in getting some capoeira action is the massive range of available options. Which style: Angolan (graceful, slow, low to the ground) or Regional (all-leaping, all-whirling acrobatic variety)? Which school? And how to deal with the nerve-wracking machismo of the many teachers and touts who assure you, punching their fists into their palms, 'My school is the best. The hardest. You join, yes?' </p> <p>Eventually finding some teachers more sympathetic to the needs of a 33-year-old (Bahian capoeiristas start training as kids, even toddlers) looking to ease himself gently into the game, I turned up for my first Capoeira Regional class, at the Associac\u00e3o de Capoeira Mestre Bimba in Pelhourinho. Being white, the oldest student by 10 years and rather taller than your average Brazilian, my lack of skill and agility was conspicuous, but even though everyone's play often had to be slowed down to accommodate me, my classmates' tolerance and support were clear.

      "bodyText": "It was last year's Nokia TV ad that clinched it. That lithe, tanned, laughing couple tumbling and cartwheeling in a flurry of white linen and whiter teeth, sunshine twinkling poetically on the sea behind them, officially sealed the transition of a Brazilian martial art/dance/game from underground sport to big bucks, corporate eye-candy. Capoeira, you've come a long way, baby. A dazzlingly energetic, non-contact mix of jumps, kicks, spins and artful dodges, capoeira's exact origins aren't clear - some say it was born in Brazil, others that it was transplanted there from Angola - but this martial art grew up in the country's Bahia region among Africans taken into slavery by Portuguese traders, around 400 years ago. With any form of combat training among black slaves strictly forbidden by the Portuguese authorities, capoeira evolved, disguising fighting moves in an acrobatic competitive dance performed to music, which kept slaves strong, and rebellion at least a possibility. Still illegal - and punishable with the amputation of an arm or leg - as recently as the Twenties, capoeira found a new direction in the decades that followed as a form of artistic expression, not to mention an exciting and demanding form of exercise. Human traffic has taken the game global - Brazilian emigrants have set up capoeira schools all over the world. Capoeira gained a worldwide media profile in the Eighties, when American street dancers cited the game as a major influence on breaking, and now capoeira is played on New York club dance floors, taught at Eton and, of course, sells phones. Today a gaggle of travellers wearing the T-shirt of their chosen capoeira school are a daily sight on the streets of Bahia's capital, Salvador da Bahia de Todos os Santos. They come from all over the planet to train on the game's home turf. Airtours' introduction tomorrow of a direct nine-hour weekly flight to Salvador from the UK, cutting out the usual Rio de Janeiro or S\u00e3o Paulo detour, which turns the trip from long-haul into a thrombosis-friendly marathon, can only swell their numbers. Intrigued by capoeira for years, but with no experience, I made my own pilgrimage last October, armed with phone numbers for a few capoeira schools, a pair of gigantic white trousers and five words of Portuguese. The first few days of a seven-week trip to Brazil - spent on beaches and in bars in sophisticated Rio de Janeiro - did nothing to prepare me for the multisensory assault that is Salvador. This city, dogged though it is by unemployment, poverty and crime, is one sweaty, sexy, round-the-clock party. Salvador is a unique cultural collision. It is essentially an African community (the abolition of slavery in 1888 left tens of thousands of free citizens of African descent living in Salvador, and today they make up 80 per cent of the 2 million population) spliced into a once opulent colonial city built on a dramatic series of cliffs, bluffs and steep hills, and baked for four centuries in the steamy Latin heat. The rich smells of shrimp and palm oil hang in the air - testament to the African cookery traditions central to the Bahian diet. The streets bustle with people and there's no escaping the local styles of music pouring from open-air clubs, public stages, ghetto blasters and street musicians. And capoeira is everywhere. Circles of capoeiristas gather in the public spaces in front of poetically crumbling baroque churches, clapping, singing and playing esoteric musical instruments, while players cartwheel into the roda (circle of seated players) in pairs to play their best moves off each other. People practise all day long, backflipping on the palm-lined beaches, even sparring in the street, and everyone you meet seems to play at least a little. In fact, as a gringo novice, the only difficulty in getting some capoeira action is the massive range of available options. Which style: Angolan (graceful, slow, low to the ground) or Regional (all-leaping, all-whirling acrobatic variety)? Which school? And how to deal with the nerve-wracking machismo of the many teachers and touts who assure you, punching their fists into their palms, 'My school is the best. The hardest. You join, yes?' Eventually finding some teachers more sympathetic to the needs of a 33-year-old (Bahian capoeiristas start training as kids, even toddlers) looking to ease himself gently into the game, I turned up for my first Capoeira Regional class, at the Associac\u00e3o de Capoeira Mestre Bimba in Pelhourinho. Being white, the oldest student by 10 years and rather taller than your average Brazilian, my lack of skill and agility was conspicuous, but even though everyone's play often had to be slowed down to accommodate me, my classmates' tolerance and support were clear. So too was their loud amusement when, within minutes of starting my capoeira career, I slipped in my own sweat and crashed to the ground. The scariest moment was having to play in my first roda - learners have to get in the ring with everyone else from day one - to which challenge I responded by freezing to the spot for two agonisingly long minutes. Keen to stop being the crappiest capoeirista in town I also signed up with the excellent SSA school for 10 exhausting, exhilarating classes a week. I soon got into some kind of swing. Taking a lunchtime class at Mestre Nenel at Bimba's in Pelhourinho, I'd then ride a bus down to Barra to relax on the jammed, jumping beach before the evening session with SSA's Professore Zezo.

Proper rodas, where the whole session is spent playing in a circle, came around once a week, and while I took a long time to feel comfortable flailing and lunging under such scrutiny, the skills and speed of the more experienced players was never anything but top-quality entertainment.

      "bodyText": "Huddersfield's six-year stay in the First Division ended in tears, recrimination and disbelief as they lost a determined fight for survival amid ugly scenes at the McAlpine Stadium. Twelve months ago Town were edged out of a play-off place on the final day but the expression on the face of a devastated Lou Macari showed it was a very different finale yesterday. The manager had orchestrated a dramatic comeback, losing just six matches out of 26 League games, after the club were eight points behind second bottom Stockport in November to take them clear of the bottom three and he clearly had difficulty coming to terms with yesterday's turn of events. The Scot was subdued and found difficulty expressing his feelings but that could not be said about furious Huddersfield fans who reacted with anger to the prospect of Second Division football again after being promised so much in the past two years. Hundreds demonstrated outside the ground where they turned angrily on chairman Barry Rubery and police had to move in to rescue the millionaire as he attempted to leave the stadium after the game. Rubery tried to talk to the fans but when they closed in, and objects started to be thrown, police quickly escorted him back into the stadium and closed off the front of the building. Rubery represented a bright new future when he bought the club for \u00a315m but his misplaced optimism was evident again in his programme notes as he assured fans the club would be aiming for the First Division play-offs next season, signing off with 'I look forward to seeing you all back here in August in Division One'. Quite a few of them will not be back for Division Two after demanding Rubery's resignation and then chanting the name of Marcus Stewart, the striker controversially sold last season when the team were in a play-off position. The \u00a32.5m departure of their idol to Ipswich infuriated fans who claimed the club's decline, and their antipathy towards Rubery, can be traced back to that time. But he insisted after the game he would not be resigning and added: \"I take full responsibility for this.\" Certainly, the near 20,000 crowd did not attach any blame to Macari, who must have been close to breaking his teetotal rule for the first time. The way his players squandered chances, quite apart from throwing away the points by poor defending, was enough to drive the strongest manager to drink. \"We had a mountain to climb this season and we nearly got to the top but when we needed it to happen today, it didn't,\" he said. \"But it's not just today, it's what happened earlier in the season. \"It's been a long, hard slog and the slog ended like this. The players have done well and fought well for months and it's come to such a sad end. There is absolute silence in the dressing room and a few tears, everybody is just so very disappointed at what's happened. \"It's difficult to know what to say after we got ourselves out of the bottom three. It was down to what we did today and we did not do it. \"The last six months of effort has been fantastic from everyone. Unfortunately it's come down to this today when we've failed to get what we needed.\" Ironically, they were condemned by a Yorkshireman, Curtis Woodhouse, who moved to City from Sheffield United for \u00a31m this season and came up with his first goals for the club yesterday. Woodhouse struck in the 21st minute with Town's Andy Booth equalising in the final seconds of first-half normal time before the City midfielder pounced again just two minutes later. His goals mean City now face Preston in the play-off semi-finals with the first leg at St Andrews. They were already assured of a play-off place but manager Trevor Francis was coldly professional in his summary of the game. Asked if he had sympathy for Huddersfield Francis replied: \"No. We came here looking to win, we wanted to finish fourth and have the second leg at St Andrews under floodlights. \"That hasn't happened but we have gone five games unbeaten. There was plenty of incentive for us to come here and try to win.

Booth equalised, bundling in a dangerous cross from Ben Thornley but Town were stunned when Woodhouse stole in at the back post unmarked to head in an Andy Johnson cross. Town missed three chances in 11 first-half minutes with Thornley's drive deflected against a post by Darren Purse in the 29th minute and Simon Baldry missing from close in after a Thornley cross a minute later. But Booth should have buried his header in the 40th minute after a perfect cross from Craig Armstrong. Instead, the big striker hit a post.

      "body": "<p>For twenty-four hours I found it hard to shake off a sense of unreality. Arriving in Edinburgh to be greeted by bright sunshine was unsettling enough, but wandering around the old offices of the Scotsman, now a five-star hotel, was downright weird. </p> <p>There was nothing five-star about the old building when I was there: purpose built at the start of the last century as a newspaper office, it was a phenomenon of its time. It sprawled over nine different levels, a one-stop newspaper production plant that opened straight on to the sidings at Waverley station. </p> <p>It was a seamless production process, from scribbling, to hot metal, to bundles of newspapers on a train heading for far-flung parts of Scotland. Or at least the outer edges of the Lothians. </p> <p>By the time I arrived as editor in May 1998, the idea of the building being purpose built for newspapers was risible. The lower levels, where the presses used to be, were dark cavernous spaces, filled with the detritus of years of newspaper production. It was a place you hurried through on your way to the car park and where, inevitably, you got lost. </p> <p>The Scotsman operated from the third floor, with its departments scattered in a variety of cubby-holes and dark offices. The editor's suite was wonderfully grand, with oak-panelled walls and imposing portraits of former editors. In stark contrast, the newsroom was a dreadful place lit by mind-altering yellow uplights and was horribly overcrowded. The rest of the building, with the notable exception of the senior executives' suite, was a rabbit warren of offices spread haphazardly across the various floors. </p> <p>What was ideal in the early 1900s had become unmanageable by the end of the century: there was a real sense of relief when we finally moved out in October 1999 to the sleek modernism of a new building down by the site of Scotland's new Parliament. </p> <p>Quite how anybody could look at that building and see a five-star hotel was something none of us could understand at the time. The man who did was Jonathan Wix, who had already created the highly regarded 42 The Calls in Leeds. Eighteen months and \u00a319.5 million later, he has got his five-star hotel. </p> <p>Or very nearly. Although open for business, the hotel is far from finished. Builders hammer away as they rush to finish restaurants, a leisure centre complete with stainless steel swimming pool, a night club and several conference areas. Of the 68 bedrooms and suites, about 40 are ready for guests, with the rest due on stream within weeks. The ultimate deadline has to be the series of festivals that take over Edinburgh for most of August. </p> <p>Soon after I arrived last Monday I started to poke around, trying to work out what had gone where. The newsroom, mercifully, is no more. In its place is a collection of bedrooms: people will now pay - rather than be paid - to sleep there. The old features department is, suitably, a bar, its wall lined with back-lit bottles of malt whiskies - it claims to have 399 in stock and on display. </p> <p>My old office is a bedroom, and quite an impressive one at that. It was always an imposing room, with a sweeping view of the New Town through its three-cornered windows. It was a strange feeling, standing in the middle of that room. It used to host smoky conferences enlivened by occasional spats. In my first month at the paper I had sat dutifully by the window and listened to the Chancellor's views on macro-economics and why Scottish nationalism was a busted flush; now, the office will host excitable tourists and dour financiers unaware of what went before. </p> <p>At least the original conductors' pledge, taken from the 1816 prospectus for the newspaper, is still there, looking somewhat incongruous now. Before we vacated the building I had tried, but failed, to prise it off the wall, but it wouldn't budge. I thought some loutish builder would hack it to pieces, but it has survived intact. </p> <p>The same cannot be said for the roll call of editors from 1817 onwards which used to be etched on the panelling opposite what is now the bar. They have been painted over, but Andrew Buchanan, the general manager, assures me that they will be reinstated. </p> <p>I was the last one on the wall, with my finish date left blank. A few months after moving to Holyrood, I had been turfed out by the paper's owners but I liked the idea that in the hotel, my editorship would seem timeless: 1998-infinity. Now it's just black paint, but I will come back to check whether Buchanan fulfils his pledge. </p> <p>Judging the hotel before it is fully open, and before it has had a chance to settle down, would be harsh. It has the potential to be stunning, and to be by far the best hotel in Scotland's capital, but there is still a long way to go to fulfil that potential. </p> <p>In its favour is a collection of bedrooms and suites that are individual and generally spacious: no two are the same and the peculiar contours of the building throw up some great nooks. In some rooms, roll-topped baths sit in turret spaces with spectacular views over the city. </p> <p>A magnificent split-level penthouse, complete with sauna and a balcony with a barbecue and breathtaking roof-top views, will set you back \u00a3800 a night; a more modest double room \u00a3149, with options in between. All come with widescreen TV, DVD players and a remote keyboard that allows you to get on the internet. </p> <p>Despite its five-star aspirations, the Scotsman has steered clear of five-star rip-offs. You will pay a fair whack for your room, but they won't insult you by charging \u00a32 for a mini-bar Mars bar. The rooms are stocked with decent wines at normal bar prices, and snacks at shop prices. Similarly, the bar and restaurant prices are reasonable: a superb eggs benedict for breakfast is just \u00a35, a bar bill for four drinks just \u00a311: not what you'd expect in a normal five star. </p> <p>The star attractions - fine dining room, the brasserie and bar in the dramatic old entrance hall and the leisure centre - will be ready in a couple of months and if the standards match what is already on offer in microcosm, the Scotsman won't struggle to fill its rooms. </p> <p>People will quibble with some of the design and some of the colour schemes - there is a prepon derance of black and a lot of tartan - and some bizarre lights, but mostly it works. </p> <p>Perhaps my approval is coloured by what went before: I know what it was like, and what has been achieved is remarkable. Those without a sense of the place's history will just judge it against the Balmoral or the Caledonian and worry about value for money. I suspect they'll get it. </p> <p>The final element in the Scotsman's development will be the night club. Since a few of the rooms are already named after former editors, some wags have suggested it should be named after the paper's current publisher Andrew Neil, a Tramp habitu\u00e9, and the man who dispatched me. But he will be disappointed: the hotel wants the night club pitched at the mature end of the market. </p> <p> The Scotsman Hotel (0131 556 5565, <a href=\"http://www.scotsmanhotel.co.uk\">www.scotsmanhotel.co.uk</a>) has a special introductory weekend break rate of \u00a390 till 30 June (for two sharing, including breakfast). Thereafter, double room prices start at \u00a3149 </p> <p><strong>Hot off the press</strong><br></p> <p>Here are a few other luxury hotels that were once media haunts: </p> <p>London's <strong> Langham Hilton</strong> (020 763 1000) was converted from BBC offices, canteen and studios before opening in 1991. The Palm Court tearoom was a recording studio for Radio 3.

It opened as a hotel in 1998. From \u00a3275 a night. </p> <p><strong> Le Faubourg Sofitel Demeure Hotel</strong> in Paris (020 8283 4570) housed the offices of the Marie Claire magazine group before opening as a hotel in 1999. From Ff1,850 (\u00a3185) a room. </p> <p><strong> The Hotel Bel-Ami</strong> in Paris (Design Hotels 0800 169 8817) is in a building occupied by the National Printers in the eighteenth century. From \u00a3175 a night. </p> <p><strong> The Hotel Lindrum</strong> in Melbourne, Australia (Design Hotels 0800 169 8817) was once home to the Herald paper. From \u00a392 a night.</p>",

There was nothing five-star about the old building when I was there: purpose built at the start of the last century as a newspaper office, it was a phenomenon of its time. It sprawled over nine different levels, a one-stop newspaper production plant that opened straight on to the sidings at Waverley station. It was a seamless production process, from scribbling, to hot metal, to bundles of newspapers on a train heading for far-flung parts of Scotland. Or at least the outer edges of the Lothians. By the time I arrived as editor in May 1998, the idea of the building being purpose built for newspapers was risible. The lower levels, where the presses used to be, were dark cavernous spaces, filled with the detritus of years of newspaper production. It was a place you hurried through on your way to the car park and where, inevitably, you got lost. The Scotsman operated from the third floor, with its departments scattered in a variety of cubby-holes and dark offices. The editor's suite was wonderfully grand, with oak-panelled walls and imposing portraits of former editors. In stark contrast, the newsroom was a dreadful place lit by mind-altering yellow uplights and was horribly overcrowded. The rest of the building, with the notable exception of the senior executives' suite, was a rabbit warren of offices spread haphazardly across the various floors. What was ideal in the early 1900s had become unmanageable by the end of the century: there was a real sense of relief when we finally moved out in October 1999 to the sleek modernism of a new building down by the site of Scotland's new Parliament. Quite how anybody could look at that building and see a five-star hotel was something none of us could understand at the time. The man who did was Jonathan Wix, who had already created the highly regarded 42 The Calls in Leeds. Eighteen months and \u00a319.5 million later, he has got his five-star hotel. Or very nearly. Although open for business, the hotel is far from finished. Builders hammer away as they rush to finish restaurants, a leisure centre complete with stainless steel swimming pool, a night club and several conference areas. Of the 68 bedrooms and suites, about 40 are ready for guests, with the rest due on stream within weeks. The ultimate deadline has to be the series of festivals that take over Edinburgh for most of August. Soon after I arrived last Monday I started to poke around, trying to work out what had gone where. The newsroom, mercifully, is no more. In its place is a collection of bedrooms: people will now pay - rather than be paid - to sleep there. The old features department is, suitably, a bar, its wall lined with back-lit bottles of malt whiskies - it claims to have 399 in stock and on display. My old office is a bedroom, and quite an impressive one at that. It was always an imposing room, with a sweeping view of the New Town through its three-cornered windows. It was a strange feeling, standing in the middle of that room. It used to host smoky conferences enlivened by occasional spats. In my first month at the paper I had sat dutifully by the window and listened to the Chancellor's views on macro-economics and why Scottish nationalism was a busted flush; now, the office will host excitable tourists and dour financiers unaware of what went before. At least the original conductors' pledge, taken from the 1816 prospectus for the newspaper, is still there, looking somewhat incongruous now. Before we vacated the building I had tried, but failed, to prise it off the wall, but it wouldn't budge. I thought some loutish builder would hack it to pieces, but it has survived intact. The same cannot be said for the roll call of editors from 1817 onwards which used to be etched on the panelling opposite what is now the bar. They have been painted over, but Andrew Buchanan, the general manager, assures me that they will be reinstated. I was the last one on the wall, with my finish date left blank. A few months after moving to Holyrood, I had been turfed out by the paper's owners but I liked the idea that in the hotel, my editorship would seem timeless: 1998-infinity. Now it's just black paint, but I will come back to check whether Buchanan fulfils his pledge. Judging the hotel before it is fully open, and before it has had a chance to settle down, would be harsh. It has the potential to be stunning, and to be by far the best hotel in Scotland's capital, but there is still a long way to go to fulfil that potential. In its favour is a collection of bedrooms and suites that are individual and generally spacious: no two are the same and the peculiar contours of the building throw up some great nooks. In some rooms, roll-topped baths sit in turret spaces with spectacular views over the city. A magnificent split-level penthouse, complete with sauna and a balcony with a barbecue and breathtaking roof-top views, will set you back \u00a3800 a night; a more modest double room \u00a3149, with options in between. All come with widescreen TV, DVD players and a remote keyboard that allows you to get on the internet. Despite its five-star aspirations, the Scotsman has steered clear of five-star rip-offs. You will pay a fair whack for your room, but they won't insult you by charging \u00a32 for a mini-bar Mars bar. The rooms are stocked with decent wines at normal bar prices, and snacks at shop prices. Similarly, the bar and restaurant prices are reasonable: a superb eggs benedict for breakfast is just \u00a35, a bar bill for four drinks just \u00a311: not what you'd expect in a normal five star. The star attractions - fine dining room, the brasserie and bar in the dramatic old entrance hall and the leisure centre - will be ready in a couple of months and if the standards match what is already on offer in microcosm, the Scotsman won't struggle to fill its rooms. People will quibble with some of the design and some of the colour schemes - there is a prepon derance of black and a lot of tartan - and some bizarre lights, but mostly it works. Perhaps my approval is coloured by what went before: I know what it was like, and what has been achieved is remarkable. Those without a sense of the place's history will just judge it against the Balmoral or the Caledonian and worry about value for money. I suspect they'll get it. The final element in the Scotsman's development will be the night club. Since a few of the rooms are already named after former editors, some wags have suggested it should be named after the paper's current publisher Andrew Neil, a Tramp habitu\u00e9, and the man who dispatched me. But he will be disappointed: the hotel wants the night club pitched at the mature end of the market. The Scotsman Hotel (0131 556 5565, www.scotsmanhotel.co.uk) has a special introductory weekend break rate of \u00a390 till 30 June (for two sharing, including breakfast). Thereafter, double room prices start at \u00a3149 Hot off the press Here are a few other luxury hotels that were once media haunts: London's Langham Hilton (020 763 1000) was converted from BBC offices, canteen and studios before opening in 1991. The Palm Court tearoom was a recording studio for Radio 3. From \u00a3295 a night. One Aldwych in London (The Leading Small Hotels of the World 0800 181123) was built in 1907 to house the Morning Post newspaper for 30 years. It opened as a hotel in 1998. From \u00a3275 a night. Le Faubourg Sofitel Demeure Hotel in Paris (020 8283 4570) housed the offices of the Marie Claire magazine group before opening as a hotel in 1999. From Ff1,850 (\u00a3185) a room. The Hotel Bel-Ami in Paris (Design Hotels 0800 169 8817) is in a building occupied by the National Printers in the eighteenth century. From \u00a3175 a night. The Hotel Lindrum in Melbourne, Australia (Design Hotels 0800 169 8817) was once home to the Herald paper. From \u00a392 a night.",

The following is that letter which shows the build-up of anger that McVeigh had against a US federal government 'run amok' against its citizens and the politics that led to his bombing of the Alfred P Murrah building in Oklahoma City on April 19 1995 - the second anniversary of Waco.

      "body": "<p>Preston won the phoney war ahead of the real battle in the forthcoming play-offs, but they will be wary of meeting West Brom in the final in Cardiff after being outplayed by Gary Megson's team.</p> <p>Graham Alexander's penalty won the game for David Moyes's team to secure a two-legged semi-final against Birmingham City. Albion now face third-placed Bolton.</p> <p>With both clubs already assured of a place in the play-offs before the game, there was little to play for other than the honour of finishing fourth, fifth or sixth.</p> <p>Perhaps the absence of any pressure contributed to the whirlwind start to the game made by both teams. Two clear chances were spurned before Sean Gregan broke the deadlock for Preston after less than 90 seconds.</p> <p>The Albion midfielder Adam Chambers could have scored within the first 20 seconds after being released by Jason Roberts, but Preston goalkeeper David Lucas twice saved well from the youngster.</p> <p>Preston responded immediately and Chambers showed great stamina by racing back to his own penalty box to block Richard Cresswell's shot from 12 yards.</p> <p>From the resultant corner, however, Gregan opened the scoring when he converted Alexander's cross with a toe poke from close range. Perhaps the game did mean something after all.</p> <p>A year ago, both Preston and West Brom would have gladly taken a place in the top six at this stage of the season. North End had just lifted the Second Division championship, while Albion were breathing a huge sigh of relief having narrowly avoided relegation.</p> <p>Neither team wanted to show their hand ahead of the play-offs, however, and it was no surprise that both line-ups bore little resemblance to the teams that have taken Preston and West Brom into their lofty positions this season. Albion were without five regulars, while Preston were missing six of their best.</p> <p>At least Preston acknowledged the fact that something needed to be done to spice up the atmosphere inside Deepdale to avoid the game resembling a pre-season testimonial.

      "bodyText": "Preston won the phoney war ahead of the real battle in the forthcoming play-offs, but they will be wary of meeting West Brom in the final in Cardiff after being outplayed by Gary Megson's team. Graham Alexander's penalty won the game for David Moyes's team to secure a two-legged semi-final against Birmingham City. Albion now face third-placed Bolton. With both clubs already assured of a place in the play-offs before the game, there was little to play for other than the honour of finishing fourth, fifth or sixth. Perhaps the absence of any pressure contributed to the whirlwind start to the game made by both teams. Two clear chances were spurned before Sean Gregan broke the deadlock for Preston after less than 90 seconds. The Albion midfielder Adam Chambers could have scored within the first 20 seconds after being released by Jason Roberts, but Preston goalkeeper David Lucas twice saved well from the youngster. Preston responded immediately and Chambers showed great stamina by racing back to his own penalty box to block Richard Cresswell's shot from 12 yards. From the resultant corner, however, Gregan opened the scoring when he converted Alexander's cross with a toe poke from close range. Perhaps the game did mean something after all. A year ago, both Preston and West Brom would have gladly taken a place in the top six at this stage of the season. North End had just lifted the Second Division championship, while Albion were breathing a huge sigh of relief having narrowly avoided relegation. Neither team wanted to show their hand ahead of the play-offs, however, and it was no surprise that both line-ups bore little resemblance to the teams that have taken Preston and West Brom into their lofty positions this season. Albion were without five regulars, while Preston were missing six of their best. At least Preston acknowledged the fact that something needed to be done to spice up the atmosphere inside Deepdale to avoid the game resembling a pre-season testimonial. The imaginative North End PR Department had decided to make this game 'David Moyes Day' as a tribute to the young Scottish manager who has resurrected the club since succeeding Gary Peters three years ago. Supporters were urged to dress in kilts and don ginger wigs in order to look like Moyes, while the club provided a piper for entertainment. Amazingly, hundreds of Preston loyalists answered the call and Deepdale could have been Hampden Park had the home side not been kitted out in white shirts. West Brom seemed to benefit from the party atmosphere more than Preston, however. Despite falling behind to Gregan's goal, Gary Megson's team created the better chances and deservedly levelled through Neil Clement's free-kick. Referee David Laws forced the Preston wall back a further ten yards following their reluctance to retreat the proper distance and Clement took advantage to float his 25-yard effort past Lucas. The home supporters were incensed by the decision to force the wall back, but they were cheering the referee shortly after the re-start following his decision to award a penalty after Jason Van Blerk had handled David Healy's cross. Graham Alexander has never missed a penalty for Preston and he maintained his 100 per cent record by beating goalkeeper Russell Hoult. His goal gave Preston their first victory over one of their play-off rivals this season. Three more wins and they will be in the Premiership. West Brom manager Gary Megson said: \"You never set out to lose a game and I think we both wanted to win, but there are other things to take into consideration. \"I tried to use the game as preparation for next week's play-off semi-final and that's why I took Neil Clement off.

The funds raised will be used in Unicef-sponsored projects in countries like Afghanistan, Sierra Leone and Angola - where children have been made homeless or maimed as a direct result of violence. Later this month Unicef will publish a report showing that two million children have been killed in conflicts across the world over the past decade. The study also reveals that because of regional fighting in countries like Afghanistan and Sierra Leone, 'for children, the world is now a more violent and volatile place than at any time since the Second World War'. The report examines how children are forced to fend for themselves as they experience homelessness, displacement and the loss of family members. \u0095 Two million children have been killed by conflict over the last 10 years; 12 million children have been made homeless; six million children have been injured or disabled. \u0095 Of the world's 40 million displaced, 20 million are children. Up to 10,000 children each year are killed by landmines. \u0095 At least 300,000 children, at any given time, are actively involved in armed conflict. \u0095 500 million small arms and light weapons are in circulation. \u0095 In the conflict in Sierra Leone, 30 per cent of some warring factions are thought to be children.

Patricia Yates, editor of Holiday Which? says consumers are in for a confusing time because high street travel agents are currently stocking brochures for three seasons: summer 2001, the forthcoming winter and summer 2002. 'It's a mess,' she says. </p> <p>The biggest mass market tour operators - Thomson, Airtours, First Choice and JMC - have dreamed up all sorts of gimmicks to persuade consumers that they really should hurry to bag their package holiday some 15 months before they step on the plane. </p> <p>Two thirds of the 10 million people who take summer packages book no more than eight months before their holiday and many like to wait until the last minute in the hope of a price war. So as the hype for next summer cranks up, the question for bargain hunters is - when is the best time to book? </p> <p>Amanda Williams, head of sales at the largest independent travel agent Travelcare, part of the Co-op group, told us: 'There are many advantages of booking early, particularly if you have set dates when you want to go away, you are looking for free child places, a particular property and the best early family deals.' </p> <p>But leaving a booking until the autumn or early next year does not mean that the choice of flights and accommodation will be poor, just not as good. </p> <p>Williams says that average package prices have risen by no more than inflation over the past two years. Short-haul packages average around \u00a3400 per person for a week and\u00a3800 long-haul. </p> <p>'My advice is to forget the discounts, which in some cases are misleading, and look at the price you will actually pay. Decide where you want to go, for the best price and widest choice in your chosen destination. You will still get a good deal for 2002 if you book this autumn or next January.' </p> <p>Even booking the same hotel for the same dates can produce very different prices depending on operator and airline. Not surprisingly, Williams recommends you get your independent travel agent to do the work, comparing prices between brochures and in the computer reservations systems and, in larger branches, even surfing the internet, Teletext and digital television holiday channels for you in the shop. </p> <p>Many independent operators, such as Greek specialist Kosmar, have already put together an early version of their summer 2002 programmes and put the prices in agents' reservations systems - with packages that are very competitive with the mass market. Williams advises that you ask your agent to look for such deals, because they may not be offered without prompting. </p> <p>And what of the early booking offers? Given that discounts on packages for this summer hit 70 per cent in the peak booking period in January, it is obvious that even half-price offers now in some 2002 brochures will not prove the best and final deals for the bulk of holidays. </p> <p>And some observers criticise early brochures because the bulk of flight times for all the charter airlines next summer will not be fixed until November. Booking especially early now to secure a civilised daytime flight does not guarantee you will not be switched to a night flight nearer the time. </p> <p>Noel Josephides, managing director of holiday company Sunvil and a spokesman for the Association of Independent Tour Operators, said: 'Early booking is being rammed down people's throats, but it is a lot of eyewash.

Thomson's lowest price for next summer is \u00a3179 per person based on four adults sharing a one-bedroom apartment in Majorca for a week in October.

Orwell's famous verdict illuminates every sentence of David Cannadine's impressively concise analysis of Britannia's perception of her wave-ruling exertions. Class is what concerns him, class in all its complex, Hydra-headed ferocity. </p> <p>Cannadine claims that Ornamentalism follows on from his Class in Britain, but, in another sense, it completes the analysis of the twentieth-century recession of British global influence he began with The Decline and Fall of the British Aristocracy (1992). Appropriately for a historian who has also written about P.G.

Orwell's famous verdict illuminates every sentence of David Cannadine's impressively concise analysis of Britannia's perception of her wave-ruling exertions. Class is what concerns him, class in all its complex, Hydra-headed ferocity. Cannadine claims that Ornamentalism follows on from his Class in Britain, but, in another sense, it completes the analysis of the twentieth-century recession of British global influence he began with The Decline and Fall of the British Aristocracy (1992). Appropriately for a historian who has also written about P.G. Wodehouse, it memorialises a lost world of aristocratic fantasy. As well as watching the Union Jack fluttering down, and sounding the 'Last Post' over a lifetime of distinguished scholarship, Ornamentalism offers a spirited riposte to, and critique of, Edward Said's celebrated Orientalism.

      "body": "<p><strong> Bill Viola </strong> Anthony d'Offay, London W1, until 21 July </p> <p> The most powerful show by a living artist to be seen in Britain today is at the Anthony d'Offay Gallery in London: 13 new works by the American <strong> Bill Viola</strong>, presented in near-total darkness. It is not given to many artists to be both dazzling and deep, least of all in the medium of video. But for the last quarter century, Viola has been using the newest technology to stir the oldest of emotions. Simply to describe his work as profound would be to neglect its startlingly inventive beauty. </p> <p>At 50, Viola has become the Rembrandt of the video age, an artist who has done more than any of his contemporaries to advance the emotional and aesthetic content of his medium. Analogies with painting prove strangely significant in Viola's latest work. The first piece in this show, for example, takes the form of a hi-tech diptych: instead of hinged frames, two Panasonic televisions; instead of wooden panels, a pair of plasma screens. </p> <p>What you see may be secular and modern - a couple having a row - but it connects back to ancient traditions of religious painting. Gradually, almost imperceptibly, the little local difficulty in this video escalates into a timeless Passion. </p> <p>A man and a woman, in their separate frames, are locked in elemental anguish. As the film begins - silent, and in ultra-slow motion - it seems as though the man is launching some terrible accusation, arms spreading, mouth gaping, head flung down and back in cataclysmic outrage. She turns away, covers her ears, shudders with grief. Perhaps, you think, she is somehow to blame. But as the moments inch by, the movements stretch and swim into something less legible and far more ambiguous: are they in the same room; do they even hear each other; is he reacting to her accusations? </p> <p>Opposed and yet joined: the medieval form of the diptych gives this video its metaphor. But this is no particular Adam and Eve. The extreme, almost glacial slowness of the images seems to disembody the action, to eternalise the spasm of anguish. His film visualises emotion in its universal state, all of us turning on the spit of pain, deaf to each other's suffering. </p> <p>People wept to see this work on the day I visited the gallery, as if remembering their past. But the experience is also amazingly consoling, perhaps because of the beauty of these lifesize figures, shot in silver-grey, passing like astronauts or weightless divers through the ballet of their emotions. But also because the film releases you into a different future, one in which you have another chance not to cause - and thus be twinned in - misery. </p> <p>This gift is not something you regularly receive from contemporary theatre or cinema, still less from a West End gallery. It might be argued that Viola borrows something from each, employing performers and assistants to film his art. But he simulates nothing. His colleagues are on their own, impelled by no more than an initial word. Which is, I think, why everything he makes is inflected by a sense of wonder and immediate surprise. </p> <p>In the past, Viola has filmed mirages in the Sahara, shamen walking on red-hot coals, bison roaming the prairies. He was gripped by the renewing cycle of life, most literally in his film of the simultaneous birth of his son and passing of his mother in the great Nantes Triptych, now at Tate Modern. But Viola is not a narrative artist. His videos don't have a denouement, let alone a cinematic ending. They are phrased like music, pausing, proliferating, subsiding, only to begin again. </p> <p>The medium, in short, is not his message. Although he was among the pioneers of American video art in the early Seventies, Viola had nothing to say about the squeaking gogglebox of the television age any more than the postmodern media of digicam. His images are as purely pre-rational as the painted animals in the Lascaux caves. What video gives him is the dimension of time, which he uses to spellbinding effect. In his art, a shot of a droplet gradually welling - and reflecting the world around it - can be as enthralling as any action movie. </p> <p>One of the works in this show reverses the process by condensing a whole life in less than 15 minutes. Five tiny screens, about the size of a portable altarpiece, show the same women in the same room at different times of the day. The scale is renaissance and so is the scene: pale limewashed walls, bare wooden floor, a woman dressed in timeless clothes. She washes her face, takes up her sewing, writes a letter, lights candles and eventually retires to bed. </p> <p>It might be the life of a saint, complete with iconographic props - the stem of lilies, the Virgin's blue cloak, the halo of candlelight silhouetting her head. But the pleasures it commands - peace, absorption, domestic ritual - aren't merely religious. Nor is this an essay on renaissance painting alone. Van Eyck, Vermeer, Utamaro, Van Gogh: each glimmering screen takes you over the threshold into the interior world of painting. </p> <p> Catherine's Room is shot in real time. But the woman performs her tasks with such slow care that each screen, at any given moment, appears to be almost static. Through the window, the light shifts drowsily from morning blue to purple twilight, measuring her brief life in the sun. This is a masterpiece in miniature, compressing the richness of art, of religion, of contemplative philosophy into the short fraction of an hour. But more time is precisely what it grants in return for your attention, a pause for thought that extends far beyond the hour. </p> <p>Questioned about the unusual power of his videos, Viola tends to give diffident explanations - 'The medium gives a full-body experience that is not intellectual... the technology is so sensual that people can just take pleasure from the form.' This, of course, could be said of any home movie or MTV promo; it hardly comes close to the immense skill of his work. Even when all the techniques are revealed - speed, angle, lumens, resolution - nothing is lost or explained away. </p> <p>One can learn, for example, that the most affecting work in this show was made with the aid of a mirror and some water and yet none of its essential mystery is removed. Surrender is a modified diptych: one figure in a portrait-shaped screen above another, inverted, each engulfed in grief. Slowly they bow down, immersing themselves in the dark waters. Slowly they rise again, tears streaming from their eyes. </p> <p>The configuration changes. The movements swim and convulse. Gradually the images break into ripples, shattered in the tidal emotion. You might see it as a human tragedy - two people forever converging, never quite meeting, locked in their own isolated minds. Or you might see it as a spiritual transfiguration, the cycle of suffering and resurrection eternalised. Either way, its overwhelming vision releases an identical grief - and accompanying compassion - in the viewer. It is the single most cathartic work I have ever seen in a gallery.</p>",

      "body": "<p>London's South Bank isn't a full-blown fiasco on the scale of the great Wembley Stadium disaster. Not yet, anyway. It came pretty close a couple of years ago, but at the last moment, unlike the Football Association, its managers weren't daft enough to set about demolishing the Queen Elizabeth Hall and gutting the Hayward Gallery before they knew where the money to replace them was coming from. </p> <p>But over the last dozen years or so, they have managed to work their way through three entirely different masterplans for dealing with the wilderness around Britain's most important cultural complex and making good its architectural shortcomings, squandering millions in the process. </p> <p>When Rick Mather's scheme for an elevated park on top of a new home for the British Film Institute, a new concert hall and an array of shops and restaurants, each designed by different architects was unveiled last year, things looked more hopeful. There would be two so-called blade office blocks to pay for the project and Elliott Bernerd, the property-developer chairman of the South Bank Centre appointed by Tony Blair, tried to get things moving. But Bernerd has just returned to London after a period of illness only to find the whole intricate scheme threatening to unravel again over a clash between two competing architectural egos. </p> <p>In Bernerd's absence, the jury set up to choose an architect couldn't agree between Rafael Vinoly, the suave fifty-something veteran responsible for the giant Tokyo Forum and head of a 150-strong architectural practice based in New York, and Foreign Office Architects, which is run by two thirtysomethings whose biggest completed building so far is the Belgo restaurant in Notting Hill. Instead of making up their minds, the jury tried to appoint both. Could they not do the job together? the South Bank Centre asked. </p> <p>Vinoly makes bombastic buildings that try a bit too hard to impress, but he has got concert halls in New York and Philadelphia to his name. Foreign Office belongs to the school of Zaha Hadid and makes architecture that a decade ago would have been regarded as unbuildable but which is fast becoming fashionable. To expect the two to share the South Bank was like asking Julian Schnabel to prime canvas for Tracey Emin. </p> <p>The two teams did, however, agree to give it a try.

      "bodyText": "London's South Bank isn't a full-blown fiasco on the scale of the great Wembley Stadium disaster. Not yet, anyway. It came pretty close a couple of years ago, but at the last moment, unlike the Football Association, its managers weren't daft enough to set about demolishing the Queen Elizabeth Hall and gutting the Hayward Gallery before they knew where the money to replace them was coming from. But over the last dozen years or so, they have managed to work their way through three entirely different masterplans for dealing with the wilderness around Britain's most important cultural complex and making good its architectural shortcomings, squandering millions in the process. When Rick Mather's scheme for an elevated park on top of a new home for the British Film Institute, a new concert hall and an array of shops and restaurants, each designed by different architects was unveiled last year, things looked more hopeful. There would be two so-called blade office blocks to pay for the project and Elliott Bernerd, the property-developer chairman of the South Bank Centre appointed by Tony Blair, tried to get things moving. But Bernerd has just returned to London after a period of illness only to find the whole intricate scheme threatening to unravel again over a clash between two competing architectural egos. In Bernerd's absence, the jury set up to choose an architect couldn't agree between Rafael Vinoly, the suave fifty-something veteran responsible for the giant Tokyo Forum and head of a 150-strong architectural practice based in New York, and Foreign Office Architects, which is run by two thirtysomethings whose biggest completed building so far is the Belgo restaurant in Notting Hill. Instead of making up their minds, the jury tried to appoint both. Could they not do the job together? the South Bank Centre asked. Vinoly makes bombastic buildings that try a bit too hard to impress, but he has got concert halls in New York and Philadelphia to his name. Foreign Office belongs to the school of Zaha Hadid and makes architecture that a decade ago would have been regarded as unbuildable but which is fast becoming fashionable. To expect the two to share the South Bank was like asking Julian Schnabel to prime canvas for Tracey Emin. The two teams did, however, agree to give it a try. The attempt went wrong from the moment it was announced at the end of March, with both sides jockeying for position in the hope that they would end up either with the entire commission for themselves or, at least, manage to sideline their partner. Foreign Office's publicity machine went into immediate overdrive, presenting it as the conceptual brains of the scheme and casting Vinoly as a safe pair of hands charged with realising the vision of the two young stars. Vinoly was outraged and told everybody who would listen how angry he was by the suggestion that he was just a technician. 'There is an element of surrealism about the situation,' he says. 'We have never had the role of executive architects. To me, the jury's choice was a very puzzling decision. It's a very delicate situation, but we continue talking.' Alejandro Zaero-Polo, one half of Foreign Office, is more blunt: 'Vinoly's position was, \"I am the big guy, I make the decisions\". We said no, we are not going under Vinoly's umbrella.

To be creatures who love, we must be creatures who can despair at what we lose, and depression is the mechanism of that despair,' says Andrew Solomon at the start of his magnificent book. </p> <p>In his first sweeping sentences, he gathers up the themes and even the words that will resonate through the following pages of linked autobiography, history, science, analysis, wrenched and luminous meditation on life and pain. Love, loss and despair ring out their melancholy notes. In depression, he says over and over again, life loses its meaning; the 'only feeling left in this loveless state is insignificance'. </p> <p>Yet The Noonday Demon stands as a testament to all those qualities that are lost during times of deathly meaninglessness: it describes numbness with vitality, wretchedness with poetry, lovelessness with passion, fear with exuberance, slack-jawed horror with wit and tenderness, deadly silence with this fervent outpouring of words. Depression is a country that the undepressed can't enter, but Solomon, who has travelled there and knows it well, bends all his energy and talent as a writer to sending us snapshots from this terrifying land (mood, he writes, 'is a frontier like deep ocean or deep space'). The result is scary but far from dispiriting; at times, Solomon's voice, calling to us from beyond the frontier, achieves a lonely rapture. </p> <p>Solomon writes that depression can only be evoked by metaphors (the abyss, the edge, the darkness). The first that he uses himself is of a tree wrapped around by a vine; at some point, the vine squeezes the life out of the tree. Then he talks of angels and demons: grief is like a humble angel that leaves us with a clear sense of our own depth; depression is the (noonday) demon that leaves you appalled.</p> <p>Mild depression is gradual, like rust; it is too much grief at too slight a cause. Major depression is the stuff of breakdowns, not rust, but the startling collapse of the whole system. He has been gripped by major depression himself, when he was 'asphyxiated', 'split and racked', and 'every second of being alive hurt'. There was not even enough life left for tears, just 'the arid pain of total violation'. As you fall towards this living death, he says, the first thing that goes from you is happiness. The next is the sadness that led you here. Then your sense of humour, the belief in and capacity for love. You smell sour to your self, and thinned. Your face comes apart in the mirror. You have no ability to trust, to touch, to grieve: 'Eventually, you are simply absence.' </p> <p>There were many days when he couldn't move, couldn't swing his legs out of bed, couldn't control his bodily functions; he could only lie in a corner and weep. He wanted to die but didn't have the energy to kill himself. He did, however, pick up gay men whom he thought might be HIV positive and have sex with them, in the hope he, too, would become infected. Solomon is well aware of the 'preposterousness' of his depression and the uselessness of tracking its causes. </p> <p>He is a wealthy, white American, a privileged, healthy, admired writer, envied by many for his success, his wealth, his luck, his apparent gaiety and ease. He has many friends. He was reasonably happy as a child, although confused about his sexuality and sometimes gripped by panic. His first major breakdown occurred after the death of his beloved mother (an assisted suicide because of her terminal cancer. He, his father and brother sat by her bed and held her hands and wept while she swallowed handfuls of pills and told them how dearly she loved them) and the publication of his first novel. </p> <p>But nothing 'explains' how three times he came to be laid so low, and how now he takes pills and sees a therapist to keep the demon at bay. He offers a set of simple instructions to other sufferers (listen to people who love you, seek out memories, block out terrible thoughts as they approach, be brave, exercise, eat). His book, he insists, was not cathartic, but a way of reaching out to others in their isolation, a way of explaining them to us. At its heart, it is deeply idealistic in its intent: 'Words are strong and love is the other way forwards.' </p> <p>Solomon's experience of depression, which comes like a gale force wind and departs quietly, forms only part of The Noonday Demon, though it is the emotional undertow through the whole of it. He portrays the pain of others, in different cultures and histories, showing that far from being a disease of the wealthy and the leisured classes and of modernity, it has always been with us under different names. Hippocrates wrote about it, as did Homer, Galen, Thomas Aquinas, Shakespeare, Baudelaire, Keats, Virginia Woolf and Freud. </p> <p>The poor feel it (but, although depression cuts across all the classes, treatment of it does not), as do the the war-torn. He goes to Cambodia (where he was 'humbled down to the ground' by the courage of the people he met) and meets people who have lived through war and loss such as he can hardly imagine. One woman teaches him that the way through the darkness is by 'forgetting, working, loving'. He goes to Greenland, where up to 80 per cent of the population are depressed and the suicide rate is 0.35 per cent per year. He visits elderly people in homes; he goes to hospitals and slums. </p> <p>He looks at the medical and alternative cures - anti-depressants, anxiety controllers, St John's Wort, exercise, work, food, massage, homoeopathy. He tries out different therapies (psychoanalysis, he says, is good at expressing depression, not good at changing it - it's like firing a machine gun at an incoming tide). He goes to talk groups. He gathers stories from all over the country, from sufferers and doctors, from people who have cut their flesh to ribbons and drunk themselves into stupors, from people who have been terribly abused, from people who have come out the other side. </p> <p>More young people die of depression than of Aids, heart disease, pneumonia, cancer and strokes put together. One in 10 people in America is on drugs to help their moods. Five per cent of its teenagers are clinically depressed. Fifteen per cent of people who are depressed eventually kill themselves. </p> <p>Some people kill themselves, Solomon says, to simplify things. He remembers thinking that he himself didn't have the energy to wash the dishes or take a shower, so he might as well go and die rather than face the mundane tasks that make up a day, a life. But while 'living death is not pretty, unlike dead death, it offers the hope for amelioration'. </p> <p>Solomon is inclusive in his theories as well as his stories. There has long been a discussion about whether depression is an illness or an extreme version of ordinary sadness, whether it reveals or assaults a personality. Both, he says. What are the boundaries of identity, what do we mean by 'self'? If depression is 'just' chemical, so, too, is love. Medicine might release a sufferer from the trap, but it does not reinvent him or her. Depression springs like a beast from outside, yet is wired in the brain and runs through the veins. 'The real me lives in the world; the self exists in the narrow space where the world and our choices come together.' The depression he experiences is part of the man that he is. </p> <p>What Solomon unequivocally and with a raw, sometimes disturbing, romanticism, believes in is the authenticity, even the gift, of his endured pain. To be happy all the time is a spooky, even terrifying idea or a form of idiocy. He quotes a Russian expression: if you wake up feeling no pain, you're dead. He quotes Ovid: 'Welcome this pain.' He believes his own grief and darkness have shown him the 'acreage and reach' of his soul. He writes that 'the individuality of each person's struggle is unbreachable' and that depression, 'like sex, retains an unquenchable aura of mystery. It is new every time'. </p> <p>It is 'fire in the blood'; it nearly kills him but it produces from him words and poetry that he would not otherwise have uttered, and teaches him a better way of living and loving. </p> <p>By the end of the book's long journey, he claims that he has learnt to love his depression as a way of learning to love himself. He knows it is lurking inside him still, and will one day probably ambush him again, but he closes with ardent, melancholy optimism: 'Each day I choose to be alive. Is that not a rare joy?'</p>",

As Hazlitt said, they show us 'all that we are, all that we wish to be, and all that we dread to be'. John Gielgud, Laurence Olivier and Ralph Richardson divided this triple task between them. Richardson - a wise clown and, therefore, a definitive Falstaff - was what we are. Olivier, in the poisoned deformity of Richard III or the savagery of Othello, showed us a face we recognise with dread. It was left to Gielgud to impersonate our better selves. </p> <p>He was incapable of playing evil, as a critic remarked when he attempted Shylock. (By contrast, Olivier's Shylock indulged in a Hitlerian jig of homicidal merriment when he learnt that Antonio's argosy had foundered.) His Hamlet, as Audrey Williamson said, was 'a fey, fairy prince', not Olivier's brutal joker. When young, he specialised in a refined, decorous lyricism. His Romeo was politely enamoured; Olivier's was on heat, rampant with desire. Growing older, Gielgud became an elegist, whose watery eyes and fluting tremolo voice grieved, as Alan Bennett's schoolmaster in Forty Years On or Peter Greenaway's self-disbelieving magus in Prospero's Books, over all we have lost. As an old man, he was much in demand at memorial services, and sometimes turned up at the wrong church to intone: 'Fear no more the heat of the sun' at the burials of total strangers. </p> <p>When Olivier played Henry V, Charles Laughton told him: 'You are England', which is why Olivier could so shockingly embody England's post-imperial shame when he appeared in John Osborne's The Entertainer. Gielgud, by contrast, was never heroic, disliked clanking round in armour and was terrified of clambering onto horseback. (His mount rebuffed him in Mankiewicz's film of Julius Caesar and rolled over on top of the squealing thespian.)

As Hazlitt said, they show us 'all that we are, all that we wish to be, and all that we dread to be'. John Gielgud, Laurence Olivier and Ralph Richardson divided this triple task between them. Richardson - a wise clown and, therefore, a definitive Falstaff - was what we are. Olivier, in the poisoned deformity of Richard III or the savagery of Othello, showed us a face we recognise with dread. It was left to Gielgud to impersonate our better selves. He was incapable of playing evil, as a critic remarked when he attempted Shylock. (By contrast, Olivier's Shylock indulged in a Hitlerian jig of homicidal merriment when he learnt that Antonio's argosy had foundered.) His Hamlet, as Audrey Williamson said, was 'a fey, fairy prince', not Olivier's brutal joker. When young, he specialised in a refined, decorous lyricism. His Romeo was politely enamoured; Olivier's was on heat, rampant with desire. Growing older, Gielgud became an elegist, whose watery eyes and fluting tremolo voice grieved, as Alan Bennett's schoolmaster in Forty Years On or Peter Greenaway's self-disbelieving magus in Prospero's Books, over all we have lost. As an old man, he was much in demand at memorial services, and sometimes turned up at the wrong church to intone: 'Fear no more the heat of the sun' at the burials of total strangers. When Olivier played Henry V, Charles Laughton told him: 'You are England', which is why Olivier could so shockingly embody England's post-imperial shame when he appeared in John Osborne's The Entertainer. Gielgud, by contrast, was never heroic, disliked clanking round in armour and was terrified of clambering onto horseback. (His mount rebuffed him in Mankiewicz's film of Julius Caesar and rolled over on top of the squealing thespian.) But in his own way, he helped define national identity, which is, after all, a theatrical role. The Olivier who rallied his troops at Agincourt in the name of England and St George came from a Huguenot family. Gielgud caught the English, elegiac mood so well because he was actually a Slav.

Only a silent genius could have created the world-without-end works that each generation varnishes in cultural piety. Katherine Duncan-Jones's constantly illuminating and hugely enjoyable biography restores the author and his plays to bubbly life. Shakespeare left a documentary trail, pellets of commercial and legal transaction that want only motivation. While recent biographies have either been utterly scrupulous or recklessly conjectural, Duncan-Jones is sufficiently secure in her evidence to speculate with persuasive flair. </p> <p>Shakespeare's desire to be 'gentle' has nothing to do with literary emollience but with attaining gentlemanly status. She unearths his dealings with the Heralds' College, unpicking his coat of arms - a golden spear, silver-tipped, crested by a swaggering falcon. In an agonising aftermath, his contact at the Heralds was publicly discredited, casting a stain over the dramatist's right to bear arms. </p> <p>Purse strings tug this story. Shakespeare gets rich through playing the marketplace, speculating on audience taste. Fashions alter, plague and authority may lock the theatre doors, and you sense a comfortable artist dogged by vulnerability. Shakespeare ducked his parish dues and passed on philanthropy, while his will is a calibration of scores tightfistedly settled. Godchildren cast into the cold, his younger daughter slighted, his wife allowed only a final twist of the knife and his second-best bed. 'Curst be he that moves my bones,' snarls his gravestone, ensuring that no relations will snuggle up for all eternity. </p> <p>With sex, the author again skeeters around uncertainty, but constructs a convincing picture. Her William thrums with adolescent energies and marries Anne Hathaway when she becomes pregnant. The resented union soon loses steam, and thereafter London answers his desire. His most ardent relationships, Duncan-Jones argues, are with men. In an age of female patrons, Shakespeare dedicates amorous verse only to rakish young aristocrats: on paper at least, he builds a rhetoric of intimacy with the glamorous Earl of Southampton, blazing through his inheritance; and the Earl of Pembroke. </p> <p>Friendly rivalries with younger authors seem to spur Shakespeare, writing in collaboration and competition with keen John Marston or John Fletcher. Another co-writer is fingered for leading Shakespeare astray. Pericles was composed with George Wilkins, a second-rate talent given to violence - kicking at a pregnant belly, lashing at whores from his tavern-cum-brothel. Where previous biographers dissever the Wilkins connection, Duncan-Jones implicates Shakespeare in his rough boys' games. Hanging with Wilkins in disreputable Clerkenwell, Shakespeare may have sharpened his cynicism about female integrity, and perhaps also contracted the syphilis that Duncan-Jones speculates eventually killed him. </p> <p>Above all, Ungentle Shakespeare describes a theatrical career. Duncan-Jones celebrates the Stratford grammar education that helped Shakespeare join a throng of talents from the West Midlands, but pays sustained attention to the Whitsun plays and royal progresses, ladders of patronage that might have led to the London stage. She portrays Shakespeare the distinguished actor, and notes his contemporary hits. The writer first seized public imagination with rumbustious histories and their 'high-style slaughter of innocents' and became a student pin-up with Hamlet. These successes remind us that if the writer is 'ungentle', so too is his work: Kenneth Gross's intriguing study <strong> Shakespeare's Noise </strong> (University of Chicago \u00a326.50; \u00a311, pp282) kneads the violent language of curse, insult and vicious slander that animates the plays. </p> <p>Productions of The Tempest increasingly discover an angry, troubling play. Rather than a benign Prospero dropping his staff and mulching into bucolic retirement, Duncan-Jones proposes a weary writer packing it in when the Globe burnt down during a performance of Henry VIII , and going ungently into that good night. It is hardly news that a writer may enjoy an imaginative life richer, kinder than his pragmatic circumstance.

But beyond the violent fringe of the raggle-taggle army of May Day demonstrators is a disparate but powerful coalition that cannot be dismissed as easily as were the previous generations that called for the overthrow of capitalism. </p> <p>It was the appearance of the anti-capitalist demonstrators in Seattle in November 1999 that first made business leaders take notice of the concerns about globalisation. Subsequent events have maintained the pressure. </p> <p>Company chairmen forced to cower behind police lines cannot help but be impressed by the strength of feeling and the powers of organisation of people who might be ignored if they contented themselves with polite protest. </p> <p>Business is listening, but the demonstrations have done little to spell out to business leaders what is expected of them - beyond being a bit nicer and more generous. </p> <p>The loosely knit movement is better at posing questions - questions that the business world has found difficult to answer - such as why South African Aids sufferers should be denied access to cheap treatment, and why much of the affluent world's expensive consumer goods are produced in conditions of poverty. </p> <p>Such questions have transformed what had been a genteel debate within the business world on corporate social responsibility (CSR). </p> <p>When he was appointed last year as the first minister in Europe to hold a CSR portfolio, the Department of Trade Minister Kim Howells saw his mission as encouraging business to do good. The Government views CSR as 'a wide-ranging agenda that involves businesses looking at how to improve their social, environmental and local economic impact, their influence on society, social cohesion, human rights and fair trade'. </p> <p>The South African pharmaceutical patent affair, which saw the world's biggest drug companies back down, plus the vicious assault on Huntingdon Life Sciences and its financial backers, have demonstrated just how wide-ranging that agenda is. Then factor in the question of slave labour in cocoa plantations, the relationship between supermarkets and farmers and BP shareholders' demands for a strategy 'beyond petroleum' - and that's just in the past week or two. </p> <p>The force of the attack has been strengthened because it has penetrated the system. Socially responsible investors, such as those putting pressure on BP and other oil companies, bring the arguments to the boardroom. </p> <p>One response has been a drive within business for greater responsibility and openness. For example, the EU has backed a new organisation, CSR Europe, which was behind the European Parliament's first conference on corporate responsibility 10 days ago. </p> <p>Former EU vice-president Etienne Davignon, who chairs CSR Europe, told the conference: 'We need to make corporate social responsibility and sustainable development, together with peace, human rights and democracy, the guiding principles of the twenty-first century.' </p> <p>There is still a blindness in some parts of the business world to anything which goes beyond philanthropy. Elsewhere, however, Davignon demonstrates a growing acceptance that companies must address how they make money, not just how much they give away, and they must account for how they behave. </p> <p>Self-interest is a significant driver of this growing concern. For example, companies with strong brands (such as Nike and Adidas) have realised they must protect their reputations. That means, among other things, trying to ensure suppliers do not employ children or pay low wages. </p> <p>Paradoxically for the anti-capitalists, a task force headed by BT's former managing director, Bill Cockburn, recently argued that this would actually help companies make higher profits. </p> <p>'This [social responsibility] isn't about making a feelgood contribution to charity,' Cockburn said in launching his report at last year's CBI conference. 'It's about the basic way of doing business and it can actually save you a lot of money.' That is not likely to please the serious anti-capitalists. But there is confusion in their ranks about what needs to be done by business. </p> <p>The initial preoccupation with issues such as trade rules and mass poverty have spread to a generalised mistrust and criticism. The coalition embraces campaigns on issues such as animal welfare, climate change and genetically modified foods, but new challenges pop up almost at random. </p> <p>Some critics, such as the writer Naomi Klein, have focused on accountability and transparency, but it is far from clear what is expected of business. Take the pharmaceutical affair. The big pharmaceutical companies bowed to demands to withdraw their ill-conceived legal action blocking cheap generic treatments. But the battle leaves two huge questions hanging: how do you define which countries or which sufferers are worthy of cut-price medicines? (Or why should a poor Californian die early, just because he lives in the richest country on earth.) </p> <p>And if poor countries deserve cheap drugs, surely farmers, food companies, water utilities and other suppliers of life's necessities should be roped in to hand out cheap goods and services. </p> <p>Part of the problem is a confusion between what business can do and what can only be changed by governments and inter-governmental agencies. The line is not clear - after all, the corporate world pushed for the intellectual property agreement that underpinned the drug companies' action in the South African courts. </p> <p>But there are areas where social needs will not be met by the private sector - such as the cancellation of international debt. And there are areas where governments have to act by creating international institutions if they want some kind of control over multinationals. In the meantime, an agenda for what companies have to do can be glimpsed through the fog of anti-capitalist rhetoric. </p> <p>This agenda has generated a plethora of codes, standards and schemes to flesh out such broad demands, from the UN's Global Compact to the UK's Ethical Trading Initiative. But none of these admirable efforts at clarification and codification will answer the crucial questions that GlaxoSmithKline and Tesco have both stumbled across in the last couple of weeks: what is a decent price, and how much profit is too much? </p> <p>There is no simple answer but companies need to accept that the rules have changed; that profit alone is no longer enough. It requires a much fuller awareness of the business, such as knowing where your cocoa beans come from and how they are produced. And companies must openly confront the issues. </p> <p>That means, first knowing, understanding and talking to critics - the ones that aren't throwing the stones and petrol bombs, that is. </p> <p><strong>Checklist for right-thinking companies</strong></p> <p> \u0095 Pay suppliers properly </p> <p>\u0095 Pay workers decent wages </p> <p>\u0095 Don't rip off customers or exclude those in poverty </p> <p>\u0095 Cut use of natural resources, especially fossil fuels </p> <p>\u0095 Cut waste and pollution </p> <p>\u0095 Respect animals and the environment </p> <p>\u0095 Lobby for all these things, and not against them and, by the way, also make a reasonable return for shareholders</p>",

Elsewhere, however, Davignon demonstrates a growing acceptance that companies must address how they make money, not just how much they give away, and they must account for how they behave. Self-interest is a significant driver of this growing concern. For example, companies with strong brands (such as Nike and Adidas) have realised they must protect their reputations. That means, among other things, trying to ensure suppliers do not employ children or pay low wages. Paradoxically for the anti-capitalists, a task force headed by BT's former managing director, Bill Cockburn, recently argued that this would actually help companies make higher profits. 'This [social responsibility] isn't about making a feelgood contribution to charity,' Cockburn said in launching his report at last year's CBI conference. 'It's about the basic way of doing business and it can actually save you a lot of money.' That is not likely to please the serious anti-capitalists. But there is confusion in their ranks about what needs to be done by business. The initial preoccupation with issues such as trade rules and mass poverty have spread to a generalised mistrust and criticism. The coalition embraces campaigns on issues such as animal welfare, climate change and genetically modified foods, but new challenges pop up almost at random. Some critics, such as the writer Naomi Klein, have focused on accountability and transparency, but it is far from clear what is expected of business. Take the pharmaceutical affair. The big pharmaceutical companies bowed to demands to withdraw their ill-conceived legal action blocking cheap generic treatments. But the battle leaves two huge questions hanging: how do you define which countries or which sufferers are worthy of cut-price medicines? (Or why should a poor Californian die early, just because he lives in the richest country on earth.) And if poor countries deserve cheap drugs, surely farmers, food companies, water utilities and other suppliers of life's necessities should be roped in to hand out cheap goods and services. Part of the problem is a confusion between what business can do and what can only be changed by governments and inter-governmental agencies. The line is not clear - after all, the corporate world pushed for the intellectual property agreement that underpinned the drug companies' action in the South African courts. But there are areas where social needs will not be met by the private sector - such as the cancellation of international debt. And there are areas where governments have to act by creating international institutions if they want some kind of control over multinationals. In the meantime, an agenda for what companies have to do can be glimpsed through the fog of anti-capitalist rhetoric. This agenda has generated a plethora of codes, standards and schemes to flesh out such broad demands, from the UN's Global Compact to the UK's Ethical Trading Initiative. But none of these admirable efforts at clarification and codification will answer the crucial questions that GlaxoSmithKline and Tesco have both stumbled across in the last couple of weeks: what is a decent price, and how much profit is too much? There is no simple answer but companies need to accept that the rules have changed; that profit alone is no longer enough. It requires a much fuller awareness of the business, such as knowing where your cocoa beans come from and how they are produced. And companies must openly confront the issues. That means, first knowing, understanding and talking to critics - the ones that aren't throwing the stones and petrol bombs, that is. Checklist for right-thinking companies \u0095 Pay suppliers properly \u0095 Pay workers decent wages \u0095 Don't rip off customers or exclude those in poverty \u0095 Cut use of natural resources, especially fossil fuels \u0095 Cut waste and pollution \u0095 Respect animals and the environment \u0095 Lobby for all these things, and not against them and, by the way, also make a reasonable return for shareholders",

But this colossus of global capitalism sympathises with some of the causes espoused by such protests around the world. </p> <p>'There's considerable justification for being critical of the present arrangement [in the global economy],' he says. 'Anti-globalisation is a movement that has put Third World debt on the agenda. It may have a violent fringe, but there's some very serious forces and movements involved.' </p> <p>Before meeting Soros, one expects a lesson in risk premiums, hedge funds and, above all, about being feared by the world's central bankers. What you get is more akin to philosophical treatise. </p> <p>Soros' philanthropy is well documented. He has set up many foundations in the former eastern bloc, particularly the Balkans. But his staff say most of his time is taken up by concern for 'an open society and reforming the international financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank'. </p> <p>The controversy over drugs patents is an important issue for him. 'Intellectual property rights is a good slogan for creating monopolies,' he says.

Also, it's anti-competitive, in a way. Now you need to have a patent in order to allow investment but you also have to limit this to make sure the benefits reach people.' </p> <p>Soros thinks about globalisation a lot. He is reading The Great Transformation by the economic historian Karl Polanyi. Its central thesis concerns friction between the 'self-regulating market economy' and the traditional forces of 'national and social protection'. Polanyi believed capitalism to be a historical anomaly because it usurps normal social relations. 'It's a brilliant analysis of the problems of globalisation as they developed in the nineteenth century - the problems we have today are not new,' says Soros. </p> <p>His critics in South-east Asia are acutely aware of the turmoil that financial liberalisation can cause. The prime ministers of Thailand and Malaysia blamed the financier for helping precipitate the 1997 Asian financial crisis. He abandoned a trip to Bangkok after protests and threats. </p> <p>On the other hand, isn't talk of a reform agenda for globalisation a bit of a luxury amid fears of global recession? 'On the contrary,' Soros says, 'this is the real agenda. I think the system itself is in danger, and there's more fundamental and systemic issues than this particular economic slowdown. </p> <p>'I think our existing institutions will keep the slowdown within tolerable bounds in the developed world. But it may have some more adverse consequences in the outlying parts, which have already been weakened by the emerging markets crisis.' </p> <p>This is just the latest manifestation of a 'centre-periphery' problem where markets are globalised without a concomitant globalisation of power. His solution is reforms to create a fairer system of global institutions for all countries. </p> <p>'We need to establish this principle, because the system is fundamentally uneven, the playing field is uneven. We have to find the incentives for good government, for instance providing budgetary support for education, which would enable those countries to eliminate child labour.' </p> <p>He talks of global leaders adopting the ideas of Amartya Sen, the Cambridge-based Nobel prizewinner in economics. Sen's book, Development as Freedom, has become a manifesto of sorts for what might be termed 'progressive globalisation'. Lionel Jospin, the French prime minister, talks about it as a model. James Wolfensohn, the World Bank president, gets Sen to lecture his staff. And Gordon Brown, the Chancellor, has held seminars for him at Number 11. </p> <p>Sen argues that 'to be generically against markets would be almost as odd as being generically against conversation.

Development is more than just economic growth, and should focus on health and education. Economic reforms should not obviate the need for building these basic capabilities. </p> <p>And what Sen has advocated in economics, Soros is pushing for in politics. The financier thinks that far from there being too much globalisation, the process hasn't gone far enough. Free trade in agriculture, for example, would greatly reducepoverty in poor countries. This is why 'anti-globalisation' protests may be misplaced. </p> <p>'There is a strange coalition of very different forces that is united in trying to destroy or undermine our international institutions. It's very unfortunate because this combination has in fact weakened the international institutions - we don't have a viable alternative to the global economy. A breakdown in it would undermine our prosperity. </p> <p>'So we need to form a different coalition which would recognise the shortcomings of the present arrangements and instead of destroying the existing institutions would create the missing ones - those that would protect human values - of democracy, environmental standards, labour standards, and what I would call a level playing field.' </p> <p>But is this call for truly global governance realistic in the current international climate? </p> <p>Anyone who has participated in financial markets, as Soros has, seems to develop an unalienable belief in self-fulfiling prophecies and the importance of credibility and confidence.

Faced with three opportunities for disruption in a fortnight, the protesters were out in force in Quebec at the American trade summit, but, drawing breath before May-Day, they were in short supply at the spring meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund in Washington last weekend. </p> <p>This was just as well, because we financial commentators did not go into this business with the same motives as those colleagues who fret when they are away from a war zone. Nor did the finance ministers, central bankers and officials who take part in the regular round of international economic discussions. They are resigned to a busy life, but prefer a quiet one, too. The ritual trashing of McDonald's has yet to make it on to the ever- expanding agenda of the Group of Seven leading finance ministers. </p> <p>Perhaps it was their natural pacifism that induced participants at the G7 meeting to seek headlines of the 'peace breaks out' variety. They almost succeeded. After a week during the run-up to the meeting when the International Monetary Fund was extremely critical in public of the European Central Bank's refusal to cut interest rates, the tone of the actual meeting was noticeably more restrained and polite. </p> <p>The Bush administration may be at odds with Europe over everything from Son of Star Wars to global warming, but there was a lot of respectful listening on the economic front last weekend, with the British agreeably surprised at US Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill's support for their ambitious plans to reduce poverty, and the European Central Bank feeling it had received a respectful hearing for its seemingly intransigent position on interest rates. </p> <p>True, there was slight embarrassment when ECB President Willem Duisenberg said the G7 had written 'it is not our intent to give directions to each other', but the implied declaration of respect for ECB independence was not in the final draft of the communiqu\u00e9. </p> <p>True, the British thought they had effected a minor coup in getting the G7 to agree to be 'vigilant and forward-looking' - code for urging the ECB to cut rates before eurozone inflation turns down - but it was all pretty small beer. </p> <p>Negotiators and eager newshounds get overexcited at these meetings. It would be news if policy makers were not supposed to be 'vigilant and forward-looking'. What the ECB is looking forward to is the prospect of eurozone inflation getting worse before it gets better. There is every sign that earlier criticism from others has merely hardened the ECB's position. </p> <p>It is different when the specific policy goals are negotiated into G7 communiqu\u00e9s. Some years ago, the G7 began an attack on 'money laundering', and this led to procedures which made the attack a reality. Similarly, relief of Third World debt - painfully slow though it has proved - became part of the international bureaucratic process. </p> <p>There was even a breakfast meeting within the IMF headquarters where Paul Martin, the Canadian Finance Minister, and our own Gordon Brown were telling representatives of the aid agencies (generally known these days as NGOs) that they could not do what they were trying to do on the debt, poverty and health fronts without the NGOs, and an NGO representative was saying: 'We can't do what we do without you and your political leadership'. </p> <p>Not only are the NGOs allowed within the building, but before one comes to the IMF and World Bank handouts (no pun intended), the document that strikes you is 'Reality Check - The need for deeper debt cancellation and the fight against HIV/Aids', a report by Drop the Debt. It tells you - within the hallowed precincts of the IMF building - that 'the World Bank and IMF preach economic integration of all countries, but only enforce trade liberalisation in poor countries'. </p> <p>Well, they're working on it. The communiqu\u00e9 stated: 'We look forward to further discussions on moving beyond debt relief in preparation for the Genoa Summit. In this context, we underscore the importance of focusing on steps to increase opportunities for trade...' </p> <p>The spectre at the feast of last week's meetings was of course the economy of the host country: the US itself. With a great sense of timing the US administration unveiled first-quarter figures suggesting that the US economic growth rate had picked up from 1 per cent a year in October-December 2000 to 2 per cent a year in January-March. </p> <p>But this is not as good as it sounds. It suggests an average of 1.5 per cent over the six months, which is well below the estimated growth of productive potential (of perhaps 3 per cent) at which the economy has to grow to prevent unemployment rising. </p> <p>Basically, the US economy is already in what economists call a 'growth recession'. The profits squeeze resulting from a classic business-cycle phase of overinvestment is producing a steady stream of redundancy announcements in the US and from US multinationals around the world. </p> <p>The optimistic view is that as consumers 'refinance' their mortgages at lower interest rates, consumption, which weakened in the course of the first quarter, will pick up. The pessimistic view is that the redundancies caused by the 'bust' that has followed the boom will erode real incomes and consumer confidence, and prolong the growth recession. </p> <p>George Bush is not thanked for having talked the recession up (and the economy down) when he came to office - a ploy that seems to have been inspired, if that is the word, by a desire to find a Keynesian justification for tax cuts long planned for dubious 'supply-side' reasons. </p> <p>The tax cuts are shamelessly aimed at the rich, some of whom are even criticising them as being socially unfair. But it is interesting that they have been welcomed by Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan. </p> <p>Greenspan's critics believe he has been shamelessly political in reversing his position (he used to prefer debt reduction to tax cuts) and has finally come out in his true right-wing Republican colours. But it may also be that he believes cutting interest rates in the face of the collapse of an investment boom is like Keynes's classic 'pushing on a string' and has suddenly rediscovered fiscal policy as a tool of demand management. </p> <p>My own feeling is that the US economic slowdown is serious - 'the bigger the boom, the bigger the bust' - and that it is not surprising the US administration wants Europe to show some economic leadership, however discreetly the argument is now being put. In these circumstances, while affirming that it believes in 'a strong dollar' all the way to the bank, the US Treasury would probably not be averse to a gentle depreciation of the dollar against the euro, to help hard-pressed US multinationals. </p> <p>As for the UK, the overvaluation of the pound becomes more and more obvious and, taken with the fall-out from the US growth recession, the outlook seems to be deteriorating fast. The G7 communiqu\u00e9 said: 'The [UK] slowdown appears to be only moderate' - but that was written as long as a week ago. From the Treasury's point of view this will be the 'just-in-time' election.</p>",

True, the British thought they had effected a minor coup in getting the G7 to agree to be 'vigilant and forward-looking' - code for urging the ECB to cut rates before eurozone inflation turns down - but it was all pretty small beer. Negotiators and eager newshounds get overexcited at these meetings. It would be news if policy makers were not supposed to be 'vigilant and forward-looking'. What the ECB is looking forward to is the prospect of eurozone inflation getting worse before it gets better. There is every sign that earlier criticism from others has merely hardened the ECB's position. It is different when the specific policy goals are negotiated into G7 communiqu\u00e9s. Some years ago, the G7 began an attack on 'money laundering', and this led to procedures which made the attack a reality. Similarly, relief of Third World debt - painfully slow though it has proved - became part of the international bureaucratic process. There was even a breakfast meeting within the IMF headquarters where Paul Martin, the Canadian Finance Minister, and our own Gordon Brown were telling representatives of the aid agencies (generally known these days as NGOs) that they could not do what they were trying to do on the debt, poverty and health fronts without the NGOs, and an NGO representative was saying: 'We can't do what we do without you and your political leadership'. Not only are the NGOs allowed within the building, but before one comes to the IMF and World Bank handouts (no pun intended), the document that strikes you is 'Reality Check - The need for deeper debt cancellation and the fight against HIV/Aids', a report by Drop the Debt. It tells you - within the hallowed precincts of the IMF building - that 'the World Bank and IMF preach economic integration of all countries, but only enforce trade liberalisation in poor countries'. Well, they're working on it. The communiqu\u00e9 stated: 'We look forward to further discussions on moving beyond debt relief in preparation for the Genoa Summit. In this context, we underscore the importance of focusing on steps to increase opportunities for trade...' The spectre at the feast of last week's meetings was of course the economy of the host country: the US itself. With a great sense of timing the US administration unveiled first-quarter figures suggesting that the US economic growth rate had picked up from 1 per cent a year in October-December 2000 to 2 per cent a year in January-March. But this is not as good as it sounds. It suggests an average of 1.5 per cent over the six months, which is well below the estimated growth of productive potential (of perhaps 3 per cent) at which the economy has to grow to prevent unemployment rising. Basically, the US economy is already in what economists call a 'growth recession'. The profits squeeze resulting from a classic business-cycle phase of overinvestment is producing a steady stream of redundancy announcements in the US and from US multinationals around the world. The optimistic view is that as consumers 'refinance' their mortgages at lower interest rates, consumption, which weakened in the course of the first quarter, will pick up. The pessimistic view is that the redundancies caused by the 'bust' that has followed the boom will erode real incomes and consumer confidence, and prolong the growth recession. George Bush is not thanked for having talked the recession up (and the economy down) when he came to office - a ploy that seems to have been inspired, if that is the word, by a desire to find a Keynesian justification for tax cuts long planned for dubious 'supply-side' reasons. The tax cuts are shamelessly aimed at the rich, some of whom are even criticising them as being socially unfair. But it is interesting that they have been welcomed by Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan. Greenspan's critics believe he has been shamelessly political in reversing his position (he used to prefer debt reduction to tax cuts) and has finally come out in his true right-wing Republican colours. But it may also be that he believes cutting interest rates in the face of the collapse of an investment boom is like Keynes's classic 'pushing on a string' and has suddenly rediscovered fiscal policy as a tool of demand management. My own feeling is that the US economic slowdown is serious - 'the bigger the boom, the bigger the bust' - and that it is not surprising the US administration wants Europe to show some economic leadership, however discreetly the argument is now being put. In these circumstances, while affirming that it believes in 'a strong dollar' all the way to the bank, the US Treasury would probably not be averse to a gentle depreciation of the dollar against the euro, to help hard-pressed US multinationals. As for the UK, the overvaluation of the pound becomes more and more obvious and, taken with the fall-out from the US growth recession, the outlook seems to be deteriorating fast. The G7 communiqu\u00e9 said: 'The [UK] slowdown appears to be only moderate' - but that was written as long as a week ago. From the Treasury's point of view this will be the 'just-in-time' election.",

      "body": "<p>Sean Penn quit smoking on his 40th birthday, and at this moment, 26 American Spirit-less days in - nicotine patches are for wimps - he is as miserable as a happy man can be. Over lunch at an outdoor restaurant near his home in Marin County, north of San Francisco, he worries a hole in the paper tablecloth with his thumb, then works on enlarging it. His fingernails are bitten to the quick. He consumes two main courses - fried-calamari followed by a hamburger platter. Breakfast was steak and eggs and chips, coffee and Coke. </p> <p>A little later in the afternoon, on the way to George Lucas's Skywalker Ranch to screen a movie by a young Israeli director who interests him, Penn stops at a drive-in for another hamburger. 'You're seeing the evidence of the post-cigarette bloat,' he says with a wan smile, sitting down with his tray. </p> <p>He's probably carrying a few extra pounds, but he looks good. With his Vandyke beard, big, square head, and long, strong nose, he bears a passing resemblance to Ezra Pound in his middle years. </p> <p>These are Sean Penn's middle years: how amazing. His small, sleepy blue eyes, with their perpetual look of challenge or disbelief, are fringed with fine lines. It's an arresting, monumental, worrisome face: looking at him, you think, What else could somebody with a face like this do but be a movie star? </p> <p>He takes off his black leather jacket, and under the rolled-up shirtsleeve on his left forearm, I spy a large, ornate tattoo of a shackled demon with the caption DELIVER ME in Gothic letters. Deliver me from what? Evil? The celebrity press? His own demons? </p> <p>As we know well by now, Sean Penn, a reasonably public figure, has mixed feelings about public exposure. As the survivor of enough unwanted publicity to last a lifetime - primarily for his pugnacity with the press during his brief and tumultuous mid-80s marriage to Madonna - he is nobody's media whore. He has a long and sensitive relationship with paparazzi (in 1987 he spent 34 days in jail for punching an amateur paparazzo, an extra who tried to take his picture on a movie set). He gives interviews sparingly and reluctantly. Yet as a performer who has consistently taken roles in challenging films, as opposed to films that earn big money, he has effectively turned himself into an actor's actor, a remote star with a lingering air of menace and inaccessibility, all of which continues to make him an object of fascination. </p> <p>Soon, Penn tells me, he'll begin rehearsals for a Sam Shepard play ( The Late Henry Moss ) that will run for six weeks in San Francisco; then he'll star in an independent picture called The Assassination of Richard Nixon ('That's a good story,' he says, smiling). 'Then I should make another movie,' Penn says. </p> <p>That's not make as in 'act in'. He's talking about his true love: writing and directing dark, quirky, performance-driven movies in which he does not perform. The problem thus far, however - if his first two pictures, The Indian Runner and The Crossing Guard, are any indication - is that filmmaker Penn's movies don't perform at the box office. </p> <p>With his third film, The Pledge, Sean Penn is trying to rip out of the box - but by his own rules. Like The Crossing Guard, The Pledge stars Jack Nicholson and features Robin Wright Penn. Like both of his previous films, it is dark. And once again, Sean Penn will not appear in front of the cameras. Based loosely on the Friedrich D\u00fcrrenmatt novel, The Pledge is the story of a retired homicide detective (Nicholson) who can't let a long-closed child-killing case go. Tracking a suspect to the Sierra Nevada, he pursues his love of fishing while waiting to reel in the killer. </p> <p> The Pledge will be distributed by a major studio, Warner Bros. It was financed by an independent production company called Franchise Pictures, was budgeted at a relatively modest $30m - $10m of which goes to pay Nicholson's full fee - and was shot on a shoestring in Vancouver. 'It's a retirement-crisis story disguised as a thriller, let's put it that way,' the writer/director says. 'I didn't get the retirement-crisis story financed, if you know what I mean. But I got it shot.' He grins. </p> <p>Another quirky character study, in other words. But a quirky character study with a three-act structure and plot payoff at the end. Besides Nicholson and Wright, The Pledge also stars Vanessa Redgrave, Helen Mirren, Mickey Rourke, Harry Dean Stanton and Sam Shepard. Nevertheless, distinguished cast aside, Penn the filmmaker is realistic about the studio's involvement, and about why this might be his first project to win a wider audience. 'It's a very different kind of movie than my first two,' Penn says. 'I think everybody considers it much more accessible.' </p> <p>As always, however, Sean Penn has his own version of accessibility. </p> <p>There have always been demons. They were there before Penn fired a gun at press helicopters covering his 1986 wedding to Madonna; they were there before the many fist fights won and lost; they are, in the midst of his happiness, there still. </p> <p>Sunset: we're driving back from the Skywalker Ranch screening - two hours of dark and quirky doings among Orthodox Jews in Jerusalem, sort of a Sean Penn movie with yarmulkes. Penn is at the wheel of his black BMW, accelerating over back-country switchbacks in central Marin. He drives to relax, but he is not an especially relaxed driver. Seat-beltless, he leans over the steering wheel, his goatee jutting defiantly as he scans the road for enemies. Passing through a small town, we soon find ourselves behind one: a very slow Mercedes. 'Come on, sir,' he moans. ' Where is it you think you're not going ?' </p> <p>A long scar below his right eyebrow puts me in mind of a scene in The Crossing Guard in which Robin Wright asks ex-con David Morse about a similar scar on his forehead. Morse tells her he got it banging his head against the wall. 'You just couldn't stand jail?' Wright asks. 'No, I just couldn't stand me,' Morse says. </p> <p>Penn wrote the line. </p> <p>He is, by his own admission, 'a big drinker', even though the court-appointed psychotherapist he consulted after getting out of jail determined he was not an alcoholic. He tells a story against himself: during the earthquake that rattled the counties north of San Francisco in early September, 'I'd had a couple of drinks,' he says. 'I was in my editing room with some people, and suddenly everybody sat down. Fast. I thought that was odd.' He smiles. </p> <p>It is tempting to think of him as a perpetual rebel, an adolescent in arrest, rather than as a 40-year-old family man - husband to Robin Wright Penn, father to their nine-year-old daughter Dylan Frances and seven-year-old son Hopper Jack. But when I ask where he's headed this evening, he says, 'I'm gonna go home and read to my kids. I tried Harry Potter, but it didn't take. Plus it was too hard to act, doing all those voices.' </p> <p>It's tempting to remember all the bad behaviour, the indelible template laid down in Fast Times at Ridgemont High and Bad Boys and Racing With the Moon and The Falcon and the Snowman - the remote, sneering, mesmerising man-boy with the little, close-set eyes. </p> <p>'So how was turning 40?' I ask him. </p> <p>He laughs a little. 'Yeah-how about that?' he says. </p> <p>'How'd it hit you?' </p> <p>'Well, it was a disaster,' he says. 'I had always told myself that I really should quit smoking at 30. OK, 35. Always, 40 was: there's no choice any more, you just have to do it.' </p> <p>'Why?' </p> <p>'It was time not to be a slave to this nonsense, you know? I mean, if I could smoke eight cigarettes a day, I'd smoke the rest of my life. But it's worse than that with me. I smoke four packs like that .' </p> <p>I ask if the birthday itself, as a landmark, was difficult. </p> <p>He shakes his head. 'I don't really have a thing about that,' he says. 'I'll go 50, 60 - I don't care. This is not an area of my girlie sensibility. You know, there's that thing: what age do you see yourself as? Always felt I'm more like 76. That's when I'll say, \"Oh finally!\" I'll feel old at 77.' </p> <p>He hasn't plucked that number out of nowhere. Penn's father, the director (and actor) Leo Penn, died at 77 - of lung cancer - two years ago. Sean, who was in the midst of shooting Woody Allen's Sweet and Lowdown in New York as his father was dying, flew back to LA every few days to be with him. </p> <p>'I thought when he lost his dad, it humbled him,' Robin Wright Penn says. 'It took the edge off a little bit.' </p> <p>Leo Penn's acting career ended in the early 50s when he refused to name names before the House Un-American Activities Committee and was branded a Communist. Blacklisted in the movie business, he turned to television directing. One of Sean Penn's boyhood memories is watching Elia Kazan - who did name names - shoot The Last Tycoon near the Penn family home in Malibu. One day Leo Penn walked his son down to see the set. 'My dad was a very warm, polite person, and Kazan said hello to him, and [Dad] just walked by,' he remembers. </p> <p>His father's example - in every way - left a strong stamp on Penn. Trying to move from acting to directing is just the start. It's too easy to write off Penn as a self-important punk without tracking the source of his demons. Hollywood is in his blood (his mother Eileen Ryan and his younger brother Christopher are both actors), and he's furious with Hollywood. </p> <p>'It just makes you angry, the idea that a guy that goes off, fights for his country, wins all kinds of medals by risking his life, and then four years later, the country says, \"You can't work here,\"' he says. 'And I am a total believer in: it can happen again. There's signs of it all the time. The one thing you can count on in Hollywood - across the board - is cowardice.' </p> <p>'The thing that makes Sean special in Hollywood is that it takes great courage to do it on your terms, knowing you may not please the 10 guys in town that green-light pictures,' says Art Linson, who got to know Penn when he produced Fast Times and has remained his close friend for almost 20 years. 'He's not going to put out silly, likable movies so an executive at a studio will say, \"Way to go, guy - let's have dinner.\" That takes balls. Few people in this town have the courage to be good.' </p> <p>Linson is talking about both Penn's acting and his filmmaking. But none of this explains why he's always threatening to quit acting - as if it were cigarettes - when he's so brilliant at it. </p> <p>'Well, I don't like it,' Penn says. 'Sometimes maybe for a week or two I like it. But there's no comparison to being able to go out and make your movie as a director. It's already a crapshoot that it's something you're interested in - that it relates to what you want to create at all. It's somebody else's trip. And then you add your bit to it. It's a great craft, it's a great interpretive art, and I'm a fan of it, but it doesn't fill any kind of need to work; it certainly hasn't filled my bank account. I just want real creative freedom without worrying about, you know, car payments.' </p> <p>It's strange: his anger seems more abstract than it once was. I had expected - well, one actor who worked with him asked me, half jokingly, 'Has he punched you in the mouth yet?' It's something that's in the back of your mind when you sit down with Sean Penn. But it's hard to find the hot buttons; he's looser about himself than I thought he'd be. </p> <p>'What do people get wrong when they write about you?' I ask. </p> <p>'I usually read pieces about me and respond, \"That sounds like the last one,\"' he says. 'It's because I get off on the same thing every time, and it's redundant.' He laughs. 'I mean, it'd be more interesting to go on a fact-finding mission. Just pick the front page of the New York Times, and hop in a car, and let's really search it down. See who's fuckin' lying.' </p> <p>He did something very much like this recently, he tells me, mentioning a trip he took to Selma, Alabama, with a former Black Panther named Geronimo Pratt to encourage citizens to vote in the city's mayoral election. This is mildly astonishing: I hadn't heard that Penn had done any such thing. But shouldn't I have heard? Don't celebrities always make sure they make the news for their good works? There is no mention of Penn's trip on any newspaper or wire- service database: strangely enough, he went solely for the purpose of going. </p> <p>'Isn't there a potential downside in making a trip like that for somebody like you?' I ask. </p> <p>'What's the downside?' </p> <p>'Being perceived as a limousine liberal?' </p> <p>'I am a limousine liberal,' he says. </p> <p>He stops the car outside my hotel. 'Look,' he says. 'You don't have to think the world of yourself or be a great activist to do anything like that. I mean, I'm not gonna avoid idiotic comments people want to make just because you try to do something good.' </p> <p> Sean Penn is trying to do something good. He's not trying to get more famous, or very rich - though he certainly wouldn't mind making enough money to stop doing the very thing we want him to continue doing. ('Give me one cheque,' he says. 'Get rid of the acting; just make movies. Just that one cheque.') Look at the pictures he's done over the past five years: Sweet and Lowdown . The Weight of Water . Up at the Villa . Hurlyburly . The Thin Red Line . She's So Lovely . Dead Man Walking . He has frequently been magnificent. He has seldom been paid in kind. For Sweet and Lowdown , he earned scale (a little more than $2,000 a week), like all actors in Woody Allen films. For Hurlyburly , he made a reported $150,000. For The Thin Red Line , he was reportedly paid $300,000, though his deal included back-end points should the picture earn money. (It didn't.) For well-distributed independent pictures such as The Weight of Water, he earns in the low millions - a quarter of what the blockbusters he regularly turns down pay. </p> <p>He shrugs. 'I go broke all the time,' he says. 'I can't do what I've been doing - I keep doing projects, and not getting paid for them as an actor, and then I go out as a director...' </p> <p>He trails off. And make even less is the unspoken thought. Penn developed The Pledge for a year before Warner Bros was involved; he invested a substantial amount of his own cash. </p> <p>'So why not just go and play a spy for 10 million bucks?' </p> <p>'I'm too rich to justify that,' he says. 'I mean, I've been the starving artist as a young actor. And if something like that was offered at the time, you know - anything, a TV series - I would've fucking done it in a flash.' He laughs. 'But once you're able to get by and do what you do, I would recommend to myself or anybody else downsizing your life first. Because you gotta believe in it on some level, or don't take the dough.' </p> <p>But it's hard to downsize your life, even though fate may move it around on you. In 1996, soon after Penn and Robin Wright married, she was carjacked at gunpoint in the driveway of their Santa Monica home. The couple's two small children were in her Toyota Land Cruiser with her: Wright coolly negotiated with the carjackers to let the children go. She escaped unharmed; the crooks were apprehended. But that was it for LA. </p> <p>In short order, the Penns moved to Marin County and renovated a 6,000sq ft house to Sean's very specific specifications. The house already had a swimming pool and a tennis court. But, most important, he wanted a film-editing studio, and he wanted security. 'What I did is, I built a compound,' Penn says. 'I took every bit of money I've ever earned in my life, put it all into it. And I built a wall around it, and it's great. I mean, what I am is a parent in a small town.' </p> <p>Which is true, more or less. He's out of town a lot when he's working, but when he's around, he's around. What's he like as a dad? 'Direct, honest, loving,' his wife says. 'He's a softy with his girl. But he's a disciplinarian - thank God, cos I'm such a gimp in that department.' </p> <p>Robin Wright Penn compares his parenting to his moviemaking. 'You must teach and give examples to your offspring, as you would as a director,' she says. On his set, 'there's so much confidence in his quest, his vision. Usually there's so many filters running through a director - the studio, the producers, the crew. With his movies, it's Sean's show, always. It's very thought out - you never feel unsettled. It takes an enormous amount of stress to make him stressed, when you and I would be dying.' </p> <p>'I never saw Sean blow his top, ever,' says Aaron Eckhart, who plays Nicholson's former partner in The Pledge . 'He was always polite. There were some things where I thought, He's gonna lose his mind - we had a lot of weather problems. But he'd sit there, and say, \"What can I do?\" The quintessential captain of the ship.' </p> <p>Penn has brought me out to the marina where he keeps his real ship, a 34ft, twin-screw, white, aqua and purple speed demon, with a mean, rakish silhouette and a good, corny, poker-playing name on the transom - complete with a picture of a poker hand. He grins with raffish pride as he looks at it. 'I took my master sailing course this summer,' he tells me, 'and I have to say, what a bore ! It's all tacking, this way, that way. It's like golf .' He shakes his head. 'People say, \"Oh, it's so peaceful, so quiet.\" If I want quiet, this thing' - he nods at his boat - 'will go 45 knots. I can go to the middle of the bay and turn the engine off. It'll be quiet.' </p> <p>'Is that when you're most at peace?' I ask. 'Out in the bay?' </p> <p>'Nah. I don't know... you're asking me a very short time after I quit smoking.' He laughs. </p> <p>'You miss it, don't you,' I say. </p> <p>'I miss this.' He mimes a long, luxurious inhale. 'You know, look at me - I'm chewing on ice ! But I'm comfortable, I think. I'm basically not tortured right now.' </p> <p>He shakes his head. 'But I think sleep is a big waste of time.' He laughs. 'It's like school. I mean, when I'm not, like, building something - whether that's writing, or with my kids, teaching them how to do something, or making a movie, or whatever - when I'm not building something, and I'm not driving, and I'm not fucking' - another laugh - 'what am I doing? Unless I'm just hungover as a son of a bitch, then I can lay in a bed pretty good and do nothing, you know? Cigarettes were great for that. That's what they're for .' </p> <p>But cigarettes are history. His short temper is history. His outrage is another story. </p> <p>'Um, let's put it this way,' Penn says. 'I am not disturbed by Ronald Reagan's Alzheimer's.' He looks puckish. 'You know, there's not a lot of cleaner pictures of karma in the world. I mean, it's not a very Christian way of thinking - I do stray sometimes.' He laughs. 'But I go right from him mocking the farm worker and eating grapes on television during the boycott to him dribbling today. And I feel a sense of justice. </p> <p>'And I am sure that' - another laugh - 'I'll end up dribbling later on behalf of something I did, too.' </p> <p>I can't stop feeling intrigued by Penn's curious relationship with money. And so I call him one night a couple of weeks later to ask some rude questions. Is he making anything close to his full fee for his next acting gig, The Assassination of Richard Nixon? </p> <p>'That's an awfully darn good script with a first-time director,' he tells me. 'I'm not gonna be buying my house from that deal.' </p> <p>I ask what his director's fee was on The Pledge . 'It's hard to say, since it's been significantly compromised in an effort to get the nuts and bolts together,' he says. 'Look, if you start playing with the jingle in your own pocket, you better have a lot of jingle, which I don't, and it's best to play [after you've been paid], which I didn't.' </p> <p>There are children's voices and a small dog yapping in the background. </p> <p>'I've made less money than anybody who does what I do,' Sean Penn insists. 'Meaning, I think I do it pretty well and work pretty hard. Believe me, I'm not boasting when I say that - I'm smiling not to cry.' </p> <p>'But you live well,' I say, as gently as possible. </p> <p>He's cupping his hand over the phone to talk to somebody for a moment. Now he's back. 'I got a kid here who really wants to go for a bike ride,' he says. </p> <p>He is as happy as a miserable man can be.</p> <p> Sean Penn's The Pledge is showing at the Cannes Film Festival which starts this week</p>",

It was financed by an independent production company called Franchise Pictures, was budgeted at a relatively modest $30m - $10m of which goes to pay Nicholson's full fee - and was shot on a shoestring in Vancouver. 'It's a retirement-crisis story disguised as a thriller, let's put it that way,' the writer/director says. 'I didn't get the retirement-crisis story financed, if you know what I mean. But I got it shot.' He grins. Another quirky character study, in other words. But a quirky character study with a three-act structure and plot payoff at the end. Besides Nicholson and Wright, The Pledge also stars Vanessa Redgrave, Helen Mirren, Mickey Rourke, Harry Dean Stanton and Sam Shepard. Nevertheless, distinguished cast aside, Penn the filmmaker is realistic about the studio's involvement, and about why this might be his first project to win a wider audience. 'It's a very different kind of movie than my first two,' Penn says. 'I think everybody considers it much more accessible.' As always, however, Sean Penn has his own version of accessibility. There have always been demons. They were there before Penn fired a gun at press helicopters covering his 1986 wedding to Madonna; they were there before the many fist fights won and lost; they are, in the midst of his happiness, there still. Sunset: we're driving back from the Skywalker Ranch screening - two hours of dark and quirky doings among Orthodox Jews in Jerusalem, sort of a Sean Penn movie with yarmulkes. Penn is at the wheel of his black BMW, accelerating over back-country switchbacks in central Marin. He drives to relax, but he is not an especially relaxed driver. Seat-beltless, he leans over the steering wheel, his goatee jutting defiantly as he scans the road for enemies. Passing through a small town, we soon find ourselves behind one: a very slow Mercedes. 'Come on, sir,' he moans. ' Where is it you think you're not going ?' A long scar below his right eyebrow puts me in mind of a scene in The Crossing Guard in which Robin Wright asks ex-con David Morse about a similar scar on his forehead. Morse tells her he got it banging his head against the wall. 'You just couldn't stand jail?' Wright asks. 'No, I just couldn't stand me,' Morse says. Penn wrote the line. He is, by his own admission, 'a big drinker', even though the court-appointed psychotherapist he consulted after getting out of jail determined he was not an alcoholic. He tells a story against himself: during the earthquake that rattled the counties north of San Francisco in early September, 'I'd had a couple of drinks,' he says. 'I was in my editing room with some people, and suddenly everybody sat down. Fast. I thought that was odd.' He smiles. It is tempting to think of him as a perpetual rebel, an adolescent in arrest, rather than as a 40-year-old family man - husband to Robin Wright Penn, father to their nine-year-old daughter Dylan Frances and seven-year-old son Hopper Jack. But when I ask where he's headed this evening, he says, 'I'm gonna go home and read to my kids. I tried Harry Potter, but it didn't take. Plus it was too hard to act, doing all those voices.' It's tempting to remember all the bad behaviour, the indelible template laid down in Fast Times at Ridgemont High and Bad Boys and Racing With the Moon and The Falcon and the Snowman - the remote, sneering, mesmerising man-boy with the little, close-set eyes. 'So how was turning 40?' I ask him. He laughs a little. 'Yeah-how about that?' he says. 'How'd it hit you?' 'Well, it was a disaster,' he says. 'I had always told myself that I really should quit smoking at 30. OK, 35. Always, 40 was: there's no choice any more, you just have to do it.' 'Why?' 'It was time not to be a slave to this nonsense, you know? I mean, if I could smoke eight cigarettes a day, I'd smoke the rest of my life. But it's worse than that with me. I smoke four packs like that .' I ask if the birthday itself, as a landmark, was difficult. He shakes his head. 'I don't really have a thing about that,' he says. 'I'll go 50, 60 - I don't care. This is not an area of my girlie sensibility. You know, there's that thing: what age do you see yourself as? Always felt I'm more like 76. That's when I'll say, \"Oh finally!\" I'll feel old at 77.' He hasn't plucked that number out of nowhere. Penn's father, the director (and actor) Leo Penn, died at 77 - of lung cancer - two years ago. Sean, who was in the midst of shooting Woody Allen's Sweet and Lowdown in New York as his father was dying, flew back to LA every few days to be with him. 'I thought when he lost his dad, it humbled him,' Robin Wright Penn says. 'It took the edge off a little bit.' Leo Penn's acting career ended in the early 50s when he refused to name names before the House Un-American Activities Committee and was branded a Communist. Blacklisted in the movie business, he turned to television directing. One of Sean Penn's boyhood memories is watching Elia Kazan - who did name names - shoot The Last Tycoon near the Penn family home in Malibu. One day Leo Penn walked his son down to see the set. 'My dad was a very warm, polite person, and Kazan said hello to him, and [Dad] just walked by,' he remembers. His father's example - in every way - left a strong stamp on Penn. Trying to move from acting to directing is just the start. It's too easy to write off Penn as a self-important punk without tracking the source of his demons. Hollywood is in his blood (his mother Eileen Ryan and his younger brother Christopher are both actors), and he's furious with Hollywood. 'It just makes you angry, the idea that a guy that goes off, fights for his country, wins all kinds of medals by risking his life, and then four years later, the country says, \"You can't work here,\"' he says. 'And I am a total believer in: it can happen again. There's signs of it all the time. The one thing you can count on in Hollywood - across the board - is cowardice.' 'The thing that makes Sean special in Hollywood is that it takes great courage to do it on your terms, knowing you may not please the 10 guys in town that green-light pictures,' says Art Linson, who got to know Penn when he produced Fast Times and has remained his close friend for almost 20 years. 'He's not going to put out silly, likable movies so an executive at a studio will say, \"Way to go, guy - let's have dinner.\" That takes balls. Few people in this town have the courage to be good.' Linson is talking about both Penn's acting and his filmmaking. But none of this explains why he's always threatening to quit acting - as if it were cigarettes - when he's so brilliant at it. 'Well, I don't like it,' Penn says. 'Sometimes maybe for a week or two I like it. But there's no comparison to being able to go out and make your movie as a director. It's already a crapshoot that it's something you're interested in - that it relates to what you want to create at all. It's somebody else's trip. And then you add your bit to it. It's a great craft, it's a great interpretive art, and I'm a fan of it, but it doesn't fill any kind of need to work; it certainly hasn't filled my bank account. I just want real creative freedom without worrying about, you know, car payments.' It's strange: his anger seems more abstract than it once was. I had expected - well, one actor who worked with him asked me, half jokingly, 'Has he punched you in the mouth yet?' It's something that's in the back of your mind when you sit down with Sean Penn. But it's hard to find the hot buttons; he's looser about himself than I thought he'd be. 'What do people get wrong when they write about you?' I ask. 'I usually read pieces about me and respond, \"That sounds like the last one,\"' he says. 'It's because I get off on the same thing every time, and it's redundant.' He laughs. 'I mean, it'd be more interesting to go on a fact-finding mission. Just pick the front page of the New York Times, and hop in a car, and let's really search it down. See who's fuckin' lying.' He did something very much like this recently, he tells me, mentioning a trip he took to Selma, Alabama, with a former Black Panther named Geronimo Pratt to encourage citizens to vote in the city's mayoral election. This is mildly astonishing: I hadn't heard that Penn had done any such thing. But shouldn't I have heard? Don't celebrities always make sure they make the news for their good works? There is no mention of Penn's trip on any newspaper or wire- service database: strangely enough, he went solely for the purpose of going. 'Isn't there a potential downside in making a trip like that for somebody like you?' I ask. 'What's the downside?' 'Being perceived as a limousine liberal?' 'I am a limousine liberal,' he says. He stops the car outside my hotel. 'Look,' he says. 'You don't have to think the world of yourself or be a great activist to do anything like that. I mean, I'm not gonna avoid idiotic comments people want to make just because you try to do something good.' Sean Penn is trying to do something good. He's not trying to get more famous, or very rich - though he certainly wouldn't mind making enough money to stop doing the very thing we want him to continue doing. ('Give me one cheque,' he says. 'Get rid of the acting; just make movies. Just that one cheque.') Look at the pictures he's done over the past five years: Sweet and Lowdown . The Weight of Water . Up at the Villa . Hurlyburly . The Thin Red Line . She's So Lovely . Dead Man Walking . He has frequently been magnificent. He has seldom been paid in kind. For Sweet and Lowdown , he earned scale (a little more than $2,000 a week), like all actors in Woody Allen films. For Hurlyburly , he made a reported $150,000. For The Thin Red Line , he was reportedly paid $300,000, though his deal included back-end points should the picture earn money. (It didn't.) For well-distributed independent pictures such as The Weight of Water, he earns in the low millions - a quarter of what the blockbusters he regularly turns down pay. He shrugs. 'I go broke all the time,' he says. 'I can't do what I've been doing - I keep doing projects, and not getting paid for them as an actor, and then I go out as a director...' He trails off. And make even less is the unspoken thought. Penn developed The Pledge for a year before Warner Bros was involved; he invested a substantial amount of his own cash. 'So why not just go and play a spy for 10 million bucks?' 'I'm too rich to justify that,' he says. 'I mean, I've been the starving artist as a young actor. And if something like that was offered at the time, you know - anything, a TV series - I would've fucking done it in a flash.' He laughs. 'But once you're able to get by and do what you do, I would recommend to myself or anybody else downsizing your life first. Because you gotta believe in it on some level, or don't take the dough.' But it's hard to downsize your life, even though fate may move it around on you. In 1996, soon after Penn and Robin Wright married, she was carjacked at gunpoint in the driveway of their Santa Monica home. The couple's two small children were in her Toyota Land Cruiser with her: Wright coolly negotiated with the carjackers to let the children go. She escaped unharmed; the crooks were apprehended. But that was it for LA. In short order, the Penns moved to Marin County and renovated a 6,000sq ft house to Sean's very specific specifications. The house already had a swimming pool and a tennis court. But, most important, he wanted a film-editing studio, and he wanted security. 'What I did is, I built a compound,' Penn says. 'I took every bit of money I've ever earned in my life, put it all into it. And I built a wall around it, and it's great. I mean, what I am is a parent in a small town.' Which is true, more or less. He's out of town a lot when he's working, but when he's around, he's around. What's he like as a dad? 'Direct, honest, loving,' his wife says. 'He's a softy with his girl. But he's a disciplinarian - thank God, cos I'm such a gimp in that department.' Robin Wright Penn compares his parenting to his moviemaking. 'You must teach and give examples to your offspring, as you would as a director,' she says. On his set, 'there's so much confidence in his quest, his vision. Usually there's so many filters running through a director - the studio, the producers, the crew. With his movies, it's Sean's show, always. It's very thought out - you never feel unsettled. It takes an enormous amount of stress to make him stressed, when you and I would be dying.' 'I never saw Sean blow his top, ever,' says Aaron Eckhart, who plays Nicholson's former partner in The Pledge . 'He was always polite. There were some things where I thought, He's gonna lose his mind - we had a lot of weather problems. But he'd sit there, and say, \"What can I do?\" The quintessential captain of the ship.' Penn has brought me out to the marina where he keeps his real ship, a 34ft, twin-screw, white, aqua and purple speed demon, with a mean, rakish silhouette and a good, corny, poker-playing name on the transom - complete with a picture of a poker hand. He grins with raffish pride as he looks at it. 'I took my master sailing course this summer,' he tells me, 'and I have to say, what a bore ! It's all tacking, this way, that way. It's like golf .' He shakes his head. 'People say, \"Oh, it's so peaceful, so quiet.\" If I want quiet, this thing' - he nods at his boat - 'will go 45 knots. I can go to the middle of the bay and turn the engine off. It'll be quiet.' 'Is that when you're most at peace?' I ask. 'Out in the bay?' 'Nah. I don't know... you're asking me a very short time after I quit smoking.' He laughs. 'You miss it, don't you,' I say. 'I miss this.' He mimes a long, luxurious inhale. 'You know, look at me - I'm chewing on ice ! But I'm comfortable, I think. I'm basically not tortured right now.' He shakes his head. 'But I think sleep is a big waste of time.' He laughs. 'It's like school. I mean, when I'm not, like, building something - whether that's writing, or with my kids, teaching them how to do something, or making a movie, or whatever - when I'm not building something, and I'm not driving, and I'm not fucking' - another laugh - 'what am I doing? Unless I'm just hungover as a son of a bitch, then I can lay in a bed pretty good and do nothing, you know? Cigarettes were great for that. That's what they're for .' But cigarettes are history. His short temper is history. His outrage is another story. 'Um, let's put it this way,' Penn says. 'I am not disturbed by Ronald Reagan's Alzheimer's.' He looks puckish. 'You know, there's not a lot of cleaner pictures of karma in the world. I mean, it's not a very Christian way of thinking - I do stray sometimes.' He laughs. 'But I go right from him mocking the farm worker and eating grapes on television during the boycott to him dribbling today. And I feel a sense of justice. 'And I am sure that' - another laugh - 'I'll end up dribbling later on behalf of something I did, too.' I can't stop feeling intrigued by Penn's curious relationship with money. And so I call him one night a couple of weeks later to ask some rude questions. Is he making anything close to his full fee for his next acting gig, The Assassination of Richard Nixon? 'That's an awfully darn good script with a first-time director,' he tells me. 'I'm not gonna be buying my house from that deal.' I ask what his director's fee was on The Pledge . 'It's hard to say, since it's been significantly compromised in an effort to get the nuts and bolts together,' he says. 'Look, if you start playing with the jingle in your own pocket, you better have a lot of jingle, which I don't, and it's best to play [after you've been paid], which I didn't.' There are children's voices and a small dog yapping in the background. 'I've made less money than anybody who does what I do,' Sean Penn insists. 'Meaning, I think I do it pretty well and work pretty hard. Believe me, I'm not boasting when I say that - I'm smiling not to cry.' 'But you live well,' I say, as gently as possible. He's cupping his hand over the phone to talk to somebody for a moment. Now he's back. 'I got a kid here who really wants to go for a bike ride,' he says. He is as happy as a miserable man can be. Sean Penn's The Pledge is showing at the Cannes Film Festival which starts this week",

      "body": "<p>How satisfying to stand on the moral high-ground and watch those terrible Tories turn the air blue with their racist insults: John Townend with his slur about a mongrel race; Sir Richard Body calling his book England for the English; and Willy Hague exposed by Lord Taylor - one of his very own - as a weakling unable to replace the lid on the Pandora's box of Conservative bigotry.</p> <p>Up in north London, chattering-class liberals rub their hands with glee: oh what a sorry spectacle those Conservatives make, how superior we all are. The word 'mongrel' - or 'nigger', or 'darkie' - would never pass our lips, no-one would ever be turned away from our home or business because of their colour.</p> <p>But liberal tolerance is only skin deep: when it comes to the belief system that most blacks and Asians in this country subscribe to, the bien pensants prove as prejudiced as John Townend, Lord Tebbit and Ian Paisley rolled into one. Anti-Islam is the acceptable face of racism; to give a Muslim a hard time about her faith is kosher, in a way that so much as to notice her different hue is not. Listen to the bastions of liberal Britain: Polly Toynbee, 'I am an Islamophobe'; Linda Grant, 'I am pretty Islamophobic myself'; and Andrew Marr, who in this very paper wrote of a 'thick impenetrable bubble' that separated a serious Muslim from 'planet Marr'.</p> <p>Racist sentiments all. For religion is, according to Bhikhu Parekh, who chaired the Commission on the Future of Multi-ethnic Britain, a fundamental component of ethnicity; an attack on its beliefs and practices constitutes racism, he writes in Integrating Minorities (published by the ICA). In other words, spitting at someone because she's wearing a head-scarf is the same as spitting at someone because she looks Asian.</p> <p>To attack other religions that ethnic minorities belong to - Hinduism and the Afro-Caribbean churches - would prove equally racist. But where Islam earns vicious words from the liberals, Hinduism with its gawdy elephant gods and the Afro-Caribbean churches with their happy-clappy guitar strumming, get away with a smirk of condescension.</p> <p>This scapegoating of Muslims prompted the 1997 Runnymede report to recommend that Britain broaden its anti-racist agenda to include a campaign against Islamophobia. That report called for a ban on religious discrimination - but in the well-protected avenues where the liberal consensus flourishes, the call fell on deaf ears.

      "bodyText": "How satisfying to stand on the moral high-ground and watch those terrible Tories turn the air blue with their racist insults: John Townend with his slur about a mongrel race; Sir Richard Body calling his book England for the English; and Willy Hague exposed by Lord Taylor - one of his very own - as a weakling unable to replace the lid on the Pandora's box of Conservative bigotry. Up in north London, chattering-class liberals rub their hands with glee: oh what a sorry spectacle those Conservatives make, how superior we all are. The word 'mongrel' - or 'nigger', or 'darkie' - would never pass our lips, no-one would ever be turned away from our home or business because of their colour. But liberal tolerance is only skin deep: when it comes to the belief system that most blacks and Asians in this country subscribe to, the bien pensants prove as prejudiced as John Townend, Lord Tebbit and Ian Paisley rolled into one. Anti-Islam is the acceptable face of racism; to give a Muslim a hard time about her faith is kosher, in a way that so much as to notice her different hue is not. Listen to the bastions of liberal Britain: Polly Toynbee, 'I am an Islamophobe'; Linda Grant, 'I am pretty Islamophobic myself'; and Andrew Marr, who in this very paper wrote of a 'thick impenetrable bubble' that separated a serious Muslim from 'planet Marr'. Racist sentiments all. For religion is, according to Bhikhu Parekh, who chaired the Commission on the Future of Multi-ethnic Britain, a fundamental component of ethnicity; an attack on its beliefs and practices constitutes racism, he writes in Integrating Minorities (published by the ICA). In other words, spitting at someone because she's wearing a head-scarf is the same as spitting at someone because she looks Asian. To attack other religions that ethnic minorities belong to - Hinduism and the Afro-Caribbean churches - would prove equally racist. But where Islam earns vicious words from the liberals, Hinduism with its gawdy elephant gods and the Afro-Caribbean churches with their happy-clappy guitar strumming, get away with a smirk of condescension. This scapegoating of Muslims prompted the 1997 Runnymede report to recommend that Britain broaden its anti-racist agenda to include a campaign against Islamophobia. That report called for a ban on religious discrimination - but in the well-protected avenues where the liberal consensus flourishes, the call fell on deaf ears. These liberals defend their anti-Muslim rants by pointing out that they are equally happy to discriminate against all religions. As if their anti-Christianity offers comfort to Muslims. No Muslim (or Christian, Hindu, or Jew) accepts this: religious discrimination, even when not rooted in racism, betrays medieval intolerance of the sort that fuelled the Inquisition and the trials of witches. It is fanned by a near-universal ignorance of the world of religion - any religion; and this ignorance forms the well-spring of fear. The notion of a spiritual authority that commands unswerving allegiance sends shivers down the secular spine. No atheist can understand that an attack on the god you love is as devastating as an attack on the name you bear or the pigmentation you have - indeed, more so: your faith informs what you think, do, wear and say, far more than being black or being called Patel does. Westerners mask their prejudice behind liberal posturing: in Muslim countries, they claim, women are not equal to men.

The fifth round of the championship turned out to be a race for the lame, Michael Schumacher taking victory on the final lap as he nursed his Ferrari past the smoking remains of Mika Hakkinen's McLaren-Mercedes. </p> <p>Neither team can confirm or deny that their various woes were associated with the hazards of venturing 200 racing miles into unfamiliar technical territory. Schumacher was forced to slow by a vibration which came from a tyre turning on its rim. This sort of thing has happened before although, significantly perhaps, not on the first two sets of tyres used by Schumacher as he led the race before his second and final pit stop. </p> <p>Ferrari has sent wheels and tyres back to Bridgestone for analysis in Japan. It remains to be seen if the effects of improved traction out of the corners contributed to the rubber shifting slightly on the rim and putting the wheel out of balance. </p> <p>Schumacher was lucky to have almost a minute in hand over Juan Pablo Montoya's Williams-BMW, but nothing would match the good fortune associated with finding the parked McLaren less than a mile from home. It is difficult to say whether or not Schumacher would have beaten Hakkinen had the vibration problem not intervened - Ferrari technical director Ross Brawn says it was too close to call - but McLaren appeared to have marginally the better pitstop strategy, one which allowed Hakkinen to take the lead at a crucial moment. All of which, of course, made his late retirement even more difficult to bear. </p> <p>The engine manufacturers had warned that the effects of eliminating wheelspin through traction control could have a dire effect on the rest of the car. With 800 bhp looking for continual release, the consequences of abruptly cutting that power, even for a nanosecond, could send vibrations through the transmission, all the way back to the gearbox - and ultimately to the list of retirements. </p> <p>Another branch of electronic wizardry almost denied David Coulthard from putting that to the test when the launch control refused to operate properly as he prepared to commence the final parade lap before the start. </p> <p>Despite the rather gauche suggestion by McLaren boss Ron Dennis that the Scotsman had failed to engage his brain, the more tactful answer seems to be that there was fault on both sides but that, ultimately, the system should have coped with a misunderstanding which saw the driver fail to apply the required amount of revs. </p> <p>The irony is that, a first corner collision notwithstanding, Coulthard's car performed faultlessly thereafter and he picked up an extra championship point thanks to his team-mate's heartbreaking demise. On the other hand, had Schumacher not received the last-lap bonus and remained in second place, his lead over Coulthard would be five points instead of eight as they go to Austria for the sixth round next weekend. </p> <p>Peering through the smokescreen created - literally, in Hakkinen's case - by these supposed advances in motor racing science, it was easy to see that the old firm of McLaren and Ferrari had remained at the front. The one disappointment was a failure by Williams-BMW to follow on from their win two weeks before in Italy. Dr Mario Theissen, BMW's motorsport director, explained that each race is a separate entity; while they got their sums absolutely right in Imola, the mathematics might not add up elsewhere. </p> <p>Even so, a significant signal from Barcelona was that Michelin, the Williams tyre supplier, are some way behind Bridgestone (who support Ferrari and McLaren) despite the Spanish circuit being the first venue used this year on which the French tyre company has extensive testing knowledge. </p> <p>It's true that the unseasonably low temperatures did not help Michelin. In which case, old-fashioned weather in the Austrian mountains may hinder their runners next weekend. Provided modern technology doesn't have its say first, of course. </p> <p><strong>Drivers championship</strong></p> <p>1<strong> M Schumacher </strong> (Ferrari) 36 </p> <p>2<strong> D Coulthard </strong> (McLaren) 28 </p> <p>3<strong> R Barrichello </strong> (Ferrari) 14 </p> <p>4<strong> R Schumacher </strong> (Williams) 10 </p> <p>5<strong> N Heidfeld </strong> (Sauber) 8 </p> <p>6<strong> J Trulli </strong> (Jordan) 7 </p> <p>7=<strong> JP Montoya </strong> (Williams) 6 </p> <p> <strong>H-H Frentzen </strong> (Jordan) 6</p> <p>9=<strong> J Villeneuve </strong> (BAR) 4 </p> <p> <strong>M Hakkinen </strong> (McLaren) 4</p> <p>11<strong> O Panis </strong> (BAR) 3 </p> <p>12=<strong> K Raikkonen </strong> (Sauber) 1 </p> <p> <strong>G Fisichella </strong> (Williams) 1 </p> <p>Next race: 13 May, Austria</p>",

With 800 bhp looking for continual release, the consequences of abruptly cutting that power, even for a nanosecond, could send vibrations through the transmission, all the way back to the gearbox - and ultimately to the list of retirements. Another branch of electronic wizardry almost denied David Coulthard from putting that to the test when the launch control refused to operate properly as he prepared to commence the final parade lap before the start. Despite the rather gauche suggestion by McLaren boss Ron Dennis that the Scotsman had failed to engage his brain, the more tactful answer seems to be that there was fault on both sides but that, ultimately, the system should have coped with a misunderstanding which saw the driver fail to apply the required amount of revs. The irony is that, a first corner collision notwithstanding, Coulthard's car performed faultlessly thereafter and he picked up an extra championship point thanks to his team-mate's heartbreaking demise. On the other hand, had Schumacher not received the last-lap bonus and remained in second place, his lead over Coulthard would be five points instead of eight as they go to Austria for the sixth round next weekend. Peering through the smokescreen created - literally, in Hakkinen's case - by these supposed advances in motor racing science, it was easy to see that the old firm of McLaren and Ferrari had remained at the front. The one disappointment was a failure by Williams-BMW to follow on from their win two weeks before in Italy. Dr Mario Theissen, BMW's motorsport director, explained that each race is a separate entity; while they got their sums absolutely right in Imola, the mathematics might not add up elsewhere. Even so, a significant signal from Barcelona was that Michelin, the Williams tyre supplier, are some way behind Bridgestone (who support Ferrari and McLaren) despite the Spanish circuit being the first venue used this year on which the French tyre company has extensive testing knowledge. It's true that the unseasonably low temperatures did not help Michelin. In which case, old-fashioned weather in the Austrian mountains may hinder their runners next weekend. Provided modern technology doesn't have its say first, of course.

      "body": "<p>When Sir Michael Stoute says 'this colt is a very exciting prospect', immediately after it has won a Classic race, hairs rise on the neck. A cold, wet spring on Newmarket Heath has left the younger horses backward, and in the few weeks running up to the Derby some are sure to improve dramatically. Among them will be Golan, winner of the 2,000 Guineas, and now a hot favourite for the Classic at Epsom next month. </p> <p>Like King's Best a year ago, Golan is trained by Stoute and ridden by Kieren Fallon. Then the jockey had come from last to first, and Golan achieved a similar victory. Drawn widest of the 18 runners, he was driven to move into the lead with less than two furlongs to run and stayed on well to resist Tamburlaine's persistent challenge. </p> <p>'You won't often see a horse win a Classic like that, coming from last to first to win the way he did,' was the jockey's post-race observation. 'You might be able to do it in a handicap, but to do it in a Classic is remarkable.' Reading into the reactions of two such conservative opinions, Golan could be something special. This was Stoute's fifth 2,000 Guineas success and his enthusiasm for the winner was unconcealed. </p> <p>The trainer's luck has been wretched in the first weeks of the season, but in his own words he has been careful with his horses. Golan is sure to improve for the race, only the second of his career. In his first at Chepstow last autumn he beat Clearing, who has a good chance in the French 2,000 Guineas on Sunday. </p> <p>Fallon, too, has made a tardy start, taking time to reach full strength after his left shoulder was wrenched apart in a fall at Royal Ascot. He asserted recently that he would retain his jockeys' championship, barring injury. It was a bold statement, but his faith has never wavered and this victory was surely a vindication of his confidence. </p> <p>Not surprisingly, Golan heads the market for the Derby, a best-priced 5-2 with Ladbrokes, Victor Chandler and Paddy Power. Galileo is second favourite, generally at 7-1, and looking through the remaining aspirants, Stoute trains two of the most promising, Dilshaan, who outstayed Tamburlaine in the Racing Post Trophy, and Dawari, whose merit will be tested in the Chester Vase on Tuesday. </p> <p>Those apart, John Dunlop's Olden Times, a winner here at the Craven meeting, had the form of his victory franked by the success of Terrestrial in the first race yesterday, and Hemingway's success at York last year stays in the mind. They still have something to prove; Golan's performance in the 2,000 Guineas was an outstanding trial for the Derby, and odds of 5-2 might seem generous on 9 June. </p> <p>Many winners of the Newmarket Classic have failed at Epsom; either the undulating course or the greater test of stamina exposes their inadequacies. Golan should handle the track, and there is every chance he will get a mile and a half. He is by Spectrum, who won the Champion Stakes over a mile and a quarter, out of a Generous mare. He promises to stay. </p> <p>Stoute paid a compliment to Roy Carter, who has ridden Golan during the winter, and to Fallon, who has been on board for the colt's recent fast work. They have educated Golan to overcome his relative lack of experience and further progress seems inevitable. </p> <p>Another aspect of Golan's character that surely bodes well is his attitude. 'Sometimes this horse is so laid back that he has given us a scare once or twice, but going into the race I was very happy with him. He has a marvellous temperament,' the trainer said. </p> <p>The Ruinart Champagne Conditions Stakes gave no clue to Epsom. Terrestrial beat Prize Winner, the pair finishing clear, but neither holds an entry for the Derby. John Gosden's progressive winner could be supplemented for \u00a375,000, but the Prix du Jockey Club is the preferred option. </p> <p>'The French Derby has been the plan for some time,' he said. 'He is a good worker at home and I think we can do enough with him there. Manton has a big, right-handed bend and that will be helpful with Chantilly in mind.' </p> <p>The ground might be too fast for Gosden's Crystal Music in the 1,000 Guineas today. Stoute and Fallon will be responsible for the favourite, Karasta, but the Aga Khan's filly was slightly disappointing when beaten at Longchamp on Arc day, and her odds are no longer attractive. </p> <p>Godolphin's Muwakleh has been impressive in two races on the sand at Nad Al Sheba, but how she will cope with the Rowley Mile can be only a guess and Toroca will be better value. Runner-up to Regal Rose in the Cheveley Park Stakes, Aidan O'Brien's filly won comfortably on her reappearance, and has an each-way chance in an open race.</p>",

The trainer's luck has been wretched in the first weeks of the season, but in his own words he has been careful with his horses. Golan is sure to improve for the race, only the second of his career. In his first at Chepstow last autumn he beat Clearing, who has a good chance in the French 2,000 Guineas on Sunday. Fallon, too, has made a tardy start, taking time to reach full strength after his left shoulder was wrenched apart in a fall at Royal Ascot. He asserted recently that he would retain his jockeys' championship, barring injury. It was a bold statement, but his faith has never wavered and this victory was surely a vindication of his confidence. Not surprisingly, Golan heads the market for the Derby, a best-priced 5-2 with Ladbrokes, Victor Chandler and Paddy Power. Galileo is second favourite, generally at 7-1, and looking through the remaining aspirants, Stoute trains two of the most promising, Dilshaan, who outstayed Tamburlaine in the Racing Post Trophy, and Dawari, whose merit will be tested in the Chester Vase on Tuesday. Those apart, John Dunlop's Olden Times, a winner here at the Craven meeting, had the form of his victory franked by the success of Terrestrial in the first race yesterday, and Hemingway's success at York last year stays in the mind. They still have something to prove; Golan's performance in the 2,000 Guineas was an outstanding trial for the Derby, and odds of 5-2 might seem generous on 9 June. Many winners of the Newmarket Classic have failed at Epsom; either the undulating course or the greater test of stamina exposes their inadequacies. Golan should handle the track, and there is every chance he will get a mile and a half. He is by Spectrum, who won the Champion Stakes over a mile and a quarter, out of a Generous mare. He promises to stay. Stoute paid a compliment to Roy Carter, who has ridden Golan during the winter, and to Fallon, who has been on board for the colt's recent fast work. They have educated Golan to overcome his relative lack of experience and further progress seems inevitable. Another aspect of Golan's character that surely bodes well is his attitude. 'Sometimes this horse is so laid back that he has given us a scare once or twice, but going into the race I was very happy with him. He has a marvellous temperament,' the trainer said. The Ruinart Champagne Conditions Stakes gave no clue to Epsom. Terrestrial beat Prize Winner, the pair finishing clear, but neither holds an entry for the Derby. John Gosden's progressive winner could be supplemented for \u00a375,000, but the Prix du Jockey Club is the preferred option. 'The French Derby has been the plan for some time,' he said. 'He is a good worker at home and I think we can do enough with him there. Manton has a big, right-handed bend and that will be helpful with Chantilly in mind.' The ground might be too fast for Gosden's Crystal Music in the 1,000 Guineas today. Stoute and Fallon will be responsible for the favourite, Karasta, but the Aga Khan's filly was slightly disappointing when beaten at Longchamp on Arc day, and her odds are no longer attractive. Godolphin's Muwakleh has been impressive in two races on the sand at Nad Al Sheba, but how she will cope with the Rowley Mile can be only a guess and Toroca will be better value. Runner-up to Regal Rose in the Cheveley Park Stakes, Aidan O'Brien's filly won comfortably on her reappearance, and has an each-way chance in an open race.",

This week the Showcase tipping competition for the press was postponed until further notice. Newbury up for the Cup The disclosure of Newbury's plans for a \u00a32.5m all-weather course means the proposed London track at Fairlop Waters and now the Berkshire track both clearly harbour plans to stage Europe's answer to the Breeders' Cup. Poor excuses for losers Racing's governing bodies in other parts of the globe don't believe punters, who fund the sport to a great extent, should put up with nonsense we have seen in this part of the world of late. Our enquiries of the racing authorities in South Africa this week have confirmed that they would have had called in the connections of Arc runner-up Egyptband, who finished second in the prestigious Prix Ganay at Longchamp last Sunday after his trainer's assistant had said before the event that the jockey 'would not give her a hard race'. There is no doubt they would have meted out a more severe ban to jockey Lee Newman than the 14 days he got from the stewards at Bath on Tuesday following his defeat on the gambled-on Lady Two K in a race the young jockey (below) would certainly have won if he had not taken it easy in the closing stages. The riding of Lady Two K predictably attracted plenty of publicity in the racing pages in the papers and this will no doubt affect her odds in a handicap in the near future, but the mare has improved since being stepped up in distance and she should win more races this season. Why Chester's such a big draw Chester takes centre stage this week and when the spotlight falls on Britain's tightest racecourse the talk on the TV (all three days are covered on Channel 4) and in the betting shops often revolves around the draw, particularly in the races over shorter trips. But the popular racetrack is not the only British course where a horse's stalls number is vital and the draw is such an important factor that punters armed with the details of where the bias lies can definitely gain an edge. Graham Wheldon, perhaps the leading exponent of draw analysis in this country, opened his ground-breaking tome The Effects Of The Draw two years ago with the words: 'On many British racecourses, the draw has more influence on the outcome of the races than any other single factor'. Both that book and his updated volume, Backing The Draw For Profit, have sold out but Wheldon started a new column called Sprintline in the Racing &amp; Football Outlook this week which seems sure to prove required reading for those seeking to profit from his knowledge. Another book worth seeking out is Bias 2001 by David Renham which not only gives a detailed draw bias course-by-course analysis but includes perhaps the punter's Holy Grail, a winning system that Renham devised around draw bias which has recorded five winning years in a row.

      "body": "<p>With Alec Stewart and Mark Ramprakash in firm command of Essex's attack, Surrey, set a target of 223, were well on course to achieve a win that would almost ensure them a place in the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup quarter-finals. Stewart, playing his first innings of the season, was in excellent fettle and Ramprakash positively imperious. They took Surrey past 100 in the 22nd over. </p> <p>Essex, who needed to win this match to figure in the knock-out stage, must have been pleasantly surprised to be batting on a firm pitch with a nice carry and would have aspired to a bigger score than they achieved. Darren Robinson, who had scored a good 69 against Kent on Friday, was out in the first over, attempting a suicidal single. But that blow was softened by Nasser Hussain and Stuart Law putting on 109 for the second wicket. </p> <p>Surrey's bowlers were tidy, as they had to be to prevent exploitation of the short boundary on the gasometer side. But the few loose balls were firmly put away by Hussain and Law. The Australian, who hit six fours in his 55, fairly sparkled, as he always does when he is on song. His innings came to an inglorious end, however - caught pulling at a Ian Salisbury long hop. </p> <p>If Hussain was disappointed to be dismissed in the manner he was, caught behind trying to glance, he must have been delighted with his touch. A particularly stirring shot was a straight six he hit off a quite respectable ball from Martin Bicknell. Hussain had also made a half-century against Kent, but without being so delightfully relaxed and fluent as he was yesterday. His 63 made off 104 balls, was his highest score on home soil since his century against Nottinghamshire in the final match of the 1999 season. </p> <p>Wickets, from Essex's point of view, began to fall with disconcerting frequency after Hussain's exit in the 34th over.

      "bodyText": "With Alec Stewart and Mark Ramprakash in firm command of Essex's attack, Surrey, set a target of 223, were well on course to achieve a win that would almost ensure them a place in the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup quarter-finals. Stewart, playing his first innings of the season, was in excellent fettle and Ramprakash positively imperious. They took Surrey past 100 in the 22nd over. Essex, who needed to win this match to figure in the knock-out stage, must have been pleasantly surprised to be batting on a firm pitch with a nice carry and would have aspired to a bigger score than they achieved. Darren Robinson, who had scored a good 69 against Kent on Friday, was out in the first over, attempting a suicidal single. But that blow was softened by Nasser Hussain and Stuart Law putting on 109 for the second wicket. Surrey's bowlers were tidy, as they had to be to prevent exploitation of the short boundary on the gasometer side. But the few loose balls were firmly put away by Hussain and Law. The Australian, who hit six fours in his 55, fairly sparkled, as he always does when he is on song. His innings came to an inglorious end, however - caught pulling at a Ian Salisbury long hop. If Hussain was disappointed to be dismissed in the manner he was, caught behind trying to glance, he must have been delighted with his touch. A particularly stirring shot was a straight six he hit off a quite respectable ball from Martin Bicknell. Hussain had also made a half-century against Kent, but without being so delightfully relaxed and fluent as he was yesterday. His 63 made off 104 balls, was his highest score on home soil since his century against Nottinghamshire in the final match of the 1999 season. Wickets, from Essex's point of view, began to fall with disconcerting frequency after Hussain's exit in the 34th over. Stephen Peters disappointed again, holing out to short midwicket in the 38th. Ronnie Irani, who had conjured 21 runs from 41 balls even though he was hard put to assert himself, was run out for no fault of his own. Then Graham Napier was caught on the midwicket boundary from a pull and Essex had lost three wickets in the space of six runs.

Australia are particularly blessed with Adam Gilchrist, who is perhaps the most exciting member of the side that will arrive here shortly to defend the Ashes. Gilchrist's first bad run of form with the bat in the recent Test series in India just happened to mark the end of Australia's record-breaking run of wins, which most believe was no mere coincidence. </p> <p>Bob Taylor, whose 57 Tests for England in the 1970s and 1980s were sullied by hardly an inelegant take or fluffed chance - the ball, the commentators liked to say, seemed to melt into his gloves - agrees that on current form the selectors will have little to choose from when Stewart goes. And it is not just the evidence of his own eyes that tells him this. 'I talk to the umpires as I go around the country,' he says. 'They see all the wicketkeepers in all the different conditions and situations, and they say that the cupboard's bare, that there's not the standard of wicketkeeping that there used to be.' </p> <p>Paul Nixon of Kent, Stewart's deputy on the winter tours of Pakistan and Sri Lanka, scores highly for commitment, personality and batting ability, but his keeping is not the most reliable; Chris Read of Nottinghamshire is generally reckoned to have been promoted too early to the Test side in 1999 and has been set back by the experience; and good keepers such as Worcestershire's Steve Rhodes, Karl Krikken of Derbyshire, Adrian Aymes of Hampshire and Warwickshire's Keith Piper are either too old or not strong enough batsmen - or both - to be chosen. </p> <p>All of which may turn the selectors in one of two other directions: persuading a batsman who has kept a bit to follow the Stewart route and become a specialist keeper (John Crawley and Marcus Trescothick are possible candidates here); or, which is more likely, talking Stewart into staying on until one of the younger keepers - of which the Durham University undergraduate James Foster of Essex, Sussex's Matt Prior and the Glamorgan reserve Mark Wallace are reckoned to be the pick - has proved himself. </p> <p>Taylor spells out the problems of trying to convert a batsman into a wicketkeeping all-rounder: 'Any competent catcher of the ball who is a first-class cricketer can put the gloves on and keep wicket standing back. It's when you get up to the stumps that really counts. John Crawley's done it and does well standing back, and also to a degree when standing up, but the concentration that's required in Test matches when there are long periods when little's happening is not easily acquired.' </p> <p>Peter Moores, the former Sussex wicketkeeper who is now that county's coach, is well placed to assess the young talent. He travelled with the England A side, who included the 21-year-old Foster, on their recent tour of the Caribbean. He also has first-hand knowledge of Prior, who is still only 19. 'James did very well on tour as a keeper and batsman,' says Moores, 'but it would be foolish to think of him as the finished article after only a handful of first-class games. What was impressive was that he improved all the time and I think his level of consistency will go up quite quickly when he starts playing regular first-team cricket.' </p> <p>Moores describes the South Africa-born Prior as a confident cricketer 'who backs himself to do well'. He is as much a batsman as a wicketkeeper and has already impressed in his one first-class innings this season. 'He's loving it, he's having a ball, as he should be doing at his age,' says Moores. 'Confidence is half the battle.' </p> <p>Quite why the supply line of international-class wicketkeepers has dried up is hard to tell. Taylor believes part of the problem is that England have produced so few bowling all-rounders that there has been more pressure on the wicketkeeper to score runs than was the case in his day. 'I was very fortunate in having Ian Botham around,' he says. 'Ian was the last of the bowling all-rounders. We know that the game has altered now, with wicketkeepers expected to contribute runs, but I was picked for England so many times because they knew they could rely on Ian to get wickets and runs. </p> <p>'We haven't really replaced Ian since he retired. Capel, Lewis, DeFreitas, Cork, Gough - they were all supposed to be able to bat and bowl, but none of them has managed it to the same degree as Ian.' </p> <p>And Taylor thinks that this pressure on wicketkeepers to be run-makers too has been detrimental. 'The expectation to perform in both departments is, it seems, proving too much.' </p> <p>Steve Marsh, the long-serving Kent keeper who has given way to Nixon, thinks developing wicketkeepers has been neglected. 'Perhaps in the past we were lucky and our Test wicketkeepers just came about through natural talent,' he says. 'Now we're finding out that not enough has been done to develop new ones, because there isn't anyone who stands out at the moment. </p> <p>'They'll have coaching seminars for batting, bowling and fielding, but keeping seems to be left out. The attitude is, \"Oh, it'll happen.\" But obviously it hasn't happened. It's an area that we have to look at.' </p> <p>For the moment, though, the selectors will be asking Alec Stewart not to stand too close to the heavy roller - or any other dangerous object.</p>",

What has changed is sheer length, and, to a lesser extent, ambition.</p> <p>Themes of betrayal and redemption run the length of the book, though they are disguised by a number of factors. One is that the incidents get less dramatic rather than more, as time goes by. So, in the 1980 section, one of the characters is sent to prison after an assault, though he is innocent. It also features a hideous set-piece, following a robbery in which two of the four principals are involved: their older companions torture and kill a pair of guard dogs, breaking the legs of one with boltcutters before burning them both. </p> <p>There's another robbery in the 1990 section, but this is in a lighter key, with two pairs of thieves converging on the same property. The main story of 2000 is comedy; an anorexic American superstar is coaxed on to the town by one of the boys, where she discovers a taste for curry and simple company. </p> <p>So the texture lightens, but not the tone. Consequences loom larger, shadows cast from the long ago, and there's little to contradict the proposition that: 'Ye eywis huv tae pey fir yir fun at some point, and, generally speakin, the mair ye party, the mair ye pey.' </p> <p>The 1970 prologue has done a certain amount of foreshadowing, showing us two functional fathers and two who are otherwise. The sons of the functionals, Carl Ewart and Billy Birrell, find their place in life; one as a DJ and the other briefly as a boxer, then as celebrity bar-owner, while the other two flounder: Andrew Galloway becomes a heroin addict, Terry Lawson a user of women. </p> <p>This is a culture where a teenager hesitates to smile at a girl he likes because: 'Ma mates might think ah'm a poof' and where the modest mousse-and-gel dandyism of a boxer in training prompts the reflection that 'sporty cunts are the biggest closet poofs under the sun'. Apparently, you can't have the grim humour and gutter poetry of dialect without its oppressiveness. </p> <p>In the 2000 section, Irvine Welsh belatedly introduces a couple of female points of view, except that these are ladettes, as stroppy and fixated as the lads. One of them is more than a match for the appalling Terry. There are disturbing signs at the end of this striking but confused and over-long book that the author, over and above his buried sentimental tenderness for the bond between male friends, is trying to turn Terry into an appealing character, someone you just can't blame for trying it on, like one of Martin Amis's louts of the life force.</p>",

It also features a hideous set-piece, following a robbery in which two of the four principals are involved: their older companions torture and kill a pair of guard dogs, breaking the legs of one with boltcutters before burning them both. There's another robbery in the 1990 section, but this is in a lighter key, with two pairs of thieves converging on the same property. The main story of 2000 is comedy; an anorexic American superstar is coaxed on to the town by one of the boys, where she discovers a taste for curry and simple company. So the texture lightens, but not the tone. Consequences loom larger, shadows cast from the long ago, and there's little to contradict the proposition that: 'Ye eywis huv tae pey fir yir fun at some point, and, generally speakin, the mair ye party, the mair ye pey.' The 1970 prologue has done a certain amount of foreshadowing, showing us two functional fathers and two who are otherwise. The sons of the functionals, Carl Ewart and Billy Birrell, find their place in life; one as a DJ and the other briefly as a boxer, then as celebrity bar-owner, while the other two flounder: Andrew Galloway becomes a heroin addict, Terry Lawson a user of women. This is a culture where a teenager hesitates to smile at a girl he likes because: 'Ma mates might think ah'm a poof' and where the modest mousse-and-gel dandyism of a boxer in training prompts the reflection that 'sporty cunts are the biggest closet poofs under the sun'. Apparently, you can't have the grim humour and gutter poetry of dialect without its oppressiveness. In the 2000 section, Irvine Welsh belatedly introduces a couple of female points of view, except that these are ladettes, as stroppy and fixated as the lads. One of them is more than a match for the appalling Terry. There are disturbing signs at the end of this striking but confused and over-long book that the author, over and above his buried sentimental tenderness for the bond between male friends, is trying to turn Terry into an appealing character, someone you just can't blame for trying it on, like one of Martin Amis's louts of the life force.",

It may even be the key to happiness. For while the rest of us wallow in the turbid waters of self-analysis, regret and doubt, the truly repressed scud by on an armoured craft of certainty: wise and faintly smug. </p> <p>Douglas Kennedy's Manhattan epic, The Pursuit of Happiness , has two narrators. The younger, Kate, is a modern woman who responds to heartbreak the modern way (whisky and sobbing). The elder, Sara, is not. Matter-of-factness personified, Sara maintains WASPish sang-froid even in the face of gore and torment. She may be the ideal companion in an air raid. Her suitability for a tale of death, passion and financial windfalls is another matter. </p> <p>Mysterious Sara first appears, an elegant Banquo, at the funeral of Kate's mother. She has a secret connection with Kate, and reveals it by giving her a manuscript: the central 400 pages of this novel. It is a story of the Forties and Fifties, of highballs and Remingtons, McCarthyism, civil obedience, and adultery, in this case with Jack, Kate's father, the tangled love of Sara's life. </p> <p>Like life, The Pursuit of Happiness is wildly unpredictable. This is its greatest strength. Kennedy is an agile storyteller who excels at surprises, and his characters have varied and exciting lives. It has all the ingredients of an outstanding page-turner - yet, it seems, Kennedy has other plans, and the result is less gripping, less moving and, frustratingly, less worthy of him than it might have been. </p> <p>Sara appears, with lengthy period scene-setting, at a point where our sympathy lies with Kate. Kate barely knew her father, and so sensible Sara's wartime romance with him is an unwelcome distraction. Unfortunately, for the next 200 pages, this is how Sara remains. She is not a sympathetic heroine. Her first ever story rivals Faulkner and Hemingway, her journalism is legendary, and she's the 'fastest wit in the West'. However, like her comedian brother, she is not actually funny. She is also fantastically repressed. She has lived, beneath the tweed, a racy life, but she is of her time, and 'back then, everyone did their best to avoid frank discussions about anything that was potentially painful'. This is not, thank God, the Fifties, and as jealousy and loss did exist we want to know how their participants felt, whether or not they acknowledged these feelings. However, despite her protestations of emotion, Sara's responses remain relentlessly prosaic. </p> <p>Even at its most dramatic, the novel is weirdly subdued by Kennedy's narrative technique. He favours wide-angled shots at moments of crisis, when Shaker-style dressers are more annoyance than helpful detail. Both Kate and Sara talk us through every mundane action, always making time to tip cab-drivers liberally before rushing off. Voiceover-style echoey flashbacks and emotional explication leave nothing to the imagination: 'You've never really figured me out, have you?' 'What I want to know, Charlie, is why?' '\"You what?\" I said, sounding shocked.' This, together with clunky period pointers - 'It was amazing what you could buy with $400 back then'- dubious comparisons of McCarthyism to the Holocaust, and anachronistic-sounding genetic determinism, leave the reader longing to be told less, and guess more. </p> <p>Despite occasional self-deprecating moments and dry asides, even Kennedy's most vivid characters have a slightly off-the-peg feel. Tough-talking wise-yet-sassy 'broads', Dorothy Parker-style editors and brothers who read quantum mechanics andplay 'a mean boogie-woogie piano' add little, and Sara unfortunately fails to see sense and marry her stevedore lawyer, her only chance for a life of love, self-knowledge and foreign food. </p> <p>As the lawyer explains, 'to move forward, we must_ come to terms with every damn thing that life throws in our path'. The same, unfortunately, can be said of this novel. Once the tragic revelations accelerate, Kennedy cannot help but write grippingly, and he weaves threads of love and betrayal into a thrillingly masterful ending. Modern novels of private turmoil in a difficult time, from Restoration to Birdsong , work because their protagonists are equal to the events they witness. Kennedy can do millennial messy and Fifties dry, but Sara is merely a mouthpiece for torrents of cool-blooded information: a dull woman in an exciting era, and a sorry foil for her creator's prodigious story-telling talent.</p>",

Despite this, it is essentially about ordinariness. Set in the Sixties, the central character, Disa, is a mundane figure; a middle-aged Icelandic woman running an English country hotel with a good reputation for its food. There's almost no dramatic action apart from a slow, solitary journey back home to Iceland, which she undertakes on discovering she has terminal cancer. Most of the journey is spent in a wistful reverie. </p> <p>It doesn't sound like gripping stuff but is nevertheless engrossing as Disa's character gradually opens out. At first she appears gentle, attentive to the comfort of others and given over to the sensual appreciation of food at a time when few in England were. She's also appreciative of Anthony, whom she lives with, and who has enabled her to develop this flair into a formidable reputation as a chef. </p> <p>As the book progresses, however, her small-minded rivalries and her prickliness gradually reveal her as fastidious and unforgiving, living out her sensuality in domesticity and good food. </p> <p>These personal limitations become more comprehensible as Disa struggles to face the history of her alienation from Iceland. She was rejected by her insular family on leaving for England and moved in with a Jewish \u00e9migr\u00e9. When she returned to Iceland in the war, no one sympathised over her fianc\u00e9's fate and she was raped by a Nazi sympathiser. Her empathy for England further alienated her from those of her countrymen who resented the British invasion.Yet she never becomes a fully sympathetic character and we are left with doubts: was she, from earliest childhood, more similar to her stranger, chillier mother than she might care to admit? </p> <p>I was strongly reminded of J.M. Coetzee's Disgrace, even though the gender, personality and hemispheres of the novels are diametrically opposed. What is similar is the vivid voice of the narrative and the powerful sense of place and time; of characters living out lives determined by historical forces which they don't fully grasp. There's also the same wonderfully strong language. In Olafsson's case, it is the slightly off-kilter English of a non-native speaker and the emotive descriptions of the English countryside, which perhaps comes from an Icelander's appreciation of our warmer climes. </p> <p>There are flaws in this novel. Anthony is a clich\u00e9: the son of an aristocrat, a repressed homosexual, but decent fellow. Disa's illness, too, seems inadequately painted. Apart from the odd weariness, it's not at all clear why her days are numbered. Nevertheless, this novel is a tremendous accomplishment. A young, male writer has written one of the most memorable female characters for a long time; a defensive, wounded, sexually repressed, sometimes petty, middle-aged woman. He has also managed as an outsider to capture something of the flavour of England at that time, both in cuisine and mores. </p> <p>Such achievements are all the more extraordinary considering Olafsson's own background. Born in Iceland, he qualified as a physicist, has worked for Sony in New York on PlayStation games and is now vice president of Time Warner Digital Media. Nor has he spent much time in England.

Although it inevitably risks over-simplification, he is right to orientate his account around the violence and confrontation that characterised many of the decade's young writers. </p> <p>This new sense of confrontation came not so much from an extremity of stage action, as from an absence of perspectives that would frame and justify that extremity.

The result is horror in a small room, with little of the broader social, historical or intellectual vision of Churchill, Bond, Brenton and Hare. </p> <p> In-Yer-Face Theatre covers a good range of writers and is greatly strengthened by the inclusion of critics' and audiences' reactions to the plays. Sierz has interviewed most of the major writers, directors and producers and quotes extensively. His chapter on Sarah Kane, whose plays are currently being revived in a short season at the Royal Court, is based on conversations and correspondence with Kane and is the best account of her work to date. </p> <p>That said, I wish that Sierz had written both less and more. Less, because he tends to be a rather heavy-handed critic. Though he rightly declares that his subject is 'experiential, not speculative' theatre, he keeps falling back into the identification of a play's 'message', 'theme,' or 'idea', as if drawn by some form of political gravity. </p> <p>More, because he never follows through the issues which 'in-yer-face theatre' raises. What is the transaction between a middle-class audience and representations of violent working-class lives? What is the role of intellect and judgment in art that, as Schiller put it, 'robs us of our emotional freedom'? Does theatrical pain need a justification? These questions await a more penetrating book. In the meantime, In-Yer-Face Theatre offers a valuable map of difficult and often thrilling terrain. </p>",

In-Yer-Face Theatre covers a good range of writers and is greatly strengthened by the inclusion of critics' and audiences' reactions to the plays. Sierz has interviewed most of the major writers, directors and producers and quotes extensively. His chapter on Sarah Kane, whose plays are currently being revived in a short season at the Royal Court, is based on conversations and correspondence with Kane and is the best account of her work to date. That said, I wish that Sierz had written both less and more. Less, because he tends to be a rather heavy-handed critic. Though he rightly declares that his subject is 'experiential, not speculative' theatre, he keeps falling back into the identification of a play's 'message', 'theme,' or 'idea', as if drawn by some form of political gravity. More, because he never follows through the issues which 'in-yer-face theatre' raises. What is the transaction between a middle-class audience and representations of violent working-class lives? What is the role of intellect and judgment in art that, as Schiller put it, 'robs us of our emotional freedom'? Does theatrical pain need a justification? These questions await a more penetrating book. In the meantime, In-Yer-Face Theatre offers a valuable map of difficult and often thrilling terrain.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>If my life had been more difficult, I would understand my depression very differently. In fact, I had a reasonably happy childhood with two parents who loved me generously, and a younger brother whom they also loved and with whom I got on well. It was a family sufficiently intact that I never even imagined a real battle between my parents, who loved each other very much indeed; though they argued from time to time, they never questioned their absolute devotion to each other and to my brother and me. </p> <p>And then in August 1989, when I was 25, my mother was diagnosed with ovarian cancer and my world began to crumble. If she had not fallen ill, if that story had been a little bit less tragic, then perhaps I would have gone through life with depressive tendencies but no breakdown; or perhaps I would have had a breakdown later on as part of a midlife crisis; or perhaps I would have had one just when and as I did. </p> <p>I will not detail how everything fell apart because to those who have known wasting sickness this will be clear and to those who have not it remains perhaps as inexplicable as it was to me when I was 25. Suffice it to say that in 1991, my mother died. She was 58. I was paralytically sad. Despite tears and sorrow, despite the disappearance of the person I had depended on so constantly and for so long, I did OK in the period after her death. I was sad and I was angry, but I was not crazy. </p> <p>Depression dawns as gradually as adulthood. </p> <p>It was not until June 1994 that I began to notice I was constantly bored. My first novel had been published in England and yet its favourable reception did little for me. I read the reviews indifferently and felt tired all the time. I found myself burdened by social events, even by conversation. It all seemed like more effort than it was worth. I began to feel that no one could love me and that I would never be in a relationship again. I had no sexual feelings at all. I began eating irregularly because I seldom felt hungry. My analyst said it was depression. </p> <p>A loss of feeling, a numbness, infected all my human relations. I didn't care about love, my work, family, friends. My writing slowed, then stopped. 'I know nothing,' the painter Gerhard Richter once wrote. 'I can do nothing. I understand nothing. I know nothing. Nothing. And all this misery does not even make me particularly unhappy.' </p> <p>I was losing my self and that scared me. I made a point of scheduling pleasures into my life. I went to parties and tried and failed to have fun; I saw friends and tried and failed to connect; I bought expensive things I'd wanted in the past and had no satisfaction from them. Your senses slowly abandon you in depression. 'There's a sudden point when you can feel the chemistry going,' Mark Weiss, a depressive friend, once said to me. 'My breathing changes and my breath stinks. My piss smells disgusting. My face comes apart in the mirror. I know when it's there.' </p> <p>For me, this point coincided with the publication of my first novel. A good friend had volunteered to throw a book party for me on 11 October. I love parties and I love books and I knew I should have been ecstatic, but in fact I was too lacklustre to invite many people and too tired to stand up much during the party. I remember that party only in ghostly outlines and washed-out colours: grey food, beige people, muddy light in the rooms. I do remember that I was sweating horribly during it, and that I was dying to leave. No one seemed to notice anything strange. I got through the evening. </p> <p>When I got home, I began to feel frightened. I lay in bed, not sleeping, hugging my pillow for comfort. Over the next two-and-a-half weeks things got worse. Shortly before my thirty-first birthday, I went to pieces. My whole system seemed to be caving in. I was not going out with anyone at the time. My father had volunteered to organise a birthday party for me, but I couldn't bear the idea and we agreed to go to a favourite restaurant with four of my closest friends. </p> <p>On the day before my birthday, I left the house only once, to buy some groceries. On the way home, I suddenly lost control of my lower intestine and soiled myself. I could feel the stain spreading as I hastened home. When I got in, I dropped the grocery bag, rushed to the bathroom, got undressed and went to bed. I did not sleep much that night and I could not get up the following day. I knew I could not go to any restaurant. I wanted to call my friends and cancel, but I couldn't. I lay very still and thought about speaking, trying to figure out how to do it. I moved my tongue but there were no sounds. I had forgotten how to talk. Then I began to cry, but there were no tears, only a heaving incoherence. I was on my back. I wanted to turn over, but I couldn't remember how to do that either. I tried to think about it, but the task seemed colossal. I thought that perhaps I'd had a stroke and then I cried again for a while. </p> <p>At about three that afternoon, I managed to go to the bathroom. I returned to bed shivering. Fortunately, my father called. 'You have to cancel tonight,' I said, my voice shaky. 'What's wrong?' he kept asking, but I didn't know. </p> <p>There is a moment, if you trip or slip, before your hand shoots out to break your fall, when you feel the earth rushing up at you and you cannot help yourself, a passing, fraction-of-a-second terror. I felt that way hour after hour. Being anxious at this extreme level is bizarre. You feel all the time that you want to do something, that there's a physical need of impossible urgency and discomfort for which there is no relief, as though you were constantly vomiting from your stomach but had no mouth. </p> <p>With the depression, your vision narrows and begins to close down. It is like trying to watch TV through terrible static, where you can sort of see the picture but not really; where you cannot ever see people's faces, except almost if there is a close-up; where nothing has edges. The air seems thick and resistant, as though it were full of mushed-up bread. Becoming depressed is like going blind, the darkness at first gradual, then encompassing; it is like going deaf, hearing less and less until a terrible silence is all around you, until you cannot make any sound of your own to penetrate the quiet. </p> <p>My father came down to my apartment with a friend of mine, trailing my brother and his fianc\u00e9e. I had had nothing to eat in almost two days, and they tried to get me to eat a little smoked salmon. Everyone thought I must have some kind of virus. I ate a few bites, then threw up all over myself. I couldn't stop crying. The next day, I managed, somehow, to get to my analyst's office. 'I think I'm going to have to start taking medication,' I said, diving deep for the words. 'I'm sorry,' she said, and called the psychopharmacologist, who agreed to see me in an hour. </p> <p>The psychopharmacologist seemed to have come out of some movie about shrinks. His office had fading mustard-coloured silk wallpaper and was piled high with books with titles such as Addicted to Misery and Suicidal Behaviour: the Search for Psychic Economy. He was in his seventies, smoked cigars, had a Central European accent and wore carpet slippers. He had elegant, prewar manners and a kindly smile.'Well, well,' he said calmly as I trotted out my horrors. 'Very classic symptoms indeed. Don't you worry, we'll soon have you well.' </p> <p>He wrote out a prescription for Xanax, then burrowed around to find a starter kit of Zoloft. He gave me detailed instructions on how to begin taking it. 'You'll come back tomorrow,' he said with a smile. 'The Zoloft will not work for some time. The Xanax will alleviate your anxiety immediately. Do not worry about its addictive qualities and so on, as these are not your problems at the moment. Once we have lifted the anxiety somewhat, we will be able to see the depression more clearly and take care of that.' </p> <p>On my first day on medication, I moved into my father's apartment. My father was almost 70 and most men of that age cannot easily tolerate complete shifts in their lives. My father is to be praised not only for his generous devotion, but also for the flexibility that allowed him to understand how he could be my mainstay through rough times, and for the courage that helped him to be that mainstay. </p> <p>He picked me up at the doctor's and took me home with him. I had not brought clean clothes with me, but I didn't really need them as I was hardly to get out of bed for the next week. Panic was my only sensation. </p> <p>The days were like this: I would wake up, knowing I was experiencing extreme panic. What I wanted was only to take enough panic medication to allow me to go back to sleep, and then I wanted to sleep until I got well. When I would wake up a few hours later, I wanted to take more sleeping pills. Killing myself, like dressing myself, was much too elaborate an agenda to enter my mind; I did not spend hours imagining how I would do such a thing. All I wanted was for 'it' to stop. I could not have managed even to be so specific as to say what 'it' was. </p> <p>Depression, like love, trades in clich\u00e9s, and it is difficult to speak of it without lapsing into the rhetoric of saccharine pop tunes; it is so vivid when it is experienced that the notion that others have known anything similar seems altogether implausible. </p> <p> Depression minutes are like dog years, based on some artificial notion of time. I can remember lying frozen in bed, crying because I was too frightened to take a shower, and at the same time knowing that showers are not scary. I kept running through the individual steps in my mind: you turn and put your feet on the floor; you stand; you walk from here to the bathroom; you open the bathroom door; you walk to the edge of the tub; you turn on the water; you step under the water; you rub yourself with soap; you rinse; you step out; you dry yourself; you walk back to the bed. </p> <p>Twelve steps, which sounded then as onerous as the Stations of the Cross. But I knew, logically, that showers were easy, that for years I had taken a shower every day and that I had done it so quickly and so matter of factly that it had not even warranted comment. I knew that those 12 steps were really quite manageable. </p> <p>So with all the force in my body I would sit up; I would turn and put my feet on the floor; then I would feel so incapacitated and so frightened that I would roll over and lie face down. All over the world people were taking showers. Why, oh why, could I not be one of them? And then I would reflect that those people also had families and jobs and bank accounts and passports and dinner plans and problems, real problems, cancer and hunger and the death of their children and isolating loneliness and failure; and I had so few problems by comparison, except that I couldn't turn over again, until a few hours later, when my father or a friend would come in and help to hoist my feet back up onto the bed. </p> <p>I would lie in the safety of the bed and feel ridiculous. And sometimes in some quiet part of me there was a little bit of laughter at that ridiculousness, and my ability to see that, is, I think, what got me through. Always at the back of my mind there was a voice, calm and clear, that said: don't be so maudlin; don't do anything melodramatic. Take off your clothes, put on your pyjamas, go to bed; in the morning, get up, get dressed, and do whatever it is that you're supposed to do. </p> <p>I heard that voice all the time, that voice like my mother's. There was a sadness and a terrible loneliness as I contemplated what was lost. 'Did anyone - not just the red-hot cultural centre, but anyone, even my dentist - care that I had withdrawn from the fray?' Daphne Merkin wrote in a confessional essay on her own depression. 'Would people mourn me if I never returned, never took up my place again?' </p> <p>By the time evening came around, I was able to get out of bed. Most depression is circadian, improving during the day and then descending again by morning. At dinner, I would feel unable to eat, but I could get up and sit in the dining-room with my father, who cancelled all other plans to be with me. I could also speak by then. I tried to explain what it was like. My father nodded, implacably assured me that it would pass, and tried to make me eat. He cut up my food. I told him not to feed me, that I wasn't five, but when I was defeated by the difficulty of getting a piece of lamb chop on to my fork, he would do it for me. </p> <p>All the while, he would remember feeding me when I was a tiny child, and he would make me promise, jesting, to cut up his lamb chops when he was old and had lost his teeth. He had been in touch with some of my friends, and some of my friends had called me anyway, and after dinner I would feel well enough to call some of them back. Sometimes, one would even come over after dinner. Against the odds, I could usually even have a shower before bed! And no drink after crossing the desert was ever lovelier than that triumph and the cleanliness. Before bed, Xanaxed out but not yet asleep, I would joke with my father and with friends about it, and that rare intimacy that surrounds illness would make itself felt in the room, and sometimes I would feel too much and begin to cry again, and then it was time to turn off the lights, so that I could go back to sleep. </p> <p>Sometimes, friends would sit with me until I drifted off. Some evenings, my father read to me from the books he had read me when I was a child. </p> <p>In the meantime, I still had the reading tour to do. I had to go to bookstores and other venues and stand up in front of groups of strangers and read aloud from the novel I had written. It was a recipe for disaster, but I was determined to get through it. Before the first of these readings, in New York, I spent four hours taking a bath.Then I went and read. I felt as though I had baby powder in my mouth and I couldn't hear well, and I kept thinking I might faint, but I managed to do it. Then a friend helped to get me home and I went back to bed for three days. </p> <p>My next engagements were out in California. I thought I could not go; I knew that I could not go alone. In the end, my father took me there. While I was in a Xanax haze, he got me on and off the plane, out of the airport, to the hotel. I was so drugged up that I was almost asleep, but in this state I could manage. I knew that the more I managed to do the less I would want to die, so it seemed important to go. </p> <p>Doing those readings was the most difficult endeavour of my life. My father joined me for many of the trips; when we were apart, he called me every few hours. A few close friends took on responsibility for me and I was never alone. I can tell you that I was not a fun companion and that deep love and the knowledge of deep love were not by themselves the cure. I can also say that without deep love and the knowledge of deep love, I would not have found it in myself to go through with that tour. I would have found a place to lie down in the woods and I would have stayed there until I froze and died. </p> <p>The terror lifted in December. Whether that was because the drugs had kicked in or the reading tour was over, I do not know. In the end, I cancelled only one reading and managed to visit 11 cities. I made it through Christmas and New Year and I was acting like some semblance of myself. I had lost 15lbs and now I began to put on weight again. My father and my friends all congratulated me on my astonishing progress. I thanked them. </p> <p>In my private self, however, I knew that what had gone away were only symptoms. I hated taking my pills every day. I hated that I had had a breakdown and lost my mind. I was relieved to have made it through the tour, but I was overpowered being in the world, by other people and their lives I couldn't lead, jobs I couldn't do. I was back to about where I had been at the beginning of the depression, only now I understood how bad it could get. I was determined never again to go through such a thing. </p> <p>I felt a little bit like my old self, but the year had been so awful, had shaken me so deeply, that though I was now functioning again, I had also realised that I could not go on.This did not feel irrational, like the terror; it did not feel angry; it felt quite sensible. I had had enough of life and I wanted to figure out how to end it with the least possible damage to the people around me. I needed something to show, so that everyone would understand how desperate I was. I had to give up the invisible impediment for a manifest one. </p> <p>There is little question in my mind that the particular behaviour I chose was highly individual and related to neuroses of my own, but the decision to behave with such a hunger to be rid of the self was typical of agitated depression. All I had to do was to get sick and that would give me permission. The wish for a more visible illness was, I would later learn, a commonplace among depressives, who often engage in forms of self-mutilation to bring the physical state in line with the mental. </p> <p>I could not figure out how to give myself cancer or MS or various other fatal diseases, but I knew just how to get Aids, so I decided to do that. In a park in London, at a lonely hour well after midnight, a short, tubby man with thick tortoiseshell glasses came up and offered himself to me. He pulled down his trousers and bent over. I went to work. I felt as though this were all happening to someone else; I heard his glasses fall off and thought only this: soon I will be dead, so I will never become old and sad like this man. A voice in my head said I had finally started this process and would soon die. I felt such a sense of release and of gratitude. It was not my intention to die slowly of Aids; it was my intention to kill myself with HIV as my excuse. </p> <p>Over the next three months, I sought out other such experiences with strangers whom I assumed to be infected, taking ever greater and more direct risks. I went once a week, often on Wednesdays, to a spot where I could have an economical experience that would infect me. My situation was so different from the vegetative symptoms that had constituted my break-down that it did not occur to me that I was still in the grip of the same illness as before. </p> <p>Then one day in early October, after one of my bouts of unpleasant unsafe sex, this one with a boy who had followed me to a hotel and made a beseeching move in the elevator, I realised that I might be infecting others and that was not my agenda. I had wanted to kill myself, but not the rest of the world. It was time to stop before I began to spread disease everywhere. The knowledge that I would die had also lifted the depression I'd felt. I became gentler again. I calculated how long I would have to wait. I wrote a note to myself of the date in March when six months would have elapsed from the last encounter, when I could get my test, my confirmation. And all the while, I acted fine. </p> <p>By the week of the HIV test, I was taking 12 to 16 milligrams of Xanax every day, so that I could sleep all the time and not be anxious. On Thursday of that week, I got up and checked my messages. The nurse from my doctor's office said: 'Your cholesterol is down, your cardiogram is normal and your HIV test turned out fine.' I called her immediately. It was true. I was HIV-negative after all. As Gatsby said: 'I tried hard to die but have an enchanted life.' </p> <p>I knew then that I wanted to live and I was grateful for the news. Things got steadily better after that. Late in the autumn, I suddenly found that I was lying awake at night, my body trembling, much as it had done at the lowest points of my depression, but I was awake this time with happiness. Years had passed since I had felt happiness at all and I had forgotten what it is like to want to live, to enjoy the day you are in and to long for the next one, to know that you are one of the lucky people for whom life is the living of it. </p> <p>I felt safe from myself. I knew that eternal sadness, though very much within me, did not mitigate the happiness. I turned 33 shortly thereafter, and it was a truly happy birthday, at last. </p> <p>I now have procedures in place for breakdowns. I know which doctors to call and what to say. I know when it's time to put away the razor blades and keep walking the dog. I call around friends and family and say straight out that I'm depressed. </p> <p>Here's what I know that has saved me: act fast; have a good doctor prepared to hear from you; know your own patterns really clearly; regulate sleep and eating, no matter how odious the task may be; lift stresses at once; exercise; mobilise love. </p> <p> <strong> The Noonday Demon: An Anatomy of Depression is published by Chatto at \u00a320.</strong> </p> <p><strong>Andrew Solomon on anti-depressants: do they really work?</strong></p> <p>I am often asked in social situations to describe my own experiences with depression and I usually end by saying that I am on medication. 'Still?' people ask. 'But you seem fine!' To which I invariably reply that I seem fine because I am fine, and that I am fine because of medication. 'So how long do you expect to go on taking this stuff?' people ask. </p> <p>Then I say I will be on medication indefinitely. 'But it's really bad to be on medicine that way,' they say. 'Surely now you are strong enough to be able to phase out some of these drugs!' If you say to them that this is like phasing the carburettor out of your car or the buttresses out of Notre Dame, they laugh. 'So maybe you'll stay on a really low dose?' they ask. You explain that the level of medication you take was chosen because it normalises the systems that can go haywire and that a low dose would be like removing half your carburettor. You add that you have experienced almost no side effects, and that there is no evidence of negative effects of long-term medication. You say you really don't want to get sick again. But wellness is still, in this area, associated not with achieving control of your problem, but with discontinuation of medication: 'Well, I sure hope you get off some time soon,' they say. </p> <p>'I may not know the exact effects of long-term medication,' says John Greden, chair of the department of psychiatry at the University of Michigan. 'No one has yet taken Prozac for 80 years. But I certainly know the effects of nonmedication, or of going on and off medication, or of trying to reduce appropriate doses to inappropriate levels - and those effects are brain damage. We would never treat diabetes or hypertension in this on-again, off-again way; why do we do it with depression? </p> <p>Where has this weird social pressure come from? This illness has an 80 per cent relapse rate within a year without medication, and an 80 per cent wellness rate with medication.' The side effects of these drugs are for most people much healthier than the illness they address. </p> <p>People who take Prozac should watch in the early stages for adverse responses. The drug can cause facial tics and stiffening of muscles. Anti-depressant drugs bring up questions around addiction. The lowered libido, weird dreams, and other effects mentioned on the labelling can be miserable. I accept that we cannot definitively know the very long-term effect of the medications. It is most unfortunate, however, that some scientists have chosen to capitalise on these adverse reactions, spawning an industry of Prozac detractors who misrepresent the drug as a grave peril foisted on an innocent public. </p> <p>I deplore the cynics who keep suffering patients from the essentially benign cures that might give them back their lives.</p>",

      "bodyText": "If my life had been more difficult, I would understand my depression very differently. In fact, I had a reasonably happy childhood with two parents who loved me generously, and a younger brother whom they also loved and with whom I got on well. It was a family sufficiently intact that I never even imagined a real battle between my parents, who loved each other very much indeed; though they argued from time to time, they never questioned their absolute devotion to each other and to my brother and me. And then in August 1989, when I was 25, my mother was diagnosed with ovarian cancer and my world began to crumble. If she had not fallen ill, if that story had been a little bit less tragic, then perhaps I would have gone through life with depressive tendencies but no breakdown; or perhaps I would have had a breakdown later on as part of a midlife crisis; or perhaps I would have had one just when and as I did. I will not detail how everything fell apart because to those who have known wasting sickness this will be clear and to those who have not it remains perhaps as inexplicable as it was to me when I was 25. Suffice it to say that in 1991, my mother died. She was 58. I was paralytically sad. Despite tears and sorrow, despite the disappearance of the person I had depended on so constantly and for so long, I did OK in the period after her death. I was sad and I was angry, but I was not crazy. Depression dawns as gradually as adulthood. It was not until June 1994 that I began to notice I was constantly bored. My first novel had been published in England and yet its favourable reception did little for me. I read the reviews indifferently and felt tired all the time. I found myself burdened by social events, even by conversation. It all seemed like more effort than it was worth. I began to feel that no one could love me and that I would never be in a relationship again. I had no sexual feelings at all. I began eating irregularly because I seldom felt hungry. My analyst said it was depression. A loss of feeling, a numbness, infected all my human relations. I didn't care about love, my work, family, friends. My writing slowed, then stopped. 'I know nothing,' the painter Gerhard Richter once wrote. 'I can do nothing. I understand nothing. I know nothing. Nothing. And all this misery does not even make me particularly unhappy.' I was losing my self and that scared me. I made a point of scheduling pleasures into my life. I went to parties and tried and failed to have fun; I saw friends and tried and failed to connect; I bought expensive things I'd wanted in the past and had no satisfaction from them. Your senses slowly abandon you in depression. 'There's a sudden point when you can feel the chemistry going,' Mark Weiss, a depressive friend, once said to me. 'My breathing changes and my breath stinks. My piss smells disgusting. My face comes apart in the mirror. I know when it's there.' For me, this point coincided with the publication of my first novel. A good friend had volunteered to throw a book party for me on 11 October. I love parties and I love books and I knew I should have been ecstatic, but in fact I was too lacklustre to invite many people and too tired to stand up much during the party. I remember that party only in ghostly outlines and washed-out colours: grey food, beige people, muddy light in the rooms. I do remember that I was sweating horribly during it, and that I was dying to leave. No one seemed to notice anything strange. I got through the evening. When I got home, I began to feel frightened. I lay in bed, not sleeping, hugging my pillow for comfort. Over the next two-and-a-half weeks things got worse. Shortly before my thirty-first birthday, I went to pieces. My whole system seemed to be caving in. I was not going out with anyone at the time. My father had volunteered to organise a birthday party for me, but I couldn't bear the idea and we agreed to go to a favourite restaurant with four of my closest friends. On the day before my birthday, I left the house only once, to buy some groceries. On the way home, I suddenly lost control of my lower intestine and soiled myself. I could feel the stain spreading as I hastened home. When I got in, I dropped the grocery bag, rushed to the bathroom, got undressed and went to bed. I did not sleep much that night and I could not get up the following day. I knew I could not go to any restaurant. I wanted to call my friends and cancel, but I couldn't. I lay very still and thought about speaking, trying to figure out how to do it. I moved my tongue but there were no sounds. I had forgotten how to talk. Then I began to cry, but there were no tears, only a heaving incoherence. I was on my back. I wanted to turn over, but I couldn't remember how to do that either. I tried to think about it, but the task seemed colossal. I thought that perhaps I'd had a stroke and then I cried again for a while. At about three that afternoon, I managed to go to the bathroom. I returned to bed shivering. Fortunately, my father called. 'You have to cancel tonight,' I said, my voice shaky. 'What's wrong?' he kept asking, but I didn't know. There is a moment, if you trip or slip, before your hand shoots out to break your fall, when you feel the earth rushing up at you and you cannot help yourself, a passing, fraction-of-a-second terror. I felt that way hour after hour. Being anxious at this extreme level is bizarre. You feel all the time that you want to do something, that there's a physical need of impossible urgency and discomfort for which there is no relief, as though you were constantly vomiting from your stomach but had no mouth. With the depression, your vision narrows and begins to close down. It is like trying to watch TV through terrible static, where you can sort of see the picture but not really; where you cannot ever see people's faces, except almost if there is a close-up; where nothing has edges. The air seems thick and resistant, as though it were full of mushed-up bread. Becoming depressed is like going blind, the darkness at first gradual, then encompassing; it is like going deaf, hearing less and less until a terrible silence is all around you, until you cannot make any sound of your own to penetrate the quiet. My father came down to my apartment with a friend of mine, trailing my brother and his fianc\u00e9e. I had had nothing to eat in almost two days, and they tried to get me to eat a little smoked salmon. Everyone thought I must have some kind of virus. I ate a few bites, then threw up all over myself. I couldn't stop crying. The next day, I managed, somehow, to get to my analyst's office. 'I think I'm going to have to start taking medication,' I said, diving deep for the words. 'I'm sorry,' she said, and called the psychopharmacologist, who agreed to see me in an hour. The psychopharmacologist seemed to have come out of some movie about shrinks. His office had fading mustard-coloured silk wallpaper and was piled high with books with titles such as Addicted to Misery and Suicidal Behaviour: the Search for Psychic Economy. He was in his seventies, smoked cigars, had a Central European accent and wore carpet slippers. He had elegant, prewar manners and a kindly smile.'Well, well,' he said calmly as I trotted out my horrors. 'Very classic symptoms indeed. Don't you worry, we'll soon have you well.' He wrote out a prescription for Xanax, then burrowed around to find a starter kit of Zoloft. He gave me detailed instructions on how to begin taking it. 'You'll come back tomorrow,' he said with a smile. 'The Zoloft will not work for some time. The Xanax will alleviate your anxiety immediately. Do not worry about its addictive qualities and so on, as these are not your problems at the moment. Once we have lifted the anxiety somewhat, we will be able to see the depression more clearly and take care of that.' On my first day on medication, I moved into my father's apartment. My father was almost 70 and most men of that age cannot easily tolerate complete shifts in their lives. My father is to be praised not only for his generous devotion, but also for the flexibility that allowed him to understand how he could be my mainstay through rough times, and for the courage that helped him to be that mainstay. He picked me up at the doctor's and took me home with him. I had not brought clean clothes with me, but I didn't really need them as I was hardly to get out of bed for the next week. Panic was my only sensation. The days were like this: I would wake up, knowing I was experiencing extreme panic. What I wanted was only to take enough panic medication to allow me to go back to sleep, and then I wanted to sleep until I got well. When I would wake up a few hours later, I wanted to take more sleeping pills. Killing myself, like dressing myself, was much too elaborate an agenda to enter my mind; I did not spend hours imagining how I would do such a thing. All I wanted was for 'it' to stop. I could not have managed even to be so specific as to say what 'it' was. Depression, like love, trades in clich\u00e9s, and it is difficult to speak of it without lapsing into the rhetoric of saccharine pop tunes; it is so vivid when it is experienced that the notion that others have known anything similar seems altogether implausible. Depression minutes are like dog years, based on some artificial notion of time. I can remember lying frozen in bed, crying because I was too frightened to take a shower, and at the same time knowing that showers are not scary. I kept running through the individual steps in my mind: you turn and put your feet on the floor; you stand; you walk from here to the bathroom; you open the bathroom door; you walk to the edge of the tub; you turn on the water; you step under the water; you rub yourself with soap; you rinse; you step out; you dry yourself; you walk back to the bed. Twelve steps, which sounded then as onerous as the Stations of the Cross. But I knew, logically, that showers were easy, that for years I had taken a shower every day and that I had done it so quickly and so matter of factly that it had not even warranted comment. I knew that those 12 steps were really quite manageable. So with all the force in my body I would sit up; I would turn and put my feet on the floor; then I would feel so incapacitated and so frightened that I would roll over and lie face down. All over the world people were taking showers. Why, oh why, could I not be one of them? And then I would reflect that those people also had families and jobs and bank accounts and passports and dinner plans and problems, real problems, cancer and hunger and the death of their children and isolating loneliness and failure; and I had so few problems by comparison, except that I couldn't turn over again, until a few hours later, when my father or a friend would come in and help to hoist my feet back up onto the bed. I would lie in the safety of the bed and feel ridiculous. And sometimes in some quiet part of me there was a little bit of laughter at that ridiculousness, and my ability to see that, is, I think, what got me through. Always at the back of my mind there was a voice, calm and clear, that said: don't be so maudlin; don't do anything melodramatic. Take off your clothes, put on your pyjamas, go to bed; in the morning, get up, get dressed, and do whatever it is that you're supposed to do. I heard that voice all the time, that voice like my mother's. There was a sadness and a terrible loneliness as I contemplated what was lost. 'Did anyone - not just the red-hot cultural centre, but anyone, even my dentist - care that I had withdrawn from the fray?' Daphne Merkin wrote in a confessional essay on her own depression.

Then one day in early October, after one of my bouts of unpleasant unsafe sex, this one with a boy who had followed me to a hotel and made a beseeching move in the elevator, I realised that I might be infecting others and that was not my agenda. I had wanted to kill myself, but not the rest of the world. It was time to stop before I began to spread disease everywhere. The knowledge that I would die had also lifted the depression I'd felt. I became gentler again. I calculated how long I would have to wait. I wrote a note to myself of the date in March when six months would have elapsed from the last encounter, when I could get my test, my confirmation. And all the while, I acted fine. By the week of the HIV test, I was taking 12 to 16 milligrams of Xanax every day, so that I could sleep all the time and not be anxious. On Thursday of that week, I got up and checked my messages. The nurse from my doctor's office said: 'Your cholesterol is down, your cardiogram is normal and your HIV test turned out fine.' I called her immediately. It was true. I was HIV-negative after all. As Gatsby said: 'I tried hard to die but have an enchanted life.' I knew then that I wanted to live and I was grateful for the news. Things got steadily better after that. Late in the autumn, I suddenly found that I was lying awake at night, my body trembling, much as it had done at the lowest points of my depression, but I was awake this time with happiness. Years had passed since I had felt happiness at all and I had forgotten what it is like to want to live, to enjoy the day you are in and to long for the next one, to know that you are one of the lucky people for whom life is the living of it. I felt safe from myself. I knew that eternal sadness, though very much within me, did not mitigate the happiness. I turned 33 shortly thereafter, and it was a truly happy birthday, at last. I now have procedures in place for breakdowns. I know which doctors to call and what to say. I know when it's time to put away the razor blades and keep walking the dog. I call around friends and family and say straight out that I'm depressed. Here's what I know that has saved me: act fast; have a good doctor prepared to hear from you; know your own patterns really clearly; regulate sleep and eating, no matter how odious the task may be; lift stresses at once; exercise; mobilise love. The Noonday Demon: An Anatomy of Depression is published by Chatto at \u00a320. Andrew Solomon on anti-depressants: do they really work? I am often asked in social situations to describe my own experiences with depression and I usually end by saying that I am on medication. 'Still?' people ask. 'But you seem fine!' To which I invariably reply that I seem fine because I am fine, and that I am fine because of medication. 'So how long do you expect to go on taking this stuff?' people ask. Then I say I will be on medication indefinitely. 'But it's really bad to be on medicine that way,' they say. 'Surely now you are strong enough to be able to phase out some of these drugs!' If you say to them that this is like phasing the carburettor out of your car or the buttresses out of Notre Dame, they laugh. 'So maybe you'll stay on a really low dose?' they ask. You explain that the level of medication you take was chosen because it normalises the systems that can go haywire and that a low dose would be like removing half your carburettor. You add that you have experienced almost no side effects, and that there is no evidence of negative effects of long-term medication. You say you really don't want to get sick again. But wellness is still, in this area, associated not with achieving control of your problem, but with discontinuation of medication: 'Well, I sure hope you get off some time soon,' they say. 'I may not know the exact effects of long-term medication,' says John Greden, chair of the department of psychiatry at the University of Michigan. 'No one has yet taken Prozac for 80 years. But I certainly know the effects of nonmedication, or of going on and off medication, or of trying to reduce appropriate doses to inappropriate levels - and those effects are brain damage. We would never treat diabetes or hypertension in this on-again, off-again way; why do we do it with depression? Where has this weird social pressure come from? This illness has an 80 per cent relapse rate within a year without medication, and an 80 per cent wellness rate with medication.' The side effects of these drugs are for most people much healthier than the illness they address. People who take Prozac should watch in the early stages for adverse responses. The drug can cause facial tics and stiffening of muscles. Anti-depressant drugs bring up questions around addiction. The lowered libido, weird dreams, and other effects mentioned on the labelling can be miserable. I accept that we cannot definitively know the very long-term effect of the medications. It is most unfortunate, however, that some scientists have chosen to capitalise on these adverse reactions, spawning an industry of Prozac detractors who misrepresent the drug as a grave peril foisted on an innocent public. I deplore the cynics who keep suffering patients from the essentially benign cures that might give them back their lives.",

      "body": "<p>I like food that has an edge to it. Hot, piquant, sharp, vital. I like food that makes me smack my lips. That 'edge' can come in many ways: the ingredients themselves, or the way in which they are cooked, or indeed from the way the food is seasoned. The edge is sharp, yes, but also a little fruity and piquant, and capable of lifting the flavours of the main ingredient, or at any rate, stopping it from cloying. </p> <p>Lemon and lime juice and red- and white-wine vinegar are the obvious ways to give bite, edge, to meat, fish or vegetables or cooking juices. There are also the less obvious heroes such as lemon grass, kaffir limes, anchovies and capers. And a few months ago I came across a new way of adding that tang of vitality to my cooking: verjuice, the juice of sour grapes. </p> <p>You will hearing quite a bit about verjuice. It is an ingredient whose time seems to have come. (It has been here once before, around the 14th century, and some say during Roman times.) I am normally rather sceptical of 'new' ingredients but this one rings true. This clear, golden liquid is like an exceptionally fruity vinegar and, since I have had a bottle in the fridge, I have exploited its mellow tartness (strange description, but actually spot on) both in a salad dressing and three times now to deglaze the pan from a roast. Yesterday I shook the bottle into the pan juices of some fried lamb steaks. Other cooks tell me you can add it to the water for poaching pears. It is the only ingredient I can think of that manages to add both piquancy and depth. </p> <p>Once a rare thing, made only by a few enthusiasts with access to unripe grapes, verjuice was very much a cult seasoning. This, I suspect, is about to change. Australian food writer Maggie Beer has done more than anyone to bring this ancient ingredient back from oblivion. At her farm in the Barossa Valley she makes enough to send around the world. Japan, always ahead of the game, is a big market, and in Britain manageable- sized bottles even turn up in Sainsbury's. Beer's Cooking with Verjuice (\u00a314.99, Grub Street) has just been published here. </p> <p>Another squeeze guaranteed to add vigour to your cooking is lime juice. I find it more aromatic than lemon (the small, almost juiceless Southeast Asian limes being even more so). Limes work best with ginger, garlic and chillies, but I use them also to highlight softly flavoured tropical fruit such as mango and papaya. Half a papaya with a squeeze of lime is about as fine a breakfast as God put on this earth. </p> <p>I have met plenty of people disappointed with the contents of a lime. And fair enough, there isn't much there if you press them vivid green and hard, and even less if you have kept them in the fridge. To get the most racy and copious juice, let your limes soften - they are best when on the turn from green to yellow, and are soft enough that your thumb makes an impression. Rock-hard limes give a juice that is bitter. </p> <p>Best use for lime juice this week has been the day I tossed fried aubergines in a green salad dressed with lime, mint and coriander. A bowl full of hot, vibrant flavours that redeemed a day in which I'd consumed too much bland and fatty food. </p> <p>Practically, the snap of piquancy that lifts food from its doldrums is invariably added at the end of cooking. Freshness can be elusive. That squeeze of juice or dash of vinegar is something that generally only does its stuff when you use it as a last-minute flavour adjuster. Verjuice can be added at any point. I rubbed a small loin of pork with it the other day before roasting, then added some to the gravy at the end and the meat benefited doubly. </p> <p>Fish sauce, the Thai nam pla, will add deep savour to any clear soup or salad dressing you shake the bottle into; soy sauce will add enough salt to make your lips tingle, and capers will lift even the creamiest of sauces from the depths of 'blandom'. A handful of seasonings that make your cooking sing, to lift its spirits, to give it that 'edge'. </p> <p><strong> Aubergine and rocket salad with mint and lime juice</strong><br> </p> <p> Sour, hot, aromatic. A light, lip-smacking salad for a main dish. (Don't even think of drinking wine with it - if the fish sauce doesn't kill it, the lime juice will. Drink beer.) You will need something to follow. We had rice pudding. Serves 2 as a main-course salad. </p> <p>1 large aubergine </p> <p>a loose palmful of coriander leaves (30 or so) </p> <p>20 mint leaves </p> <p>10 large basil leaves (the Italian sort) </p> <p>olive oil (light and not too fruity) for shallow frying </p> <p>4 double handfuls of mixed green salad leaves </p> <p>(rocket, mizuna, oak leaf, little gem, etc) </p> <p><strong> for the dressing</strong><br> </p> <p>2 tbsp nam pla (Thai fish sauce) </p> <p>2 tbsp lime juice </p> <p>1 medium-sized, rather hot, red chilli </p> <p>1 tsp dark soy sauce </p> <p>2 tsp caster sugar </p> <p>Slice the aubergine into rounds then in half, put them in a bowl, sprinkle heavily with salt and leave to drain. Leave them for no more than an hour. </p> <p>Stir the nam pla, lime juice, soy sauce and caster sugar until the sugar has dissolved. Finely chop the chilli, discarding the seeds if you wish, and add it. </p> <p>Rinse and pat the aubergines dry with kitchen paper. Warm a shallow layer of olive oil in a heavy frying pan. Lay the aubergine slices flat in the hot oil and cook until they are a deep golden brown on the underside, then turn and cook the other side. Remove them and drain them on kitchen paper. </p> <p>Rinse the salad leaves. Pour the dressing into a large salad bowl, add the chopped coriander, mint and the torn basil leaves, then add the cooked aubergines. Add the salad leaves to the bowl. Toss all the ingredients gently together and serve. </p> <p><strong> Chicken with verjuice, celery and cream</strong><br> </p> <p> This is a rich dish, but stops short of cloying thanks to the grapey-apple sharpness of the verjuice. Greens are essential - spinach or spring greens. One plump free-range chicken thigh is enough for me, but bigger eaters or those who can only track down small chicken pieces may want two. Serves 4. </p> <p>4-8 chicken thighs (depending on their size) </p> <p>olive oil </p> <p>4 celery sticks </p> <p>verjuice </p> <p>3 bay leaves </p> <p>most of a small pot (147ml) of double cream </p> <p>2 heaped tsp capers, rinsed (more if you wish) </p> <p><strong> to serve</strong><br> </p> <p>large floury potatoes </p> <p>spring greens </p> <p>Warm a heavy casserole over a medium heat, with enough olive oil to cover the bottom. Turn the oven to 200 C/gas mark 6. Rub the chicken pieces generously with oil, salt and pepper, then lay them skin-side down in the hot oil and let the skin colour. </p> <p>In the 5 or so minutes it takes the chicken to colour, wash and chop the celery. You need it to be in short pieces the length of a cork. Turn the chicken over, and as you do so, add the celery to the pan. Leave for a couple of minutes, tucking the celery in around the meat, then add 3 or 4 glugs of verjuice and the bay leaves. As the steam rises, cover tightly with a lid then put the whole thing in the oven. </p> <p>At this point, peel and cut the potatoes, get a pot of water boiling for them, and get the greens ready, washing them thoroughly and removing any tatty bits of leaf or tough-looking stems. </p> <p>After half an hour, lift the lid and turn the chicken and celery over in the juices, then return to the oven for 20 minutes, minus its lid. Meanwhile, drop the potatoes into the boiling water and salt them. </p> <p>Put the greens on. I put a steamer pan over the boiling potatoes, but you could cook the (still-wet) greens into a pan with a lid. Remove the chicken from the oven and switch it off. Lift the meat on to a serving dish and return it to the oven, then pour off any fat, leaving any interesting-looking juices in place, then put the pan over a moderate heat. Pour in a few glugs of verjuice and let it come to the boil. </p> <p>Once it starts bubbling and reducing a bit, pour in the cream, stirring at the bottom of the pan to dislodge any tasty bits, season with salt and black pepper, then let the juices bubble until they start to thicken a wee bit and turn deep ivory in colour. </p> <p>Spoon the creamy juices over the chicken and serve with the greens and the potatoes, squashing your spuds into the chicken juice. </p> <p><strong> Maggie Beer's fillet of pork with sage and verjuice</strong><br> </p> <p> I print Maggie's recipe as it is in her book, though I made a few changes when I cooked it for lunch. She specifies an 800g pork fillet for4, but as most pork fillets in this country are 400g, and will also feed 4, I simply halved the amount of meat. Cooked for 10 minutes, then covered and rested for 15, a 425g fillet was just about perfect. Serves 4. </p> <p>1 fillet of pork (about 425g) </p> <p>30ml extra-virgin olive oil </p> <p>2 cloves garlic, minced </p> <p>32 sage leaves </p> <p>110ml verjuice </p> <p>60g butter </p> <p>Preheat the oven to 190 C/gas mark 5. Trim the meat, then mix the oil, garlic, and some salt and pepper, and brush the meat with it. Press a few of the sage leaves on to the meat, then seal the pork on all sides over gentle heat in a heavy-based baking dish. Deglaze the pan with the verjuice, then roast the meat for 10 minutes. Remove it from the oven and allow to rest, covered, for 15 minutes. Turn up the oven to 200 C/gas mark 6. </p> <p>Dot the remaining sage leaves with the butter, and crisp them in the oven for 9 minutes, then tip them over the resting meat.

      "body": "<p>Continuing my highly selective tour of Britain, this week's stopover is in the Black Country. For the record, this is roughly the area west of the M6, with Dudley in its centre and Wolverhampton marking its north-western corner, Walsall the north-eastern one, Stourbridge the south-western one and the bottom right-hand corner at Halesowen. Roughly. </p> <p>There are fierce arguments as to where the boundaries lie, but be sure of one thing: if you want to offend someone from the Black Country, call them a Brummie. They hate Birmingham people with the intensity that only neighbours can muster. This passion stems from a real sense of identity with the Black Country as a separate place where they belong. Just as the division between Chelsea and Fulham or Mumbles and Swansea is so much greater than any geographical measurement, so I could stand on the Dudley bypass with the entire Black Country in view and ask someone if they were local. 'No, no,' he replied, looking as though I had asked a City fan if he supported United, 'I come from Tipton.' Tipton, for the uninitiated, is all of a mile away. And so it was for Netherton, Oldbury, Quarry Bank, Brierley Hill, Coseley, Bilston, Cradley and all the other areas that merge indistinguishably to the outsider. Home is where the difference is. </p> <p>But all these places share the same geology. The Black Country was created out of the demand for iron, steel and glass goods - anything from ships to hat pins - and the geology of that area which provided a thick seam of coal near the surface, limestone for slaking and adding to the steel, clay for bricks, charcoal from the wooded wastes, sand for the glass, a high-water table so water was accessible, and the canal system - famously more intensive than the one in Venice - easier to make. Everything needed for an Industrial Revolution was there within those few square miles. </p> <p>I guess the teeming poor that serviced the thousands of foundries, nail shops, glass works, coal mines and factories had little time or energy for gardening. There was no recreation. The toughest clung on to life grimly. Most died young. If there was space, a pig would take the place of a lawn and perhaps some potatoes or onions the rest. Gardening as we know it was for the privileged few. </p> <p>One of the few who was around rather before the industrialisation of the area was William Shenstone. He was born in 1714 and died in 1763, having written a large quantity of forgettable poetry, but having had a historic influence on gardening. Shenstone inherited The Leasowes, a small estate between Stourbridge and Halesowen, and \u00a3300 a year, which was quite enough to sustain a life of gentle, literary pursuits. Instead, he blew the money in making the land into a ferme orn\u00e9e. </p> <p>This was a highly manufactured and manicured landscape, predating Capability Brown by years. The idea was that you (not you the Black Country worker or you the farmer, but you the genteel visitor) took a winding path through the farmland, coming across grottoes and groves, lakes with waterfalls and lanes leading to sequestered seats emblazoned with a suitable epitaph - written, of course, by Shenstone himself. There is a poignancy in this stage-crafted countryside, in light of the industrial intensity that was to draw up around it, but it was hugely influential.

      "bodyText": "Continuing my highly selective tour of Britain, this week's stopover is in the Black Country. For the record, this is roughly the area west of the M6, with Dudley in its centre and Wolverhampton marking its north-western corner, Walsall the north-eastern one, Stourbridge the south-western one and the bottom right-hand corner at Halesowen. Roughly. There are fierce arguments as to where the boundaries lie, but be sure of one thing: if you want to offend someone from the Black Country, call them a Brummie. They hate Birmingham people with the intensity that only neighbours can muster. This passion stems from a real sense of identity with the Black Country as a separate place where they belong. Just as the division between Chelsea and Fulham or Mumbles and Swansea is so much greater than any geographical measurement, so I could stand on the Dudley bypass with the entire Black Country in view and ask someone if they were local. 'No, no,' he replied, looking as though I had asked a City fan if he supported United, 'I come from Tipton.' Tipton, for the uninitiated, is all of a mile away. And so it was for Netherton, Oldbury, Quarry Bank, Brierley Hill, Coseley, Bilston, Cradley and all the other areas that merge indistinguishably to the outsider. Home is where the difference is. But all these places share the same geology. The Black Country was created out of the demand for iron, steel and glass goods - anything from ships to hat pins - and the geology of that area which provided a thick seam of coal near the surface, limestone for slaking and adding to the steel, clay for bricks, charcoal from the wooded wastes, sand for the glass, a high-water table so water was accessible, and the canal system - famously more intensive than the one in Venice - easier to make. Everything needed for an Industrial Revolution was there within those few square miles. I guess the teeming poor that serviced the thousands of foundries, nail shops, glass works, coal mines and factories had little time or energy for gardening. There was no recreation. The toughest clung on to life grimly. Most died young. If there was space, a pig would take the place of a lawn and perhaps some potatoes or onions the rest. Gardening as we know it was for the privileged few. One of the few who was around rather before the industrialisation of the area was William Shenstone. He was born in 1714 and died in 1763, having written a large quantity of forgettable poetry, but having had a historic influence on gardening. Shenstone inherited The Leasowes, a small estate between Stourbridge and Halesowen, and \u00a3300 a year, which was quite enough to sustain a life of gentle, literary pursuits. Instead, he blew the money in making the land into a ferme orn\u00e9e. This was a highly manufactured and manicured landscape, predating Capability Brown by years. The idea was that you (not you the Black Country worker or you the farmer, but you the genteel visitor) took a winding path through the farmland, coming across grottoes and groves, lakes with waterfalls and lanes leading to sequestered seats emblazoned with a suitable epitaph - written, of course, by Shenstone himself. There is a poignancy in this stage-crafted countryside, in light of the industrial intensity that was to draw up around it, but it was hugely influential. It tamed nature and took the garden beyond the tight parameters of the formal parterre. (William Kent was doing a similar thing, and more brilliantly, at Rousham and Stowe, but he was creating a series of dramatic tableaux, heavy with classical reference and symbolism.) Shenstone was touching on something closer to the English ruralist heart and creating something that we still feel we own in our modern take on the countryside. By creating this hybrid between garden and farm, he fixed a notion of the romantic rural dream that has never really gone away, despite foot-and-mouth disease, BSE and the hideous monster of industrialised, high-intensity farming. Shenstone's Unconnected Thoughts on Gardening was published posthumously as part of his catch-all Works (1764). I went to the Leasowes with this pocket of history tucked inside me, expecting... Oh, I don't know. Expecting the mixture of costume drama, disappointment and confusion that accompanies any visit to a historic site. What I got was farce. The Leasowes is now a golf course and a flow of large-bottomed men in check trousers waddled round knocking balls into bushes. It was made more surreal by the fact that I had to interview a local Labour MP while she pretended to draw a tree (don't ask), who said proudly that she 'did not have a single field in her constituency', so foot-and-mouth disease was not a problem she had to deal with, and that anyway, she had 'no sympathy for the farmers because they didn't show any sympathy when the steel workers lost their jobs, but did feel very sorry for the poor animals'.

But a major new study now suggests that for millions of people, binge shopping is no longer an emotional cure-all. If anything, it may make you feel worse.</p> <p>Despite the highest British income levels ever and a buoyant economy, researchers - who interviewed 1,000 people - found most were profoundly unhappy: 55 per cent said they had felt depressed in the past year. Those who said they had been depressed were twice as likely to say that they had bought something later and regretted it.</p> <p>'For significant numbers, dissatisfaction is now part of the shopping process,' said Lucy Purdy, of analysts Publicis, which carried out the nationwide study. 'It's adding into the dissatisfaction that causes many people to go shopping in the first place. Shopping is offering a short-term buzz, but as a society we now recognise that and we're getting fed up with short-term emotions.'</p> <p>Publicis also found that 44 per cent of purchasers from the affluent AB social categories, which are much sought-after by advertisers, said they found many companies off-putting.</p> <p>Purdy said: 'Ethical consumerism is a slow burn. It is definitely making inroads. Consumers recognised, for example, that they were able to exert power through their wallets on supermarkets over GM foods. A lot of companies don't appreciate that what consumers in a bad mood do is just not buy their product again.'</p> <p>The psychologist Oliver James, author of Britain on the Couch, said: 'We're now seeing a generation of Thatcher's children. They were soaked in the values of the winner-loser culture and brought up to believe that the pursuit of status and wealth was the root to fulfilment. This has turned out to be manifestly not true.</p> <p>'If you are in the top two thirds of earners in a developed nation, how much richer you are now has no bearing on your mental health or wellbeing.'</p> <p>Purdy added: 'Unhappy people are most likely to be trying to change their lives through purchasing. They will be changing their diet, or their appearance, or their homes. And it does appear to be younger, more affluent people who are doing the most dysfunctional shopping for things they don't really want or need.'</p> <p>To James, lack of satisfaction for women is understandable, whether they are married with children or living a Bridget Jones nightmare.

      "bodyText": "For a generation, 'retail therapy' has offered the ultimate salvation from the stresses of modern living. But a major new study now suggests that for millions of people, binge shopping is no longer an emotional cure-all. If anything, it may make you feel worse. Despite the highest British income levels ever and a buoyant economy, researchers - who interviewed 1,000 people - found most were profoundly unhappy: 55 per cent said they had felt depressed in the past year. Those who said they had been depressed were twice as likely to say that they had bought something later and regretted it. 'For significant numbers, dissatisfaction is now part of the shopping process,' said Lucy Purdy, of analysts Publicis, which carried out the nationwide study. 'It's adding into the dissatisfaction that causes many people to go shopping in the first place. Shopping is offering a short-term buzz, but as a society we now recognise that and we're getting fed up with short-term emotions.' Publicis also found that 44 per cent of purchasers from the affluent AB social categories, which are much sought-after by advertisers, said they found many companies off-putting. Purdy said: 'Ethical consumerism is a slow burn. It is definitely making inroads. Consumers recognised, for example, that they were able to exert power through their wallets on supermarkets over GM foods. A lot of companies don't appreciate that what consumers in a bad mood do is just not buy their product again.' The psychologist Oliver James, author of Britain on the Couch, said: 'We're now seeing a generation of Thatcher's children. They were soaked in the values of the winner-loser culture and brought up to believe that the pursuit of status and wealth was the root to fulfilment. This has turned out to be manifestly not true. 'If you are in the top two thirds of earners in a developed nation, how much richer you are now has no bearing on your mental health or wellbeing.' Purdy added: 'Unhappy people are most likely to be trying to change their lives through purchasing. They will be changing their diet, or their appearance, or their homes. And it does appear to be younger, more affluent people who are doing the most dysfunctional shopping for things they don't really want or need.' To James, lack of satisfaction for women is understandable, whether they are married with children or living a Bridget Jones nightmare. 'They were led to believe that anything was possible. In reality, in the vast majority of cases, they still end up working very hard to make somebody else rich. And the advertisements which encouraged them to believe consumption was the root of all happiness have been strongly instrumental in creating discontent with their bodies and personalities.' In London's Oxford Street yesterday, Rachel Yates, a PA from Yorkshire, admitted: 'I go shopping when I feel low to cheer myself up. It does make me feel better but only for that night really. Often having spent the money makes me feel worse later on.' Telephonist Margaret Kurmi, from Guildford, said: 'I go shopping to cheer myself up. But nowadays it only makes me feel good for 24 hours.' The European Union published a continent-wide survey into addictive spending earlier this year. It found that 33 per cent of consumers displayed a 'high level of addiction to rash or unnecessary consumption'. The tendency often led to indebtedness.

      "body": "<p>In mid-December last year, following a humiliating cup defeat, an enraged Inter fan threw a Molotov cocktail outside the San Siro stadium. This was significant for two reasons.

Marco Tardelli, the coach, was one of many on board badly shaken by the attack. 'I just cannot accept this type of violence bursting its way into football,' he said. 'After the Heysel disaster, this is the worst that's ever happened to me in football. Next thing they'll be shooting at us from the grandstand.'</p> <p>The firebomb was just one example of an escalating crisis, with a huge increase in the number of violent incidents(see panel). One disturbing trend has been the proliferation of attacks by supporters on their own team or team officials, whether it be Roma fans ambushing players arriving at the Trigoria training ground, Brescia supporters smashing the window of a car carrying their club president's daughter, Pescara forced to train under police protection, Reggina president Pasquale Foti receiving a severed calf's head in the post, or Napoli ultras lobbing a bomb into the garden of the club's part-owner Corrado Ferlaino. </p> <p>Not that the violence has been limited to fans turning on their own. In some towns and cities it has become almost routine with railway and bus stations hosting battles between rival supporters. Three Serie A clubs - Napoli, Reggina and Vicenza \u00dc have been ordered to play home games away from their own stadium this season as a punishment for their fans' violent behaviour.</p> <p>To an extent the increasing violence can be traced to the same dynamic as the increased racism: orchestration by politically motivated infiltrators. But there are other causes. Some are banal: an early season clash between rivals almost guarantees a revenge cycle. The police, too, are often the intended victims; indeed, for many ultras the police \u00dc as the embodiment of authority - are the primary target. 'They want to stop me doing what I want to do,' Lorenzo, the head of the Roma ultras told Channel Four. 'So I must react violently. That's what the young guys in the curva think. The Curva is a territory that the ultras must defend.'</p> <p>Sometimes opposition fans are deliberately attacked to provoke the police. Friends of a badly beaten Roma fan vowed revenge at the next match - which happened to be against Liverpool. According to one ultra, Liverpool supporters were stabbed solely to draw in police. It worked. Bottles, stones and petrol bombs rained down as soon as they arrived.</p> <p>Giuliano Zincone, the Corriere della Sera columnist, provides an almost Hobbesian analysis of the racism and violence, with football providing a safety valve for a society of base, violent instincts. </p> <p>'The sports stadium is the only, and perhaps the last remaining place where extreme, cruel, dirty and primitive feelings are expressed,' he writes. 'It is the open-air catacomb for the barbaric custom of wishing the greatest possible misfortune on one's rivals, cast as infidels. That's the way it is. There is, and long has been, a minority that likes to go to the stadium in order to shout disgusting slogans, to vent hostility and give voice to the aggression and antagonism that are prohibited elsewhere.</p> <p>'Many people go to the stadium for the specific purpose of \"offending\". Unleashing the spirit of rebellion and complete antagonism is part of the modern soccer stadium just as cruelty was part of the operational functions of the Roman Colosseum. In the stadium, verbal violence can serve as a proxy for real violence.</p> <p>'The stadium is the platform for an almost religious and warlike devotion to one's favourite team... the vile banners do not, as a rule, express actual political inclinations, but reflect a vague desire to \"be somewhere else\", to seek direct conflicts rather than languish constantly in the bland repression and pacifications required by everyday collective life.</p> <p>'Cruel sentiments exist and perhaps it is better to contain them, to let them shout themselves out in stadiums, than to prohibit them there and find them cropping up again, ominously, in city streets and squares.'</p> <p>'Only suckers stick to the rules if the game is rigged,' writes a Juventus fan on an ultra website. It is a refrain heard all over Italy. Rumours of Serie A corruption surface weekly, fuelling a sense that the league operates above the law. </p> <p>The revelation that Lazio's Argentine star midfielder Juan Veron had a forged Italian passport shocked the league. Dozens of clubs and foreign players are under investigation for allegedly faking documents and inventing Italian ancestors to circumvent limits on non-European Union players. Prodded into action by Fifa, the Italian federation has yet to reach conclusions but stars such as Inter's Uruguayan forward Alvaro Recoba are unlikely to emerge unscathed. Time will tell whether the villains were players, agents or clubs. All protest their innocence. </p> <p>Italy is not the only country tarnished by the passports scandal \u00dc but only Italy could come up with the Night of the Watches. Gold Rolexes given by Roma to referees were returned lest the 'Christmas presents' conveyed the wrong impression. A federation inquiry flushed out expensive offerings from other clubs, such as holidays paid by Juventus. 'Where does the fine line between a kind gift and a bribe lie?' asked Corriere della Sera. The perception that Serie A's referees are on the take is widespread, the image of it as a corrupt league, long lasting and difficult to shift.</p> <p>A year ago as the Serie A title built toa nail-bitingly close climax, Juventus benefited from an extraordinary piece of refereeing against Parma. A last-minute equaliser was inexplicably disallowed, giving Juve a dubious and vital victory with one week of the season left. A tidal wave of anti-Juve feeling swept Italy including a street 'funeral for Italian football' and the front page headline on the Corriere dello Sport, 'Sorry, but this is a scandal'. (Juventus lost their final game and the championship went to Lazio after all.) This was in the same season that an Italian Serie A player wrote a letter to the Catholic magazine Famiglia Cristiana claiming he was bribed to lose a match. The magazine rebuffed magistrates' inquiries, saying its letters column was akin to a confessional.</p> <p>Juve have been accused before. Three years ago the 'season of poison' culminated in a controversial game in which Inter were denied a blatant penalty. 'Referees don't do this on purpose,' raged the Inter president Massimo Moratti, 'it's a habit. They are afraid of hurting Juventus. It is the rule, not the exception.' The former Italian international Roberto Mancini went a lot further, saying 'the last fair championship was won in 1991 by Sampdoria'.</p> <p>This season has seen new match-fixing scandals. A cup match between Atlanta and Pistoiese provoked much interest after a rush of inspired bets that the game would end 1-1, with a goal in each half - bets that proved extremely prescient. After a long investigation the allegations of match-fixing were upheld against six players who were banned for up to a year. Also this season, Perugia's coach Serge Cosmi while talking in a TV studio before an interview, alleged that the Italian Third Division (in which he was a coach last season) was a giant fix. His remarks were filmed and were later shown. They are now the subject of another investigation.</p> <p>This season has seen another growing area of potential corruption \u00dc footballers failing drugs tests. A fortnight ago Edgar Davids became the latest, and the highest profile player to join the list. The Dutch international and mainstay of the Juventus midfield tested positive for the steroid nandrolone after a sample was taken following a game in early March. Davids insists he is innocent and the authorities are awaiting the result of a second test before deciding on what action to take.</p> <p>Already this season four Serie A players (and one from Serie B) have been confirmed as failing tests, including Lazio's Portuguese international defender Fernando Couto, who was suspended 10 days ago, prior to being sentenced by the Italian Olympic Committee on Tuesday. Two players are already serving 16-month bans. There has been much talk among players about dietary supplements and better supervision of the use of prescription medicines, but a more sinister assessment of football's drugs culture came from former Parma coach Nevio Scala. 'It's a nonsense to say nobody is guilty,' he said. 'At the crucial time of the season, when results are decisive and players tired, there are people who are prepared to act incorrectly and administer forbidden substances.' </p> <p>A couple of years ago the former Roma and Napoli coach Zdenek Zeman caused outrage with his claim that doping was rife in Italian football. In total, eight players have now failed drugs tests since random screening was introduced, while a further 67 are under investigation by the Turin public prosecutor's office. The response of Italian clubs? To try to raise the level of nandrolone allowed in a player's bloodstream before a test is deemed positive - a move rejected by the Italian football association who insisted on adhering to the limits recommended by Fifa.</p> <p>Once again calcio is left looking sleazy. The same could be said for the country. Transparency International, a non-governmental agency, ranks Italy's corruption on a par with the Third World. Silvio Berlusconi, the billionaire opposition leader and likely Prime Minister, is sought by a Spanish court on suspicion of bribery. Football's failure to buck the trend diffuses moral pollution through Serie A. If clubs flout the rules why shouldn't fans? It is a sentiment that threads racism, violence and corruption into a vicious circle.</p> <p> Churning beneath the surface of Italian football's problems is a deeper explanation. Alienation. According to the ultras, greed has swept away a golden age when officials, players and fans were united in love of their club, a bond that would last even in dark years of relegation. Satellite television's lucre has turned officials into entrepreneurs and players into mercenaries. Only the fans have stayed true.</p> <p>So goes the mythology. The ultras see clubs enriching players and officials while hiking ticket prices. They see clubs negotiating huge sponsorship deals and refusing to subsidise away travel. They see clubs selling iconic players despite furious protests. They see betrayal. Throughout Serie A the theme recurs. Fans are the keepers of the flame, defenders of the faith. It is their duty to safeguard the club's integrity, with violence if necessary. </p> <p>The next few weeks will decide who wins the title. Roma have led for most of the season: can they hold their nerve in the face of Juve's impressive late surge? But in many ways it doesn't matter who wins. No amount of passion and skill can cover the fact that this season everybody has lost.</p> <p>Back on the Curva Nord, Marco expresses the view of many. 'The league stinks,' he says bitterly. 'You can smell the rot.'</p> <p><strong>Italian football violence: a season of savagery</strong></p> <p><strong>October 2000</strong></p> <p><strong>Piacenza v Atalanta </strong><br> A riot breaks out at Piacenza train station.

      "bodyText": "In mid-December last year, following a humiliating cup defeat, an enraged Inter fan threw a Molotov cocktail outside the San Siro stadium. This was significant for two reasons. First because it suggested a disturbing level of preparation. And second because of the incendiary's intended victims. It hit and damaged the coach carrying the Inter team, in other words the highly priced players the Inter fans cheer every week. Marco Tardelli, the coach, was one of many on board badly shaken by the attack. 'I just cannot accept this type of violence bursting its way into football,' he said. 'After the Heysel disaster, this is the worst that's ever happened to me in football. Next thing they'll be shooting at us from the grandstand.' The firebomb was just one example of an escalating crisis, with a huge increase in the number of violent incidents(see panel). One disturbing trend has been the proliferation of attacks by supporters on their own team or team officials, whether it be Roma fans ambushing players arriving at the Trigoria training ground, Brescia supporters smashing the window of a car carrying their club president's daughter, Pescara forced to train under police protection, Reggina president Pasquale Foti receiving a severed calf's head in the post, or Napoli ultras lobbing a bomb into the garden of the club's part-owner Corrado Ferlaino. Not that the violence has been limited to fans turning on their own. In some towns and cities it has become almost routine with railway and bus stations hosting battles between rival supporters. Three Serie A clubs - Napoli, Reggina and Vicenza \u00dc have been ordered to play home games away from their own stadium this season as a punishment for their fans' violent behaviour. To an extent the increasing violence can be traced to the same dynamic as the increased racism: orchestration by politically motivated infiltrators. But there are other causes. Some are banal: an early season clash between rivals almost guarantees a revenge cycle. The police, too, are often the intended victims; indeed, for many ultras the police \u00dc as the embodiment of authority - are the primary target. 'They want to stop me doing what I want to do,' Lorenzo, the head of the Roma ultras told Channel Four. 'So I must react violently. That's what the young guys in the curva think. The Curva is a territory that the ultras must defend.' Sometimes opposition fans are deliberately attacked to provoke the police. Friends of a badly beaten Roma fan vowed revenge at the next match - which happened to be against Liverpool. According to one ultra, Liverpool supporters were stabbed solely to draw in police. It worked. Bottles, stones and petrol bombs rained down as soon as they arrived. Giuliano Zincone, the Corriere della Sera columnist, provides an almost Hobbesian analysis of the racism and violence, with football providing a safety valve for a society of base, violent instincts. 'The sports stadium is the only, and perhaps the last remaining place where extreme, cruel, dirty and primitive feelings are expressed,' he writes. 'It is the open-air catacomb for the barbaric custom of wishing the greatest possible misfortune on one's rivals, cast as infidels. That's the way it is. There is, and long has been, a minority that likes to go to the stadium in order to shout disgusting slogans, to vent hostility and give voice to the aggression and antagonism that are prohibited elsewhere. 'Many people go to the stadium for the specific purpose of \"offending\". Unleashing the spirit of rebellion and complete antagonism is part of the modern soccer stadium just as cruelty was part of the operational functions of the Roman Colosseum. In the stadium, verbal violence can serve as a proxy for real violence. 'The stadium is the platform for an almost religious and warlike devotion to one's favourite team... the vile banners do not, as a rule, express actual political inclinations, but reflect a vague desire to \"be somewhere else\", to seek direct conflicts rather than languish constantly in the bland repression and pacifications required by everyday collective life. 'Cruel sentiments exist and perhaps it is better to contain them, to let them shout themselves out in stadiums, than to prohibit them there and find them cropping up again, ominously, in city streets and squares.' 'Only suckers stick to the rules if the game is rigged,' writes a Juventus fan on an ultra website. It is a refrain heard all over Italy. Rumours of Serie A corruption surface weekly, fuelling a sense that the league operates above the law. The revelation that Lazio's Argentine star midfielder Juan Veron had a forged Italian passport shocked the league. Dozens of clubs and foreign players are under investigation for allegedly faking documents and inventing Italian ancestors to circumvent limits on non-European Union players. Prodded into action by Fifa, the Italian federation has yet to reach conclusions but stars such as Inter's Uruguayan forward Alvaro Recoba are unlikely to emerge unscathed. Time will tell whether the villains were players, agents or clubs. All protest their innocence. Italy is not the only country tarnished by the passports scandal \u00dc but only Italy could come up with the Night of the Watches. Gold Rolexes given by Roma to referees were returned lest the 'Christmas presents' conveyed the wrong impression. A federation inquiry flushed out expensive offerings from other clubs, such as holidays paid by Juventus. 'Where does the fine line between a kind gift and a bribe lie?' asked Corriere della Sera. The perception that Serie A's referees are on the take is widespread, the image of it as a corrupt league, long lasting and difficult to shift. A year ago as the Serie A title built toa nail-bitingly close climax, Juventus benefited from an extraordinary piece of refereeing against Parma. A last-minute equaliser was inexplicably disallowed, giving Juve a dubious and vital victory with one week of the season left. A tidal wave of anti-Juve feeling swept Italy including a street 'funeral for Italian football' and the front page headline on the Corriere dello Sport, 'Sorry, but this is a scandal'. (Juventus lost their final game and the championship went to Lazio after all.) This was in the same season that an Italian Serie A player wrote a letter to the Catholic magazine Famiglia Cristiana claiming he was bribed to lose a match. The magazine rebuffed magistrates' inquiries, saying its letters column was akin to a confessional. Juve have been accused before. Three years ago the 'season of poison' culminated in a controversial game in which Inter were denied a blatant penalty. 'Referees don't do this on purpose,' raged the Inter president Massimo Moratti, 'it's a habit. They are afraid of hurting Juventus. It is the rule, not the exception.' The former Italian international Roberto Mancini went a lot further, saying 'the last fair championship was won in 1991 by Sampdoria'. This season has seen new match-fixing scandals. A cup match between Atlanta and Pistoiese provoked much interest after a rush of inspired bets that the game would end 1-1, with a goal in each half - bets that proved extremely prescient. After a long investigation the allegations of match-fixing were upheld against six players who were banned for up to a year. Also this season, Perugia's coach Serge Cosmi while talking in a TV studio before an interview, alleged that the Italian Third Division (in which he was a coach last season) was a giant fix. His remarks were filmed and were later shown. They are now the subject of another investigation. This season has seen another growing area of potential corruption \u00dc footballers failing drugs tests. A fortnight ago Edgar Davids became the latest, and the highest profile player to join the list. The Dutch international and mainstay of the Juventus midfield tested positive for the steroid nandrolone after a sample was taken following a game in early March. Davids insists he is innocent and the authorities are awaiting the result of a second test before deciding on what action to take. Already this season four Serie A players (and one from Serie B) have been confirmed as failing tests, including Lazio's Portuguese international defender Fernando Couto, who was suspended 10 days ago, prior to being sentenced by the Italian Olympic Committee on Tuesday. Two players are already serving 16-month bans. There has been much talk among players about dietary supplements and better supervision of the use of prescription medicines, but a more sinister assessment of football's drugs culture came from former Parma coach Nevio Scala. 'It's a nonsense to say nobody is guilty,' he said. 'At the crucial time of the season, when results are decisive and players tired, there are people who are prepared to act incorrectly and administer forbidden substances.' A couple of years ago the former Roma and Napoli coach Zdenek Zeman caused outrage with his claim that doping was rife in Italian football. In total, eight players have now failed drugs tests since random screening was introduced, while a further 67 are under investigation by the Turin public prosecutor's office. The response of Italian clubs? To try to raise the level of nandrolone allowed in a player's bloodstream before a test is deemed positive - a move rejected by the Italian football association who insisted on adhering to the limits recommended by Fifa. Once again calcio is left looking sleazy. The same could be said for the country. Transparency International, a non-governmental agency, ranks Italy's corruption on a par with the Third World. Silvio Berlusconi, the billionaire opposition leader and likely Prime Minister, is sought by a Spanish court on suspicion of bribery. Football's failure to buck the trend diffuses moral pollution through Serie A. If clubs flout the rules why shouldn't fans? It is a sentiment that threads racism, violence and corruption into a vicious circle. Churning beneath the surface of Italian football's problems is a deeper explanation. Alienation. According to the ultras, greed has swept away a golden age when officials, players and fans were united in love of their club, a bond that would last even in dark years of relegation. Satellite television's lucre has turned officials into entrepreneurs and players into mercenaries. Only the fans have stayed true. So goes the mythology. The ultras see clubs enriching players and officials while hiking ticket prices. They see clubs negotiating huge sponsorship deals and refusing to subsidise away travel. They see clubs selling iconic players despite furious protests. They see betrayal. Throughout Serie A the theme recurs. Fans are the keepers of the flame, defenders of the faith. It is their duty to safeguard the club's integrity, with violence if necessary. The next few weeks will decide who wins the title. Roma have led for most of the season: can they hold their nerve in the face of Juve's impressive late surge? But in many ways it doesn't matter who wins. No amount of passion and skill can cover the fact that this season everybody has lost. Back on the Curva Nord, Marco expresses the view of many. 'The league stinks,' he says bitterly. 'You can smell the rot.' Italian football violence: a season of savagery October 2000 Piacenza v Atalanta A riot breaks out at Piacenza train station. Objects are thrown out of the train window, including a bicycle. Ten policemen are injured. Napoli v Bologna Napoli fans inside the stadium throw objects at the police, who try to calm things using tear gas, which drifts onto the pitch, halting the match. The riot continues outside the stadium. Two policemen are injured and a fan is hit by a homemade bomb. Milan v Juventus A Milan fan throws a flare into the Juve section during the match. Police intervene as Juve fans become aggressive. Milan fans throw flares, fruit and bottles throughout the match. November Reggina v Brescia Reggina fans force the game to be abandoned by throwing objects onto the field. These fans, including the son of San Angelo de Lombardi's archbishop, have been banned for a year. Como v Modena In a post-match brawl Como's Massimo Ferrigno knocks Modena midfielder Francesco Bertolotti to the ground, putting him in a coma that lasts eight days. Ferrigno has been banned until the end of 2003. Bertolotti still requires a number of operations. December Fan attacks owner A Napoli fan throws a bomb into the garden of the club's co-owner Corrado Ferlaino in reaction to the club's poor start to the season. Inter v Parma Inter's team bus is attacked by a fan, who throws a petrol-bomb at players sat aboard the bus. The device bounces off the window and explodes in the street. Inter v Juventus Juventus fans throw chairs and rocks at the police after the match, a 2-2 draw. Police are forced to use tear gas until back-up arrives to help restore order. January 2001 Lazio v Napoli Lazio fans throw stones at Napoli supporters' buses and police baton-charge Napoli fans inside the stadium. Six police officers and 11 fans require hospital treatment, including a Napoli fan stabbed in the thigh . Milan v Roma Police fight with Roma fans for 15 minutes after the match. Fans throw flares and rip out seats. The police respond by using batons to drive back the supporters and finally restore order with heavy use of tear gas. February 2001 Pisa v La Spezia La Spezia fans set fire to seats inside Pisa's ground and throw them onto the pitch. One of them hits the Pisa goalkeeper. Police fight with travelling fans throughout the game. Twelve people are injured. Atalanta v Vicenza Two policemen are injured by a firecracker thrown by a Vicenza fan. One policeman, who tried to catch the firecracker in an attempt to protect supporters from injury, badly burns his hand and has to have a finger amputated. Foggia v Tricase The game is suspended after 87 minutes when a firecracker is thrown onto the pitch. Cars are damaged by Foggia supporters, who had earlier tried to invade the dressing rooms. March 2001 Brescia v Lazio Disgruntled Brescia fans hurl glasses, newspapers and stones at officials after a home defeat.",

A feast for the irriducibili.</p> <p>Racism, hatred, violence, corruption: welcome to Serie A, Italy's Premiership. Once upon a time this was where the beautiful game was at its most beautiful. Once upon a time this was, Italians prided themselves, the most glamorous league in the world - and the best. No longer. Today the face of Italian football is bruised, contorted and ugly. The league's reputation is in tatters - and for reasons far more fundamental and disturbing than the poor recent record of its clubs in European competition. </p> <p>A malaise has engulfed calcio this season. There have been ambushes, stabbings and beatings as violence has spilled from the stadiums into cities with ultras (the hard-core fans) turning Serie A, B and C into battlefields. There have been attacks on players by their own supporters, a trend that has included besieged dressing rooms, assaults on players' relatives and a firebomb attack on a team bus. There has been widespread evidence of corruption, from match-fixing and bribery, to positive dope tests and dodgy passports. Finally there has been the exposure to a disbelieving and disgusted international audience of an apparently endemic malicious racism among both fans and players that is all but tolerated in Italy itself.</p> <p>Last autumn the Arsenal midfielder Patrick Vieira and his black team-mates were subjected to sustained abuse during their Champions League game in Rome, and not just from Lazio's notoriously racist fans. The Yugoslav defender Sinisa Mihajlovic repeatedly called Vieira a nigger. Vieira spoke of a 'racist atmosphere that you can almost breathe' and in the aftermath Uefa were swift to punish Mihajlovic with a two-match ban while his club forced him to apologise publicly, a microphone in his hand, shortly before the kick-off of Lazio's next Champions League fixture, against Shakhtar Donetsk. </p> <p>Lazio's coach Dino Zoff was relaxed about the shoddy incident. Cursing during matches, he said, was unfortunate, but went on all the time. Last season, when the club had been fined after fans barracked Venezia's black defender Bruno N'Gotty, Zoff, the most capped player in Italian history and a former national team coach, had been even less concerned. 'I don't know whether you could really call that racism,' he said. 'It's more a question of people making fun. Fans pick on someone tall, short, grey-haired.' </p> <p>Zoff's response then was echoed in the ambivalent attitude across Italy to Mihajlovic's verbal assault on Vieira. And within minutes of hearing Mihajlovic's apology combined with an appeal for tolerance, Lazio's fans produced their own response. When Shakhtar's Nigerian centre-half Izek Okoronkwo got his first touch the grunting began again. (A few weeks later it was Emile Heskey's turn during an England-Italy friendly in Turin, an incident that prompted FA protests.)</p> <p>Italy's football officials say things are not so bad, that problems are exaggerated and temporary. A journey through Serie A suggests the opposite. The problems are that bad and getting worse. They are also connected. Racism, violence and corruption feed off each other.</p> <p>If mentioned at all, racism is usually buried far down the match report, a single sentence about a black player being barracked every time he touched the ball. As sure as the whistle blows every Sunday players will be vilified for the colour of their skin. On that night's football chat shows, marathons of analysis and opinion, there is rarely a mention. A stadium resounding to booh-booh-booh is not a shock, not a scandal, it is merely there. </p> <p>It carries with it an echo of English football 25 years ago, when black footballers could be greeted by monkey noises and bananas thrown from the terraces. But even then the abuse was not so vicious and the disease not so widespread - or so acceptable. Because in Italy today it's not just skinheads who are doing it. At January's Lazio-Inter match, Michael Fanizadeh, a coordinator of Football Against Racism in Europe, was shocked to see women and children hurling abuse. And those fans who do not join in sometimes grimace, sometimes smirk, but mostly look as if they don't hear anything. Maybe they don't. Maybe the taunting is so routine they no longer notice. </p> <p>Except no one believes that. It is impossible to be unaware of the ritual. From Udine to Verona, Brescia to Rome, Naples to Bari, it zig-zags down the peninsula, relaying an unmistakable message: racism is tolerated. The nation watches as abuse rains down on some of the league's greatest footballers - players such as Edgar Davids of Juventus, Lilian Thuram and Patrik Mboma of Parma, and Clarence Seedorf of Internazionale -and the nation does nothing about it. Prejudice bubbles openly. In January Verona, who have struggled all season, were linked with a move for the highly rated Mboma, the African Player of the Year. The deal fell through. 'You need to draw your own conclusions,' the Verona president, Giambattista Pastorello, said. 'If you have fans that do these things you need to have patience.' (The club later insisted that of course Pastorello did not mean to say racists could veto signings.)</p> <p>And it's not just fans. In February last year Torino's Senegalese defender Djibril Diawara had his nose smashed while playing Bari. With blood pouring from his face, Diawara confronted Luigi Garzya, Bari's captain. This was too much for Bari's coach, Eugenio Fascetti, who shouted: 'The nigger Diawara spat in Garzya's face! And the spit might even be infected! Why don't they just stay home, these niggers?' Fascetti later said he had missed his player's elbowing of Diawara and withdrew his statement. To heap salt onto the wound, Diawara received a four-match ban for spitting, while Garzya, a white Italian, received only a one-match ban for pushing him in the face.</p> <p>Not that racism is a particularly recent development in Italian football. The formation of the ultras dates back to the late Sixties. At the time they found their inspiration from England and adopted English habits such as scarves and chanting. But there was also one Italian habit. Politics. In tune with those rebellious times, the ultras reflected political rivalries: Lazio were of the Right, for instance, while their great rivals Roma were communists. In those early days they even displayed the same banners that had been used in political demonstrations, turning them over and putting football slogans on the back. </p> <p>These days, however, the relationship between politics and football has been turned on its head: political rallies no longer lead to riots, so football has become the most promising outlet for those itching for a fight. And, as the ultras have become more uniformly right-wing, there have been orchestrated attempts by the hard Right to infiltrate and use football to recruit members - though even that may simplify the phenomenon. Maurizio Marinelli, director of the Study Centre for Public Security, has identified three types of infiltration. The Right have targeted Lazio, Verona, Fiorentina and Inter, infusing a xenophobic, anti-Semitic agenda. Left-wing militants have targeted Livorno, Modena, Ternana and Genoa. They are less ideological but want to rebel. And finally there is an embryonic third category, a misanthropic movement called Loma which is trying to inject nihilistic individualism into Torino, Lazio, Genoa and Verona. In such ways have cities with relatively good race relations, such as Verona and Bari, acquired racist fans.</p> <p>Sometimes there is even a quasi-official tone to Italy's racism. During a 1997 trip to Poland, the Italian national squad refused to accompany federation officials on a visit to Auschwitz. A journalist who wrote the story was threatened. Meanwhile Gianluigi Buffon, the Italian national goalkeeper, has worn a T-shirt sporting the fascist slogan, 'Death to those who surrender'. Buffon, who plays for Parma in Serie A, also raised a few eyebrows last year when he picked 88 as his shirt number for the new season. The decision upset Italy's Jewish community, which pointed out that the figure is sometimes used as a neo-Nazi symbol - 'H' is the eighth letter of the alphabet, so 88 equates to HH, or Heil Hitler. Buffon denied any knowledge of the link, claiming: 'I have chosen 88 because it reminds me of four balls and in Italy we all know what it means to have balls: strength and determination.' He later changed his number to 77. When Dutch defender Aron Winter signed for Lazio in 1992, graffiti appeared welcoming the 'nigger Jew' to the club. The pea-brained authors clearly had not noticed that the player's middle name is Mohammed.</p> <p>And then there are the banners - Celtic crosses, swastikas, slogans. Some are 50m long - 'Auschwitz is your town, the ovens your houses' - or a more modest 40m - 'Honour to the Tiger Arkan'. Death camps, Serb war criminals, anything goes. </p> <p>When interviewed, which isn't often, black players admit to feeling isolated but tend to keep their heads down. There are very few black Italian players, though Fabio Liverani made history a couple of weeks ago by becoming the first black player to represent Italy when he made his international debut in a friendly match with South Africa. Matteo Ferrari, a black Italian who plays for Internazionale, would not identify an abusive opponent to La Repubblica. 'It was all finished after 90 minutes,' he said. 'The player in question asked for my forgiveness.' Clarence Seedorf, a team-mate of Ferrari, said his white team-mates rarely discuss the chanting. 'When these things happen I don't feel offended. I think with sadness of those people, of their education, which must be very low,' he said. In some respects he is right. Some fans are too ignorant or immature to distinguish between monkey noise and the abuse hurled at white players and rival fans. After all, bad taste is the leitmotif: burn the South, shit you are and shit you'll stay, cat eaters, earthquake victims, Juliet is a whore. </p> <p>Some positive steps have been taken. Roma and Lazio officials visited a synagogue and up and down the country players sported kit with anti-racist slogans on 22 October. Stiffer penalties have reduced the number of offensive banners. Ultras have appointed stewards. </p> <p>But, by any standards, the response is inadequate. Calcio's defenders usually argue that football merely reflects racism in society, which is where the cause and cure lie. They have a point. Racism has risen sharply since immigration sprinkled black and brown faces in what until 10 years ago had been an almost all-white population. Unemployment and crime are falling yet xenophobia spreads. Opinion polls show the arrivals are blamed for crime, disease and poaching jobs. Right-wing extremist groups have sprouted in many cities. </p> <p>On 13 May, the centre-right is expected to win a general election on a platform of cracking down on migration. The Northern League, part of the centre-right, now bashes illegal immigrants instead of southern Italians. Calcio inevitably absorbs these influences but some believe it performs a service by allowing racists to ventilate. 'Perhaps it is better to let them shout themselves out in stadiums than to prohibit them and find them cropping up again, ominously, in city streets,' said Giuliano Zincone, a Corrierre della Sera columnist.</p> <p>Enzo Bianco, the Interior Minister, thinks stadiums legitimise racism. Whether as a consequence non-white immigrants are more or less likely to be beaten up is impossible to say. But the galvanising effect on the extreme Right is undeniable. Fabrizio, an irriducibili leader, said the stadium had become the only place to express right-wing views. Groups like MS-Fiamma Tricolore and Forza Nuova rely on matches for publicity and recruitment. 'The stadium is an aspect of the social fabric where we conduct our politics,' says Roberto Fiore, the London-based head of Forza Nuova.</p> <p>Paolo, the chunky skinhead who pushed to the front of the irriducibili, was a member. Marco, the trainee accountant, was not. He joined in the salute for the hell of it. Paolo's job is to nurture Marco.</p> <p>Yet no politician, club or player has emerged to consistently champion anti-racism. The typical response is silence. As a result no country in Europe comes close to the frequency, viciousness and openness of the racism to be found in Italy's football. </p> <p>Unlike Dino Zoff, the issue clearly upsets Arrigo Sacchi, one of Zoff's predecessors as national coach. 'We have the least habitable, the most uncivilised and poorly educated stadiums in the world,' Sacchi said. 'The sporting culture here is broadly deficient.'</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/osm/story/0,6903,481536,00.html\">Read the second part of this article here</a></p>",

Last autumn the Arsenal midfielder Patrick Vieira and his black team-mates were subjected to sustained abuse during their Champions League game in Rome, and not just from Lazio's notoriously racist fans. The Yugoslav defender Sinisa Mihajlovic repeatedly called Vieira a nigger. Vieira spoke of a 'racist atmosphere that you can almost breathe' and in the aftermath Uefa were swift to punish Mihajlovic with a two-match ban while his club forced him to apologise publicly, a microphone in his hand, shortly before the kick-off of Lazio's next Champions League fixture, against Shakhtar Donetsk. Lazio's coach Dino Zoff was relaxed about the shoddy incident. Cursing during matches, he said, was unfortunate, but went on all the time. Last season, when the club had been fined after fans barracked Venezia's black defender Bruno N'Gotty, Zoff, the most capped player in Italian history and a former national team coach, had been even less concerned. 'I don't know whether you could really call that racism,' he said. 'It's more a question of people making fun. Fans pick on someone tall, short, grey-haired.' Zoff's response then was echoed in the ambivalent attitude across Italy to Mihajlovic's verbal assault on Vieira. And within minutes of hearing Mihajlovic's apology combined with an appeal for tolerance, Lazio's fans produced their own response. When Shakhtar's Nigerian centre-half Izek Okoronkwo got his first touch the grunting began again. (A few weeks later it was Emile Heskey's turn during an England-Italy friendly in Turin, an incident that prompted FA protests.) Italy's football officials say things are not so bad, that problems are exaggerated and temporary. A journey through Serie A suggests the opposite. The problems are that bad and getting worse. They are also connected. Racism, violence and corruption feed off each other. If mentioned at all, racism is usually buried far down the match report, a single sentence about a black player being barracked every time he touched the ball. As sure as the whistle blows every Sunday players will be vilified for the colour of their skin. On that night's football chat shows, marathons of analysis and opinion, there is rarely a mention. A stadium resounding to booh-booh-booh is not a shock, not a scandal, it is merely there. It carries with it an echo of English football 25 years ago, when black footballers could be greeted by monkey noises and bananas thrown from the terraces. But even then the abuse was not so vicious and the disease not so widespread - or so acceptable. Because in Italy today it's not just skinheads who are doing it. At January's Lazio-Inter match, Michael Fanizadeh, a coordinator of Football Against Racism in Europe, was shocked to see women and children hurling abuse. And those fans who do not join in sometimes grimace, sometimes smirk, but mostly look as if they don't hear anything. Maybe they don't. Maybe the taunting is so routine they no longer notice. Except no one believes that. It is impossible to be unaware of the ritual. From Udine to Verona, Brescia to Rome, Naples to Bari, it zig-zags down the peninsula, relaying an unmistakable message: racism is tolerated. The nation watches as abuse rains down on some of the league's greatest footballers - players such as Edgar Davids of Juventus, Lilian Thuram and Patrik Mboma of Parma, and Clarence Seedorf of Internazionale -and the nation does nothing about it. Prejudice bubbles openly. In January Verona, who have struggled all season, were linked with a move for the highly rated Mboma, the African Player of the Year. The deal fell through. 'You need to draw your own conclusions,' the Verona president, Giambattista Pastorello, said. 'If you have fans that do these things you need to have patience.' (The club later insisted that of course Pastorello did not mean to say racists could veto signings.) And it's not just fans. In February last year Torino's Senegalese defender Djibril Diawara had his nose smashed while playing Bari. With blood pouring from his face, Diawara confronted Luigi Garzya, Bari's captain. This was too much for Bari's coach, Eugenio Fascetti, who shouted: 'The nigger Diawara spat in Garzya's face! And the spit might even be infected! Why don't they just stay home, these niggers?' Fascetti later said he had missed his player's elbowing of Diawara and withdrew his statement. To heap salt onto the wound, Diawara received a four-match ban for spitting, while Garzya, a white Italian, received only a one-match ban for pushing him in the face. Not that racism is a particularly recent development in Italian football. The formation of the ultras dates back to the late Sixties. At the time they found their inspiration from England and adopted English habits such as scarves and chanting. But there was also one Italian habit. Politics. In tune with those rebellious times, the ultras reflected political rivalries: Lazio were of the Right, for instance, while their great rivals Roma were communists. In those early days they even displayed the same banners that had been used in political demonstrations, turning them over and putting football slogans on the back. These days, however, the relationship between politics and football has been turned on its head: political rallies no longer lead to riots, so football has become the most promising outlet for those itching for a fight. And, as the ultras have become more uniformly right-wing, there have been orchestrated attempts by the hard Right to infiltrate and use football to recruit members - though even that may simplify the phenomenon. Maurizio Marinelli, director of the Study Centre for Public Security, has identified three types of infiltration. The Right have targeted Lazio, Verona, Fiorentina and Inter, infusing a xenophobic, anti-Semitic agenda. Left-wing militants have targeted Livorno, Modena, Ternana and Genoa. They are less ideological but want to rebel. And finally there is an embryonic third category, a misanthropic movement called Loma which is trying to inject nihilistic individualism into Torino, Lazio, Genoa and Verona. In such ways have cities with relatively good race relations, such as Verona and Bari, acquired racist fans. Sometimes there is even a quasi-official tone to Italy's racism. During a 1997 trip to Poland, the Italian national squad refused to accompany federation officials on a visit to Auschwitz. A journalist who wrote the story was threatened. Meanwhile Gianluigi Buffon, the Italian national goalkeeper, has worn a T-shirt sporting the fascist slogan, 'Death to those who surrender'. Buffon, who plays for Parma in Serie A, also raised a few eyebrows last year when he picked 88 as his shirt number for the new season. The decision upset Italy's Jewish community, which pointed out that the figure is sometimes used as a neo-Nazi symbol - 'H' is the eighth letter of the alphabet, so 88 equates to HH, or Heil Hitler. Buffon denied any knowledge of the link, claiming: 'I have chosen 88 because it reminds me of four balls and in Italy we all know what it means to have balls: strength and determination.' He later changed his number to 77. When Dutch defender Aron Winter signed for Lazio in 1992, graffiti appeared welcoming the 'nigger Jew' to the club. The pea-brained authors clearly had not noticed that the player's middle name is Mohammed. And then there are the banners - Celtic crosses, swastikas, slogans. Some are 50m long - 'Auschwitz is your town, the ovens your houses' - or a more modest 40m - 'Honour to the Tiger Arkan'. Death camps, Serb war criminals, anything goes. When interviewed, which isn't often, black players admit to feeling isolated but tend to keep their heads down. There are very few black Italian players, though Fabio Liverani made history a couple of weeks ago by becoming the first black player to represent Italy when he made his international debut in a friendly match with South Africa. Matteo Ferrari, a black Italian who plays for Internazionale, would not identify an abusive opponent to La Repubblica. 'It was all finished after 90 minutes,' he said. 'The player in question asked for my forgiveness.' Clarence Seedorf, a team-mate of Ferrari, said his white team-mates rarely discuss the chanting. 'When these things happen I don't feel offended. I think with sadness of those people, of their education, which must be very low,' he said. In some respects he is right. Some fans are too ignorant or immature to distinguish between monkey noise and the abuse hurled at white players and rival fans. After all, bad taste is the leitmotif: burn the South, shit you are and shit you'll stay, cat eaters, earthquake victims, Juliet is a whore. Some positive steps have been taken. Roma and Lazio officials visited a synagogue and up and down the country players sported kit with anti-racist slogans on 22 October. Stiffer penalties have reduced the number of offensive banners. Ultras have appointed stewards. But, by any standards, the response is inadequate. Calcio's defenders usually argue that football merely reflects racism in society, which is where the cause and cure lie. They have a point. Racism has risen sharply since immigration sprinkled black and brown faces in what until 10 years ago had been an almost all-white population. Unemployment and crime are falling yet xenophobia spreads. Opinion polls show the arrivals are blamed for crime, disease and poaching jobs. Right-wing extremist groups have sprouted in many cities. On 13 May, the centre-right is expected to win a general election on a platform of cracking down on migration. The Northern League, part of the centre-right, now bashes illegal immigrants instead of southern Italians. Calcio inevitably absorbs these influences but some believe it performs a service by allowing racists to ventilate. 'Perhaps it is better to let them shout themselves out in stadiums than to prohibit them and find them cropping up again, ominously, in city streets,' said Giuliano Zincone, a Corrierre della Sera columnist. Enzo Bianco, the Interior Minister, thinks stadiums legitimise racism. Whether as a consequence non-white immigrants are more or less likely to be beaten up is impossible to say. But the galvanising effect on the extreme Right is undeniable. Fabrizio, an irriducibili leader, said the stadium had become the only place to express right-wing views. Groups like MS-Fiamma Tricolore and Forza Nuova rely on matches for publicity and recruitment. 'The stadium is an aspect of the social fabric where we conduct our politics,' says Roberto Fiore, the London-based head of Forza Nuova. Paolo, the chunky skinhead who pushed to the front of the irriducibili, was a member. Marco, the trainee accountant, was not. He joined in the salute for the hell of it. Paolo's job is to nurture Marco. Yet no politician, club or player has emerged to consistently champion anti-racism. The typical response is silence. As a result no country in Europe comes close to the frequency, viciousness and openness of the racism to be found in Italy's football. Unlike Dino Zoff, the issue clearly upsets Arrigo Sacchi, one of Zoff's predecessors as national coach. 'We have the least habitable, the most uncivilised and poorly educated stadiums in the world,' Sacchi said. 'The sporting culture here is broadly deficient.'

Only once since his second retirement six years ago has Lester ridden in public, a veterans' race in Australia last November, six days after he had qualified for a state pension. 'Yes, I enjoyed it, and I'd consider doing it again, given the right circumstances. I'd been riding out for William [Haggas, his son-in-law] to get myself into shape, but I wasn't 100 per cent fit. Nowhere near.' His mount, Bay Scenery, finished third. 'The horse was outpaced after 100 yards and got a long way behind,' he says curtly. 'He wanted a lot further.' Piggott returned to the unsaddling enclosure with a face like a thundercloud; winning has been the haemoglobin of his life. </p> <p>The generous room, furnished in shades as sober as its owner, would be sombre from the gloom outside but for the kaleidoscope of colour on the walls \u00dc paintings, prints, photographs, a gallery of glory celebrating a career that yielded a record 30 Classic winners, including nine Derbies. </p> <p>A new Flat season has begun, but the cream of the crop are unlikely to match last year's superb vintage. For a few hours last August Dubai Millennium and Montjeu, two horses fast enough to dominate any year, were destined for a $10m match.'It was a great year,' Piggott says, 'and if the two horses had met somewhere in July, Montjeu would have had a chance. Then Dubai Millennium broke down, and I thought Montjeu was never quite the same after his injury in the autumn. It was sad to see him beaten, but they do get beat, don't they?' </p> <p>Giant's Causeway, another outstanding horse from last season, also took Piggott's fancy. 'He was very tough. In some ways he reminded me of The Minstrel [on whom Piggott won the 1977 Derby], beaten in the Guineas but he went on to win all those good races.'</p> <p>Piggott was impressed. But not that impressed. 'Yes, they were top horses,' says the man probably best qualified to make historical judgments about the true qualities of British racehorses, 'but I really don't think they were any better than the ones I rode.' Indeed none of last year's champions qualifies as the best horse Piggott has seen since his retirement. That honour goes to the dynamic French horse, Peintre Celebre. 'On the day he landed the Arc in 1997, breaking the track record, he was really outstanding.'</p> <p>Piggott won three Prix de l'Arc de Triomphes, the first on Rheingold in 1973. 'The mile and a half course at Longchamp is one of the hardest in the world to ride. You get a number of half turns before you get to the straight, which is relatively short.' His other two Arc winners came in 1977 and 1978 on Alleged, a horse whose quality still rings down the ages. 'He was one of the best half dozen horses I ever rode.'</p> <p>Looking back, though, Piggott confesses he should have won a fourth Arc, and blames himself for his failure to win on Park Top in 1969. The Duke Of Devonshire's filly flew home in the final furlong, but could not catch the Ascot Gold Cup winner, Levmoss. 'It was my fault. She needed to be held up until the last minute, and I left it too late. If I'd moved sooner I'd have won.'</p> <p>Lester Piggot rode his first winner, The Chase, at Haydock Park in 1948. He was 12 years old. Already a prodigy, the young Piggott was flouting authority long before flared trousers and nostrils assaulted the Sixties. The teenager was by many lengths the most gifted apprentice of his generation, insolently superior to some of the formulaic veterans he encountered, and they resented it. Consequently, he was suspended more times than a chorus girl's stocking. </p> <p>After the King Edward VII Stakes at Royal Ascot of 1954, Piggott was wrongly blamed by the local stewards for causing a scrimmage early in the straight. The stewards of the Jockey Club, bred to stifle precocity, banned him from the racecourse for six months, and demanded that he complete his apprenticeship away from the cocoon of home. Piggott took refuge with Jack Jarvis at Newmarket. </p> <p>'Life was very different then,' Piggott recalls. 'The whole racing world has changed for the better. The stewards have got camera patrols to help them, and everyone's much more aware of safety. When I was young, I didn't want to get beaten and go back with excuses. It was every man for himself. You went out to win. Yes, I did cut up one or two, and them me. But you can't do two things, do your best to win all the time, and be careful all the time.'</p> <p>His disdain for authority, his palpable talent, his election as the people's jockey, made him the 'housewives' favourite'. When as an 18-year-old he landed his first Derby on Never Say Die in 1954, the winner's name celebrated the blitz mentality of a nation barely weened off ration books. A 33-1 outsider, Never Say Die should have been a good result for the bookmakers, but many thousands had backed the boy wonder and in one ride Piggott had captured the hearts and minds of punters up and down the country.</p> <p>His arch opponent throughout his early career was Scobie Breasley, the best jockey to leave Australia. Breasley liked to settle horses, shave the inside rail, challenge late. 'That was his way. It was a good way, but it didn't always pay off. We rode against each other for a long time, and had the pick of the rides. We carved it up between us, really.'</p> <p>In 1961 Piggott married Susan Armstrong, the daughter of trainer Sam Armstrong, and the couple moved to Newmarket. They have never left. Their first house was near Tattersalls' sales arena; they now share a luxury bungalow in Hamilton Road. He lives there with Susan in close proximity to both his elder daughter, Maureen, (who is married to William Haggas) and to Jamie, a son born to his former assistant, Anna Ludlow. </p> <p>Ego drives champions, and ever since Piggott realised that he was the best he has treated the law with steadfast indifference. Regulations - be they on the racetrack, on the road, about paying taxes or in life - are obeyed only if convenient. In one race at Deauville he snatched a whip from Alain Lequeux when his own had gone flying; in another at Sha Tin, he pushed away the head of a persistent challenger with his hand. The inevitable penalties were shrugged off as inconsequential. </p> <p>In 1987 he was given a three-year sentence for tax evasion, of which he served 366 days. Many thought that Piggott, who had travelled Pullman class for most of his life, would be destroyed by the experience. They failed to understand that the taciturn veil he had worn so devotedly to protect him from the public, imposed by partial deafness and a minor speech impediment, proved to be a perfect apprenticeship for the alienation of prison. 'I decided to keep my head down,' he says now, 'keep my nose clean.' The year passed; 'a waste,' he says. He survived, emerging a little softer. </p> <p>Two years before going to jail Piggott had retired and taken up training. At its peak his Eve Lodge stables had housed 97 residents and sent out 34 winners, but on his release he returned home to a handful of horses, and it was not enough. In the autumn of 1990 he returned to what he knew best. Within a few days of his picking up the reins, he landed one of the most prestigious races in America, the Breeders' Cup Mile, at the age of 54. Racing celebrated the return of its fallen idol; he might have been stripped of his OBE, but to the devout congregation it was a second coming, the flair, the drive, the equilibrium seemingly undiminished by the passing of the years. Even the jockey found a smile. </p> <p> He doesn't drop his guard easily, though. Those who thought David Beckham was a trifle timid when interviewed by Ali G for this year's Red Nose Day should try Lester; he makes the England football captain seem as extrovert as John McCririck.</p> <p>If Lester owned a Classic colt, which present day jockey would he engage to ride? 'That's a hard one. I'm not answering that one.'</p> <p>To nominate the most talented horse he rode is, he thinks, to diminish the other champions. He knows, of course, but would rather keep it to himself than offend those he has passed over. Nijinsky, who won the Triple Crown in 1970, was the most charismatic of his champions. The familiar figure of Lester's lean torso balanced against Nijinsky on the bridle was the sight of a lifetime; irons short, reins long, man and horse flowing over the turf in perfect harmony. </p> <p>When most jockeys want their horses to quicken they shorten the reins and start to pump, jack-in-the-box, all action. No jockey could be more severe in a finish than Piggott, but his composure on a thoroughbred galloping at 40 miles an hour was unique. His superior judgment of pace allowed him to challenge at the optimum moment, seemingly without effort, his horse full of running, given the confidence to quicken way from the herd, to confront the unknown. </p> <p>'In terms of raw ability, Nijinsky was probably the best,' he finally concedes. 'He got nervous before his races, and I was always anxious until he had jumped out of the stalls. Then he'd drop the bit and you could put him anywhere in a race. Soon after the King George he got ringworm, and ran in the St Leger, probably before he'd really got over it. It was the Triple Crown and no horse had landed it since Bahram in 1935, so you can understand why they wanted him to go. He won all right, but not as easily as people thought. '</p> <p>By now Nijinsky's reputation had grown beyond peers and punters, and the Irish-trained horse had been adopted by the whole of Europe when he lined up for the Arc in October. Victory would have bestowed immortality and thousands travelled to witness the moment. It was not to be. </p> <p>'The St Leger left its mark,' Piggott reflects. 'He didn't have the same feel at Longchamp. In the straight Sassafras was in the lead and I went after him. We got to the front 100 yards out, but then he went a bit to the left - he hadn't done it before - and Sassafras got back up on the line. At the time it was a catastrophe!'</p> <p>Some 30 years on, he can afford a chuckle. 'Seriously, though, it was disappointing. He was unbeaten in 12 races. Everybody expected so much. The public were disappointed, but so was I. We all wanted him to win and it hurt.' </p> <p>The 1968 Derby winner Sir Ivor remains another favourite. There is a film of his Classic year, still one of the best documentaries on racing, from which two truths emerge: Sir Ivor had a brilliant turn of finishing speed; and he was tough, winning the Laurel Invitation in America at the end of a gruelling season that had begun in a Guineas trial at Ascot seven months earlier. Piggott settled him so successfully at Epsom that the horse was all but asleep by the time the field swept around Tattenham Corner. 'He had a lot of speed, and I wasn't sure he'd get the trip so I held him up on the inside. With two furlongs to go Sandy Barclay was out in front on Connaught and I was still four lengths behind. I pulled him out and asked him to go, but he didn't quicken up straight away. Perhaps I'd got him a bit too relaxed. Then suddenly he just took off, flew, and won easily.' </p> <p>Nijinsky and Sir Ivor were trained in Co Tipperary by Vincent O'Brien, a man as reticent yet as accomplished as Piggott himself. Together they shared nine Classic winners. Piggott's formal association with the demure Irishman began in 1966, ending a long and successful partnership with Noel Murless, the leading postwar trainer in England. Such naked disloyalty affronted a public still nursing a sense of fair play which had long been suffocated by the onslaught of the commercial imperative. They could not understand why Piggott was deserting someone who had provided him with such a regular supply of Classic winners. </p> <p>The Jockey Club held an impotent inquiry, but Piggot simply wanted the freedom to pick and choose the most likely winners; he was the best, he wanted to ride the best. Those who thought his self-interest would bring about his downfall were silenced when he retained his jockeys' championship (one of nine, though it would have been many more if he had been a few pounds lighter). </p> <p>'Noel was a great trainer,' Piggott recalls, 'but many of his owners had their own stallions and mares, and he was sent their stock.' The champions, though, were emerging from the sales rings of Newmarket and Kentucky. Economic power was drifting away from the aristrocracy, who could only watch helplessly as death duties destroyed the wealth which maintained large private studs. The Sport of Kings became a genetic casino for new money. The pools magnate Robert Sangster was spending millions on the progeny of the great stallion Northern Dancer in America and Piggott wanted to ride them. </p> <p>'Noel was extraordinarily kind to horses, not necessarily the way they were all treated in those days. Crepello was a bit lazy, never did more than he had to, but he had tremendous speed. He had fragile tendons and broke down in the summer, but was one of the best horses I ever rode.'</p> <p>Murless rated the ride Piggott gave tough little Carozza to win the 1977 Oaks for the Queen as the best he could recall, but the most memorable filly of their partnership was Petite Etoile. The grey won the 1,000 Guineas, the Oaks, two Coronation Cups and a Champion Stakes; she was never out of the first two in 19 races over four seasons in the Fifites and Sixties, but scarcely lasted a mile and a half. His gossamer rein persuaded the petulant filly that she was barely exerting herself. 'She was a right monkey at the best of times,' was Murless's euphemistic observation, but their combined finesse controlled her temperament. </p> <p>Piggott's light touch could be matched by a shade of violence, and the victory of Roberto in 1972 was the most controversial of his Derbies. Bill Williamson, the colt's regular jockey, was recovering from injury and the owner wanted Piggott to ride. Lester had a reputation for easing his rivals out of the saddle, but, for once, Piggott was wrongly blamed by the press and public. </p> <p>With less than two furlongs to run, Roberto was given a hefty bump by the weakening leader, Pentland Firth, at the same time as being squeezed on his outside by Rheingold, ridden by the lightweight Ernie Johnson. Rheingold was half a length ahead entering the final furlong, and should have won, but he hung into his rival, persistently bumping him.</p> <p>With Rheingold so close, Piggott could not use his whip effectively until well inside the final furlong. Then, with Roberto balanced, Piggott let loose. The crack of his flailing whip cut through the roar of the stands, compelling Roberto to respond. The two exhausted colts flashed across the line eye to eye. </p> <p>'The Minstrel had a hard race in the Derby, when he just got up to beat Willie [Carson] on Hot Grove, but I was harder on Roberto,' Piggott admits. 'I had to win, you know, and he wasn't doing much for me. I felt he could go faster if only he would. When we passed the post I thought I was beat, but I wasn't worried because I was sure I would get the race in the Stewards' Room.' To Lester, Roberto's reluctance justified the ferocity of his ride, one of the greatest in racing, a flagrant imposition of one man's will on history, seared in the memory as surely as an oak scorched by lightning. </p> <p>In public, Piggott's temperament remained equable throughout a career peppered with injuries, with death threats, with physical deprivation. At over 5ft 7in tall, he has spent most of his life weighing 8st 4lb, two stones light, riding daily on little more nourishment than the famous regime of small coffees and large cigars. In retirement he likes ice cream, but still watches his weight. The lizard-lined face of his fifties is fuller now, the skin softer, easing the labyrinth of wrinkles. </p> <p>Most days at Newmarket he calls into the Somerville Lodge stables of his son-in-law, in which he owns shares in four horses, the useful handicapper Royal Artist, and three two-year-olds, Horoscope, Prima Diva and La Perla. Last season his syndicate's colours were carried to victory by Superstar Leo in the Norfolk Stakes at Royal Ascot, the meeting at which he rode 114 winners. The owners sold their filly, prematurely as it transpired, but you can bet that Lester made a substantial profit. </p> <p>He has always hated the cold, and in winter travels widely with his wife Susan. Over forty years their marriage has been tempered from passion to devotion by the flames of fame and shame. The man who was born on Guy Fawkes' Day may no longer burst into an explosion of colour and power on flying thoroughbreds, but never has he seemed so content.</p> <p><strong>Piggott on</strong></p> <p><strong>His reputation for ruthlessness</strong><br> 'When I was young, I didn't want to get beaten and go back with excuses.

Only once since his second retirement six years ago has Lester ridden in public, a veterans' race in Australia last November, six days after he had qualified for a state pension. 'Yes, I enjoyed it, and I'd consider doing it again, given the right circumstances. I'd been riding out for William [Haggas, his son-in-law] to get myself into shape, but I wasn't 100 per cent fit.

In 1961 Piggott married Susan Armstrong, the daughter of trainer Sam Armstrong, and the couple moved to Newmarket. They have never left. Their first house was near Tattersalls' sales arena; they now share a luxury bungalow in Hamilton Road. He lives there with Susan in close proximity to both his elder daughter, Maureen, (who is married to William Haggas) and to Jamie, a son born to his former assistant, Anna Ludlow. Ego drives champions, and ever since Piggott realised that he was the best he has treated the law with steadfast indifference.

To nominate the most talented horse he rode is, he thinks, to diminish the other champions. He knows, of course, but would rather keep it to himself than offend those he has passed over.

Murless rated the ride Piggott gave tough little Carozza to win the 1977 Oaks for the Queen as the best he could recall, but the most memorable filly of their partnership was Petite Etoile. The grey won the 1,000 Guineas, the Oaks, two Coronation Cups and a Champion Stakes; she was never out of the first two in 19 races over four seasons in the Fifites and Sixties, but scarcely lasted a mile and a half. His gossamer rein persuaded the petulant filly that she was barely exerting herself. 'She was a right monkey at the best of times,' was Murless's euphemistic observation, but their combined finesse controlled her temperament. Piggott's light touch could be matched by a shade of violence, and the victory of Roberto in 1972 was the most controversial of his Derbies. Bill Williamson, the colt's regular jockey, was recovering from injury and the owner wanted Piggott to ride. Lester had a reputation for easing his rivals out of the saddle, but, for once, Piggott was wrongly blamed by the press and public. With less than two furlongs to run, Roberto was given a hefty bump by the weakening leader, Pentland Firth, at the same time as being squeezed on his outside by Rheingold, ridden by the lightweight Ernie Johnson. Rheingold was half a length ahead entering the final furlong, and should have won, but he hung into his rival, persistently bumping him. With Rheingold so close, Piggott could not use his whip effectively until well inside the final furlong. Then, with Roberto balanced, Piggott let loose. The crack of his flailing whip cut through the roar of the stands, compelling Roberto to respond. The two exhausted colts flashed across the line eye to eye. 'The Minstrel had a hard race in the Derby, when he just got up to beat Willie [Carson] on Hot Grove, but I was harder on Roberto,' Piggott admits. 'I had to win, you know, and he wasn't doing much for me. I felt he could go faster if only he would. When we passed the post I thought I was beat, but I wasn't worried because I was sure I would get the race in the Stewards' Room.' To Lester, Roberto's reluctance justified the ferocity of his ride, one of the greatest in racing, a flagrant imposition of one man's will on history, seared in the memory as surely as an oak scorched by lightning. In public, Piggott's temperament remained equable throughout a career peppered with injuries, with death threats, with physical deprivation. At over 5ft 7in tall, he has spent most of his life weighing 8st 4lb, two stones light, riding daily on little more nourishment than the famous regime of small coffees and large cigars. In retirement he likes ice cream, but still watches his weight. The lizard-lined face of his fifties is fuller now, the skin softer, easing the labyrinth of wrinkles. Most days at Newmarket he calls into the Somerville Lodge stables of his son-in-law, in which he owns shares in four horses, the useful handicapper Royal Artist, and three two-year-olds, Horoscope, Prima Diva and La Perla. Last season his syndicate's colours were carried to victory by Superstar Leo in the Norfolk Stakes at Royal Ascot, the meeting at which he rode 114 winners. The owners sold their filly, prematurely as it transpired, but you can bet that Lester made a substantial profit. He has always hated the cold, and in winter travels widely with his wife Susan. Over forty years their marriage has been tempered from passion to devotion by the flames of fame and shame. The man who was born on Guy Fawkes' Day may no longer burst into an explosion of colour and power on flying thoroughbreds, but never has he seemed so content. Piggott on His reputation for ruthlessness 'When I was young, I didn't want to get beaten and go back with excuses. It was every man for himself. You went out to win. Yes, I did cut up one or two, and them me. But you can't do two things, do your best to win all the time, and be careful all the time' The best horse he has ever ridden 'In terms of raw ability, Nijinsky was probably the best. He got nervous before his races, and I was always anxious until he had jumped out of the stalls. Then he'd drop the bit and you could put him anywhere in a race' Why he had to whip Roberto hard to win the 1972 Derby 'I had to win, you know, and he wasn't doing much for me. I felt he could go faster if only he would' His time in jail 'I decided to keep my head down, keep my nose clean' On Piggott 'One of the grandest sights in racing has always been to see Lester hauled before the stewards. He goes in there like Clint Eastwood, and he comes out like Clint Eastwood. Lester doesn't give a monkey's' Bryn Crossley, jockey 'He is quite a good rider, but will never be as good as his father. Don't make a fuss, Lester is just a very ordinary boy' His mother Iris after 12-year-old Lester made his debut 'He would lock away his Yorkie bars and cigars and when he unlocked the cupboard he would take out one piece of Yorkie at a time' Walter Swinburn, jockey 'I have seen Steve Donoghue, Gordon Richards and the great Australian jockeys, but he was in a class of his own' Lord Carnarvon, the Queen's racing manager 'The best jockey ever. Gordon Richards was a better rider, but Piggott was always one step ahead. He could come home in sixth, but see another horse in the pack and work out where and why it went wrong. He would go to the owner and say, \"Let me ride your horse at Beverley on Tuesday and I'll win.\" And it would' Terry Pritchard, agent 'I kept a scrapbook on him when I was younger. Unbelievable man. He could even think like a horse' Graham Bradley, jockey",

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair overruled the Treasury to strike a deal with Bob Kiley over the Tube amid fears that the ongoing row would cost Labour seats in the capital. The prime minister ended the stalemate surrounding the part-privatisation of the London Underground on Friday by agreeing that Kiley, the American transport expert hired by Ken Livingstone to run the Tube, should handle final negotiations and granting his demands for greater control over the network. Blair has hosted two meetings with Kiley in the last fortnight and was said to 'understand' Kiley's concerns that the part-privatisation framework laid down by the Treasury might not deliver a coherent and unified system of control. The decision will be seen by Livingstone as a sweet victory over his bitter enemy Gordon Brown, who has so far stuck resolutely to his guns in blocking Kiley's demands. The Mayor had warned that its handling of the transport issue could backfire on Labour at the ballot box in June, pointing out that both the Tories and the Liberal Democrats were opposed to the part-privatisation. Kiley has long argued for unified management control over the network to ensure the safety of the service. He will now chair London Transport and handle final negotiations with the two selected consortia responsible for refurbishing the ailing system, beginning next week the process of wresting control of maintenance of trains, signals and track away from the two private consortia of internationally renowned construction firms into his hands. He will also draw up a strict timetable of infrastructure improvements and attempt to insert a contract clause within the frameworkwhich will allow him to terminate consortia contracts if they fail to deliver. Kiley confirmed to The Observer that he will still plough ahead with legal action against the Government if he fails to reach agreement with the preferred bidders, including Balfour Beatty who were responsible for maintaining the section of rail which caused the Hatfield train disaster last October. 'We'll know within a few weeks whether we've made progress,' he said. Effectively, he will decide on the eve of a June election whether to take the Government to court, in a bid to exert maximum political pressure. Livingstone welcomed the decision. 'There's now a wonderful opportunity for London to get the tube system it requires,' he added. 'This decision signals a constructive approach to devolved regional power.' The PPP negotiating process will still take four months to resolve. If a deal is reached, board meetings will be open to the public under Kiley's system. However there are indications that the consortia could climbdown on the issue of maintenance, a major part of their money-making potential under the deal. The row over the Tube has raged since the Treasury imposed PPP on the deputy prime minister John Prescott four years ago. The debate goes to the heart of Labour's Third Way policy aimed at using private capital for public projects such as hospitals, roads and schools. Under PPP the Tube network would be split into three sections, with leading construction firms investing billions to maintain and refurbish it for 30 years, while London Underground owns the rolling stock. The Treasury has agreed for the first time to give the Tube a secure income stream for over seven years. But critics fear PPP would replicate mistakes made in the privatisation of British Rail, with lines of management control blurred and no one in overall charge.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>In the early hours of 2 May 1997, as swathes of Britain that had been Conservative for a generation were enveloped by his landslide, a small jet flew Tony Blair and the most intimate members of his entourage south from Sedgefield. He was about to become the first Labour Prime Minister in 18 years, enthroned at the apex of the majority greater than for any party in more than six decades. Still only 43, he would be the youngest occupant of Number 10 since Lord Liverpool in 1812. And to no one was this sensational prospect more awesome than Blair himself. As the plane sped to London, his wife grasped his hand and chatted excitedly about his 'great opportunity'. To Cherie, Tony replied: 'But I've never been in government.'</p> <p>With Leo, his father, he shared similar trepidations. 'Realising that you are about to be Prime Minister is a very strange moment,' Blair reflected later. 'My dad was fabulous. He was absolutely knocked out by it. He said: \"Mum would have been very proud.\" But he read my mood correctly. He kept saying to me during the evening: \"You will do it well.\" He understood what I was worrying about.'</p> <p>Four years on, as he prepares to launch his campaign for re-election, what everyone neglects to note is just how much of a novice to power Blair was. He had managed nothing except a hungry, skilful Opposition against an exhausted Tory Government with a death-wish. He had never seen the inside of a red box, nor given instructions to a civil servant. He had not even been a Parliamentary Private Secretary, lowest form of life on the Ministerial food chain.</p> <p>It is a tribute to Blair, the ingenue of May 1997, that his total inexperience in office has never been mentioned since. As the honeymoon has steadily deflated, he has been flayed as an opportunist, an autocrat, a betrayer, a manipulator and a charlatan. In some quarters of Left and Right, the man is utterly loathed, not so much for his failures, so I sometimes think, as for being a success. What even the most vituperative opponents never say of him, as the critics did of John Major, Anthony Eden, Ramsay MacDonald, Arthur Balfour and many other previous occupants of Number 10, is that Blair is not up to doing the job of Prime Minister.</p> <p>The virgin to power now wears the scars of a veteran. He has fought a war. He has sacked one of his oldest friends and closest allies. Twice. He has been blooded by short and savage crises, and toughened by long and debilitating struggles. It's there to be read in his face. The crows have splayed their feet more heavily around the eyes, the hairline is in retreat, the brow is ploughed with deeper furrows. Office has engraved itself on the man whose biggest marketing feature was once a boyishly cheesy grin. One of the most workaholic members of the Cabinet comments: 'I get completely knackered doing my job. By the end of the week, I'm a dead man walking. Tony works twice as hard as I do.'</p> <p>Blair is also a more grizzled man where it doesn't show so obviously, inside his head. 'He's matured. I think his skin is a lot thicker,' says one of his intimates. 'His ability to differentiate between the important and the pressing has improved. I think he's clearer what it's all about.'</p> <p>Some aspects of Blair have become more pronounced by office. 'Never forget he's a lawyer,' remarks another close aide, adding that the Prime Minister displays both sides of the legal temperament. Blair is the rapid master of a brief. Staff at Number 10 have been confounded by the time he has devoted to grappling with the minutiae of foot and mouth. He can also display a lawyer's slipperiness, skating to the edge of mendacity, and occasionally beyond it, as a refuge from uncomfortable truths.</p> <p>Like his grandparents, Jimmy Lynton and Celia Ridgway, he is an actor: the consummate political actor of his era. Like them, he can play both music hall and straight drama, he can do soap TV and the ceremony of state. He surfed the sea of emoting which followed the death of Diana, still the most vivid demonstration of an intuitive grasp of what the majority want to hear coupled with a thespian ability to turn it into a performance which will be applauded. Four years of familiarity with the act has inevitably left much of the audience more contemptuous. He was humiliatingly handbagged by the massed motherlode of the Women's Institute. Yet there is still no other politician that comes close to matching his talent for the actorly aspect of politics.</p> <p>In common with most thespians, he is a worrier. At times of heavy stress and frustration, his nervous energy nukes into what a Blairite Minister dubs 'Tony's meltdown moments'. Each weekend, his courtiers wait for their fax machines to spew forth the rolls of hand-written anxieties that are fretting the leader. His personal assistant, Anji Hunter, says she is alerted to the fax's arrival by her husband shouting: 'Here comes your Sunday night stream of consciousness.' Blair can spend hours agonising over every angle of a single detail of a quite obscure policy. Staff refer to 'Tony's circular discussions'. Though they are reluctant to admit it, he is as obsessive as ever about the media. As the stream of leaked memos last year helped confirm, the most image-neurotic member of the regime is the leader himself. He invented the phrase 'governing by headline', and has yet to fully grasp that it is not only undesirable but any way impossible. One Labour strategist is often in the room when it happens: ' Sky News will be on. Tony will see something he doesn't like and shout at Alastair, \"Stop it!\" The complaint is always the same: \"Why aren't we getting our message across?\"'</p> <p>The surest indicator of the imminence of the election is the newspaper commentators, editors and proprietors - ah, there goes Rupert Murdoch - streaming in for audiences at Number 10. Some of the product of those chats visible in the press suggests that each visitor is hearing what is most likely to please them. Blair likes to be liked. The promiscuous politics of the 'Big Tent' is an extension of a character as much as it is a tactic to maximise support.

He returned from his first meeting with the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, fizzing to aides: 'I've really made a connection.' It is a talent that he also employs cynically. Characters as diverse as Paddy Ashdown, Gordon Brown and Frank Field have been in receipt of promises from Blair which turned out to be much flakier than he had led them to expect.</p> <p>'Tony thinks he can conquer the world with charm,' says a senior politician with close-up and personal experience of the technique.

'There are no New Labour papers,' is a complaint as bitter as it has been regular throughout his time as Prime Minister.</p> <p>Insecurity is a common feature of the family backgrounds of both Blair and his wife. It finds creative expression in his drive, focus and impatience to see results. A less attractive manifestation is an exaggerated respect for wealth, bordering on an infatuation with money.

The most surprising, and least appetising, aspect of his character exposed by office is an ethical blind-spot. Geoffrey Robinson is not the only multi-millionaire of spotty provenance to whom Blair placed himself in hock with the result that the Government is put in the dock. One of his worst meltdown moments was at the time of the Ecclestone Affair when Blair despaired to one of his closest familiars: 'This is the end. They'll get me for this.' Rather than learn from that searing lesson early in his premiership, he has allowed mudslides of sleaze to tarnish the Government, mocking the pledge to be 'purer than pure'.

He wondered aloud whether 'the experiences in the Eighties almost scarred me too much' after his paranoia about losing control led him into disastrously counter-productive attempts to fix devolution in Wales and London. The worst crises of the regime - the double sackings of Mandelson, the turbulent love-loathe relationship with Gordon Brown - have been generated by the emotionally fraught relationships between New Labour's founding figures.</p> <p>Confronted by an external challenge, Blair usually impresses. He tends to be at his strongest in an emergency when there is no time - or it is too late - to panic. An extremely senior civil servant compares him to Margaret Thatcher in the way in which he 'throws himself' at crises. The highly exposed position he took during the war for Kosovo threatened, so he believed as did many close to him, to cost him the premiership. When aides and officials urged him not to screw his reputation to the pledge to expel the Serbs, Blair replied that he knew 'this could be the end of me', but it was 'shit or bust'. Without the instrumental role played by Britain's Christian soldier, Milosevic would still be in power today, and Kosovo would be ethnically cleansed. Clare Short, who for a long time harboured a fairly poisonous opinion of Blair, was won over to him on the simple grounds: 'He did the right thing.'</p> <p>And he did the same in Northern Ireland. George Mitchell, the former American senator, is our most objective witness. He has no doubt that Blair's decision to hurl himself into the negotiations to save them from implosion was both brave and critical to the successful outcome. The ability to build bonds of trust with other politicians of widely disparate character and belief allied with the talent for consensus-building were rewarded with the Good Friday Agreement and its implementation. He has got closer to an enduring settlement in Ireland than any Prime Minister since William Gladstone.</p> <p>The more disappointing Blair is manifest when he is controlled by the side of his nature which is cramped by calculation and caution. A female member of the Cabinet privately refers to him as 'Mr Crab' for scuttling away from difficult decisions. As time has stripped off the rhetorical varnishing, the Government emerges through the hyperbole for what it is: incrementally reforming, social democrat, with some illiberally socially authoritarian edges, which broadly sums up Blair himself. A couple of months ago, he gave an under-reported and remarkably candid speech self-dissecting the Government. He conceded that the 'first phase of New Labour was essentially one of reassurance'.</p> <p>The overwhelming driver has been to prove they are safe hands, fit to run the country, especially its economy.

Two continuous full terms of office will immediately set him apart from every previous Labour Prime Minister, and elevate him above many Tories and Liberal predecessors. Blair could fall out of a helicopter tomorrow, and he would leave enduring monuments to his rule, from the Scottish Parliament to independence for the Bank of England to the minimum wage.

He was only getting half the attention of a rather glazed Prime Minister until they touched on Europe.

To those to whom he entrusts his inner anxieties, he has recently been fretting that he doesn't want to be remembered as another Harold Wilson, who won four elections out of five, had eight years in power, talked a lot about modernising Britain, and wound up with a very indifferent historical reputation. This animates his constant, if vague, insistence that the second term will be 'more radical' than people think.

      "bodyText": "In the early hours of 2 May 1997, as swathes of Britain that had been Conservative for a generation were enveloped by his landslide, a small jet flew Tony Blair and the most intimate members of his entourage south from Sedgefield. He was about to become the first Labour Prime Minister in 18 years, enthroned at the apex of the majority greater than for any party in more than six decades. Still only 43, he would be the youngest occupant of Number 10 since Lord Liverpool in 1812. And to no one was this sensational prospect more awesome than Blair himself. As the plane sped to London, his wife grasped his hand and chatted excitedly about his 'great opportunity'. To Cherie, Tony replied: 'But I've never been in government.' With Leo, his father, he shared similar trepidations. 'Realising that you are about to be Prime Minister is a very strange moment,' Blair reflected later. 'My dad was fabulous. He was absolutely knocked out by it. He said: \"Mum would have been very proud.\" But he read my mood correctly. He kept saying to me during the evening: \"You will do it well.\" He understood what I was worrying about.' Four years on, as he prepares to launch his campaign for re-election, what everyone neglects to note is just how much of a novice to power Blair was. He had managed nothing except a hungry, skilful Opposition against an exhausted Tory Government with a death-wish. He had never seen the inside of a red box, nor given instructions to a civil servant. He had not even been a Parliamentary Private Secretary, lowest form of life on the Ministerial food chain. It is a tribute to Blair, the ingenue of May 1997, that his total inexperience in office has never been mentioned since. As the honeymoon has steadily deflated, he has been flayed as an opportunist, an autocrat, a betrayer, a manipulator and a charlatan. In some quarters of Left and Right, the man is utterly loathed, not so much for his failures, so I sometimes think, as for being a success. What even the most vituperative opponents never say of him, as the critics did of John Major, Anthony Eden, Ramsay MacDonald, Arthur Balfour and many other previous occupants of Number 10, is that Blair is not up to doing the job of Prime Minister. The virgin to power now wears the scars of a veteran. He has fought a war. He has sacked one of his oldest friends and closest allies. Twice. He has been blooded by short and savage crises, and toughened by long and debilitating struggles. It's there to be read in his face. The crows have splayed their feet more heavily around the eyes, the hairline is in retreat, the brow is ploughed with deeper furrows. Office has engraved itself on the man whose biggest marketing feature was once a boyishly cheesy grin. One of the most workaholic members of the Cabinet comments: 'I get completely knackered doing my job. By the end of the week, I'm a dead man walking. Tony works twice as hard as I do.' Blair is also a more grizzled man where it doesn't show so obviously, inside his head. 'He's matured. I think his skin is a lot thicker,' says one of his intimates. 'His ability to differentiate between the important and the pressing has improved. I think he's clearer what it's all about.' Some aspects of Blair have become more pronounced by office. 'Never forget he's a lawyer,' remarks another close aide, adding that the Prime Minister displays both sides of the legal temperament. Blair is the rapid master of a brief. Staff at Number 10 have been confounded by the time he has devoted to grappling with the minutiae of foot and mouth. He can also display a lawyer's slipperiness, skating to the edge of mendacity, and occasionally beyond it, as a refuge from uncomfortable truths. Like his grandparents, Jimmy Lynton and Celia Ridgway, he is an actor: the consummate political actor of his era. Like them, he can play both music hall and straight drama, he can do soap TV and the ceremony of state. He surfed the sea of emoting which followed the death of Diana, still the most vivid demonstration of an intuitive grasp of what the majority want to hear coupled with a thespian ability to turn it into a performance which will be applauded. Four years of familiarity with the act has inevitably left much of the audience more contemptuous. He was humiliatingly handbagged by the massed motherlode of the Women's Institute. Yet there is still no other politician that comes close to matching his talent for the actorly aspect of politics. In common with most thespians, he is a worrier. At times of heavy stress and frustration, his nervous energy nukes into what a Blairite Minister dubs 'Tony's meltdown moments'. Each weekend, his courtiers wait for their fax machines to spew forth the rolls of hand-written anxieties that are fretting the leader. His personal assistant, Anji Hunter, says she is alerted to the fax's arrival by her husband shouting: 'Here comes your Sunday night stream of consciousness.' Blair can spend hours agonising over every angle of a single detail of a quite obscure policy. Staff refer to 'Tony's circular discussions'. Though they are reluctant to admit it, he is as obsessive as ever about the media. As the stream of leaked memos last year helped confirm, the most image-neurotic member of the regime is the leader himself. He invented the phrase 'governing by headline', and has yet to fully grasp that it is not only undesirable but any way impossible. One Labour strategist is often in the room when it happens: ' Sky News will be on. Tony will see something he doesn't like and shout at Alastair, \"Stop it!\" The complaint is always the same: \"Why aren't we getting our message across?\"' The surest indicator of the imminence of the election is the newspaper commentators, editors and proprietors - ah, there goes Rupert Murdoch - streaming in for audiences at Number 10. Some of the product of those chats visible in the press suggests that each visitor is hearing what is most likely to please them. Blair likes to be liked. The promiscuous politics of the 'Big Tent' is an extension of a character as much as it is a tactic to maximise support. I think there is only one member of the Cabinet who harbours really deep enmity towards this Prime Minister. That is an unusually low hate rating for a leader, and to be contrasted with the high levels of fear and loathing a lot of Ministers radiate towards the Chancellor. Blair has always invested great faith in his ability to talk his way through dilemmas, out of trouble or into alliances. He returned from his first meeting with the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, fizzing to aides: 'I've really made a connection.' It is a talent that he also employs cynically. Characters as diverse as Paddy Ashdown, Gordon Brown and Frank Field have been in receipt of promises from Blair which turned out to be much flakier than he had led them to expect.

      "body": "<p>A cold, driving rain whips in across the fields. In the distance, the lights of Calais flicker wetly in the dusk. The roads, the ploughed earth and the thin strip of sea merge into a monotone slate grey and finally disappear into the gloom. It is nearly nine o'clock. By the roadside, Mohammed Ishaq, his wife and four children are waiting.</p> <p>Tonight, like every night for the past two weeks, the six of them will be picked up and driven to the Eurostar terminal a mile or so away. They will, as they did last night and the night before, try to slip under the wire, crawl through the fencing, drop from bridges, secrete themselves in freight containers, hang from truck axles.</p> <p>It is four months since they left their home in Afghanistan. They will do whatever it takes to make their way to Britain. They will keep trying, Mohammed Ishaq says, until they succeed.</p> <p>A Mercedes pulls up, the family get in and are driven off. The car's headlights slice through the rain to reveal six Kosovan men walking in file along the road, two Iranians wrapped in bin-liners scrambling behind them, a dozen Kurds in a ragged cluster of soaked shell-suits and trainers, two Pakistanis picking their way between the puddles.</p> <p>According to Claude Devos, 53, who runs Le Weekend bar on Sangatte's main street, these are not refugees, or economic migrants, or bogus asylum-seekers, or the poor and huddled masses. These are the advance guard of an invasion.</p> <p>As the rain hammers against his bar's windows, he thumps a fist on his counter and makes his point again. 'It is absolutely like the Romans and the Gauls,' he says. 'This is the first wave of the army of Islam and we are being conquered. I am not a racist, I am not a political man, but I know I am speaking the truth.' Around the dim bar his clients nod, and tip their glasses in agreement.</p> <p>Such rhetoric is not rare in western Europe. Interpol estimates that more than half a million people illegally entered the EU last year, up from 40,000 in 1993. A tabloid newspaper describes Sangatte as the 'village from hell', a 'war zone' where thousands of 'marauding' asylum-seekers wreak 'mayhem' before sneaking into Britain. Though John Townend MP received a slap on the wrist from Tory leader William Hague when he said mass immigration would turn Britain into a 'mongrel' race, no one doubts that his views are shared by many. With 75,000 people applying in the UK last year, everyone knows that asylum and immigration will be a key issue in the election.</p> <p>Last week Tony Blair himself, aware that Labour is seen as weak on the issue, launched a counter-offensive. Writing in the Times, he said that the 1951 Geneva Convention that underpins the European asylum system should be mod ernised, and stressed that Labour's criticism of the Conservatives had been about 'opportunism', not racism.</p> <p>The problem is that the arguments on all sides of the debate are founded on myths and prejudices that bear little resemblance to reality.</p> <p>Just outside Sangatte is a huge steel warehouse where the Red Cross, on behalf of the French government, provides food, showers, toilets and beds for between 300 and 1,000 asylum-seekers. It was set up 18 months ago, when local authorities grew tired of the hordes sleeping rough in the village. Right-wing British politicians claim it is a waiting room for people attempting to enter the UK. And it is.</p> <p>'If I don't see my friend the next morning, that means one of three things - he's made it across, the police have him, or something bad has happened,' said Zakar, a 26-year-old Chechen who has spent two weeks at the Red Cross centre. So far 26,000 people are estimated to have used the facility. Almost all are now in the UK. Last week there were about 300 there.</p> <p>Before Eurotunnel invested \u00a32 million in extra security and the ferry companies started testing for exhaled breath in lorry containers, most people used to spend only a few days at the centre. Now they spend several weeks. But they usually get to the UK in the end. But who are these people? Are they asylum-seekers? Are they 'bogus' economic migrants, refugees? Do any of these terms mean anything? Speak to any of those hanging around Sangatte and you get the same stories.</p> <p>Few talk about persecution. Most talk about the sheer awfulness of their lives, a future which makes selling everything they had and entrusting their money and lives to criminals the best option.

      "bodyText": "A cold, driving rain whips in across the fields. In the distance, the lights of Calais flicker wetly in the dusk. The roads, the ploughed earth and the thin strip of sea merge into a monotone slate grey and finally disappear into the gloom. It is nearly nine o'clock. By the roadside, Mohammed Ishaq, his wife and four children are waiting. Tonight, like every night for the past two weeks, the six of them will be picked up and driven to the Eurostar terminal a mile or so away. They will, as they did last night and the night before, try to slip under the wire, crawl through the fencing, drop from bridges, secrete themselves in freight containers, hang from truck axles. It is four months since they left their home in Afghanistan. They will do whatever it takes to make their way to Britain. They will keep trying, Mohammed Ishaq says, until they succeed. A Mercedes pulls up, the family get in and are driven off. The car's headlights slice through the rain to reveal six Kosovan men walking in file along the road, two Iranians wrapped in bin-liners scrambling behind them, a dozen Kurds in a ragged cluster of soaked shell-suits and trainers, two Pakistanis picking their way between the puddles. According to Claude Devos, 53, who runs Le Weekend bar on Sangatte's main street, these are not refugees, or economic migrants, or bogus asylum-seekers, or the poor and huddled masses. These are the advance guard of an invasion. As the rain hammers against his bar's windows, he thumps a fist on his counter and makes his point again. 'It is absolutely like the Romans and the Gauls,' he says. 'This is the first wave of the army of Islam and we are being conquered. I am not a racist, I am not a political man, but I know I am speaking the truth.' Around the dim bar his clients nod, and tip their glasses in agreement. Such rhetoric is not rare in western Europe. Interpol estimates that more than half a million people illegally entered the EU last year, up from 40,000 in 1993. A tabloid newspaper describes Sangatte as the 'village from hell', a 'war zone' where thousands of 'marauding' asylum-seekers wreak 'mayhem' before sneaking into Britain. Though John Townend MP received a slap on the wrist from Tory leader William Hague when he said mass immigration would turn Britain into a 'mongrel' race, no one doubts that his views are shared by many. With 75,000 people applying in the UK last year, everyone knows that asylum and immigration will be a key issue in the election. Last week Tony Blair himself, aware that Labour is seen as weak on the issue, launched a counter-offensive. Writing in the Times, he said that the 1951 Geneva Convention that underpins the European asylum system should be mod ernised, and stressed that Labour's criticism of the Conservatives had been about 'opportunism', not racism. The problem is that the arguments on all sides of the debate are founded on myths and prejudices that bear little resemblance to reality. Just outside Sangatte is a huge steel warehouse where the Red Cross, on behalf of the French government, provides food, showers, toilets and beds for between 300 and 1,000 asylum-seekers. It was set up 18 months ago, when local authorities grew tired of the hordes sleeping rough in the village. Right-wing British politicians claim it is a waiting room for people attempting to enter the UK. And it is. 'If I don't see my friend the next morning, that means one of three things - he's made it across, the police have him, or something bad has happened,' said Zakar, a 26-year-old Chechen who has spent two weeks at the Red Cross centre. So far 26,000 people are estimated to have used the facility. Almost all are now in the UK. Last week there were about 300 there. Before Eurotunnel invested \u00a32 million in extra security and the ferry companies started testing for exhaled breath in lorry containers, most people used to spend only a few days at the centre. Now they spend several weeks. But they usually get to the UK in the end. But who are these people? Are they asylum-seekers? Are they 'bogus' economic migrants, refugees? Do any of these terms mean anything? Speak to any of those hanging around Sangatte and you get the same stories. Few talk about persecution. Most talk about the sheer awfulness of their lives, a future which makes selling everything they had and entrusting their money and lives to criminals the best option. Mohammed Ishaq and his family are typical. They are Tajik Afghans, and thus from a minority who are discriminated against by the Taliban. But Ishaq does not mention persecution when he explains his flight. 'There are no schools in Kabul,' he says. 'There is no money. We were hungry and cold all the time. I wanted something better for my children.' Ishaq sold his shop to raise the $9,000 (\u00a36,400) 'fare' to England. He first travelled to Karachi, where a middleman took his cash and hid him and his family in the truck which took them through Iran and Turkey. That was in January. Now he has no money left. 'Going back is impossible, Everywhere there are problems,' he told The Observer . By most definitions Ishaq is an economic migrant. If, when he arrives in Britain, he claims that he was 'persecuted' in Afghanistan, he will be a 'bogus' asylum-seeker. The same can be said for many, if not most, of those in the Red Cross shelter. They do not claim to be fleeing an immediate threat of torture or imprisonment. Instead they are following the inexorable logic that determines today's immigration flows - 'they have very little; we have a lot'. Only a tiny minority are running from electrodes or helicopter gunships. And Britain is seen as a 'soft touch'. Though some, especially from Pakistan and India, are drawn by affinities traceable to the days of Empire, many are not. Few at Sangatte speak English. Ishaq speaks only Urdu and Farsi. But he knows that in Germany asylum-seekers only get medical treatment in extreme cases, that in France identity cards make life as an 'illegal' difficult, and that in the UK financial aid for asylum-seekers is more generous then elsewhere. But few of the myths of the Right stand up to scrutiny either. According to Devos the men who hang around outside his shop are ill-educated religious zealots.

      "bodyText": "Wembley Stadium should be rebuilt as a multi-million pound football and athletics arena, which would become the centrepiece for a British bid for the Olympics in 2012, according to senior footballing sources behind the project. The new national stadium would be backed by both the Football Association and the Government and would be the leading element of a bid supported by the Prime Minister and centred on various locations around London. The Government is known to be interested in backing a London bid for the Games after the general election, although so far it has concentrated on developing plans for a new stadium in the east of the capital. The Mayor, Ken Livingstone, also backs that option, arguing that building it in the less affluent East End means that it would be able to bring in extra European regeneration money. But Adam Crozier, the chief executive of the FA, believes that the formula based around Wembley would prevent the Government being faced with the embarrassment of the bulldozers moving on to the site and no new national stadium rising in its place. Crozier has told Home Secretary Jack Straw, who has been put in charge of rescuing the failed Wembley plans, that the move could help resolve the fiasco surrounding the development, which descended into farce last week when the FA conceded that it had failed to persuade City banks to stump up the \u00a3660 million needed for the project. The Government has so far refused to put any of its own money into the new Wembley project, saying that football is rich enough to fund its own national stadium. Creating a new national stadium suitable for athletics as part of an Olympic bid would allow the Government to underwrite Wembley arguing that it is a truly national project. The FA is now prepared to contribute \u00a3100m to the cost of the development. With a Lottery grant of \u00a3120m already secured, the project would have a funding gap of \u00a3380m plus interest. The Government would probably take the lion's share of this, with City institutions taking on the remainder. Plans for a new Wembley will include a running track, which the Culture Secretary, Chris Smith, originally excluded from the doomed project.

      "body": "<p>Illegal consignments of meat potentially infected with the foot and mouth virus are still being smuggled into Britain and could spark a new outbreak of the disease.</p> <p>Customs raids on three aircraft at Heathrow Airport last week found more than half a tonne of meat in personal baggage from Nigeria, Ghana and China. All of those countries have endemic foot and mouth and illegally imported meat from the Far East is seen as the most likely source of the current epidemic.</p> <p>The seized meat, known as 'bush meat', consisted of antelope, monkey, dried fish and other unidentifiable pieces. Foot and mouth can survive for six months in dried meat and officials believe the amount arriving in Britain is at least 10 times greater than what is detected at airports.</p> <p>The revelations will come as an embarrassment to the Government after a week in which it declared the epidemic had been virtually brought under control. Experts warn that the massive influx of illegal meat, thought to total more than 1,000 tonnes a year, could seriously undermine the slaughter programme that has seen the flow of new cases of the virus slow to under 10 a day.</p> <p>'A fresh consignment of this meat could start a new outbreak. That could happen at any time. At the same time as we are controlling the current problem, we are not doing anything to stop what may have caused it in the first place,' said Professor Joe Brownlie of the Royal Veterinary College.</p> <p>Last Sunday, airport offi cials took 444kg of meat off flights from Ghana and China after searching each passenger passing through Customs. 'We only get a tiny percentage of what is coming in, and most of it is coming from areas that are considered dangerous for foot and mouth and other viruses,' said Clive Lawrance, head of Ciel Logistics, a firm that oversees the importation of perishable goods at Heathrow.</p> <p>Lawrance said one bag of chicken parts confiscated on the Nigerian flight was almost completely rotten. 'It was green and smelt awful.'</p> <p>Most of the meat is destined for private use or for ethnic restaurants. The trade could be worth \u00a37 million a year.</p> <p>Lawrance believes it operates with the collusion of corrupt airline officials and that most passengers carrying meat are used as 'mules' to deliver it in Britain.</p> <p>Raids at Heathrow hit Ghana Airways flight 770 on 4, 12 and 15 April. On each occasion, large amounts of illegal meat were uncovered. The total haul, much of it rancid and bloody, was 698kg. Six bags of meat were also discovered abandoned by their owners in the arrivals lounge, where some of the blood had leaked on to the floor, which could be a potential source of contamination.

      "bodyText": "Illegal consignments of meat potentially infected with the foot and mouth virus are still being smuggled into Britain and could spark a new outbreak of the disease. Customs raids on three aircraft at Heathrow Airport last week found more than half a tonne of meat in personal baggage from Nigeria, Ghana and China. All of those countries have endemic foot and mouth and illegally imported meat from the Far East is seen as the most likely source of the current epidemic. The seized meat, known as 'bush meat', consisted of antelope, monkey, dried fish and other unidentifiable pieces. Foot and mouth can survive for six months in dried meat and officials believe the amount arriving in Britain is at least 10 times greater than what is detected at airports. The revelations will come as an embarrassment to the Government after a week in which it declared the epidemic had been virtually brought under control. Experts warn that the massive influx of illegal meat, thought to total more than 1,000 tonnes a year, could seriously undermine the slaughter programme that has seen the flow of new cases of the virus slow to under 10 a day. 'A fresh consignment of this meat could start a new outbreak. That could happen at any time. At the same time as we are controlling the current problem, we are not doing anything to stop what may have caused it in the first place,' said Professor Joe Brownlie of the Royal Veterinary College. Last Sunday, airport offi cials took 444kg of meat off flights from Ghana and China after searching each passenger passing through Customs. 'We only get a tiny percentage of what is coming in, and most of it is coming from areas that are considered dangerous for foot and mouth and other viruses,' said Clive Lawrance, head of Ciel Logistics, a firm that oversees the importation of perishable goods at Heathrow. Lawrance said one bag of chicken parts confiscated on the Nigerian flight was almost completely rotten. 'It was green and smelt awful.' Most of the meat is destined for private use or for ethnic restaurants. The trade could be worth \u00a37 million a year. Lawrance believes it operates with the collusion of corrupt airline officials and that most passengers carrying meat are used as 'mules' to deliver it in Britain. Raids at Heathrow hit Ghana Airways flight 770 on 4, 12 and 15 April. On each occasion, large amounts of illegal meat were uncovered. The total haul, much of it rancid and bloody, was 698kg. Six bags of meat were also discovered abandoned by their owners in the arrivals lounge, where some of the blood had leaked on to the floor, which could be a potential source of contamination. There have been calls for Britain to adopt a regime more like that in New Zealand, where X-ray machines and sniffer dogs search for imported meat. New Zealand has never had a foot and mouth outbreak. \u0095 Additional reporting: Brian Johnson-Thomas What's going on?

The Ramblers Association said areas where paths were not being reopened fast enough included Lincolnshire, North Yorkshire, Buckinghamshire, Lancashire and Durham. </p> <p>Kate Ashbrook, the association's chairwoman, said: 'If not all the paths are open, it's not easy for people to find out which ones are open and people just don't go to the countryside at all. There is no excuse, particularly outside infected areas, for county councils not opening these footpaths.' </p> <p>She accused councils of 'giving farmers a veto' over the reopening of paths where there was no foot and mouth risk. The Government has issued clear guidelines as to what local authorities can do and none of them is doing it and certainly not at the rate the Government expects.' </p> <p>As weather forecasters predicted Mediterranean temperatures in many areas, the English Tourism Council said only 14 per cent of Britons planned a short break this month. It added that 3,000 businesses and 250,000 jobs were at risk if the Government did not award foot and mouth compensation immediately. </p> <p>Consumers could, however, soon benefit from the crisis.

At the Mossburn Animal Centre, a refuge for rescued animals in Hightae, Dumfries and Galloway, more than 30 activists vowed to maintain a human shield around the sanctuary, which holds 14 goats, 15 pigs, four cattle and three sheep. </p> <p>'The animals will be kept by us in a secure area - we will not let them die,' said Amanda Richards, 27, a spokesperson for The Group Against Sanctuary Killings. 'There is no evidence they are infected. The last outbreak was six weeks ago. They have all tested negative since then. The slaughtermen may come today, or maybe next week; either way there will be someone here to meet them.' </p> <p>Yesterday, Maff officials battled to contain the disease on Exmoor. Vets visited a 1,500-head beef farm near Dulverton in an urgent operation to limit an outbreak around the Somerset village of Wiveliscombe, near Taunton, where four cases have been confirmed in the past three days.

Now that he is wailing about the tempora and the mores, it is easy to forget that he won the Conservative leadership in 1997 by posing as a man who might outmodernise Tony Blair. He did not then see Britain as a 'foreign land' but was content to allow his fellow citizens to find their own paths to what limited happiness was on offer.</p> <p>The age of consent for homosexuals should be lowered to 16, he said, and gays should be allowed to marry. ('When they're not causing harm to other people, why should we object?') The single mothers his party had hounded in office should be cherished. ('It is better for a child to have one happy parent who cares and loves him or her than to have two and suffer from domestic violence.') Hague went to the Notting Hill Carnival in shorts and baseball cap and although he looked the saddest white rasta in town that day, his desire to show a faint solidarity with black Britons was worthy.</p> <p>Many of his followers were mortified. 'Why do I share a party with those who advocate sodomite marriage?' cried Norman Tebbit as his treacherous leader abandoned bigotry. Tim Montgomerie, the director of the Conservative Christian Fellowship, warned Hague that sleeping in the same bed as Ffion Jenkins before they had been united in Holy Matrimony violated 'the Christian ideal'. Only by remaining the guardian of the 'Judaeo-Christian' tradition, he added, could the leader 'attract many Christians and others of traditional belief into the activist-hungry Tory party'.</p> <p>Three years on, and Hague had undergone a conversion as profound as Constantine's. In a scene beyond satire, he addressed 8,000 ecstatic evangelicals who gathered to bother God in the Butlins camp at Minehead last year. His flirtation with homosexual rights was a schoolboy phase. He had, it transpired, been opposed to repealing Clause 28 long 'before the issue became newsworthy'. He went on to offer the righteous a deal. If they voted Conservative, he would allow religious broadcasters to catch the souls and money of viewers and listeners. 'With so much material on television no parents would want their children to see, we must give a full opportunity for Christians to put forward exciting and wholesome alternatives. The next Conservative government will ensure that Christians have the same right to national and digital licences as anyone else.'</p> <p>Labour's PRs were ecstatic. Hague was admitting his weakness. He had noted that the average Tory activist was a pensioner, who was not likely, what with the lumbago and shortness of breath, to be particularly active. The Conservative leadership had been forced to take Tim Montgomerie's complaints seriously, and was wooing the energetically religious. If the price of their support was abandoning tolerance and bringing tele-evangelism to Britain, Hague would pay it.</p> <p>I was disconcerted to hear condemnations of apostasy fall from the lips of Tony Blair's followers. But you can't knock New Labour every week and I wrote about the Conservative Party's sinister links with the religious fundamentalists around the American Republicans. I would happily do so again, were it not for a press release dated 3 May from Janet Anderson, the Labour Broadcasting Minister. Representatives of every mainstream religion - Christian, Jewish, Hindu, Muslim, Sikh - had met her to discuss 'whether the restrictions on ownership of national broadcasting licences by religious bodies should now be relaxed due to the greater opportunities the digital age will offer,' she said. They had received a sympathetic hearing.</p> <p>The porn baron, Richard Desmond, whose websites feature Grace, a 79-year-old woman, who masturbates for the delight of the audience and asks: 'Would you like a pair of my wet panties?', is allowed to own the Daily Express (and has been courted by the Godly Hague and Blair). Rupert Murdoch is allowed to own just about everything else.</p> <p>Britain's media law is hardly fastidious. Tele-evangelists may exploit the terrors of the credulous, but it's hard to argue that the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, which owns Liberty Radio, and whose teaching that the sick are possessed by demons may have led to the horrible death of Anna Climbie last year, is more pernicious than, say, the News of the World .</p> <p>The Government's U-turn on religious broadcasting would matter less were it not part of a paradoxical pattern. Britain is one of the most profane societies on Earth - thank God. Yet as faith collapses, sectarians are elevated.</p> <p>You always get you into trouble when you quote statistics on worship. The devout emphasise the numbers who tick boxes in hospitals or on the census form which mark them as Anglican or whatever and talk up evidence of general spiritual yearnings. Atheists can't see how you can be a conforming Christian unless you go to church. The last issue of Religious Trends , published by Christian Research, said that a mere 7 per cent of the population attends church on the average Sunday. Its editor, Dr Peter Brierley, admitted: 'All claims that Britain is a Christian nation will finally have to be given up.' Judaism is disappearing. Despite the relatively recent arrival of black Pentecostal churches, mosques and Hindu and Sikh temples, the British Social Attitudes Survey reports that the number of respondents saying they had no religion rose from 31 per cent in 1983 to 45 per cent in 1998.</p> <p>For all their unpopularity, the Government is more than happy for one third of schools to be controlled by religious organisations and only the National Secular Society complains about the humiliations which follow.</p> <p>Parents, it points out, debase themselves to get a child into a school which may be a few yards from their home and whose costs are paid for by their taxes. They have to protest convictions they don't have. They must attend church to worship gods they don't believe exist, and stand by while priests decide on the future of their children's education. Teachers, too, are caught. If they don't have or can't fake piety, they can be excluded from jobs in thousands of schools.</p> <p>The prisons are going the same way. Religious charities and chaplains control inmates more completely than denominational schools control children. The results are often outrageous - the National Secular Society has letters from prisoners who have been denied parole for refusing to pray - but occasionally hilarious. The Home Office allowed one religious outfit, the Kairos Trust, to take over wings in four prisons. Its director, Kenner Jones, may soon be getting closer to his charges.

William Eaglestone, 28, a law student at the Inns of Court School of Law, was catching a bus to Victoria Station to catch a train when it stopped along Oxford Street. He left the bus to have a look at what was going on and also found himself hemmed in by riot police. They refused to let him leave until 9pm. Eaglestone described being caught up with some protesters who were pushing against the police lines. The crush was so tight that he could not move. 'I was pretty frightened when I got penned up against the shields. The operation was so indiscriminate, they just herded everyone who was there together and treated everyone the same,' he said. Eaglestone said that one man next to him complained to a riot policeman that he was being crushed. 'He told him that he was being crushed twice and the policeman just told him \"no you aren't, you are still breathing\". It was just nuts. The police themselves were the ones breaching the peace.' Media organisations covering the demonstrations will also be demanding to know why police refused to let journalists leave the cordons, even when shown press passes, and why they ushered the media away from witnessing the main confrontation with demonstrators outside the John Lewis store in Oxford Street.",

      "body": "<p>Number 26 General Plant in Kanggye in North Korea's Chagang-Do province is a vast underground complex of concrete hangars located in a forbidden zone guarded by the army. It is not marked on any map. The only visible sign of the factory on the surface is seven clusters of buildings linked by a straggle of roads. There are few places on the planet that are more secret.</p> <p>Last week, the uniformed men and women who labour in the workshops and machine rooms at Kanggye found themselves at ground zero in the biggest shake-up for nuclear proliferation policy in a generation. Hidden from the eyes of the world the workers of Kanggye are building North Korea's most sophisticated missile - the Taepo Dong II - a three-stage rocket that the United States believes is capable of hurling a 750 kilo nuclear warhead across the polar wastes to hit western US cities.</p> <p>Last week the Taepo Dong II - unseen, untested and unflown - became the casus belli of America's new 'cold war'. It is the reason - ostensibly at least - why President George W. Bush is preparing to tear up the 30-year-old Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty, cornerstone of all subsequent nuclear treaties.</p> <p>It is the reason why Bush and his hawkish advisers are proposing to spend upwards of $100 billion on a sea, land and space-borne National Missile Defence umbrella - a system explicitly forbidden by the ABM treaty - whose deployment, its many critics say, risks plunging the world into a new era of weapons proliferation and nuclear uncertainty.</p> <p>Ultimately, too, it is the reason for the uncomfortable position that the Government of Tony Blair finds itself in. The plan is dependent on British permission for America to upgrade its radar site at Fylingdales in North Yorkshire. Now Britain is caught between the disapproval of the rest of the world and the insistence of its most important ally.</p> <p>But while Bush and his Pentagon hawks may in the end be wrong in pursuing their National Missile Defence system at risk of established and functioning nuclear treaties, the Taepo Dong II also represents a challenge to the President's critics. For it is one of the most visible signs of how the world has changed since Richard Nixon and Leonid Brezhnev sat down in 1972 and signed the ABM treaty.</p> <p>Then, Warsaw Pact forces occupied half of Europe and the world was still under the shadow of the Cuban missile crisis. If Bush's plans get no further than the Senate floor he has at least opened a crucial - if angry - debate about what nuclear defences and agreements are appropriate for the New World Disorder.</p> <p>On paper the National Missile Defence system should be a nuclear abolitionist's dream: a system designed to make the threat of nuclear weapons once and for all redundant. If it can be made to work it will create a network of satellites, laser-armed Boeing 747s continuously in flight, missile ships and ground missile launchers that would identify and destroy any threatening missile in flight. It is a very big if.</p> <p>'If this really was an argument for making nuclear weapons obsolete, as Bush implies, then of course anyone would welcome it,' says Dan Plesch of the British American Security Information Centre. 'If there really was a death ray that could destroy nuclear missiles in flight, then who could oppose it? But it is fallible. And if it is fallible it will lead to more, not less, nuclear proliferation. If this system could work infallibly then the nuclear threat, from China, Russia, North Korea, to the US and its allies would be eradicated. Then America would not need nuclear weapons. Bush says that the quid pro quo of installing this system is that America will cut its nuclear arsenal. He is not saying he will abolish it. The logic of that would make the US the only nation on earth whose missiles could hope to hit its enemies.'</p> <p>It is this that is alarming opponents of the NMD. For beneath the US-touted radicalism of a vision that Bush's advisers say would lance the threat of rogue nuclear proliferating states, while making deep unilateral cuts in America's nuclear arsenal, they fear that other more sinister agendas are at work.</p> <p>When George Bush arrived at work in the governor's mansion in Texas on 30 August 1998 he was already contemplating a presidential run. He was not, however, expecting the call he received from his party's leader on Capitol Hill, Trent Lott.</p> <p>Lott had news for Bush that was being greeted in intelligence circles as ominous. North Korea, said Lott, had successfully tested a medium-range missile capable of reaching targets in Japan. Governor Bush already knew what his response would be were he ever to become president. That test - and the continuing North Korean missile programme - gave him the excuse he needed to make that 'response' official policy. Last week he did just that.</p> <p>The launching of the first generation prototype of the Taepo Dong I by North Korea in August 1998 was a gift for Bush and his supporters in the US defence industry and on the Republican Right. Bush and his allies - many of whom served in the administrations of Ronald Reagan and his own father - shared a common view. The thrust of US policy on nuclear defence under Clinton was all wrong with its focus on negotiated reductions and the administration's reluctance to deploy a National Missile Defence system of the kind that had become an article of faith for Republicans.</p> <p>The battle for supremacy with Russia, they reasoned, had been won. The inheritors of the Soviet Union's formidable nuclear arsenal no longer posed a threat; by implication the ABM treaty was redundant. They were frustrated too by the glacial pace of nuclear disarmament negotiations stalled since the US and Russia signed (but never implemented) the Start 2 treaty in 1993.</p> <p>Instead, they were fixated on the threat posed by China, a nuclear state that was not a signatory to the ABM treaty, and which they suspected of exporting nuclear and missile technology to North Korea, Pakistan, Iran and Iraq. Above all, they shared a belief in the supremacy of US military, economic and technological power that they felt was being hobbled by the collaborative rituals of negotiation that were relics of the Cold War.</p> <p>If any more proof is needed of the new unilateralist mood in Washington, it is provided by evidence that the Bush administration is preparing to scale down - if not abandon - what many regard as the single most important global security programme: the co-operative effort between the US and Russia to slash the vast nuclear arsenal of the former USSR, and prevent proliferation of deadly nuclear materials.</p> <p>The administration has already cut more than $100 million from the $874m spent on co-operation projects with Russia under the auspices of the Department of Energy. More ominously, it has put the programme at the core of the effort - the so called Nunn-Lugar Programme - 'under review'.</p> <p>The project - which has survived all the ups and downs between Washington and Moscow - is named after the two senators who devised and direct the scheme, Republican Richard Lugar and retired Democrat Sam Nunn. It involves hundreds of US officials and contractees working at remote sites to neutralise every instrument of nuclear war.</p> <p>It is due to run until 2007, and has already overseen the destruction of 5,336 warheads, 422 Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles, 367 silos, 425 cruise missiles and almost a fleet of fully-equipped and armed nuclear submarines. It was under this programme that the Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan gave up their nuclear arsenals.</p> <p>The administration's potential threat to the programme has detonated the most serious rebellion against the Bush White House by any senior Republican on any issue. Last week Senator Lugar gave a thunderous speech at a private function warning: 'There are no programmes as critical to US security as those aimed at containing and dismantling the nuclear, chemical and biological warfare infrastructure of the former Soviet Union. The administration must ensure that these efforts are managed efficiently and funded properly'.</p> <p>In the explosion of international anger that greeted Bush's speech, Britain, which has so long cast itself as America's closest ally, has been caught in the crossfire. Despite the encouraging noises of Tony Blair and his spokesman Alastair Campbell over British collaboration with the programme, privately some senior officials and Ministers are deeply concerned.</p> <p>'We are stuck with this one,' said one senior official. 'Bush has made us an offer we can't refuse. The only negotiating position open to us is to say: \"What's in this for us?\" We have to make the best of a bad deal.'</p> <p>The best of that bad deal - say sources - is focused on two British demands: that if Britain permits the upgrading of Fylingdales, then it should also get access to more US intelligence; and over the level of protection that the US would offer Britain under the shield.</p> <p>'It's not an arrangement or a deal,' said a Pentagon source last week commenting on visits by Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon and Foreign Secretary Robin Cook to Washington to discuss the plan. 'It's an accord which is necessary if the missile defence system is to be effectively operative. To be part of the shield is to be part of the intelligence system that supports it.'</p> <p>A British official said: 'Both Hoon and Cook have met and talked over the benefits with their opposite numbers in the new administration. That includes the political, diplomatic and technical issues, although there is concern in Whitehall that while Russia has been embraced, the Chinese have been left in the open.'</p> <p>Indeed, British policy has been moving closer towards the US position all the time. As early as last January, Hoon said he was 'sympathetic' to the US need for National Missile Defence. 'The United Kingdom views a threat to the USA's national security as being a threat to the UK's interests - and vice versa,' he said. 'When the time comes we will weigh up the benefits to the UK.'</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/bush\">Guardian special report: George Bush's America</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Number 26 General Plant in Kanggye in North Korea's Chagang-Do province is a vast underground complex of concrete hangars located in a forbidden zone guarded by the army. It is not marked on any map. The only visible sign of the factory on the surface is seven clusters of buildings linked by a straggle of roads. There are few places on the planet that are more secret. Last week, the uniformed men and women who labour in the workshops and machine rooms at Kanggye found themselves at ground zero in the biggest shake-up for nuclear proliferation policy in a generation. Hidden from the eyes of the world the workers of Kanggye are building North Korea's most sophisticated missile - the Taepo Dong II - a three-stage rocket that the United States believes is capable of hurling a 750 kilo nuclear warhead across the polar wastes to hit western US cities. Last week the Taepo Dong II - unseen, untested and unflown - became the casus belli of America's new 'cold war'. It is the reason - ostensibly at least - why President George W. Bush is preparing to tear up the 30-year-old Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty, cornerstone of all subsequent nuclear treaties. It is the reason why Bush and his hawkish advisers are proposing to spend upwards of $100 billion on a sea, land and space-borne National Missile Defence umbrella - a system explicitly forbidden by the ABM treaty - whose deployment, its many critics say, risks plunging the world into a new era of weapons proliferation and nuclear uncertainty. Ultimately, too, it is the reason for the uncomfortable position that the Government of Tony Blair finds itself in. The plan is dependent on British permission for America to upgrade its radar site at Fylingdales in North Yorkshire. Now Britain is caught between the disapproval of the rest of the world and the insistence of its most important ally. But while Bush and his Pentagon hawks may in the end be wrong in pursuing their National Missile Defence system at risk of established and functioning nuclear treaties, the Taepo Dong II also represents a challenge to the President's critics. For it is one of the most visible signs of how the world has changed since Richard Nixon and Leonid Brezhnev sat down in 1972 and signed the ABM treaty. Then, Warsaw Pact forces occupied half of Europe and the world was still under the shadow of the Cuban missile crisis. If Bush's plans get no further than the Senate floor he has at least opened a crucial - if angry - debate about what nuclear defences and agreements are appropriate for the New World Disorder. On paper the National Missile Defence system should be a nuclear abolitionist's dream: a system designed to make the threat of nuclear weapons once and for all redundant. If it can be made to work it will create a network of satellites, laser-armed Boeing 747s continuously in flight, missile ships and ground missile launchers that would identify and destroy any threatening missile in flight. It is a very big if. 'If this really was an argument for making nuclear weapons obsolete, as Bush implies, then of course anyone would welcome it,' says Dan Plesch of the British American Security Information Centre. 'If there really was a death ray that could destroy nuclear missiles in flight, then who could oppose it? But it is fallible. And if it is fallible it will lead to more, not less, nuclear proliferation. If this system could work infallibly then the nuclear threat, from China, Russia, North Korea, to the US and its allies would be eradicated. Then America would not need nuclear weapons. Bush says that the quid pro quo of installing this system is that America will cut its nuclear arsenal. He is not saying he will abolish it. The logic of that would make the US the only nation on earth whose missiles could hope to hit its enemies.' It is this that is alarming opponents of the NMD. For beneath the US-touted radicalism of a vision that Bush's advisers say would lance the threat of rogue nuclear proliferating states, while making deep unilateral cuts in America's nuclear arsenal, they fear that other more sinister agendas are at work. When George Bush arrived at work in the governor's mansion in Texas on 30 August 1998 he was already contemplating a presidential run. He was not, however, expecting the call he received from his party's leader on Capitol Hill, Trent Lott. Lott had news for Bush that was being greeted in intelligence circles as ominous. North Korea, said Lott, had successfully tested a medium-range missile capable of reaching targets in Japan. Governor Bush already knew what his response would be were he ever to become president. That test - and the continuing North Korean missile programme - gave him the excuse he needed to make that 'response' official policy. Last week he did just that. The launching of the first generation prototype of the Taepo Dong I by North Korea in August 1998 was a gift for Bush and his supporters in the US defence industry and on the Republican Right. Bush and his allies - many of whom served in the administrations of Ronald Reagan and his own father - shared a common view. The thrust of US policy on nuclear defence under Clinton was all wrong with its focus on negotiated reductions and the administration's reluctance to deploy a National Missile Defence system of the kind that had become an article of faith for Republicans. The battle for supremacy with Russia, they reasoned, had been won. The inheritors of the Soviet Union's formidable nuclear arsenal no longer posed a threat; by implication the ABM treaty was redundant. They were frustrated too by the glacial pace of nuclear disarmament negotiations stalled since the US and Russia signed (but never implemented) the Start 2 treaty in 1993. Instead, they were fixated on the threat posed by China, a nuclear state that was not a signatory to the ABM treaty, and which they suspected of exporting nuclear and missile technology to North Korea, Pakistan, Iran and Iraq. Above all, they shared a belief in the supremacy of US military, economic and technological power that they felt was being hobbled by the collaborative rituals of negotiation that were relics of the Cold War. If any more proof is needed of the new unilateralist mood in Washington, it is provided by evidence that the Bush administration is preparing to scale down - if not abandon - what many regard as the single most important global security programme: the co-operative effort between the US and Russia to slash the vast nuclear arsenal of the former USSR, and prevent proliferation of deadly nuclear materials. The administration has already cut more than $100 million from the $874m spent on co-operation projects with Russia under the auspices of the Department of Energy. More ominously, it has put the programme at the core of the effort - the so called Nunn-Lugar Programme - 'under review'. The project - which has survived all the ups and downs between Washington and Moscow - is named after the two senators who devised and direct the scheme, Republican Richard Lugar and retired Democrat Sam Nunn. It involves hundreds of US officials and contractees working at remote sites to neutralise every instrument of nuclear war. It is due to run until 2007, and has already overseen the destruction of 5,336 warheads, 422 Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles, 367 silos, 425 cruise missiles and almost a fleet of fully-equipped and armed nuclear submarines. It was under this programme that the Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan gave up their nuclear arsenals. The administration's potential threat to the programme has detonated the most serious rebellion against the Bush White House by any senior Republican on any issue. Last week Senator Lugar gave a thunderous speech at a private function warning: 'There are no programmes as critical to US security as those aimed at containing and dismantling the nuclear, chemical and biological warfare infrastructure of the former Soviet Union. The administration must ensure that these efforts are managed efficiently and funded properly'. In the explosion of international anger that greeted Bush's speech, Britain, which has so long cast itself as America's closest ally, has been caught in the crossfire. Despite the encouraging noises of Tony Blair and his spokesman Alastair Campbell over British collaboration with the programme, privately some senior officials and Ministers are deeply concerned. 'We are stuck with this one,' said one senior official. 'Bush has made us an offer we can't refuse. The only negotiating position open to us is to say: \"What's in this for us?\" We have to make the best of a bad deal.' The best of that bad deal - say sources - is focused on two British demands: that if Britain permits the upgrading of Fylingdales, then it should also get access to more US intelligence; and over the level of protection that the US would offer Britain under the shield. 'It's not an arrangement or a deal,' said a Pentagon source last week commenting on visits by Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon and Foreign Secretary Robin Cook to Washington to discuss the plan. 'It's an accord which is necessary if the missile defence system is to be effectively operative. To be part of the shield is to be part of the intelligence system that supports it.' A British official said: 'Both Hoon and Cook have met and talked over the benefits with their opposite numbers in the new administration. That includes the political, diplomatic and technical issues, although there is concern in Whitehall that while Russia has been embraced, the Chinese have been left in the open.' Indeed, British policy has been moving closer towards the US position all the time. As early as last January, Hoon said he was 'sympathetic' to the US need for National Missile Defence. 'The United Kingdom views a threat to the USA's national security as being a threat to the UK's interests - and vice versa,' he said. 'When the time comes we will weigh up the benefits to the UK.'

The kibbutzniks expect then to have approval from the government for a shift from collective to private ownership.</p> <p>Other kibbutzim will go the same way, casualties of debt, the inability to retain their young and the complex politics of the conflict with the Palestinians. The kibbutzim (Hebrew for collectives) were once the political and cultural bedrock of Israel, producing many of its top soldiers, politicians and intellectuals. Today, they are marginalised.</p> <p>Zoe Nakar, 52, a Glasgow-born accountant and mother of three who has lived in Mishmar David for more than 30 years, is saddened. Sitting in her kitchen looking out over soft green fields, she said: 'I think it had to happen. I think it will happen in many more kibbutzim. Life has changed and the kibbutz has to change too.'</p> <p>She is nostalgic for the communal life that has all but gone. In a version of socialism brought from eastern Europe, everyone was paid according to their needs rather than job status. The kibbutz provided education and healthcare, as well as clothes, laundry and other basics. The kibbutzniks ate together in a communal dining room, and children slept together under one roof, not with their parents.</p> <p>'It is not an experiment that people tried and did not work,' said Nakar. 'For a long time, it was a solution. You can't call it a failure.'</p> <p>The first kibbutz was founded in 1909. Today, out of an Israeli population of six million, there are 120,000 kibbutzniks, down from 150,000 15 years ago.</p> <p>The signs of decline are all around Mishmar David: rusting farm equipment, disused buildings, unkept gardens. The dining hall and kitchen are abandoned. The kibbutz, which grows corn, avocados and grapes and has printing presses making labels for farm produce from all over Israel, has a collective debt of \u00a318 million.</p> <p>Gavri Vargil, 42, executive director of the Kibbutz Movement, admitted other kibbutzim would end up like Mishmar David, but predicted most would survive.</p> <p>He said there was a political element in the decline. The kibbutzniks voted consistently for Labour: in February's election, 87.3 per cent voted for the Labour leader, Ehud Barak, and only 13.7 for the Likud candidate and eventual Prime Minister, Ariel Sharon.</p> <p>Vargil said Likud, in power for most of the last 20 years, had been disastrous. Knowing there were few votes to be had among them, Likud spent billions of pounds that might have gone to preserve the kibbutzim, which are all within Israel proper, on expanding Jewish settlements on the West Bank and Gaza Strip, one of the main causes of friction with the Palestinians.</p> <p>Mishmar David lies in the centre of the country, near Rehovot, south of Tel Aviv. It was set up by Romanian survivors of the Holocaust and former Israeli soldiers.</p> <p>It had an influx of British immigrants in the Seventies. One of them, Mike Skyte, 47, deputy manager of the printing press, who left Leeds 24 years ago, said the decision to disband the kibbutz had been put to a vote and only one had voted against.</p> <p>The intention was to build 350 new homes on what was agricultural land to sell to outsiders and pay off the debt. The rest of the land will be returned to the state.</p> <p>Members will keep their own homes and be given shares in the print works. They will then be on their own, the same as every other Israeli citizen, without the safety net of the kibbutz.</p> <p>Shalom Nakar, 62, who was originally from Iraq and works on the printing press, regrets the disappearance of the old ways. 'Today, there is more ego and less togetherness, less and less social life together, fewer people to come to committees to discuss important things. They prefer to watch television.'</p> <p>The communal dining-room served breakfast, lunch and supper, then only lunch, and was closed down altogether in 1994. Two years ago, the members ended the system of each being paid according to need and gave people the option of having salaries, which most have taken.</p> <p>Throughout Israel, the number of travellers visiting the kibbutzim has shrunk from 12,000 a year 30 years ago to 6,000-7,000 last year and, because of the intifada, down to only 500 in the first four months of this year. Skyte said Mishmar David had stopped taking temporary kibbutzniks 10 years ago because they treated it like a holiday: only two had ever stayed on.</p> <p>In the kibbutz shop, Oren Singer, 16, was minding the till. He was sorry the communal way of life was coming to an end but said: 'This place is in the middle of nowhere. There are not many people my age. There is nothing to do.' Although brought up on the kibbutz, his parents are British. 'I think I might go and live in England,' he said.</p> <p>Skyte said the early Zionist intellectuals had advocated that the Jews try to become like other nations rather than be different. But the kibbutzniks dared to be different.</p> <p>He was sorry he and the others at Mishmar David had failed: 'We all wanted to be something special.'</p> <p><b> 'Today there is more ego and there is less togetherness... people prefer to watch television'</b> Shalom Nakar</p>",

The kibbutzniks expect then to have approval from the government for a shift from collective to private ownership. Other kibbutzim will go the same way, casualties of debt, the inability to retain their young and the complex politics of the conflict with the Palestinians. The kibbutzim (Hebrew for collectives) were once the political and cultural bedrock of Israel, producing many of its top soldiers, politicians and intellectuals. Today, they are marginalised. Zoe Nakar, 52, a Glasgow-born accountant and mother of three who has lived in Mishmar David for more than 30 years, is saddened. Sitting in her kitchen looking out over soft green fields, she said: 'I think it had to happen. I think it will happen in many more kibbutzim. Life has changed and the kibbutz has to change too.' She is nostalgic for the communal life that has all but gone. In a version of socialism brought from eastern Europe, everyone was paid according to their needs rather than job status. The kibbutz provided education and healthcare, as well as clothes, laundry and other basics. The kibbutzniks ate together in a communal dining room, and children slept together under one roof, not with their parents. 'It is not an experiment that people tried and did not work,' said Nakar. 'For a long time, it was a solution. You can't call it a failure.' The first kibbutz was founded in 1909. Today, out of an Israeli population of six million, there are 120,000 kibbutzniks, down from 150,000 15 years ago. The signs of decline are all around Mishmar David: rusting farm equipment, disused buildings, unkept gardens. The dining hall and kitchen are abandoned. The kibbutz, which grows corn, avocados and grapes and has printing presses making labels for farm produce from all over Israel, has a collective debt of \u00a318 million. Gavri Vargil, 42, executive director of the Kibbutz Movement, admitted other kibbutzim would end up like Mishmar David, but predicted most would survive. He said there was a political element in the decline. The kibbutzniks voted consistently for Labour: in February's election, 87.3 per cent voted for the Labour leader, Ehud Barak, and only 13.7 for the Likud candidate and eventual Prime Minister, Ariel Sharon. Vargil said Likud, in power for most of the last 20 years, had been disastrous. Knowing there were few votes to be had among them, Likud spent billions of pounds that might have gone to preserve the kibbutzim, which are all within Israel proper, on expanding Jewish settlements on the West Bank and Gaza Strip, one of the main causes of friction with the Palestinians. Mishmar David lies in the centre of the country, near Rehovot, south of Tel Aviv. It was set up by Romanian survivors of the Holocaust and former Israeli soldiers. It had an influx of British immigrants in the Seventies. One of them, Mike Skyte, 47, deputy manager of the printing press, who left Leeds 24 years ago, said the decision to disband the kibbutz had been put to a vote and only one had voted against. The intention was to build 350 new homes on what was agricultural land to sell to outsiders and pay off the debt. The rest of the land will be returned to the state. Members will keep their own homes and be given shares in the print works. They will then be on their own, the same as every other Israeli citizen, without the safety net of the kibbutz. Shalom Nakar, 62, who was originally from Iraq and works on the printing press, regrets the disappearance of the old ways. 'Today, there is more ego and less togetherness, less and less social life together, fewer people to come to committees to discuss important things. They prefer to watch television.' The communal dining-room served breakfast, lunch and supper, then only lunch, and was closed down altogether in 1994. Two years ago, the members ended the system of each being paid according to need and gave people the option of having salaries, which most have taken. Throughout Israel, the number of travellers visiting the kibbutzim has shrunk from 12,000 a year 30 years ago to 6,000-7,000 last year and, because of the intifada, down to only 500 in the first four months of this year. Skyte said Mishmar David had stopped taking temporary kibbutzniks 10 years ago because they treated it like a holiday: only two had ever stayed on. In the kibbutz shop, Oren Singer, 16, was minding the till. He was sorry the communal way of life was coming to an end but said: 'This place is in the middle of nowhere. There are not many people my age. There is nothing to do.' Although brought up on the kibbutz, his parents are British. 'I think I might go and live in England,' he said. Skyte said the early Zionist intellectuals had advocated that the Jews try to become like other nations rather than be different. But the kibbutzniks dared to be different. He was sorry he and the others at Mishmar David had failed: 'We all wanted to be something special.' 'Today there is more ego and there is less togetherness... people prefer to watch television' Shalom Nakar",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Take a few seconds to think about this: is uncensored sex more or less acceptable with an English accent? The question was raised by something Sue Clark of the British Board of Film Classification said about Intimacy, a film destined, at least for a while, to be known as 'that film with the blow-job in it'. </p> <p>This is what Clark said: 'Audiences may be used to seeing explicit sex scenes in foreign language films, such as The Idiots, which is Danish, and the Japanese film Ai No Corrida [In the Realm of the Senses], but this is the first time many will see such scenes in an English-language movie.' </p> <p>Given that a wave of sexually explicit films in English is coming our way - The Center of the World , Killing Me Softly, Better Than Sex and Intimacy, which is based on Hanif Kureishi's writings - the question is now relevant in a way it hasn't been since the Seventies. Could it be true that people were happier with mysterious foreigners having real sex on film? </p> <p>I asked Clark to clarify her statement. 'I thought some people might find the fact that it was in English meant the film had more impact on them. I wasn't suggesting that the language made a difference, except in the sense that if something is in a foreign language with actors you don't recognise you can slightly distance yourself from what's happening, whereas if it's in English with people you recognise and bus routes you recognise, possibly, you become more involved with the film and might find it more startling.' </p> <p>While it is true that recent landmarks in cinema sex involved the anonymous orgyists in Lars Von Trier's The Idiots or the busman's holidaying porn stars of French shocker Romance, in Intimacy that's Globe Theatre artistic director Mark Rylance and Shallow Grave star Kerry Fox naked and exposed on a grubby carpet in New Cross. It is awkward and it is meant to be. </p> <p>'I think sex is always difficult,' Kureishi says, 'not only for everybody in real life, but also to look at in the cinema. It's always frightening, it's always a problem and, despite the fact that people seem to talk about it a lot, and there have been dozens of films about it, the subject is never done. Somehow, violence is always easier; you always know where you stand with violence. But I think sexuality is a problem and will go on being one, whether it is Japanese, French or German.' </p> <p>This much is clear: we are in an age when the boundaries of sex in the cinema are being pushed with an enthusiasm not seen since the mid-Seventies. Although the trend started in Europe, it has arrived in the traditionally more censorious English-speaking world, albeit with the help of foreigners such as Intimacy director Patrice Chereau. The Center of the World, directed by Wayne Wang and co-written by Paul Auster, will be showing at Cannes. Chinese director Chen Kaige has recently completed shooting the S&amp;M-tinged Killing Me Softly in London with the starry pairing of Joseph Fiennes and Heather Graham. </p> <p>And the highlight of the recent Australian Film Festival in London was Better Than Sex, which in a far cheerier way asks one of the same questions as Intimacy: what happens to a couple when just having pounding sex is no longer enough? </p> <p>The feeling that something is going on is amplified in Britain by the fact that we can now see these films uncut. It seems like a taboo is being broken every month, with formerly unviewable erect penises sailing past the censor. As far as the British Board of Film Classification is concerned, non-violent sex in 18-certificate films stays in. 'We certainly found from our research last year that the public felt it was an issue we could leave to them, rather than interfering,' Clark explains. 'They should be the ones who decide whether they want to watch films like that. Provided that the sex doesn't involve violence or coercion towards one of the partners, we are much more relaxed about allowing it through, based on the fact that that's what the public told us they wanted.' </p> <p>In the US, meanwhile, filmmakers like Wang are increasingly ignoring the ratings system altogether and releasing their films uncut and uncer tified. But The Center of the World had trouble with its trailers. </p> <p>'We had to cut the trailer for this film because no theatre would play it,' Wang says. 'It has Molly Parker looking at herself in the mirror saying, \"I have the hottest, wettest, tightest pussy\". It's a quote from some book about stripping that girls use to pump themselves up. Nobody would show it. At the same time, you've got all this porn out there.' </p> <p> The Center of the World follows the relationship between a dotcom millionaire (Peter Sarsgaard) and a stripper (Molly Parker) in a Vegas hotel room. It is the most serious explicit film made in the US in a long time, even if Wang never convinced his stars to engage in unsimulated sex for him. </p> <p>'They both felt they did not want to do fake sex, like on the Playboy Channel. They wanted to make it as real as possible. The issue became whether they were really going to do it or not. In the end, they didn't. I was prepared to ask them to do it for real. At one point, I was kind of pushing for it because it really pushed the reality of what was going on between these two characters. The point of the movie is what is real about sex and what is fantasy.' </p> <p>Like Intimacy, Wang's movie isn't much fun. Both fit into the tradition established by Last Tango in Paris that the more explicit an arthouse movie is the less appealing sex seems. No one would watch The Idiots or Romance to get their kicks. It's not just a question of more honest lighting or casting. Intimacy , especially, shares with Last Tango the way the sex takes place in grubby surroundings between characters who are deeply unhappy. Rylance and Fox play a couple who meet every Wednesday and have silent, anonymous sex. </p> <p>'These people are using sex as an anaesthetic, as a way of forgetting themselves,' Kureishi says. 'It's not a happy fuck. The film is interested in what people use sex to do, as a way of not speaking. As a way of eliminating social intercourse as opposed to sexual intercourse, as a way of not facing other needs you might have, to have conversations with one another, or just to hold one another. In this film, though, they do get to become interested in one another.' </p> <p>While Last Tango had pudgy old Brando and young, beautiful Maria Schneider, Rylance is 40 and Fox 34. 'The sexuality isn't glamorised,' says Kureishi. 'These aren't particularly beautiful people. I'm interested in sexual relationships between older people.' </p> <p>Sometimes, though, you can't help wondering whether the effects of relaxing censorship are all good. The now notorious oral sex scene in Intimacy isn't actually vital to the story. By that point in the film, the audience already understands that the two characters are overcome by self-loathing lust and have seen them having sex several times. The fellatio scene seems to be there just because it could be. </p> <p>Too much sex can get in the way of filmmaking: Last Tango in Paris is by far the worst film Bernardo Bertolucci made in the early Seventies and by some way the most famous. It seems like testing the limits means more to the people making the film than the needs of their audience. This is Heather Graham talking about Killing Me Softly: 'Some people were telling me that perhaps I should not do such a darkly erotic film, but I have to accept that this stuff just interests me. I like to think I am comfortable with my own sexuality. It is a risk, but I have become braver with each film so far.' </p> <p>But the main reason why you won't often see actors engaging in prolonged, starkly-lit sex (whether in English or subtitled) at your local multiplex is this: in the cinema, explicit sex doesn't actually sell - not with the more private and focused pleasures of video and internet porn to compete with. Even trashier, big budget outings like Showgirls bombed. The more thoughtful - and more explicit - The Center of the World has drawn a fraction of the audience Wayne Wang got for the weepy family saga, The Joy Luck Club. </p> <p>So when it comes to the big screen, it seems most of us don't actually want to see ever more honest, ground-breaking depictions of sex.

      "bodyText": "Take a few seconds to think about this: is uncensored sex more or less acceptable with an English accent? The question was raised by something Sue Clark of the British Board of Film Classification said about Intimacy, a film destined, at least for a while, to be known as 'that film with the blow-job in it'. This is what Clark said: 'Audiences may be used to seeing explicit sex scenes in foreign language films, such as The Idiots, which is Danish, and the Japanese film Ai No Corrida [In the Realm of the Senses], but this is the first time many will see such scenes in an English-language movie.' Given that a wave of sexually explicit films in English is coming our way - The Center of the World , Killing Me Softly, Better Than Sex and Intimacy, which is based on Hanif Kureishi's writings - the question is now relevant in a way it hasn't been since the Seventies. Could it be true that people were happier with mysterious foreigners having real sex on film? I asked Clark to clarify her statement. 'I thought some people might find the fact that it was in English meant the film had more impact on them. I wasn't suggesting that the language made a difference, except in the sense that if something is in a foreign language with actors you don't recognise you can slightly distance yourself from what's happening, whereas if it's in English with people you recognise and bus routes you recognise, possibly, you become more involved with the film and might find it more startling.' While it is true that recent landmarks in cinema sex involved the anonymous orgyists in Lars Von Trier's The Idiots or the busman's holidaying porn stars of French shocker Romance, in Intimacy that's Globe Theatre artistic director Mark Rylance and Shallow Grave star Kerry Fox naked and exposed on a grubby carpet in New Cross. It is awkward and it is meant to be. 'I think sex is always difficult,' Kureishi says, 'not only for everybody in real life, but also to look at in the cinema. It's always frightening, it's always a problem and, despite the fact that people seem to talk about it a lot, and there have been dozens of films about it, the subject is never done. Somehow, violence is always easier; you always know where you stand with violence. But I think sexuality is a problem and will go on being one, whether it is Japanese, French or German.' This much is clear: we are in an age when the boundaries of sex in the cinema are being pushed with an enthusiasm not seen since the mid-Seventies. Although the trend started in Europe, it has arrived in the traditionally more censorious English-speaking world, albeit with the help of foreigners such as Intimacy director Patrice Chereau. The Center of the World, directed by Wayne Wang and co-written by Paul Auster, will be showing at Cannes. Chinese director Chen Kaige has recently completed shooting the S&amp;M-tinged Killing Me Softly in London with the starry pairing of Joseph Fiennes and Heather Graham. And the highlight of the recent Australian Film Festival in London was Better Than Sex, which in a far cheerier way asks one of the same questions as Intimacy: what happens to a couple when just having pounding sex is no longer enough? The feeling that something is going on is amplified in Britain by the fact that we can now see these films uncut. It seems like a taboo is being broken every month, with formerly unviewable erect penises sailing past the censor. As far as the British Board of Film Classification is concerned, non-violent sex in 18-certificate films stays in. 'We certainly found from our research last year that the public felt it was an issue we could leave to them, rather than interfering,' Clark explains. 'They should be the ones who decide whether they want to watch films like that. Provided that the sex doesn't involve violence or coercion towards one of the partners, we are much more relaxed about allowing it through, based on the fact that that's what the public told us they wanted.' In the US, meanwhile, filmmakers like Wang are increasingly ignoring the ratings system altogether and releasing their films uncut and uncer tified.

The Center of the World follows the relationship between a dotcom millionaire (Peter Sarsgaard) and a stripper (Molly Parker) in a Vegas hotel room. It is the most serious explicit film made in the US in a long time, even if Wang never convinced his stars to engage in unsimulated sex for him.

      "trailText": "<p><strong>Peter Preston:</strong> John Madden's version of Louis de Berni&egrave;res's novel is no outright disaster... The difficulty is in the might-have-beens</p>",
      "byline": "Peter Preston",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>What happens when a big bestseller - full of rich characters, subplots, history and narrative drive - turns into a big (budget) movie? Captain Corelli breaks a string on his mandolin, that's what. Most of the richness, maybe inevitably, is declared surplus to screenplay requirements. Only the central core of romance remains - and that, denuded of supporting ingredients, seems thin and overblown. It drags itself into life: it does not drive. </p> <p>But pause, first, in search of a fair precision. John Madden's version of Louis de Berni\u00e8res's novel is no outright disaster. Cephalonia looks beautiful. So does Pen\u00e9lope Cruz. The action sequences towards the end are expertly handled. You won't - especially if you're one of the three people on earth who hasn't read the book - stagger out of the stalls feeling short-changed. You may even contrive a glycerine smear of a tear. The difficulty is in the might-have-beens. </p> <p>It might (just might) have been possible to keep some of the texture - which means the believability and thus human warmth - of the original. But Shawn Slovo's script never begins to meet that test. Problem one: what language are this ostensible collection of Greeks, Italians and Germans supposed to be talking? Slovo and Madden settle for an all-purpose Eastern Med Esperanto, otherwise dee Eenglish with daa flexeebly transferable accent. Zorbaspeak. That makes any trip into the colloquial fraught with peril. When Corelli, as interpreter, tries to negotiate the surrender of the mayor and town council, what do they say? They say: 'fuck off.' Catch the first bus back to Camden town, mate. The words, time and again, get in the way. </p> <p>So does the casting. Of course you need stars - you can't live at the box office without them - but internationalism on this scale verges on the ridiculous. An American (Nicolas Cage) as the lead Italian; a Spaniard (Cruz) as the Greek heroine with an Englishman (John Hurt) as her dad and a Welshman (Christian Bale) as her Ionian peasant lover, plus standard Brits doing their Nazi strut as Germans and real Greeks filling in the cracks in between. Problem two: your real Greeks don't look remotely like your phoney Greeks. Wrong colour, wrong bone structure - the differences fill the screen. </p> <p>Try sinking yourself in the plot, then. Cephalonia 1941; the Italians - an effete gang of opera-loving layabouts - are the main force of occupation. Captain Corelli, a gentle soul who specialises in barber-shop Rossini as well as mandolin plucking, gets billetted with the fragrant Cruz and her wise old doctor dad while Bale is fighting Hitler in the North. Love does its blooming thing. Bale comes back looking baleful. Mussolini throws in the towel as the Germans turn murderously on their erstwhile allies. Add an earthquake for luck and consider: who emotes, wins. The hacking down of de Berni\u00e8res - changed ending, editing so brutal that at least one crucial character, the gay Carlo who saves Corelli from the firing squad, becomes inexplicable - doesn't help. Nor does the truncation of real history and real time passing into a few glib devices. But then, gradually, it becomes evident that Madden may be trying to bypass all the difficulties and make a picture which - at heart - has very little to do with the book. </p> <p>Consider his deliberately lush visual style, a constant orchestrating of sun, rocks and flowers. Who does that remind you of? Partly Claude Berri doing over Pagnol for Depardieu and Emmanuelle Beart, but most insistently this is late David Lean, this is Ryan's Daughter \u00e0 la Greque. Lean had Robert Mitchum, Leo McKern, Sarah Miles and John Mills all turning on the (pretty ludicrous) Oirish, though variously transported from LA, Oz or SW5 - but nobody cared at the time. Here was Romance with sumptuous strings, and a few tremors of the Troubles dropped in for luck. Begin with cliffs, crags, the eternal sea and simple folk fuelled by simple longings and you couldn't go wrong. Synthetic settings with synthetic castings didn't matter if the hankies got drenched anyway. </p> <p>Madden dutifully follows his French and English mas ters. Most of the interior shots have that Berri gloss, superior Stella Artois without a foot on the beer pump. Get the camera outside and it constantly soars (with Stephen Warbeck's strings). There's very little attempt at specific realism. Cruz is forever wandering through the glades gathering flowers or fruit in a crisp new cotton smock (from Knightsbridge, \u00a3200 and up). Cage's lurches into comedy are as over the top as John Mills's loony fisherman. Here is a nowhere island, Ruritania meets Illyria before the tempest of violence. Does Hurt, perhaps, carry a Prospero's wand in his GP's bag? </p> <p>At this level, after its fashion, Captain Corelli survives gentle scrutiny. If you're not supposed to believe, then settle for a wallow through what you're supposed to appreciate. Will Cage win another Oscar? (Somebody thinks so: the US release comes only with autumn). He doesn't quite deserve to because the lighter, extrovert Corelli is beyond gelling with that blank face best suited for introversion and pain. But give him a nomination for ambition beyond the call of duty. </p> <p>Is Cruz the next great female star? She's grown thin and birdlike here (almost the only sign of a wartime Cephalonia on short rations) but she remains luminous, with eyes that well with sadness and a mouth that quivers into wondrous malleability. Europe's answer to Julia Roberts. She - and the brooding Hurt - bring a touch of class. Now give her another comedy like Woman on Top and a square meal. </p> <p>Back to basics, though. Some books are made to be movies, some are not. The inescapable truth about Captain Corelli's Mandolin, whatever its printed allure, is that a successful cinematic transition is almost certainly a bridge too far. The essence doesn't condense. Cut away and there are only loose ends. John Madden has tried, then, to do something else - and he's not enough of a distinctive hand to pull it off entirely. A gallant failure? Better than that: more a flawed, derivative, but occasionally rousing entertainment. </p> <p>Go expecting little and you may be pleasantly surprised (especially as the second half gathers pace). Go expecting a British masterpiece to recapture the great days of epic romance and hype kebabs hope. Does the earth move here? Only on seismic orders from special effects - and nobody on a decent salary gets hurt.</p>",

      "bodyText": "What happens when a big bestseller - full of rich characters, subplots, history and narrative drive - turns into a big (budget) movie? Captain Corelli breaks a string on his mandolin, that's what. Most of the richness, maybe inevitably, is declared surplus to screenplay requirements. Only the central core of romance remains - and that, denuded of supporting ingredients, seems thin and overblown. It drags itself into life: it does not drive. But pause, first, in search of a fair precision. John Madden's version of Louis de Berni\u00e8res's novel is no outright disaster. Cephalonia looks beautiful. So does Pen\u00e9lope Cruz. The action sequences towards the end are expertly handled. You won't - especially if you're one of the three people on earth who hasn't read the book - stagger out of the stalls feeling short-changed. You may even contrive a glycerine smear of a tear. The difficulty is in the might-have-beens. It might (just might) have been possible to keep some of the texture - which means the believability and thus human warmth - of the original. But Shawn Slovo's script never begins to meet that test. Problem one: what language are this ostensible collection of Greeks, Italians and Germans supposed to be talking? Slovo and Madden settle for an all-purpose Eastern Med Esperanto, otherwise dee Eenglish with daa flexeebly transferable accent. Zorbaspeak. That makes any trip into the colloquial fraught with peril. When Corelli, as interpreter, tries to negotiate the surrender of the mayor and town council, what do they say? They say: 'fuck off.' Catch the first bus back to Camden town, mate. The words, time and again, get in the way. So does the casting. Of course you need stars - you can't live at the box office without them - but internationalism on this scale verges on the ridiculous. An American (Nicolas Cage) as the lead Italian; a Spaniard (Cruz) as the Greek heroine with an Englishman (John Hurt) as her dad and a Welshman (Christian Bale) as her Ionian peasant lover, plus standard Brits doing their Nazi strut as Germans and real Greeks filling in the cracks in between. Problem two: your real Greeks don't look remotely like your phoney Greeks. Wrong colour, wrong bone structure - the differences fill the screen. Try sinking yourself in the plot, then. Cephalonia 1941; the Italians - an effete gang of opera-loving layabouts - are the main force of occupation. Captain Corelli, a gentle soul who specialises in barber-shop Rossini as well as mandolin plucking, gets billetted with the fragrant Cruz and her wise old doctor dad while Bale is fighting Hitler in the North. Love does its blooming thing. Bale comes back looking baleful. Mussolini throws in the towel as the Germans turn murderously on their erstwhile allies. Add an earthquake for luck and consider: who emotes, wins. The hacking down of de Berni\u00e8res - changed ending, editing so brutal that at least one crucial character, the gay Carlo who saves Corelli from the firing squad, becomes inexplicable - doesn't help. Nor does the truncation of real history and real time passing into a few glib devices. But then, gradually, it becomes evident that Madden may be trying to bypass all the difficulties and make a picture which - at heart - has very little to do with the book. Consider his deliberately lush visual style, a constant orchestrating of sun, rocks and flowers. Who does that remind you of? Partly Claude Berri doing over Pagnol for Depardieu and Emmanuelle Beart, but most insistently this is late David Lean, this is Ryan's Daughter \u00e0 la Greque. Lean had Robert Mitchum, Leo McKern, Sarah Miles and John Mills all turning on the (pretty ludicrous) Oirish, though variously transported from LA, Oz or SW5 - but nobody cared at the time. Here was Romance with sumptuous strings, and a few tremors of the Troubles dropped in for luck. Begin with cliffs, crags, the eternal sea and simple folk fuelled by simple longings and you couldn't go wrong. Synthetic settings with synthetic castings didn't matter if the hankies got drenched anyway. Madden dutifully follows his French and English mas ters. Most of the interior shots have that Berri gloss, superior Stella Artois without a foot on the beer pump. Get the camera outside and it constantly soars (with Stephen Warbeck's strings). There's very little attempt at specific realism. Cruz is forever wandering through the glades gathering flowers or fruit in a crisp new cotton smock (from Knightsbridge, \u00a3200 and up). Cage's lurches into comedy are as over the top as John Mills's loony fisherman. Here is a nowhere island, Ruritania meets Illyria before the tempest of violence. Does Hurt, perhaps, carry a Prospero's wand in his GP's bag? At this level, after its fashion, Captain Corelli survives gentle scrutiny. If you're not supposed to believe, then settle for a wallow through what you're supposed to appreciate. Will Cage win another Oscar? (Somebody thinks so: the US release comes only with autumn). He doesn't quite deserve to because the lighter, extrovert Corelli is beyond gelling with that blank face best suited for introversion and pain. But give him a nomination for ambition beyond the call of duty. Is Cruz the next great female star? She's grown thin and birdlike here (almost the only sign of a wartime Cephalonia on short rations) but she remains luminous, with eyes that well with sadness and a mouth that quivers into wondrous malleability. Europe's answer to Julia Roberts. She - and the brooding Hurt - bring a touch of class. Now give her another comedy like Woman on Top and a square meal. Back to basics, though. Some books are made to be movies, some are not. The inescapable truth about Captain Corelli's Mandolin, whatever its printed allure, is that a successful cinematic transition is almost certainly a bridge too far. The essence doesn't condense. Cut away and there are only loose ends. John Madden has tried, then, to do something else - and he's not enough of a distinctive hand to pull it off entirely. A gallant failure? Better than that: more a flawed, derivative, but occasionally rousing entertainment. Go expecting little and you may be pleasantly surprised (especially as the second half gathers pace). Go expecting a British masterpiece to recapture the great days of epic romance and hype kebabs hope. Does the earth move here? Only on seismic orders from special effects - and nobody on a decent salary gets hurt.",

      "body": "<p>Michael Winner is wearing a tan from Morocco, a shirt from Gstaad and his heart on his sleeve. Is it possible that a man whose entire career is founded on provocation can be quite so sensitive? If it is sometimes difficult to evaluate the contribution Michael Winner has made to the worlds of film and journalism, this is because of the clouds of dust he stirs up as he passes, at speed, leaning on the horn of his \u00a347,000 Mercedes. </p> <p>Winner likes to live up to his name and that gets up people's noses. 'To me, expensive is buying a \u00a34-million painting, a jet plane or ordering a \u00a36,000 bottle of wine,' he remarked recently, to the sound of much gnashing of teeth. </p> <p>There seems much to loathe about Michael Winner: his Toadish pleasure in his wealth ('If I could go back, I would spend much more, earlier. No question. This sounds absolutely crass, but I would have taken private planes earlier, would have had a chauffeur and better cars earlier, I'd have bought better paintings earlier'), the name-dropping in his Sunday Times restaurant column, the reputation he has for throwing his weight around. And, last but not least, the rubbishy later films. </p> <p>Winner, who is in a sunny and avuncular mood today, likes to remember the good reviews, not the bad, but even he has to admit that not all have been favourable. 'Of course I've had some real stinkers,' he concedes eventually, adding, rather darkly, that he believes his peculiar form of celebrity has cast a long shadow over his last few productions. Recently, he says, the critics have had 'a real go at me, not at the movies'. It's a fabulously self-aggrandising theory, one that will doubtless be further developed in his forthcoming autobiography. </p> <p>And it's poppycock. Critics and cinema audiences alike can overlook all sorts of weaknesses in a director who produces the goods; think of Roman Polanski or Woody Allen. But no, we should not give 1998's Parting Shots (described by one critic as being 'about as entertaining as a boil on the bottom') a second chance. As for its director... well, after a jolly morning at Winner Towers, I could quite imagine how he managed to persuade so many of his famous chums (Bob Hoskins, Ben Kingsley, John Cleese, Diana Rigg) to join him on this infamous voyage down the plughole. Such is his knowing, twinkling absurdity that you too would gladly join him on the Titanic. </p> <p>Not that Winner himself is the forgiving type. Two types of people excite his wrath during our chat. First: the people who write to the Sunday Times saying they've spotted him behaving badly somewhere or other. Telling me about one man who accused him of refusing to sign a copy of Winner's Dinners, the collected works, on Concorde, Winner gets very agitated. 'Eventually we wrote to this man. It's very rare that we write back. But I remembered this man - he nodded at me! This man never showed me a book - it was a nod!' </p> <p>Winner, 65, must put as much cash aside for postage as for pool maintenance. He's famous for firing off reproaches to people who are rude about him in print, as well as some who are not. Under the impression that Jane Bown, The Observer photographer, had said something nasty about him in the Guardian, he dispatched a reprimand. Then it turned out he hadn't read the story properly and had confused her with someone else. So he sent her an apology and, when she turned up to take the photograph for this piece, presented her with an enormous bunch of peonies. </p> <p>The other sort of people he resents are those who allege he is irascible on set. I read him a quote from Nicola Bryant, an actress who said the atmosphere on Parting Shots was 'creatively a very sterile situation. I think that a lot of creativity was screamed out of people'. </p> <p>'Oh, bollocks!' explodes Winner, giving a fair impression of irascibility. 'Nicola Bryant was on for two days! She was never screamed at! We do not scream on set! Absolute nonsense! I'm not saying that in the course of a whole movie, eight weeks, I don't very occasionally lose my temper about something, but never with the actors. She may have said it to draw attention to herself.' Later, he faxes me a handwritten note from the production's hairdresser: 'There was no shouting at all. It was a very quiet two days.' </p> <p>I want to know his theory about his reputation. There is a long pause, a rare vacuum, of at least 10 seconds. 'You know, years ago, when I was directing The System, and Nicolas Roeg was the cameraman, he said, \"Michael, you look as if you're enjoying it. You'll never get anywhere if you look as if you're enjoying it. You've got to look as if you're suffering\".' </p> <p>Roeg was bang on the money. Winner is conspicuously pleased with his lot. But he thinks there's more to it than this. 'If you've made 40 movies with some of the biggest stars in the world, you are bound to attract attention. I am,' he adds in a long-suffering tone, 'extremely shy.' </p> <p>Oh, please. </p> <p>'Darling! I am extremely shy! I am two people! I put on an act! I hardly go out, I am so shy!' </p> <p>The reclusive, self-effacing Michael Winner has a lovely life. His friend Marlon Brando's icebreaker is to ask people how happy they have been, marks out of 10, over the last 12 months. Winner's own score for the last year is 'a weak seven. If you can achieve a weak seven in the real world without lying to yourself, that's not bad'. </p> <p>It's not, is it? </p> <p>Since breaking through what he calls 'the fear barrier' about six years ago, he has stopped worrying about his professional standing and now counts both the films (there's a new horror flick in the pipeline) and the journalism as hobbies: 'Everything's a hobby!' </p> <p>His is a fastidiously hedonistic existence, tweaked just so: shedloads of cash, antiques, Lear jets on standby and a 30-year-old Bulgarian girlfriend called Georgina who pops over in the evenings to keep him company in what Bob Geldof has described as 'the best house in Holland Park', where the cushions are kept in a constant state of tumescence by his five full-time dailies. </p> <p>The house, bankrolled by some shrewd property investments and the profits from the Death Wish movies, will be Winner's monument; in the absence of an heir, he intends to leave it to the nation. Designed by Norman Shaw for the Victorian artist Sir Luke Fildes, it was converted into flats by Winner's father, George, after the war. Winner has devoted most of his adult life to restoring it. </p> <p>He tells me that he asked his interior designer, Tessa Kennedy, to give it a country-house feel, but he thinks some of the downstairs rooms are really more lottery-winners' country house. I suspect it's just the way he wants it. It's nothing like a family home, more a bachelor pad along the proportions of Versailles, with some comfy touches: two large oils of him on the stairs and an impressive number of Winnie the Pooh and Arthur Rackham originals. </p> <p>Winner has often played up to the lost-boy theory and the references to childhood come thick and fast; most of the 40-something rooms appear to be inhabited solely by stuffed animals. There are eight bears and Humpties in his vast bedroom, along with five telephones, three arrangements of stargazer lilies and two televisions. </p> <p>When he agrees to give me the famous tour, his pride in the house is set against a cultivated carelessness. Entering one of the sitting-rooms, he throws open the French windows that lead on to the garden. When he moves on, I start fumbling to close them, to keep the heat in, but Winner looks at me as if I'm bonkers and says I really shouldn't bother, someone will be coming round to tidy up after us in a moment. </p> <p>The same thing happens with the piped music in the steam-room and the lights that illuminate the indoor pool - he leaves them on, because he can. It is rather grotesque, as is his habit of bellowing 'Dinah!' over the banisters when he wants assistance from his receptionist. But, oh, it is mysteriously difficult to dislike a man who remarks: 'Oh yes, the dear departeds' when you spot, in one of the nine bathrooms, a table bristling with framed photographs of his exes. </p> <p> There are photographs everywhere. When I ask about his mother, Helen, he presses her likeness into my hand. 'Absolutely beautiful. Spoke like a duchess. There she is, bless her. Nice, little, white-haired lady. She was a killer. If she decided she wasn't happy about something, she was acid.' </p> <p>Winner doesn't say much about his father, a north London property developer who assembled quite a fortune, but he talks about his mother, who lost most of it at a Cannes casino, with fascination and awe. She never gave him much attention when he was a small and odd-sounding boy (at 14, he was writing a syndicated newspaper column and interviewing people like Louis Armstrong but she was always more interested in the previous night's poker scores). </p> <p>After George's death, in 1972, things turned nasty. Having gambled away \u00a38m, she pursued her son's inheritance through the courts, getting through 11 firms of solicitors. At one point, she made over her jewellery to her son but then soon afterwards told a friend that he had stolen it and she was going to the police. When he rang up to confront her, she asked if she could have it back. 'So I said, \"Of course you can have it back, dear, I'll bring it back immediately\". And that, I must say, for some reason made me feel that I couldn't take it anymore. It was too painful.' He spoke to her on the phone (she never knew how upset he was and wouldn't have remembered it anyway) for the next six months and then she died. 'I definitely loved her,' he says, sadly. </p> <p>The evidence suggests that Winner has never been quite so sure of his feelings for anyone else. He tends to keep his lady friends at arm's length - only one ('Seagrove') actually moved in. He met Georgina eight years ago when she applied, unsuccessfully, to become his receptionist, but they only started stepping out in 1999, when his last girlfriend, Vanessa, decided the party was over and she wanted a family (Winner has a low sperm count). </p> <p>'I remembered Georgina and called her, as one does if one is a lonely bachelor, which I have been for longer than almost anyone else on the planet. However pathetic you may be, you still try to make dates. It's that or watch the spin-dryer.' </p> <p>Ageing, he says, isn't fun. He is offended by his stomach in the mirror ('I think, \"How dare you look like that?\"') and would be lost without his three hair restoratives (he's very proud of his cloudy white coif, and says that one of his worst habits is combing it in restaurants). Every time a relationship ends, and he seems to be fairly passive in the break-ups, he feels less alluring. 'It becomes more frightening. I used to think I was always very ugly, but when I look at old photographs I see that I was actually very beautiful. And every year you're getting older and fatter. Yeah, I think I have reached a point now where I'd quite like to settle down. But another side is very fearful of it.' </p> <p>Could Georgina be the one? 'Well, she's a lovely girl. Eastern Europeans have a wonderful eccentricity. That's something that may happen. Or it may not. Let's put it like this - I would put money either way.' </p> <p>Winner's relationship with Ryan, Georgina's four-year-old son, sounds complicated. When Winner and Georgina go holidaying in 'posh hotels', Ryan visits Dinah's family in Cheshire. 'To have a whole family environment in the country, horses and dogs and the sea, it has been a wonderful thing for him, to bring him out.' </p> <p>It becomes obvious that the little boy is not a frequent visitor to Winner Towers, partly because Winner 'doesn't want to get too involved in case something goes wrong', and also because 'a four-year-old in this house, with all the antiques... it would send me into... he's a lovely kid'. </p> <p>Boys! One wonders how Georgina copes with the pair of them. </p> <p><strong>The world according to Winner</strong></p> <p><strong> On Margaret Thatcher</strong> 'She transformed this nation from a country that was ridiculed and despised abroad into one that was respected.' </p> <p><strong> On films generally</strong> 'Today's movies are more fun, quicker-witted, and all-over better than they ever were.' </p> <p><strong> On his film Death Wish </strong> ' Death Wish changed the whole context of cinema. It's the most copied film of all time, from Robocop to Rambo .' </p> <p><strong> On The Weakest Link </strong> 'Contestants willingly go forth to be humiliated by this strange, Dracula-like figure: a sarcastic headmistress dealing with idiot children.' </p> <p><strong> On going knickerless</strong> 'It's disgusting. It means that, frankly, you defecate on to your trousers.' </p> <p><strong> On actors</strong> 'Actors are very shy and insecure people who get their gratification by impersonating people who are not shy or insecure.' </p> <p><strong> On theft</strong> 'I stopped stealing when I was 17... Now, although I take towels, soap, cutlery from hotels, and airplanes, I ask permission first!' </p> <p><strong> On his school (St Christopher's, Letchworth)</strong> 'A Quaker, socialist, do-good, open-toed-sandals, Bernard Shaw-type school.'</p>",

'I remembered Georgina and called her, as one does if one is a lonely bachelor, which I have been for longer than almost anyone else on the planet. However pathetic you may be, you still try to make dates. It's that or watch the spin-dryer.' Ageing, he says, isn't fun. He is offended by his stomach in the mirror ('I think, \"How dare you look like that?\"') and would be lost without his three hair restoratives (he's very proud of his cloudy white coif, and says that one of his worst habits is combing it in restaurants). Every time a relationship ends, and he seems to be fairly passive in the break-ups, he feels less alluring. 'It becomes more frightening. I used to think I was always very ugly, but when I look at old photographs I see that I was actually very beautiful. And every year you're getting older and fatter. Yeah, I think I have reached a point now where I'd quite like to settle down. But another side is very fearful of it.' Could Georgina be the one? 'Well, she's a lovely girl. Eastern Europeans have a wonderful eccentricity. That's something that may happen. Or it may not. Let's put it like this - I would put money either way.' Winner's relationship with Ryan, Georgina's four-year-old son, sounds complicated. When Winner and Georgina go holidaying in 'posh hotels', Ryan visits Dinah's family in Cheshire. 'To have a whole family environment in the country, horses and dogs and the sea, it has been a wonderful thing for him, to bring him out.' It becomes obvious that the little boy is not a frequent visitor to Winner Towers, partly because Winner 'doesn't want to get too involved in case something goes wrong', and also because 'a four-year-old in this house, with all the antiques... it would send me into... he's a lovely kid'. Boys! One wonders how Georgina copes with the pair of them. The world according to Winner On Margaret Thatcher 'She transformed this nation from a country that was ridiculed and despised abroad into one that was respected.' On films generally 'Today's movies are more fun, quicker-witted, and all-over better than they ever were.' On his film Death Wish ' Death Wish changed the whole context of cinema. It's the most copied film of all time, from Robocop to Rambo .' On The Weakest Link 'Contestants willingly go forth to be humiliated by this strange, Dracula-like figure: a sarcastic headmistress dealing with idiot children.' On going knickerless 'It's disgusting. It means that, frankly, you defecate on to your trousers.' On actors 'Actors are very shy and insecure people who get their gratification by impersonating people who are not shy or insecure.' On theft 'I stopped stealing when I was 17... Now, although I take towels, soap, cutlery from hotels, and airplanes, I ask permission first!' On his school (St Christopher's, Letchworth) 'A Quaker, socialist, do-good, open-toed-sandals, Bernard Shaw-type school.'",

He said the club wanted to rededicate themselves to youth because transfer prices were becoming prohibitive, and he needed a coach to take charge.' Robbie Fowler, Steve McManaman, Michael Owen, Dominic Matteo and others are testimony to the success of the Liverpool youth scheme, and from a poky office at Melwood, Heighway has now graduated to running a state-of-the-art Academy in Kirkby, intended to produce Anfield stars for years to come. A far cry from the situation that confronted him on his return to England. 'Things have improved immeasurably since then. Maybe I was spoiled in America, but I can still remember the shock of coming back to Liverpool and discovering that a small club like Clearwater was better organised at youth level than most of the biggest professional clubs in England.'",

      "body": "<p>Football supporters will forgive talented players most indiscretions so long as they try. So long as they have pride in the shirt. For Arsenal fans and Charlie George this was a given. He was one of them; he had the skills, he had the swagger, he had the Arsenal tattooed on his heart, and he made that dreamlike, quantum leap off the terrace and on to the pitch. </p> <p>George was wonderfully unique. Although he wasn't the only elusive maverick floating through football in the early 1970s, he was the only one who played for the team he had loved ever since he could remember loving anything. In the summer of 1953, with England in the throes of street parties to honour the Queen's coronation, George the toddler went out to play dressed up as Jimmy Logie, the wizard who crafted Arsenal's attack of the day. Little did Mr and Mrs George realise that their boy would one day become the King of Highbury. </p> <p>A vintage shot from football's 1971 collection of gimmicky photographs depicts George in full regalia - shimmering robe over his kit, jewelled crown atop his lank hair, sceptre in one hand and FA Cup in the other. His expression is something to behold, a cross between, 'What the 'eck's this all about, I quite like being a king, as it goes', and 'This is a right laugh.' Nothing fazed him. 'I wasn't really a shy person,' he says, master of understatement. 'I never felt out of place. I've always mixed with people a bit older than myself and as a kid I always played with older people so I never felt inferior. Once you step over the line you get a buzz, you know? In a funny way it's a cockiness from knowing what I could do when I played football and I always had confidence in my own ability. There wasn't anything I didn't think I could do with a ball. That was my philosophy.' </p> <p>He breezed into the dressing room oozing the cheek of the Artful Dodger and the arrogance of Top Cat. Not only did he enter into the banter immediately, he started plenty. 'He was just Charlie off the terraces when he was walking about in an Arsenal blazer,' remembers Frank McLintock, the skipper of that 1971 Double-winning side. 'If he didn't like somebody he'd let them know, You're a tosspot and all that, and he never lost his brashness at all. He was a right outspoken sod, but that's what made him a special player.' </p> <p>His social impact was nothing compared to the shockwaves he caused at the training ground. Some of the experienced pros had never seen anything like him. His party piece was to launch the ball into orbit, eye it indifferently as it sped down, then kill it stone dead. A doddle. He had swank, he had subtlety of touch, he had substantial thighs, assets that fused to give him the power to unleash those trademark missile shots. George sprayed passes around with the ease of Beckenbauer, knocked volleys over his shoulder and into the roof of the net like Best, swerved past challenges like Cruyff... McLintock and McNab glanced at each other in amazement... and then he swore like a trooper. Good old Charlie, all the skill in the world and none of the sophistication. </p> <p>George's distinctive style made a statement: I don't care, I don't pose, I just let it all happen. Without even trying the rebel was perpetuating his own myth. But strip away the layers of bravado and way down in the pit of George's stomach was evidence of nerves. 'I used to be physically sick before games,' he admits. 'Frank said to me years ago, \"I know there's a lot of pressure on you because you're a local lad.\" I never actually felt it but I couldn't eat before a game because I used to burn a lot of acid up in my body. Once I was out there I was OK. I've never felt in awe of anybody, never ever in my life. There was nothing that any footballer could do that I never felt I could do. Whether that was right or wrong it's a good attitude to have.' </p> <p>His unwavering belief endeared him to his team-mates. If he was having an average game compared to the grandiose heights he could achieve, Bob Wilson used to get hold of him at half-time, urging him, coaxing him, pushing him to find the magic. 'He had an amazing ability, even if he'd played badly, to remember the one great ball he'd hit,' says Wilson. 'Charlie had the strut at 19.' </p> <p>Don Howe, who coached that Arsenal side, was full of praise for George. 'They talk today about these players dropping off - Zola, Cantona, Bergkamp - we were doing that 30 years ago with Charlie George,' he says. 'And he was superb. Yes, he scored great goals, but he was the crucial link between the back and the front as well.' As for Charlie, he couldn't care less where he played as long as he played. 'I could play either up front or midfield. It didn't matter, I always felt football was easy. If you gave me the ball I would do the work. I only wanted the ball, then I would do whatever you wanted me to do with it.'. </p> <p>The FA Cup was the perfect platform for Arsenal's virtuoso. The roulette wheel of knockout competition stimulated his creativity and stoked his con viction. Under the spotlight of the big occasion reputations are created or killed. With each round in 1971, so George's reputation grew. Having got back into the scoring groove in the fourth round against Portsmouth, he netted winners in the next two stages. And a couple of them were the kind of gems only George could unearth. </p> <p>Maine Road was not the most appetising draw for Arsenal, especially on a surface like a swimming pool. 'I don't know whether Malcolm Allison had flooded it at the time, I think they had a couple of players injured,' George recalls, 'but when it rains in Manchester... it rains.' The game was played under the floodlights on a ghastly night. McLintock felt it was time to play mind games with the joker in Arsenal's pack, just in case he wasn't feeling inspired. 'I hope you play well tonight, Charlie,' warned the captain. 'I was talking to Malcolm Allison and he doesn't rate you at all. He reckons you can only last about 30 minutes, he thinks you'll die a death - typical cockney.' </p> <p>Charlie turned the air in the dressing room blue, then promptly went out and upstaged City's stars Franny Lee, Colin Bell and Mike Summerbee, with a stellar performance that included two goals. McLintock, of course, hadn't spoken to City's coach before the game and he took great delight in telling Allison and George afterwards. </p> <p>The semi-final pitted Arsenal against Stoke, the team whose 5-0 demolition job had rocked the them in the league earlier in the season. Nightmare start. Two-nil down at half-time and on the way to another drubbing. What's more, both goals were gifts, one from Peter Storey and the other from George with a wayward backpass. It was an afternoon ruled by nerves and Arsenal were losing theirs. In the dressing room at half-time crockery was smashed, tempers soared, and Arsenal emerged refocused. Peter Storey demonstrated all his deft talent with a fierce, long-range drive to make it 2-1, then all his deadly nerve with an injury-time penalty. The Double dream remained alive. </p> <p>The replay was a one-sided affair. No nerves this time. And George soon got over Hillsborough clanger: 'The first touch I got was a 60-yard backpass to the goalkeeper. I was very conscious of what had happened in the previous game and I did it just to prove to myself that everything was going to be all right. You get over something. You made a mistake but you've got to get on with it, you're not going to change the course of history because whatever's happened happened. We won the game 2-0, quite comfortably in the end.' </p> <p>George always was something of an enigma. How else do you begin to explain his movements after the league title-winning night at White Hart Lane? The quintessential Arsenal man, born in Islington and bred on the North Bank, having just played in the most liberating derby any Gooner could ever witness... what did he do after their 1-0 win, when the team coach drew up at Southgate? He hopped on the Tube and went home. The lads hit the boozer, his old man and fianc\u00e9e were out looking for him to help their favourite boy paint the town red and white. And Charlie went home. He just felt like it, so he did. </p> <p>Enigmatic? I'll say. Little wonder moody pubescents all over London wished they could be like Charlie George. And frivolous nymphettes wished they could be with Charlie George. And bashful housewives wished they could mother Charlie George. And that's before even mentioning what Charlie meant to the Arsenal faithful. He was one of them, and he was living out all of their fantasies. </p> <p>In the midst of the madness in the visitors' dressing room at White Hart Lane God knows how anyone heard the telephone ring. 'Bill Shankly here, put that man Bertie Mee on the line,' commanded football's mastermind. 'A tremendous performance Bertie, magnificent. You may even give us a game on Saturday.' Mee, we can safely assume, was in the mood to take on anyone. And Charlie was in the mood to go home to his mum and dad's flat. Were you saving yourself for something Charlie? 'I don't know what for,' he says, with a teasing laugh. </p> <p>Shankly wasn't the only one to indulge in mental trickery. 'We got him back at the final,' Bob Wilson recalls. 'As we'd been at Wembley twice before, we knew that because of the drill with the Royal party they keep you waiting in the tunnel with the cameras on you for far too long. You can wet yourself there, some players really lose it. We refrained from going out. The FA official knocked on the door. \"Sorry, we're not ready,\" said Bertie. \"Just doing my team talk.\" The second knock and Frank made out he had a problem with a stud. The Liverpool lads were out there for ages and Shanks knew exactly what we were up to. We saw him fuming when we came out.' </p> <p>George, having vomited his jitters out in the dressing-room lavatory, was as imperious as ever. His first match at Wembley was beamed to 400 million around the world. 'I wasn't nervous. I just wanted to go and get started so we could get the game over, win the Cup and go and have a drink,' he says. </p> <p>Liverpool got their noses in front through Steve Heighway in extra time. Then play Brian Moore: 'Radford, back over his head. Kelly is right in there, playing much more as a striker in this extra time... AND IT'S THERE! GEORGE GRAHAM! It's George Gra ham who got the touch and makes it 1-1!' In fact it was George Graham who sold the greatest dummy of all time, kidding everyone in the stadium that he'd got the final touch. 'It didn't matter, we'd scored,' grins Charlie. 'Pushing forward and trying to score in extra time is very difficult. It was so hot, like a cauldron. The heat was so intense it was unbelievable. The day absolutely drains you. </p> <p>'The 90-minute period I've played as well as anyone, but in extra time I was tired. I swapped over and moved up front, I think Geordie [Armstrong] dropped back. I was a little bit knackered but I could always find the strength to hit one from 20-30 yards. It was never a problem. It was easy for me to hit a ball, no matter how far.' Brian Moore: 'Graham. Radford. Charlie George. Radford. Oh, Charlie George, who can hit 'em... OH WHAT A GREAT GOAL CHARLIE GEORGE! WELL WHAT A FABULOUS GOAL BY GEORGE! CLEMENCE HAD NO CHANCE WITH THAT!' </p> <p>It was stunning. And what followed was equally staggering: Charlie was floored by his own knockout blow. It remains one of the game's enduring images, imprinted on the minds of football fans regardless of club. There is Charlie, a symbol of everything that is precocious about football and life, lying flat out with his arms outstretched on the Wembley turf. The best thing about it is the look on his face. It's as if he's saying, 'Well what did you all expect? It just happened, didn't it?' </p> <p>Charlie is as casual about it as ever. 'I've been a supporter myself. I always feel you're giving them something back. If you score and just run back to the halfway line it's absolute bollocks. There's no feeling. I always felt the rapport with the crowd. I enjoyed it - if you don't there's no point in playing.' </p> <p>That night Charlie didn't slope off home - he went mad. Critics say George never fulfilled his true potential. He could have ended up playing for Barcelona. He ended up playing for Dundee United. He shrugs. 'I could have been a better player I suppose, people seem to have said that about me. I'm quite happy about my life, I don't complain about anything, just sort of get on with it.' </p> <p>So George drifted about, from one shenanigan to the next. One of his fingers is missing, which he claims is the result of a lawnmower accident. It's debatable whether even the lawnmower believes him. He always was a rogue. </p> <p>Now he's back where he started, a face going about his business in Islington, watching the Arsenal on Saturdays. Wherever he goes he's still patted on the back for that goal. If you had a pound for every time it's been mentioned to you, eh Charlie? 'People recognise you scored the goal which enabled the club to win the Double,' he says. 'No matter where I go now - I watch Arsenal approximately 80 per cent of games home and away - I'm recognised and I enjoy it. 'I've been a supporter and then I played and now I'm a supporter again. I only watch Arsenal.'</p>",

      "body": "<p>The theory is simple enough. At the start of the season, as every player will tell you and the manager has grown tired of stressing, Liverpool's priority was to qualify for a Champions League place. Becoming the first Anfield side to reach three cup finals in the same season was not on anyone's agenda, but that is how it has turned out. The club's priority remains the same, and the general consensus now is that Liverpool will take what comes in the FA and Uefa Cup finals but would be devastated to miss out on a top-three Premiership finish. Yet being blas\u00e9 about cup finals is easier said than done, as Michael Owen is not afraid to admit. </p> <p>'It's true the league has been the priority all along, and still is,' he said. 'But the closer you get to a cup final the more it takes precedence over anything else. Now these two finals are so close, we can't wait to play in them.' </p> <p>It should not be forgotten that Liverpool are not quite Manchester United yet. They no longer reach FA Cup finals every other year or thereabouts, and are not so familiar with the old tin pot as to treat it with contempt. Indeed, only Robbie Fowler and the injured Jamie Redknapp still survive from the side that lost to Manchester United in their last final appearance five years ago, so regarding one of English football's great occasions as a mere distraction is a tall order for the present Liverpool side. </p> <p>Especially its English contingent. Vladimir Smicer is happy enough to admit he only picked up on the significance of Cardiff on Saturday from the animation he observes in his team-mates. 'Back home in the Czech Republic, more people are impressed that we have reached the final of the Uefa Cup,' Smicer said. 'The FA Cup is not such a big thing there, and I didn't realise how big it is here at first, but I do now.' </p> <p>The significance of Cardiff is not lost on Owen and Fowler, who are anxious to bulk out medal collections which look anorexic in comparison to those of comparable Liverpool players of the recent past. 'Losing in 1996 was the worst feeling I've ever had as a professional footballer, and it has taken a long time to get to another FA Cup final to try to make amends,' Fowler said. 'I don't want to say which of the two remaining finals I'd rather win. Call me greedy, but I'd like to win both of them.' </p> <p>As captain Fowler would set some sort of record if he gets to lift all three trophies, whereas Owen, after sitting out the entire Worthington Cup final, would simply be glad of a game. One way or another, rotation always crops up in discussions with Liverpool strikers. There are three of them, four if you include Jari Litmanen and five if you count Nick Barmby, so someone always has to miss out. G\u00e9rard Houllier can give you chapter and verse on the realities of the modern, 14-man game - from substitutes winning the Champions League for Manchester United to French replacements tipping the balance in the Euro 2000 final against Italy, not forgetting his own match winners from the bench in the semi-final against Wycombe Wanderers - but no amount of statistics can make a professional player feel happy about missing out on a major final. </p> <p>'If you are a footballer you want to play,' Owen said. 'I'm no different, and it isn't easy when you're not selected, but we can understand the situation. I don't think many people could play 50 or 60 games in a season [the FA Cup final will be Liverpool's 61st game, with another two still to go], and we've been getting the results, so you can't argue.' </p> <p>Owen tends to be used sparingly by England these days too, but does not believe Liverpool's squad rotation is affecting his international chances. 'It's a fact of life at most big clubs now, it's not as if we're the only ones doing it,' he said. 'I don't think Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson expects every player to play in every game, in fact he's probably glad to see us get a bit of rest. If you look at Manchester United, they rotate Andy Cole and Teddy Sheringham all the time, but they both made the last England squad. I don't see it as a problem.' </p> <p>Owen also reports little in the way of problems from his previously troublesome hamstring this season and is as pleased with his fitness as his form. 'Footballers are always vulnerable when they are coming back from injury, trying to get back into the swing of things after a lay-off,' he said. 'That's the danger period, and obviously when you are out for a while, it knocks you back a bit. That's what has been happening to me, I've had a few ups and downs, and I just need to get back to a consistent level. When I've been 100 per cent fit all year I've played well. I might not be quite there yet, but I was pleased with my form the other day against Bradford - the more I play the stronger I feel.' </p> <p>Latest intelligence from Soho Square is that Eriksson thinks Owen may be the answer to England's longstanding problem on the left. The striker does not dismiss the suggestion out of hand. 'I think I've scored more goals with my left foot this season that ever before, certainly more than with my head or my right foot,' he said. 'So maybe it's worth a go, I can't say until I've tried it. I'm only 21, I don't think I'm the finished article yet. It's possible that given the chance I could become more of an all round player, I don't know.' </p> <p>Liverpool will be talking to Owen at the end of the season about an extension to his contract, which still has two years to run. 'There's no need to go into all that now, except to say I definitely want to carry on being a Liverpool player,' Owen said. That should be all right then. 'We are happy and proud to have Michael Owen at this club,' commented Houllier. 'We would definitely like to keep him.'</p>",

'Goodnight Mr Wenger,' said the agent. 'You just look after the boy Cole,' was Wenger's loaded reply.</p> <p>No young prodigy ever comes with a guarantee that he will make the grade, but those in the know were in no doubt Ashley Cole had all the credentials. That said, nobody expected his rise to be quite this meteoric: frequently chosen ahead of a Brazilian international for his club, an outstanding performer in the Champions League, in comfortable possession of his country's No3 shirt - all before he has even thought about moving out of his mum's house or upgrading his faithful Renault Clio. He won't even allow himself to admit he belongs in the first team yet. After all, Wenger only told him to move his gear into the senior dressing room at the start of the season. </p> <p>'I really didn't expect all this,' he says, the thrill still genuine as he contemplates his whirlwind arrival. 'Even training with these guys, let along playing with them, is a great experience for me. They have taken me in, told me I'm good enough to be here, they are encouraging me, and hopefully I'll stay here for a long time.' He wants to emulate the 13-year stranglehold one of his heroes, Nigel Winterburn, put on the left-back position at Arsenal. Before the veteran left for West Ham last summer, the pair used to watch each other: Cole studying Winterburn to try to pick up tips, and Winterburn observing Cole to give his heir apparent a boost and pointers to improve his game. </p> <p>The apprentice takes after the old master. Like Winterburn, he is as dependable and tenacious as a well-trained guard dog seeing off unwanted visitors. Who needs experience when you have talent and temperament? The 20-year-old Cole, who handled provocative taunting in Valencia, and a barrage of bottles and lipstick cases in Albania, seems blissfully immune to pressure. 'You can't let anything intimidate you or it will effect your game,' he says. 'You really can't get scared when you are a player. I've learned that you have to be strong, you can't let anything overawe you.' </p> <p>Cole's increasing aplomb is pretty bad luck for Silvinho, whose status as Winterburn's ideal replacement is eroding with every game his young rival at left back notches up. The friendly competition between the two is intriguing and while they currently have a mutual appreciation society, they won't happily share one spot in the team in the long term. During the course of the season Wenger's favour has noticeably shifted. Silvinho was undisputed first choice at the start, Cole has made three times as many starts since the New Year. Not once has he let his side down. 'Ashley does not need people saying, \"Do this\" or \"Go there\". He knows, he knows,' says Silvinho, admiringly. </p> <p>Defensively, the snappy and perceptive Cole has the edge and, although Silvinho is blessed with greater offensive trickery, Cole - whose promise as a prolific striker first drew Arsenal's attention - intends to emulate the best of the Brazilian left-backs. 'I like Roberto Carlos, the way he attacks, and I'd love to have a strike like him,' he drools. 'He's got natural talent, but I think if you train hard enough you can be nearly as good as that.' Music to Arsenal ears, as anyone who has seen their stray set pieces recently will testify. And England won't be discouraging him either. </p> <p>Liam Brady, Arsenal's head of youth development, believes there is a lot more to come: 'Ashley has self-belief but crucially, he believes in himself quietly. That is one of the vital ingredients for progress. He has no airs and graces and no ego. He's under Ars\u00e8ne's wing now and Ars\u00e8ne has a good track record of helping players to add to their game.' </p> <p>And what of those criticisms that his right foot is non-existent? 'Highly talented players don't need a right foot, they use the outside of the left foot very effectively instead. Have you ever seen Roberto Carlos or Maradona use their right foot? Ashley knows he has to work on his right foot but he's only 20 for God's sake.' </p> <p>Brady is protective of Cole, the symbol that the youth programme he set up five years ago is bearing fruit. Looking at improvements in that area by Manchester United, Liverpool and latterly Leeds, was crucial (before Cole, the last youngster to make a lasting impression at Highbury was Ray Parlour nine years ago). 'Ashley is an inspiration to the other boys,' adds Brady. 'We tell them he didn't have any guarantees, but he relished the challenge and now look where he is. In the Arsenal first team and in the England team. It's an incredible story.' </p> <p>Three years ago he was in the party of young pros taken to Wembley to watch the first team in the FA Cup final, remembering, 'All the reserves and youths went to watch, and we won. Good eh?' This time, the club have organised a train to take their youngsters to Cardiff and Cole will think of them when he's on the coach to the Millennium Stadium. He may now socialise with Thierry Henry and Sylvain Wiltord, but he still hangs out with the friends he left behind a year ago, young players striving to make an impression and follow in his eager footsteps. Says Cole: 'I try to help them out, go to the session with them and tell them how important it is to train well. That's what people used to tell me.' Ashley Cole, a mere slip of a lad, almost sounds like the old man of the Arsenal back four.</p>",

      "body": "<p>So that's it. Coventry City are down from the Premiership and we will be playing our football in the Nationwide next season. And I will be labelled as the manager who took them out of the top league for the first time since 1967. </p> <p>Disappointed, of course I am, but we have to live with that. And live with it we will. Not only that, I am determined to make our exile from the elite as short as possible. I have to say that defeat was hard to take at Aston Villa because we took the fight to them so well. In the end we just could not hold on to our lead. But boy, we tried. </p> <p>For obvious reasons, it is difficult for any club to face up to the possibility of going down. But there is no point in burying one's head in the sand and, to give Coventry the best chance of recovering from such a setback, our chairman Bryan Richardson and myself started preparing a relegation contingency plan almost six weeks ago. </p> <p>This is not the first time we have gone down this road. The other occasion was four seasons ago, when our Nationwide League blueprint was rendered unnecessary through that remarkable 2-1 win at Tottenham which enabled us to retain our Premiership place on the last day. Had we gone down then, I think that the extent to which we had prepared ourselves would have given us a good chance of quickly getting back. It is the same this time. </p> <p>The major problem for relegated clubs concerns the vast financial gap between the Premiership and Nationwide League. The headache of maintaining the contracts of your top players on a much lower income is particularly pronounced in the case of comparatively small clubs such as Coventry. It's Catch 22, in that while it is necessary to reduce one's wage bill, it is generally the highest-earners - and your most saleable playing assets - who can provide the key to getting you back into the top flight. </p> <p>In that respect, Bryan Richardson and I are agreed that even in the First Division, it will be essential for us to retain as many of our quality players as we can. I say 'even' because at one time, this level tended to be looked upon as a place where skill could not properly flourish. Under the old League set-up, it was often said that teams could not 'play' their way out of the Second Division - they had to claw their way out. I had personal experience of this during my short spell in the Second Division with Leeds under Howard Wilkinson. Though our Leeds team which won the Second Division Championship in 1990 had skilful players, the success stemmed mainly from our physical power, commitment and organisation. Basically, we looked upon our approach as a 'horses for courses' one. However, while the qualities we portrayed are still important, the recent rule changes in football have led to a greater onus on ball-playing skills at all levels. </p> <p>One only has to look at the two teams who have gained automatic promotion this season - Fulham and Blackburn - to appreciate the point. Both are excellent footballing teams who hardly look as if they will need extensive surgery in order to look the part in the Premiership. </p> <p>In view of all this, it should come as no surprise that the players we want to keep now include John Hartson and Craig Bellamy. As I have said, we would not have been in this position had we been able to sign John earlier. I cannot believe any team have experienced as many missed chances as we have. John, in addition to overcoming this problem, has also lifted the whole team through his overall play. </p> <p>After my recent article about John in these pages, my attention was drawn to a passage in Sir Alex Ferguson's autobiography in which Fergie recounts a disagreement involving his then assistant Brian Kidd over John. Apparently, Kidd had suggested to Manchester United's chairman Martin Edwards that the club should try to buy John from West Ham. But Ferguson did not think he had the ability to play for a club like that. In fact, Ferguson indicated that he was horrified by the suggestion. </p> <p>It is not for me to say what is right or wrong for Manchester United, but my view is that John Hartson has the overall ability to be able to adapt to any club and any type of football. Craig Bellamy, John's Welsh international col league, has benefited from his presence as much as anyone. The burden of being our most expensive signing has not been an easy one for Craig to carry, given that he is only 21 and had no previous Premiership experience.</p> <p>In addition to John's influence, Craig has also been helped by being switched to the left side of midfield, a position from which he can more easily get a run at defenders. These are just some of the factors which tell me that, amid the tears that will be shed in Coventry after our defeat against Villa, we do have cause to be positive about our future. </p> <p>In my view, the most crucial aspect of this is the willingness of everybody at this club to accept some responsibility for our plight and to help each other put things right. </p>",

      "bodyText": "So that's it. Coventry City are down from the Premiership and we will be playing our football in the Nationwide next season. And I will be labelled as the manager who took them out of the top league for the first time since 1967. Disappointed, of course I am, but we have to live with that. And live with it we will. Not only that, I am determined to make our exile from the elite as short as possible. I have to say that defeat was hard to take at Aston Villa because we took the fight to them so well. In the end we just could not hold on to our lead. But boy, we tried. For obvious reasons, it is difficult for any club to face up to the possibility of going down. But there is no point in burying one's head in the sand and, to give Coventry the best chance of recovering from such a setback, our chairman Bryan Richardson and myself started preparing a relegation contingency plan almost six weeks ago. This is not the first time we have gone down this road. The other occasion was four seasons ago, when our Nationwide League blueprint was rendered unnecessary through that remarkable 2-1 win at Tottenham which enabled us to retain our Premiership place on the last day. Had we gone down then, I think that the extent to which we had prepared ourselves would have given us a good chance of quickly getting back. It is the same this time. The major problem for relegated clubs concerns the vast financial gap between the Premiership and Nationwide League. The headache of maintaining the contracts of your top players on a much lower income is particularly pronounced in the case of comparatively small clubs such as Coventry. It's Catch 22, in that while it is necessary to reduce one's wage bill, it is generally the highest-earners - and your most saleable playing assets - who can provide the key to getting you back into the top flight. In that respect, Bryan Richardson and I are agreed that even in the First Division, it will be essential for us to retain as many of our quality players as we can. I say 'even' because at one time, this level tended to be looked upon as a place where skill could not properly flourish. Under the old League set-up, it was often said that teams could not 'play' their way out of the Second Division - they had to claw their way out. I had personal experience of this during my short spell in the Second Division with Leeds under Howard Wilkinson. Though our Leeds team which won the Second Division Championship in 1990 had skilful players, the success stemmed mainly from our physical power, commitment and organisation. Basically, we looked upon our approach as a 'horses for courses' one. However, while the qualities we portrayed are still important, the recent rule changes in football have led to a greater onus on ball-playing skills at all levels. One only has to look at the two teams who have gained automatic promotion this season - Fulham and Blackburn - to appreciate the point. Both are excellent footballing teams who hardly look as if they will need extensive surgery in order to look the part in the Premiership. In view of all this, it should come as no surprise that the players we want to keep now include John Hartson and Craig Bellamy. As I have said, we would not have been in this position had we been able to sign John earlier. I cannot believe any team have experienced as many missed chances as we have. John, in addition to overcoming this problem, has also lifted the whole team through his overall play. After my recent article about John in these pages, my attention was drawn to a passage in Sir Alex Ferguson's autobiography in which Fergie recounts a disagreement involving his then assistant Brian Kidd over John. Apparently, Kidd had suggested to Manchester United's chairman Martin Edwards that the club should try to buy John from West Ham. But Ferguson did not think he had the ability to play for a club like that. In fact, Ferguson indicated that he was horrified by the suggestion. It is not for me to say what is right or wrong for Manchester United, but my view is that John Hartson has the overall ability to be able to adapt to any club and any type of football. Craig Bellamy, John's Welsh international col league, has benefited from his presence as much as anyone. The burden of being our most expensive signing has not been an easy one for Craig to carry, given that he is only 21 and had no previous Premiership experience. In addition to John's influence, Craig has also been helped by being switched to the left side of midfield, a position from which he can more easily get a run at defenders. These are just some of the factors which tell me that, amid the tears that will be shed in Coventry after our defeat against Villa, we do have cause to be positive about our future. In my view, the most crucial aspect of this is the willingness of everybody at this club to accept some responsibility for our plight and to help each other put things right.",

      "body": "<p>David O'Leary was in surprisingly chipper mood after Wednesday's goalless draw with Valencia; possibly because it was his forty-third birthday, maybe because Leeds United had once again managed to live with supposedly superior opponents, but most likely because 90 minutes from a Champions League final with no goals conceded is not a bad place to be for a naive young manager with no previous experience. </p> <p>Real Madrid would swap places with Leeds for a start. Not to mention Manchester United and Arsenal. It is worth remembering too that when Manchester United won the thing two years ago, they travelled to Turin for the second leg of their semi-final with a 1-1 scoreline from the visit of Juventus to Old Trafford. The Italian team's superiority that night had been overwhelming, and Manchester United were grateful for the late Ryan Giggs goal, which gave them a semblance of parity and a glimmer of hope, but 1-1 was not a result that left anyone but Alex Ferguson looking forward to the second leg. </p> <p>'We deserved criticism after being thoroughly outplayed in the first half,' the United manager said. 'But it was a different game when we denied space to Zinedine Zidane, and I was genuinely optimistic about going to Turin.' </p> <p>Rightly, as it turned out, because although Juve scored twice in the first 15 minutes, United found the away goals rule counted heavily in their favour. Once Roy Keane pulled a goal back, Ferguson's team needed only one more to be in a winning position, and in the event scored two. The point is that 0-0 after the home leg is by no means a bad result, indeed some would argue it is the best result of all. </p> <p>Taking any sort of lead into the second leg always introduces the dilemma of whether to defend it or try to increase it, and invariably alters the way a team performs. Consider the difficulty Leeds experienced in defending a 3-0 advantage in the quarter-final against Deportivo. Leeds don't have to think too hard about how to approach their second leg, they just have to score at least as many goals as Valencia to go through. Home advantage must make the Spanish team favourites, but Valencia do not specialise in bunches of goals or swarming attacks like Barcelona, Real Madrid and even Deportivo, and any team capable of winning 4-1 in Anderlecht and scoring twice at the Bernabeu must fancy their chances of finding the net at some stage in the tie. </p> <p>'I know we are capable of scoring away goals, and if we get just one in the second leg it could make all the difference,' O'Leary said. 'I'm not trying to pretend I wouldn't prefer to be going there with a lead, but at the end of the day we are 90 minutes from the final and the tie isn't over. There is everything to play for, and it could still turn out to be a great night for us in Valencia.' </p> <p>Leeds can succeed, O'Leary feels, if they play the game and not the occasion. This is the Irishman's current buzz-phrase, old favourites like 'naive young manager' and 'we're just a bunch of nobodies' having been jettisoned for fear of being interpreted as false modesty, and because no one knows what it means. It does sound good though, whether it makes sense or not, and seems to sum up Leeds' admirable determination and distaste for reputations. </p> <p>As Brian Clough reminded us all on television only last week, the Leeds United who reached the European Cup final in 1975 had a distaste for reputations too. As Clough saw it, the side that Don Revie created and Jimmy Armfield inherited had a distasteful reputation, although it is grossly misleading to characterise Leeds as the only cynical team around at a time when everyone else was playing the beautiful game. There certainly was a ruthless edge to Revie's teams - they did not so much play the game or the occasion as the opponents and the ref eree - but every team featured hard men then and all Leeds were really guilty of was exploiting the laxity of the laws more successfully than anyone else. </p> <p>Nostalgia is permissible for those days when men were men, pitches were mudheaps and defenders had the referee's blessing to neutralise skill with ill-timed tackles from behind, but you would not watch it for long at today's prices. Fifa's rule changes and refereeing guidelines have quite rightly put the emphasis back on skill, pace and athleticism, and the best teams now are the ones who can cope with the technical demands of the modern game while retaining passion and if possible a combative edge. That is partly why Italian teams have struggled in the Champions League recently, while Spanish and English sides have been in the ascendancy. It is also why Leeds have emerged so strongly in the past couple of years, because O'Leary has managed to combine feistiness and flair more successfully than anyone else. </p> <p>Manchester United and Arsenal, the last two teams to win the Premiership, both did so with a mixture of aggression and ability, though both have experienced difficulty keeping the former quality under control. It is not just a matter of the disciplinary problems that have beset Keane and Patrick Vieira, more that those players appear to be working to different agendas to their team-mates, who are perceived to be coasting or not pulling their weight. Keane has just imperiled his Old Trafford popularity by going public on this very point, which illustrates how difficult it is for managers to keep an edge to their team without wanting to condone over-aggression. </p> <p>Whether by luck or good judgment (probably the latter since he made David Batty his first buy and instantly promoted Alan Smith) O'Leary has got this balancing act just right. At Elland Road everybody works, everybody fights, yet Leeds are not cynical or dirty and have some of the most skilful players in the league. A good match for Valencia, in other words. 'We work very hard on getting to know players, getting the best out of them,' O'Leary said. 'I only want workers here, I'm not into kissing mega-stars' rears. My kind of mega-star is one that plays for the team, like Gaizka Mendieta.' </p> <p>Hector Cuper was suitably impressed. 'We have just played a very ambitious team, but there will be more space for us in Valencia,' he said. 'I don't think Leeds will play such an attacking formation away from home.' Don't bank on it, Hector.</p>",

Rightly, as it turned out, because although Juve scored twice in the first 15 minutes, United found the away goals rule counted heavily in their favour. Once Roy Keane pulled a goal back, Ferguson's team needed only one more to be in a winning position, and in the event scored two. The point is that 0-0 after the home leg is by no means a bad result, indeed some would argue it is the best result of all. Taking any sort of lead into the second leg always introduces the dilemma of whether to defend it or try to increase it, and invariably alters the way a team performs. Consider the difficulty Leeds experienced in defending a 3-0 advantage in the quarter-final against Deportivo. Leeds don't have to think too hard about how to approach their second leg, they just have to score at least as many goals as Valencia to go through. Home advantage must make the Spanish team favourites, but Valencia do not specialise in bunches of goals or swarming attacks like Barcelona, Real Madrid and even Deportivo, and any team capable of winning 4-1 in Anderlecht and scoring twice at the Bernabeu must fancy their chances of finding the net at some stage in the tie. 'I know we are capable of scoring away goals, and if we get just one in the second leg it could make all the difference,' O'Leary said. 'I'm not trying to pretend I wouldn't prefer to be going there with a lead, but at the end of the day we are 90 minutes from the final and the tie isn't over. There is everything to play for, and it could still turn out to be a great night for us in Valencia.' Leeds can succeed, O'Leary feels, if they play the game and not the occasion. This is the Irishman's current buzz-phrase, old favourites like 'naive young manager' and 'we're just a bunch of nobodies' having been jettisoned for fear of being interpreted as false modesty, and because no one knows what it means. It does sound good though, whether it makes sense or not, and seems to sum up Leeds' admirable determination and distaste for reputations. As Brian Clough reminded us all on television only last week, the Leeds United who reached the European Cup final in 1975 had a distaste for reputations too. As Clough saw it, the side that Don Revie created and Jimmy Armfield inherited had a distasteful reputation, although it is grossly misleading to characterise Leeds as the only cynical team around at a time when everyone else was playing the beautiful game. There certainly was a ruthless edge to Revie's teams - they did not so much play the game or the occasion as the opponents and the ref eree - but every team featured hard men then and all Leeds were really guilty of was exploiting the laxity of the laws more successfully than anyone else. Nostalgia is permissible for those days when men were men, pitches were mudheaps and defenders had the referee's blessing to neutralise skill with ill-timed tackles from behind, but you would not watch it for long at today's prices. Fifa's rule changes and refereeing guidelines have quite rightly put the emphasis back on skill, pace and athleticism, and the best teams now are the ones who can cope with the technical demands of the modern game while retaining passion and if possible a combative edge. That is partly why Italian teams have struggled in the Champions League recently, while Spanish and English sides have been in the ascendancy. It is also why Leeds have emerged so strongly in the past couple of years, because O'Leary has managed to combine feistiness and flair more successfully than anyone else. Manchester United and Arsenal, the last two teams to win the Premiership, both did so with a mixture of aggression and ability, though both have experienced difficulty keeping the former quality under control. It is not just a matter of the disciplinary problems that have beset Keane and Patrick Vieira, more that those players appear to be working to different agendas to their team-mates, who are perceived to be coasting or not pulling their weight. Keane has just imperiled his Old Trafford popularity by going public on this very point, which illustrates how difficult it is for managers to keep an edge to their team without wanting to condone over-aggression. Whether by luck or good judgment (probably the latter since he made David Batty his first buy and instantly promoted Alan Smith) O'Leary has got this balancing act just right. At Elland Road everybody works, everybody fights, yet Leeds are not cynical or dirty and have some of the most skilful players in the league. A good match for Valencia, in other words. 'We work very hard on getting to know players, getting the best out of them,' O'Leary said. 'I only want workers here, I'm not into kissing mega-stars' rears. My kind of mega-star is one that plays for the team, like Gaizka Mendieta.' Hector Cuper was suitably impressed. 'We have just played a very ambitious team, but there will be more space for us in Valencia,' he said. 'I don't think Leeds will play such an attacking formation away from home.' Don't bank on it, Hector.",

The Foreign Office issued the ailing 71-year-old gangster with an emergency passport allowing him to make a single journey from Brazil to Britain. A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'He's still a wanted criminal and action will be taken as soon as he lands.' Biggs, who has suffered two strokes, told the police last week that he wanted to fly home and give himself up. A spokesman for Brazil's Federal Police said the plane, chartered by the Sun newspaper, was due to leave Rio International Airport at 4pm today. Foreign Secretary Robin Cook personally checked that there would be no delay in issuing the documentation to let Biggs return. A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'Clearly if someone is wanted for questioning here and wants to come back and hand themselves in, we would want to ensure there was no delay, and in the event there was none.' His return, whether to jail, hospital or freedom, will end a half a lifetime on the run for Biggs, who escaped from a London prison in 1965, two years after helping to pull off one of the most famous robberies in British history. He had served 15 months of a 30-year sentence for his part in the robbery of a Glasgow-to-London mail train. The raid netted more than \u00a32.6 million and became an instant legend. The robbers bludgeoned the train driver Jack Mills, who died six years later, possibly from the effects of his injuries. Biggs says he has none of the robbery money. He won the right to live in Brazil permanently after fathering a son, Michael, there 26 years ago. The Brazilian authorities repeatedly denied British requests for his extradition. Kevin Crace, a family friend, said Biggs was 'very excited' at the prospect of coming home. Crace had spoken to Michael who told him 'the old Biggs sparkle' had appeared in his father's eyes. The endgame began three weeks ago when Biggs had his telephone cut off. With his health failing and his finances low, he knew only desperate action would keep him alive. The Sun was happy to oblige: if Biggs returns to Britain to face the music, Michael, who is brokering the deal, will benefit by an estimated \u00a3100,000. After persuading Biggs to email a senior detective at the Yard with the news and pose for a series of photographs as he said 'goodbye' to Rio, the paper was ready to begin publishing its scoop.

      "body": "<p>If anyone can persuade Tony Blair that it is his Government's duty to save Wembley Stadium for the nation - public responsibility of the old Socialist kind - it might, ironically, be Adam Crozier, a modern, young Blairite with practised spinning skills. </p> <p>In a bunker-like conference room at the Football Association's headquarters on Friday afternoon, the FA's smooth chief executive looked anything but the isolated object of ridicule some commentators had painted him as recently. He wore a forgettably ordinary suit, his crisp, white shirt knotted by an elegant blue tie, as his eyes settled on a clutch of inquisitors from the Sunday papers. Crozier has been a whipping boy for the tabloids since the FA announced they were pulling out of the interminable Wembley fiasco, and he was hitting back, in the nicest possible way. </p> <p>He was going to set the record straight, to 'move forward', as he said repeatedly in marketspeak, and perhaps a few details 'might be helpful'. </p> <p>These were selling tricks he'd refined at Saatchi's where, in the power vacuum created by the departure of Charles and Maurice, he was sucked to the top ahead of his time from the relative calm of middle-management. Once installed as joint chief executive, he 'restructured'. But, as a former colleague of Crozier's said yesterday: 'He did it quietly. His talent is people management, client handling. He's intelligent, very low-key, quietly spoken. And he's slick, manipulative, and political. Probably centre-left.' </p> <p>Sounds like the Prime Minister. Almost. </p> <p>Crozier is one of those people who doesn't have to know everything about his subject to convince you to buy it. He gets in other people for the detail. (When we asked him how long the FA Cup might be held in Cardiff, he said they had options for 'three or four years'; it was left to his press aide Paul Newman to remind him it was actually five years.) </p> <p>What Crozier is selling Blair, then, is a partnership between the FA and the Government to turn Wembley into an Olympic-class stadium, primarily used for football but adaptable enough to house other events and 'less well-off sports', as he put it. He thinks they'll buy it. If they don't, Crozier goes back in the public stocks. </p> <p>'The truth is that every one needs to hold their hands up and say that they made mistakes,' he confided, 'right back to the decisions that were made five or six years ago. This isn't about what's happened in the last few months. This is a result of decisions taken over a long period of time.' </p> <p>Such moderate rhetoric, such admirable spreading of collective responsibility, comes across as a welcome contrast to the megaphone style of Ken Bates, who stormed away from his disastrous stewardship of the Wembley project, spitting incomprehensible insults in all directions. However, the fact that Crozier has been lobbying - unsuccessfully, it seems - to have Bates removed from the FA's governing board should tell you that, below the calm waters, there is still some fierce paddling going on. </p> <p>When Crozier arrived at Soho Square, he strongly disagreed with the Bates plan for Wembley. Bates wanted a grandiose, hotel-driven complex, football-only, very much in the image of his Chelsea Village, and he convinced the Culture Secretary, Chris Smith, to drop the platform option that would have been needed for a concealed athletics track. Unfortunately he also succeeded in frightening off the City, who smelled dissent and doubt. </p> <p>He had no luck in making Kate Hoey toe his line, however, and last week produced one of his least funny soundbites, recommending the Sports Minister should be shot, an unfortunate if unwitting observation only hours after her father had died. </p> <p>Now, though, young Adam has to get his hands dirty. He has to convince Blair to raid the exchequer if Wembley is not to be ground into the dust. He will play the history card and the Olympic option. </p> <p>He pointed out that the saga started in 1995 when the FA took over Wembley from the English National Stadium Trust, telling the Conservative Government they could deliver the football but no money. 'And that was agreed between the Government and the FA,' he says. </p> <p>That much you can't argue with. Also, for all the talk about 'the billions washing about in football', the FA are not the Premier League. Crozier says the Government appreciate the distinction. The FA make their money selling the FA Cup and the England team. Their wider remit is to look after football, from the grassroots to the top; whether or not they have always done that properly is not central to this argument, but Crozier is entitled to point out that this is their overriding responsibility. </p> <p>Crozier says the old understanding between the FA and the Government persisted until last November. There had been confusion over how to fix Wembley, he conceded, but people were going roughly in the same direction. Then, it went badly wrong in a hurry. </p> <p>Crozier is probably right when he says the Dome factor didn't help. There were problems with the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, too. There was a general perception that 'things were out of control'. The banks got jittery. If the FA had gone ahead with the project alone, he said, they risked going bankrupt. The professional response was to stop and think again. </p> <p>'It became clear that, effectively, what the banks in the City were saying was, \"We want someone absolutely on the hook for the money, we want someone to take the risk,\" because as we all know, frankly, banks don't take risks; they like other people to take the risks. And what they said was they wanted full financial recourse to the FA. In other words, they wanted the FA to stump up all of the money and pay all of the interest. At that point, as many of you know, we made a number of changes to the leadership of the project.' Exit Bates. Loudly. </p> <p>The FA worked it out it would cost them \u00a3125 million in equity, plus \u00a355m a year to make the current Wembley plan work. They couldn't do it, Crozier says. So the salesman went to work on New Labour's conscience. What they could afford, with a partner, was \u00a3100m up front, and \u00a320m a year for three years. </p> <p>'We know from Brent Council that there are something like 15,000 jobs, either directly or indirectly, related to the building of the stadium, and the whole regeneration of the Wembley area either succeeds or it doesn't on the basis of this stadium.' </p> <p>That takes care of the socialism, then. </p> <p>'Secondly, the one thing that the Olympic stadiums in Italy and Germany, the national stadium in France, the Olympic stadium in Sydney, the new one that's been announced in Ireland, and frankly any national stadium in any country in the world, the one thing they have in common is they're all built by governments, not by private organisations.' And they lose money. Sydney is soon to go into insolvency. This was starting to sound distinctly Soviet. </p> <p>According to the Crozier blueprint, the Government could buy in to Wembley, stay for a few years, sell up and get out with a profit. Whether Blair will go for it or not should be decided when the Government's task force and the FA meet on Tuesday. The FA reckon there is a good chance the Government will opt for an Olympic-class stadium and bid for the 2012 Games. They want the Government - or Sport England, if the Lottery rules can be adjusted - to buy up the 44 acres next to the stadium and turn the whole complex into something special. </p> <p>The last piece in Crozier's plan is very Old Labour. He says the Government should be prepared to do what governments in France and Australia do: take a bath on a national stadium. If this Scottish charmer can persuade his clone in 10 Downing Street to lose millions to save Wembley after the disaster of the Dome, he might qualify as salesman of the year. </p> <p>And his old Saatchi colleague says: 'He could sell it to Blair, no problem.'</p>",

Such moderate rhetoric, such admirable spreading of collective responsibility, comes across as a welcome contrast to the megaphone style of Ken Bates, who stormed away from his disastrous stewardship of the Wembley project, spitting incomprehensible insults in all directions. However, the fact that Crozier has been lobbying - unsuccessfully, it seems - to have Bates removed from the FA's governing board should tell you that, below the calm waters, there is still some fierce paddling going on. When Crozier arrived at Soho Square, he strongly disagreed with the Bates plan for Wembley. Bates wanted a grandiose, hotel-driven complex, football-only, very much in the image of his Chelsea Village, and he convinced the Culture Secretary, Chris Smith, to drop the platform option that would have been needed for a concealed athletics track. Unfortunately he also succeeded in frightening off the City, who smelled dissent and doubt. He had no luck in making Kate Hoey toe his line, however, and last week produced one of his least funny soundbites, recommending the Sports Minister should be shot, an unfortunate if unwitting observation only hours after her father had died. Now, though, young Adam has to get his hands dirty. He has to convince Blair to raid the exchequer if Wembley is not to be ground into the dust. He will play the history card and the Olympic option. He pointed out that the saga started in 1995 when the FA took over Wembley from the English National Stadium Trust, telling the Conservative Government they could deliver the football but no money. 'And that was agreed between the Government and the FA,' he says. That much you can't argue with. Also, for all the talk about 'the billions washing about in football', the FA are not the Premier League. Crozier says the Government appreciate the distinction. The FA make their money selling the FA Cup and the England team. Their wider remit is to look after football, from the grassroots to the top; whether or not they have always done that properly is not central to this argument, but Crozier is entitled to point out that this is their overriding responsibility. Crozier says the old understanding between the FA and the Government persisted until last November. There had been confusion over how to fix Wembley, he conceded, but people were going roughly in the same direction. Then, it went badly wrong in a hurry. Crozier is probably right when he says the Dome factor didn't help. There were problems with the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, too. There was a general perception that 'things were out of control'. The banks got jittery. If the FA had gone ahead with the project alone, he said, they risked going bankrupt. The professional response was to stop and think again. 'It became clear that, effectively, what the banks in the City were saying was, \"We want someone absolutely on the hook for the money, we want someone to take the risk,\" because as we all know, frankly, banks don't take risks; they like other people to take the risks. And what they said was they wanted full financial recourse to the FA. In other words, they wanted the FA to stump up all of the money and pay all of the interest. At that point, as many of you know, we made a number of changes to the leadership of the project.' Exit Bates. Loudly. The FA worked it out it would cost them \u00a3125 million in equity, plus \u00a355m a year to make the current Wembley plan work. They couldn't do it, Crozier says. So the salesman went to work on New Labour's conscience. What they could afford, with a partner, was \u00a3100m up front, and \u00a320m a year for three years. 'We know from Brent Council that there are something like 15,000 jobs, either directly or indirectly, related to the building of the stadium, and the whole regeneration of the Wembley area either succeeds or it doesn't on the basis of this stadium.' That takes care of the socialism, then. 'Secondly, the one thing that the Olympic stadiums in Italy and Germany, the national stadium in France, the Olympic stadium in Sydney, the new one that's been announced in Ireland, and frankly any national stadium in any country in the world, the one thing they have in common is they're all built by governments, not by private organisations.' And they lose money. Sydney is soon to go into insolvency. This was starting to sound distinctly Soviet. According to the Crozier blueprint, the Government could buy in to Wembley, stay for a few years, sell up and get out with a profit. Whether Blair will go for it or not should be decided when the Government's task force and the FA meet on Tuesday. The FA reckon there is a good chance the Government will opt for an Olympic-class stadium and bid for the 2012 Games. They want the Government - or Sport England, if the Lottery rules can be adjusted - to buy up the 44 acres next to the stadium and turn the whole complex into something special. The last piece in Crozier's plan is very Old Labour. He says the Government should be prepared to do what governments in France and Australia do: take a bath on a national stadium. If this Scottish charmer can persuade his clone in 10 Downing Street to lose millions to save Wembley after the disaster of the Dome, he might qualify as salesman of the year. And his old Saatchi colleague says: 'He could sell it to Blair, no problem.'",

But it was a fractious game too: both teams ended it with 10 men, with first Rangers captain Barry Ferguson and then Hearts defender Steven Pressley being shown red cards. </p> <p>Hearts, who needed to take at least a point to keep fourth-placed Kilmarnock in their sights, made three changes to the side who drew 1-1 at Kilmarnock. Out went Grant Murray, Lee Makel and Andy Webster, with Kevin McKenna, Thomas Flogel and Robert Tomaschek replacing them. </p> <p>Rangers made a single change in the wake of their 3-0 home defeat by Celtic last Sunday, with Billy Dodds replaced by Claudio Reyna. </p> <p>The home side started strongly and Rangers goalkeeper Stefan Klos was called into action when McKenna tried his luck from long range. The German had to scramble low to his right post to prevent the ball creeping in. </p> <p>Rangers' reply almost brought the first goal when Arthur Numan crossed from the left to the onrushing Fernando Ricksen and it needed a good stop by goalkeeper Antti Niemi to thwart him. </p> <p>Niemi is the current Scottish Premier League player of the month and he showed why in the 21st minute. Tore Andre Flo manoeuvred his way into a shooting position and his effort took a bad bounce off the scarred turf and hit the Finn straight in the face. The ball rebounded to Rod Wallace in front of goal yet somehow Niemi was able to make a point-blank save from the striker's instinctive shot. </p> <p>Rangers did make the breakthrough, though, in the 29th minute when Jorg Albertz's firmly struck free-kick went in off the far post. </p> <p>But just two minutes later, Dick Advocaat's side were down to 10 men, when Barry Ferguson went in hard and late on Pressley. Referee Hugh Dallas showed the Rangers captain a straight red card. </p> <p>Ferguson's dismissal revived memories of the previous Tynecastle game, in which Rangers won 1-0 but finished with nine men. </p> <p>Despite being a man down, though, Rangers finished the half on top and in the 37th minute Albertz hit the far post from a free-kick again but this time the ball rebounded back to Niemi instead of going in the net. </p> <p>Hearts made two changes after the break with Cameron and Steven Boyack being replaced by Lee Makel and Juanjo. And it was the Spaniard who set up Hearts' equaliser in the 47th minute with a cross from the right that Klos misjudged. He could only push the ball out to Adam, who deflected the ball in from close range. </p> <p>Parity did not last, however, and Rangers regained the lead after Albertz touched a free-kick to Lorenzo Amaruso, whose drive was too strong for Niemi to hang on to. Wallace duly converted the rebound. </p> <p>The next moment of drama was not far away. Pressley was sent off for his second bookable offence in a matter of minutes, this time chopping down Albertz as the German motored towards goal. </p> <p>Hearts began to throw men forward in search of an equaliser but were caught twice by swift counter-attacks. The first came in the 79th minute when Konterman's clearance from his own penalty area reached Flo, and he sent Albertz through to hammer the ball past Niemi. </p> <p>Six minutes later the German repaid the compliment with a long ball that put Flo through to poke the ball past the exposed Niemi.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Rangers fi their place in the Champions League qualifiers with an ultimately comfortable victory which further hampered Hearts' pursuit of a Uefa Cup place. But it was a fractious game too: both teams ended it with 10 men, with first Rangers captain Barry Ferguson and then Hearts defender Steven Pressley being shown red cards. Hearts, who needed to take at least a point to keep fourth-placed Kilmarnock in their sights, made three changes to the side who drew 1-1 at Kilmarnock. Out went Grant Murray, Lee Makel and Andy Webster, with Kevin McKenna, Thomas Flogel and Robert Tomaschek replacing them. Rangers made a single change in the wake of their 3-0 home defeat by Celtic last Sunday, with Billy Dodds replaced by Claudio Reyna. The home side started strongly and Rangers goalkeeper Stefan Klos was called into action when McKenna tried his luck from long range. The German had to scramble low to his right post to prevent the ball creeping in. Rangers' reply almost brought the first goal when Arthur Numan crossed from the left to the onrushing Fernando Ricksen and it needed a good stop by goalkeeper Antti Niemi to thwart him. Niemi is the current Scottish Premier League player of the month and he showed why in the 21st minute. Tore Andre Flo manoeuvred his way into a shooting position and his effort took a bad bounce off the scarred turf and hit the Finn straight in the face. The ball rebounded to Rod Wallace in front of goal yet somehow Niemi was able to make a point-blank save from the striker's instinctive shot. Rangers did make the breakthrough, though, in the 29th minute when Jorg Albertz's firmly struck free-kick went in off the far post. But just two minutes later, Dick Advocaat's side were down to 10 men, when Barry Ferguson went in hard and late on Pressley. Referee Hugh Dallas showed the Rangers captain a straight red card. Ferguson's dismissal revived memories of the previous Tynecastle game, in which Rangers won 1-0 but finished with nine men. Despite being a man down, though, Rangers finished the half on top and in the 37th minute Albertz hit the far post from a free-kick again but this time the ball rebounded back to Niemi instead of going in the net. Hearts made two changes after the break with Cameron and Steven Boyack being replaced by Lee Makel and Juanjo. And it was the Spaniard who set up Hearts' equaliser in the 47th minute with a cross from the right that Klos misjudged. He could only push the ball out to Adam, who deflected the ball in from close range. Parity did not last, however, and Rangers regained the lead after Albertz touched a free-kick to Lorenzo Amaruso, whose drive was too strong for Niemi to hang on to. Wallace duly converted the rebound. The next moment of drama was not far away. Pressley was sent off for his second bookable offence in a matter of minutes, this time chopping down Albertz as the German motored towards goal. Hearts began to throw men forward in search of an equaliser but were caught twice by swift counter-attacks. The first came in the 79th minute when Konterman's clearance from his own penalty area reached Flo, and he sent Albertz through to hammer the ball past Niemi. Six minutes later the German repaid the compliment with a long ball that put Flo through to poke the ball past the exposed Niemi.",

Rowling, I fear that association by celebrity may give some conditions a disproportionate share of sympathy and charity. My husband has recently been diagnosed with age-related macular degeneration - the major cause of blindness/low vision in the Western world. There is no treatment (except in rare situations) and no cure. Vision can be lost almost immediately or over a period of years. Early symptoms can be slight but ultimately catastrophic (a barely noticeable distortion of vision if present only in one eye, or a small black spot in the visual field).</p> <p>A minority of people can have their sight saved or the onset of the disease postponed by laser treatment. In practise this is almost impossible within the NHS where it can take three months to get a first appointment with an ophthalmologist. <br><b>Sandra Semple </b><br>London WC1</p> <p><b> Mind the facts </b><br></p> <p>\u0095 Ben Summerskill and Edward Helmore (News, last week) are right to point out that some UK papers are 'happy to set the hare running on stories promoting a Family Values agenda' and to cite as alarmist the Daily Mail's story headlined 'How daycare can make a toddler grow up unruly'. Unfortunately, though, the caption to the illustration repeats one of the Daily Mail 's most parent-scaring mistakes.</p> <p>Whatever the findings concerning the development of children cared for in nurseries in the cited study, they cannot be generalised to children cared for by childminders because this is an American study and registered childminding, the most-used form of out-of-home care for British under-fives, does not exist in the United States. <br><b>Penelope Leach </b><br>London NW3</p> <p><b> Pasta dish </b><br></p> <p>Could Cristina Odone (Comment, last week) pop over to Rome and tutor my Italian girlfriend on the 'ancient code of the mediterranea'.

Can I have some sugo on my pasta please, Cristina?<br><b>David Pickering </b><br>Roma, Italy</p> <p><b> Cane and enable </b><br></p> <p>\u0095 Blair's New Labour world is truly a world standing on its head. Rather than bribe the bribable to procreate with a \u00a3500 bounty, would it not be better to create a safe society with soul into which decent people actually want to bring up children? Rather than resort to the immoral and futile attempt to bribe the young away from early yobbism with a CD and a pair of trainers, would it not be better to reintroduce the cane for youngsters who misbehave? Churchill offered blood, sweat and tears for victory - not spin, deception and bribery.</p> <p>How low can politics sink? Bedroom sleaze sells little more than newspapers - Blair's New Labour sleaze is selling the soul of the nation. Can this really be the best man to win the next general election?<br><b>Richard Franklin </b><br>Brighton</p> <p><b> It's not working </b><br></p> <p>\u0095 Andrew Rawnsley (Comment, last week) is surely taking a spin too far in suggesting that this Government has already achieved full employment.</p> <p>From the end of the Second World War to the mix-Sixties, we had, with brief exceptions, unemployment rates of 2 per cent or less, and the threat of half a million unemployment would require urgent corrective action. In contrast, we now have a million people unemployed and claiming benefit, with several hundred thousand others unemployed under the broader Labour Force Survey criteria. <br><b>Colin Crouch </b><br>Harrow Weald, Middlesex</p> <p><b> French games </b><br></p> <p>\u0095 When Stuart Jeffries states that historically the French have enjoyed participating in sports more than their British neighbours, he is totally wrong (World, last week). The reverse is true.</p> <p>The French for most of the twentieth century considered sport to be a waste of time. Our French professor told us after the war: 'Vous aimez jouer avec un ballon mais nous les Francais nous aimons jouer avec les idees.' Thus the French have become the most technologically advanced country in Europe. Their rate of productivity is 40 per cent better than ours.</p> <p>In the Seventies French schools made a determined effort to introduce PE and games into the schools by making them compulsory. However, this measure was met with a deluge of 'excuse' notes from pupils' parents. Many of the stars of French sport are from recent immigrant communities - North African and West African. <br><b>Alban W. Mason </b><br>Colwyn Bay, N. Wales</p> <p><b> African tragedy </b><br></p> <p>\u0095 Philip Hensher, in his review of Dennis Altman's 'Global Sex', states that 'the prevalence of heterosexual Aids in sub-Saharan Africa has been widely attributed to the resort to sodomy as a firm of birth control'.</p> <p>The transmission and widespread prevalence of HIV in Africa is now, and always has been, inextricably linked with socio-economic, cultural and epidemiological factors predisposing to the rapid spread of HIV. Not least, these include widespread migratory working practices, large movements of refugees following national unrest, enhanced trade routes, and the pre-exis tence of numerous other sexually transmitted diseases. To target a single sexual practice as the main instigator of HIV in Africa is both factually untrue and a denial of the broader issues fanning the flames of this pandemic. <br><b>Ian Hodgson </b><br>University of Bradford</p> <p><b> American bullies </b><br></p> <p>\u0095 Thank goodness for Nick Cohen and for Lindis Percy! But when will any of our politicians have the backbone to stand up for British and European interests against this latest manifestation of US imperialism?</p> <p>I had hoped that 'Son of Star Wars' would be a step too far but no. It seems that, whoever is in the White House, our governments, regardless of party, will kowtow to them, even when it means violating international treaties, jeopardising our security, and isolating us from the concerns of our nearest neighbours and partners in Europe. <br><b>M.M. Gilchrist</b><br>Cupar, Fife</p> <p><b> Caborn's folly </b><br></p> <p>\u0095 Am I the only reader unpersuaded by [Trade Minister] Richard Caborn's attempt to refute Gregory Palast's attack on Gats (Business, last week)? There has been far too much information emerging concerning the potentially disastrous effects of free-trade negotiations on public services. Mr Caborn is either disingenuous or misinformed; I don't know which is more dangerous. <br><b>Ellie Weld </b><br>Twickenham, Mddx</p> <p><b> Gray's sin </b><br></p> <p>\u0095 I have no difficulty with Muriel Gray not liking religions (Review, last week); no doubt she has honed her analysis on the whetstone of her Glaswegian upbringing. Unfortunately, Ms Gray wears her dislike of religions, and Catholicism in particular, on her rather grubby sleeve. Far be it from me to suggest that Ms Gray is nothing more than an old-fashioned, Saturday night Glaswegian bigot masquerading as a fiction writer, but her offensive approach to the subject can only lead reasonable people to assume that Ms Gray's mouth has developed far ahead of her intellect.<br><b>Michael Conroy </b><br>High Wycombe, Bucks</p> <p><b> Ingrams late </b><br></p> <p>\u0095 It is clear Richard Ingrams is not a mobile phone user or he would know that his 'prediction' that mobile phone manufacturers would adopt a policy of 'built-in obsolescence' is itself obsolete (Diary, last week).</p> <p>Not only has there been the endless introduction of new operating systems, from analogue to digital to WAP with more to come, but the phones themselves seem to be regarded as disposable.

A minority of people can have their sight saved or the onset of the disease postponed by laser treatment. In practise this is almost impossible within the NHS where it can take three months to get a first appointment with an ophthalmologist. Sandra Semple London WC1 Mind the facts \u0095 Ben Summerskill and Edward Helmore (News, last week) are right to point out that some UK papers are 'happy to set the hare running on stories promoting a Family Values agenda' and to cite as alarmist the Daily Mail's story headlined 'How daycare can make a toddler grow up unruly'. Unfortunately, though, the caption to the illustration repeats one of the Daily Mail 's most parent-scaring mistakes. Whatever the findings concerning the development of children cared for in nurseries in the cited study, they cannot be generalised to children cared for by childminders because this is an American study and registered childminding, the most-used form of out-of-home care for British under-fives, does not exist in the United States. Penelope Leach London NW3 Pasta dish Could Cristina Odone (Comment, last week) pop over to Rome and tutor my Italian girlfriend on the 'ancient code of the mediterranea'. She laughs at my white legs rather than my jokes, and while she may quite possibly be indulging in an affair, the nearest she comes to domesticity is when she asks me to pay our cleaner. Can I have some sugo on my pasta please, Cristina? David Pickering Roma, Italy Cane and enable \u0095 Blair's New Labour world is truly a world standing on its head. Rather than bribe the bribable to procreate with a \u00a3500 bounty, would it not be better to create a safe society with soul into which decent people actually want to bring up children? Rather than resort to the immoral and futile attempt to bribe the young away from early yobbism with a CD and a pair of trainers, would it not be better to reintroduce the cane for youngsters who misbehave? Churchill offered blood, sweat and tears for victory - not spin, deception and bribery. How low can politics sink? Bedroom sleaze sells little more than newspapers - Blair's New Labour sleaze is selling the soul of the nation. Can this really be the best man to win the next general election? Richard Franklin Brighton It's not working \u0095 Andrew Rawnsley (Comment, last week) is surely taking a spin too far in suggesting that this Government has already achieved full employment. From the end of the Second World War to the mix-Sixties, we had, with brief exceptions, unemployment rates of 2 per cent or less, and the threat of half a million unemployment would require urgent corrective action. In contrast, we now have a million people unemployed and claiming benefit, with several hundred thousand others unemployed under the broader Labour Force Survey criteria. Colin Crouch Harrow Weald, Middlesex French games \u0095 When Stuart Jeffries states that historically the French have enjoyed participating in sports more than their British neighbours, he is totally wrong (World, last week). The reverse is true. The French for most of the twentieth century considered sport to be a waste of time. Our French professor told us after the war: 'Vous aimez jouer avec un ballon mais nous les Francais nous aimons jouer avec les idees.' Thus the French have become the most technologically advanced country in Europe. Their rate of productivity is 40 per cent better than ours. In the Seventies French schools made a determined effort to introduce PE and games into the schools by making them compulsory. However, this measure was met with a deluge of 'excuse' notes from pupils' parents. Many of the stars of French sport are from recent immigrant communities - North African and West African. Alban W. Mason Colwyn Bay, N. Wales African tragedy \u0095 Philip Hensher, in his review of Dennis Altman's 'Global Sex', states that 'the prevalence of heterosexual Aids in sub-Saharan Africa has been widely attributed to the resort to sodomy as a firm of birth control'. The transmission and widespread prevalence of HIV in Africa is now, and always has been, inextricably linked with socio-economic, cultural and epidemiological factors predisposing to the rapid spread of HIV. Not least, these include widespread migratory working practices, large movements of refugees following national unrest, enhanced trade routes, and the pre-exis tence of numerous other sexually transmitted diseases. To target a single sexual practice as the main instigator of HIV in Africa is both factually untrue and a denial of the broader issues fanning the flames of this pandemic. Ian Hodgson University of Bradford American bullies \u0095 Thank goodness for Nick Cohen and for Lindis Percy! But when will any of our politicians have the backbone to stand up for British and European interests against this latest manifestation of US imperialism? I had hoped that 'Son of Star Wars' would be a step too far but no. It seems that, whoever is in the White House, our governments, regardless of party, will kowtow to them, even when it means violating international treaties, jeopardising our security, and isolating us from the concerns of our nearest neighbours and partners in Europe. M.M. Gilchrist Cupar, Fife Caborn's folly \u0095 Am I the only reader unpersuaded by [Trade Minister] Richard Caborn's attempt to refute Gregory Palast's attack on Gats (Business, last week)? There has been far too much information emerging concerning the potentially disastrous effects of free-trade negotiations on public services. Mr Caborn is either disingenuous or misinformed; I don't know which is more dangerous. Ellie Weld Twickenham, Mddx Gray's sin \u0095 I have no difficulty with Muriel Gray not liking religions (Review, last week); no doubt she has honed her analysis on the whetstone of her Glaswegian upbringing. Unfortunately, Ms Gray wears her dislike of religions, and Catholicism in particular, on her rather grubby sleeve. Far be it from me to suggest that Ms Gray is nothing more than an old-fashioned, Saturday night Glaswegian bigot masquerading as a fiction writer, but her offensive approach to the subject can only lead reasonable people to assume that Ms Gray's mouth has developed far ahead of her intellect. Michael Conroy High Wycombe, Bucks Ingrams late \u0095 It is clear Richard Ingrams is not a mobile phone user or he would know that his 'prediction' that mobile phone manufacturers would adopt a policy of 'built-in obsolescence' is itself obsolete (Diary, last week). Not only has there been the endless introduction of new operating systems, from analogue to digital to WAP with more to come, but the phones themselves seem to be regarded as disposable. I have a Motorola less than three years old. The phone works fine, but the battery no longer recharges. A new battery would cost me \u00a349.99, less than a new phone. Stephen Butcher Ballymena, Co.

Pulses beginning to race, nerves tautening: personally, I haven't felt this excited since the day they introduced triangular teabags with little drawstring thingies - or maybe it was that day I read a bit of a book about concrete. Tony is only four thousand squillion percentage points ahead in every poll, including the one that showed Hague would win more votes if he were to change his name to William Teabag, and change his body and head to that of a teabag. (Mind you, we shouldn't sneer: dear Gorbals Mick - Mr Speaker Martin to you - is coming in for increasing amounts of stick for his attitude to the esteemed leader of the Opposition. I suppose his last Hague putdown - 'If my dog had a face like that I'd shave its arse and teach it to walk backwards' - wasn't exactly Churchillian.) Anyway, quiet rejoicing at it all being so obviously in the bag. In four short years, I keep being told, we have vanquished Conservatism. <p> <b>Tuesday:</b> Four short years. Four short, happy little inspiring years. I look around me, wanting to savour a snapshot of the day, to save a memory of what we are, what we have achieved. </p> <p>Tony has just congratulated the police for having bravely tackled a crowd of people with dodgy armpits, protected by little more than full body armour, batons, riot shields, dogs, horses, tactical control vehicles, the Government, the law, big business and a few more hundred thousand armed police up the side streets behind them. The Daily Mail has praised Tony; we did much better then the German police, apparently, so that's something to be proud of: for let's face it, those guys used to really know how to control a crowd! </p> <p>Rupert Murdoch has been in to visit Gordon and left, beaming, happy that we won't start taxing anyone or joining the euro or being left wing or anything. </p> <p>Tony has, with only the mildest prompting from Alastair, just congratulated George Bush on reversing the global peace process of the past 25 years and making China even more terrified and therefore dangerous than it was before. I think they made a Chinese 'election' joke on the telephone. </p> <p> <b>Wednesday:</b> And Jack Straw and Ann Widdecombe are arguing about who has been most successfully nasty to asylum-seekers. </p> <p>And our dear chum Geoffrey Robinson has been caught pocket-stuffing (again). </p> <p>And the Tube isn't working properly because we won't give it any money because we don't have any that's not earmarked for bribing the nation; the trains ditto, Wembley ditto. But Tony has a new pair of specs, and we saved Phoenix the calf. </p> <p>Vanquished. Utterly vanquished. </p> <p> <b>Thursday:</b> Tony and Co poring over today's articles summing up Ken's first year in power. He has, it seems, achieved nothing at all, made no difference: a few glossy brochures, a lot of spin and a half-remembered row over a pigeon or something. Looks of grudging admiration all round at this singular triumph. They might have him back in the party. </p> <p> <b>Friday:</b> Finally, we seem to have stopped killing things, and polls show that the countryside doesn't really hate us after all, or at least not as much as they still hate Hague for not being Thatcher or something, so that's all right then I suppose, and we can look forward to a big happy march on London from them some time soon, in which the Metropolitan Police, sponsored by the Daily Mail , will herd them into a street for seven hours and beat them up. And then there's the election too! Joy.</p>",

(Mind you, we shouldn't sneer: dear Gorbals Mick - Mr Speaker Martin to you - is coming in for increasing amounts of stick for his attitude to the esteemed leader of the Opposition. I suppose his last Hague putdown - 'If my dog had a face like that I'd shave its arse and teach it to walk backwards' - wasn't exactly Churchillian.) Anyway, quiet rejoicing at it all being so obviously in the bag. In four short years, I keep being told, we have vanquished Conservatism. Tuesday: Four short years. Four short, happy little inspiring years. I look around me, wanting to savour a snapshot of the day, to save a memory of what we are, what we have achieved. Tony has just congratulated the police for having bravely tackled a crowd of people with dodgy armpits, protected by little more than full body armour, batons, riot shields, dogs, horses, tactical control vehicles, the Government, the law, big business and a few more hundred thousand armed police up the side streets behind them. The Daily Mail has praised Tony; we did much better then the German police, apparently, so that's something to be proud of: for let's face it, those guys used to really know how to control a crowd! Rupert Murdoch has been in to visit Gordon and left, beaming, happy that we won't start taxing anyone or joining the euro or being left wing or anything. Tony has, with only the mildest prompting from Alastair, just congratulated George Bush on reversing the global peace process of the past 25 years and making China even more terrified and therefore dangerous than it was before. I think they made a Chinese 'election' joke on the telephone. Wednesday: And Jack Straw and Ann Widdecombe are arguing about who has been most successfully nasty to asylum-seekers. And our dear chum Geoffrey Robinson has been caught pocket-stuffing (again). And the Tube isn't working properly because we won't give it any money because we don't have any that's not earmarked for bribing the nation; the trains ditto, Wembley ditto. But Tony has a new pair of specs, and we saved Phoenix the calf. Vanquished. Utterly vanquished. Thursday: Tony and Co poring over today's articles summing up Ken's first year in power. He has, it seems, achieved nothing at all, made no difference: a few glossy brochures, a lot of spin and a half-remembered row over a pigeon or something. Looks of grudging admiration all round at this singular triumph. They might have him back in the party. Friday: Finally, we seem to have stopped killing things, and polls show that the countryside doesn't really hate us after all, or at least not as much as they still hate Hague for not being Thatcher or something, so that's all right then I suppose, and we can look forward to a big happy march on London from them some time soon, in which the Metropolitan Police, sponsored by the Daily Mail , will herd them into a street for seven hours and beat them up. And then there's the election too! Joy.",

Kevin Joyce has been 'missing presumed dead' since April 1981 - the United Nations' only missing-in-action 'blue beret'. The Inisheer-born private was kidnapped from his UN observation post in south Lebanon by a Palestinian faction a year before the Israelis invaded the region. Until now, those behind the abduction and suspected murder of the soldier, who was 19 at the time, have refused to admit responsibility. However, a spokesman for the Irish Defence Forces has confirmed that talks are under way aimed at finding Joyce's remains. The Irish battalion of Unifil has only seven months left to find the missing soldier's remains - the unit finally pulls out of Lebanon in November. 'Negotiations are still going on,' he said. 'There has been contact with a number of groups. The Irish battalion are dealing with this.' The battalion is working with the Maronite Bishop of Tyre and the Lebanese Minister for Missing and Displaced Persons, Senator Mirwan Hamadi. It is understood that Palestinians from refugee camps in south Lebanon have agreed to discuss the whereabouts of Joyce's remains - the first time anyone has admitted knowledge about the missing soldier. John Laffery, president of the army's union, PDFORRA, travelled to south Lebanon with Joyce's family last week to oversee the investigation into his disappearance. 'This is a festering sore for the Defence Forces,' he said. 'Every soldier that has served in Lebanon over the past 21 years owes to Kevin Joyce that we do everything to find him.

      "body": "<p>The last announcement of Tony Blair's Government will be pregnant with significance. It will not be about education or health or the economy, but about the one problem which has been a constant and nagging thorn in the side of the party: crime.</p> <p>After months of work by John Halliday, one of the Home Office's brightest civil servants, Home Secretary Jack Straw will finally announce the outcome of the Government's sentencing review on Tuesday. It will be peppered with New Labour language of rights and responsibilities, tougher sentences, reparations paid by the criminal to affected communities or individuals, harsher penalties for the 'persistent 100,000', the group that the Government says accounts for nearly half of all crime. Its language will be uncompromising.</p> <p>Three days ago Blair wrote an article about being tough on asylum seekers for the Times. On the first Sunday of the general election campaign, he will speak about Labour being the party for 'aspirational Britain'. He is planning a speech on patriotism and British identity. With three days to go before the election is called, a pattern is emerging: Labour fears that the campaign will be hijacked by subjects that are not its natural territory. It fears a fight on the Right.</p> <p>If Labour has learnt one lesson from its wilderness years, it is this: if your opponents decide to fight on an agenda that you are not comfortable with, the worse thing you can do is ignore it.</p> <p>Blair, advised by his chief pollster Philip Gould, has said that wherever Tories go during the campaign, he will not be afraid to follow them. There are no taboo subjects.</p> <p>Today is Blair's 48th birthday. He will spend the morning at Chequers before travelling to London in the evening. Tomorrow, a 'political cabinet' has been called at No 10 to discuss the manifesto. Blair will announce that a million copies of a shorter magazine will also be sent to wavering Labour voters setting out the Government's record. Election fever will grow.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Straw will make his announcement on crime. Blair then has a 24-hour window in which he will call the election, either later on Tuesday or on Wednesday.</p> <p>Five weeks ago, when Blair decided to delay the election because of foot and mouth, he faced an uncertain time. Labour critics thought the disease could derail the Government, that it would spiral out of control and the hiatus would allow time for tales of economic gloom to start dominating the headlines. That such thoughts could dominate - with the party so far ahead in the polls that Ladbrokes' odds are now 40 to one on for a Blair victory - reveals one essential truth about those inside the Government bunker: they suffer from chronic twitchiness.</p> <p>But then came the Tory leadership implosion, followed closely by the Tory race implosion and Blair's circle breathed a sigh of relief. 'We were fortunate,' admitted one key aide. 'We thought it might be a damaging time but actually the Tories made all the political weather for all the wrong reasons for them and the right reasons for us. I think we are actually going into the campaign stronger than we would have been a month ago.'</p> <p>Downing Street used the five-week delay to try to shore up areas where the public remains suspicious about the Government's record. It feeds the drift rightwards. First Blair made a speech on tackling yob culture, saying that petty criminals would be made to clear up their own graffiti. Then came announcements on health, modernising hospitals and improving care for expectant mothers. He finally confirmed the go-ahead for the baby bond for new parents.</p> <p>Then, last week, came the Times article on asylum, saying there should be faster removal of those who abuse the system and that the burden of taking asylum-seekers should be shared more equally across Europe. The subject is likely to come up again and again during the election, with the Tories constantly trying to increase the heat. They have mapped out 13 days during the campaign when Europe will be pushed as their main issue. The other days will concentrate on law and order and asylum. Blair has asked Roger Liddle, his foreign affairs adviser in Downing Street, to draft a speech for him saying something 'grand' on patriotism and Britishness and anchoring New Labour as comfortable with the Union Jack. David Miliband, head of the No 10 policy unit, will argue that Britain needs to rediscover its confidence. Blair plans to make the speech in the middle of the campaign.</p> <p>Blair has told officials that he wants to try to engage some of the enthusiasm that swept him to power. He has taken over writing the first chapter of the manifesto, to inject it with his desire to push for an 'aspirational Britain', to show that he is still the man to look after the interests of Middle Britain. It will be the key theme of his first speech of the campaign next Sunday. An appearance on Breakfast with Frost has been pencilled in and it will be the first push towards 7 June, election day.</p> <p>Party strategists know the centre ground is where elections are won and lost and that the right-wing agenda is often the popular agenda. The concern is that Labour has mislaid 'the vision thing'. In Downing Street they are worried. Some of the messages are getting confused.</p> <p>With only 10 days to go before the manifesto is published, there are still bracketed sections where the final wording has not been agreed. In health, where a decision has been taken to dump the waiting list pledge, they are still crunching numbers to see what type of promise they can come up with. Labour is trying to pull the campaign agenda onto its territory of public services and the economy. It knows it will be a struggle and has targeted the BBC to get movement. 'You know when you are getting close to an election, the letters start arriving,' said a BBC executive.</p> <p>The Tories know their only hope is in keeping the debate as narrowly focused as possible. By banging on the Euro-drum, on asylum, on crime, Hague hopes to drown out the rattling sabres in his own party. His fear is that, during the campaign, leadership rumours will start flourishing.</p> <p>A small example popped up on Thursday. Michael Portillo's press spokesman bumped into the Mirror journalist Paul Gilfeather who asked him what was happening. Malcolm Gooderham tartly retorted that the only thing a Labour-supporting paper like the Mirror would write about was the men hired to follow Hague around in silly masks.</p> <p>Gooderham insists it was a sarcastic comment. He awoke to accusations that he had stabbed Hague in the back by bringing the leader's humiliation to the paper's notice.</p> <p>In the feverish atmosphere surrounding Hague with talk of leadership battles and rifts, it only takes such trivialities to start trouble. Privately, senior figures will do their damnedest to distance themselves from Hague if it appears he is hurtling towards an even larger defeat than that of four years ago. Labour polling reveals that people who didn't vote Labour last time because they felt the party couldn't be trusted could turn out for Blair this time.

      "bodyText": "The last announcement of Tony Blair's Government will be pregnant with significance. It will not be about education or health or the economy, but about the one problem which has been a constant and nagging thorn in the side of the party: crime. After months of work by John Halliday, one of the Home Office's brightest civil servants, Home Secretary Jack Straw will finally announce the outcome of the Government's sentencing review on Tuesday. It will be peppered with New Labour language of rights and responsibilities, tougher sentences, reparations paid by the criminal to affected communities or individuals, harsher penalties for the 'persistent 100,000', the group that the Government says accounts for nearly half of all crime. Its language will be uncompromising. Three days ago Blair wrote an article about being tough on asylum seekers for the Times. On the first Sunday of the general election campaign, he will speak about Labour being the party for 'aspirational Britain'. He is planning a speech on patriotism and British identity. With three days to go before the election is called, a pattern is emerging: Labour fears that the campaign will be hijacked by subjects that are not its natural territory. It fears a fight on the Right. If Labour has learnt one lesson from its wilderness years, it is this: if your opponents decide to fight on an agenda that you are not comfortable with, the worse thing you can do is ignore it. Blair, advised by his chief pollster Philip Gould, has said that wherever Tories go during the campaign, he will not be afraid to follow them. There are no taboo subjects. Today is Blair's 48th birthday. He will spend the morning at Chequers before travelling to London in the evening. Tomorrow, a 'political cabinet' has been called at No 10 to discuss the manifesto. Blair will announce that a million copies of a shorter magazine will also be sent to wavering Labour voters setting out the Government's record. Election fever will grow. On Tuesday, Straw will make his announcement on crime. Blair then has a 24-hour window in which he will call the election, either later on Tuesday or on Wednesday. Five weeks ago, when Blair decided to delay the election because of foot and mouth, he faced an uncertain time. Labour critics thought the disease could derail the Government, that it would spiral out of control and the hiatus would allow time for tales of economic gloom to start dominating the headlines. That such thoughts could dominate - with the party so far ahead in the polls that Ladbrokes' odds are now 40 to one on for a Blair victory - reveals one essential truth about those inside the Government bunker: they suffer from chronic twitchiness. But then came the Tory leadership implosion, followed closely by the Tory race implosion and Blair's circle breathed a sigh of relief. 'We were fortunate,' admitted one key aide. 'We thought it might be a damaging time but actually the Tories made all the political weather for all the wrong reasons for them and the right reasons for us. I think we are actually going into the campaign stronger than we would have been a month ago.' Downing Street used the five-week delay to try to shore up areas where the public remains suspicious about the Government's record. It feeds the drift rightwards. First Blair made a speech on tackling yob culture, saying that petty criminals would be made to clear up their own graffiti. Then came announcements on health, modernising hospitals and improving care for expectant mothers. He finally confirmed the go-ahead for the baby bond for new parents. Then, last week, came the Times article on asylum, saying there should be faster removal of those who abuse the system and that the burden of taking asylum-seekers should be shared more equally across Europe. The subject is likely to come up again and again during the election, with the Tories constantly trying to increase the heat. They have mapped out 13 days during the campaign when Europe will be pushed as their main issue. The other days will concentrate on law and order and asylum. Blair has asked Roger Liddle, his foreign affairs adviser in Downing Street, to draft a speech for him saying something 'grand' on patriotism and Britishness and anchoring New Labour as comfortable with the Union Jack. David Miliband, head of the No 10 policy unit, will argue that Britain needs to rediscover its confidence. Blair plans to make the speech in the middle of the campaign. Blair has told officials that he wants to try to engage some of the enthusiasm that swept him to power. He has taken over writing the first chapter of the manifesto, to inject it with his desire to push for an 'aspirational Britain', to show that he is still the man to look after the interests of Middle Britain. It will be the key theme of his first speech of the campaign next Sunday. An appearance on Breakfast with Frost has been pencilled in and it will be the first push towards 7 June, election day. Party strategists know the centre ground is where elections are won and lost and that the right-wing agenda is often the popular agenda. The concern is that Labour has mislaid 'the vision thing'. In Downing Street they are worried. Some of the messages are getting confused. With only 10 days to go before the manifesto is published, there are still bracketed sections where the final wording has not been agreed. In health, where a decision has been taken to dump the waiting list pledge, they are still crunching numbers to see what type of promise they can come up with. Labour is trying to pull the campaign agenda onto its territory of public services and the economy. It knows it will be a struggle and has targeted the BBC to get movement. 'You know when you are getting close to an election, the letters start arriving,' said a BBC executive. The Tories know their only hope is in keeping the debate as narrowly focused as possible. By banging on the Euro-drum, on asylum, on crime, Hague hopes to drown out the rattling sabres in his own party. His fear is that, during the campaign, leadership rumours will start flourishing. A small example popped up on Thursday. Michael Portillo's press spokesman bumped into the Mirror journalist Paul Gilfeather who asked him what was happening. Malcolm Gooderham tartly retorted that the only thing a Labour-supporting paper like the Mirror would write about was the men hired to follow Hague around in silly masks. Gooderham insists it was a sarcastic comment. He awoke to accusations that he had stabbed Hague in the back by bringing the leader's humiliation to the paper's notice. In the feverish atmosphere surrounding Hague with talk of leadership battles and rifts, it only takes such trivialities to start trouble. Privately, senior figures will do their damnedest to distance themselves from Hague if it appears he is hurtling towards an even larger defeat than that of four years ago. Labour polling reveals that people who didn't vote Labour last time because they felt the party couldn't be trusted could turn out for Blair this time. Labour is trying to silence any talk of a bigger landslide, but many at Millbank believe it will happen. 'We are fighting this election as if it is on a knife-edge,' Campbell insisted yesterday. Skirmishes on the Right will begin today, with Shadow Foreign Secretary Francis Maude deployed to administer a stiletto between Robin Cook's ribs over the Foreign Secretary's crowning as president of the Party of European Socialists in Berlin tomorrow. Maude believes he can make hay from a document signed by three Labour MEPs condemning the US for being 'drunk with power' and calling for EU states to strengthen integration. The next day Hague will attack 'rotten boroughs', aimed at embarrassing Labour and the Liberal Democrats with tales of their local councillors embezzling cash, refusing to fly the Union Jack and condemning the national anthem as 'imperialistic'. The Tory manifesto was finished three days ago, Hague's wife Ffion has booked time off work to accompany him for every day of his tour, and his chief of staff Seb Coe has ensured his leader's gym schedule brings him to the peak of fitness. Ed Young, another Portillo aide, will manage Hague's battlebus in an overt demonstration of the two men working in tandem, while Portillo and Maude have been jointly entrusted with managing policy announcements. The unswervingly loyal Michael Ancram and Andrew Lansley will run the 'war room' at Smith Square. Hague wants to fight on the Right: crime, asylum, Europe. Labour fears that the dreaded ' Daily Mail agenda' will drown out their message and they will have to fight on the Right's territory. Hence Blair's article on asylum and the action on crime. Blair has a few hours at Chequers left before returning to London. Then the battle starts.",

When she graduates in two years, she will be among the few students to be relatively debt-free.</p> <p>The trend is clear. Taking your clothes off is going mainstream. When For Yours Eyes Only wanted dancers at its newest club in London's Mayfair, it placed advertisements in Cosmopolitan and Elle. Hundreds of women phoned in to inquire about auditions. Among them were bankers, nurses, students and estate agents.</p> <p>'It is not frowned upon anymore,' said Glenn Nicie, operations director at For Your Eyes Only. 'It is seen as more of a career move and a chance to make some very good money.'</p> <p>The company currently runs four clubs in London, one in Bournemouth and one in Southampton, but has plans for more in Newcastle, Manchester and Cardiff. At the same time Peter Stringfellow, the doyen of Britain's table-dancing scene, plans to expand from his London club in'to Manchester, Birmingham and Leeds.</p> <p>'The girls see themselves like athletes or professional footballers,' Stringfellow said. 'They can't do this for ever, but can make a lot of money while their careers last.' He employs 120 dancers at his club, where competition for jobs is fierce, with only about one in 20 applications successful.</p> <p>The boom in venues and the huge profits to be reaped have even attracted American lap-dancing supremo John Gray, who set up his first Spearmint Rhino club at the age of 18. Gray now owns Rhino clubs in Birmingham and London and expects to pull in \u00a3180,000 a week from each of his British venues.</p> <p>Cashing in on the boom is one former British stripper, Jo King, 42, who has just set up the London School of Striptease. She currently conducts one-to-one lessons, but is hoping to rent a studio 'within months' to hold proper group workshops. 'Eventually a proper academy of my own would be my dream,' she said.</p> <p>Women are attracted by the huge amounts of money that can be made: top table dancers can earn up to \u00a31,000 a night. They also work flexible hours and act as freelance agents. For many, it offers a chance to generate savings that more conventional careers never will.</p> <p>Michelle Smith, 31, has table-danced at Stringfellows for the last three years. Now she plans to use the cash she made to go back to her native Australia and set up her own business renovating and sell ing old houses. 'It has been a really good career for me. We are not being exploited, it is our own decision to do this,' she said.</p> <p>But there are dangers. While some clubs and chains consider themselves part of the entertainment industry, there are other operators firmly within the sex trade which fulfil the stereotypes of the past.</p> <p>Some clubs can cross over the line into exploitation and prostitution. 'There are bad apples out there who can undo all the work we are doing and try to drag the industry back into the gutter,' Nicie said.</p> <p>But for King, whose stripping career spanned almost two decades, the industry going mainstream is a long-awaited goal. As well as professionals, she says, many of her clients come to her to please a partner or as a self-confidence exercise. The popular image of strippers from Hollywood movies such as Striptease, starring Demi Moore as a struggling single mother, no longer paint a true picture.</p> <p>'I would love a film that shows a lawyer becoming a stripper because she can earn a lot more money. Wouldn't that be refreshing?'</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:paul.harris@observer.co.uk\">paul.harris@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

Her mother and sister watched her perform. 'At first they were a bit shocked when I gave up my \"respectable\" career, but now that they see the reality of the industry, they are very supportive,' she said. Now Ellery-Doe is using her wages to help pay for a degree course in photography at Bournemouth University. When she graduates in two years, she will be among the few students to be relatively debt-free. The trend is clear. Taking your clothes off is going mainstream. When For Yours Eyes Only wanted dancers at its newest club in London's Mayfair, it placed advertisements in Cosmopolitan and Elle. Hundreds of women phoned in to inquire about auditions. Among them were bankers, nurses, students and estate agents. 'It is not frowned upon anymore,' said Glenn Nicie, operations director at For Your Eyes Only. 'It is seen as more of a career move and a chance to make some very good money.' The company currently runs four clubs in London, one in Bournemouth and one in Southampton, but has plans for more in Newcastle, Manchester and Cardiff. At the same time Peter Stringfellow, the doyen of Britain's table-dancing scene, plans to expand from his London club in'to Manchester, Birmingham and Leeds. 'The girls see themselves like athletes or professional footballers,' Stringfellow said. 'They can't do this for ever, but can make a lot of money while their careers last.' He employs 120 dancers at his club, where competition for jobs is fierce, with only about one in 20 applications successful. The boom in venues and the huge profits to be reaped have even attracted American lap-dancing supremo John Gray, who set up his first Spearmint Rhino club at the age of 18. Gray now owns Rhino clubs in Birmingham and London and expects to pull in \u00a3180,000 a week from each of his British venues. Cashing in on the boom is one former British stripper, Jo King, 42, who has just set up the London School of Striptease. She currently conducts one-to-one lessons, but is hoping to rent a studio 'within months' to hold proper group workshops. 'Eventually a proper academy of my own would be my dream,' she said. Women are attracted by the huge amounts of money that can be made: top table dancers can earn up to \u00a31,000 a night. They also work flexible hours and act as freelance agents. For many, it offers a chance to generate savings that more conventional careers never will. Michelle Smith, 31, has table-danced at Stringfellows for the last three years. Now she plans to use the cash she made to go back to her native Australia and set up her own business renovating and sell ing old houses. 'It has been a really good career for me. We are not being exploited, it is our own decision to do this,' she said. But there are dangers. While some clubs and chains consider themselves part of the entertainment industry, there are other operators firmly within the sex trade which fulfil the stereotypes of the past. Some clubs can cross over the line into exploitation and prostitution. 'There are bad apples out there who can undo all the work we are doing and try to drag the industry back into the gutter,' Nicie said. But for King, whose stripping career spanned almost two decades, the industry going mainstream is a long-awaited goal. As well as professionals, she says, many of her clients come to her to please a partner or as a self-confidence exercise. The popular image of strippers from Hollywood movies such as Striptease, starring Demi Moore as a struggling single mother, no longer paint a true picture. 'I would love a film that shows a lawyer becoming a stripper because she can earn a lot more money. Wouldn't that be refreshing?' paul.harris@observer.co.uk",

      "bodyText": "Two female British backpackers were attacked by wild dingoes three days after a nine-year-old boy was mauled to death by dingoes at the same Australian resort, it emerged yesterday. Queensland state Prime Minister Peter Beattie said both women were bitten and scratched when attacked by a male dingo at a campsite on Fraser Island on Thursday. Schoolboy Clinton Gage was mauled to death and his seven-year-old brother was bitten extensively by at least two dogs near the remote Waddy Point campsite on the island off Queensland last Monday. The dogs believed to have been responsible for that attack were killed the same day, while the animals involved in the attack on the British tourists were put down yesterday as part of an island-wide cull of at least 28 dingoes. The attack on the British women has strengthened the government's resolve to continue with the cull despite criticisms from Aboriginal leaders. 'This last attack confirms, as far as I'm concerned, the need for the cull that we went through,' Beattie said. 'Children are more important than dingoes and I will not pull back from the culling, nor will my government.' One of the tourists, identified only as Katherine, was bitten on the legs and buttocks after she fell while the dingo was chasing her. She said it happened so fast she didn't even see the dingo lunge at her. 'I don't know where it came from,' she said. Although the cull was due to end by last night, a government spokeswoman said state rangers would continue to target dogs which came into townships and campsites on the island and were considered dangerous to locals and tourists. The state earlier rejected pleas from Aborigines and conservationists to halt killing of the dingoes. Aboriginal elder John Dalungadalee Jones and environmentalist Lyndon Schneiders, who went to court to try to halt the cull, expressed disappointment at the verdict. The Ngulungbara people refer to the wild dogs as brothers in nature and fellow hunters. 'This is our brother, the dingo,' said Jones. 'How would you feel if 30 of your brothers were knocked off? It's a tragic event a child losing its life, but I do not believe it required this level of response.' The authorities said they were now looking at long-term management of the risk, including plans to stop tourists feeding the dingoes by imposing fines of up to A$1,500 (\u00a3540). The world heritage-listed Fraser Island, which is about 160 miles north of Brisbane, is home to about 160 dingoes. They are considered the purest type of dingo in Australia and a protected species. Each year they are joined on the island by about 300,000 tourists, who are often blamed for feeding the dogs and encouraging human contact.",

      "bodyText": "Vital evidence not heard during one of the most notorious child murder cases in recent years could prove that the man convicted of the crime is innocent and the true killers are still at large, according to a fresh investigation. Nine-year-old Zoe Evans disappeared from her home in Warminster, Wiltshire, in the early hours of 11 January 1997 after being tucked up for the night by her mother, Paula. Despite launching Britain's biggest search for a missing person, it took police six and a half weeks to find Zoe's body, in a badger sett less than half a mile from her home. The post-mortem found that the child had died from asphyxiation - her T-shirt was pushed into her mouth to stop her screaming. Miles Evans, Zoe's stepfather, who was 27 at the time of the disappearance, was arrested five days after her disappearance when his bloodied T-shirt was found close to the burial scene. Two weeks later, the former soldier was charged with murder. Evans has always protested his innocence and, although the Court of Appeal announced last week that it would consider his case, he has continued to insist on a full retrial to clear his name. According to new evidence to be revealed this week, a retrial may prove that Evans could not have murdered Zoe. The investigation points to two other possible suspects whose names were withheld from the original trial because of lack of evidence. It will attempt to prove that Zoe's body was only placed in the badger sett a few days before it was discovered by police; if successful, it could clear Evans's name. 'The prosecution claimed the six-week delay was because the body was originally fully buried and was only later pulled out by animals,' said Steve McDonnell, editor of the Meridian Television Focus programme, to be screened this week. But five weeks before the body was discovered, a team of Metropolitan Police officers with dogs trained to search for bodies was told not to look in the area around the badger sett, because it had already been searched. 'Evans's movements from the morning after Zoe's disappearance were fully accounted for,' added Ashton. 'So, if the body was put there after that point, he could not have been responsible for the murder.' The investigation also found that two youths seen roaming around Warminster on the night of Zoe's disappearance, who were later accused of raping a young woman that same night, could have been near Zoe's home at the time she disappeared. One, identified as Youth A, had a conviction for indecent assault. When questioned by police shortly after the murder, he denied knowing Zoe but later changed his evidence, conceding that he was familiar with the child because she was a schoolfriend of his sister. The new investigation has also uncovered two witnesses who did not appear in the original trial. They say they saw two men, one bearing a close similarity to Youth A, disposing of a full bin liner in bushes the morning after Zoe's disappearance.

'Th\u00e9r\u00e8se stands for the quotidian grind that we all suffer from, and the eventual beatification that can be found in it,' said Sheridan Gilley, a reader in theology at Durham University. 'So she has a huge number of followers who are not Catholic. 'The role of relics in the life of English Catholics has been played down,' said Gilley, adding that they would receive an enthusiastic welcome in Britain. 'Th\u00e9r\u00e8se is the saint to approach with the daily trials and tribulations we all face. She stands for the holiness of small things.' In Ireland, the streets have been thronged in scenes not witnessed since the Pope's visit in 1979. Traffic has ground to a halt out of respect for the 'Th\u00e9r\u00e8semobile', the Mercedes people-carrier that transports her casket around each diocese. 'The visit has succeeded beyond our most optimistic expectations,' said Father Linus Ryan, one of the organisers. 'There is a certain supernatural divine magnetism about it all.' www.catholic.org/saints/saints/",

      "bodyText": "France was plunged into a rancorous examination of its imperial past last night as the country agonised over whether its leading politicians knew of a so-called French 'Gestapo in Algeria' that committed atrocities during the colony's war for independence. General Paul Aussaresses, 83, admitted in a book published on Thursday that he and his men tortured and summarily executed Algerian guerrillas and civilians in the Fifties with, he alleged, the blessing of the French government. Aussaresses was in charge of undercover operations during the battle of Algiers in 1957 at the height of the war for Algerian independence. In the most telling accusation, Aussaresses pointed the finger at Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, Justice Minister at the time and later France's President, saying he was well aware of the practices and condoned them. French historians and journalists are now complaining that it has been impossible to confirm or falsify Aussaresses's allegations because government archives con cerning the 1954-62 war of independence remain closed. It was only on 26 April that Prime Minister Lionel Jospin ordered the government's archives to be opened to historians. The result is likely to be a spate of books and a fraught debate over French wartime excesses. As early as 1955, a French magazine spoke of 'Our Gestapo in Algeria' but, at peace accords signed in 1962, both the Algerian FLN and the French Republic agreed to draw a line under these excesses. For nearly four decades since there has been a conspiracy of silence - now rudely interrupted by Aussaresses's unrepentant memoir. He admits to personally killing 24 Algerians. Aussaresses said: 'Torture's efficient. The majority of people crack and talk. Then, most of the time, we kill them.' Historian Jean Lacouture said: 'I get the feeling that this old soldier is trying to glory in what he did. He's bragging about these crimes.' Successive governments have played down allegations of officially sanctioned use of torture by French forces and avoided calls for a formal inquiry, an official apology or criminal action against those involved.",

There were early complaints about excessive discipline in spending but, correctly, we gave priority to the control of inflation, sustainable public finances and creating the conditions for a full employment society. As a consequence, there has been a seismic shift in British politics. The mantle of competence, the ability of governments to implement their policies while responding effectively to unexpected crises, slipped from the Conservatives after the 1992 ERM crisis and has been confidently assumed by New Labour since 1997.</p> <p>Yet competence is never enough. It is a foundation, not a goal in politics. As a modern social democrat, I strongly believe there is a deeper purpose to our political objectives - to transfer to the majority the opportunities and life-chances previously available only to the privileged few.

It needs a reforming New Labour administration with a range of coherent policies and programmes, rather than patchwork initiatives, that can both tackle the worst social and economic problems and give every individual and family the chance to get on and realise their ambition. Ambition must be New Labour's compass for the second term and beyond.</p> <p>No politician would declare that they were 'against' ambition.

It is about upward mobility, earning more and progressing up the social ladder. That is why the centre-Left has stuck to social democratic goals of 'equality', 'solidarity' and 'fraternity'.

They have manifested themselves in opposition to council house sales, a levelling-down approach to education, an unreformed welfare system and hostility to private enterprise. By the early 1980s, Labour had created the impression that we were hostile to ambition itself. But the notion of ambition, both for the individual and society, is at the heart of modern social democracy. We should be confident in articulating our belief in ambition to the general public.</p> <p>A second-term Labour Government cannot simply be about the completion of 'work in progress'. It is about inaugurating a new age of ambition in our country, a compelling vision of a different kind of society, weaving together the rightful quest for material affluence with a deeper striving for better relationships, stronger families, a vibrant culture, genuine tolerance and diversity and, ultimately, a new balance between work and other aspects of life.</p> <p>What exactly do social democrats mean by promoting ambition? First, it is clearly more than satisfying the instinct to get on in the market economy, though business enterprise is an important means of realising ambition. New Labour needs to promote the idea that personal success is not judged only in terms of financial worth.</p> <p>Being ambitious is about individuals enhancing their sense of self-respect and well being, maybe in 'conventional' forms of work, but also by volunteering, caring and following creative or intellectual pursuits. What concerns social democrats is that the means of realising personal ambition are shared equally.</p> <p>Equally important is being ambitious for our society, not just removing harsh and intolerable social injustices, but promoting a culture where people genuinely have equal worth.

We forget that once-acclaimed virtue of collective action. None has been more assiduous in deriding it as archaic than the commercial interests which used to be the victims of its potency.

We commended a boycott of petrol stations owned by Esso, Exxon's UK arm, as an appropriate response for those who shared that anger. Now that boycott is to become a national campaign, backed by the 500,000 members of Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth. It could well succeed. It was a student campaign which caused Barclays Bank to effect a humiliating retreat from South Africa 15 years ago. More recently, it was pressure from Sheila McKechnie, inspiring director of the Consumers Association, which led to substantial reductions in British car prices. Too often, we lament the tiny influence that individual purchasers can exert on big businesses. We forget that once-acclaimed virtue of collective action. None has been more assiduous in deriding it as archaic than the commercial interests which used to be the victims of its potency. But collective action is not just a virtue in the political arena or the workplace. It has a critical place in the post-industrial world too, as Exxon may be about to discover. Consumers of the world unite. Unity is strength.",

In the late Seventies National Savings paid 15 per cent but, since inflation was higher than this (18 per cent in 1980), savers were actually getting a negative return. Nowadays, with inflation at 2.3 per cent, savers in accounts paying 5 per cent are getting 2.7 per cent in real terms. </p> <p><strong> Equities </strong><br> </p> <p> Returns on equities are likely to fall in the long-term even if, in the short term, the prices jump when the Bank of England base rate is cut. The authors of the Financial Services Authority's paper on low inflation say: 'Over the longer term, it will be associated with lower nominal investment returns. Lenders and investors do not have to be compensated so much for the erosion in the real terms of the principal [as they would in a period of high inflation].' </p> <p>The fact that the FSA's growth estimates, which pensions firms must use in their sales material, are now 5, 7 and 9 per cent for the coming years indicates the regulator's view on likely investment returns. At the beginning of the Nineties, when inflation was often three or four times the current level, the equivalent figures were 8.5, 10.75 and 13 per cent. </p> <p>Actuary Ronnie Sloan accepts the likelihood of lower returns on equities.But he says: 'In real terms, it would still seem reasonable to expect returns of between 4 and 5 per cent. When inflation was 7 per cent, people were often getting 13 per cent. But if inflation is 2.5 per cent, you're only going to get 7 per cent.' </p> <p><strong> Guaranteed annuities </strong><br> </p> <p> Annuities guaranteeing to pay above the prevailing rates can become extremely valuable, as the crisis-ridden Equitable Life knows to its cost. The insurer agreed to pay above 12 per cent. This did not appear high at the time of the guarantee but is now getting on for double the going rate. Other insurers entered into these contracts but seem better able to pay their debts than Equitable. </p> <p><strong> Pensions </strong><br> </p> <p> High inflation has always been the enemy of pensioners and anyone else living on a fixed income. The Pensions Law Handbook 2001, published by the law practice Eversheds, says: 'The basic state pension is falling in relative terms year by year, since it is indexed to prices rather than earnings, and will eventually be worth less than 5 per cent of national average earnings. </p> <p>'This problem is exacerbated by the fact that people in personal pensions and in occupational money purchase schemes have to buy an annuity. Most have opted for a level annuity, which means they are getting the same monthly payment after 30 years as they did in month one. </p> <p>'But there has been widespread recognition of this problem and various factors are conspiring to help. A period of low inflation will mean that the value of pensions will erode more slowly. But if they can afford it, pensioners can delay buying an annuity until their seventy-fifth birthday. Meanwhile, they can put their pension fund into an income drawdown plan, drawing some income while leaving most of the fund to continue growing.' </p> <p>However, most professionals suggest this is potentially risky, and that drawdown plans should be taken out only by people with a fund of \u00a3250,000 or more who can withstand some risk. Research by Money Management magazine shows that some of these plans, which are still fairly new, have underperformed their annuity equivalents by nearly 25 per cent. </p> <p>A huge concern for new pensioners is the way that annuity rates have tumbled as a reaction to falling inflation and lower interest rates. A \u00a3100,000 fund would have bought annual annuity income of \u00a311,000 in 1990 for a 65-year old married man; a decade later, the annual income would have been just \u00a36,000. Although there is a slight recovery in annuity rates now, the general trend in interest rates throughout the European Union is down. </p> <p> Money Management magazine warns : 'Ironically, this could, in turn, mean that by delaying annuity purchase, income drawdown may actually reduce pension entitlements and develop into another sorry scandal.' </p> <p><strong> Bonds </strong><br> </p> <p> Getting into a good fixed interest deal is ideal if you can do it just before interest rates fall. Many people benefited from this in the past but often more by luck than judgment since rates are hard to predict. </p> <p>If your calculation is wrong, and you buy a gilt (a Government stock such as a Trea sury bond), you will see its capital value fall if interest rates rise. Its final redemption value will not change, but its value on the market if you decide to sell before redemption will decline. This is because other assets will be able to offer comparable or better returns. Many insurance company products are bonds. </p> <p>Rates on guaranteed income bonds (GIBs) have gradually fallen to the extent they are no longer an attractive proposition, according to financial adviser Baronworth. In April, however, rates improved and some of them are now competitive. </p> <p>With-profits bonds allow investors to take 5 per cent of their original investment each year and defer the tax for up to 20 years. But if investment returns are low, the investors may be eating into the capital when they take out their annual 5 per cent. The Financial Services Authority is extremely concerned about these products and warns that the past performance rates, which companies use to sell their products, are very high compared to current projection rates and may well not be sustainable in future. </p> <p><strong> Salaries </strong><br> </p> <p> Pay rises are closely linked to inflation. Wage settlements have averaged 3.3 per cent a year so far during 2001, according to Incomes Data Services, but they could drop to 3 per cent or even below that if the inflation rate dips below 2 per cent, as seems possible. </p> <p><strong> Mortgages and debt </strong><br> </p> <p> Don't be fooled into thinking that low inflation is good for borrowers. Certainly, you are borrowing at low rates but you do not see your debts become smaller each year compared to your earnings as you do during high inflation. High inflation will, in effect, pay off most of your debt, leaving you just to worry about meeting the interest payments. </p> <p>In times of very low inflation, where asset prices fall, homeowners will be left with loans that are higher than the value of the asset they used the loan to buy. The consensus from economists is to repay your debt as quickly as possible. Howard Davies, chairman of the FSA, expressed his concern last December about the continuing rise in loans at high income multiples: above three times income for a single person or 2.5 times income for joint borrowers. </p> <p><strong> House prices </strong><br> </p> <p> House prices could be underpinned by low inflation if more young people want to buy. In theory, they would be attracted to bricks and mortar since the burden of debt is pushed away from the monthly interest payments, which are low, to the time of mortgage redemption, which could be 25 years away for those choosing an interest-only loan. </p> <p>Of course, problematic low inflation which turns into problematic deflation can lead to negative equity, but this possibility is not being suggested as likely now.</p>",

      "body": "<p>House prices appear to be shrugging off worries about job losses and a faltering economy, at least for the moment. </p> <p>The start of this year's spring buying season coincided with the stock market crash and a string of job cuts across the country. But a clutch of statistics out last week show that buyers have not been frightened away. </p> <p>Prices are not rising at levels of this time last year but the Nationwide building society says the market is 'healthy and stable' . </p> <p>Prices across the country rose by 0.8 per cent in April, according to Nationwide's index. This was down from 1.4 per cent in March and contrasts with a 1.7 per cent increase recorded by rival Halifax during April. </p> <p>But mortgage industry sources believe that the Nationwide's index may have been skewed by a fall-off in mortgage deals resulting from changes to the building society's mortgage range. </p> <p>Mortgage brokers claim that borrowers are shying away because Nationwide no longer offers deeply discounted products, even though its rate for existing borrowers is lower. </p> <p>Nationwide says the aver age price tag on a house this month is \u00a386,244 -in contrast to \u00a31,500 50 years ago. House prices were still 10 per cent short of the level reached at the height of the late-Eighties boom. But the society says recent reductions in mortgage rates should fuel further growth. </p> <p>'Despite an expected weakening in the economy the market remains on course to achieve our forecast of a 7 per cent rise in house prices this year.' </p> <p>Further cuts in interest rates could push house prices up even higher, although the impact of lower borrowing costs could be softened by the slowing economy. </p> <p>Rival Halifax is more bullish, saying that consumer confidence will hold up for the rest of the year, again due to the lower interest rates. </p> <p>New home loan figures also hit a record high recently, further defying analysts who foresaw a downturn in the housing market as the global economy faltered. </p> <p>The British Bankers' Association says new mortgage lending grew 28 per cent during March to \u00a37.65 billion, the highest level since 1997 and well beyond any seasonal upturn as homebuyers rushed to take advantage of the competitive deals on the market. </p> <p>The BBA says the figures suggest we are either in, or about to enter, a housing boom.

      "bodyText": "House prices appear to be shrugging off worries about job losses and a faltering economy, at least for the moment. The start of this year's spring buying season coincided with the stock market crash and a string of job cuts across the country. But a clutch of statistics out last week show that buyers have not been frightened away. Prices are not rising at levels of this time last year but the Nationwide building society says the market is 'healthy and stable' . Prices across the country rose by 0.8 per cent in April, according to Nationwide's index. This was down from 1.4 per cent in March and contrasts with a 1.7 per cent increase recorded by rival Halifax during April. But mortgage industry sources believe that the Nationwide's index may have been skewed by a fall-off in mortgage deals resulting from changes to the building society's mortgage range. Mortgage brokers claim that borrowers are shying away because Nationwide no longer offers deeply discounted products, even though its rate for existing borrowers is lower. Nationwide says the aver age price tag on a house this month is \u00a386,244 -in contrast to \u00a31,500 50 years ago. House prices were still 10 per cent short of the level reached at the height of the late-Eighties boom. But the society says recent reductions in mortgage rates should fuel further growth. 'Despite an expected weakening in the economy the market remains on course to achieve our forecast of a 7 per cent rise in house prices this year.' Further cuts in interest rates could push house prices up even higher, although the impact of lower borrowing costs could be softened by the slowing economy. Rival Halifax is more bullish, saying that consumer confidence will hold up for the rest of the year, again due to the lower interest rates. New home loan figures also hit a record high recently, further defying analysts who foresaw a downturn in the housing market as the global economy faltered. The British Bankers' Association says new mortgage lending grew 28 per cent during March to \u00a37.65 billion, the highest level since 1997 and well beyond any seasonal upturn as homebuyers rushed to take advantage of the competitive deals on the market. The BBA says the figures suggest we are either in, or about to enter, a housing boom. It says consumer confidence is high as a result of falling interest rates, the prospect of possible further rate cuts to come, and the price war between major mortgage lenders. The strong upswing in the mortgage market could last for several months, according to the BBA, particularly as the latest figures do not take into account April's base rate reduction, which will have further improved affordability.

      "body": "<b>The First War 1989-1991 </b> <br> In time, no one in Colombia knew Pablo Escobar better than Colonel Hugo Martinez of La Polic\u00eda Nacional de Colombia (PNC), even though the two men had never met. The tall, tac iturn man who was nicknamed Flaco (Skinny) knew Pablo better than even the drug boss's closest family members and henchmen, because there were things he would say and do before his associates that he would not before his family, and there was a side of him that his family saw that he showed to no one else. The colonel saw it all. He knew Pablo intimately. He recognised his voice, knew his habits, when he slept, when and how he moved, what he liked to eat, what his favourite music was. The colonel knew what kind of shoes Pablo wore (white Nikes), what kind of sheets he liked on his bed, the preferred age of his sexual partners (girls of 14 or 15, usually), his taste in art, his handwriting, the pet name he had for his wife (Tata), even what kind of toilet he preferred to use - since he had new facilities installed in all of his hideouts, and they were always the same. <p>In the world's most dangerous country, the job of going after Pablo was the most dangerous position of all - and it belonged to Colonel Martinez. With the new bonanza of American assistance, Colombia's President Barco had created special police units, one of which was based in Medell\u00edn and was dedicated to hunting down the drug lords Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez Gacha, the Ochoa brothers and Pablo Escobar. It was called the Bloque de B\u00fasqueda, or Search Bloc. This was the command given to Colonel Martinez. Nobody wanted it. It was considered so dangerous that the PNC decided the command would be rotated monthly. </p> <p>Pablo practically owned Medell\u00edn, his home city, including enough of its police force that one of the rules for this newly constituted Search Bloc was that it could not contain even one native of the region, for fear he would secretly be on Pablo's payroll. Instead, the national police had assembled a collection of men from different units.None of them was familiar with one another or with the city, and they had no local sources or informants. </p> <p>Within the first 15 days, 30 of the colonel's 200 men were killed. Despite elaborate precautions to protect the men and hide their identities, Pablo's army of henchmen picked them off one by one, often with the help of the Medell\u00edn police. They shot them down on the street, on their way home from work, even at home with their families when they were off duty. The funerals for these slain officers left the PNC reeling. At police headquarters in Bogot\u00e1, the top command considered pulling the plug on the Search Bloc. The colonel and his top commanders asked that they be allowed to stay. While the killings grieved and frightened them, it also angered them and hardened their resolve. It was to be seriously tested. </p> <p>During a weekend trip home to see his family, the colonel was surprised when a retired police officer, someone he had known since his days in the academy, arrived at his door. </p> <p>'I come to talk to you obligated,' the retired officer said with a pained expression. Martinez asked what he meant. 'If I did not agree to come talk to you, they could easily kill me or my family,' he said. Then he offered the colonel a $6m bribe from Pablo Escobar to call off the hunt. Better yet, the officer explained, 'Continue the work, but do not do yourself or Pablo Escobar any real damage.' Pablo also wanted a list of any snitches inside his own organisation. </p> <p>Sometimes the fate of an entire nation can hinge on the integrity of one man. The bribe came at the lowest point in the colonel's career. He had been given a suicide mission, one with little chance of success. He attended funerals almost every day. The national police had con structed special funeral chapels in Medell\u00edn and in Bogot\u00e1 just to handle the demand. </p> <p>And for what? Martinez could not even see the wisdom in going after Escobar. Cocaine was not Colombia's problem; it was the norteamericanos ' problem. And even if they did away with El Doctor, as the US insisted, it was not going to curb the cocaine industry. </p> <p>Here was a generous ticket out. Six million dollars. Enough money to support himself and his family in luxury for the rest of their lives. But the colonel's gut rebelled against it. He cursed at his former friend, and then his anger turned to pity and disgust. </p> <p>'Tell Pablo that you came but did not find me here, and then leave this matter as if it had never occurred,' he said. </p> <p>Martinez had known other police officers who took bribes, and he knew that money was just the hook on El Doctor's line. Once he had accepted the bribe, Pablo would own him, just as he owned his friend who had approached him with the offer. After he dismissed his old friend, Martinez drove to police headquarters and informed his commander General Octavio Vargas of the bribe. They agreed it was a good sign. </p> <p>'It means we're getting to him,' said Martinez. They were - in part because they had a new kind of help...</p> <p> <b> The Americans are coming</b> <br></p> <p> Various American agencies had been working out of the embassy in Bogot\u00e1 for years, relying on more conventional ways of gathering intelligence. The CIA had its own long-standing connections, but they had always been oriented more toward the Marxist insurrections in the hills. The counternarcotics stuff had only recently been redefined as a CIA mission, and there were plenty of chiefs back at headquarters who were not sold on the idea. But the agents in Colombia were fully engaged. With deep pockets and a reputation for secrecy, the spy agency was already playing on murderous rivalries between the Cali and Medell\u00edn cartels. </p> <p>There was another unit, a secret unit headed in Bogota by an army major who, at least according to his current identity papers, was named Steve Jacoby. Members of the unit were new kinds of species, surveillance experts selected and trained by the army to provide 'operational' intelligence, things like: how many doors and windows does the target building have? Where did their target like to eat dinner? The unit was called Centra Spike. Its speciality was finding people. Eavesdropping on radio and telephone conversations from the air, they were capable of pinpointing the origin of a radio or cell-phone call with amazing accuracy within seconds. </p> <p> <b> Pablo in 'prison' - though not for long</b> <br></p> <p> By the end of 1990, Pablo's life was also a nightmare. Colonel Martinez had come close to catching him several times and had chipped away at the people around him. The deaths of his cousins and brother-in-law, the surrenders of the Ochoas... his organisation was falling apart. The man who just a year earlier had dozens of luxurious estates to chose from was now sleeping some nights in the woods in the mountains, running to stay ahead of his determined pursuers. He dared not speak by radio or telephone, so he sent messages by courier. He had neither the time nor the means of controlling his cocaine business, so every month that he spent on the run he lost money and standing. By the end of the year, he saw only one sure way out of his predicament. He would escape - into the arms of the Colombian government. </p> <p>Pablo would turn himself in, after negotiations between his lawyers and the government. Pablo insisted on being seen not as a criminal but as a revolutionary. He was not seeking a role in the government, but in return for putting down his arms he expected significant concessions. It was simple power versus power, his guns, bombs and sicarios (henchmen) against the state's. By now the issue was only incidentally connected to drug trafficking. Pablo was playing a dangerous game, because if the colonel and Centra Spike succeeded in finding him first, he would most likely be killed or, if not, extradited immediately. He had been indicted in three states in the United States. The alternative being worked out by his lawyers may have been the most generous plea bargain of all time. He would have his own special 'prison', which would be built in his home-town of Envigado on a hill called La Catedral, on land that he owned. He would pay to have it built. The guards in the prison would work not for the Bureau of Prisons but for the government of Envigado, which Pablo effectively controlled. The only inmates would be his closest associates and henchmen. </p> <p>It was not a normal prison in other ways. Pablo, for instance, did not feel obliged to actually stay. He rarely missed an important pro soccer game in Medell\u00edn - police would block off traffic to allow Pablo's motorcade easy access to and from the stadium he had built years before - and he was sighted shopping in a fashionable Bogot\u00e1 mall over the Christmas holidays. In June 1992 he celebrated the first anniversary of his imprisonment with his friends and family at an Envigado nightclub. Pablo considered such excursions minor... he did, after all, always come back. He had made his deal with the state and intended to honour it - even if he did put one over on his jailors now and then. </p> <p>To pass time, the inmates lifted weights, rode exercise bikes and played soccer. Pablo would play for hours at a time. He always played centre forward, even though he wasn't the quickest or most skilled player and he had a bad knee. His men always let him win, sometimes arranging for him to kick the winning goal. If Pablo grew winded, which was often, he would wave in a replacement until he caught his breath, and then he'd plunge back in. Prison guards served drinks to the inmates on the sidelines and doubled as waiters in the bar afterward. </p> <p>Throughout the first year of Pablo's imprisonment, the US embassy, the press and many government officials - including Mendoza - had urged the president to end the charade. Everyone knew La Catedral was no prison. Effectively, it was a state within the state. The surrender agreement had been a capitulation to violence, pure and simple, a deal with the devil. Still, most of official Colombia was happy to live with it. Pablo was like a dangerous snake that had been driven into a hole. The prevailing attitude was: before, Pablo Escobar ruled Colombia; now he rules Envigado, so leave him alone. </p> <p>However, after much indecision, the president decided he had to act. He first sent justice minister Eduardo Mendoza to negotiate with Escobar, followed by a special armed unit when Escobar decided he would amuse himself by holding Mendoza hostage. By this stage, because of radio and TV reports, Escobar and the rest of the country knew that armed forces were massing around his prison. Any hope for surprise was gone. Even so, after the special forces attacked, chaos ensued... and Pablo escaped. In fact, it turned out that he had walked out. He and his brother Roberto had led a small group of his men uphill, past the camouflaged cabanas, cut a hole in the wire fence and walked over the top of the hill - and right past soldiers either too friendly or too intimidated to stop them. The 'tunnel' spoken of in the intercepted phone conversations was, of course, the inmates' sarcastic term for the covered truck that had been used to roll contraband - women, weapons, money, alcohol - up and down the mountain, right under the disinterested noses of prison guards. The war against the government quickly resumed. </p> <p> <b> The revenge of Los Pepes</b> <br></p> <p> By the end of 1992, 12 major players in Pablo's organisation had been killed in 'gun battles' with the Search Bloc. There was always a steep price to pay for these victories. Through the first six months of the hunt, more than 65 police officers had been killed in Medell\u00edn, many of them Search Bloc members whose identities were supposed to be a state secret. Often these men were killed in their homes or travelling to and from the academy, which demonstrated that Pablo knew not only their identities but also their work shifts and home addresses. Pablo was offering a $2,000 bounty for killing Medell\u00edn policemen, and it was working. </p> <p>What the authorities needed was some extralegal muscle, some hands-on players who didn't mind crossing the lines of legality and morality that Pablo so blithely ignored. The drug boss certainly didn't lack for bitter enemies, but they had no commonality. They ranged from some of the wealthiest and most powerful families in Bogot\u00e1 to rival street thugs in Medell\u00edn and Cali, a 'civilian militia'. Acquiring the name Los Pepes, they initiated a controlled bloodbath, controlled because all of the victims had one thing in common - Pablo Escobar. As the murders and fearful surrenders mounted, Los Pepes publicly offered cash rewards for information on Pablo and his key associates, and began broadcasting threats against the drug lord's family. </p> <p>What if someone were to give them a push, some organisation, some money, some intelligence, some training, planning,and leadership? Los Pepes were so perfect they were... well, too perfect. Officially the American Embassy was silent on the appearance of Los Pepes, but those at work in the fight against Escobar - including Centra Spike - were not displeased. And why should they have been? What could be better than a homegrown vigilante movement against Public Enemy Number One? Why not spread a little fear on Pablo's side for once? As the lawlessness accelerated, no one from Washington questioned it, or questioned America's commitment to the pursuit. Civilian overseers from the Clinton administration were new in office, and knew next to nothing about what the US military was doing in Colombia. People were always getting killed by one faction or another... </p> <p> <b> Closing in for the kill</b> <br></p> <p> Young Hugo Martinez looked nothing like his father. He was short, stocky and dark where his father was tall, fair and slender. He shared his father's keen intellect, but was also a visionary, an infectious leader, the kind of man who could convince other people to follow him even when only he understood where they were going. When he got talking about technical matters that often only he understood, Hugo flushed with pleasure. He would grab sheets of paper and a pencil and begin making scratchy diagrams of his ideas. After studying at the National Police Academy in Bogota, he was placed with an electronic-surveillance unit that had been given a new portable direction-finder by the CIA. </p> <p>In the first three or four months after Pablo's escape, Colonel Martinez banned all cell-phone use in Medell\u00edn and closed down all repeater stations for transmitting signals, which forced people to use standard phone lines and limited radio communications to point-to-point - that is, the radio operators could not use repeaters to amplify and relay signals over long distances, so the only effective way to communicate between two radios was for there to be a clear line of sight between the transmitter and receiver. The idea was to isolate Pablo. He was too smart to use normal phone lines, but if he tried to communicate through the uncluttered airwaves he would be much easier to find. Pablo responded by using messengers. He resumed regular radio communication only in the spring of 1993, as he grew increasingly concerned about Los Pepes and began scheming to get his family out of the country. Pablo found places where he could see the top of the apartment building Altos del Campestre, where his family was living under heavy guard, and he spoke most often to his son Juan Pablo. The chase had boiled down to a contest between two men and their sons. Pablo's son was his weakness. The colonel's son might yet prove to be his strength. </p> <p>On 26 November, the US embassy learned that Pablo's wife and children were planning once more to flee Colombia. They were going to fly to either London or Frankfurt. The family had become increasingly desperate. They had been under around-the-clock protection by agents from attorney general de Grieff's office ever since the failed effort to fly Juan Pablo and Manuela to Miami in March. In the intervening months, Los Pepes had killed members of their extended family and burned most of the family's properties. The vigilante group seemed to be toying with the Escobars, picking off cousins, in-laws and friends, including some who had been living in Altos del Campestre, demonstrating that they could hurt Pablo's wife Maria Victoria or Juan Pablo. The rocket-propelled grenade that had been fired at the building in October was more like a warning than an actual attempt on their lives. It felt like the threat was closing in. The Colombian government was officially protecting Pablo's family, but they were also effectively holding them in place. So long as Pablo was worried about them, his voice would keep popping up on the radio. </p> <p> <b> The final shootout</b> <br></p> <p> On 2 December 1993, Pablo awoke shortly before noon, as was his habit, and ate a plate of spaghetti before easing his widening bulk back into bed with his wireless phone. Always a heavy man, he had put on about 20lb living on the run, most of it in his belly. 'On the run' didn't accurately describe it. He spent most of his time lying low, eating, sleeping, talking on the radio. He hired prostitutes, mostly teenage girls, to help him while away the hours. He had trouble finding jeans that would fit him. To get a waist size to accommodate his girth he had to wear pants that were a good 6in too long in the leg. </p> <p>The light-blue pair he wore on this day were turned up twice in a wide cuff. He wore flip-flops and had pulled on a loose blue polo shirt. Prone to stomach disorders, he might have been feeling the effects of his birthday revelry the night before. On this afternoon, the only other person in the house was his bodyguard Alvero de Jesus Agudelo, known as Lim\u00f3n. The two others staying with them, his courier Jaime Rua and his aunt and cook Luz Mila, had gone out after fixing breakfast. At one o'clock, Pablo tried to phone his family, posing as a radio journalist, but the switchboard operator at the Tequendama, per his instructions from Colonel Martinez, told him they had been instructed to block all calls from journalists. He was put on hold, then asked to call back, but finally he got through on the third attempt, speaking briefly to Manuela and then to Maria Victoria and his son. </p> <p>Hugo and his unit had been closing in on Escobar, monitoring his calls. Hugo had driven out of the parking lot in pursuit as soon as his friend on the switchboard at the Hotel Tequendama had alerted him that Pablo was on the line. </p> <p>The signal pointed Hugo straight ahead. The line on the screen lengthened and the tone in his earphones grew stronger as they proceeded up the street. They drove until the signal peaked and then began to diminish, the line pinching in at the edges of the screen and the tone slightly falling off. So they turned around and crept back the other way more slowly. The line stretched gradually until it once again filled the screen. They were in front of a block of two-storey houses. There was no telling which was the one that housed Pablo. They cruised up and down the street several more times. Hugo stopped staring at his screen and instead stared intently at the houses, one by one. </p> <p>Until he saw him. </p> <p>A fat man in the second-floor window. He had long, curly black hair and a full beard. The image hit Hugo like an electric shock. He had only seen Pablo in pictures, and he had always been clean shaven except for the mustache, but they knew Pablo had grown a beard, and there was something about the man in the window that just clicked. He was talking on a cell phone and peering down at traffic. The man stepped back from the window. Hugo thought he had seen a look of surprise. The face of Pablo Escobar assembled slowly in Hugo's brain. For a split second he was confused, disbelieving. Him! He had found him! Years of effort, hundreds of lives, thousands of futile police raids, untold millions of dollars, countless false leads and man-hours, all of the false steps, false alarms, blunders... and here he was at last, one man in a nation of 35m people, one man in a rich, ruthless, and regimented underworld he had virtually owned for nearly two decades, one man in a city of millions where he was revered as a legend. </p> <p>Hugo leaned out of his van and called to the car behind him, 'This is the house!' It was in the middle of the block. Hugo suspected Pablo had been spooked by their white van cruising slowly down the street, so he had told his driver to keep on going down to the end. Shouting into the radio, Hugo asked to be connected to his father. 'I've got him located,' Hugo told him. The colonel knew this was it. Those were words he had never heard before. He knew Hugo would not be saying it unless he had seen Pablo with his own eyes. </p> <p>'He's in this house,' said Hugo. He explained excitedly that only he and one other car were there. He thought Pablo had seen him and that his gunmen were probably on their way. He wanted to clear out, fast. 'Stay exactly where you are!' Colonel Martinez ordered his son, shouting into the radio. 'Station yourself in front and in back of the house and don't let him come out.' Then the colonel got word to all his units in the area, including those still thrashing through the office building blocks away, and told them to converge on the house immediately. Hugo's two men got out of the car and positioned themselves against the wall on either side of Pablo's front door. Hugo drove the van around the block to the alley, counting the houses until he could see the back end of Pablo's. Terrified, with weapons ready, they waited. It took 10 minutes. </p> <p>There was a heavy metal front door. Martin, one of the lieutenants assigned to the Search Bloc assault team, stood ready as his men applied a heavy steel sledgehammer to it. Martin had not worn his bullet-proof vest today, and he had a moment of anxious regret, just as the hammer crashed into the door. It took several blows before it went down. </p> <p>Martin sprinted into the house with the five men on his team, and the shooting started. In the din and confusion, he quickly sized up the first floor. It was empty, like a garage. There was a yellow taxi parked toward the rear, and a flight of stairs leading up to the second floor. One of Martin's men stumbled on his way up the stairs, and everyone stopped momentarily. They thought the man had been hit. </p> <p>Lim\u00f3n leaped out a back window to the orange tile roof as soon as the team burst through the front door. The way the house was constructed, there was a back roof surrounded by walls on three sides that could be reached by dropping about 10ft from a second-storey window. Lim\u00f3n hit the tiles and began running, and as he did the Search Bloc members arrayed in the street behind the house opened fire. There were dozens of men up and down the block with automatic weapons, some of them standing on the tops of their cars. Lim\u00f3n was hit several times as he ran. His momentum carried him right off the roof. He fell to the grass below. Then came Pablo. He stopped to kick off his flip-flops, then jumped down to the roof. Having seen what had happened to Lim\u00f3n, he stayed close to one wall, where there was some protection.

      "bodyText": "The First War 1989-1991 In time, no one in Colombia knew Pablo Escobar better than Colonel Hugo Martinez of La Polic\u00eda Nacional de Colombia (PNC), even though the two men had never met. The tall, tac iturn man who was nicknamed Flaco (Skinny) knew Pablo better than even the drug boss's closest family members and henchmen, because there were things he would say and do before his associates that he would not before his family, and there was a side of him that his family saw that he showed to no one else. The colonel saw it all. He knew Pablo intimately. He recognised his voice, knew his habits, when he slept, when and how he moved, what he liked to eat, what his favourite music was. The colonel knew what kind of shoes Pablo wore (white Nikes), what kind of sheets he liked on his bed, the preferred age of his sexual partners (girls of 14 or 15, usually), his taste in art, his handwriting, the pet name he had for his wife (Tata), even what kind of toilet he preferred to use - since he had new facilities installed in all of his hideouts, and they were always the same. In the world's most dangerous country, the job of going after Pablo was the most dangerous position of all - and it belonged to Colonel Martinez. With the new bonanza of American assistance, Colombia's President Barco had created special police units, one of which was based in Medell\u00edn and was dedicated to hunting down the drug lords Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez Gacha, the Ochoa brothers and Pablo Escobar. It was called the Bloque de B\u00fasqueda, or Search Bloc. This was the command given to Colonel Martinez. Nobody wanted it. It was considered so dangerous that the PNC decided the command would be rotated monthly. Pablo practically owned Medell\u00edn, his home city, including enough of its police force that one of the rules for this newly constituted Search Bloc was that it could not contain even one native of the region, for fear he would secretly be on Pablo's payroll. Instead, the national police had assembled a collection of men from different units.None of them was familiar with one another or with the city, and they had no local sources or informants. Within the first 15 days, 30 of the colonel's 200 men were killed. Despite elaborate precautions to protect the men and hide their identities, Pablo's army of henchmen picked them off one by one, often with the help of the Medell\u00edn police. They shot them down on the street, on their way home from work, even at home with their families when they were off duty. The funerals for these slain officers left the PNC reeling. At police headquarters in Bogot\u00e1, the top command considered pulling the plug on the Search Bloc. The colonel and his top commanders asked that they be allowed to stay. While the killings grieved and frightened them, it also angered them and hardened their resolve. It was to be seriously tested. During a weekend trip home to see his family, the colonel was surprised when a retired police officer, someone he had known since his days in the academy, arrived at his door. 'I come to talk to you obligated,' the retired officer said with a pained expression. Martinez asked what he meant. 'If I did not agree to come talk to you, they could easily kill me or my family,' he said. Then he offered the colonel a $6m bribe from Pablo Escobar to call off the hunt. Better yet, the officer explained, 'Continue the work, but do not do yourself or Pablo Escobar any real damage.' Pablo also wanted a list of any snitches inside his own organisation. Sometimes the fate of an entire nation can hinge on the integrity of one man. The bribe came at the lowest point in the colonel's career. He had been given a suicide mission, one with little chance of success. He attended funerals almost every day. The national police had con structed special funeral chapels in Medell\u00edn and in Bogot\u00e1 just to handle the demand. And for what? Martinez could not even see the wisdom in going after Escobar. Cocaine was not Colombia's problem; it was the norteamericanos ' problem. And even if they did away with El Doctor, as the US insisted, it was not going to curb the cocaine industry. Here was a generous ticket out. Six million dollars. Enough money to support himself and his family in luxury for the rest of their lives. But the colonel's gut rebelled against it. He cursed at his former friend, and then his anger turned to pity and disgust. 'Tell Pablo that you came but did not find me here, and then leave this matter as if it had never occurred,' he said. Martinez had known other police officers who took bribes, and he knew that money was just the hook on El Doctor's line. Once he had accepted the bribe, Pablo would own him, just as he owned his friend who had approached him with the offer. After he dismissed his old friend, Martinez drove to police headquarters and informed his commander General Octavio Vargas of the bribe. They agreed it was a good sign. 'It means we're getting to him,' said Martinez. They were - in part because they had a new kind of help... The Americans are coming Various American agencies had been working out of the embassy in Bogot\u00e1 for years, relying on more conventional ways of gathering intelligence. The CIA had its own long-standing connections, but they had always been oriented more toward the Marxist insurrections in the hills. The counternarcotics stuff had only recently been redefined as a CIA mission, and there were plenty of chiefs back at headquarters who were not sold on the idea. But the agents in Colombia were fully engaged. With deep pockets and a reputation for secrecy, the spy agency was already playing on murderous rivalries between the Cali and Medell\u00edn cartels. There was another unit, a secret unit headed in Bogota by an army major who, at least according to his current identity papers, was named Steve Jacoby. Members of the unit were new kinds of species, surveillance experts selected and trained by the army to provide 'operational' intelligence, things like: how many doors and windows does the target building have? Where did their target like to eat dinner? The unit was called Centra Spike. Its speciality was finding people. Eavesdropping on radio and telephone conversations from the air, they were capable of pinpointing the origin of a radio or cell-phone call with amazing accuracy within seconds. Pablo in 'prison' - though not for long By the end of 1990, Pablo's life was also a nightmare. Colonel Martinez had come close to catching him several times and had chipped away at the people around him. The deaths of his cousins and brother-in-law, the surrenders of the Ochoas... his organisation was falling apart. The man who just a year earlier had dozens of luxurious estates to chose from was now sleeping some nights in the woods in the mountains, running to stay ahead of his determined pursuers. He dared not speak by radio or telephone, so he sent messages by courier. He had neither the time nor the means of controlling his cocaine business, so every month that he spent on the run he lost money and standing. By the end of the year, he saw only one sure way out of his predicament. He would escape - into the arms of the Colombian government. Pablo would turn himself in, after negotiations between his lawyers and the government. Pablo insisted on being seen not as a criminal but as a revolutionary. He was not seeking a role in the government, but in return for putting down his arms he expected significant concessions. It was simple power versus power, his guns, bombs and sicarios (henchmen) against the state's. By now the issue was only incidentally connected to drug trafficking. Pablo was playing a dangerous game, because if the colonel and Centra Spike succeeded in finding him first, he would most likely be killed or, if not, extradited immediately. He had been indicted in three states in the United States. The alternative being worked out by his lawyers may have been the most generous plea bargain of all time. He would have his own special 'prison', which would be built in his home-town of Envigado on a hill called La Catedral, on land that he owned. He would pay to have it built. The guards in the prison would work not for the Bureau of Prisons but for the government of Envigado, which Pablo effectively controlled. The only inmates would be his closest associates and henchmen. It was not a normal prison in other ways. Pablo, for instance, did not feel obliged to actually stay. He rarely missed an important pro soccer game in Medell\u00edn - police would block off traffic to allow Pablo's motorcade easy access to and from the stadium he had built years before - and he was sighted shopping in a fashionable Bogot\u00e1 mall over the Christmas holidays. In June 1992 he celebrated the first anniversary of his imprisonment with his friends and family at an Envigado nightclub. Pablo considered such excursions minor... he did, after all, always come back. He had made his deal with the state and intended to honour it - even if he did put one over on his jailors now and then. To pass time, the inmates lifted weights, rode exercise bikes and played soccer. Pablo would play for hours at a time. He always played centre forward, even though he wasn't the quickest or most skilled player and he had a bad knee. His men always let him win, sometimes arranging for him to kick the winning goal. If Pablo grew winded, which was often, he would wave in a replacement until he caught his breath, and then he'd plunge back in. Prison guards served drinks to the inmates on the sidelines and doubled as waiters in the bar afterward. Throughout the first year of Pablo's imprisonment, the US embassy, the press and many government officials - including Mendoza - had urged the president to end the charade. Everyone knew La Catedral was no prison. Effectively, it was a state within the state. The surrender agreement had been a capitulation to violence, pure and simple, a deal with the devil. Still, most of official Colombia was happy to live with it. Pablo was like a dangerous snake that had been driven into a hole. The prevailing attitude was: before, Pablo Escobar ruled Colombia; now he rules Envigado, so leave him alone. However, after much indecision, the president decided he had to act. He first sent justice minister Eduardo Mendoza to negotiate with Escobar, followed by a special armed unit when Escobar decided he would amuse himself by holding Mendoza hostage. By this stage, because of radio and TV reports, Escobar and the rest of the country knew that armed forces were massing around his prison. Any hope for surprise was gone. Even so, after the special forces attacked, chaos ensued... and Pablo escaped. In fact, it turned out that he had walked out. He and his brother Roberto had led a small group of his men uphill, past the camouflaged cabanas, cut a hole in the wire fence and walked over the top of the hill - and right past soldiers either too friendly or too intimidated to stop them. The 'tunnel' spoken of in the intercepted phone conversations was, of course, the inmates' sarcastic term for the covered truck that had been used to roll contraband - women, weapons, money, alcohol - up and down the mountain, right under the disinterested noses of prison guards. The war against the government quickly resumed. The revenge of Los Pepes By the end of 1992, 12 major players in Pablo's organisation had been killed in 'gun battles' with the Search Bloc. There was always a steep price to pay for these victories. Through the first six months of the hunt, more than 65 police officers had been killed in Medell\u00edn, many of them Search Bloc members whose identities were supposed to be a state secret. Often these men were killed in their homes or travelling to and from the academy, which demonstrated that Pablo knew not only their identities but also their work shifts and home addresses. Pablo was offering a $2,000 bounty for killing Medell\u00edn policemen, and it was working. What the authorities needed was some extralegal muscle, some hands-on players who didn't mind crossing the lines of legality and morality that Pablo so blithely ignored. The drug boss certainly didn't lack for bitter enemies, but they had no commonality. They ranged from some of the wealthiest and most powerful families in Bogot\u00e1 to rival street thugs in Medell\u00edn and Cali, a 'civilian militia'. Acquiring the name Los Pepes, they initiated a controlled bloodbath, controlled because all of the victims had one thing in common - Pablo Escobar. As the murders and fearful surrenders mounted, Los Pepes publicly offered cash rewards for information on Pablo and his key associates, and began broadcasting threats against the drug lord's family. What if someone were to give them a push, some organisation, some money, some intelligence, some training, planning,and leadership? Los Pepes were so perfect they were... well, too perfect. Officially the American Embassy was silent on the appearance of Los Pepes, but those at work in the fight against Escobar - including Centra Spike - were not displeased. And why should they have been? What could be better than a homegrown vigilante movement against Public Enemy Number One? Why not spread a little fear on Pablo's side for once? As the lawlessness accelerated, no one from Washington questioned it, or questioned America's commitment to the pursuit. Civilian overseers from the Clinton administration were new in office, and knew next to nothing about what the US military was doing in Colombia. People were always getting killed by one faction or another... Closing in for the kill Young Hugo Martinez looked nothing like his father. He was short, stocky and dark where his father was tall, fair and slender. He shared his father's keen intellect, but was also a visionary, an infectious leader, the kind of man who could convince other people to follow him even when only he understood where they were going. When he got talking about technical matters that often only he understood, Hugo flushed with pleasure. He would grab sheets of paper and a pencil and begin making scratchy diagrams of his ideas. After studying at the National Police Academy in Bogota, he was placed with an electronic-surveillance unit that had been given a new portable direction-finder by the CIA. In the first three or four months after Pablo's escape, Colonel Martinez banned all cell-phone use in Medell\u00edn and closed down all repeater stations for transmitting signals, which forced people to use standard phone lines and limited radio communications to point-to-point - that is, the radio operators could not use repeaters to amplify and relay signals over long distances, so the only effective way to communicate between two radios was for there to be a clear line of sight between the transmitter and receiver. The idea was to isolate Pablo. He was too smart to use normal phone lines, but if he tried to communicate through the uncluttered airwaves he would be much easier to find. Pablo responded by using messengers. He resumed regular radio communication only in the spring of 1993, as he grew increasingly concerned about Los Pepes and began scheming to get his family out of the country. Pablo found places where he could see the top of the apartment building Altos del Campestre, where his family was living under heavy guard, and he spoke most often to his son Juan Pablo. The chase had boiled down to a contest between two men and their sons. Pablo's son was his weakness. The colonel's son might yet prove to be his strength. On 26 November, the US embassy learned that Pablo's wife and children were planning once more to flee Colombia. They were going to fly to either London or Frankfurt. The family had become increasingly desperate. They had been under around-the-clock protection by agents from attorney general de Grieff's office ever since the failed effort to fly Juan Pablo and Manuela to Miami in March. In the intervening months, Los Pepes had killed members of their extended family and burned most of the family's properties. The vigilante group seemed to be toying with the Escobars, picking off cousins, in-laws and friends, including some who had been living in Altos del Campestre, demonstrating that they could hurt Pablo's wife Maria Victoria or Juan Pablo. The rocket-propelled grenade that had been fired at the building in October was more like a warning than an actual attempt on their lives. It felt like the threat was closing in. The Colombian government was officially protecting Pablo's family, but they were also effectively holding them in place. So long as Pablo was worried about them, his voice would keep popping up on the radio. The final shootout On 2 December 1993, Pablo awoke shortly before noon, as was his habit, and ate a plate of spaghetti before easing his widening bulk back into bed with his wireless phone. Always a heavy man, he had put on about 20lb living on the run, most of it in his belly. 'On the run' didn't accurately describe it. He spent most of his time lying low, eating, sleeping, talking on the radio. He hired prostitutes, mostly teenage girls, to help him while away the hours. He had trouble finding jeans that would fit him. To get a waist size to accommodate his girth he had to wear pants that were a good 6in too long in the leg. The light-blue pair he wore on this day were turned up twice in a wide cuff. He wore flip-flops and had pulled on a loose blue polo shirt. Prone to stomach disorders, he might have been feeling the effects of his birthday revelry the night before. On this afternoon, the only other person in the house was his bodyguard Alvero de Jesus Agudelo, known as Lim\u00f3n. The two others staying with them, his courier Jaime Rua and his aunt and cook Luz Mila, had gone out after fixing breakfast. At one o'clock, Pablo tried to phone his family, posing as a radio journalist, but the switchboard operator at the Tequendama, per his instructions from Colonel Martinez, told him they had been instructed to block all calls from journalists. He was put on hold, then asked to call back, but finally he got through on the third attempt, speaking briefly to Manuela and then to Maria Victoria and his son. Hugo and his unit had been closing in on Escobar, monitoring his calls. Hugo had driven out of the parking lot in pursuit as soon as his friend on the switchboard at the Hotel Tequendama had alerted him that Pablo was on the line. The signal pointed Hugo straight ahead. The line on the screen lengthened and the tone in his earphones grew stronger as they proceeded up the street. They drove until the signal peaked and then began to diminish, the line pinching in at the edges of the screen and the tone slightly falling off. So they turned around and crept back the other way more slowly. The line stretched gradually until it once again filled the screen. They were in front of a block of two-storey houses. There was no telling which was the one that housed Pablo. They cruised up and down the street several more times. Hugo stopped staring at his screen and instead stared intently at the houses, one by one. Until he saw him. A fat man in the second-floor window. He had long, curly black hair and a full beard. The image hit Hugo like an electric shock. He had only seen Pablo in pictures, and he had always been clean shaven except for the mustache, but they knew Pablo had grown a beard, and there was something about the man in the window that just clicked. He was talking on a cell phone and peering down at traffic. The man stepped back from the window. Hugo thought he had seen a look of surprise. The face of Pablo Escobar assembled slowly in Hugo's brain. For a split second he was confused, disbelieving. Him! He had found him! Years of effort, hundreds of lives, thousands of futile police raids, untold millions of dollars, countless false leads and man-hours, all of the false steps, false alarms, blunders... and here he was at last, one man in a nation of 35m people, one man in a rich, ruthless, and regimented underworld he had virtually owned for nearly two decades, one man in a city of millions where he was revered as a legend. Hugo leaned out of his van and called to the car behind him, 'This is the house!' It was in the middle of the block. Hugo suspected Pablo had been spooked by their white van cruising slowly down the street, so he had told his driver to keep on going down to the end. Shouting into the radio, Hugo asked to be connected to his father. 'I've got him located,' Hugo told him. The colonel knew this was it. Those were words he had never heard before. He knew Hugo would not be saying it unless he had seen Pablo with his own eyes. 'He's in this house,' said Hugo. He explained excitedly that only he and one other car were there. He thought Pablo had seen him and that his gunmen were probably on their way. He wanted to clear out, fast. 'Stay exactly where you are!' Colonel Martinez ordered his son, shouting into the radio. 'Station yourself in front and in back of the house and don't let him come out.' Then the colonel got word to all his units in the area, including those still thrashing through the office building blocks away, and told them to converge on the house immediately. Hugo's two men got out of the car and positioned themselves against the wall on either side of Pablo's front door. Hugo drove the van around the block to the alley, counting the houses until he could see the back end of Pablo's. Terrified, with weapons ready, they waited. It took 10 minutes. There was a heavy metal front door. Martin, one of the lieutenants assigned to the Search Bloc assault team, stood ready as his men applied a heavy steel sledgehammer to it. Martin had not worn his bullet-proof vest today, and he had a moment of anxious regret, just as the hammer crashed into the door. It took several blows before it went down. Martin sprinted into the house with the five men on his team, and the shooting started. In the din and confusion, he quickly sized up the first floor. It was empty, like a garage. There was a yellow taxi parked toward the rear, and a flight of stairs leading up to the second floor. One of Martin's men stumbled on his way up the stairs, and everyone stopped momentarily. They thought the man had been hit. Lim\u00f3n leaped out a back window to the orange tile roof as soon as the team burst through the front door. The way the house was constructed, there was a back roof surrounded by walls on three sides that could be reached by dropping about 10ft from a second-storey window. Lim\u00f3n hit the tiles and began running, and as he did the Search Bloc members arrayed in the street behind the house opened fire. There were dozens of men up and down the block with automatic weapons, some of them standing on the tops of their cars. Lim\u00f3n was hit several times as he ran. His momentum carried him right off the roof. He fell to the grass below. Then came Pablo. He stopped to kick off his flip-flops, then jumped down to the roof. Having seen what had happened to Lim\u00f3n, he stayed close to one wall, where there was some protection. The shooter on the roof overhead could not get a clear shot directly down at him, so there was a break in the firing momentarily as Pablo quickly moved along the wall toward the back street. No one on the street had a clear shot at him yet. At the corner, Pablo made his break. He went for the crest of the gently sloping roof, trying to make it to the other side. There was a thundering cascade of fire and Pablo fell near the crest. He sprawled forward, dislodging orange tiles. The shooting continued. Martin's team inside the house had found the second floor empty. When he stuck his head in the open window to look out on the roof, he saw a body and then heard an eruption of more gunfire. He and his men fell prone on the floor and waited as rounds from the street below crashed through the window and into the walls and ceiling of the room. Martin believed he and his men were taking fire from Pablo's bodyguards. He shouted into his radio, 'Help! Help us! We need support!' Everyone was shooting on automatic from below. Rounds chewed up the brick walls around the enclosed rooftop. It felt as if it took minutes for the shooting to die down, for the Search Bloc to realise they were the only ones shooting. Finally, it stopped. The shooter on the second-floor roof shouted, 'It's Pablo! It's Pablo!' Men were now scaling the roof to see. Someone found a ladder and placed it under the second-floor window, and others climbed down from it. Major Aguilar grabbed the body and turned it over. The wide bearded face was swollen, bloody, and wreathed in long, blood-soaked black curls. The major grabbed a radio and spoke directly to Colonel Martinez, loudly enough for even the men on the street below to hear. ' Viv\u00e1 Colombia ! We have just killed Pablo Escobar!'

      "body": "<p>Hindsight is a valuable thing, not least when it comes to dieting. Having spent many, many years crash-dieting, a surprising number of the patients who seek my help now bitterly regret having ever started starving themselves in the first place. So before you resolve to eat nothing but cabbage soup, or to take slimming drugs, remember that the diet industry would have starved to death years ago if such measures worked in the long run. Indeed, the inventors of all those 'wonder' diets don't actually want them to work in the long term, because that would mean that you'd only have to follow them once, wouldn't it?</p> <p>As boring as it may sound, the only effective way of losing weight is to enjoy a well-balanced diet - which means dispensing with faddish regimes such as food combining - and to exercise regularly. As for the supplements that claim to raise your metabolic rate: the only way of doing this safely is through exercise. It's important to take the right sort of exercise, however, as some activities can leave you feeling exhausted, sick and as heavy as before. These are typically short-duration, high-intensity types of exercise, such as squash and sprinting, that merely burn off sugar to fuel an active body.</p> <p>The most effective kinds of weight-losing exercise are walking briskly for at least 20 to 30 minutes, or cycling, jogging and swimming, all of which involve a less intensive workout, which means that you will be able to keep active for longer, thereby raising your metabolic rate and prompting your lungs and heart to deliver sufficient oxygen to your muscles to enable them to burn off fat. It will take at least six weeks before you notice any results.</p> <p>If you still can't resist embarking on a, say, pre-summer crash diet, take note of the following dangers and downsides before you do so. First, having seen hundreds of long-term dieters in my practice, I can attest to the fact that if you lose weight at a faster rate than 1kg a week on a sustained basis, something strange seems to happen to the metabolic rate (physiologists don't really understand why this happens). As soon as you start eating more than the 500 or 800 or so calories a day that you've been restricting yourself to in order to slim, not only do the pounds pile back on at great speed, but they do so in the form of fat, making any subsequent attempts to lose weight that much harder.</p> <p>Eating too little will also significantly reduce your energy levels, often to the extent that you won't be able to exercise at all because your body will have become so malnourished. You'll feel lousy and increasingly tetchy (dieters are notoriously avoided at the workplace), and your concentration will be compromised. Worse still, if you ingest fewer than 1,000 calories a day, eventually you may actually start hallucinating because your body begins to produce ketones, a form of emergency fuel the body produces when it's deprived of another energy source. Ketones also cause you to lose vital calcium from your bones, which can be particularly serious for people under the age of 20, when strength is still being built into the bones in preparation for the years ahead. Their bones may become so fragile that they end up developing osteoporosis (brittle-bone disease), either when they're still young or, in the case of some women, when they hit the menopause.</p> <p>Teenage girls may stop menstruating if they either lose too much weight or lose a lot rapidly, thereby triggering hormonal changes, and if menstruation is interrupted on a continuous basis, it will compromise not only bone health but also the ability to have children. Anaemia, too, is very common among teenagers who restrict their food intake in search of the so-called 'perfect' body. Crash-dieting usually involves reducing your intake of red meat, green, leafy vegetables and other iron-rich foods (and many teenagers would in any case prefer a slimming shake or bar, or a small portion of junk food, to a steak and salad, which would be far healthier for them), thereby causing the body to become deficient in this nutrient (and many others) which is essential for growth and development, as well as maintaining healthy blood and an effective immune system.</p> <p>My message, then, to all weight watchers is: stop pinning your hopes on dubious 'wonder' diets and start exercising regularly and eating small, well-balanced meals instead. Keep your intake of fat, sugar and alcohol low; eat plenty of vegetables, fruits, lean proteins, pulses and fibres; drink lots of water; eat slowly, and really savour your food. I have your best, long-term interests at heart, so believe me when I tell you that as much as I would love to trumpet the news that a new blood-type or psychological-profile diet works, I can't - they don't. Such diets are merely short-term solutions that have been primarily devised to line their promoters' wallets.</p> <p>Jane Clarke is a state-registered dietician.

      "bodyText": "Hindsight is a valuable thing, not least when it comes to dieting. Having spent many, many years crash-dieting, a surprising number of the patients who seek my help now bitterly regret having ever started starving themselves in the first place. So before you resolve to eat nothing but cabbage soup, or to take slimming drugs, remember that the diet industry would have starved to death years ago if such measures worked in the long run. Indeed, the inventors of all those 'wonder' diets don't actually want them to work in the long term, because that would mean that you'd only have to follow them once, wouldn't it? As boring as it may sound, the only effective way of losing weight is to enjoy a well-balanced diet - which means dispensing with faddish regimes such as food combining - and to exercise regularly. As for the supplements that claim to raise your metabolic rate: the only way of doing this safely is through exercise. It's important to take the right sort of exercise, however, as some activities can leave you feeling exhausted, sick and as heavy as before. These are typically short-duration, high-intensity types of exercise, such as squash and sprinting, that merely burn off sugar to fuel an active body. The most effective kinds of weight-losing exercise are walking briskly for at least 20 to 30 minutes, or cycling, jogging and swimming, all of which involve a less intensive workout, which means that you will be able to keep active for longer, thereby raising your metabolic rate and prompting your lungs and heart to deliver sufficient oxygen to your muscles to enable them to burn off fat. It will take at least six weeks before you notice any results. If you still can't resist embarking on a, say, pre-summer crash diet, take note of the following dangers and downsides before you do so. First, having seen hundreds of long-term dieters in my practice, I can attest to the fact that if you lose weight at a faster rate than 1kg a week on a sustained basis, something strange seems to happen to the metabolic rate (physiologists don't really understand why this happens). As soon as you start eating more than the 500 or 800 or so calories a day that you've been restricting yourself to in order to slim, not only do the pounds pile back on at great speed, but they do so in the form of fat, making any subsequent attempts to lose weight that much harder. Eating too little will also significantly reduce your energy levels, often to the extent that you won't be able to exercise at all because your body will have become so malnourished. You'll feel lousy and increasingly tetchy (dieters are notoriously avoided at the workplace), and your concentration will be compromised. Worse still, if you ingest fewer than 1,000 calories a day, eventually you may actually start hallucinating because your body begins to produce ketones, a form of emergency fuel the body produces when it's deprived of another energy source. Ketones also cause you to lose vital calcium from your bones, which can be particularly serious for people under the age of 20, when strength is still being built into the bones in preparation for the years ahead. Their bones may become so fragile that they end up developing osteoporosis (brittle-bone disease), either when they're still young or, in the case of some women, when they hit the menopause. Teenage girls may stop menstruating if they either lose too much weight or lose a lot rapidly, thereby triggering hormonal changes, and if menstruation is interrupted on a continuous basis, it will compromise not only bone health but also the ability to have children. Anaemia, too, is very common among teenagers who restrict their food intake in search of the so-called 'perfect' body. Crash-dieting usually involves reducing your intake of red meat, green, leafy vegetables and other iron-rich foods (and many teenagers would in any case prefer a slimming shake or bar, or a small portion of junk food, to a steak and salad, which would be far healthier for them), thereby causing the body to become deficient in this nutrient (and many others) which is essential for growth and development, as well as maintaining healthy blood and an effective immune system. My message, then, to all weight watchers is: stop pinning your hopes on dubious 'wonder' diets and start exercising regularly and eating small, well-balanced meals instead. Keep your intake of fat, sugar and alcohol low; eat plenty of vegetables, fruits, lean proteins, pulses and fibres; drink lots of water; eat slowly, and really savour your food. I have your best, long-term interests at heart, so believe me when I tell you that as much as I would love to trumpet the news that a new blood-type or psychological-profile diet works, I can't - they don't. Such diets are merely short-term solutions that have been primarily devised to line their promoters' wallets. Jane Clarke is a state-registered dietician.

      "body": "<p>Dinesh Dhamija knows a thing or two about terrifying descents. As European head of Royal Nepal Airlines a decade ago, he would jet in and out of Katmandu nearly once a fortnight. Planes landing at the airport need to negotiate a hairy, spiralling approach to the runway, and there have been several crashes. </p> <p>Perhaps this experience prepared him for Ebookers' cliff-like drop in stock market value, dragged down last year along with every other company bearing the dotcom suffix. Surely it's been a tumultuous year? </p> <p>'For dotcoms yes, but not for us,' he says curtly. So Ebookers is not really a dotcom? 'We come from the industry,' he explains. 'Our relations, contracts, and buying power are all in the travel industry.' </p> <p>Dhamija has been involved in this sector for more than 20 years. He started out in 1980, operating an agency from an 80-metre-square booth at Earl's Court Tube station. Three years later that venture grew into Flightbookers, which spun off its internet arm, ebookers.com, in 1999. </p> <p>Despite his protestations, the market has treated Ebookers as a dotcom. This suited the company when it shared in the upturn, after flotation on the Nasdaq and the German Neuer Markt 18 months ago. But when sentiment turned, Ebookers was not immune from the fortunes of the tumbling internet sector. </p> <p>But now, according to US research company Phocus-Wright, Ebookers is the No 1 online travel agent in Europe. The company has just listed on the London Stock Exchange, and is already trading 50 per cent above last month's issue price. </p> <p>'Our strategy is completely different from everyone else's. Our strategy is going into each country and buying content, which is negotiating fares, buying licences, buying people with language skills and local knowledge, and buying fulfilment - none of the others want to do that,' he says. </p> <p>Normally airlines sell directly to consumers at published fares - branded tickets that are rarely sold at a discount. Other passengers can get on the same flight more cheaply by purchasing a negotiated fare - a bargain-basement fare branded not by the airline, but by a travel agent. The agent can mix and match outward and return portions. </p> <p>Travel agents need to be licensed in each country in which they wish to sell negotiated fares, and need to develop direct relationships with airlines. 'The strategy is the most important thing - to buy the licences, you need one bricks-and-mortar agent in each country. There are only 10 to 15 agents per country who get negotiated fares.' </p> <p>Rather than set up anew in each European country he had targeted, Dhamija used the initial flotation proceeds to snap up 11 agencies with contacts and contracts in place. </p> <p>'We didn't buy just any company, only those with the licences. Lastminute started companies in six countries, which is of no use to man nor beast,' he argues. 'There's no way you're going to do it organically in this business; it has to be acquisition - you need critical size. To make a profit you need $250-350m in sales.' </p> <p>Dhamija was in a better position than most to pick off those valuable targets. 'I ran Royal Nepal right across Europe, and that's what gave me the contacts to go and buy those agents,' he says. </p> <p>So Ebookers has run an aggressive Cisco-esque acquisition strategy across Europe. It now has arrangements with some 120 airlines, and call centres with local expertise in 11 countries. Integrating these assets is difficult, but Dhamija believes this network is 'a huge barrier to entry for everyone else' - particularly US online agents. 'They won't have a chance,' he says. </p> <p>'They can't deal with languages and can't deal with 12 legal and audit systems. The European market is completely different.' Nor is Dhamija worried by the launch of websites by coalitions of airlines. 'The airlines' portals won't sell negotiated fares - it would wipe out their own brands.' </p> <p>Dhamija doesn't really see himself as part of the 'digerati'. 'Dapper travel industry grandee' would be a better description of this Cambridge law graduate, son of Indian diplomats. </p> <p>He fell into the travel industry by accident. 'It could well have been shoe-making,' he says. That booth at Earl's Court, operated with his wife and a friend, quickly turned into three booths, which by 1983 had become Flightbookers. </p> <p>Its entanglement with the internet in 1996 - the first travel agent with an interactive website - was 'pure fluke'. 'I had a friend who developed something in Germany. He said,\"Why don't you try it out?\" and at first I said, \"Don't waste my time\". Then he installed it free of charge and the bookings just started coming in.' </p> <p>Due to a lack of City enthusiasm for the internet, EBookers was not originally listed in London. But demand for shares in Germany and the US was strong; the original issue was 14 times oversubscribed. </p> <p>'It's a battle going public, it's pretty traumatic,' Dhamija says. 'We had 72 meetings in 12 days in eight countries during that November.' </p> <p>Now, having driven through most aspects of the original business plan, he is beginning to see its fruits. Ebookers' reported sales have beaten forecasts in every one of the six quarters since the original listing. Last week's figures showed an impressive doubling in year-on-year sales to $48.7m. Pre-tax losses for the quarter were $11.9m, but the company is on course to be cashflow-positive by the beginning of next year. </p> <p>The brightest piece of news was the near doubling in website visits year-on-year to 10.1m, whereas marketing costs have more than halved to $2.4m. </p> <p>These statistics are probably more important for long-term growth potential than sales growth. It suggests that brand recognition is strong. </p> <p>It also suggests that Ebookers' strategy of building a customer base offline through acquisition, then tempting them online, is beginning to work. Dhamija calls this strategy 'bricks and clicks'. </p> <p>'It's simple,' he says. 'For customer acquisition, the bricks method is much cheaper than the clicks method. You don't achieve this through advertising in newspapers or on radio, but by buying companies so those millions of sales are customers. </p> <p>'But to fulfil, the cheapest way is clicks. So you build people on the bricks path and then you give them a discount on the clicks path, which is an easy job - \u00a32 or something. So it is bricks and clicks, and not clicks and bricks - which is the Amazon model.' </p> <p>This turns the original internet orthodoxy on its head. Dhamija argues that it is more expensive to acquire customers over the internet, or through traditional advertising means, because they tend to be unprofitable,fickle, bargain-hunters. </p> <p>By building a critical mass of European customers, and steadily migrating them to his website through discounting, the scope for sustained revenue growth is greater. And the more customers Ebookers has, the greater its bargaining power with those 120 airlines. </p> <p>Dhamija is also looking at outsourcing some of his clerical and technology work to India, as part of a drive to halve cash burn to $1.5m a month. The strategy should lead to profits by 2002. </p> <p>'I won't be taking my foot off the pedal until we've made a profit,' he says. Having negotiated a tricky landing, Dhamija is now anxious to show that Ebookers can handle an equally difficult take-off. </p> <p>But he's used to that. </p> <p><strong>Profile</strong></p> <p><strong> Subject: </strong> Dinesh Dhamija </p> <p><strong> Born: </strong> Canberra, Australia </p> <p><strong> Job: </strong> Chief executive, EBookers </p> <p><strong> Education: </strong> Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge </p> <p><strong> Hobbies: </strong> Golf and travel</p>",

      "body": "<p>If the market is as keen on telecoms shares as the response to the \u00a33.5 billion placing by Vodafone suggests, Sir Christopher Bland should waste no time in launching British Telecom's rights issue. Far from grumbling at the issue - priced at just 6 per cent below the opening price on the day it was carried out - the City positively lapped it up. Indeed, so enthusiastic was the market that Vodafone upped the amount from the \u00a33bn originally planned. </p> <p>Alas for BT, this does not mean the City is no longer jittery about the level of telecoms debt and investment commitments. But it is realistic about what needs to be done. The spending spree which ended last summer has left too many telecoms companies with too much debt and too large a spending commitment to build their global networks. BT is merely the biggest British example of a distressed operator, but there are plenty of others around the globe. </p> <p>If there is to be any hope of a return on the investment made to date - never mind the spending to come - the networks have to be finished and the infrastructure assembled. The only sensible thing for investors to do, therefore, is to back those companies which seem to have the final headroom and the industrial clout to get that done. </p> <p>The City is betting that Vodafone is one of these. Doubling its stake in Japan Tele com makes strategic sense and, while some question its need to mop up BT's 17.8 per cent stake in Spanish Airtel given that it was already the majority shareholder, it does at least tidy up some loose ends. Vodafone could have financed the acquisitions with debt. On its own definitions, its borrowings at 31 March were around \u00a37bn. Add the debt in joint-venture companies - which Vodafone does not consolidate, but the debt agencies do - and that is approaching \u00a320bn. </p> <p>Without a placing, therefore, there was a high risk that it would have lost its triple-A rating, which would have had serious repercussions both for its rates and for its ability to raise funds in future. </p> <p>Japan Telecom alone needs as much as \u00a35bn to complete its network. Multiply that by at least 10 to get the interna tional figure, and the ability to tap the debt markets in future is clearly crucial. </p> <p>The placing should also ensure that Vodafone retains the flexibility to act should any other bargains appear. Vodafone's shares have all but halved in the past year as the investors began to grasp just how much investment the industry was gobbling up - and to fret about whether there would be the returns to justify it. </p> <p>Vodafone's placing provides some reassurance about its ability to finance its spending plans but it has yet to demonstrate it can make money from them. The shares are likely to remain volatile until there is evidence that the global telecoms dream can become a profitable reality. Cautious investors should steer clear. </p> <p><strong> Nothing to lose</strong><br> </p> <p> The problem with corporate restructuring is that, so often, it simply whets the appetite for more. David Thomas and his team at Whitbread may be feeling rather pleased with themselves for selling the group's brewing and pubs businesses in short order. Now, however, the City is wondering whether the restaurants deserve their place in the group. </p> <p>It is not hard to see why. Beefeater and Brewers Fayre were respectable but hardly spectacular. Up to 90 of the former will be rebranded as Out and Outs - lighter, modern and more upmarket, without the feeling of being part of a chain, says Whitbread - and other formats are being tried for the remaining 150 or so in the chain. </p> <p>Unfortunately, however, customers have a way of spotting chains very quickly - and avoiding them like the plague, as Whitbread has too often found to its cost. The result is a never-ending series of brand relaunches, which start with a bang but quickly become tired. </p> <p>That is clearly the problem with Caf\u00e9 Rouge and Bella Pasta, which only managed to maintain sales. Shedding the worst performers did give a fillip in the final quarter, when sales from ongoing sites were up 5 per cent. But Whitbread itself admits that they, along with TGI Fridays, may not manage to justify their position in the group long term - which requires a \u00a310 million annual contribution to profits. Costa Coffee - and that old banker, Pizza Hut - were the exceptions, producing healthy results. But how long can the caffe latte phenomenon last... </p> <p>Elsewhere, the results were solid enough. Conversion of the Swallow hotels (acquired last year) to Marriotts is proceeding well and producing the promised uplifts in revenue per room; the foot and mouth panic is showing signs of abating, judging by the most recent occupancy rates; and David Lloyd Leisure is still packing in the health fanatics. </p> <p>Later this month Whitbread is to return \u00a31.1bn, 230p a share, of the proceeds of the pubs and brewing sale to shareholders, so there is no point selling now. The shares have recovered, but are still at a big discount to the market, reflecting City scepticism about its ability to meet its own 10 per cent growth targets. Until there is more evidence, the shares are a hold. </p> <p><strong> Still no chemistry</strong><br> </p> <p> Imperial Chemical Industries is another much-restructured business. In the past five years it has sold and bought at a dizzying pace as it chased the holy grail of the chemicals industry: immunity from, or at least resilience within, the economic cycle. First-quarter results suggest it is succeeding slightly better than had been expected when it announced full-year figures three months ago. As it proudly boasts, only National Starch suffered from the US downturn and, even there, the performance was better than in the fourth quarter of last year. </p> <p>Quest, the fragrance and flavours business, and paints both shrugged off the downturn and reported an improvement on last year in the US. </p> <p>That is not bad, given the violent swings investors used to have to suffer when ICI was an old-fashioned chemicals business. But a flat trading profit is hardly something to get excited about, albeit that it is only a three-month period. The long-term targets of 4 to 5 per cent organic growth are not spectacular either - assuming they can even be achieved. The shares are a hold at best.</p>",

Alas for BT, this does not mean the City is no longer jittery about the level of telecoms debt and investment commitments. But it is realistic about what needs to be done. The spending spree which ended last summer has left too many telecoms companies with too much debt and too large a spending commitment to build their global networks. BT is merely the biggest British example of a distressed operator, but there are plenty of others around the globe. If there is to be any hope of a return on the investment made to date - never mind the spending to come - the networks have to be finished and the infrastructure assembled. The only sensible thing for investors to do, therefore, is to back those companies which seem to have the final headroom and the industrial clout to get that done. The City is betting that Vodafone is one of these. Doubling its stake in Japan Tele com makes strategic sense and, while some question its need to mop up BT's 17.8 per cent stake in Spanish Airtel given that it was already the majority shareholder, it does at least tidy up some loose ends. Vodafone could have financed the acquisitions with debt. On its own definitions, its borrowings at 31 March were around \u00a37bn. Add the debt in joint-venture companies - which Vodafone does not consolidate, but the debt agencies do - and that is approaching \u00a320bn. Without a placing, therefore, there was a high risk that it would have lost its triple-A rating, which would have had serious repercussions both for its rates and for its ability to raise funds in future. Japan Telecom alone needs as much as \u00a35bn to complete its network. Multiply that by at least 10 to get the interna tional figure, and the ability to tap the debt markets in future is clearly crucial. The placing should also ensure that Vodafone retains the flexibility to act should any other bargains appear. Vodafone's shares have all but halved in the past year as the investors began to grasp just how much investment the industry was gobbling up - and to fret about whether there would be the returns to justify it. Vodafone's placing provides some reassurance about its ability to finance its spending plans but it has yet to demonstrate it can make money from them. The shares are likely to remain volatile until there is evidence that the global telecoms dream can become a profitable reality. Cautious investors should steer clear. Nothing to lose The problem with corporate restructuring is that, so often, it simply whets the appetite for more. David Thomas and his team at Whitbread may be feeling rather pleased with themselves for selling the group's brewing and pubs businesses in short order. Now, however, the City is wondering whether the restaurants deserve their place in the group. It is not hard to see why. Beefeater and Brewers Fayre were respectable but hardly spectacular. Up to 90 of the former will be rebranded as Out and Outs - lighter, modern and more upmarket, without the feeling of being part of a chain, says Whitbread - and other formats are being tried for the remaining 150 or so in the chain. Unfortunately, however, customers have a way of spotting chains very quickly - and avoiding them like the plague, as Whitbread has too often found to its cost. The result is a never-ending series of brand relaunches, which start with a bang but quickly become tired. That is clearly the problem with Caf\u00e9 Rouge and Bella Pasta, which only managed to maintain sales. Shedding the worst performers did give a fillip in the final quarter, when sales from ongoing sites were up 5 per cent. But Whitbread itself admits that they, along with TGI Fridays, may not manage to justify their position in the group long term - which requires a \u00a310 million annual contribution to profits. Costa Coffee - and that old banker, Pizza Hut - were the exceptions, producing healthy results. But how long can the caffe latte phenomenon last... Elsewhere, the results were solid enough. Conversion of the Swallow hotels (acquired last year) to Marriotts is proceeding well and producing the promised uplifts in revenue per room; the foot and mouth panic is showing signs of abating, judging by the most recent occupancy rates; and David Lloyd Leisure is still packing in the health fanatics. Later this month Whitbread is to return \u00a31.1bn, 230p a share, of the proceeds of the pubs and brewing sale to shareholders, so there is no point selling now. The shares have recovered, but are still at a big discount to the market, reflecting City scepticism about its ability to meet its own 10 per cent growth targets. Until there is more evidence, the shares are a hold. Still no chemistry Imperial Chemical Industries is another much-restructured business. In the past five years it has sold and bought at a dizzying pace as it chased the holy grail of the chemicals industry: immunity from, or at least resilience within, the economic cycle. First-quarter results suggest it is succeeding slightly better than had been expected when it announced full-year figures three months ago. As it proudly boasts, only National Starch suffered from the US downturn and, even there, the performance was better than in the fourth quarter of last year. Quest, the fragrance and flavours business, and paints both shrugged off the downturn and reported an improvement on last year in the US. That is not bad, given the violent swings investors used to have to suffer when ICI was an old-fashioned chemicals business. But a flat trading profit is hardly something to get excited about, albeit that it is only a three-month period. The long-term targets of 4 to 5 per cent organic growth are not spectacular either - assuming they can even be achieved. The shares are a hold at best.",

      "body": "<p>Peace in heaven and glory in the highest; navel gazing has descended 12 inches. What are we looking at? We are looking at labial arteries, bulbospongiosus muscle and pudendal nerves. We are look ing at a collection of muscles and nerve-endings that are, or should be, responsible for those pleasurable contractions that lie at the centre of culture (or advertising, as it is now known) but whose exact physiological anatomy remains a mystery - to you, to me and to the medical profession. We are looking at the vulva, a place that has been explored and navigated and photographed but for which there is still no map. It is as if everyone has been driving around for ages and still has not found where they want to go. A bit like Birmingham.</p> <p>It was only three years ago that the Australian urologist Helen O'Connell discovered that the clitoris extended three-and-a-half inches into a woman's body, making it a far larger and more complex organ than it had been originally perceived. And it was also only three years ago that American sex therapist Laura Berman was told not to say clitoris on a British television programme.</p> <p>The clitoris - an organ designed purely for pleasure - has 8,000 nerve endings. But are we having fun yet? No we are not.</p> <p>The emergence of Viagra in 1998 turned the company Pfizer into a multimillion- pound organisation. The success of the drug not only revealed the extent of male impotence (or erectile dysfunction, as it is more politely described), but more importantly it made the subject less embarrassing. In 1999, the Journal of the American Medical Association reported a survey which showed that while one in 10 men were experiencing sexual problems, the numbers went up to four in 10 in women. Forty-three per cent.</p> <p>Sex-sated culture still deifies the female body as a lifeless mammarian goddess, but the woman inside that body is reporting record levels of sexual disinterest. Libidos are low, orgasms are not forthcoming and the consequence is physical pain, emotional distress and insoluble relationship problems. These 'disorders' are now medically termed as FSD - female sexual dysfunction.</p> <p>No, we are not having fun yet.</p> <p>Welcome to the University of Los Angeles Medical Centre. I wait for the Berman sisters in the Elmer Belt Conference Room at the Centre for Urology in Westwood. There are black-and-white photographs of various 'fathers of urology'. There is the magazine of the American Urology Association whose front page leads on stories about 'androgen deficiency in the ageing male' and the forthcoming meeting of the Society for the Study of Impotence. And, on the wall, a framed cystoscope - a terrifying appliance that looks like a cross between a clarinet and a cake icer. Lord knows where it is supposed to go. Not anywhere near me, I hope.</p> <p>This is a manly atmosphere, but urology, until now, has been a manly concern. Indeed, one of the reasons why the American Food and Drug Administration is loath to sanction the sale of Viagra to women (despite much demand) is because there has been so little scientific research into the physiology of female genitalia.</p> <p>The siblings arrive. They are attractive, blonde and smiley, and this is good because it means they won't scare the straights. They are enjoying something of a success in America, partly, perhaps, because they are blonde and smiley, nice Jewish girls from the Upper East Side, partly because they are well-qualified, and partly because they are in the right place at the right time.The zeitgeist is on their side.</p> <p>There has been publicity. The Bermans understand publicity and they are good at it (appearing on Oprah and various chat shows with nerveless aplomb), knowing, no doubt, that increased awareness of their work not only eases the path towards helpful grants, but also creates a more relaxed atmosphere around the discussion of 'wimmin's parts'.</p> <p>Laura, 32, is a sex therapist. Jennifer, 36, is a surgeon who decided to specialise in urology because she enjoyed the procedures (which, in general, offer a high rate of recovery for acute conditions), because it offered a lifestyle that allowed her to be a mother (she has a 16-month-old son) and because, as a field of research, it offered the potential for discovery. While working in residency in Maryland, she found that the path to reconstructive surgery of the female pelvic floor was hampered by a lack of knowledge about nerve endings - that is, the relationship between the spinal cord, the uterus, the vagina and the clitoris was still unknown - which explains why so many women who have had pelvic surgery and hysterectomies are suffering from desensitisation.</p> <p>Jennifer is fascinated by the mechanics of female sexual response; she provides the clinical perspective, while her sister investigates the emotional roots of the problem. And, since they believe that most disorders are the result of both, they are uniquely positioned to provide a realistic picture and to advise on suitable treatment. Laura is perky in a blue jumper; Jennifer is ER in a white coat.</p> <p>Jennifer is happily married to Greg, a public-health specialist. Laura is divorced with a four-year-old son. 'My ex-husband had self-esteem problems. My intellect and success made him feel inferior. Eventually I left the marriage,' she explains.</p> <p>Both Bermans are small and neat, though Laura insists that Jennifer has body-image problems. 'I'm not a big dieter,' she says, 'but if I spend too much time with Jennifer I start to get psycho with, \"Am I fat?\" and, \"How does my butt look?\"'</p> <p>Jennifer pinches her younger sister. 'She is very self-conscious about her arms.'</p> <p>Laura: 'We got fat in college.'</p> <p>Jennifer: 'Our mother was very buff... remember, we used to have to hide when we ate cream cheese?'</p> <p>Laura: 'It wasn't cream cheese. We used to sneak down and eat ice-cream sundaes.'</p> <p>Jennifer: 'And there was the chocolate she hid in the freezer.'</p> <p>This cues wild laughing, and I observe that their fa\u00e7ade of sanity is obviously a grotesque illusion to which there is more wild laughing followed by the general agreement that mothers pass on to their daughters how they feel about their bodies.</p> <p>'I guess the bottom line is that we are women and we understand what women go through,' says Laura.</p> <p>They began life in Park Avenue, New York, but moved as teenagers to Georgia, where their father, a colon-rectal surgeon, ran his practice. Their mother had surrendered her career in finance to raise her family.</p> <p>Jennifer: 'That sort of impacted on Laura and me in terms of a career passage.'</p> <p>Laura: 'She wanted us to be emotionally and financially independent. She used to put me to bed making me promise to be president.'</p> <p>Jennifer: 'That didn't work, so now our sons are going to be presidents.'</p> <p>As a teenager, Jennifer began to read Judy Blume, an American author specialising in novels for adolescents about the progress from childhood to sexuality, which described both masturbation and orgasm. Her father found Forever and ripped the book in half.</p> <p>Laura: 'He didn't do that for me!'</p> <p>Jennifer: 'He probably didn't know you were reading it.'</p> <p>Laura: 'He did! Mom knew I was reading it. I remember we were in the dentist's office and this mother got mad at her for letting me read it and she said, \"As long as she reads, I don't care what she reads...\"'</p> <p>Sex, in the Berman household, was discussed openly, but the overriding message was that they should avoid it if possible. Laura: 'From early on, there was the message that we should not be sexual until we were in the context of a healthy, loving relationship.'</p> <p>Jennifer: 'They did not encourage us to go out and sexually experiment at all.'</p> <p>Laura: 'There are two components - one is about feeling at ease with your sexuality and the other is acting on it by putting yourself at risk of pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. These were very separate issues in our house, and I still think that in order to be sexually responsible you need to first feel good about yourself and your sexuality, and I think they are responsible for that.'</p> <p>It quickly became apparent that Jennifer was going to become the doctor; Laura could not stand the sight of blood, while Jennifer took to medicating her horse. Jennifer's research into subjects such as nitric oxide takes her to places that make her sister shudder - working on cadavers, for instance, in order to study the female genitalia. I ask her about her reaction to her first dead body.</p> <p>Jennifer: 'It was Uncle Ed. He was in an open casket.'</p> <p>Laura: 'The only thing I remember about Uncle Ed is the thumb wrestling.'</p> <p>Laura trained to be a sex therapist at the New York University Medical Centre. 'I was exposed to everything under the sun,' she says. 'I talked to peep-show workers and prostitutes. I went to gay bars and S&amp;M meetings. I had to confront every value I had, question it, analyse it and understand it. I found working with sex offenders very hard. And some of the paraphilias. One woman had an antenna fetish, I remember. She was a radio-repair woman. My threshold for shock was a lot higher than some of my colleagues, but now I am never shocked.'</p> <p>She moved to Spain with her husband and worked as a sex therapist there until her marriage broke down, leaving her with no immediate prospects. Jennifer, meanwhile, had taken a job in Boston and invited her to work with her. They founded a clinic for women's sexual health in 1998, then moved to California last year. Now they run two clinics a week and see around 40 new patients a month. The average age is 45, but there have been 18- and 80-year-olds. The women come from all over America (and the world) and, though predominately heterosexual, they represent a diverse ethnic spectrum.</p> <p>The sisters have outlined the categories that define female sexual dysfunction in their book For Women Only. It falls into four parts. One of these is hypoactive sexual-desire disorder, the symptom of which is a basic lack of interest. The causes can be various - anti-depressants, for instance, are known to lower the libido. They may also be emotional in their base, or the physical result of menopause, which can cause dryness. Sexual-arousal disorder, meanwhile, is characterised by the physical inability to maintain lubrication, by decreased sensation and, sometimes, by diminished blood flow to the vagina or clitoris. Orgasmic disorder is the inability to reach climax despite stimulation. This can be caused by a number of things including trauma (such as sexual abuse or a physical accident), hormonal deficiency or damage incurred during pelvic surgery. Finally, sexual-pain disorder is intense discomfort experienced during penetrative sex. It may have its origins in emotional causes, in surgical procedures or, again, in the onset of menopause.</p> <p>Treatments vary and many of them are still in experimental stages. The Bermans have participated in clinical trials for Viagra and remain enthusiastic about its prospects, despite some disappointing statistics. They also believe that testosterone is important in governing libido and sexual response.</p> <p>Some women arrive with their partners; some do not. Who are they? They are Janet, 35, mother of two from Boston who, having been sexually abused by her brother at the age of seven, could only reach orgasm by self-stimulation. When it came to her husband (whom she loved) she shut down. Her husband was talking about divorce. 'Shutting down', say the Berman sisters, is a common 'survival' response. Viagra did not work for Janet. Therapy and anti-depressants did.</p> <p>Debra, 31, and her husband Scott, a couple from New York, had four children and were experiencing a common problem - unequal libidos. Debra was exhausted; Scott wanted sex. We all know the scenario. A lowering of the female libido is particularly common after the birth of a second child. Debra had put on weight and felt ashamed of her body. The Bermans encouraged Scott to stimulate his wife with a vibrator (she had never masturbated). They observed healthy pelvic blood flow, engorgement and lubrication. They tested her blood for lowered testosterone levels, a common cause of lowered libido. Testosterone can be prescribed as a solution, but some women avoid it, not wanting to take a hormone about which relatively little is known. Debra, however, was found to have normal levels. The Bermans suggested that the couple take time away from the children in order to focus on each other, and referred them to a therapist. They also prescribed a low-dose testosterone cream and Viagra. The couple began to make progress.</p> <p>Carla, 44, a mother of three, had under gone uterine-artery embolisation - a surgical procedure for the treatment of fibroids, during which plastic particles are injected into the uterine artery in order to block blood flow to the fibroids. The result was that having enjoyed satisfying orgasms, Carla had lost her ability to achieve a satisfying climax.</p> <p>The Bermans concluded that the surgery had affected the vaginal arteries and, consequently, the blood flow to her pelvis. They recommended aerobic exercise. Carla's condition improved. She is now executive director of the National Uterine Fibroid Foundation.</p> <p>The solutions are not always so simple. Ann and Charles were in their seventies. They had grown apart within their marriage, but Charles wanted to restore the intimacy that they had lost. Ann, post-menopausal, had lost interest in sex. She was also angry with her husband, who had engaged in a number of extra-marital affairs. She did not want to undergo a physical examination nor did she want to take hormones. Nor, however, did she wish to live alone. The Bermans told them that couple therapy would help them work through the anger that fulminated at the centre of the relationship; but the couple remained in limbo, unable to make a decision as to which direction to go. Change is frightening and, at 70, very difficult.</p> <p>The patient who presents herself to the Centre for Pelvic Medicine is a brave woman.

Why haven't women received the same attention? To understand the present we have to consider the past. Little is known about sexual behaviour in ancient times, but from the time of earliest recorded history, about 3,000BC, women were considered as property, valued only for reproduction. Adultery was not only a sin but a trespass against a husband. In ancient Greece, a woman was simply called 'gyne', which meant 'bearer of children'. While the Greeks viewed women as chattels and the Romans considered infertility as grounds for divorce, the Christian church after the fall of Rome went even further. The church fathers deemed sex unsavoury and women a threat to male salvation. Nothing, said St Augustine, brought 'the manly mind down from the heights more than a woman's caresses and that joining of bodies'. Procreation with such 'temptresses' was to be accomplished by passionless, purposeful intercourse.</p> <p>Even as late as the 19th century, women were expected to embrace modesty, personify purity, and lack all sexual desire. The Victorian era transformed the middle-class housewife into no less than a guardian of the public morality. Her place was at home with her children, protecting the family's decency and social position. She endured sex with her husband for procreation, but if her husband was a decent soul he subjected her to his animal urges as infrequently as possible.</p> <p>Many women readily accepted the view that they were without sexual needs. At the same time, 'hysteria' was apparently pandemic. If the disease was in fact chronic sexual frustration, as Rachel P Maines argues in her book The Technology of Orgasm , an entertaining but serious history of the vibrator, women sought relief through one of the more acceptable outlets: going to the doctor's for their orgasms. Maines writes that Western doctors performed the 'routine chore' of relieving hysterical patients' symptoms with manual genital massage until a woman reached orgasm, or, as it was known under clinical conditions, the 'hysterical paroxysm'. The vibrator, invented by a British physician in the 1880s, was a direct response to doctors who wanted help performing this procedure.</p> <p>There is also evidence that not all19th-century middle-class women were as Victorian behind closed doors as in public. The cultural historian Peter Gay, for example, has quoted extensively in his work from the diary of Mabel Loomis Todd, a New Englander who revelled in the eroticism of her marriage to her husband. 'We retired at seven and had a magnificent evening,' Mabel Todd wrote in her diary in February 1882. 'I shall never forget it, so I'll not write about it.' The entry was followed by two symbols indicating the couple had intercourse twice that night.</p> <p>But Mabel Todd was probably the exception. Most Victorian women repressed their sexuality to such a degree that most men and some women viewed prostitution as a necessary evil that allowed the male a natural outlet for his lust. By early in the next century Sigmund Freud was questioning almost every aspect of sex. His ideas were revolutionary and had an enormous impact on attitudes in that they promoted sexual desire. However, in a view which still permeates our culture, he also believed that clitoral orgasms were immature and that vaginal orgasms were 'authentic'.</p> <p>Writing at the same time as Freud was Havelock Ellis, an English doctor who is less well known but who had a far more positive impact on women's attitudes to sex. Sometimes called the prophet of modern sexuality, he believed that women had strong erotic needs. He also believed that the emphasis on sex as a means of reproduction was a repressive influence on female sexuality. Freud, he once said, 'was an extravagant genius - the greatest figure in psychology who was almost always wrong.'</p> <p>The 20th century saw radical research by the likes of Alfred Kinsey's Sexual Behaviour in the Human Male and Sexual Behaviour in the Human Female in which Americans were asked to talk frankly about masturbation, premarital sex, extramarital sex and homosexuality. If the findings from men shocked traditionalists - more than a third of adult men said they had had a homosexual experience, for instance - few Americans were ready to hear the news that women were as capable of orgasm as men.</p> <p>Fifty years on the opposite seems to be true. Women have the pressure of being drawn into sex much earlier in a relationship, with expectations from men that they should be sexual adventurers, or at the very least multi-orgasmic. 'Placed on the defensive, they were rapidly losing the right to say no that 19th-century feminists had struggled to obtain,' write John D'Emilio and Estelle B Freedman in Intimate Matters: a History of Sexuality in America .</p> <p>And yet we are optimistic. When Bob Dole discussed erectile dysfunction - his own, in particular - on television, men as well as women realised their sexual 'problems' were nothing to be ashamed of. Although we can't yet say that the field of women's sexual health is about to catch up with men's, we can say that women are increasingly deciding that they need the same treatment as men.

      "bodyText": "Peace in heaven and glory in the highest; navel gazing has descended 12 inches. What are we looking at? We are looking at labial arteries, bulbospongiosus muscle and pudendal nerves. We are look ing at a collection of muscles and nerve-endings that are, or should be, responsible for those pleasurable contractions that lie at the centre of culture (or advertising, as it is now known) but whose exact physiological anatomy remains a mystery - to you, to me and to the medical profession. We are looking at the vulva, a place that has been explored and navigated and photographed but for which there is still no map. It is as if everyone has been driving around for ages and still has not found where they want to go. A bit like Birmingham. It was only three years ago that the Australian urologist Helen O'Connell discovered that the clitoris extended three-and-a-half inches into a woman's body, making it a far larger and more complex organ than it had been originally perceived. And it was also only three years ago that American sex therapist Laura Berman was told not to say clitoris on a British television programme. The clitoris - an organ designed purely for pleasure - has 8,000 nerve endings. But are we having fun yet? No we are not. The emergence of Viagra in 1998 turned the company Pfizer into a multimillion- pound organisation. The success of the drug not only revealed the extent of male impotence (or erectile dysfunction, as it is more politely described), but more importantly it made the subject less embarrassing. In 1999, the Journal of the American Medical Association reported a survey which showed that while one in 10 men were experiencing sexual problems, the numbers went up to four in 10 in women. Forty-three per cent. Sex-sated culture still deifies the female body as a lifeless mammarian goddess, but the woman inside that body is reporting record levels of sexual disinterest. Libidos are low, orgasms are not forthcoming and the consequence is physical pain, emotional distress and insoluble relationship problems. These 'disorders' are now medically termed as FSD - female sexual dysfunction. No, we are not having fun yet. Welcome to the University of Los Angeles Medical Centre. I wait for the Berman sisters in the Elmer Belt Conference Room at the Centre for Urology in Westwood. There are black-and-white photographs of various 'fathers of urology'. There is the magazine of the American Urology Association whose front page leads on stories about 'androgen deficiency in the ageing male' and the forthcoming meeting of the Society for the Study of Impotence. And, on the wall, a framed cystoscope - a terrifying appliance that looks like a cross between a clarinet and a cake icer. Lord knows where it is supposed to go. Not anywhere near me, I hope. This is a manly atmosphere, but urology, until now, has been a manly concern. Indeed, one of the reasons why the American Food and Drug Administration is loath to sanction the sale of Viagra to women (despite much demand) is because there has been so little scientific research into the physiology of female genitalia. The siblings arrive. They are attractive, blonde and smiley, and this is good because it means they won't scare the straights. They are enjoying something of a success in America, partly, perhaps, because they are blonde and smiley, nice Jewish girls from the Upper East Side, partly because they are well-qualified, and partly because they are in the right place at the right time.The zeitgeist is on their side. There has been publicity. The Bermans understand publicity and they are good at it (appearing on Oprah and various chat shows with nerveless aplomb), knowing, no doubt, that increased awareness of their work not only eases the path towards helpful grants, but also creates a more relaxed atmosphere around the discussion of 'wimmin's parts'. Laura, 32, is a sex therapist. Jennifer, 36, is a surgeon who decided to specialise in urology because she enjoyed the procedures (which, in general, offer a high rate of recovery for acute conditions), because it offered a lifestyle that allowed her to be a mother (she has a 16-month-old son) and because, as a field of research, it offered the potential for discovery. While working in residency in Maryland, she found that the path to reconstructive surgery of the female pelvic floor was hampered by a lack of knowledge about nerve endings - that is, the relationship between the spinal cord, the uterus, the vagina and the clitoris was still unknown - which explains why so many women who have had pelvic surgery and hysterectomies are suffering from desensitisation. Jennifer is fascinated by the mechanics of female sexual response; she provides the clinical perspective, while her sister investigates the emotional roots of the problem. And, since they believe that most disorders are the result of both, they are uniquely positioned to provide a realistic picture and to advise on suitable treatment. Laura is perky in a blue jumper; Jennifer is ER in a white coat. Jennifer is happily married to Greg, a public-health specialist. Laura is divorced with a four-year-old son. 'My ex-husband had self-esteem problems. My intellect and success made him feel inferior. Eventually I left the marriage,' she explains. Both Bermans are small and neat, though Laura insists that Jennifer has body-image problems. 'I'm not a big dieter,' she says, 'but if I spend too much time with Jennifer I start to get psycho with, \"Am I fat?\" and, \"How does my butt look?\"' Jennifer pinches her younger sister. 'She is very self-conscious about her arms.' Laura: 'We got fat in college.' Jennifer: 'Our mother was very buff... remember, we used to have to hide when we ate cream cheese?' Laura: 'It wasn't cream cheese. We used to sneak down and eat ice-cream sundaes.' Jennifer: 'And there was the chocolate she hid in the freezer.' This cues wild laughing, and I observe that their fa\u00e7ade of sanity is obviously a grotesque illusion to which there is more wild laughing followed by the general agreement that mothers pass on to their daughters how they feel about their bodies. 'I guess the bottom line is that we are women and we understand what women go through,' says Laura. They began life in Park Avenue, New York, but moved as teenagers to Georgia, where their father, a colon-rectal surgeon, ran his practice. Their mother had surrendered her career in finance to raise her family. Jennifer: 'That sort of impacted on Laura and me in terms of a career passage.' Laura: 'She wanted us to be emotionally and financially independent. She used to put me to bed making me promise to be president.' Jennifer: 'That didn't work, so now our sons are going to be presidents.' As a teenager, Jennifer began to read Judy Blume, an American author specialising in novels for adolescents about the progress from childhood to sexuality, which described both masturbation and orgasm. Her father found Forever and ripped the book in half. Laura: 'He didn't do that for me!' Jennifer: 'He probably didn't know you were reading it.' Laura: 'He did! Mom knew I was reading it. I remember we were in the dentist's office and this mother got mad at her for letting me read it and she said, \"As long as she reads, I don't care what she reads...\"' Sex, in the Berman household, was discussed openly, but the overriding message was that they should avoid it if possible. Laura: 'From early on, there was the message that we should not be sexual until we were in the context of a healthy, loving relationship.' Jennifer: 'They did not encourage us to go out and sexually experiment at all.' Laura: 'There are two components - one is about feeling at ease with your sexuality and the other is acting on it by putting yourself at risk of pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. These were very separate issues in our house, and I still think that in order to be sexually responsible you need to first feel good about yourself and your sexuality, and I think they are responsible for that.' It quickly became apparent that Jennifer was going to become the doctor; Laura could not stand the sight of blood, while Jennifer took to medicating her horse. Jennifer's research into subjects such as nitric oxide takes her to places that make her sister shudder - working on cadavers, for instance, in order to study the female genitalia. I ask her about her reaction to her first dead body. Jennifer: 'It was Uncle Ed. He was in an open casket.' Laura: 'The only thing I remember about Uncle Ed is the thumb wrestling.' Laura trained to be a sex therapist at the New York University Medical Centre. 'I was exposed to everything under the sun,' she says. 'I talked to peep-show workers and prostitutes. I went to gay bars and S&amp;M meetings. I had to confront every value I had, question it, analyse it and understand it. I found working with sex offenders very hard. And some of the paraphilias. One woman had an antenna fetish, I remember. She was a radio-repair woman. My threshold for shock was a lot higher than some of my colleagues, but now I am never shocked.' She moved to Spain with her husband and worked as a sex therapist there until her marriage broke down, leaving her with no immediate prospects. Jennifer, meanwhile, had taken a job in Boston and invited her to work with her. They founded a clinic for women's sexual health in 1998, then moved to California last year. Now they run two clinics a week and see around 40 new patients a month. The average age is 45, but there have been 18- and 80-year-olds. The women come from all over America (and the world) and, though predominately heterosexual, they represent a diverse ethnic spectrum. The sisters have outlined the categories that define female sexual dysfunction in their book For Women Only. It falls into four parts. One of these is hypoactive sexual-desire disorder, the symptom of which is a basic lack of interest. The causes can be various - anti-depressants, for instance, are known to lower the libido. They may also be emotional in their base, or the physical result of menopause, which can cause dryness. Sexual-arousal disorder, meanwhile, is characterised by the physical inability to maintain lubrication, by decreased sensation and, sometimes, by diminished blood flow to the vagina or clitoris. Orgasmic disorder is the inability to reach climax despite stimulation. This can be caused by a number of things including trauma (such as sexual abuse or a physical accident), hormonal deficiency or damage incurred during pelvic surgery. Finally, sexual-pain disorder is intense discomfort experienced during penetrative sex. It may have its origins in emotional causes, in surgical procedures or, again, in the onset of menopause. Treatments vary and many of them are still in experimental stages. The Bermans have participated in clinical trials for Viagra and remain enthusiastic about its prospects, despite some disappointing statistics. They also believe that testosterone is important in governing libido and sexual response. Some women arrive with their partners; some do not. Who are they? They are Janet, 35, mother of two from Boston who, having been sexually abused by her brother at the age of seven, could only reach orgasm by self-stimulation. When it came to her husband (whom she loved) she shut down. Her husband was talking about divorce. 'Shutting down', say the Berman sisters, is a common 'survival' response. Viagra did not work for Janet. Therapy and anti-depressants did. Debra, 31, and her husband Scott, a couple from New York, had four children and were experiencing a common problem - unequal libidos. Debra was exhausted; Scott wanted sex. We all know the scenario. A lowering of the female libido is particularly common after the birth of a second child. Debra had put on weight and felt ashamed of her body. The Bermans encouraged Scott to stimulate his wife with a vibrator (she had never masturbated). They observed healthy pelvic blood flow, engorgement and lubrication. They tested her blood for lowered testosterone levels, a common cause of lowered libido. Testosterone can be prescribed as a solution, but some women avoid it, not wanting to take a hormone about which relatively little is known. Debra, however, was found to have normal levels. The Bermans suggested that the couple take time away from the children in order to focus on each other, and referred them to a therapist. They also prescribed a low-dose testosterone cream and Viagra. The couple began to make progress. Carla, 44, a mother of three, had under gone uterine-artery embolisation - a surgical procedure for the treatment of fibroids, during which plastic particles are injected into the uterine artery in order to block blood flow to the fibroids. The result was that having enjoyed satisfying orgasms, Carla had lost her ability to achieve a satisfying climax. The Bermans concluded that the surgery had affected the vaginal arteries and, consequently, the blood flow to her pelvis. They recommended aerobic exercise. Carla's condition improved. She is now executive director of the National Uterine Fibroid Foundation. The solutions are not always so simple. Ann and Charles were in their seventies. They had grown apart within their marriage, but Charles wanted to restore the intimacy that they had lost. Ann, post-menopausal, had lost interest in sex. She was also angry with her husband, who had engaged in a number of extra-marital affairs. She did not want to undergo a physical examination nor did she want to take hormones. Nor, however, did she wish to live alone. The Bermans told them that couple therapy would help them work through the anger that fulminated at the centre of the relationship; but the couple remained in limbo, unable to make a decision as to which direction to go. Change is frightening and, at 70, very difficult. The patient who presents herself to the Centre for Pelvic Medicine is a brave woman. She must be ready to discuss the most intimate details of her sex life with Laura, whose questions will be about everything from masturbation to the possibility of sexual abuse suffered in childhood. Then there is a range of tests conducted by Jennifer. Her equipment is designed to assess PH levels, vaginal elasticity, clitoral sensation and pelvic blood flow, but it looks as if it has been stolen from the set of Dead Ringers. The EROS CTD (clitoral therapy device) is a battery-operated vacuum designed to increase the blood flow to the clitoris by sucking on it with a 'CARess Cup'. The TSA 11 NeuroSensory Analyser was developed to research the effect of neurological disorders (such as multiple sclerosis) on the female genital organs. It is a black probe attached to various wires and clamps, described by the manufacturers as an 'intra-vaginal vibratory insertion unit'. Jennifer admits that, yes, they do make women nervous, but then the women are also keen to find the root of their problems. The 3D 'surround-around' video glasses are more fun in a sci-fi kind of way. They are fitted with an erotic video, the patient self-stimulates with a vibrator, and the post-orgasmic effects are assessed by a vaginal probe and ultrasound, in order to compare them against the data gathered in the initial tests. This brings us, not unnaturally, to the subject of pornography. In many ways, the Berman sisters are the logical follow-up to the thinking initiated by women such as Annie Sprinkle and Nina Hartley 10 years ago. Sprinkle, a New York performance artist, gave shows in which members of the audience were encouraged to look at her cervix with the aid of a torch and a speculum. Hartley, a porn star, made 'instructional' videos. Both represented the pro-porn feminist idea that it was important for women to take control of their sexuality, enjoy it and, as a result, undermine the macho phallocentricity that dominated it. Laura Berman is aware of and likes the work of both these performers and appreciates what they have achieved. Now she is in the ironic position of helping to legitimise porn by providing erotica for women in a clinical/experimental setting, where the environment is official and formal rather than low-rent and sleazy. She is hampered somewhat, not only by the complexity of an individual's arousal (the female erotic imagination knows few limits), but by the paucity of suitable material. 'It does not matter to us what turns them on,' says Laura. 'Only whether they are conflicted by it. Who am I to tell a woman how to express herself? The only issue I have is that most men get their primary sex education from porn films which are geared to men and do not necessarily reflect what women want. So, unless he is with a woman who is able to educate him, he could be with 300 women and never know.' In America, the Berman sisters are seen as representing the next stage of the feminist movement, a movement that has been somewhat stagnant of late, impeded as it is by dull old ideas that are unable to counteract the commercial power of regressive imagery. The battalion of Bridget Jones clones marches forward. They want to be married. They want to be thin. They do not want to think. Detractors may observe that to emphasise female sexuality is to conform to male thinking - that is, a woman must have sex in order to be happy and there is something wrong with her if she does not. And it could easily be argued that our expectations are far, far too high. There are other things to do, after all - gardening, singing, art... History tells us that women who have avoided domestic ideals are the ones that have contributed the most to the currency of ideas. Nevertheless, the ability to have an orgasm is fundamental. Laura Berman believes that sex can reduce stress, enhance mood and increase self-esteem. 'Sexuality is a central part of who we are,' she says. The physical reality is that the more sexually active a woman is, the better the blood flow to her genitals, which means less risk of vaginal atrophy. Then there is the sociological point that says in a time of high divorce rate (and its consequences) there is good reason to encourage happy sexual relations. Sex is cited again and again as a root cause of marital and relationship breakdowns; improve on these problems and you contribute to a healthier picture of society. 'There are medical, emotional and relational causes for sexual function complaints,' Laura continues. 'These can be attended to to help women have more fulfilling sex lives.' The Bermans are coming to London this month to publicise their book. They are looking forward to it. 'Is there riding? asks Jennifer, perking up. 'You can go round and round a public park if you like,' I reply. The interview is at an end. I leave them arguing about who has lost the vibrators. 'I thought you had them!' 'No, you have.' 'I'm sure they were with you.' 'No, they weren't...' For women only: The Bermans on the history of sex Why does the field of women's sexual health lag 30 years behind that of men?

      "body": "<p>Victoria Street, London, W1 - also known as New Labour's road to Damascus. At the Westminster end of this thoroughfare stands the Department of Trade and Industry's steel and glass headquarters, a building witness to some of the most striking of Labour's political conversions. </p> <p>Here we have consumer affairs minister Kim Howells, battling daily to smash cartels and ensure consumers are protected by a fully functioning open market. Howells was, of course, a lefty firebrand who spent the Eighties mixing it with the miners in Wales against Thatcherite market reforms. </p> <p>Here is Alan Johnson, minister in charge of the (commercialised) Post Office, now called Consignia. Johnson was the brains behind the defeat of Conservative plans to make the organisation more - well - commercial. </p> <p>And, recently arrived, here is Peter Hain, formerly of the Labour left and CND, now minister for energy and competitiveness in Europe, among the most dapper of Tony Blair's lieutenants, and among the most eager to preach the importance of business and competition. So is Hain a true convert?. </p> <p>When he was appointed in January, not everyone was convinced. One minute Hain was swanning around the world as a junior minister in the Foreign Office; the next he was thinking about new electricity trading arrangements (Neta) and the escalating price of gas. MPs still whisper that Hain is less than chuffed. </p> <p>But, for the record, he's having none of that. Hain clearly believes he has an important role to play, converting what has often been a technical and sensitive job (dealing with the decline of coal mining, for example) into one where political points can be scored. </p> <p>'He [Blair] said to me \"I want you back in domestic politics, and there are four or five issues that are proving really troublesome\",' he says. </p> <p>'I have always thought that industry and economics was what made the world tick,' continues the former anti-Apartheid radical. 'Although it matters to UK plc whether I form good relations with Malawi, it is certainly important to the economy and to domestic politics whether we get Neta right.' </p> <p>He is keen to promote controversial areas of policy - taking on oil and gas giants for example - in order to gain credit for dealing with them. And his frequent references to 'his master' suggest that if he isn't taking his lead from Number 10, he wants to be seen to be doing so. </p> <p>Top of the list is the wholesale price of gas, which rose from 12p a therm in 1999 to a 27p peak a year later, falling back to a current 24p, causing great difficulties for big industrial, commercial and even domestic users. </p> <p>Officials at the DTI are unsure of the exact reasons, which is why the European Commission is currently investigating. </p> <p>The Commission is focusing on the gas interconnector between the UK and Europe, which has effectively sucked lower-price UK gas through to Europe where prices are higher, and sucked European prices back to the UK. </p> <p>EC and UK officials suspect that access to the interconnector may not be as open as it should be. It is owned by some of the larger oil and gas operators and there is suspicion of manipulation. </p> <p>On top of this, there is concern that some North Sea operators may be manipulating the supply of gas that is fed into the UK. </p> <p>Hain is not convinced that the big players are playing fair. 'I have asked them to do their best to make sure there are no anti-competitive practices going on. I am not satisfied that, for at least a proportion of the market, that is not happening,' he says. </p> <p>He believes more transparency is needed, so it is clear how much gas is available, where it is, where it is shipped to, and when it goes into the UK system. Regulator Ofgem is reviewing some of these issues. </p> <p>However, he adds that, notwithstanding the EC investigation, 'I would not rule out some other action being taken to the Office [of Fair Trading].' </p> <p>Hain's enthusiasm to see markets working properly has a similar political and opportunistic feel to his colleague Kim Howells' 'rip-off Britain' campaign. In this case ensuring that lower wholesale gas prices help not only companies such as paper millers, and glass and cement manufacturers, but domestic customers, particularly those of independent gas suppliers, who have seen bills rise by up to 6 per cent. </p> <p>Hain believes Neta, which replaces the discredited wholesale electricity pool, will deliver lower electricity bills to customers by matching demand more accurately with supply, and will also help correct swings in wholesale energy prices. Hain is also keen to step back from Neta, and to look strategically at the UK's energy needs. </p> <p>The political top line after Tony Blair's recent environmental speeches is to talk up renewable energy. 'I want to be seen as the champion of the renewables sector. I don't think we have been doing enough as a Government on it.' </p> <p>Hain ensured the Government received credit for the 18 offshore wind farms, designed to deliver 1000MW of power, announced last month. He says he wants to see renewable energy going well above the 10 per cent of UK generation that has been set as a target by 2010. </p> <p>He points to new technologies such as offshore wind, energy from waste, and to \u00a3250m earmarked by the Government to make it happen. Last week he announced \u00a33m for solar housing projects and urged power giants to encourage the uptake of solar power. And, ever in search of the politically painless way out, he cites this target to blunt the impact of the lobbying campaign by the nuclear industry to build new nuclear power stations. </p> <p>Hain says the future of Britain's energy supply is likely to be the subject of a wholesale review after the election, if Labour wins it. He is sceptical about new nuclear stations. 'I would be very surprised if there was an application [to build], because the economics are not there,' he says. </p> <p>'What I don't want is an energy policy that becomes only gas and nuclear.

      "bodyText": "Victoria Street, London, W1 - also known as New Labour's road to Damascus. At the Westminster end of this thoroughfare stands the Department of Trade and Industry's steel and glass headquarters, a building witness to some of the most striking of Labour's political conversions. Here we have consumer affairs minister Kim Howells, battling daily to smash cartels and ensure consumers are protected by a fully functioning open market. Howells was, of course, a lefty firebrand who spent the Eighties mixing it with the miners in Wales against Thatcherite market reforms. Here is Alan Johnson, minister in charge of the (commercialised) Post Office, now called Consignia. Johnson was the brains behind the defeat of Conservative plans to make the organisation more - well - commercial. And, recently arrived, here is Peter Hain, formerly of the Labour left and CND, now minister for energy and competitiveness in Europe, among the most dapper of Tony Blair's lieutenants, and among the most eager to preach the importance of business and competition. So is Hain a true convert?. When he was appointed in January, not everyone was convinced. One minute Hain was swanning around the world as a junior minister in the Foreign Office; the next he was thinking about new electricity trading arrangements (Neta) and the escalating price of gas. MPs still whisper that Hain is less than chuffed. But, for the record, he's having none of that. Hain clearly believes he has an important role to play, converting what has often been a technical and sensitive job (dealing with the decline of coal mining, for example) into one where political points can be scored. 'He [Blair] said to me \"I want you back in domestic politics, and there are four or five issues that are proving really troublesome\",' he says. 'I have always thought that industry and economics was what made the world tick,' continues the former anti-Apartheid radical. 'Although it matters to UK plc whether I form good relations with Malawi, it is certainly important to the economy and to domestic politics whether we get Neta right.' He is keen to promote controversial areas of policy - taking on oil and gas giants for example - in order to gain credit for dealing with them. And his frequent references to 'his master' suggest that if he isn't taking his lead from Number 10, he wants to be seen to be doing so. Top of the list is the wholesale price of gas, which rose from 12p a therm in 1999 to a 27p peak a year later, falling back to a current 24p, causing great difficulties for big industrial, commercial and even domestic users. Officials at the DTI are unsure of the exact reasons, which is why the European Commission is currently investigating. The Commission is focusing on the gas interconnector between the UK and Europe, which has effectively sucked lower-price UK gas through to Europe where prices are higher, and sucked European prices back to the UK. EC and UK officials suspect that access to the interconnector may not be as open as it should be. It is owned by some of the larger oil and gas operators and there is suspicion of manipulation. On top of this, there is concern that some North Sea operators may be manipulating the supply of gas that is fed into the UK. Hain is not convinced that the big players are playing fair. 'I have asked them to do their best to make sure there are no anti-competitive practices going on. I am not satisfied that, for at least a proportion of the market, that is not happening,' he says. He believes more transparency is needed, so it is clear how much gas is available, where it is, where it is shipped to, and when it goes into the UK system. Regulator Ofgem is reviewing some of these issues. However, he adds that, notwithstanding the EC investigation, 'I would not rule out some other action being taken to the Office [of Fair Trading].' Hain's enthusiasm to see markets working properly has a similar political and opportunistic feel to his colleague Kim Howells' 'rip-off Britain' campaign. In this case ensuring that lower wholesale gas prices help not only companies such as paper millers, and glass and cement manufacturers, but domestic customers, particularly those of independent gas suppliers, who have seen bills rise by up to 6 per cent. Hain believes Neta, which replaces the discredited wholesale electricity pool, will deliver lower electricity bills to customers by matching demand more accurately with supply, and will also help correct swings in wholesale energy prices. Hain is also keen to step back from Neta, and to look strategically at the UK's energy needs. The political top line after Tony Blair's recent environmental speeches is to talk up renewable energy. 'I want to be seen as the champion of the renewables sector. I don't think we have been doing enough as a Government on it.' Hain ensured the Government received credit for the 18 offshore wind farms, designed to deliver 1000MW of power, announced last month. He says he wants to see renewable energy going well above the 10 per cent of UK generation that has been set as a target by 2010. He points to new technologies such as offshore wind, energy from waste, and to \u00a3250m earmarked by the Government to make it happen. Last week he announced \u00a33m for solar housing projects and urged power giants to encourage the uptake of solar power. And, ever in search of the politically painless way out, he cites this target to blunt the impact of the lobbying campaign by the nuclear industry to build new nuclear power stations. Hain says the future of Britain's energy supply is likely to be the subject of a wholesale review after the election, if Labour wins it. He is sceptical about new nuclear stations. 'I would be very surprised if there was an application [to build], because the economics are not there,' he says. 'What I don't want is an energy policy that becomes only gas and nuclear. I am very interested in what renewable can do if they reach the target.' One industrialist said of another Labour DTI alumnus, Peter Mandelson, that he was a moderniser and pro-market - apart from a blind spot with coal mining: thus the 1998 energy review, which froze the building of gas power stations and secured a place for coal. Ironically, it is not because of a Government ban that serried ranks of gas power stations are not now being built, but because of the gas market, which has forced up the price to the point where coal has become competitive again and the returns from a dash for gas do not seem so guaranteed.

We set out to build a presence in Europe so we could leverage our experience in the UK. Whether or not we have a majority stake isn't the issue.' Knapp accepts that it is now make or break time. The cable industry and NTL in particular has an appalling reputation for looking after customers. 'This year we're in a much better state than last. We've sorted out a lot of problems and we're ready to move forward.' No time for a Barclay, then.",

The UK industry directly employs 1.3m people, or almost one job in 20, while indirect employment generated by travel and tourism swells that figure to 3.2m. Graham Wason, vice-president of strategy and development at the WTTC, said that the promotion of the UK to overseas visitors had improved - but more needed to be done. 'The UK has wonderful scenery, a fantastic heritage and tremendous culture. But it has taken the foot and mouth crisis for senior politicians to realise lost tourism business is worth a lot more than our meat export industry,' he said.",

The ruling cannot be contested, and the companies want the money they paid in the Nineties to be returned to their UK subsidiaries.Their British-owned rivals did not have to pay the tax, which has since been amended. Some estimates put the eventual Treasury bill as high as \u00a35 billion. Total Oil, for example, is claiming \u00a370 million, and Deutsche Bank wants \u00a334m. More than 40 firms have so far begun proceedings. But Andrew Martel, a senior tax planner at accountant Arthur Andersen, said they represent 'the tip of the iceberg'. Many more were gearing up for legal action. 'We are suggesting to our clients that they issue protective claims or writs,' he said. He declined to name the clients involved. The Treasury and the Revenue declined to comment on the legal claims, but they are understood to be unlikely to settle the actions before they come before the UK courts. Officials at the Treasury are understood to be pinning their hopes on the High Court, which is expected to hear a test case later this year. The European judgment means some reparations will have to be made, but it is up to the UK court to decide how much. It may, for example, restrict the extent to which claims can be backdated. The Treasury is hoping that the High Court will also decide that the European ruling does not apply to US firms such as Kellogg and Kraft, which have filed claims. David Heathcoat-Amory, the Tory trade and industry spokesman, said: 'Yet again the Government has got hung up by a European Court decision on a domestic matter. The fact that it could now cost taxpayers billions of pounds adds to the charge of incompetence.'",

It's likely we were told all sorts of fascinating things that we didn't already know about advertising but, unfortunately, the participants were wide-eyed with the quasi-religious fervour of righteous capitalism and spoke in tongues, so the message got lost in the medium to the point where even Doris Stokes would have failed as a communications partner to exploit the core brand values of a selection of upmarket lifestyle products. </p> <p>By Tuesday, armed with a well-thumbed copy of Naomi Klein's No Logo, I freed my dog from her Gucci collar (she is strongly aligned with the so-called 'Fluffies' and particularly exercised about the core brand values behind Pedigree Chum's dietary 'recommendations' from those shadowy, elitist 'Top Breeders'), attached her to a piece of biodegradable twine and was all set to travel to Oxford Circus to help the other Fluffies, Wombles, Spikies, Tweenies and Tellytubbies burn down Niketown, when I looked out of the window and spotted great potential for simmering violence as a result of heavy precipitation, so decided to stay in and watch it all on several different TV channels instead. </p> <p>By mid-afternoon there had been 14 arrests and the atmosphere was merely 'deteriorating', as Michael Todd, The Man from the Met (police, as opposed to the weather office), observed hotly to a cool Huw Edwards, on the BBC, 'this is not lawful protest, these are criminals '. I couldn't agree more: 6,000 police corralling 3,000 people for eight hours with no access to lavatories looked pretty criminal from where I was sitting. By the early evening, however, as the news helicopters battled for airspace with the police and a 'deteriorating atmosphere' segued inevitably into an 'extremely tense' one, I am fairly sure I also heard, on Sky, that 'there are reports coming in that the Wombles have broken through a police line', though I may have muddled my notes with those I wrote for the London marathon. </p> <p>Every channel I watched was guilty of making a two-part ITV drama starring Michelle Collins out of a small uncrisis: protests invariably morphed into 'riots' before anybody had chucked a brick, while tense talking heads told us that 'there are only a few hours of daylight left to control the crowd' (presumably the pacifist 'Fluffies' were awaiting their moonlit transmogrification into tooth-baring lupines). One of the very few small voices of calm, however, was that of Nicholas Owen, who observed, in the late afternoon, that things were, basically, 'relatively peaceful', which flagrantly sacrificed sensation in favour of straightforward reporting. In future I'd be very careful, Nicholas, if I were you: there's not much room in today's pacy news coverage for calling a spade 'a spade' when you can call it 'a violent tool of mass mole-extermination' instead. </p> <p>But, as the week progressed I slipped back into my usual lazy capitalist habits and enjoyed the final episode of <strong> Home Stories</strong>, C4's documentary about Britain's postwar property fetishism. As 40 per cent of all marriages now end in divorce and, soon, 80 per cent of all newly created homes will house single people, we are a nation apparently playing at postmodern, post-nuclear Happy Unfamilies. Take Howard, for example, a youngish single 'internet entrepreneur' (the species formerly known as 'nerd') who sold his house in Eccles to buy a loft apartment in Manchester: with its wood floors and \u00a38,000 home cinema, it looked not unlike the offices of a small ad agency. </p> <p>As the formerly painfully-hip loft-living experience is exploited by developers like Barratt, who repackage flats as 'loft-style apartments', the whole dubious lifestyle is therefore accessible to consumers whose tastes are far more padded velveteen headboard than Le Corbusier leather chaise longue, so one can't help feeling that, for the loft-pioneers, the core brand value of the Loft Lifestyle Experience may have become somewhat diluted. Indeed, unmarried couple Paul and Catrin are keen recent converts to loft-living, happily shifting their curtains, three-piece suites and shelving units into a big, uncosy space, which made their home look like a vast National Theatre set for an unlikely new production of Whoops, Vicar, There Go My Trousers!

      "body": "<b> From Morning to Midnight </b> ENO, Coliseum, London WC2 <br> <b> Carmen </b> Pegasus Opera, Bloomsbury Theatre, London WC1 <p> A fortnight ago, English National Opera found itself artistically in the red with a thin production of Trovatore. Now this capricious company has leapt back into credit with a highly bankable world premiere in which money plays a key role. David Sawer's <b> From Morning to Midnight</b> is based on Georg Kaiser's expressionist play of 1917. A bank clerk steals a fortune and finds his life spinning into rakish descent. Love, desire, family, guilt and God make their appearances like ghouls in a peepshow. The mechanical dullness of life at the cash desk - stamping cheques, ringing up tills, counting money - finds ingenious expression in Sawer's densely textured score. At the start, the cashier, John Daszak, is imprisoned by filing cabinets and routine. Glamour beckons from the other side of the counter. He falls for it. </p> <p>Sawer, born in 1961, a successful Composer in Association with the Bournemouth Orchestras, is already well established in the concert sphere. His music has a distinctive mix of sharp, wry clarity and persuasive warmth. This is his first full-scale work in the form. Typically, the scoring is rhythmically imaginative and technically agile. Like Birtwistle, Sawer is drawn to low timbres: contrabassoons, alto flutes, cor anglais and a tuba are here offset by the shrieks, bells and whistles of his enormous percussion sec tion (demanding seven players and more than two dozen different instruments, not to speak of the cashier's own fists). A standard-sized string section adds sensuousness and edge, but their music leaves a less dominant impression on first hearing than the swirls, eddies and voluptuous volleys of woodwind, brass and percussion. </p> <p>The production is crisp and well cast. Richard Jones, who first suggested Kaiser's text to Sawer, is in his element, relishing the clash of humdrum and absurd, pointing up the sour relationship between material wealth and its bankrupting effect on the human soul. In the opening bank scene, finely observed in Steward Laing's designs, the dumb show of messenger boy, fat man, commissionaire and customers - all served by the maniacally tractable cashier - is comic and chilling. From there, we move in quick succession to hotel, nightclub, Salvation Army hall. </p> <p>The only constant is the cashier himself, an Everyman journeying towards his doom. One of the most musically successful scenes is the fourth (of seven), in which his mother, wife and daughter, every bit as terrifying a trio as Wagner's Norns or Macbeth's witches, circle round him in his madness. The wife is frying chops, the old mother dying in front of the telly, the daughter massacring Tannha\u00fcser on an upright piano (with every seventh note going wrong): in all respects an average suburban scene. </p> <p>The big set piece is a bicycle race. A crowd in monstrous monkey masks gather in a spectacular velodrome to watch the six-day event. The cashier, desperate to rid himself of the stolen money, offers a huge cash prize. Sawer's music here twirls and reels in a series of aural pirouettes against the roar of 'Go! Go! Go!' on the terraces. The urgent rush of scales and triplets, offstage band and chorus rise and fall with each race. Breathtaking though it is, this scene feels too long and tangential to the drama. A sneaking suspicion remained that having built this elaborate set, all concerned felt the need to exploit it fully. In the Salvation Army hall too, when sinner after sinner confesses to a background of rousing hymns, less would have been more. But these are small complaints in a triumphant evening. Martyn Brabbins, the conductor, teased masterful playing and singing from orchestra and singers alike. The cast, led by the endlessly versatile Daszak and ably supported by, among others, Kathryn Harries, Susan Bickley, Linda Kitchen and Robert Poulton, deserve praise. </p> <p>Pegasus Opera Company, founded in 1992 after the success of Glyndebourne's Porgy and Bess, describes itself as 'Britain's only multiracial opera company'. There is no reason to doubt the boast. Jessye Norman and a few lesser known black or Asian singers aside, opera the world over remains scarcely more balanced in its racial mix than the Conservative Party. On the evidence of groups such as Ken Burton's London Adventist Chorale (only the most prominent of this country's excellent gospel choirs), the vocal talent exists in abundance. Few make the transition to opera, whether out of choice or through lack of opportunity. Pegasus's founder, Lloyd Newton, believes that opera casting is still riddled with prejudice. Whatever the case, his aim is to offer more chances. The more such singers are brought on, the harder it will be for prejudice to exert itself. </p> <p>In the company's spirited new <b> Carmen</b>, directed by John Abulafia and conducted by Gregory Rose, youthful energy more than compensates for the unevenness of the voices and the rough edges in the production. These will certainly diminish as the tour progresses (nine venues nationwide between now and 14 June). Purists may object to the reworking of the story and the sometimes bumpy English ver sion: a drug baron and a star boxer replace Bizet's original line-up. Young men urinate on stage, women snort cocaine - not such a novelty in this opera, as anyone who saw Opera North's recent production will recall. </p> <p>In the title role, Judy Slater (sharing the part with Alison Crookendale), draws on her training as a sprint champion and dancer to give a febrile, physically exciting account. She sings capably, though her voice is not big (Bloomsbury Theatre is hardly a sympathetic acoustic). As Micaela, the rejected girlfriend from home, Alison Buchanan stole the show. This role never fails to touch us. Had From Morning to Midnight even one character with a similarly involving emotional life, Sawer's expert work would have been elevated to another level of artistry. Of all the organs, it is the heart that tends to get the least exposure in contemporary opera. </p> <p> Pegasus Opera: 020 7501 9501/ <a href=\"http://www.pegopera.org\" target=\"_NEW\">www.pegopera.org</a></p>",

At the same time, the audience is much closer to the actors. Soliloquies, addressed to them directly, are arguments rather than lyrical musings.

The hectic coloured lighting effects which signal changes of mood are overdone (who needs spooky green air to underline the witching hour?). Apart from Alan David's perfectly judged, windbaggy Polonius, the supporting roles are underplayed.

      "body": "<p><strong> Captain Corelli's Mandolin</strong> (105 mins, 15) Directed by John Madden; starring Nicolas Cage, Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, John Hurt </p> <p> What happens when a big bestseller - full of rich characters, subplots, history and narrative drive - turns into a big (budget) movie? Captain Corelli breaks a string on his mandolin, that's what. Most of the richness, maybe inevitably, is declared surplus to screenplay requirements. Only the central core of romance remains - and that, denuded of supporting ingredients, seems thin and overblown. It drags itself into life: it does not drive. </p> <p>But pause, first, in search of a fair precision. John Madden's version of Louis de Berni\u00e8res's novel is no outright disaster. Cephalonia looks beautiful. So does Pen\u00e9lope Cruz. The action sequences towards the end are expertly handled. You won't - especially if you're one of the three people on earth who hasn't read the book - stagger out of the stalls feeling short-changed. You may even contrive a glycerine smear of a tear. The difficulty is in the might-have-beens. </p> <p>It might (just might) have been possible to keep some of the texture - which means the believability and thus human warmth - of the original. But Shawn Slovo's script never begins to meet that test. Problem one: what language are this ostensible collection of Greeks, Italians and Germans supposed to be talking? Slovo and Madden settle for an all-purpose Eastern Med Esperanto, otherwise dee Eenglish with daa flexeebly transferable accent. Zorbaspeak. That makes any trip into the colloquial fraught with peril. When Corelli, as interpreter, tries to negotiate the surrender of the mayor and town council, what do they say? They say: 'fuck off.' Catch the first bus back to Camden town, mate. The words, time and again, get in the way. </p> <p>So does the casting. Of course you need stars - you can't live at the box office without them - but internationalism on this scale verges on the ridiculous. An American (Nicolas Cage) as the lead Italian; a Spaniard (Cruz) as the Greek heroine with an Englishman (John Hurt) as her dad and a Welshman (Christian Bale) as her Ionian peasant lover, plus standard Brits doing their Nazi strut as Germans and real Greeks filling in the cracks in between. Problem two: your real Greeks don't look remotely like your phoney Greeks. Wrong colour, wrong bone structure - the differences fill the screen. </p> <p>Try sinking yourself in the plot, then. Cephalonia 1941; the Italians - an effete gang of opera-loving layabouts - are the main force of occupation. Captain Corelli, a gentle soul who specialises in barber-shop Rossini as well as mandolin plucking, gets billetted with the fragrant Cruz and her wise old doctor dad while Bale is fighting Hitler in the North.

      "bodyText": "Captain Corelli's Mandolin (105 mins, 15) Directed by John Madden; starring Nicolas Cage, Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, John Hurt What happens when a big bestseller - full of rich characters, subplots, history and narrative drive - turns into a big (budget) movie? Captain Corelli breaks a string on his mandolin, that's what. Most of the richness, maybe inevitably, is declared surplus to screenplay requirements. Only the central core of romance remains - and that, denuded of supporting ingredients, seems thin and overblown. It drags itself into life: it does not drive. But pause, first, in search of a fair precision. John Madden's version of Louis de Berni\u00e8res's novel is no outright disaster. Cephalonia looks beautiful. So does Pen\u00e9lope Cruz. The action sequences towards the end are expertly handled. You won't - especially if you're one of the three people on earth who hasn't read the book - stagger out of the stalls feeling short-changed. You may even contrive a glycerine smear of a tear. The difficulty is in the might-have-beens. It might (just might) have been possible to keep some of the texture - which means the believability and thus human warmth - of the original. But Shawn Slovo's script never begins to meet that test. Problem one: what language are this ostensible collection of Greeks, Italians and Germans supposed to be talking? Slovo and Madden settle for an all-purpose Eastern Med Esperanto, otherwise dee Eenglish with daa flexeebly transferable accent. Zorbaspeak. That makes any trip into the colloquial fraught with peril. When Corelli, as interpreter, tries to negotiate the surrender of the mayor and town council, what do they say? They say: 'fuck off.' Catch the first bus back to Camden town, mate. The words, time and again, get in the way. So does the casting. Of course you need stars - you can't live at the box office without them - but internationalism on this scale verges on the ridiculous. An American (Nicolas Cage) as the lead Italian; a Spaniard (Cruz) as the Greek heroine with an Englishman (John Hurt) as her dad and a Welshman (Christian Bale) as her Ionian peasant lover, plus standard Brits doing their Nazi strut as Germans and real Greeks filling in the cracks in between. Problem two: your real Greeks don't look remotely like your phoney Greeks. Wrong colour, wrong bone structure - the differences fill the screen. Try sinking yourself in the plot, then. Cephalonia 1941; the Italians - an effete gang of opera-loving layabouts - are the main force of occupation. Captain Corelli, a gentle soul who specialises in barber-shop Rossini as well as mandolin plucking, gets billetted with the fragrant Cruz and her wise old doctor dad while Bale is fighting Hitler in the North. Love does its blooming thing. Bale comes back looking baleful. Mussolini throws in the towel as the Germans turn murderously on their erstwhile allies. Add an earthquake for luck and consider: who emotes, wins. The hacking down of de Berni\u00e8res - changed ending, editing so brutal that at least one crucial character, the gay Carlo who saves Corelli from the firing squad, becomes inexplicable - doesn't help. Nor does the truncation of real history and real time passing into a few glib devices.

      "body": "<p>I'm not ready to date another New York guy. Most of them seem like some version of my ex-boyfriend, a New York internet entrepreneur. I won't burden you with all the gory details of our messy public breakup. Point is, I think it's time for something more fulfiling.</p> <p>Michelle, a curvaceous, highly strung, 23-year-old TV producer perfectly sums up the typical first date with a New York guy: 'You sit in some ultra-swank SoHo restaurant until trading resumes. Before the date is over, you know his net worth and which house he's renting in the Hamptons this summer. All the while he's adding up the tab in his head, wondering if it's enough to get him laid. And what's really depressing is he desperately lacks the ability to carry on an intelligent conversation.'</p> <p>Lisa, a 29-year-old, vivacious, blond dotcom survivor, who sold early and now owns two restaurants and a beach house, agrees: 'If you do make it to a second or third date, you are forced to have the obligatory \"Where are we headed?\" conversation, followed two dates later by a \"I think I'm having a pre-mid-life crisis\" confession. That's why I only date British men,' she concludes. (She's currently dating her sixth Brit.) 'With them, there's none of that.'</p> <p>I started checking around with other girlfriends, especially ones who had started spending less time with 'the girls'. Turns out a number of them are dating Brits. I already knew about Madonna and Candace Bushnell jumping continents, but was amazed that so many of my girlfriends here at home were dipping into the foreign pudding.</p> <p>Serena is a 34-year-old, streaky blonde, super-smart, serial entrepreneur. Six months ago she fell hard for James, an architect from London, so she sold her company and is now a full- time writer, splitting her time between New York and London.</p> <p>Lesley, 35, is a toffee-skinned, athletic doctor who just got engaged to Maurice, a British expat and president of a New York record label. Maurice waited four years for her to finish med school and wasn't intimidated by her intelligence, unlike a lot of American guys before him.</p> <p>Michelle has what she terms a 'British Man Fetish'. She says she goes after them all the time but can never 'get' a British guy. She even attended University College London for seven months, hoping it would improve the odds. It didn't work, she says, because she's 'too aggressive'. Michelle has cultivated numerous male British friends in New York but can never seem to convert any into a date.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Amy, a 27-year-old writer with almond eyes and fantastic breasts is just coming off a 48-hour fling with a famous British actor. She says it was some of the best sex she has ever had. Amy should know: she's a New York-based sex columnist and author of the book Run Catch Kiss. But I thought the Brits were notoriously bad in bed? Apparently not. It's been a well-kept secret because, sorry girls, there are only so many to go around.</p> <p>Before we jump into bed, let's cover a few of the basics. What's so special about British men? 'Their accent is a total aphrodisiac,' gushes Amy. (Wait, we're not jumping into bed yet.) 'OK, they're hysterically funny and better educated than American guys.' What else? 'They read literature!' shouts Michelle, 'and you can actually have a conversation with them.'</p> <p>'They have a feminine side,' chimes in Lesley.</p> <p>Most American guys are terrified of being called gay and while they're frantically rejecting their own femininity, they can also reject parts of ours. Apparently, British guys aren't like that. 'Just look at the way they dress - they're so stylish!' enthuses Serena. 'They even wear pink!' Then she laughs: 'Sometimes they jumble the clothes, but the accent more than compensates for it.'</p> <p>Then there's the romance. 'My favourite thing about British men? They treat us like ladies,' purrs Lisa.</p> <p>'He meets me at the airport with a bouquet of flowers - every time!' sighs Serena. 'After six months of dating he's still opening cab doors and pulling out chairs for me at restaurants.'</p> <p>I had to ask about the sex. It's been a while for me, so I live vicariously. 'He's gentle, loving and really tuned in,' says Lisa.</p> <p>'They're up for a lot - much more than American guys,' smiles Lesley contentedly.</p> <p>'He loves dirty talk and sexual scenarios,' says Serena. 'American guys take sex way too seriously - my boyfriend brings his sense of humour to bed with us.'</p> <p>Amy confides: 'He gives me a licence to be hedonistic.'</p> <p>If you're a British guy, you definitely have the advantage in terms of attracting and bedding New York women. I'm probably shooting myself in the foot here, but it's true. So many women admit that they always gravitate across a party or a bar towards a British accent. A moderately attractive and intelligent British guy can get laid every night of the week in New York. You probably don't even have to be that intelligent. And just to be clear, I mean with a different and drop-dead-gorgeous girl each night. Fortunately for us battle-weary women, most British guys aren't like this. By the time you've realised that dating equals sex in New York, you're already in love. With one of us. Just one!</p> <p>And that's the real clincher when it comes to the New York woman's attraction for British men. Relative to New York guys, British men seem unafraid of commitment. When an American male turns 40, his world comes crashing down. Michelle explains to me that a British guy has already anticipated at the age of 30 what he wants out of life by the time he's 40. So, when he hits 40, he's looking forward, not back. Serena sums it up: 'When you're ready for a real relationship, date a Brit.'</p> <p>I'm only two months into singledom, but I figure I should get started on British men right away. Maybe it was Lesley and Amy's titillating oral sex claim that did it for me. So how do you date a British guy? As far as I can tell, you go where they go and then just wait for them to come to you. Jennifer explains: 'They always go for a drink at the same place.' This is starting to sound like fishing. Apparently it can sometimes take a long time to catch anything - weeks and even months.</p> <p>'It can be really frustrating,' says Michelle. 'You can have a great conversation with a British guy and then he doesn't ask for your number. They assume that you'll just show up again.'</p> <p>'It's dangerous to ask them out,' adds Tara. 'Asking for their number first is kind of emasculating for them,' explains Serena, 'so you have to be patient and go back a few times, you know, regularly.' Which is a pain, if you ask me, because it's really fun to visit new places.</p> <p>Anxious to get started, I ignore everything I've been told and beg Michelle to set me up with one of her British male 'friends'. She gives me Paul's number. 'Listen, you should know that I really like him but I don't have a chance, so I'll let you have a try.' I think it's kind of weird, but also extremely sweet. 'Should I call him?' I ask, realising that I'm about to break the rules. 'Sure!' she says, 'ask him out!' She is probably being a friend, but I'm starting to wonder if she's setting me up for failure.</p> <p>Paul is a filmmaker and has only been in New York for a month, interviewing production crews for his next feature. I get him on the phone right away. He seems agreeable and asks if I'd like to meet him in Brooklyn for live music that night. Woah! No American guy would ever ask to meet a girl the same night. The American guy always acts extremely busy, even when he's not. It's psychologically to his advantage to make you wait. Apparently, Paul has plenty of free time and isn't afraid to say so. So, he meets me promptly at 9:15pm outside the subway station in Brooklyn. No American guy has ever done something like that. It's always 'Meet me inside the bar.' He is definitely cute and dressed OK, but not what I'd expected.</p> <p>There is nothing really wrong with Paul, but for the rest of the date I come up with every reason why it wouldn't work out. He's two inches shorter than me and he's Jewish (he'll eventually want to marry a nice Jewish girl), but the real problem, I decide, is his lack of a British accent. Something about formative years spent in Canada. So is he a Brit or what? Michelle assures me later that he is, but I've talked myself out of him by then.</p> <p>The following night my girlfriend Cecilia joins me at Centrofly for their weekly Great British House Party. The VIP room is filled with that lilting exotic accent and the cute guy factor is a 10-plus. Natasha, the vivacious publicist for GBH, orders us a round of Raging Bulls.</p> <p>DJ Penelope Tuesday pumps up the dance tunes and the next thing you know, Saville Row-clad British bankers are dancing on table tops to Blondie's Rapture. Soon I'm laughing with Alistair, a 'real' British architect from London, about his 'yoga dating' mishaps. Three Raging Bulls later, I'm telling this extremely embarrassing story about how I recently wound up painted in liquid latex.</p> <p>I'm on my fourth Raging Bull. I'm tipsy. No, I'm sloshed. It's 2am. Time to go home before I do something really embarrassing. Think patience. Fishing.</p> <p>I need to go, but really I want Alistair's number. Instead I say 'Goodbye' and he says 'Nice to meet you.'</p> <p>What's wrong with me? Truth is, I've got a big fat 'R' stuck to my forehead. Rebound! That's why I pooh-poohed Paul and probably why I dashed my chances with Alistair. I'm rebounding. I'm still hurting and not really ready for intimacy. Not ready for a 'real' relationship.

The American guy always acts extremely busy, even when he's not. It's psychologically to his advantage to make you wait. Apparently, Paul has plenty of free time and isn't afraid to say so. So, he meets me promptly at 9:15pm outside the subway station in Brooklyn. No American guy has ever done something like that. It's always 'Meet me inside the bar.' He is definitely cute and dressed OK, but not what I'd expected. There is nothing really wrong with Paul, but for the rest of the date I come up with every reason why it wouldn't work out. He's two inches shorter than me and he's Jewish (he'll eventually want to marry a nice Jewish girl), but the real problem, I decide, is his lack of a British accent. Something about formative years spent in Canada. So is he a Brit or what? Michelle assures me later that he is, but I've talked myself out of him by then. The following night my girlfriend Cecilia joins me at Centrofly for their weekly Great British House Party. The VIP room is filled with that lilting exotic accent and the cute guy factor is a 10-plus. Natasha, the vivacious publicist for GBH, orders us a round of Raging Bulls. DJ Penelope Tuesday pumps up the dance tunes and the next thing you know, Saville Row-clad British bankers are dancing on table tops to Blondie's Rapture. Soon I'm laughing with Alistair, a 'real' British architect from London, about his 'yoga dating' mishaps. Three Raging Bulls later, I'm telling this extremely embarrassing story about how I recently wound up painted in liquid latex. I'm on my fourth Raging Bull. I'm tipsy. No, I'm sloshed. It's 2am. Time to go home before I do something really embarrassing. Think patience. Fishing. I need to go, but really I want Alistair's number. Instead I say 'Goodbye' and he says 'Nice to meet you.' What's wrong with me? Truth is, I've got a big fat 'R' stuck to my forehead. Rebound! That's why I pooh-poohed Paul and probably why I dashed my chances with Alistair. I'm rebounding. I'm still hurting and not really ready for intimacy. Not ready for a 'real' relationship. Not even ready for a Brit. Oversexed and over there Madonna &amp; Guy Ritchie After the success of Ritchie's Lock, Stock &amp; Two Smoking Barrels, Madonna called to say she loved the soundtrack, and wanted to release it on her record label, Maverick. She wined and dined Ritchie on the pretext of business. They married last December in Scotland. Elisabeth Murdoch &amp; Matthew Freud Met in early 1997 and left their respective marriages to be together. Soon after the birth of their daughter, Freud left. Candace Bushnell &amp; Stephen Morris The 42-year-old creator of Sex and the City and the British businessman have been together for 18 months, and Bushnell divides her time between London and New York. Angelina Jolie &amp; Jonny Lee Miller Met on the set of Hackers in New York in 1994 and married two years later. The marriage didn't last long. Uma Thurman &amp; Gary Oldman Married when she was 18, he was 30. It lasted for 18 months. Oldman is now going through his third divorce. Lili Maltese &amp; Henry Dent-Brocklehurst The Hawaiian model and English aristocrat married in 1998.",

      "body": "<p>'He's here, he's here.' The word goes round the crowded balcony at South Africa House. A moment earlier, all attention was on the astonishing spectacle below: Trafalgar Square closed off, a stage built over the fountain, the Landseer lions now serving as the set for a pop concert, 30,000 people swaying, dancing, cheering. A light drizzle makes the scene quintessentially English. Pigeons lift into the air on each clap of percussion. Up on our balcony, Ken Livingstone watches them grimly.</p> <p>Barbara Castle is on a chair, hunched under an umbrella. The great and the good are squashed together up here: Lord Attenborough, Baronesses Amos and Chalker, Greg Dyke, Paul Boateng, Charles Kennedy, Bill Morris, Peter Mandelson. My gaze is fixed on one short figure leaning on the parapet. Ethel de Keyser, who ran Anti-Apartheid, then the British Defence and Aid Fund for Southern Africa (BDAF), now the Canon Collins Trust. She stares down at the square with a tired but contented expression. Who would have thought she'd ever be drinking champagne in South Africa House? Or any of us. This was a building you viewed from the outside only, holding placards and banners, a grim fortress looming over Trafalgar Square. Yet tonight, it's a place of celebration.</p> <p>Incredible. You blink, you pinch yourself. Particularly now, as the symbol of this remarkable transformation arrives in the room behind us and starts towards the open door. 'He's here!' The High Commissioner, Cheryl Carolus, supports his arm. His walk is careful yet steady. He's wearing a hearing aid but it's clearly a good one for Cheryl is speaking to him quietly, warmly, as she introduces people. She uses the traditional term of respect to address him: 'Tata, please meet... and Tata, this is...' He beams at people. They smile back in a special way, as though a bulb has been switched on inside them. This radiant smile passes round the balcony with him. It's impossible not to think of religious imagery.</p> <p>Now it's our turn. I thought I'd be nervous but he's too peaceful a presence. 'Tata, this is Antony Sher and his partner, Greg Doran; they're doing the show for us at the Royal Festival Hall.' The show is a sequel to an event we helped organise at Sadler's Wells in 1988: Two Dogs and Freedom. The title was inspired by a remark made by a six-year-old boy in Soweto: 'When I am old I would like to have a wife and two children, a boy and a girl, and a big house, and two dogs and freedom.'</p> <p>It was just a one-off performance - an anti-apartheid fundraiser, a star-studded gala. Just one of those, yet it marked a big moment for me, the moment when I opened my eyes properly and saw - really saw - the place where I'd been born. During my childhood in the 1950s, Cape Town was a kind of paradise, a sinister paradise where you could have everything you wanted - sun, sea and plenty - as long as you didn't examine your surroundings too keenly. Don't gaze at that island, Robben Island, directly across from the pretty white beaches of Sea Point. Put on dark glasses, lie back in the glorious sunshine. Reach out for that chilled glass of wine, that platter of fresh crayfish. Don't glance at the hand that's serving you, don't worry who they are, what they're feeling. Just eat, drink, close your eyes.</p> <p>My grandparents fled anti-Semitic persecution in Eastern Europe at the turn of the century and ended up in South Africa. I sometimes wonder if God was playing a practical joke or testing them. You've been the underdog, you've been despised, but here's a different option. You can be the masters, others will be the servants. You can be safe, they'll be frightened and poor. That's the choice; now what will you do?</p> <p>Well, surprise surprise, they did nothing. A little cross on a ballot sheet - little effort, little commitment - and then that long, lovely lie in the sun.</p> <p>I didn't begin to wake up until I moved to London in 1968 to attend drama school. Suddenly, I was exposed to British papers, British TV and the recurring image of South Africa House surrounded by demonstrators. Suddenly I heard my country described as an evil place and its system of apartheid as an atrocity. Atrocity? That was a word I knew well. It featured in my readings on the pogroms and the Holocaust. Yet now it was being used about white South Africans. But, hang on a moment, that included my family; it included me.</p> <p>I quickly lost all trace of my accent. I told people I was British. I refused to visit home. I tried to hide who I was. Which you can't do, of course - you just implode. I needed liberating. And as the slogan goes: liberation equals education.</p> <p>Ethel de Keyser became my political guru and still is to this day. Sister of the freedom fighter Jack Tarshish, Ethel was then in charge of BDAF, which provided legal and educational fees for people in need back home. Short, dynamic, with wide, smiling almost Oriental features, Ethel was a tireless campaigner. From morning to night - smoking, clutching a cup of coffee, bustling round the BDAF offices - she found ways of raising money for her cause. People mostly said no to her. This was not a word she knew. Eventually they said yes.</p> <p>It was Ethel who approached me to help organise a gala for them in 1988. I said no. And then yes. For the first time I started meeting the group of South Africans exiled in London, white and black. In fact, it was the first time I was properly meeting any black South Africans. The poet Mongane Serote, the writer Mandla Langa, the musician Jonas Gangwa, his manager, Dali Tambo, the singer Ndonda Khuze. For one reason or another, they'd fled South Africa: Mandla's brother had been murdered by the police. Dali was the son of Oliver Tambo, president of the ANC, forced to operate in exile. All were yearning for home, yearning for the soil but not the system.</p> <p>They were tired, their skin quite grey from too many British winters. They smoked heavily. When they came along to meetings of the organising committee - and they didn't always (we were sometimes embarrassingly white) - they had a particular, distant look in their eyes. Here they were, joining in discussions about costumes and lighting, programmes and dressing-rooms; they really were very far away from home. They saw the humour in it. I liked that in them.</p> <p>Them. I'm talking like my family. Them - an arm's length word. Well, yes, no question. It was strange sitting round a table with them at last. I felt relief.</p> <p>Greg came onboard as director, and the documentary filmmaker Jon Blair recorded the event for Channel 4. Along with the performers already named, an eclectic cast included Bob Hoskins, Archbishop Trevor Huddle ston, Janet Suzman, Pieter Dirk-Uys, Rudolph Walker, the Kinnocks, Harold Pinter, Richard E. Grant, Richard Wilson, Stephen Fry and Spitting Image.</p> <p>I have two abiding memories of the evening. Images of two Jewish South Africans with very different experiences of their country. The first is of Albie Sachs walking onstage after the scene from David Edgar's Jail Diary of Albie Sachs to hug the actor who has just played him, Roger Rees. Albie can do neither thing easily, walk or hug; this is just seven months after the South African secret service car bomb in Maputo which tore off one arm, blinded one eye and damaged his balance. Yet he's smiling, lifting his good arm in celebration.</p> <p>The second memory is of myself during the final chorus of 'N'Kosi Sikele' . I'm towards the back of the huge cast, hoping that the C4 cameras can't find me. I'm crying, partly because of the impact of the show and partly because I don't yet know the words of this song, their song.</p> <p>The Sowetan boy whose words inspired Two Dogs and Freedom is 19 now. Has he got any of the items on his wish-list, I wonder? A wife? A house? Don't know, but he's certainly got the important one: freedom.</p> <p>In 1990, along with the rest of the world, I watched in wonder as one man walked out of prison and made a miracle happen: a peaceful transition from the Old to the New South Africa. It's the same man whose hand I'm shaking tonight on the balcony of South Africa House. Cheryl Carolus guides him into a side-room. Now Tony and Cherie Blair arrive, with their children, and Cheryl takes them into the room too. A tray with coffee, champagne, and South African snacks follows them in.</p> <p>Like a great actress, Cheryl has completely reinvented the role of diplomat. She's warm, funny, spontaneous, a terrific enthusiast. People fall in love within minutes of meeting her. I have only one complaint: like Ethel de Keyser, she doesn't understand the word no. When she invited Greg and me to do a follow-up to Two Dogs and Freedom we said absolutely not. Our schedules simply wouldn't allow it. Very flattered to be asked, but no.</p> <p>So here we are, doing Freedom Too! It'll be a benefit for the Canon Collins Trust. The distinguished South African director Janice Honeyman has come over to help stage the epic. Jazz legend Hugh Masekela is also flying in, as are the great singer, Sibongile Khumalo, the new stand-up whizz-kid, Marc Lottering, two leading actors, Sello Maake ka Ncube and James Ngcobo, and the unique dance group, Tswaragano. Several veterans of the last show are joining the ranks - Pieter-Dirk Uys, Janet Suzman, Richard E. Grant, Richard Wilson, the Kinnocks - as well as the Lion King company, which boasts a large South African contingent.</p> <p>We're part of the Celebrate South Africa festivities and although the evening will be upbeat in tone, it will also focus on some of the tougher issues in contemporary South Africa: Aids, crime, the work of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.</p> <p>On the balcony of South Africa House we all surge to the edge as a tremendous cheer fills the air.

      "byline": "Peter Conrad",

      "body": "<p>The soprano Karita Mattila - who in my view is simply the greatest singing actress in the world - has been known to combine music with striptease. </p> <p>At the stuffy Mozarteum in Salzburg last summer, she paused during a song cycle by her Finnish compatriot Jouni Kaipainen to rip off her cloak of golden spangles, then bent down to remove her shoes: not mere exhibitionism, but a way of dramatising Kaipainen's point about the artist's need to shed disguises. Last September, celebrating her fortieth birthday at a concert in Helsinki, she regaled an audience of 12,000 with arias by Wagner, Verdi and Puccini, then changed to a clinging sheath of pink polka dots to bump and grind through songs associated with two earlier bewitching blondes - Dietrich's fatal anthem 'Falling in Love Again' and Monroe's rapacious credo 'Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend'. 'I am,' she said to me last week, 'a physical type.' </p> <p>Arriving in a sedate, murmurous Maida Vale caf\u00e9 for our meeting, she proved the point by rehearsing Salome's dance of the seven veils. Off came a silver raincoat, the colour of an astronaut's uniform, to reveal a lilac pants suit; she then unwound a rosy scarf from her precious throat, set down a bag which had cost several crocodiles their lives, fixed me with her luminous eyes, gripped my wrist as if to steady me, and was ready to begin. </p> <p> I should have brought her a present, but all I could think of to give her was a banana. This year at the New York Met, as the disguised Leonore in Beethoven's Fidelio, she transformed herself into a khaki-clad, crop-headed boy, and entered stumbling beneath the weight of her grocery shopping. Slumped wearily at a kitchen table, she unpeeled a banana and ate it. The action was typical of her compulsion to ground opera in everyday reality. I asked if she would have been offended by such a present. 'No, of course not,' she guffawed. The exotic, orchidaceous Mattila grows out of the soil: she is a farmer's daughter. </p> <p>From bananas we passed to pinpricks. She had recently injured her knee during rehearsals for the Royal Opera's new production of Tchaikovsky's Queen of Spades, and had to undergo acupuncture. </p> <p>'I told the doctor I was frightened of the needle, and couldn't even watch him inject it. Then I cried for an hour - it was the emotional pressure. Afterwards I felt so much better!' She might have been describing my emotions when watching one of her enraptured, often crazily intense performances. </p> <p>I have adored Mattila ever since I first heard her, in Mozart's Cos\u00ec fan tutte, in Houston in 1989. Not long before, she had been the first winner of the Cardiff Singer of the World contest; for the next few years she gave perfect performances of Mozart - vocally serene, dramatically subtle. But was she discontented, unfulfilled. 'I was in my knots! When I see old videos from that time, I am stiff as a dead tree.' </p> <p>In 1995, during a production of Strauss's Elektra in Salzburg, something happened. Claudio Abbado had persuaded Mattila to risk singing Chrysothemis, whose erotic frenzy challenges the vindictive mania of Elektra. 'I worried about doing it, but Claudio promised to look after me, and when I got on stage for the last scene, I simply sang my heart out.' </p> <p>Arms flailing, she treated the caf\u00e9 patrons to a sotto voce reprise of Chrysothemis's sensual hymn. 'No one told me to sing softer - and it felt so good! Something exploded in me. In Finland I was brought up to think that anything which gave you pleasure must be bad, so I panicked and came straight back to London to see my teacher, Vera Rosza. I thought I must have damaged my voice with all that screaming. But she listened and said,' - Mattila imitates her mentor's Hungarian accent with affectionate finesse - '\"Dollink, you are in vantastik vorrm!\"' </p> <p>She has remained in that form ever since. Her trapped, unhappy Elisabeth de Valois in Verdi's Don Carlos at Covent Garden in 1996 was heart-rending. Her whole body sang: that dutiful, ramrod back, and those eloquent hands, clasped in anxiety or dangling in despair. At the Met, her Elsa in Wagner's Lohengrin shone from within, despite the balletic postures prescribed by the director Robert Wilson. In Salzburg, her Donna Anna in Don Giovanni suffered a nervous breakdown while singing Mozart's astral coloratura, destroyed by an illicit love for the libertine who has assaulted her. And in Paris, allowing herself a break from tragedy, she was an irresistibly skittish millionairess in Leh\u00e1r's Merry Widow, waltzing on high heels. </p> <p>Lisa in The Queen of Spades is another of her rhapsodic, obsessive creatures, destroyed by a demon lover. 'I understand these Slavic characters, they are very close to me. I once offended a Swedish colleague when she asked me to take part in a concert with a Scandinavian theme. I said, very spontaneously, \"But Finland is not Scandinavia\". She was most upset. Ah, we Finns are not good diplomats!' </p> <p>Mattila herself is undiplomatically honest in her professional judgments. She laments the negligence of Luca Ronconi who, having filled the stage of his Salzburg Don Giovanni with vintage cars and steam trains, played with these toys and ignored the characters. She hated last summer's Salzburg Cos\u00ec fan tutte, in which the director Hans Neuenfels made her exercise a pair of canine leather boys in bondage gear. She names and shames other singers - 'so-called artists' - who perform by rote or dodge rehearsals. 'That,' she said, thumping the caf\u00e9 table, 'is not good enough! For me the most hated thing is routine. It insults the audience. They pay so much, and they want to open up, to be changed by what we do. They need to be touched.' Mattila always has to act out her meaning: she grabbed my arm again, to signal the transmission of energy that must happen in performance. When Mattila sings, you are seared by a sacred fire. Even across a caf\u00e9 table while she's talking, the incandescence is fierce. </p> <p>Those floods of tears she shed in response to the needle transform pain into joy, just as her singing does. We call the process acupuncture; Aristotle's term was catharsis. The emotional pressure beneath Mattila's fair skin is turbulent, eruptive. Discussing the distress of Leonore in Fidelio - her readiness to sacrifice herself, and her dismay about the harm she does to those she deceives - she paused, a tear squeezed out of the corner of her almond-shaped eye. It slowly travelled down her cheek, testimony to her fervent sincerity. </p> <p>Later she talked about the last performance of that New York Fidelio, when the chorus members gathered round to say how much they would miss the experience of performing with her, buoyed up on the same ocean of sound. She stopped talking, looked away, then apologised and began to sob. It was as if a tempest had agitated the brittle Maida Vale tea cups. 'I have so much adrenaline, I cry so easily,' she said. So do I during her performances: she is the emotional equivalent of a spring shower, shocking you into new life. </p> <p>In the frozen North, they call Mattila the Finnish Venus. On New Year's Eve in 1999, she appeared on television during a global relay to sing Sibelius's Luonnotar, an orchestral song about earth's genesis. In it, the Mother of the Waters gives birth to the world; Mattila - a voluptuous goddess in a gold dress, delivering Sibelius's incantations in a voice at once spiritually exultant and carnally wild - looked capable of doing exactly that. </p> <p>'I used to be so frustrated, so annoyed,' she said. Opera can be so fake. As my husband says, it's really difficult to look intelligent when you're singing! But at last I feel I am overcoming my limits, escaping from the strict, old-fashioned country upbringing I had. I made my mistakes. Now I am beginning to realise what I might be capable of, if I have great directors and conductors to challenge me and help me. Aren't I lucky?' She beamed, aware that her good luck is also ours. </p> <p>Then she repaired her smeared eyes, gave me two kisses I shall always treasure, and whirled away, still talking. 'I am not able,' she warned me, 'to give short answers'; her talk is as generous and unguarded as her singing. She left me speechless, which doesn't often happen - but music is more eloquent than words, and in any case she had anticipated my last lines before I could utter them. 'Not long ago,' she told me, 'I said to my husband, \"You know, I really believe in opera\". I didn't always, but now I think it can be complete, it can be everything: music and drama together, with such tremendous power. It is almost a religion. No, it is better, it is religion at its best.' After a disenchanted, agnostic period, I too believe in opera again because I believe in her. </p> <p> Queen of Spades opens 12 May at Royal Opera House (020 7304 4000)</p>",

      "bodyText": "The soprano Karita Mattila - who in my view is simply the greatest singing actress in the world - has been known to combine music with striptease. At the stuffy Mozarteum in Salzburg last summer, she paused during a song cycle by her Finnish compatriot Jouni Kaipainen to rip off her cloak of golden spangles, then bent down to remove her shoes: not mere exhibitionism, but a way of dramatising Kaipainen's point about the artist's need to shed disguises. Last September, celebrating her fortieth birthday at a concert in Helsinki, she regaled an audience of 12,000 with arias by Wagner, Verdi and Puccini, then changed to a clinging sheath of pink polka dots to bump and grind through songs associated with two earlier bewitching blondes - Dietrich's fatal anthem 'Falling in Love Again' and Monroe's rapacious credo 'Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend'. 'I am,' she said to me last week, 'a physical type.' Arriving in a sedate, murmurous Maida Vale caf\u00e9 for our meeting, she proved the point by rehearsing Salome's dance of the seven veils. Off came a silver raincoat, the colour of an astronaut's uniform, to reveal a lilac pants suit; she then unwound a rosy scarf from her precious throat, set down a bag which had cost several crocodiles their lives, fixed me with her luminous eyes, gripped my wrist as if to steady me, and was ready to begin. I should have brought her a present, but all I could think of to give her was a banana. This year at the New York Met, as the disguised Leonore in Beethoven's Fidelio, she transformed herself into a khaki-clad, crop-headed boy, and entered stumbling beneath the weight of her grocery shopping. Slumped wearily at a kitchen table, she unpeeled a banana and ate it. The action was typical of her compulsion to ground opera in everyday reality. I asked if she would have been offended by such a present. 'No, of course not,' she guffawed. The exotic, orchidaceous Mattila grows out of the soil: she is a farmer's daughter. From bananas we passed to pinpricks. She had recently injured her knee during rehearsals for the Royal Opera's new production of Tchaikovsky's Queen of Spades, and had to undergo acupuncture. 'I told the doctor I was frightened of the needle, and couldn't even watch him inject it. Then I cried for an hour - it was the emotional pressure. Afterwards I felt so much better!' She might have been describing my emotions when watching one of her enraptured, often crazily intense performances. I have adored Mattila ever since I first heard her, in Mozart's Cos\u00ec fan tutte, in Houston in 1989. Not long before, she had been the first winner of the Cardiff Singer of the World contest; for the next few years she gave perfect performances of Mozart - vocally serene, dramatically subtle. But was she discontented, unfulfilled. 'I was in my knots! When I see old videos from that time, I am stiff as a dead tree.' In 1995, during a production of Strauss's Elektra in Salzburg, something happened. Claudio Abbado had persuaded Mattila to risk singing Chrysothemis, whose erotic frenzy challenges the vindictive mania of Elektra. 'I worried about doing it, but Claudio promised to look after me, and when I got on stage for the last scene, I simply sang my heart out.' Arms flailing, she treated the caf\u00e9 patrons to a sotto voce reprise of Chrysothemis's sensual hymn. 'No one told me to sing softer - and it felt so good! Something exploded in me. In Finland I was brought up to think that anything which gave you pleasure must be bad, so I panicked and came straight back to London to see my teacher, Vera Rosza. I thought I must have damaged my voice with all that screaming. But she listened and said,' - Mattila imitates her mentor's Hungarian accent with affectionate finesse - '\"Dollink, you are in vantastik vorrm!\"' She has remained in that form ever since. Her trapped, unhappy Elisabeth de Valois in Verdi's Don Carlos at Covent Garden in 1996 was heart-rending. Her whole body sang: that dutiful, ramrod back, and those eloquent hands, clasped in anxiety or dangling in despair. At the Met, her Elsa in Wagner's Lohengrin shone from within, despite the balletic postures prescribed by the director Robert Wilson.

My friend's daughter, who is 20, has always been independent but since her parents split, she has become very clingy to her mother and moved back to the family home.</p> <p>My friend is in a quandary. She needs her own space to sort herself out but feels unable to add to her daughter's insecurity by asking her to leave. Is she right to put her child's feelings above her own, or should she put herself first? <br>C.B. of Surrey</p> <p>Leaving home is a critical event in the life of a young adult and her parents and the lead-up can be a bumpy ride for either party. At around 18, restlessness and boredom contribute to confrontational attitudes, while parents become more critical and less tolerant.</p> <p>The problem is usually resolved amicably because deep down, all parties want the same thing, namely a parting of the ways. So the children move on, welcoming freedom and the chance to make their own mistakes, accepting in exchange a degree of privation and diminished comfort.</p> <p>A little bit of distance really does makes hearts grow fonder and the pattern is set for excellent long-term relationships. Even if a child thereafter moves back temporarily, the umbilical cord has been severed, an essential individuality achieved.</p> <p>Your friend has no doubt been through this process satisfactorily before her present crisis. The daughter's behaviour seems an exaggerated response for a 20-year-old to her parents' split.</p> <p>I wonder if she is doing this to support her mother under the mistaken belief that her presence and support are vital. She may believe that her mother's protests are not to be taken at their face-value, so she is practising a little role-reversal.</p> <p>If so, they are living in an uncomfortable, double-blind world of mutual misinterpretation. So much domestic pathology arises from misunderstandings that I think the mother would be best advised to come clean about her true wishes.</p> <p>The morality of the situation depends on whose perspective you adopt. From a detached viewpoint, it is the mother who has endured the loss and the greatest trauma. The daughter has not lost either parent, although the family unity is destroyed, and her sorrow is suffered in sympathy rather than directly. Therefore, the mother deserves priority in acknowledgment of her needs.</p> <p>If the daughter really is motivated by an unselfish wish to combat loneliness and isolation she will no doubt be relieved to discover that the sacrifice of her own liberty is not necessary. If she has regressed in emotional maturity because of her father's actions, and has moved back to her mother's orbit for her own condolence, then it's time she perceived her mother's greater need.</p> <p>Besides, at 20, her resilience and powers of coping are significantly greater then at 40 or 50.</p> <p>Either way, your friend should kindly and firmly explain to her that it's much better to move out to her own space, pick up her own life again, but still exchange mutual support from a comfortable distance.</p> <p><b> Readres' replies</b></p> <p>This dilemma strikes a chord with me as I was 22 when my parents split up. I was very confused as I understood why my mum had left my dad for someone else but then also fully understood why my dad was so distraught.</p> <p>I felt as if a bomb had exploded under everything I had ever known and my emotions had lost all their foundations.</p> <p>I can see why the daughter in the dilemma would run home to mummy for some security in such an unsafe time but it will not do either of them any good.</p> <p>The one thing I took out of the experience is that everybody in the family has to work out how they feel about the break-up and how they feel towards each of the parties involved.</p> <p>They have to do this on their own. I felt I was the only one who could understand all sides and therefore had to help everybody. I now realise that was a way of avoiding working out what I felt myself.</p> <p>If the daughter stays with her mother then she may not see her father's point of view, or her own, which she will have to do eventually. Equally, the mother's views will be confused with those of her daughter and although it will be very hard to ask her daughter to leave, it will just prolong the heal ing process for both of them if she does not. <br> J.T. of Bristol</p> <p><b> Next week's dilemma</b></p> <p>I am 25 years old and have just starting seeing a married man of 32. He lives in Birmingham so we only get to see each other every couple of weeks. In June, his wife is going to be away for two weeks, holidaying by herself. He has suggested we go away together during the first of those weeks.</p> <p>However, it clashes with an arrangement I have made with a close friend. I desperately want to cancel my previous engagement so I can spend some much cherished time with this man who I am only starting to get to know.</p> <p>Please do not preach to me about the rights and wrongs of seeing a married man. My dilemma is more about how I can justify cancelling my friend in favour of a lover. <br> M.B. of London</p> <p>Write to Observer Review or email margaret.cook@observer.co.uk.

      "bodyText": "A friend of mine has recently split up from her husband of 22 years. He has left her for a younger woman who has subsequently had a baby. My friend's daughter, who is 20, has always been independent but since her parents split, she has become very clingy to her mother and moved back to the family home. My friend is in a quandary. She needs her own space to sort herself out but feels unable to add to her daughter's insecurity by asking her to leave. Is she right to put her child's feelings above her own, or should she put herself first? C.B. of Surrey Leaving home is a critical event in the life of a young adult and her parents and the lead-up can be a bumpy ride for either party. At around 18, restlessness and boredom contribute to confrontational attitudes, while parents become more critical and less tolerant. The problem is usually resolved amicably because deep down, all parties want the same thing, namely a parting of the ways. So the children move on, welcoming freedom and the chance to make their own mistakes, accepting in exchange a degree of privation and diminished comfort. A little bit of distance really does makes hearts grow fonder and the pattern is set for excellent long-term relationships. Even if a child thereafter moves back temporarily, the umbilical cord has been severed, an essential individuality achieved. Your friend has no doubt been through this process satisfactorily before her present crisis. The daughter's behaviour seems an exaggerated response for a 20-year-old to her parents' split. I wonder if she is doing this to support her mother under the mistaken belief that her presence and support are vital. She may believe that her mother's protests are not to be taken at their face-value, so she is practising a little role-reversal. If so, they are living in an uncomfortable, double-blind world of mutual misinterpretation. So much domestic pathology arises from misunderstandings that I think the mother would be best advised to come clean about her true wishes. The morality of the situation depends on whose perspective you adopt. From a detached viewpoint, it is the mother who has endured the loss and the greatest trauma. The daughter has not lost either parent, although the family unity is destroyed, and her sorrow is suffered in sympathy rather than directly. Therefore, the mother deserves priority in acknowledgment of her needs. If the daughter really is motivated by an unselfish wish to combat loneliness and isolation she will no doubt be relieved to discover that the sacrifice of her own liberty is not necessary. If she has regressed in emotional maturity because of her father's actions, and has moved back to her mother's orbit for her own condolence, then it's time she perceived her mother's greater need. Besides, at 20, her resilience and powers of coping are significantly greater then at 40 or 50. Either way, your friend should kindly and firmly explain to her that it's much better to move out to her own space, pick up her own life again, but still exchange mutual support from a comfortable distance. Readres' replies This dilemma strikes a chord with me as I was 22 when my parents split up. I was very confused as I understood why my mum had left my dad for someone else but then also fully understood why my dad was so distraught. I felt as if a bomb had exploded under everything I had ever known and my emotions had lost all their foundations. I can see why the daughter in the dilemma would run home to mummy for some security in such an unsafe time but it will not do either of them any good. The one thing I took out of the experience is that everybody in the family has to work out how they feel about the break-up and how they feel towards each of the parties involved. They have to do this on their own. I felt I was the only one who could understand all sides and therefore had to help everybody. I now realise that was a way of avoiding working out what I felt myself. If the daughter stays with her mother then she may not see her father's point of view, or her own, which she will have to do eventually. Equally, the mother's views will be confused with those of her daughter and although it will be very hard to ask her daughter to leave, it will just prolong the heal ing process for both of them if she does not. J.T. of Bristol Next week's dilemma I am 25 years old and have just starting seeing a married man of 32. He lives in Birmingham so we only get to see each other every couple of weeks. In June, his wife is going to be away for two weeks, holidaying by herself. He has suggested we go away together during the first of those weeks. However, it clashes with an arrangement I have made with a close friend. I desperately want to cancel my previous engagement so I can spend some much cherished time with this man who I am only starting to get to know. Please do not preach to me about the rights and wrongs of seeing a married man. My dilemma is more about how I can justify cancelling my friend in favour of a lover.

The Premiership will miss Coventry in the way that a tallboy is missed after spending years in the spare room. It is noticed more when it has gone than when it was there. Gregory pleaded eloquently for Strachan to be allowed to stay on at Highfield Road. \"I've a tremendous admiration for Gordon as a person and as a manager,\" he said. \"I hope everybody stays calm over there. He's the man to bring them straight back up.\" For the moment, it seems, Strachan's job is safe. Gregory's own future at Villa Park will depend on next season bearing considerably more fruit than the promise of an Intertoto Cup run. In the programme his end-of-season message of thanks mentioned everyone bar the stadium cat before it got around to the Villa chairman, Doug Ellis. Barnsley, Burnley and Grimsby may beckon for Coventry next season but at least it will be different. Neither Gregory nor Villa can afford more of the same.",

Three minutes later the Czech sent Owen scurrying away to sink the black and white revival. Another substitute, Robbie Fowler, lofted the ball from his own half for the 21-year-old to flick in off the far post and claim his second hat-trick ball of the season.</p> <p>\"I feel stronger and faster again,\" said Owen. \"The head injury I sustained at Derby kept me out for a while earlier in the season and trying to get back after a long lay-off is always hard.

A first home goal from their beloved striker since January 1 came after Kevin Kilbane had set up victory with a superb opener. And then there was Kevin Kyle, making an encouraging first appearance for the club.</p> <p>But it was another Kevin who dictated that Sunderland removed one of their rivals from the chase for a Uefa Cup place. Charlton's substitute Kevin Lisbie reprieved the home side when he misdirected a header after being left in space six yards from goal.</p> <p>\"It was an important miss,\" grimaced Charlton's manager Alan Curbishley, but he shared the blame around his team. \"The defence has been our problem. We've let in too many goals and that might explain why we are not in the top six.\"</p> <p>That slackness was best illustrated when they failed to spot the danger as Phillips sprinted into space to crisply convert Don Hutchison's cross five minutes after the break.</p> <p>Two earlier near-misses epitomised how things have gone for Phillips in recent weeks, with his shortage of goals and his wife's return south to prepare for the birth of twins fuelling whispers of a move.</p> <p>The crowd's response to the overdue goal showed they want him to stay - and his undisguised delight suggested he may oblige. There was no doubt who the goal was dedicated to as Phillips ran back with his arms indicating the babies' bulge. A double, perhaps, would have been appropriate.</p> <p>\"It was a good moment,\" said the manager Peter Reid, who needs a win at Everton on the final day and hopes Chelsea falter. \"The reaction of the crowd and boy himself showed what it meant to everybody.\"</p> <p>Phillips said: \"When I came here four years ago nobody dreamed of us trying to qualify for Europe and here we are with a realistic chance.\"</p> <p>Kilbane did much to keep their prospects alive, setting the tempo with some early runs and producing an exquisite finish for the lead. Mathias Svensson equalised before Niall Quinn and Kevin Phillips earned Sunderland a cushion which became less comfortable as Claus Jensen pulled one back, Mark Fish hit a post and Lisbie missed the target.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Sunderland followers, accustomed to chanting \"Super Kev\" in tribute to Kevin Phillips were spoilt for choice. A first home goal from their beloved striker since January 1 came after Kevin Kilbane had set up victory with a superb opener. And then there was Kevin Kyle, making an encouraging first appearance for the club. But it was another Kevin who dictated that Sunderland removed one of their rivals from the chase for a Uefa Cup place. Charlton's substitute Kevin Lisbie reprieved the home side when he misdirected a header after being left in space six yards from goal. \"It was an important miss,\" grimaced Charlton's manager Alan Curbishley, but he shared the blame around his team. \"The defence has been our problem. We've let in too many goals and that might explain why we are not in the top six.\" That slackness was best illustrated when they failed to spot the danger as Phillips sprinted into space to crisply convert Don Hutchison's cross five minutes after the break. Two earlier near-misses epitomised how things have gone for Phillips in recent weeks, with his shortage of goals and his wife's return south to prepare for the birth of twins fuelling whispers of a move. The crowd's response to the overdue goal showed they want him to stay - and his undisguised delight suggested he may oblige. There was no doubt who the goal was dedicated to as Phillips ran back with his arms indicating the babies' bulge. A double, perhaps, would have been appropriate. \"It was a good moment,\" said the manager Peter Reid, who needs a win at Everton on the final day and hopes Chelsea falter. \"The reaction of the crowd and boy himself showed what it meant to everybody.\" Phillips said: \"When I came here four years ago nobody dreamed of us trying to qualify for Europe and here we are with a realistic chance.\" Kilbane did much to keep their prospects alive, setting the tempo with some early runs and producing an exquisite finish for the lead. Mathias Svensson equalised before Niall Quinn and Kevin Phillips earned Sunderland a cushion which became less comfortable as Claus Jensen pulled one back, Mark Fish hit a post and Lisbie missed the target.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>On the sixteenth floor of IPC's headquarters on London's Southbank, large letters spelling the name 'Nova' had been hung above the entrance to the editorial offices. A few months ago, some wag removed the 'N'. Last Wednesday morning, that prophecy came true. </p> <p>Almost a year to the day since its launch, it was indeed over for Nova, the title that was intended to be a cutting-edge fashion magazine for women in their early twenties. The editor, Jeremy Langmead, who'd been on board for just six months, and his team of 20 were told that the June issue would be the last. 'I left a good job to join Nova,' said Jeremy on Friday when I phoned him to commiserate. Indeed he had left the Sunday Times, where he was editor of the Style section. 'It was a crazy but fun few months, but at least I left Nova with a shoe collection to rival Imelda Marcos's.' </p> <p>Jeremy has had a magazine fold beneath him before. It was back in 1990 and we were both working at Mirabella, a title for women in their thirties that lasted precisely 10 issues. But launching a magazine today makes those halcyon times of 10 years ago seem like a walk in the park. </p> <p>I've just finished two years as editor of Marie Claire (the current issue, featuring the girls from Hear'Say, is my last), and when Jeremy joined my stable - Southbank Publishing at IPC - we traded stories from the front line of the battle for readers and advertisers in an increasingly crowded market. That market had already seen the launches of not just Nova but Eve, Aura, The Fashion, Pop and Bare. </p> <p>As an editor, you learn very quickly what works on your cover. And, for better or for worse, what works at the moment is celebrities (as well as a smile, the colour red, and lots of cover lines). I put that into practice fast on Marie Claire with my first cover in July 1999, featuring the Appleton sisters from All Saints. I put a model on the cover a few issues later and sales dropped. </p> <p> Vogue, too, has found that celebs work best - even though it has its pick of the supermodels. A Robbie Williams cover was its bestseller last year. But Jeremy Langmead had proudly said that his readers were not interested in Jennifer Lopez's bottom or Jennifer Aniston's hair. And for a style-savvy fashion bible there aren't that many stars who fit the bill. Actress Chlo\u00eb Sevigny, perhaps? </p> <p>At one of the endless focus groups he was subjected to (editors stand weeping on one side of a mirror watching readers maul their mag), one reader piped up with a suggestion: 'They should let Posh Spice write a feature.' It was mooted by management that Nova 'go down the celebrity route', an idea that made Jeremy blanch. </p> <p>This time last year everything seemed to bode well for Nova: The launch team, under the first editor Deborah Bee, spent more than a year working on the dummy. The TV advertising campaign - with hip young boys and girls throwing eggs at each other - was spot on. Bee's first cover, featuring Brazilian model of the moment Ana Claudia in a modern take on Twiggy, was stunning. </p> <p>But then it all started to go wrong. The magazine was deemed too masculine, too wordy, too esoteric. There were no signposts to tell you what the pages were about. </p> <p>The fashion director, Venetia Scott, and her partner, the photographer Juergen Teller, were both hugely talented but hard to control. One particular fashion shoot, where accessories were photographed on grotesque bodies at an American nudist camp, didn't go down too well in the notoriously conservative fashion capital of Milan. </p> <p>The death knell for Nova was the undignified scramble for readers in the spring of this year. We saw the launch of Warners' InStyle in March and Cond\u00e9 Nast's Glamour in April, both offshoots of hugely successful American titles. If you had taken a stroll along the newsstand of your local WH Smith in April, you would have seen Vogue, with a celebrity style supplement attached to its waist; New Woman, with a free personal organiser; and Nova, with a free novel. Only Marie Claire, with its Bridget Jones theme, was unpromoted. </p> <p>Circulation has over the past few years become more an issue of how much money is spent on promotion than on how good a publication is. Readers go with the gifts, not the magazine. As editors, we can't tell if our magazines are working because sales are so distorted by the freebies. </p> <p>All this competition should be great for creativity: who can secure the best cover, the funniest writers, the most original ideas. But when a free bag is in the offing, even a cover showing a naked Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt would have trouble competing. </p> <p> 'They promoted Nova before they got it right,' said one IPC marketing executive. 'Get your product right first!' InStyle's first cover was a beaming Julia Roberts - an old American InStyle cover shot recycled for the British market. Glamour , too, can use the clout of its giant American sister magazine - and others in the Cond\u00e9 Nast stable - to procure celebrities and stories. Here again Nova was at a disadvantage. </p> <p>At Marie Claire, up against so much American competition, we decided to trust our Britishness - using less airbrushing, fewer Oscar gowns, and more mouthy, homegrown stars of the likes of Geri Halliwell (an issue that sold out, incidentally). But on magazine shelves, which are nowadays all so girly and frivolous, Nova seemed somewhat alien. </p> <p>When the magazine launched, its unique selling point was single-sentence cover lines - for example 'Kate gets personal'. Its cover stars remained unsmiling and moody-looking. But nowadays, when the average time spent choosing a magazine and lifting it off the shelf is about three seconds, the covers make or break a magazine. You need lots of cover lines, and they all have to be compelling. </p> <p>What killed Nova wasn't just its lack of readers - unsurprising when you look at the above - but the lack of advertising. For a fashion magazine, advertising means Milan, home of the big hitters including Armani, Versace, Prada, Gucci and the rest. </p> <p>I remember when I first joined Marie Claire and went to Milan to meet the incredibly svelte, well-groomed and well-dressed women at Prada. I proudly recited the extraordinary circulation figures of the latest Marie Claire. 'Ah, but you are too mass-market. We prefer niche magazines,' I was told. Persuading Prada and Gucci to buy space in Marie Claire took two years; Jeremy was given four issues. It's an extraordinary Catch-22 situation: you need sales for profit and to please some advertisers, but for those all-important labels you also need to be cool and exclusive, using the right photographers and the models of the moment. </p> <p> Nova certainly succeeded there (the gorgeous Karolina is on the cover of the latest and last issue; she was on Vogue the month before). But Nova, like Marie Claire, was handicapped by the Cond\u00e9 Nast stranglehold on lucrative contracts with star photographers like Mario Testino, Nick Knight and Steven Klein. </p> <p>Even young, up-and-coming photographers often won't work for you because they want to hold out for Vogue and that lucrative advertising campaign. Model agents, too, won't let the top girls do a cover before they have appeared on Vogue - and will wait for that chance, even if it never happens. Against such odds, it's amazing Nova lasted as long as it did. </p> <p>Now that Jeremy and I have left the world of magazines to become civilians again, I am reminded of what happened when we were booted out of Mirabella . </p> <p>Having hired Jeremy from St Martin's, I felt very responsible for him. He was sure he wouldn't work in the industry again and I asked him what he wanted to do instead. </p> <p>'Painting,' he replied. So I hired him to decorate my flat. It took him more than two months because he was so inept. It was only recently he told me he'd meant canvases, not walls. </p> <p><strong>Women's mags</strong></p> <p><strong> Total market size: </strong> 452 million copies sold in 2000, against 502 million in 1995 </p> <p><strong> Monthlies: </strong> Volume sales down by 11 per cent 1995-1999 </p> <p><strong> Weeklies:</strong> Volume sales up 23.3 per cent </p> <p>Source: Mintel</p>",

The death knell for Nova was the undignified scramble for readers in the spring of this year. We saw the launch of Warners' InStyle in March and Cond\u00e9 Nast's Glamour in April, both offshoots of hugely successful American titles. If you had taken a stroll along the newsstand of your local WH Smith in April, you would have seen Vogue, with a celebrity style supplement attached to its waist; New Woman, with a free personal organiser; and Nova, with a free novel. Only Marie Claire, with its Bridget Jones theme, was unpromoted. Circulation has over the past few years become more an issue of how much money is spent on promotion than on how good a publication is. Readers go with the gifts, not the magazine. As editors, we can't tell if our magazines are working because sales are so distorted by the freebies. All this competition should be great for creativity: who can secure the best cover, the funniest writers, the most original ideas. But when a free bag is in the offing, even a cover showing a naked Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt would have trouble competing. 'They promoted Nova before they got it right,' said one IPC marketing executive. 'Get your product right first!' InStyle's first cover was a beaming Julia Roberts - an old American InStyle cover shot recycled for the British market. Glamour , too, can use the clout of its giant American sister magazine - and others in the Cond\u00e9 Nast stable - to procure celebrities and stories. Here again Nova was at a disadvantage. At Marie Claire, up against so much American competition, we decided to trust our Britishness - using less airbrushing, fewer Oscar gowns, and more mouthy, homegrown stars of the likes of Geri Halliwell (an issue that sold out, incidentally). But on magazine shelves, which are nowadays all so girly and frivolous, Nova seemed somewhat alien. When the magazine launched, its unique selling point was single-sentence cover lines - for example 'Kate gets personal'. Its cover stars remained unsmiling and moody-looking. But nowadays, when the average time spent choosing a magazine and lifting it off the shelf is about three seconds, the covers make or break a magazine. You need lots of cover lines, and they all have to be compelling. What killed Nova wasn't just its lack of readers - unsurprising when you look at the above - but the lack of advertising. For a fashion magazine, advertising means Milan, home of the big hitters including Armani, Versace, Prada, Gucci and the rest. I remember when I first joined Marie Claire and went to Milan to meet the incredibly svelte, well-groomed and well-dressed women at Prada. I proudly recited the extraordinary circulation figures of the latest Marie Claire. 'Ah, but you are too mass-market. We prefer niche magazines,' I was told. Persuading Prada and Gucci to buy space in Marie Claire took two years; Jeremy was given four issues. It's an extraordinary Catch-22 situation: you need sales for profit and to please some advertisers, but for those all-important labels you also need to be cool and exclusive, using the right photographers and the models of the moment. Nova certainly succeeded there (the gorgeous Karolina is on the cover of the latest and last issue; she was on Vogue the month before). But Nova, like Marie Claire, was handicapped by the Cond\u00e9 Nast stranglehold on lucrative contracts with star photographers like Mario Testino, Nick Knight and Steven Klein. Even young, up-and-coming photographers often won't work for you because they want to hold out for Vogue and that lucrative advertising campaign. Model agents, too, won't let the top girls do a cover before they have appeared on Vogue - and will wait for that chance, even if it never happens. Against such odds, it's amazing Nova lasted as long as it did. Now that Jeremy and I have left the world of magazines to become civilians again, I am reminded of what happened when we were booted out of Mirabella . Having hired Jeremy from St Martin's, I felt very responsible for him. He was sure he wouldn't work in the industry again and I asked him what he wanted to do instead. 'Painting,' he replied. So I hired him to decorate my flat. It took him more than two months because he was so inept. It was only recently he told me he'd meant canvases, not walls.
