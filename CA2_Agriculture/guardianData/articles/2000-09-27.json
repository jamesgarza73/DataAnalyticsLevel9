      "body": "<p>There are few better pieces than Bartok's Concerto for Orchestra to show off technical and musical virtuosity. The BBC Symphony Orchestra's performance of the work marked the opening of their 70th season, and the start of their new association with the Barbican. But with Janacek's Sinfonietta on the same programme - a work that tops even the Bartok for celebratory splendour - it was clear that this was no ordinary curtain-raiser. We were also marking the 75th birthday of the orchestra's conductor, Sir Charles Mackerras. </p> <p>Mackerras's infectious energy creates a distinctive sound in any orchestra. The combination of airy brightness and superbly polished ensemble he produces was ideally suited to Bartok's extrovert concerto. The first movement grew in lyrical, brooding momentum, while Mackerras's fleet-footed tempo emphasised the rustic jocularity of the second movement. The third movement's eruptive nocturne, and the faltering intermezzo of the fourth movement, were also memorably characterised. But the tempestuous momentum of Mackerras's finale left all the preceding movements in its wake. </p> <p>Mackerras is most closely associated with Janacek, however, and his interpretation of the Czech's Sinfonietta underlined his understanding of one of the composer's most demanding scores. Mackerras allowed the phalanx of extra trumpets required by Janacek to generate a suitable sonic superabundance. Yet this spectacular fanfare was only one dimension of his performance. He delineated the sometimes bizarre juxtapositions of mood, texture and melody with unerring conviction.

      "bodyText": "There are few better pieces than Bartok's Concerto for Orchestra to show off technical and musical virtuosity. The BBC Symphony Orchestra's performance of the work marked the opening of their 70th season, and the start of their new association with the Barbican. But with Janacek's Sinfonietta on the same programme - a work that tops even the Bartok for celebratory splendour - it was clear that this was no ordinary curtain-raiser. We were also marking the 75th birthday of the orchestra's conductor, Sir Charles Mackerras. Mackerras's infectious energy creates a distinctive sound in any orchestra. The combination of airy brightness and superbly polished ensemble he produces was ideally suited to Bartok's extrovert concerto. The first movement grew in lyrical, brooding momentum, while Mackerras's fleet-footed tempo emphasised the rustic jocularity of the second movement. The third movement's eruptive nocturne, and the faltering intermezzo of the fourth movement, were also memorably characterised. But the tempestuous momentum of Mackerras's finale left all the preceding movements in its wake. Mackerras is most closely associated with Janacek, however, and his interpretation of the Czech's Sinfonietta underlined his understanding of one of the composer's most demanding scores. Mackerras allowed the phalanx of extra trumpets required by Janacek to generate a suitable sonic superabundance. Yet this spectacular fanfare was only one dimension of his performance. He delineated the sometimes bizarre juxtapositions of mood, texture and melody with unerring conviction. The result was a riotous musical pageant, which encompassed everything from heraldic splendour to bawdy abandon. The concert began with a more recent fanfare: the first UK performance of Harrison Birtwistle's Sonance Severance 2000, written for the reopening of the Cleveland Orchestra's Severance Hall. Although this is barely three minutes long, Birtwistle works out a fully fledged musical process in a series of cumulative, volcanic gestures. Finally, its energy spent after an enormous crescendo, a lone trumpet quietly intones a bare dotted rhythm: a bleak question to conclude this most uncompromising of musical christenings. Mackerras demonstrated his versatility with a performance of Dvorak's Violin Concerto with soloist Pamela Frank. The conductor's rhythmic vitality and Frank's full-toned lyricism provided the most eloquent advocacy for one of Dvorak's more verbose compositions.",

And his theme is the way the sectarian divide in Northern Ireland destroys promise. In the first half we see the triumphant progress of a Catholic boys' soccer club against the lengthening shadows of the 1969 troubles. But in the second we see lives fall apart.

For large parts of the show, the answer is yes. Elton is careful to condemn bigotry on both sides but there is a scene in the second half that conveys an uncomfortable truth about Northern Ireland. As the devious Thomas confronts the recently interned John he announces: \"We aren't trying to win - we're trying to stop the other side winning.\" And that extremist belief that it is the struggle itself that matters, rather than any possible victory, is still sadly with us. </p> <p>Where the musical doesn't always measure up is in trying to dovetail private lives and public attitudes. In the first half the joins are seamless: Lloyd Webber comes up with one particularly poignant song, God's Own Country, where a Protestant and Catholic girl both lay claim to national pride. But in the rebarbative second half, with its killing, and knee-capping, it becomes hard to swallow the climactic romanticism. Lyrics and music turn to mush as we're told: \"There's only one love in the end.\" </p> <p>But, even if the musical falls at the last hurdle, it as at least trying something boldly different, and Lloyd Webber's score, with its echoes of Irish folk and ballad music, is his best since Aspects of Love. Robert Carsen's stripped-down production is also free of that embalming detail you so often find in Lloyd Webber shows. </p> <p>Meryl Tankard's choreography is excellent at conveying the aerial motions of footballing action. And there are good performances from Josie Walker, who has a raw-boned intensity as the deserted bride, David Shannon as the budding soccer star who swaps goals for guns, and Michael Shaeffer as the bespectacled Republican hardliner.

Now the 29-year-old is unlikely to be allowed to do even that with City after Taylor confirmed that putting him on the transfer list was tantamount to exiling him. </p> <p>\"He won't be training with the first-team squad and we'll be talking to his advisers about the whole training situation,\" Taylor said. \"You never say never, especially in football, but I would be surprised if I played him again.\" </p> <p>This latest trough in Collymore's trouble-strewn career follows his bright start at Filbert Street when he scored a hat-trick on his home debut to earn forgiveness from O'Neill for the infamous Fireman Stan escapade in Spain. </p> <p>His current reversal of fortune began with City refusing his demands for a new contract six weeks ago and culminated in a woeful display against Everton on Sunday. </p> <p>\"His performance when he came on as a substitute on Sunday was the last straw,\" Taylor said. \"I felt he could have worked a lot harder and it was totally unacceptable for a professional footballer. I told him that and he agreed. The performance was also out of character for a Leicester City player and meant it was time for me to step in.\" </p> <p>Initially Taylor and Collymore, who had submitted a written transfer request on Monday, agreed to tear up his contract.

      "bodyText": "Stan Collymore found the last chance saloon at Leicester City shut last night when he was put on the transfer list by the manager Peter Taylor and told he was overweight, lacked application and had an inflated opinion of his worth. Taylor chose his words more carefully but his message was clear in describing how the errant striker had failed to put his career back on track at Filbert Street after the former City manager Martin O'Neill gave him the chance. O'Neill took a risk when he signed Collymore who, out of favour with the Aston Villa manager John Gregory, was training with Villa's youth team. Now the 29-year-old is unlikely to be allowed to do even that with City after Taylor confirmed that putting him on the transfer list was tantamount to exiling him. \"He won't be training with the first-team squad and we'll be talking to his advisers about the whole training situation,\" Taylor said. \"You never say never, especially in football, but I would be surprised if I played him again.\" This latest trough in Collymore's trouble-strewn career follows his bright start at Filbert Street when he scored a hat-trick on his home debut to earn forgiveness from O'Neill for the infamous Fireman Stan escapade in Spain. His current reversal of fortune began with City refusing his demands for a new contract six weeks ago and culminated in a woeful display against Everton on Sunday. \"His performance when he came on as a substitute on Sunday was the last straw,\" Taylor said. \"I felt he could have worked a lot harder and it was totally unacceptable for a professional footballer. I told him that and he agreed. The performance was also out of character for a Leicester City player and meant it was time for me to step in.\" Initially Taylor and Collymore, who had submitted a written transfer request on Monday, agreed to tear up his contract. But after Collymore talked with his advisers, who Taylor believes pointed out that the player would continue to be paid if he stayed put, he changed his mind. Now he will remain at Filbert Street until another club comes in for him or until his contract expires in June. It was after a previous meeting involving Collymore and his advisers, Taylor and the City chairman John Elsom that things started to go awry. \"They [his advisers] came in nine days before the start of the season and asked for very, very high wage demands and a new contract,\" Taylor said. \"I thought their timing was poor and the demands were totally unacceptable.

Experts have had doubts about how well social work would survive some of the unions and fresh questions will be thrown up by publication later today of what is forecast to be the most damning joint review of a social services department so far. </p> <p>The report of the review by the Social Services Inspectorate and the Audit Commission of services in the Vale of Glamorgan is expected to lay some of the blame for the department's problems on its merged stucture, with social services and education coming under the same strategic director. It will be sharply critical of neglect of services for vulnerable children. </p> <p>The changing shape of social services departments was recognised by Denise Platt, chief inspector of social services, in her most recent annual report. Over one third of councils had reconfigured their social services departments, she said, linking social services with housing, or social services for adults with housing and for children with education. Outside the town hall, councils are also seeking to mesh services with NHS bodies for older people or for people with mental health problems. </p> <p>Successive governments have been searching for the most efficient and cost-effective way to deliver social services since generic departments were formed almost 30 years ago following the Seebohm report. The present administration is no exception. A raft of measures has encouraged inter-agency work - most recently the Health Act 1999 which created new opportunities for health and social care partnerships by allowing one or other agencies to commission services on behalf of both, the pooling of budgets and merged services. Care trusts, outlined in the NHS plan, will take integration further by assuming responsibility for health and social services. </p> <p>In the days leading up to his retirement, Ian White, outgoing director of social services in Hertfordshire, has been working on an ambitious reorganisation plan for his department. By April next year, the authority hopes to have created a children, schools and families' department, focusing on \"the needs of the child, not on the council's present structures\", says the council. Four multi-professional local teams will bring together staff from social services and education. Services for vulnerable children such as adoption and fostering and residential care will be managed centrally rather than in local teams. </p> <p>White is a keen advocate of merging local authority functions. Over the past 20 years health and social services have struggled to deliver a seamless service, he says. \"Older people have to go to as many as eight different professionals at different sites with different priorities and separate budgets, to get what they need.\" </p> <p>Children with problems are also bounced around between education welfare and mental health professionals, he says. Hertfordshire's plans will change that. \"The parent of a 13-year-old who has started to abscond from school who can no longer cope with his or her behaviour - that parent will be able to go to a single team where psychologists, social workers - all the necessary professionals work together. They will be able to sit down with them and work out a plan. If you put the user at the centre you can cluster the services around them.\" </p> <p>White points out that integrating staff into one-stop teams is very different from appointing a \"super director\" who is in charge of two separate arms such as housing and social services. \"I think you need to drive integration all the way down to organisational level.\" </p> <p>Anthony Douglas, executive director of community services in Havering, east London, is one such super director with responsibility for social services, housing, leisure and benefits and twice as many staff as he would have had as a director of social services. His assistant directors are also responsible for a range of services including homelessness, asylum seekers, leisure and call centres. Children's services has its own assistant director. </p> <p>Douglas believes that authorities which are struggling to deliver the core social services should stay away from complicated structures. \"Where things aren't working it is advisable to stick with a dedicated director of social services,\" he says. \" You have to focus on the basics of the service first.\" People using the service benefit when bosses with social services expertise have got a foot in other camps. \"We can influence functions such as planning so that officers take greater account of the needs of vulnerable people.\" </p> <p>There are drawbacks to controlling several departments, admits one such director, who prefers anonymity. \"There is an issue about how far you are stretched and inevitably you don't have the capacity to stay closely in touch with all the subjects you cover if it includes everything from elderly people to environmental health\". He adds: \"Sometimes the public is confused by the titles. I'm in charge of housing and social services and staff tell me that some users expect social workers to be able to get them another house too.\" </p> <p>Another anonymous director is concerned about the expertise being pushed further and further down the hierarchy. \"I worry when the most senior person who knows anything about child protection is just a principal officer,\" he says. </p> <p>Some authorities have come unstuck with reorganisation. At the end of last year a joint review of Rhondda Cynon Taff, a new unitary authority like Vale of Glamorgan, found its structure was confusing. There was also concern about the level of social services expertise among councillors. Inspectors reported that there were many former district councillors in the present administration, but few former county councillors. As a result, the council was focused on the areas previously the responsibility of the district council rather than functions like social services that were under the county's wing. </p> <p>Critics fear that the status within an authority of social services will be eroded following the merger of local authority functions. But White disputes the fact that only those who have done the job can run the service. \"I was never a social worker and I am the longest serving social services director in the country,\" he says. </p> <p>Whichever way the cake is sliced, the government is concerned to preserve clear lines of accountability. According to the quality consultation paper published in August, wherever social care staff are based, it must be clear who is responsible for the quality of their work and their professional development. </p> <p>And while social services departments may grow into organisations that commission everything from home helps to play equipment, councils must still have a designated director of social services who is accountable to the local authority's chief executive. </p> <p>\"The director of social services must have authority and credibility within a local authority and its partners, and, where activities and functions are dispersed, clear and demonstrably effective lines of accountability must be in place,\" the paper says. Guidance is promised on the role of directors following consultation about what it should cover. </p> <p>The Vale of Glamorgan's review suggests that seamless services do not automatically flow from merged departments. Social work professionals will have to work harder to ensure that internal reorganisations lead to improved services for the public. </p>",

I'm in charge of housing and social services and staff tell me that some users expect social workers to be able to get them another house too.\" Another anonymous director is concerned about the expertise being pushed further and further down the hierarchy. \"I worry when the most senior person who knows anything about child protection is just a principal officer,\" he says. Some authorities have come unstuck with reorganisation. At the end of last year a joint review of Rhondda Cynon Taff, a new unitary authority like Vale of Glamorgan, found its structure was confusing. There was also concern about the level of social services expertise among councillors. Inspectors reported that there were many former district councillors in the present administration, but few former county councillors. As a result, the council was focused on the areas previously the responsibility of the district council rather than functions like social services that were under the county's wing. Critics fear that the status within an authority of social services will be eroded following the merger of local authority functions. But White disputes the fact that only those who have done the job can run the service. \"I was never a social worker and I am the longest serving social services director in the country,\" he says. Whichever way the cake is sliced, the government is concerned to preserve clear lines of accountability. According to the quality consultation paper published in August, wherever social care staff are based, it must be clear who is responsible for the quality of their work and their professional development. And while social services departments may grow into organisations that commission everything from home helps to play equipment, councils must still have a designated director of social services who is accountable to the local authority's chief executive. \"The director of social services must have authority and credibility within a local authority and its partners, and, where activities and functions are dispersed, clear and demonstrably effective lines of accountability must be in place,\" the paper says. Guidance is promised on the role of directors following consultation about what it should cover. The Vale of Glamorgan's review suggests that seamless services do not automatically flow from merged departments. Social work professionals will have to work harder to ensure that internal reorganisations lead to improved services for the public.",

      "body": "<p>Tony Blair bounced back yesterday with an impassioned appeal to the \"basic decent instincts\" of the British people to give him a second chance - and a second term in power - to complete Labour's ambitious modernisation programme.</p> <p>In one of the most important speeches of his career the embattled prime minister told Labour's pre-election conference in Brighton that his government represented the marriage of \"realism and idealism\", in contrast to tax-cutting Tory cynicism.</p> <p>Beset by Conservative gains in the opinion polls, Mr Blair coupled hard-headed electoral calculation with an emotional claim to be a pragmatic and healing leader but also one with an \"irreducible core\" of moral values. It would prevent him getting into a populist auction with William Hague, he promised.</p> <p>There were admissions of error and contrition - on the Millennium Dome and pensions. \"As Gordon [Brown] said yesterday, we get the message,\" Mr Blair said as delegates roared their approval for generous pension rises before polling day - probably next May.</p> <p>To the dismay of fuel protesters he was much less conciliatory towards calls for lower taxes. \"I am listening to people's anger over fuel duties. But I have also had to listen over underfunding in the NHS, over extra investment in schools, over more police on the beat, over public transport,\" Mr Blair explained.</p> <p>And in the passage on which his whole argument turned the prime minister stressed: \"The real world is full of competing causes, most of them good ... it's not an arrogant government that chooses priorities, it's an irresponsible government that fails to choose.\"</p> <p>The speech was punctuated with announcements of new or nearly new plans to improve schools - and school sport, to beat cancer and to give the police the power to \"do as much damage to organised crime as organised crime does to our communities\". It was the speech's one concession to rightwing populism.</p> <p>Mr Blair, who looked relaxed but sweated profusely in the hot hall, said he relished the fight ahead.

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair bounced back yesterday with an impassioned appeal to the \"basic decent instincts\" of the British people to give him a second chance - and a second term in power - to complete Labour's ambitious modernisation programme. In one of the most important speeches of his career the embattled prime minister told Labour's pre-election conference in Brighton that his government represented the marriage of \"realism and idealism\", in contrast to tax-cutting Tory cynicism. Beset by Conservative gains in the opinion polls, Mr Blair coupled hard-headed electoral calculation with an emotional claim to be a pragmatic and healing leader but also one with an \"irreducible core\" of moral values. It would prevent him getting into a populist auction with William Hague, he promised. There were admissions of error and contrition - on the Millennium Dome and pensions. \"As Gordon [Brown] said yesterday, we get the message,\" Mr Blair said as delegates roared their approval for generous pension rises before polling day - probably next May. To the dismay of fuel protesters he was much less conciliatory towards calls for lower taxes. \"I am listening to people's anger over fuel duties. But I have also had to listen over underfunding in the NHS, over extra investment in schools, over more police on the beat, over public transport,\" Mr Blair explained. And in the passage on which his whole argument turned the prime minister stressed: \"The real world is full of competing causes, most of them good ... it's not an arrogant government that chooses priorities, it's an irresponsible government that fails to choose.\" The speech was punctuated with announcements of new or nearly new plans to improve schools - and school sport, to beat cancer and to give the police the power to \"do as much damage to organised crime as organised crime does to our communities\". It was the speech's one concession to rightwing populism. Mr Blair, who looked relaxed but sweated profusely in the hot hall, said he relished the fight ahead. But he was equally anxious to persuade disaffected voters that he was listening to them. He used the word nine times. At one point he said: \"I am listening, I hear and I will act.\" At another he bemoaned \"the fog that descends on the very dialogue between government and people necessary\" to see the ambitious reforms through to completion. As the rest of his speech made brutally clear, Labour's election campaign will hinge on the kind of choices which voters will be asked to make: between investment in public services and \u00a316bn worth of tax cuts un der Mr Hague, between what he called \"confidence or cynicism\". To drive home the choice, he itemised the schools, hospitals, teachers and nurses' jobs which would have to be cut to fulfil the Tory tax pledges. Mr Hague was \"leaping aboard every passing bandwagon\". Mr Blair said Labour would fulfil its 1997 manifesto pledges by polling day and promised delegates \"a second term more radical than the first\" as his cabinet's multi-billion investment plans gradually produced better public services. It was as eloquent a case as he has ever made for New Labour's view of active government, always at hand both to protect the individual and to provide opportunities for fulfilment. But the emotional high point of the 60-minute address was his renewed plea to the wider television audience which has turned against him in the polls to trust him as a consensus-building \"unifier\" - happy to work with anyone for the common good. In a late improvisation to the text Mr Blair also insisted that he had an \"irreducible core\" of principles - and listed the sort of things he would never stoop to in order to win votes. Couched to contrast his own high-minded sense of social solidarity with Mr Hague's appeal to \"narrow self-interest\" and xenophobia, Mr Blair said he would never \"stick two fingers up to horrible foreigners\", exploit the asylum issue, or cut aid to the world's poor. \"I cannot do it,\" he repeatedly asserted. Though he would work with big business and even with Tories to bring about change, the self-styled \"man with a mission\" would not put tax cuts before economic stability or education either. Eager for reassurance that the government was back on track, the conference loved it. After weeks when Labour had been battered by the fuel crisis and punished by falling poll ratings the Blair fightback won him a convincing five- minute standing ovation. Mr Hague called the speech \"the usual New Labour cocktail\" of meaningless statistics, policy failure, unscripted promises and \"apologies that never amount to saying you are sorry\". Today the conference will face both ways on pensions when it backs both Treasury policy and a union-led call to restore the link between the basic pension and earnings. The government will swallow the result by saying the motion calling for restoration of the link proposes this only as one way of increasing pensioners' earnings. The deal was hammered out at a meeting between the leadership and the unions last night. Union sources also said they had been told Mr Brown's pre-budget report would now be published at the end of October. The timing suggests he is planning to make concessions on the fuel tax before the 60 day deadline set by protesters.",

      "body": "<p><strong>HEY, REFER(EE)! LEAVE OUR DAVE ALONE!</strong> </p> <p>The Fiver has dubbed it \"Koogan's first law\" - and nobody who values our national game can afford to ignore it. Simply put, it states that whatever comes out of Kelvin Koogan's mouth always has an equal and opposite reaction. So when Koog recently claimed that David Beckham was now more mature, less petulant and would make a great England captain one day, you didn't need a PhD in reading the tea-leaves to forecast that trouble was around the corner, and just waiting to pounce.</p> <p>Last night trouble finally struck. United were losing 3-1 and the game was drifting into injury time when the supposedly reformed Beckham got himself booked for dissent. But worse still, instead of shaking German referee's Markus Merk's hand and wishing him the best of bully, he then turned and spat on the ground in his general direction! Luckily for Beckham, Uefa aren't going to slap a punitive fine and a long suspension on him for his behaviour. But just in case they were thinking about it, the Imperial Lord Ferg has sprung to the petulant one's defence.</p> <p>The second rule of football - just behind Koogan's first law - is that the Lord Ferg will always, always stick up for his players in public. Well, until he needs to shift a few more units of his autobiography. And today was no different. \"It's understandable,\" said the United boss, talking about Beckham's reaction and not the wild celebrations that took place after United got beat. \"They get frustrated with the referee. The referee is supposed to be at the top of his job - that's the reputation he's got. But we didn't get a lot of help from the referee in protecting the players.\" Considering United's reputation with manhandling referees over the years, can you blame him?</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>ADVERTISEMENT</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.easyshop.co.uk/easyshop/fgf.asp?promo=SU1946LC\">Thinking about lingerie? \u00a310 voucher to use when you spend \u00a330 or more at Easyshop.

Well, when we say 'details', we actually mean that Peter Taylor (he's the new Martin O'Neill!) has been having a right good go. But we're sure you'll be interested all the same.</p> <p>\"There is nothing more important than your football club and there was a person out there on Sunday who didn't give a monkey's about Leicester City Football Club,\" Mr Taylor said today, gloriously resurrecting a phrase that hasn't been heard since, well, since Burnside got the chop. \"I will be totally honest and tell you that the plan I had was for Stan Collymore to start on Thursday [that's the crucial Uefa Cup tie with Red Star Belgrade fixture fans]. But with the way things went on Sunday I don't think it would have been right.\"</p> <p>While the Foxes' many Stanley fans were putting the words \"D'\" and \"Oh\" together, Mr Taylor went on. \"I am fully aware of how popular Stan is with certain sections of Leicester fans and this is the last thing I wanted to do,\" he said. \"They might think that we will lose because he is not playing on Thursday. But I would also point out that we haven't lost a game this season - and Stan has started only one of them.\" And, by the sound of things, it's not just a game he's started.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>IT'S QUOTE OF THE DAY GONE MAD!</strong></p> <p>\"When Villa won the League they did it with 14 players.

He wasn't involved in last night's defeat at home to Milan either, so perhaps it wasn't too surprising when one of the Spanish sport dailies claimed this morning that Barca have been hawking his services to Chelsea, among a host of other clubs.</p> <p>There's no bother though.

      "bodyText": "HEY, REFER(EE)! LEAVE OUR DAVE ALONE! The Fiver has dubbed it \"Koogan's first law\" - and nobody who values our national game can afford to ignore it. Simply put, it states that whatever comes out of Kelvin Koogan's mouth always has an equal and opposite reaction. So when Koog recently claimed that David Beckham was now more mature, less petulant and would make a great England captain one day, you didn't need a PhD in reading the tea-leaves to forecast that trouble was around the corner, and just waiting to pounce. Last night trouble finally struck. United were losing 3-1 and the game was drifting into injury time when the supposedly reformed Beckham got himself booked for dissent. But worse still, instead of shaking German referee's Markus Merk's hand and wishing him the best of bully, he then turned and spat on the ground in his general direction! Luckily for Beckham, Uefa aren't going to slap a punitive fine and a long suspension on him for his behaviour. But just in case they were thinking about it, the Imperial Lord Ferg has sprung to the petulant one's defence. The second rule of football - just behind Koogan's first law - is that the Lord Ferg will always, always stick up for his players in public. Well, until he needs to shift a few more units of his autobiography. And today was no different. \"It's understandable,\" said the United boss, talking about Beckham's reaction and not the wild celebrations that took place after United got beat. \"They get frustrated with the referee. The referee is supposed to be at the top of his job - that's the reputation he's got. But we didn't get a lot of help from the referee in protecting the players.\" Considering United's reputation with manhandling referees over the years, can you blame him? * * * * * * * * * * * * * ADVERTISEMENT Thinking about lingerie? \u00a310 voucher to use when you spend \u00a330 or more at Easyshop.

Well, when we say 'details', we actually mean that Peter Taylor (he's the new Martin O'Neill!) has been having a right good go. But we're sure you'll be interested all the same. \"There is nothing more important than your football club and there was a person out there on Sunday who didn't give a monkey's about Leicester City Football Club,\" Mr Taylor said today, gloriously resurrecting a phrase that hasn't been heard since, well, since Burnside got the chop. \"I will be totally honest and tell you that the plan I had was for Stan Collymore to start on Thursday [that's the crucial Uefa Cup tie with Red Star Belgrade fixture fans]. But with the way things went on Sunday I don't think it would have been right.\" While the Foxes' many Stanley fans were putting the words \"D'\" and \"Oh\" together, Mr Taylor went on. \"I am fully aware of how popular Stan is with certain sections of Leicester fans and this is the last thing I wanted to do,\" he said. \"They might think that we will lose because he is not playing on Thursday. But I would also point out that we haven't lost a game this season - and Stan has started only one of them.\" And, by the sound of things, it's not just a game he's started. * * * * * * * * * * * * * IT'S QUOTE OF THE DAY GONE MAD! \"When Villa won the League they did it with 14 players. You will never see that again.\" John Gregory on how you need a massive squad these days, not Villa's chances of ever winning the Premiership. We think. \"I haven't heard from Kevin Keegan, but I do expect to be in the squad, obviously.\" Age shall not wither Paul Ince's ego, nor custom stale his infinite ego. \"I have only told my dog and she is still in Scotland at the moment.\" Mark Viduka on his personal goal target for the season. But what if she forgets? * * * * * * * * * * * * * HE WAS HE IS WHO? He is He was He is Emmanuel Petit, and to be frank, he might not even be that any more. Yes, the strapping former Gunner with the hair of Perseus, the thighs of Hercules, the left foot of Hermes, and the gob of Dot Cotton, has not been having the best of times since he moved to Barcelona in the summer, and things don't look like improving any time soon. He Was He Is has mostly had to make do with a place on the Barca bench this season, starting only three matches, two of which have ended in defeat for the Catalan giants not renowned for their patience. He wasn't involved in last night's defeat at home to Milan either, so perhaps it wasn't too surprising when one of the Spanish sport dailies claimed this morning that Barca have been hawking his services to Chelsea, among a host of other clubs. There's no bother though. He Was He Is says so. He didn't play against Milan because he was ill (according to his match report on www.emmanuelpetit.com) and, as for the article, it's a load of rubbish. \"I don't know anything about this report. It's a total surprise to me and it's of no importance,\" he said today, with customary modesty. \"Wherever I play I always try to do my job and I'll do everything to stay here and be successful. I'm not the sort of player who gives up.\" Please feel free to insert your own Uefa Cup final/away matches in February joke here. * * * * * * * * * * * * * THE RUMOUR MILL Coventry are lining up a bid for Sheffield Wednesday midfielder Wim Jonk, according to Planet Football. The website says that Gordon Strachan sees the Dutch midfielder as a perfect replacement for Gary McAllister, who moved to Liverpool in the summer. Aston Villa defender Alpay has claimed that Villa Park is only a stepping stone for a move to a better Premiership club. The Turkish international, who scored an own goal in Saturday's 1-1 draw with Middlesbrough said: \"I want to get better and better every day so that bigger clubs will pay attention to me. I want to play for a better Premiership club.\" Sunderland are interested in Espanyol's wing-back Mauro Esteban Navas. However Peter Reid may balk at the \u00a37.22m buy-out clause in Navas' contract. * * * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF Tony Adams has insisted that rumours of his injury problems have been exaggerated. \"The time is right to put the record straight about my fitness,\" he declared. \"There have been a lot of rumours and a lot of talk from people who don't know. My target is clear. I plan to play between 45 and 50 games this season for Arsenal and I hope to add another half-dozen to that with England. Quite simply, I jarred my back. Nothing more and nothing less.\" Carl Cort will be out for the next month after suffering a recurrence of his recent hamstring injury during last night's Worthington Cup tie with Leyton Orient. Liverpool chief Gerard Houllier has told Kevin Keegan that Robbie Fowler is ready to return to the England squad. Houllier said: \"I feel that Robbie is fit although he needs games under his belt. But in terms of fitness, mental commitment and attitude he is ready.\" Mark Kennedy and Phil Babb have been dropped from the Republic of Ireland squad for the forthcoming World Cup qualifying games against Portugal and Estonia. The full squad is: A Kelly, Given, Kiely, Carr, G Kelly, Harte, Staunton, Breen, Dunne, Roy Keane, Kinsella, Finnan, McAteer, Kilbane, Duff, Carsley, Holland, Quinn, Connolly, Robbie Keane, Foley, Delap. Bayer Leverkusen manager Christoph Daum has finally accepted the German national coach job, after appearing to have second thoughts this weekend. Daum said he would sign a three-year contract with the German FA in the next few weeks, and will take up the post at the end of this season. Leicester have had a \u00a3120,000 bid for 20-year-old Irish striker Richie Foran rejected by Shelbourne. \"I don't care that Leicester offered a six-figure sum,\" said Shelbourne manager Dermot Keely. \"I know that a lot of clubs are showing an interest in him.\" Keith Gillespie has been ruled out of Northern Ireland's World Cup matches against Denmark and Iceland because of a troublesome knee injury.

That Lord Archer should be about to make his stage debut in his own play The Accused, in which he stars as a doctor charged with the murder of his wife, only added to the irony. News of the charges emerged just three hours before he was due on stage in Windsor for the final dress rehearsal of the courtroom drama, which opened last night to a full house. Following the meeting with detectives, Lord Archer shunned publicity for this new venture. He looked uncharacteristically subdued when he arrived at the Theatre Royal, which stands in the shadow of the castle walls.

It was Mr Francis's revelations in the News of the World last November that sparked a Scotland Yard investigation and led to Lord Archer's immediate decision to stand down as the Conservative candidate in the London mayoral race. Mr Francis, a former television presenter, claimed the two men had \"cooked up\" a story to help Lord Archer in his 1987 libel battle with the Daily Star, which had accused him of sleeping with Ms Coghlan. According to Mr Francis, Lord Archer asked him to write a letter to his solicitors saying they had dined in a London restaurant on September 9 1986 - the night the tabloid accused him of being with Ms Coghlan. However, Mr Francis's alibi was never used because the paper later changed its evidence to say Lord Archer had been with her on September 8. Last year Lord Archer admitted asking Mr Francis to cover for him, saying he wanted to protect a woman he had been with. \"I realise I should not have asked him to write to my solicitors to that effect,\" Lord Archer said in a statement. \"But the matter ceased to be of any relevance whatsoever when the date alleged by the Daily Star of my being with Monica Coghlan was changed ... a date I was conclusively able to prove that I could not have been with her as they alleged.\" However, further allegations emerged in the following weeks. Misled First Michael Stacpoole, a former confidant and PR adviser to the peer, claimed Lord Archer misled the high court over the state of his \"happy\" marriage. In his summing up to the libel jury Justice Caulfield had described Lord Archer's wife Mary as elegant and fragrant. \"Is he [Archer] in need of cold, unloving, rubber insulated sex in a seedy hotel?\" he asked. Mr Stacpoole also described how Lord Archer gave him \u00a32,000 to give to Ms Coghlan at Victoria station in London, and he claimed the peer paid him \u00a340,000 to leave the country before the trial to prevent him giving evidence. In a further twist, there were claims Lord Archer asked the late theatrical agent, Terence Baker, to provide him with an alibi for his whereabouts on September 8 1986 - the crucial date. Lord Archer strenuously denied the allegation. \"I reiterate that I did not have sexual relations with Monica Coghlan or any other prostitute,\" he said. Scotland Yard began its investigation when the Daily Star made a formal complaint about Lord Archer's alleged behaviour. It was led by Detective Superintendent Geoff Hunt, who was in charge of the 10-month criminal investigation into Jonathan Aitken after the collapse of the disgraced cabinet minister's libel trial against the Guardian and Granada television. \"The timing of the charges was purely coincidental,\" said one Scotland Yard source.",

      "bodyText": "Lord Archer was facing the possibility of a lengthy term in jail yesterday when detectives charged him with lying under oath and alleged interference with important witnesses before his libel trial victory over the Daily Star newspaper 13 years ago. During a 75-minute interview at Wimbledon police station in south-west London, Lord Archer was told a nine-month investigation had uncovered enough evidence to charge him with two counts of perverting the course of justice, two of perjury, and one of using a \"false instrument\" - probably a forged or counterfeited document. Attempting to pervert the course of justice is, in theory, punishable by a life sentence. But if Lord Archer is convicted, a judge would probably be guided by the laws governing perjury, which has a maximum sentence of seven years. The decision to charge the 60-year-old peer delighted Peter Hill, editor of the Daily Star. The tabloid accused Lord Archer of sleeping with the prostitute Monica Coghlan in a hotel in 1986. When Lord Archer won a three-week libel trial, it was forced to pay \u00a31.2m damages and costs. The paper is planning to sue Lord Archer for the return of the money, plus interest of up to \u00a31m. \"We have cooperated fully with the police inquiry and will continue to do so,\" said Mr Hill. \"Whatever the outcome of the criminal case, we will continue to press for the return of damages and costs ... with interest.\" Lord Archer refused to comment as he was driven away from the police station and he ignored reporters when he arrived at the Theatre Royal in Windsor, Berkshire, where he was taking part in a dress rehearsal of his play, The Accused, which opened last night. Lord Archer's lawyers, the London firm Mischon de Reya, also declined to comment yesterday. The peer has indicated he will fight to clear his name, and has retained the eminent barrister, Sir Sydney Kentridge QC.

      "body": "<p>Ask any parent what he or she wants for their child and they will say something about \"being happy\" or \"fulfilling potential\". Ask what is necessary to achieve these goals and you'll probably hear words like \"self-confidence\" and \"self-esteem\". Neither term is as popular in Britain as in the US. Yet new research confirms what has repeatedly been found to be true: self-esteem is a key to successful development and has a far greater impact on future success (and happiness) than intelligence or talent. </p> <p>The research comes from Leon Feinstein's team at the Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics, who have published results of studies on children born in April 1970 which showed a close correlation between childhood self-esteem and adult success. </p> <p>The crucial years seem to be between five and 15, when children learn to assess their abilities and form expectations of success or failure which continue to frame their adult self-image. Parents school them in the importance of coming out \"on top\", while simultaneously they may try to support self-esteem by \"talking them up\". But the combination of pressure to perform and indiscriminate praise may confuse children. </p> <p>It is often difficult to gauge confidence because self-esteem is not simply high or low. In childhood, it undergoes daily shifts in shape and intensity, varying with the familiarity of the setting, the task at hand, the attitudes of the people around. </p> <p>Until about 10, children's daily lives are chock-a-block with discoveries about their abilities, their powers and limitations. They feel confident in one situation, but not in another. They are in control when the school bell rings, but lose confidence when someone is late to pick them up at the school gate. Adults usually only suffer such swings at times of social upheaval. </p> <p>There is no sure method of assessing self-esteem, or measuring the extent to which it is lacking. In the abstract, a child may declare herself confident, say, in maths, but freeze when the teacher invites her to work on a new type of question. Some children boast of being the next David Beckham, yet they don't feel sufficiently confident to join in a game. Dreams aren't any use, unless they give day-to-day support. </p> <p>If asked directly whether they think they can do something, or whether they \"like themselves\", children may speak with a confidence that is not really felt: they learn quickly that they shouldn't be down on themselves. </p> <p>So how can parents judge a child's self-esteem? Some of the danger signals are obvious enough: a child who constantly makes derogatory comments about herself, expresses a wish to die, or speaks pessimistically about her future, is voicing despair over her own self-image. </p> <p>But there are less obvious danger signals too, and these often involve lack of energy or interest in the world. A child with high self-esteem is curious, eager to know, and confident of her ability to understand. One who gives away little personal information may just be reserved - but may feel she has nothing of interest to say. </p> <p>A child who cries frequently when faced with new or difficult tasks is likely to anticipate her own failure and be anxious about her own abilities. One who acts impulsively, or behaves inconsistently, may believe she has no control over the outcome of her actions. Nothing is more important in building self-esteem than a sense of being effective; nothing tears it down as much as a sense of powerlessness. </p> <p>Parents can help. First, they can listen, key into what the child says, and accept her own statements about how she feels and what she thinks. They can help her find (acceptable) ways of expressing her emotions, whether of joy or sadness. Acceptance of her own emotions, and awareness of her parents' genuine wish to understand are important foundations of self-esteem. </p> <p>Secondly, parents can ease anxiety about performance by showing the child that she does have power to extend her skills and knowledge. The important message is that one's abilities and behaviour can improve with effort. If a child does badly in an exam, what reasons does she give? Does she say, \"I'm stupid/ I'm no good at this?\" or does she say, \"I didn't prepare enough/ pace myself\"? The first replies show a belief in failure as permanent and inevitable. The second show that she sees some way of improving her performance. </p> <p>Parents should also be on the lookout for what she says when she does well. If she says, \"It was easy/ I was lucky\", then even experience of success does not build confidence because she does not link it to her own efforts. Children with high self-esteem do not necessarily experience fewer failures than those with low self-esteem, but unlike the latter, they see how they can improve. </p> <p>Third, parents can foster confidence by moderating their own anxiety about performance. The intense involvement parents often have with a child's \"success\" can lead to anger and frustration at \"failure\" to shine. Sometimes, too, a parent's own unhappiness or stress blocks interest in a child's complex inner world. Being ignored can make a child feel she has nothing to offer. </p> <p>While self-esteem can be bolstered in a number of ways - by friends, siblings, teachers, even pets - parents are usually the quickest to respond to need, and so are the first to receive the instructions of pundits. But parents don't have to have perfect control of their own lives to help their children maintain self-esteem. </p> <p>Even if their own self-esteem suffers in the ups and downs of adult life, they retain the capacity to support a child's, for self-esteem involves learning how to survive in the midst of problems. After all, we are aiming at skills that help children to thrive in an imperfect world. </p> <p>\u0095 Terri Apter's The Confident Child: Raising Children to Believe in Themselves, is published by Bantam in New York and available at any internet bookshop.</p>",

In the abstract, a child may declare herself confident, say, in maths, but freeze when the teacher invites her to work on a new type of question. Some children boast of being the next David Beckham, yet they don't feel sufficiently confident to join in a game. Dreams aren't any use, unless they give day-to-day support. If asked directly whether they think they can do something, or whether they \"like themselves\", children may speak with a confidence that is not really felt: they learn quickly that they shouldn't be down on themselves. So how can parents judge a child's self-esteem? Some of the danger signals are obvious enough: a child who constantly makes derogatory comments about herself, expresses a wish to die, or speaks pessimistically about her future, is voicing despair over her own self-image. But there are less obvious danger signals too, and these often involve lack of energy or interest in the world. A child with high self-esteem is curious, eager to know, and confident of her ability to understand. One who gives away little personal information may just be reserved - but may feel she has nothing of interest to say. A child who cries frequently when faced with new or difficult tasks is likely to anticipate her own failure and be anxious about her own abilities. One who acts impulsively, or behaves inconsistently, may believe she has no control over the outcome of her actions. Nothing is more important in building self-esteem than a sense of being effective; nothing tears it down as much as a sense of powerlessness. Parents can help. First, they can listen, key into what the child says, and accept her own statements about how she feels and what she thinks. They can help her find (acceptable) ways of expressing her emotions, whether of joy or sadness. Acceptance of her own emotions, and awareness of her parents' genuine wish to understand are important foundations of self-esteem. Secondly, parents can ease anxiety about performance by showing the child that she does have power to extend her skills and knowledge. The important message is that one's abilities and behaviour can improve with effort. If a child does badly in an exam, what reasons does she give? Does she say, \"I'm stupid/ I'm no good at this?\" or does she say, \"I didn't prepare enough/ pace myself\"? The first replies show a belief in failure as permanent and inevitable. The second show that she sees some way of improving her performance. Parents should also be on the lookout for what she says when she does well. If she says, \"It was easy/ I was lucky\", then even experience of success does not build confidence because she does not link it to her own efforts. Children with high self-esteem do not necessarily experience fewer failures than those with low self-esteem, but unlike the latter, they see how they can improve. Third, parents can foster confidence by moderating their own anxiety about performance. The intense involvement parents often have with a child's \"success\" can lead to anger and frustration at \"failure\" to shine. Sometimes, too, a parent's own unhappiness or stress blocks interest in a child's complex inner world. Being ignored can make a child feel she has nothing to offer. While self-esteem can be bolstered in a number of ways - by friends, siblings, teachers, even pets - parents are usually the quickest to respond to need, and so are the first to receive the instructions of pundits. But parents don't have to have perfect control of their own lives to help their children maintain self-esteem. Even if their own self-esteem suffers in the ups and downs of adult life, they retain the capacity to support a child's, for self-esteem involves learning how to survive in the midst of problems. After all, we are aiming at skills that help children to thrive in an imperfect world. \u0095 Terri Apter's The Confident Child: Raising Children to Believe in Themselves, is published by Bantam in New York and available at any internet bookshop.",

I don't buy into the idea that any unacceptable difference in a child can be put down to a single cause, such as the culture in which they swam until they reached eight cells. While the nurse was out of the room, my boyfriend and I had a whispered argument. I didn't want to put my name to such invasive monitoring; he was worried about seeming obstructive.

I do not expect you even to imagine them. But your child is, and always will be, regarded differently to mine. Among the piles of forms that a couple is asked to sign when they undergo fertility treatment, the one I felt most resistant to was an agreement that any child born through the procedure could be tested at regular intervals, presumably to ensure their \"normality\". I don't buy into the idea that any unacceptable difference in a child can be put down to a single cause, such as the culture in which they swam until they reached eight cells. While the nurse was out of the room, my boyfriend and I had a whispered argument. I didn't want to put my name to such invasive monitoring; he was worried about seeming obstructive. I signed the form. The list for infertility treatment is long, and we were near the top. Anything to please. I resent the fact that my child is not seen as another member of the human race on the long journey to being born, but as the result of, and still subject to, experiment. My nascent child may have spent a few days in a dish, but - however conceived - she or he is just another kid. Contact: leahwild@cswebmail.com.",

      "body": "<p>I'm not proud of this, so I'd better get it out in the open right away. The first time I managed to fit into my jeans after my baby was born, I was so thrilled I wanted to phone someone. Obviously I couldn't think of anyone to call (\"Hi! It's me. I just had to let you know I can do my jeans up!\" \"Oh. Well ... \") but I wore them all week to celebrate. </p> <p>It's not that I had been particularly preoccupied about getting my old shape back after having a baby. I know enough women who are mothers to know it's largely a matter of luck: either everything goes back into place eventually, or it doesn't. No, the problem was boredom. During my pregnancy I wore just three items of clothing, two of them black. And one pair of shoes. I was so looking forward to wearing something different. When I emerged from my pyjamas two weeks after the birth, I realised I still couldn't fit into any of my clothes. I had to climb back into my black, loose-fitting maternity skirt. </p> <p>I avoided the fashion pages of magazines. It's difficult to look at needle-thin women in slinky pedal pushers when you don't know what shape you are any more. Besides, I had no money to buy new clothes - babies are astonishingly expensive - so if I couldn't get into my old clothes I was doomed to flap about in shapeless black. </p> <p>Every so often over the following months I sneaked upstairs and tried my jeans on; no luck. But it was my tummy that got me doing crunches on the bathroom floor - I just got sick of the sight of that bulge (I dreaded people asking me when the baby was due). I think I did 20 sit-ups every morning, and then increased to 30. I lasted for two, maybe three weeks, then gave up. </p> <p>You cannot overstate the depressing feeling that your body's never going to be the same after a baby. Whether it's the debilitating effect of stitches, the huge, painful breasts or the big, loose tummy, sometimes you feel like you're trapped inside an alien. At the same time, you're presented with media images of women looking toned and thin just weeks - no, days - after giving birth. </p> <p>\"Only six weeks after giving birth for the second time... Madonna is already showing off her stunning figure in skin-tight clothes\" drools the Daily Record. \"Cindy Crawford shows off a perfect figure just days after giving birth ... looking her usual sensational self\" trumpets the Sun. The Daily Mail adds insult to injury by praising Cindy for \"spurning painkillers and sipping camomile tea throughout the 17-hour labour\". Patsy Kensit was spotted in a \"slinky size 10\" dress six weeks after having her second baby. The tabloids give out the message loud and clear: glamorous women get back in shape as soon as they're out of the delivery room. So why can't you? </p> <p>Supermodel Crawford puts it even more bluntly: \"For women who may not feel comfortable in their bodies, pregnancy can be an excuse to become Mother Earth.\" </p> <p>You let your body change shape with childbirth? You losers! </p> <p>\"Women are under tremendous pressure to get thin after giving birth,\" says Lynn, a mother of two. \"If a famous person has had a baby, the papers will always mention her weight and shape in the first paragraph.\" </p> <p>For women who tend to worry about their weight, having a baby can be quite traumatic. \"I was worrying about my weight in the hospital ,\" says Lynn, who has battled with anorexia in the past. \"I had a caesarean so I couldn't start exercising immediately. But six weeks later I was at the door of the gym first thing, and putting myself through a punishing schedule.\" She did three hours of aerobic workouts and swimming a week, despite having been very ill after the birth. She's not alone either. Another friend bought a Reebok step after her third child was born, and used it every day, whenever the baby was asleep. </p> <p>Since Lynn's caesarian prevented her from exercising straight away, she tried to cut down on food. This is a major mistake: the consensus is that breastfeeding women should keep up their food intake and eat as much as they want to, which is probably as much as they need. But what use is that sort of advice when you're surrounded by images of Madonna in skin-tight trousers? </p> <p>\"I weighed myself constantly and always had a tape measure to hand,\" Lynn admits. And did the weight fall off? No. Like many women, her weight remained constant as long as she was breastfeeding. She was actually tempted to stop feeding her second baby early so she could shed some pounds. Cindy Crawford's Mother Earth remark struck home: \"Being pregnant is the only time in my life I'm not obsessing about my weight. It's liberating. But you pay for it.\" </p> <p>To minimise the \"pay-back\", Lynn got super-fit before her second pregnancy, and found her recovery time much quicker. \"I was so ill when my first baby was born, I was on a campaign. I was determined to be as fit and muscular as I could.\" </p> <p>Linda Hicks, an ante-and post-natal exercise teacher with the National Childbirth Trust, agrees that the fitter you are during pregnancy, the quicker you'll recover. She believes it's \"very advisable\" for women to start exercising within the first six weeks after the birth, but not so that they can get their trim figure back or squeeze into a slinky size 10. \"They must work on the pelvic floor muscles, on the stomach muscles, and do very specific postural work. If you don't do pelvic floor exercises you'll have trouble holding water, and you'll get to 50 and have prolapses.\" </p> <p>Far from letting it all hang out, according to Hicks, you must start strengthening the muscles you need to look after a baby, to avoid pain and injury. \"Post-natal women are bent over by the weight of huge pendulous breasts. They need to restore strength to the hips.\" </p> <p>The women Hicks sees are more concerned with regaining strength in their backs than flat stomachs, but she agrees that most people are unhappy - for whatever reason - with their post-natal bodies: \"People are shocked not by the fat but by the tone of what's left - a saggy, flappy stomach. If you've got no tone it makes what you've got look worse.\" She advises a regime of \"active and dynamic\" aerobic work and posture exercise. \"Exercise can give women confidence about their bodies.\" </p> <p>Hicks finds many women in a hurry to get back in shape - not so they can look like Madonna or Melanie Blatt, but so they can fit into their trousers. \"Professional women have a timebomb ticking. They have to get back to work, and when they do they will need to get back into their clothes. If it comes to it, it's cheaper to get a personal trainer than to buy a new wardrobe.\" </p> <p>One person I know was swayed by Cindy Crawford's anti-Earth Mother message and actually bought her Get Back In Shape After Pregnancy video. Eliza bought the video two weeks after the birth of her second child, watched it once and never looked at it again. </p> <p>\"It's not that I feel any pressure from others, you just get fed up with being fat, that's all. You're feeling so tired you can't concentrate on losing weight, all you can think is 'My child's screaming and I'm going to eat chocolate to give me energy'.\" </p> <p>Eliza had her second child quickly after her first, so she never had time to lose the weight she'd gained during her first pregnancy. But in spite of leaving Cindy's video in the box, she is getting fit. \"My two-year-old is really heavy, and though I never used to be able to do press-ups, I'm sure I could now: I've got so strong from lifting him.\" </p> <p>Women are liable to put pressure on themselves and feel they have to keep pace with other mothers, and that is when motherhood starts getting seriously stressful. \"Whether it's getting your baby to sleep through the night or getting back in shape, everyone else seems to be doing it quicker,\" says London health visitor Sue Braid. \"But the only way to enjoy the experience is to take it at your own pace.\" </p> <p>My half-hearted attempts to get my stomach flat lasted about two weeks and failed. But about four months after the baby was born I noticed the muscles in my back and arms were beginning to tone up. By this time, of course, the baby weighed a lot, and I was carrying him around in various awkward positions, in his car seat or his chair, all day. Last week I realised I could get up from sitting on the floor, holding the baby, in one move. Now I could never have done that a year ago. </p> <p><strong> The flatpack: Celebrity mums and their tums</strong></p> <p><strong>Cindy Crawford </strong> gave herself 12 weeks to get back into shape after the birth of her son. The supermodel-mom had used yoga to stay toned during her pregnancy but to restore her 34-24-35 figure her Romanian-born personal trainer of 10 years, Radu Teodorescu, devised a strenuous two-hour, six-day a week schedule of workouts. Inspired by envy after seeing a teenage girl in Malibu wearing tanktop and jeans, the 34-year-old Crawford turned her talents to making an exercise video for other new mothers. </p> <p><strong> Demi Moore</strong>, who posed nude while heavily pregnant for Tina Brown's Vanity Fair, also took on a personal trainer to get her figure back. A few months later the movie star was back on the cover wearing nothing but her well-tailored birthday suit. </p> <p><strong> Victoria Adams</strong> denied employing a personal trainer days after having baby Brooklyn by caesarean, but risked swapping monikers with Sporty Spice after reportedly doing hundreds of sit-ups with husband David Beckham. </p> <p><strong> Yasmin Le Bon</strong> was back on the catwalk minus any visible bump within 20 days of giving birth to her daughter Saffron. </p> <p>Model <strong> Rachael Hunter</strong> was posing for a swimwear calendar 12 weeks after the birth of Renee, her daughter by now ex-husband Rod Stewart. </p> <p><strong> Pamela Anderson</strong> and her midriff were spotted on the beach (where else?) a bare seven days after the end of her first pregancy. </p> <p><strong> Catherine Zeta Jones</strong> and Michael Douglas reportedly put off their wedding plans (originally scheduled for the birthday they share, September 25), so that she would have time to get her figure back.

Voting ends today in a three-way membership ballot on the college's presidency, with the incumbent Christine Watson facing challenges from Roswyn Hakesley-Brown and, for a second successive year, Ray Rowden, the high profile NHS commentator, who is promising to shake up \"the closed and elitist culture of the nursing hierarchy\". Next month, voting will close on two highly controversial issues.

And resistance continues to be fierce: at the college's annual congress earlier this year, the move to reopen the issue was passed by a majority of just 5%. But the rise of the healthcare assistant, increasingly taking over less skilled nursing tasks and increasingly holding vocational qualifications, makes the membership question an urgent one. </p> <p>If the leadership wins the vote, to be announced at the RCN's annual general meeting on October 18, it will be a considerable feather in Hancock's cap. And it will undoubtedly prove more significant for the college than another vote with which she is already inescapably associated: the decision, in 1995, to tear up its no-strike rule. </p> <p>\"Never the same again,\" said Nursing Times at the time. But it has, in fact, since been very much the same. The college has not taken any industrial action and there is no prospect of it doing so. Yet the scrapping of the no-strike rule was a stunning propaganda coup that had reverberations across the political landscape. </p> <p>Hancock's use of that issue was much in the mould of her predecessor, Trevor Clay, who transformed what was the original twin-set-and-pearls organisation into the very model of new trade unionism. She came from an NHS management background, though she had of course been a nurse, and had to reign in some of the college's wilder entrepreneurial activity that an ailing Clay had let flourish. </p> <p>The college has, however, always been highly centralised.

Midwives have a long history as campaigners and radicals in the NHS, and in the wider political arena, and Sarah Hipperson embodies that tradition. </p> <p>Hipperson arrived at Greenham in 1983 \u0097 two years after the first group of women set up camp at the Berkshire base, demanding the removal of US cruise missiles from British soil. In the 60s, she had become more and more concerned about the proliferation of nuclear weapons. She became an anti-nuclear activist and visited Greenham when the women\u0092s protest began. After the original group was served a high court order, requiring them to leave, she made her home in a tent at the perimeter fence. </p> <p> She was not the only midwife at Greenham and Hipperson wonders whether her career had anything to do with her decision to protest. \u0093We\u0092re all the sum total of our experience,\u0094 she says. \u0093My nursing and midwifery experience impacted strongly on me and I went on to have five children.</p> <p> \u0093Nuclear weapons were just not comparable with any laws of nature or God. I discovered that if a bomb exploded, all my knowledge would be completely useless. I would have expected in times of war that doctors, nurses and midwives would have a role to play, but if a nuclear weapon was dropped there would be absolutely nothing we could do to help anyone.</p> <p> \u0093I have asked myself why there were so many midwives at Greenham. The whole process of bringing life into the world was part of my life, not just as a midwife but as a woman, whereas nuclear weapons were about the destruction of life. And I think that\u0092s why I went to Greenham.\u0094</p> <p> Hipperson and two other women finally quit the base this month, 10 years after the last US missiles left and eight years after the common was made \u0093redundant for military purposes\u0094. The women achieved their aim \u0097 the 1,000-acre site is now being used for peaceful means and houses a business park and a nature reserve. The women at Greenham were strongly associated with feminism and many midwives believe their radicalism and their desire to change women\u0092s health services for the better are also rooted in this movement. </p> <p> Ella Jackson, a midwife from Brighton, is an activist in the Association of Radical Midwives (Arm), an organisation formed in 1976 by student midwives who shared a frustration with the increasing medicalisation in maternity care. She says: \u0093The Arm does have its roots in feminism. Midwifery is a vocation and we genuinely care about what we are doing. I don\u0092t think you can get into women\u0092s issues without being vocal and committed. Being a midwife is about empowering women to have the kind of labour they want, it\u0092s about giving birth back to women.\u0094</p> <p>In 1993, almost 20 years after the Arm was established, the Tory government launched Changing Childbirth \u0097 a document which promised a root-and-branch transformation in maternity services. The term \u0093woman-centred care\u0094 was born and for the first time a mother-to-be would get the same midwife throughout her pregnancy. Although some mothers and professionals would challenge whether this is the case now, midwives were instrumental in forcing a change \u0097 maternity services were to be run with the wishes of women at their centre. </p> <p>Mary Cronk, an independent midwife based in London, and one of the original radical midwives, says that while it was mothers themselves who were the prime movers in forcing change, midwives quickly joined in. \u0093Changing Childbirth was the consumers and midwives working together to effect change. They said they were no longer going to tolerate things like being shaved and given enemas before going into labour.\u0094 </p> <p>Midwives have always been autonomous practitioners \u0097 a woman can go through an entire pregnancy and labour without ever seeing a doctor if she wants to \u0097 and their title is protected in law. Midwives are also fiercely protective of their professional status and woe betide anyone who confuses them with nurses. One American midwifery website equates the term nurse/midwife with that of \u0093carpenter/ballerina\u0094. </p> <p>This pride in the distinctiveness of the profession may have something to do with the fact that they are referred to as \u0093madwives\u0094 by some doctors and nurses. Jackson says: \u0093When I was a student, \u0091madwife\u0092 was used by some people but people don\u0092t think of us like that anymore. I think we\u0092re accepted and respected. Radical midwives even have dealings with the government as we have been consulted on some policies, such as changes to the UKCC [the nurses\u0092, midwives\u0092 and health visitors\u0092 regulatory body] and primary care.\u0094</p> <p>But in these anti-radical days is there a future for politicised midwives? Gay Lee, a midwife from London and one of the original radicals, thinks it is time that the radicalism which spawned Changing Childbirth took hold again. \u0093Changing Childbirth changed people\u0092s philosophy and woman-centred care became an accepted notion. The problem is we need to establish a service where this can be practised. The midwife is on call, she is providing one-to-one care, so it means that she\u0092s having to do long hours in an overstretched and underfunded service. Midwives are voting with their feet. People are worried about this, but they\u0092re not organising anything collectively to oppose it.

How far it has come in 50 years can be seen in its latest \"campaign\", called People and the planet. The WWF now spends 50% of its budget on human poverty alleviation, it says, and indeed is the only environment group to get a block grant from the Department for International Development.</p>",

Shell will be keeping its head down ahead of the massive court case being mounted in the US by young Ken and other Ogonis. They accuse Shell and its Nigerian subsidiary of aiding and abetting in the torture and murder of Saro-Wiwa senior and other Ogonis, of taking land for oil development without adequate compensation and polluting air and water in Ogoniland and of recruiting the Nigerian police and military to attack local villages. Shell denies the charges but last week a federal appeal court decided the case could go ahead in New York, rather than London where it was less likely to reach the courts. Wildlife wisdom The WWF started life 50 years ago wilfully ignoring people in its mission to save wildlife and was constantly bashed by environmentalists and others who argued that it could not conceivably succeed because animals were vulnerable as long as people were in poverty and environments were in decline. How far it has come in 50 years can be seen in its latest \"campaign\", called People and the planet. The WWF now spends 50% of its budget on human poverty alleviation, it says, and indeed is the only environment group to get a block grant from the Department for International Development.",

And now there is a new proposal to make the centre into \"an authoritative body with freedom to speak out on the misuse of power by multinationals and on the iniquities of globalisation, and to initiate processes of change\". </p> <p>The quarry near Machynlleth has been transformed into a wonderland where you can learn more and have more fun than in the Dome. You arrive in a vertiginous cliff railway powered by water; pee in a recycling loo; call home from a solar-powered telephone; generate your own wave-power; feed farm animals that live almost entirely on kitchen wastes; go down a \"mole hole\" for a worm's eye view of soil; learn how to build your own sustainable house or grow lots of organic food in a tiny space. </p> <p>More than 70,000 adults and children a year visit this unpretentious adventure playground where technical stuff is explained in homely language. Entry for the whole day costs \u00a36.90 - with 50% off if you come on foot or on a bike. Every day telephone inquiries come in from people trying to grow, build and generate power sustainably.

He had the feeling that \"here something new, some fresh and saner way of living might be demonstrated\". Morgan-Grenville, an egregious Old Etonian businessman, then aged 45, had studied American hippies trying out sustainable technologies. \"They were mostly muddled and disorganised, fragile.

Worse, they were bothered by a stream of visitors endlessly asking the same questions.

Then the ferro cement phase - everything made of chicken wire and mortar. Then the heroic-bits-of-kit phase - a wood-gas generator wreathed in curling pipes with a huge silver retort. Now the economics have changed; there's more money to spend and we can look at costly things like photovoltaic roofs.\" </p> <p>Cat has a turnover of \u00a32m and is run by a co-operative of 40 members in which everyone is equal and on the same salary. Paul Allen says the demand for its services has evolved. \"Now it's more of a public policy agenda with organisations like the Welsh National Assembly wanting our help on using sustainable resources. But there are still individuals asking how to re-cycle used chip-fat oil or compost dog poo.\" </p> <p>Allen said the latest report of the royal commission on environmental pollution calling for a 60% reduction over the next 50 years in the UK's carbon dioxide emissions through burning fossil fuels had given fresh impetus to the search for sustainability, and now the petrol crisis \"will set people thinking faster\". </p> <p>Meanwhile do-it-yourself environmentalists can telephone to access Cat's database, call up the website at <a href=\"http://www.cat.org.uk\">www.cat.org.uk</a>, or order publications ranging from a tip sheet on organic ways of combating slugs (40p) or a factsheet on environmental building and water power systems (\u00a32), to a New Futures book on designing a compost toilet (\u00a312). Cat can send you a consultant to build your own house, install solar, wind or water power or set up an environmental exhibition in your museum. </p> <p>Morgan-Grenville, now 70, is still innovating. He is setting up a new network of sustainable communities in the West country. Guest of honour at Cat's 25th anniversary party earlier this month he said it was time to move on. \"In the seventies we aimed to attract attention to the environmental crisis. Since then there's been a seismic shift in the reception of that message but now other problems have loomed and Cat should be at the heart of the solution.\" </p> <p>He said most people still do not realise the extent of the looming global disaster. \"They still assume free trade is a good thing. There's huge public education to be done. I want a centre within the centre - a substantial building with a spiral walkway with bays framing photos and videoclips proffering solutions. We need an authoritative body with freedom to speak out, to tackle the controversial issues and initiate process of change. We're the best qualified body to demonstrate how we could have a better quality of life without ripping off the poor and the planet itself.\" </p> <p>Morgan-Grenville believes Cat could get funding for a new centre that would put pressure on corporations by appealing to shareholders. He feels the new Earth Centre near Doncaster is \"a theme park lacking a coherent message\" while neither Greenpeace nor Friends of the Earth offer a centre where anyone can go to learn. If Morgan-Grenville can sell his latest innovation to Paul Allen, Peter Harper and other members of the co-operative, the Cat saga will only have begun. </p> <p> \u0095 Cat is at Machynlleth, Powys SY20 9AZ; tel: 01654-702400.

      "body": "<p>Before our very eyes, politics is changing for older people. Policy-makers have finally awoken to the enormous importance of older voters, just as retailers now defer to the older shopper. When today's toddlers reach their prime, every third person in Britain will be over 60. </p> <p>There is still the obstacle of ageism to contend with, and old age is associated with stigma, deprivation and loneliness, but there is also a new assertiveness among older people. More and more of them are declaring: \"I can say what I like and I can do what I like.\" </p> <p>After almost 40 years in journalism, half of it on the Guardian, I have spent much of the past 18 months editing a book of older people's views for the charity Help the Aged. I have found that they are not by any means sweet old things who ask for a seat on the bus; they are demanding a turn behind the driver's wheel. </p> <p>In all, I approached about 50 individuals, from old trade unionists to university dons, from a dinner lady to peers of the realm. Their brief was that they should share something of their experience and attitudes of being an older person. They could be humorous if they wished, or deadly serious, or political, or not. It was up to the writer. </p> <p>Some of those approached declined to contribute, but often on grounds that they were too busy or that they did not believe in ageing. In the end, 26 pieces are included in the book, Getting a Life: Older People Talking. A number of the contributors are approaching, or even are well into, their 10th decade, it is good to report, and were typically among the most busy. Baroness Castle of Blackburn, 90 next week, was charming throughout our transactions but at one point bemoaned her lack of a secretary and desk facilities when her workload was so considerable. </p> <p>Lady Margaret Simey - \"just plain Margaret, if you please\" - is already a nonagenarian. I rang her one evening to discuss an unclear sentence and, once we had dealt with that, her voice suddenly changed. \"What on earth has happened to outrage?\" she demanded. \"There is a hell of a lot in this life to be furious about - and not just things affecting older people - and yet everybody seems to be taking it all so easy. We want more outrage.\" </p> <p>Overall, the reassuring theme that emerges from the book is that so long as one's economic situation is bearable, life in the so-called \"third age\" can be rich, sometimes very rich. Mike Banks, albeit an ex-commando, describes vividly how he climbed the Old Man of Hoy in the Orkneys at 67 - and again at 71. Peter Preston, a former Guardian editor, writes of the joy of teaching his three-year-old grandson to use a computer. Pushpa Chaudhary, who fled India after partition, tells of the strength of her Asian community and the richness of her Hindu faith. </p> <p>Yet uncomfortable questions hover in the air. Just how charitable are we towards older people? Whether we give them 75p extra a week to live on, or \u00a320, how much do we care about their often precarious, often ill-managed economic circumstances? When we wave somebody goodbye, as they leave full employment for the last time, how much thought do we give to the sense of loss they may well feel next morning? </p> <p>Or, at a more personal level, just how near are we, in 21st century Britain, to those whom we once called our nearest and dearest? Beyond the dutiful Sunday afternoon cup of tea, how much attention do we willingly give the older members of our family? </p> <p>\u0095 Michael Simmons was born in 1935. Getting a Life: Older People Talking will be published next month by Peter Owen in conjunction with Help the Aged</p> <p> <strong> Margaret Simey</strong><br> </p> <p> Having been recruited by the women's emancipation movement in the 20s, and been an active politician ever since, I was an ordinary member of society running from meeting to meeting just like anybody else. But then some kind but misguided persons laid on a surprise birthday party when I was 90. </p> <p>Until then they had called me Old Indestructible, so I was told, but overnight their behaviour towards me changed. Do you need a chair, dear? Would you like a cup of tea, love? Most cruel of all, whatever would I do with myself now that I was retired? My life as an ordinary citizen came to an abrupt end. </p> <p>As befits my new status as a dependent, I must keep my head down, stop clamouring for a better pension and be grateful for my free bus pass and for concessions when I go into a museum. The whole welfare system seems hellbent on keeping me in what \"they\" think is my proper place. </p> <p>My recent hip replacement had brought home to me my lack of independence. I discovered that a weekly case conference was held to review the progress of myself and all patients on the ward; this would decide when I would be allowed to go home. But I was excluded. </p> <p>When they suggested I should go to a convalescent home, I panicked. I felt that if I agreed that would be the end of my independence. I insisted on going home, and, with the admirable care of community services, I survive. What is so exasperating is that none of this is inevitable. Ageism is a European phenomenon, a comparatively recent by-product of the industrial society. In that context, as non-workers, older people are a drag on the market, of no value, a cost and a problem. Is there no alternative? </p> <p>My answer came from Africa - as wisdom so often does, if only we had the humility to listen. On a visit to my son in Lesotho, I found myself greeted with enthusiasm by the villagers. Pleased but baffled by my reception, I was told on inquiry that what moved them was their pleasure that my son should enjoy the exceptional good fortune of having such an old mother. To them, my experience and wisdom were worth more than money in the bank. </p> <p>\u0095 Lady Margaret Simey was born in 1906. She has lived and worked in the Toxteth district of Liverpool most of her life, including more than 20 years as a local Labour councillor, specialising in police matters.</p> <p> <strong> Denis Healey</strong><br> </p> <p> Personally, I did not notice much change until I was 75. From that age on, I have found my memory deteriorating and my senses getting less acute. I can mistake a reference to \"Stena Sealink\" on television for \"Denis Healey\". I can distinguish between different vowels, but all consonant sounds are the same to me. I can fail to see something I am looking at when it is staring me in the face. </p> <p>There is a saying that when you are old, you either widen or wizen. I have done both.

My eye will automatically compose a clump of flowers or a corner of a landscape in a picture. I enjoy music even more than I used to because I get greater pleasure out of the sound of different instruments. </p> <p>I have become exceptionally sensitive to sunlight, which immediately moves me to pleasure. I use my increased leisure to look at paintings wherever there is a gallery, to enjoy opera and drama at a theatre, to visit country houses.

      "bodyText": "Before our very eyes, politics is changing for older people. Policy-makers have finally awoken to the enormous importance of older voters, just as retailers now defer to the older shopper. When today's toddlers reach their prime, every third person in Britain will be over 60. There is still the obstacle of ageism to contend with, and old age is associated with stigma, deprivation and loneliness, but there is also a new assertiveness among older people. More and more of them are declaring: \"I can say what I like and I can do what I like.\" After almost 40 years in journalism, half of it on the Guardian, I have spent much of the past 18 months editing a book of older people's views for the charity Help the Aged. I have found that they are not by any means sweet old things who ask for a seat on the bus; they are demanding a turn behind the driver's wheel. In all, I approached about 50 individuals, from old trade unionists to university dons, from a dinner lady to peers of the realm. Their brief was that they should share something of their experience and attitudes of being an older person. They could be humorous if they wished, or deadly serious, or political, or not. It was up to the writer. Some of those approached declined to contribute, but often on grounds that they were too busy or that they did not believe in ageing. In the end, 26 pieces are included in the book, Getting a Life: Older People Talking. A number of the contributors are approaching, or even are well into, their 10th decade, it is good to report, and were typically among the most busy. Baroness Castle of Blackburn, 90 next week, was charming throughout our transactions but at one point bemoaned her lack of a secretary and desk facilities when her workload was so considerable. Lady Margaret Simey - \"just plain Margaret, if you please\" - is already a nonagenarian. I rang her one evening to discuss an unclear sentence and, once we had dealt with that, her voice suddenly changed. \"What on earth has happened to outrage?\" she demanded. \"There is a hell of a lot in this life to be furious about - and not just things affecting older people - and yet everybody seems to be taking it all so easy. We want more outrage.\" Overall, the reassuring theme that emerges from the book is that so long as one's economic situation is bearable, life in the so-called \"third age\" can be rich, sometimes very rich. Mike Banks, albeit an ex-commando, describes vividly how he climbed the Old Man of Hoy in the Orkneys at 67 - and again at 71. Peter Preston, a former Guardian editor, writes of the joy of teaching his three-year-old grandson to use a computer. Pushpa Chaudhary, who fled India after partition, tells of the strength of her Asian community and the richness of her Hindu faith. Yet uncomfortable questions hover in the air. Just how charitable are we towards older people? Whether we give them 75p extra a week to live on, or \u00a320, how much do we care about their often precarious, often ill-managed economic circumstances? When we wave somebody goodbye, as they leave full employment for the last time, how much thought do we give to the sense of loss they may well feel next morning? Or, at a more personal level, just how near are we, in 21st century Britain, to those whom we once called our nearest and dearest? Beyond the dutiful Sunday afternoon cup of tea, how much attention do we willingly give the older members of our family? \u0095 Michael Simmons was born in 1935. Getting a Life: Older People Talking will be published next month by Peter Owen in conjunction with Help the Aged Margaret Simey Having been recruited by the women's emancipation movement in the 20s, and been an active politician ever since, I was an ordinary member of society running from meeting to meeting just like anybody else. But then some kind but misguided persons laid on a surprise birthday party when I was 90. Until then they had called me Old Indestructible, so I was told, but overnight their behaviour towards me changed. Do you need a chair, dear? Would you like a cup of tea, love? Most cruel of all, whatever would I do with myself now that I was retired? My life as an ordinary citizen came to an abrupt end. As befits my new status as a dependent, I must keep my head down, stop clamouring for a better pension and be grateful for my free bus pass and for concessions when I go into a museum. The whole welfare system seems hellbent on keeping me in what \"they\" think is my proper place. My recent hip replacement had brought home to me my lack of independence. I discovered that a weekly case conference was held to review the progress of myself and all patients on the ward; this would decide when I would be allowed to go home. But I was excluded. When they suggested I should go to a convalescent home, I panicked. I felt that if I agreed that would be the end of my independence. I insisted on going home, and, with the admirable care of community services, I survive. What is so exasperating is that none of this is inevitable. Ageism is a European phenomenon, a comparatively recent by-product of the industrial society. In that context, as non-workers, older people are a drag on the market, of no value, a cost and a problem. Is there no alternative? My answer came from Africa - as wisdom so often does, if only we had the humility to listen. On a visit to my son in Lesotho, I found myself greeted with enthusiasm by the villagers. Pleased but baffled by my reception, I was told on inquiry that what moved them was their pleasure that my son should enjoy the exceptional good fortune of having such an old mother. To them, my experience and wisdom were worth more than money in the bank. \u0095 Lady Margaret Simey was born in 1906. She has lived and worked in the Toxteth district of Liverpool most of her life, including more than 20 years as a local Labour councillor, specialising in police matters. Denis Healey Personally, I did not notice much change until I was 75. From that age on, I have found my memory deteriorating and my senses getting less acute. I can mistake a reference to \"Stena Sealink\" on television for \"Denis Healey\". I can distinguish between different vowels, but all consonant sounds are the same to me. I can fail to see something I am looking at when it is staring me in the face. There is a saying that when you are old, you either widen or wizen. I have done both. Physically I have wizened; I lost two stones in weight between the ages of 75 and 77. I can no longer run upstairs as I used to do. I find travel very tiring. Psychologically I have widened. I am much more interested in people as human beings and can imagine them at every age from childhood onwards when I see them.

He had already specialised in mental health in Nottingham, where he put in train the closure of one hospital and the rationalisation of another, and continued the focus on Tyneside, becoming chief executive of the former Newcastle mental health trust.

Joyce thinks that is logical and is pleased to reflect on achievement of most of his goals. That afternoon on Milburn's lawn, in 1997, he says he told the newly-appointed health minister (later to become health secretary) he should do three things: merge Newcastle's Freeman and Royal Victoria Infirmary hospitals; achieve integration across the public services as a whole; and appoint more salaried GPs. </p> <p>The first and third have been realised rather better, so far, than the second. And Joyce sees the voluntary sector as playing a crucial role in achieving better service integration.\"There is a range of things that the statutory sector finds it difficult to do, particularly in terms of flexible and speedy response,\" he says. \"If you look at the plans for intermediate care for older people, or 24-hour hostels for people with mental health problems, these are things the voluntary sector is much better placed to do.

It has a budget of about \u00a324m and employs some 800 staff. In terms of profile, it may have suffered in the past from the breadth of its work. </p> <p>Ted Unsworth, the charity's chief executive, expects it to be speaking out more in future. \"Lionel's wide experience, leadership and vision will be a tremendous asset for Turning Point,\" he says. \"His skills and expertise will be a powerful force in helping us to guide and shape our services in the years ahead.\" </p> <p>Joyce has will take the charity's chair in December, when the incumbent Ian Fraser stands down. Joyce intends to speak openly about his own difficulties, having been a member of Alcoholics Anonymous for 25 years and having suffered periodic mental health problems even longer. He spent almost a year as a psychiatric in-patient in 1971 and was, by his own admission, \"very ill\" for almost six months last year. </p> <p>With the support of his wife and three children, Joyce is confident there will be no recurrence of that problem. He looks forward to not only working for Turning Point, but also doing some consultancy work and, he hopes, setting up a mental illness thinktank and an international round table to spread best practice in mental health care.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong> Homes trauma</strong><br> </p> <p> Your otherwise excellent article on the Going for Growth proposals in Newcastle (Street drama, September 13) failed to consider the most serious issue: the way they were explained by the city council to those affected. </p> <p>In the weeks following publication of the draft proposals, my neighbours and I did our utmost to find out what was proposed for our street and how we could play a part in the consultation process. We attended meetings, phoned helplines, read documents and talked to local councillors. Every person we talked to told us something different. </p> <p>It became clear that the people who had drafted the proposals had little idea where our street was, had no knowledge of our community and had not given any thought to the implications of their plans. It was also obvious that the council as a whole was confused about what it was trying to achieve, or how it was going to do it. Nothing I have heard in the last three months has altered my initial impression. </p> <p>It is bad enough that my neighbours and I have no idea if our houses will still be standing in a year's time. What is much worse is that we have no idea what will happen if our houses are demolished. Will people be separated from friends and family? Will we be dispersed across the city? What help will we be given in relocating? </p> <p>Living with these uncertainties every day brings stress that is hard to describe; imagine it was your home and your future. And many of my neighbours live in great poverty and are struggling with problems of drink, drugs, domestic violence, long-term illness or single parenthood. They are among the most vulnerable in the city, the least able to cope with radical change. </p> <p>The city council should be held accountable for the distress and fear it has caused to 4,000 families. If, as your article suggests, this may be the future of inner city development, heaven help council tenants everywhere. <br> <strong>Name and address withheld </strong><br></p> <p> <strong> Unconvincing image</strong><br> </p> <p> The frequently used clog photograph, supposedly depicting unemployment and poverty, doesn't (Risks pay off, September 20). Look at it closely. First, the man. His clogs and trousers are clearly dirty from work. I would guess he was a bricklayer's mate and on his way home. He does look as though he may have visited the pub. </p> <p>Next, the kids. They look healthy and well fed. They have well polished clogs in good condition, ideal for wet Lancashire streets. </p> <p>I hope you can find a more convincing photograph to illustrate similar articles. <br> <strong> Bill Charnock</strong><br> Backwell, Somerset <br></p> <p><strong> Testament to greed</strong><br> </p> <p> I was fascinated by your article on organ transplants from animals to humans (Xeno phobia, September 20). It is indeed a testament to our society's greed and selfishness that the argument for and against xenotransplantation is reduced to a matter of commercial potential versus potential risk of disease to humans. </p> <p>On what basis have we decided that the mass production of pigs for xenotransplantation is morally justifiable? I think that if we considered the matter properly, most of us would find the concept unacceptable. Perhaps, then, this is the very reason that many of us choose not to consider the ethics of this and similar matters in our own minds. Instead, we leave it to governments or to large, influential companies to make moral and ethical decisions on our behalf - which is, at best, naive and, in my opinion, plain lazy. <br> <strong> John Stimpson</strong><br> Thrapston, Northants <br></p> <p><strong> Human rights denied</strong><br> </p> <p> No wonder short breaks (respite care) for disabled children are regarded by parents as life-saving, given the lack of alternatives (Give them a break, September 20). </p> <p>But what do disabled children themselves think? What might they prefer? If asked and allowed to decide, disabled children would opt, not for tea with pretend aunts and uncles in another part of town, but for fun with real friends, in the street, round the corner, in their local school or youth club, or (just imagine) in each others' houses. </p> <p>Of course, disabled children, like their non-disabled peers, need and enjoy time away from home. But whereas non-disabled children have a say in where, when and whom with, this is generally not so for disabled children. </p> <p>We expect carers' research to claim their services are \"invaluable\" and their organisations under-resourced. However, my own work, as well as research by Jenny Morris, shows that the real shortage is in accessible mainstream provision. </p> <p>It further confirms that separating disabled children from their families and peers causes more problems than it solves. It is also a denial of their basic human rights. <br> <strong> Deborah Sowerby</strong><br> disability equality consultant<br> Whitchurch, Bristol <br></p> <p><strong> NHS scrutiny compromised</strong><br> </p> <p> Sir Robin Wales (Letters, September 20) highlights, albeit inadvertently, the weakness of the proposal in the NHS plan that the scrutiny role should be taken on by local government. He writes: \"London boroughs are already working to provide high quality services.\" </p> <p>Well, exactly. So their independence as scrutineers must be compromised. They would be marking their own work. <br> <strong> Joyce Struthers</strong><br> former chairman, Association of Community Health Councils<br> Bedford <br></p> <p><strong> Added terms of acceptance </strong><br> </p> <p> How about adding an item to your terms for acceptance of an advertisement? \"I certify that I have read and understood Graham Hopkins's The Write Stuff\" (September 13). <br> <strong> Robert Polfreman<br></strong> Ormskirk, Lancs</p> <p>\u0095 Write to Guardian Society, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER; or fax 020-7713 4154 or email <a href=\"mailto:society@theguardian.com\">society@theguardian.com</a> Please supply your full address.

      "bodyText": "Homes trauma Your otherwise excellent article on the Going for Growth proposals in Newcastle (Street drama, September 13) failed to consider the most serious issue: the way they were explained by the city council to those affected. In the weeks following publication of the draft proposals, my neighbours and I did our utmost to find out what was proposed for our street and how we could play a part in the consultation process. We attended meetings, phoned helplines, read documents and talked to local councillors. Every person we talked to told us something different. It became clear that the people who had drafted the proposals had little idea where our street was, had no knowledge of our community and had not given any thought to the implications of their plans. It was also obvious that the council as a whole was confused about what it was trying to achieve, or how it was going to do it. Nothing I have heard in the last three months has altered my initial impression. It is bad enough that my neighbours and I have no idea if our houses will still be standing in a year's time. What is much worse is that we have no idea what will happen if our houses are demolished. Will people be separated from friends and family? Will we be dispersed across the city? What help will we be given in relocating? Living with these uncertainties every day brings stress that is hard to describe; imagine it was your home and your future. And many of my neighbours live in great poverty and are struggling with problems of drink, drugs, domestic violence, long-term illness or single parenthood. They are among the most vulnerable in the city, the least able to cope with radical change. The city council should be held accountable for the distress and fear it has caused to 4,000 families. If, as your article suggests, this may be the future of inner city development, heaven help council tenants everywhere. Name and address withheld Unconvincing image The frequently used clog photograph, supposedly depicting unemployment and poverty, doesn't (Risks pay off, September 20). Look at it closely. First, the man. His clogs and trousers are clearly dirty from work. I would guess he was a bricklayer's mate and on his way home. He does look as though he may have visited the pub. Next, the kids. They look healthy and well fed. They have well polished clogs in good condition, ideal for wet Lancashire streets. I hope you can find a more convincing photograph to illustrate similar articles. Bill Charnock Backwell, Somerset Testament to greed I was fascinated by your article on organ transplants from animals to humans (Xeno phobia, September 20). It is indeed a testament to our society's greed and selfishness that the argument for and against xenotransplantation is reduced to a matter of commercial potential versus potential risk of disease to humans. On what basis have we decided that the mass production of pigs for xenotransplantation is morally justifiable? I think that if we considered the matter properly, most of us would find the concept unacceptable. Perhaps, then, this is the very reason that many of us choose not to consider the ethics of this and similar matters in our own minds. Instead, we leave it to governments or to large, influential companies to make moral and ethical decisions on our behalf - which is, at best, naive and, in my opinion, plain lazy. John Stimpson Thrapston, Northants Human rights denied No wonder short breaks (respite care) for disabled children are regarded by parents as life-saving, given the lack of alternatives (Give them a break, September 20). But what do disabled children themselves think? What might they prefer? If asked and allowed to decide, disabled children would opt, not for tea with pretend aunts and uncles in another part of town, but for fun with real friends, in the street, round the corner, in their local school or youth club, or (just imagine) in each others' houses. Of course, disabled children, like their non-disabled peers, need and enjoy time away from home. But whereas non-disabled children have a say in where, when and whom with, this is generally not so for disabled children. We expect carers' research to claim their services are \"invaluable\" and their organisations under-resourced. However, my own work, as well as research by Jenny Morris, shows that the real shortage is in accessible mainstream provision. It further confirms that separating disabled children from their families and peers causes more problems than it solves. It is also a denial of their basic human rights. Deborah Sowerby disability equality consultant Whitchurch, Bristol NHS scrutiny compromised Sir Robin Wales (Letters, September 20) highlights, albeit inadvertently, the weakness of the proposal in the NHS plan that the scrutiny role should be taken on by local government. He writes: \"London boroughs are already working to provide high quality services.\" Well, exactly. So their independence as scrutineers must be compromised. They would be marking their own work.

I jumped in and looked back after about 50 metres and the ship was gone.\"</p> <p>The Express Samina, carrying 511 people, hit the islet just one-and-a-half miles from Paros. The ferry was on the popular tourists' route from the Athens port of Piraeus to the island of Samos. Survivors, including several Britons, described terrifying scenes as they tried to stay afloat and wait for help amidst 35mph winds.</p> <p>Today dozens of anxious relatives gathered at the ferry company offices waiting for news of their loved ones.</p> <p>By 3.30pm today the death toll was 62 and dozens were still missing. A port official also suffered a heart attack and died after hearing news of the sinking. Passengers on board the ferry were thought to include Greeks, Belgians, Russians, Australians, Italians, New Zealanders and Britons. No Britons have been reported dead.</p> <p>British survivor Michael Beaton said: \"As it was tipping further and further over, I was trying to help push people over the railings.\"</p> <p>He told BBC News: \"As it finally went down, I got smashed on the head by a piece of metal and I was trapped under something. I managed to swim out and climb on top of a life raft that was floating upside down.\"</p> <p>Survivor Leona Swart told Sky News: \"We just had to hang on to the rail. It was listing higher and higher and going down the one side. I was just scared that it was going to suck us inside. That's why we decided to go round the end and climb over and hang on to the ropes and just let ourselves go.\"</p> <p>Dozens of fishing boats and other vessels rushed to the scene and helped in the rescue as life rafts and vests washed ashore on some of the island's most popular beaches. The rescue fleet included four British Navy vessels, plus helicopters, on exercise in the area. Rescue efforts were hampered by a fresh gale with winds blowing up to 46 miles per hour.</p> <p>\"The sea state is quite rough. They are continuing to search the cliffs and the sea,\" said a British ministry of defense spokesman.</p> <p>British warships on an exercise near the scene launched three helicopters and rescued at least 12 people from rocks and took them aboard the HMS Invincible for treatment. They were suffering from cold, shock and minor cuts and bruises.</p> <p>\"People were spotted clinging to rocks in the swelling seas and Invincible's helicopters winched them to safety... 12 people, including two Britons, were picked off the rocks and flown to the aircraft carrier to receive medical assistance,\" the spokesman said.</p> <p>Eyewitness Nick Barwis told BBC News 24 he had seen British survivors of the disaster and they were \"OK\".</p> <p>Mr Barwis said: \"There are several clusters of rocks outside the harbour and some of the survivors managed to get on to them. We saw small fishing boats bringing in survivors. In the darkness all we could see was the lights on the lifejackets which meant they had been submersed. Surprisingly, very early on, even with the first survivors, the doctors were saying they were suffering from hypothermia.</p> <p>\"I have been in the hospital all through the night with my wife who is a nurse and clearly that figure (the death toll) is going to rise by some considerable amount. The seas were extremely rough. Late in the afternoon and evening it started to get very windy and some of the ferries were not actually going out in it. Survivors said it went down in two or three minutes and people did not even have time to get a lifejacket.\"</p> <p>Two Britons were among survivors rescued by helicopters from aircraft carrier HMS Invincible. Speaking from Invincible, friends Katrina Wallace from Hertfordshire and Nicola Gibson from Derby said they clung desperately to rocks for over three hours.</p> <p>Ms Wallace said: \"I heard the crack as the ship hit the rock at about 10.30 last night. Luckily I found a lifeboat to get on despite all the screaming and chaos. It was just like on the Titanic I guess.\"</p> <p>She told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"There were about 12 of us in the boat and we saw people jumping off the ship into the sea. We thought we were safe but then we hit a rock, so then we had to clamber on to the rock with waves crashing around us. We were terrified, cold and just waiting for help.\"</p> <p>Nicola Gibson said: \"We managed luckily to stay together even though it was mad with people pushing and very chaotic. When the helicopter arrived we were getting so tired and cold and we thought waves were going to wash us off. We are so, so lucky, so many people have died.\"</p> <p>Coastguard officials could not understand why the 450ft, 4,407-tonne craft hit the Portes islet, which is well-marked. Theoharis Tsoukalas, captain of another ferry, said he made the same run almost every day and could not remember any other ship ever hitting the islet.</p> <p>The Express Samina was one of the oldest ferries in the Greek domestic fleet and had a comparative lack of exit facilities, according to the Greek Island Hopping guidebook, which warned readers against using the ferry as she is reaching the 35-year Greek age limit.</p> <p>The current edition states: \"This dreadful boat is arguably the worst Greek ferry afloat. A large grime-bucket with a reputation for running late, she is definitely a boat to be avoided.\"</p> <p>In August, a hydrofoil belonging to Minoan Flying Dolphins, the largest Greek domestic ferry operator, caught fire between the islands of Aegina and Poros in the Saronic gulf. None of the 69 passengers or seven crew were harmed.</p> <p><a name=\"a\"><b>Useful links</b></a><br><a href=\"http://www.cooksguides.com/gihol_news.html\" target=\"_new\">Greek Island Hopping</a><br><a href=\"http://www.mpa.gr/index.html?page=english\" target=\"_new\">Macedonian Press Agency</a><br><a href=\"http://www.k-english.com/news.asp\" target=\"_new\">Kathimerini newspaper</a><br><a href=\"http://www.paros-online.com/\" target=\"_new\">Paros Online</a><br><a href=\"http://www.ferries.gr/minoan/default.htm\" target=\"_new\">Minoan Lines</a><br><a href=\"http://www.ana.gr/\" target=\"_new\">Athens News Agency</a></p>",

I jumped in and looked back after about 50 metres and the ship was gone.\" The Express Samina, carrying 511 people, hit the islet just one-and-a-half miles from Paros. The ferry was on the popular tourists' route from the Athens port of Piraeus to the island of Samos. Survivors, including several Britons, described terrifying scenes as they tried to stay afloat and wait for help amidst 35mph winds. Today dozens of anxious relatives gathered at the ferry company offices waiting for news of their loved ones. By 3.30pm today the death toll was 62 and dozens were still missing. A port official also suffered a heart attack and died after hearing news of the sinking. Passengers on board the ferry were thought to include Greeks, Belgians, Russians, Australians, Italians, New Zealanders and Britons. No Britons have been reported dead. British survivor Michael Beaton said: \"As it was tipping further and further over, I was trying to help push people over the railings.\" He told BBC News: \"As it finally went down, I got smashed on the head by a piece of metal and I was trapped under something. I managed to swim out and climb on top of a life raft that was floating upside down.\" Survivor Leona Swart told Sky News: \"We just had to hang on to the rail. It was listing higher and higher and going down the one side. I was just scared that it was going to suck us inside. That's why we decided to go round the end and climb over and hang on to the ropes and just let ourselves go.\" Dozens of fishing boats and other vessels rushed to the scene and helped in the rescue as life rafts and vests washed ashore on some of the island's most popular beaches. The rescue fleet included four British Navy vessels, plus helicopters, on exercise in the area. Rescue efforts were hampered by a fresh gale with winds blowing up to 46 miles per hour. \"The sea state is quite rough. They are continuing to search the cliffs and the sea,\" said a British ministry of defense spokesman. British warships on an exercise near the scene launched three helicopters and rescued at least 12 people from rocks and took them aboard the HMS Invincible for treatment. They were suffering from cold, shock and minor cuts and bruises. \"People were spotted clinging to rocks in the swelling seas and Invincible's helicopters winched them to safety... 12 people, including two Britons, were picked off the rocks and flown to the aircraft carrier to receive medical assistance,\" the spokesman said. Eyewitness Nick Barwis told BBC News 24 he had seen British survivors of the disaster and they were \"OK\". Mr Barwis said: \"There are several clusters of rocks outside the harbour and some of the survivors managed to get on to them. We saw small fishing boats bringing in survivors. In the darkness all we could see was the lights on the lifejackets which meant they had been submersed. Surprisingly, very early on, even with the first survivors, the doctors were saying they were suffering from hypothermia. \"I have been in the hospital all through the night with my wife who is a nurse and clearly that figure (the death toll) is going to rise by some considerable amount. The seas were extremely rough. Late in the afternoon and evening it started to get very windy and some of the ferries were not actually going out in it. Survivors said it went down in two or three minutes and people did not even have time to get a lifejacket.\" Two Britons were among survivors rescued by helicopters from aircraft carrier HMS Invincible. Speaking from Invincible, friends Katrina Wallace from Hertfordshire and Nicola Gibson from Derby said they clung desperately to rocks for over three hours. Ms Wallace said: \"I heard the crack as the ship hit the rock at about 10.30 last night. Luckily I found a lifeboat to get on despite all the screaming and chaos. It was just like on the Titanic I guess.\" She told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"There were about 12 of us in the boat and we saw people jumping off the ship into the sea. We thought we were safe but then we hit a rock, so then we had to clamber on to the rock with waves crashing around us. We were terrified, cold and just waiting for help.\" Nicola Gibson said: \"We managed luckily to stay together even though it was mad with people pushing and very chaotic. When the helicopter arrived we were getting so tired and cold and we thought waves were going to wash us off. We are so, so lucky, so many people have died.\" Coastguard officials could not understand why the 450ft, 4,407-tonne craft hit the Portes islet, which is well-marked. Theoharis Tsoukalas, captain of another ferry, said he made the same run almost every day and could not remember any other ship ever hitting the islet. The Express Samina was one of the oldest ferries in the Greek domestic fleet and had a comparative lack of exit facilities, according to the Greek Island Hopping guidebook, which warned readers against using the ferry as she is reaching the 35-year Greek age limit. The current edition states: \"This dreadful boat is arguably the worst Greek ferry afloat. A large grime-bucket with a reputation for running late, she is definitely a boat to be avoided.\" In August, a hydrofoil belonging to Minoan Flying Dolphins, the largest Greek domestic ferry operator, caught fire between the islands of Aegina and Poros in the Saronic gulf. None of the 69 passengers or seven crew were harmed. Useful links Greek Island Hopping Macedonian Press Agency Kathimerini newspaper Paros Online Minoan Lines Athens News Agency",

Her elaborated speech code, and the kind of family life she wants to establish, respond nakedly to pressures for social advancement. In the other type of family - positional families using the restricted code - members have to behave according to their position, older, younger, male or female. The system flourished where social mobility was blocked; speech was used for creating communalised symbolic resources, strengthening community solidarity.</p> <p>Bernstein used examples from the English working classes, the aristocracy, or mil itary families. It was a theory of speech forms responding to two types of social control, one through positioning and one through individualising.</p> <p>The theory fitted Bernstein's own class resentment, which did not help to make it popular. The real stumbling block for the linguists was his favourite word, \" code\". They could talk about language as a code, but not about \"speech codes\". Paradoxically, the critics in socio-linguistics suspected him of bias against the underprivileged, a bizarre perversion of his attitude. Bernstein admired the \" restricted code\", as he called it, for its power, directness, wit, and vivid, dramatic effects. Alas, his own writing is not like this, dense with technical terms, very elaborated. He was also suspected of determinism, cultural or linguistic: a complete misunderstanding.</p> <p>He certainly enjoyed recognition in his lifetime, but the power and originality of his thinking should have made a much bigger impact. He was firing the first shots in a revolution in the social sciences. That the revolution has still not arrived was no one's fault directly.

      "body": "<p>Mr Blunkett began by highlighting a number of important programmes which had been developed since 1997, including Sure Start, literacy and numeracy, the childcare strategy, progress on class sizes and excellence in cities.</p> <p>He then turned to nursery education and primary school improvements. \"With the Tories, there was no commitment to providing more free nursery places. Yet since 1997, we have already provided 120,000 more free places.</p> <p>\"We have introduced Sure Start to give every child a chance of a flying start with \u00a3540m invested directly to overcome generational disadvantage</p> <p>\"We have put childcare at the top of the agenda. More new places in 18 months than in the 18 years of the Tory government - helping 140,000 more children in the last year alone.</p> <p>\"We already have a nursery place for every 4 year old. Today, I can announce for the first time that we will by September 2004 have a nursery place for every three year old whose parents wish it.</p> <p>\"It is of course up to parents of under-fives to decide what they think best for their children, and they may choose not to take a nursery or playgroup place.</p> <p>\"But we are making this investment because we want formal nursery education, from three onwards, to become as much a part of bringing up children as primary and secondary school are today.</p> <p>\"I appeal to parents to take their responsibilities seriously and think what is best for their child - what will help them best begin the process of learning and play, and how important it is for them to arrive at primary school with the confidence and social skills needed to make a good start.</p> <p>\"Education is a partnership in which parents have a critical role. We want them to engage much more in the education of their children than in the past. Their children need it. It can make a huge difference.</p> <p>\"And with the investment we are now making in universal under-five provision, there is no longer any need to wait until five or even four before building the partnership between parents and teachers which is so crucial to a child's success.</p> <p>\"But, conference, don't forget that if the Tories were in office, none of this would happen, because they would cut spending on education. For 10 years, class size rose and pupil/teacher ratio worsened and what did they do about it - absolutely nothing.</p> <p>\"And what have we done? At least 300,000 infants are already in lower class sizes and we expect this term that fewer than 50,000 will be in classes of over 30. That compares with nearly 500,000 left by the Tories - and we will meet our target.</p> <p>\"What is more we have cut class sizes for 7-11 year olds too and reduced pupil/teacher ratios at primary level. There are also more classroom assistants than ever to help teachers out.</p> <p>\"And we have given heads in secondary schools the direct cash to employ the teachers and assistants they need to do the job - if they wish to employ more teachers they can do so.</p> <p>\"It is no accident that there are nearly 7,000 more teachers in our schools this year than there were two years ago.</p> <p>\"Lower infant class sizes come alongside real improvements in literacy and numeracy. In two years, literacy up 10 points, numeracy up 13 points.</p> <p>\"That's a real tribute to our pupils and teachers.</p> <p>\"But it's also the result of investing in training, materials and back up support. The Tories opposed the literacy and numeracy hours when we took the difficult decisions.</p> <p>\"Now they want to stop spending on training and books to back it up. They would sack those who have delivered success. The Tories would kill the literacy and numeracy hours if they were ever given the chance.\"</p> <p>Mr Blunkett continued by talking about the importance of modernising comprehensive education</p> <p>\"We're working on the biggest programme of urban school improvement in generations.</p> <p>\"Excellence in cities is central to raising standards in the most disadvantaged areas. It helps teachers teach with on-site welfare officers. It supports bright pupils with programmes for gifted and talented children. There is targeted help in special zones.</p> <p>\"And there's more support than ever before to improve school discipline, with learning and support units in school as well as a big increase in teachers and places in pupil referral units out of school</p> <p>\"Taken together with practical support to back headteachers, this ensures that they can take disruptive children out of the classroom but keep them off the streets.</p> <p>\"We're improving the career structure for teachers, rewarding good teaching and have introduced training salaries to boost recruitment.</p> <p>\"With a new General Teaching Council, teachers now have a body to promote their profession.</p> <p>\"We have already opened more than 300 new specialist schools - comprehensive schools getting better than average improvements in GCSE results.</p> <p>\"With the announcement by the prime minister yesterday, we will increase the number from just over 500 this term to 1,000 by 2004.</p> <p>\"And look how we've computerised our schools too. Over 20,000 schools connected to the internet this year compared with 6,500 two years ago.</p> <p>\"That's putting modernisation into practice. We're building the schools of the future, where the needs of every child are met and the talents of every child are fully developed.</p> <p>\"Schools where there is the support and the equipment to do the job.</p> <p>\"An education system where children learn the basics and are therefore able to access the wider curriculum.</p> <p>\"One where we've given parents a greater voice than ever before - and opened up the curriculum to them in ways no government has ever previously done.</p> <p>\"Where schools have been failing, we've taken action. Over 500 failing schools have come off special measures since 1997. Others have closed or been given a fresh start. Sometimes we do need to do more - because turning around a failing school is never easy.</p> <p>\"City academies will offer new hope too where inner city schools have been failing.</p> <p>\"But it now takes 18 months on average where it took 25 months under the Tories to turn around a failing school.\"</p> <p>Mr Blunkett turned to spending on schools</p> <p>\"Conference, we've been getting more money to schools. We've got a billion pounds extra direct to heads and will do more with fair funding in the future. And with direct grants of up to \u00a370,000 as well, heads have much more freedom under labour to deliver at the frontline - and that drive goes on.</p> <p>\"We're doing it while spending per pupil rises. \u00a3300 more per pupil since the election after years of Tory cuts. A further \u00a3370 by 2003.</p> <p>\"But we also recognise that there are things which an education authority has to provide. Special needs. Educating excluded children. School improvement and school transport.</p> <p>\"Let people be in no doubt what William Hague and the Tories are committed to do. Not only do they pretend you don't need to pay for these services, they are quite clear that they would abolish school buses. They would scrap them in rural areas. They would scrap them for children with special needs.</p> <p>\"It sounds like the sort of policy that you would need to have consumed 14 pints to come up with.\"</p> <p>Mr Blunkett promised a big increase in capital spending on schools:</p> <p>\"We have been tackling directly years of neglect - the New Deal for Schools is the most effective programme in decades, it is transforming the environment in which teachers teach and students learn.</p> <p>\"Again, as part of the \u00a316bn cutback pledged by the Tories, school investment would go, renewal and refurbishment would go, and of course, the investment in technology announced by the prime minister yesterday would certainly go.</p> <p>\"The difference is we are equipping our nation for a world of tomorrow. We are modernising and reforming for a purpose.</p> <p>\"Our job is to ensure that every school is a good school - that the roof doesn't leak, that the heating works, that the children are warm. That temporary classrooms are replaced, that schools are refurbished.</p> <p>\"11,000 schools have already benefited and, Conference, today I am able to announce from the Spending Review the decisions we have taken on capital investment for the future. \"Four years ago, the Tories were spending less than \u00a3700m a year on capital.</p> <p>\"This year, we're spending over \u00a32bn.</p> <p>\"In three years time, I can announce today, this will increase to over \u00a33bn a year as part of an investment programme of nearly \u00a38bn between next year and 2003.\"</p> <p>Mr Blunkett went on to highlight the successes of the New Deal for the Unemployed, which has helped 230,000 long-term unemployed young people to find jobs.</p> <p>He then announced plans for a big increase in the programme to improve the skills of adults who cannot read or do basic maths.</p> <p>\"We inherited a scandal - millions of people unable effectively to read, write or add up - to read a bus timetable or to understand many household bills</p> <p>\"That was the legacy of poor teaching of the basics which our literacy and numeracy strategies are now beginning to put right. Those who didn't gain these skills haven't succeeded at work as well as they could.</p> <p>\"So I can announce to conference today that we will have a new national Basic Skills Strategy, backed by at least \u00a3150m more spending.</p> <p>\"This will be a critical second term priority for us. Lifelong learning is more than a slogan: we are making it a reality, starting with those who missed out first time around.</p> <p>\"There'll be more money for literacy, numeracy and computer skills. More for teachers of basic skills. More for books - and a new curriculum.</p> <p>\"With a network of 6,000 learning centres being developed nationally, we can ensure that people have access to learning wherever they are.\"</p> <p>Mr Blunkett concluded by highlighting increased investment in further and higher education, including the three-year \u00a3150m package to improve opportunities for bright state school pupils to go to university.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Ah! Jeeves, where's my new-look Daily Telegraph ? </p> <p>There on the breakfast table for you as usual, sir. Just behind the banana and apricot muesli. </p> <p>But I say, Jeeves, what's new about this? The jolly old sheet looks almost exactly the same. </p> <p>Yes and no, sir. In these times of flux and expansion, if I may quote its editor, 'clarity and elegance' become ever more important. We are all searching for a 'cleaner, more open' appearance, with our sections 'better delineated', while simultaneously seeking to make our Comment pages 'sparer and stronger'. The aim, I believe, is to render a well-loved organ more 'attractive and modern in feel while emphasising its broadsheet authority and respecting its well-loved landmarks'. </p> <p>So it's all change, Jeeves, except you're not supposed to notice it? </p> <p>Precisely, sir. Evolution not revolution. </p> <p>Jeeves, is Boris Johnson a well-loved landmark? </p> <p>And that, of course, has been the Telegraph way since Conrad Black first took control. Softly softly no losey monkey. There have been few shrewder holding actions in modern newspaper history. Ten years ago (in August, 1990) the Telegraph sold 1,080,139 copies. Last month, after a vivid decade of price warfare and challenge to its spot on top of the broadsheet heap, it still sold 1,025,027. </p> <p>The dip below the advertisers' magic million, mooted for years, hasn't happened. The pursuing pack, led by the Times , has made up no ground of late. That's a natural cue for modest refurbishment - a tidying here, a touch of paint there. The Telegraph is in no sense broke. It apparently requires only the most modest degree of fixing. </p> <p>What would Bertie Wooster note if he put his monocle in and concentrated hard? Cut-out heads of contributors and interviewees above rather than below the masthead on the front.

      "bodyText": "Ah! Jeeves, where's my new-look Daily Telegraph ? There on the breakfast table for you as usual, sir. Just behind the banana and apricot muesli. But I say, Jeeves, what's new about this? The jolly old sheet looks almost exactly the same. Yes and no, sir. In these times of flux and expansion, if I may quote its editor, 'clarity and elegance' become ever more important. We are all searching for a 'cleaner, more open' appearance, with our sections 'better delineated', while simultaneously seeking to make our Comment pages 'sparer and stronger'. The aim, I believe, is to render a well-loved organ more 'attractive and modern in feel while emphasising its broadsheet authority and respecting its well-loved landmarks'. So it's all change, Jeeves, except you're not supposed to notice it? Precisely, sir. Evolution not revolution. Jeeves, is Boris Johnson a well-loved landmark? And that, of course, has been the Telegraph way since Conrad Black first took control. Softly softly no losey monkey. There have been few shrewder holding actions in modern newspaper history. Ten years ago (in August, 1990) the Telegraph sold 1,080,139 copies. Last month, after a vivid decade of price warfare and challenge to its spot on top of the broadsheet heap, it still sold 1,025,027. The dip below the advertisers' magic million, mooted for years, hasn't happened. The pursuing pack, led by the Times , has made up no ground of late. That's a natural cue for modest refurbishment - a tidying here, a touch of paint there. The Telegraph is in no sense broke. It apparently requires only the most modest degree of fixing. What would Bertie Wooster note if he put his monocle in and concentrated hard? Cut-out heads of contributors and interviewees above rather than below the masthead on the front.

Wellens said the airline would be \"clearly negligent\", if it is confirmed the piece of metal came from the Continental jet. Continental acknowledged earlier this month that the metal piece could have come from one of its planes. However, the airline said today that \"at this stage of the investigation, there is\u0085no conclusive evidence that Continental Airlines is involved in the Concorde crash.\"",

      "bodyText": "Former South African president Nelson Mandela is poised to make his advertising debut as the star of TBWA/London's \u00a3200m advertising campaign for Unicef (United Nations Children's Fund). According to sources, the world's most successful film director, Steven Spielberg, is to direct the high-profile campaign, which will aim to push children's rights to the top of the international agenda ahead of a UN conference next year. TBWA/London won the account after a final pitch against M&amp;C Saatchi in New York earlier this year. A budget of \u00a3200m was mentioned at the time, but the spend has not been confirmed. This is due in part to uncertainties about billing arrangements with the non-governmental organisation. The agency aims to develop a coherent brand for Unicef, including an international campaign targeting corporations, governments and young people themselves. It will aim to change attitudes among industry and government leaders and other opinion-formers. The organisation hopes to galvanise support from academic organisations, charities and industry for the project, which is known internally as the Global Movement for Children. At the time of the appointment in March, Corinne Wood, head of communications at Unicef, said: \"TBWA has demonstrated an acute understanding of the brief as well as an ability to challenge perspectives on children's issues and proven experience of repositioning global brands. A spokeswoman for Unicef in New York said the deals were yet to be signed. She added: \"Those approaches are being made this week. We're working with Mr Mandela on a number of initiatives, because he has the right profile to do this.\"",

      "body": "<p>These are edited extracts from Tony Blair's speech in Brighton yesterday:</p> <p>No prime minister, no party leader, could have a better deputy than John Prescott.</p> <p>You know why the Tories hate him: because he started out as a seaman, steward on a ship, rose to be deputy prime minister and has never hidden or been anything other than totally proud of where he came from.</p> <p>And you know why I like him: because not once in the last two weeks has he reminded me that when he was in charge in August we were 20 points ahead in the polls.</p> <p>For me, the large majority we won was never a reason to do the job quickly; but to do it properly. We knew: first base was getting the fundamentals in place.</p> <p>We said we would sort the economy out. We have. The strongest British economy for decades, delivered by this New Labour government.</p> <p>We said we'd get people off benefit and into work. We are. One million more jobs.</p> <p>We said we'd invest in schools and hospitals. It is happening.</p> <p>And because we chose to invest; because we have in this country tens of thousands of dedicated hard working teachers as determined as we are to give every child a chance to succeed, last week, Britain had the best primary school results it has ever seen.</p> <p>I could go on and on. Because we should be proud of our record. But this is not a time for lists. But for setting out the big choices facing Britain and for dialogue.</p> <p><b> Knock</b><br></p> <p>I'm the prime minister that's supposed to be the great reader of public opinion. After the events of two weeks ago, it's no wonder the government has taken a knock. It happened on my watch and I take responsibility. So: what do we make of it?</p> <p>Three years ago, Britain was desperate to get the Tories out. The people liked the look of us. We were a breath of fresh air. New faces, new ideas, new policies. In some areas we've exceeded expectations. Let us be honest, a few people doubted the economy would be stronger under Labour. But it is. They like the 1m new jobs. They believe we are trying to make progress on schools and hospitals.</p> <p>But for many families life's still a struggle. It's tough, balancing work and family. Jobs can be insecure. There's the mortgage to pay; the holiday to save for. Inflation may be lower but the kid's trainers don't get any cheaper.</p> <p>Then, people hear the 20 second clip on the news. They see the ding-dong at prime minister's questions. They try to make sense of the swirling mass of news and comment in the 24 hour media age.</p> <p>And they think: you're not listening. What's it got to do with me? Where is this journey's end? And a fog descends on the very dialogue between government and people necessary to get there.</p> <p>And, yes, there are things we have done that have made people angry and we should be open enough to admit it.</p> <p>The dome. Hindsight is a wonderful thing, and if I had my time again, I would have listened to those who said governments shouldn't try to run big visitor attractions.</p> <p>75p. I tell you now, as Gordon made crystal clear yesterday, we get the message.</p> <p>But I believe that when people reflect, on the big fundamentals that determine our future - the economy, jobs, public services - we are doing the right thing, and we are on the right track for Britain; and the last thing this country needs is a return to Tory government.</p> <p>Let me come direct to the fuel crisis. I am listening to people's anger over fuel duties. For hauliers and farmers to say nothing of ordinary motorists, there is real hardship.</p> <p>But I have also had to listen over underfunding in the NHS. Over extra investment in schools. Over more police on the beat. Over public transport.</p> <p>I am listening over mortgages, where low interest rates can only be maintained if disciplined public finances are kept.</p> <p>I am also listening to pensioners who believe the government should give them a greater share of the country's prosperity.</p> <p>Our first priority was to help the 2m pensioners, many of them elderly women, who depend on income support. I make no apology for helping the poorest first and neither should this party. Through the winter allowance, now \u00a3150, and free TV licences for over 75s, we helped people with their most pressing costs.</p> <p>We rejected returning to the earnings link. For the next two or three years we could afford it; but 10, 15 years down the line, it would have imposed a huge financial burden on a future generation that would have been unfair to them.</p> <p>But I know there are pensioners not on benefit, who have saved all their lives but are not by any stretch of the imagination wealthy, and for whom the basic state pension and other government help is essential. It is right they share in the nation's wealth.</p> <p><b> Listening</b><br></p> <p>I am listening. I hear. And I will act. The point I'm making is this. The real world is full of competing causes. Most of them good. Most of them deserving. Many of them heart-rending. And it's not an arrogant government that chooses priorities. It's an irresponsible government that fails to choose.</p> <p>The test of leadership in politics is not how eloquently you say yes. It's how you explain why you're saying no.</p> <p>And would it ever be right to choose a priority simply on the basis of a fuel blockade? What of those who can't protest; whose voice isn't supported by the media; who go neglected unless we speak for them?</p> <p>So I am listening. But I was also elected to lead. And if we want to reach our journey's end - that strong, fair and prosperous Britain for all - there are choices to be made.</p> <p>Today the Tories are back with exactly the plan of 10 years ago. You don't need me to predict it. We all experienced it.</p> <p>Don't ever let them con us into boom and bust again. Never forget: in 18 Tory years, unemployment trebled. Families of three generations with nobody bringing in a wage. Record youth unemployment. And what did they say: it was a price worth paying. Unemployment is never a price worth paying.</p> <p>The New Deal has helped nearly a million people with work or training, the largest ever jobs programme Britain has seen.</p> <p>The Working Families' Tax Credit makes work pay for over a million families. Childcare and training has helped 150,000 women find work or get a better job. And at long last a national statutory minimum wage has given 11/2 million people the dignity of a decent living wage.</p> <p>And we have introduced the democratic right, delivered after 100 years of trying, to be represented by a trade union should you want it.</p> <p>That was our choice. Not to leave you at the mercy of markets. Not to walk by. Not to say: tough, sink or swim.</p> <p>There's Mr Hague. Standing around waiting for a bandwagon. Then three come along at once.</p> <p>Opportunism always knocks for William Hague. You want tax cuts? Have them. Spending rises? Have them too. It all makes sense after 14 pints. Everything makes sense after 14 pints.</p> <p>John Redwood looks sane. Michael Portillo looks loyal. After 14 pints, even William Hague looks like a prime minister.</p> <p>Our education, health and transport plans represent the most radical reform in public services over 10 years any government has produced since the war.</p> <p>In our manifesto, line one of our contract with the people promised to increase the share of our national wealth spent on education during this parliament. A promise made. A promise kept. Today I make a further commitment. Line one of the contract in the next manifesto will be a promise to increase the share of our national wealth spent on education in the next parliament.</p> <p>Again, on health, let me set out the scale of our plans, for now and for a second term.</p> <p>The waiting list pledge has been met. There are 10,000 more nurses in the NHS. Every A&amp;E that needs it is being modernised. The biggest ever hospital building programme is under way. But we all know. Eighteen years of neglect isn't put right in three years.</p> <p>Today, as we set out the next steps, I want to focus on cancer. There will be nobody in this hall, or watching from their homes, who has not seen a friend or family member struck down by cancer.</p> <p>Under the plan we publish tomorrow, there will be 1000 more cancer specialists over the next six years - up nearly a third. 295 new scanners and radio-therapy machines so that for the first time the NHS can meet proper equipment standards for diagnosing and treating cancer. By 2003 for the first time the government will be matching pound for pound charity funding for cancer research.</p> <p>Cancer patients in all parts of the country will get the right drugs at the right time, regardless of where they live. The postcode lottery ended. Waiting times will be cut. Maximum two weeks from GP appointment to first hospital appointment for suspected urgent cases. And, as we increase the number of specialists, a maximum wait of one month from diagnosis to treatment starting.</p> <p>And because breast cancer kills 11,000 women every year, because it causes so much pain and suffering among Britain's families, we will extend breast cancer screening to all women aged over 65, helping an extra 400,000 women by 2004.</p> <p>By acknowledging the duty to care, we earn the right to be tough on crime. Four out of 10 violent crimes are alcohol related. Half of property crime drug-related.</p> <p>It is time for zero tolerance of the yob culture.</p> <p>Time to stand up for the pensioner afraid to go out. Time to stand up for the single moth ers scared to walk to the shops. Time to stand up to the thugs and the bullies.</p> <p>Time to tighten bail to deal with the absurdity of people released in the morning committing offences in the afternoon. Time to give the police powers to close pubs where there is fighting. Time to give them powers to ban drink in public places.</p> <p>These are our second term plans. A 10 year plan for a modern NHS. The transformation of secondary education. A cradle to grave poverty strategy. A plan to harness new technology to spread prosperity to all. A plan to make our streets safe and our society strong. A 10 year plan for modern transport. The next steps to full employment.</p> <p>This is a programme worth fighting for. A second term more radical than the first. A quickening of the pace of reform.

      "bodyText": "These are edited extracts from Tony Blair's speech in Brighton yesterday: No prime minister, no party leader, could have a better deputy than John Prescott. You know why the Tories hate him: because he started out as a seaman, steward on a ship, rose to be deputy prime minister and has never hidden or been anything other than totally proud of where he came from. And you know why I like him: because not once in the last two weeks has he reminded me that when he was in charge in August we were 20 points ahead in the polls. For me, the large majority we won was never a reason to do the job quickly; but to do it properly. We knew: first base was getting the fundamentals in place. We said we would sort the economy out. We have. The strongest British economy for decades, delivered by this New Labour government. We said we'd get people off benefit and into work. We are. One million more jobs. We said we'd invest in schools and hospitals. It is happening. And because we chose to invest; because we have in this country tens of thousands of dedicated hard working teachers as determined as we are to give every child a chance to succeed, last week, Britain had the best primary school results it has ever seen. I could go on and on. Because we should be proud of our record. But this is not a time for lists. But for setting out the big choices facing Britain and for dialogue. Knock I'm the prime minister that's supposed to be the great reader of public opinion. After the events of two weeks ago, it's no wonder the government has taken a knock. It happened on my watch and I take responsibility. So: what do we make of it? Three years ago, Britain was desperate to get the Tories out. The people liked the look of us. We were a breath of fresh air. New faces, new ideas, new policies. In some areas we've exceeded expectations. Let us be honest, a few people doubted the economy would be stronger under Labour. But it is. They like the 1m new jobs. They believe we are trying to make progress on schools and hospitals. But for many families life's still a struggle. It's tough, balancing work and family. Jobs can be insecure. There's the mortgage to pay; the holiday to save for. Inflation may be lower but the kid's trainers don't get any cheaper. Then, people hear the 20 second clip on the news. They see the ding-dong at prime minister's questions. They try to make sense of the swirling mass of news and comment in the 24 hour media age. And they think: you're not listening. What's it got to do with me? Where is this journey's end? And a fog descends on the very dialogue between government and people necessary to get there. And, yes, there are things we have done that have made people angry and we should be open enough to admit it. The dome. Hindsight is a wonderful thing, and if I had my time again, I would have listened to those who said governments shouldn't try to run big visitor attractions. 75p. I tell you now, as Gordon made crystal clear yesterday, we get the message. But I believe that when people reflect, on the big fundamentals that determine our future - the economy, jobs, public services - we are doing the right thing, and we are on the right track for Britain; and the last thing this country needs is a return to Tory government. Let me come direct to the fuel crisis. I am listening to people's anger over fuel duties. For hauliers and farmers to say nothing of ordinary motorists, there is real hardship. But I have also had to listen over underfunding in the NHS. Over extra investment in schools. Over more police on the beat. Over public transport. I am listening over mortgages, where low interest rates can only be maintained if disciplined public finances are kept. I am also listening to pensioners who believe the government should give them a greater share of the country's prosperity. Our first priority was to help the 2m pensioners, many of them elderly women, who depend on income support. I make no apology for helping the poorest first and neither should this party. Through the winter allowance, now \u00a3150, and free TV licences for over 75s, we helped people with their most pressing costs. We rejected returning to the earnings link. For the next two or three years we could afford it; but 10, 15 years down the line, it would have imposed a huge financial burden on a future generation that would have been unfair to them. But I know there are pensioners not on benefit, who have saved all their lives but are not by any stretch of the imagination wealthy, and for whom the basic state pension and other government help is essential. It is right they share in the nation's wealth. Listening I am listening. I hear. And I will act. The point I'm making is this. The real world is full of competing causes. Most of them good. Most of them deserving. Many of them heart-rending. And it's not an arrogant government that chooses priorities. It's an irresponsible government that fails to choose. The test of leadership in politics is not how eloquently you say yes. It's how you explain why you're saying no. And would it ever be right to choose a priority simply on the basis of a fuel blockade? What of those who can't protest; whose voice isn't supported by the media; who go neglected unless we speak for them? So I am listening. But I was also elected to lead. And if we want to reach our journey's end - that strong, fair and prosperous Britain for all - there are choices to be made. Today the Tories are back with exactly the plan of 10 years ago. You don't need me to predict it. We all experienced it. Don't ever let them con us into boom and bust again. Never forget: in 18 Tory years, unemployment trebled. Families of three generations with nobody bringing in a wage. Record youth unemployment. And what did they say: it was a price worth paying. Unemployment is never a price worth paying. The New Deal has helped nearly a million people with work or training, the largest ever jobs programme Britain has seen. The Working Families' Tax Credit makes work pay for over a million families. Childcare and training has helped 150,000 women find work or get a better job. And at long last a national statutory minimum wage has given 11/2 million people the dignity of a decent living wage. And we have introduced the democratic right, delivered after 100 years of trying, to be represented by a trade union should you want it. That was our choice. Not to leave you at the mercy of markets. Not to walk by. Not to say: tough, sink or swim. There's Mr Hague. Standing around waiting for a bandwagon. Then three come along at once. Opportunism always knocks for William Hague. You want tax cuts? Have them. Spending rises? Have them too. It all makes sense after 14 pints. Everything makes sense after 14 pints. John Redwood looks sane. Michael Portillo looks loyal. After 14 pints, even William Hague looks like a prime minister. Our education, health and transport plans represent the most radical reform in public services over 10 years any government has produced since the war. In our manifesto, line one of our contract with the people promised to increase the share of our national wealth spent on education during this parliament. A promise made. A promise kept. Today I make a further commitment. Line one of the contract in the next manifesto will be a promise to increase the share of our national wealth spent on education in the next parliament. Again, on health, let me set out the scale of our plans, for now and for a second term. The waiting list pledge has been met. There are 10,000 more nurses in the NHS. Every A&amp;E that needs it is being modernised. The biggest ever hospital building programme is under way. But we all know. Eighteen years of neglect isn't put right in three years. Today, as we set out the next steps, I want to focus on cancer. There will be nobody in this hall, or watching from their homes, who has not seen a friend or family member struck down by cancer. Under the plan we publish tomorrow, there will be 1000 more cancer specialists over the next six years - up nearly a third. 295 new scanners and radio-therapy machines so that for the first time the NHS can meet proper equipment standards for diagnosing and treating cancer. By 2003 for the first time the government will be matching pound for pound charity funding for cancer research. Cancer patients in all parts of the country will get the right drugs at the right time, regardless of where they live. The postcode lottery ended. Waiting times will be cut. Maximum two weeks from GP appointment to first hospital appointment for suspected urgent cases. And, as we increase the number of specialists, a maximum wait of one month from diagnosis to treatment starting. And because breast cancer kills 11,000 women every year, because it causes so much pain and suffering among Britain's families, we will extend breast cancer screening to all women aged over 65, helping an extra 400,000 women by 2004. By acknowledging the duty to care, we earn the right to be tough on crime. Four out of 10 violent crimes are alcohol related. Half of property crime drug-related. It is time for zero tolerance of the yob culture. Time to stand up for the pensioner afraid to go out. Time to stand up for the single moth ers scared to walk to the shops. Time to stand up to the thugs and the bullies. Time to tighten bail to deal with the absurdity of people released in the morning committing offences in the afternoon. Time to give the police powers to close pubs where there is fighting. Time to give them powers to ban drink in public places. These are our second term plans. A 10 year plan for a modern NHS. The transformation of secondary education. A cradle to grave poverty strategy. A plan to harness new technology to spread prosperity to all. A plan to make our streets safe and our society strong. A 10 year plan for modern transport. The next steps to full employment. This is a programme worth fighting for. A second term more radical than the first. A quickening of the pace of reform. The next steps on our journey. All based on our enduring mission, to offer everyone, not just the privileged few, the chance to succeed. Unifier By nature I am a unifier. I am a builder of consensus. I don't believe in sloppy compromise. But I do believe in bringing people together. There is no point in leading the Labour party or leading a country without having a mission and a purpose that's more important to you than anything else. I will do whatever I can to bring people onside but there are certain things I cannot do. If you ask me to put tax cuts before education spending, I can't do it. If you ask me to take risks with stability in this country after all we've learned over the last 30, 40, 50 years - I can't do it. Many of you would agree with that, many of the British people would, but let me tell you some more difficult things I cannot do. If, in order to get a vote, I have to go out and tell people that Europe is full of terrible foreigners, we want nothing to do with them, and we'll stick two fingers up to them, I cannot do that either because in my heart I know it is wrong. I know asylum is a problem. We are trying to deal with it, but if people want me to go out and exploit the asylum issue for reasons of race which we all know about, then vote for the other man, because I will not do it. If I am asked to take that overseas aid budget that helps millions of people who live in circumstances of poverty we cannot even contemplate, and I am asked as the Conservatives do, to cut that budget for tax cuts, I cannot do it. I was not brought in by ideology or policy. I was brought in by that simple and old principle of solidarity, shoulder to shoulder we get more out of this life, and give more in this life, than we do fighting each other as isolated individuals. We are in a fight and it's a fight I relish. We do not lie down in the testing times. We hold firm. We listen and we lead. We can be confident in our policies, confident in the record we will put before the British people. Confident that we will repay the trust the British people put in us. Confident that we share their basic decent instincts and values. Confident that we are winning the big arguments on the big issues. Stability. Or boom and bust. Jobs. Or unemployment. Investment in schools and hospitals. Or cuts. Leadership and engagement in the world. Or weakness and sour isolation. Our journey's end: a Britain where any child born in this millennium, whatever their background, race or creed, wherever they live, whoever their parents, is able to make the most of the God-given ability they bring into this world. That journey, that better Britain of hope and opportunity for all, that better Britain that calls to our best instincts and transforms our nation, I tell you, that journey is a journey worth making.",

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair bounced back yesterday with an impassioned appeal to the \"basic decent instincts\" of the British people to give him a second chance - and a second term in power - to complete Labour's ambitious modernisation programme. In one of the most important speeches of his career the embattled prime minister told Labour's pre-election conference in Brighton that his government represented the marriage of \"realism and idealism,\" in contrast to tax-cutting Tory cynicism. Beset by Conservative gains in the opinion polls, Mr Blair coupled hard-headed electoral calculation with an emotional claim to be a pragmatic and healing leader but also one with an \"irreducible core\" of moral values. It would prevent him getting into a populist auction with William Hague, he promised. There were admissions of error and contrition - on the Millennium Dome and pensions. \"As Gordon [Brown] said yesterday, we get the message,\" Mr Blair said as delegates roared their approval for generous pension rises before polling day - probably next May. To the dismay of fuel protesters he was much less conciliatory towards calls for lower taxes. \"I am listening to people's anger over fuel duties. But I have also had to listen over underfunding in the NHS, over extra investment in schools, over more police on the beat, over public transport,\" Mr Blair explained. And in the passage on which his whole argument turned the premier stressed: \"The real world is full of competing causes, most of them good ... it's not an arrogant government that chooses priorities, it's an irresponsible government that fails to choose.\" The speech was punctuated with announcements of new or nearly new plans to improve schools - and school sport, to beat cancer and to give the police the power to \"do as much damage to organised crime as organised crime does to our communities\". It was the speech's one concession to rightwing populism. Mr Blair, who looked relaxed but sweated profusely in the hot hall, said he relished the fight ahead. But he was equally anxious to persuade disaffected voters that he was listening to them. He used the word nine times. At one point he said: \"I am listening, I hear and I will act.\" At another he bemoaned \"the fog that descends on the very dialogue between government and people necessary\" to see the ambitious reforms through to completion. As the rest of his speech made brutally clear, Labour's election campaign next spring will hinge on the kind of choices which voters will be asked to make: between investment in public services and \u00a316bn worth of tax cuts under Mr Hague, between what he called \"confidence or cynicism\". To rub home the choice he itemised the schools, hospitals, teachers and nurses' jobs which would have to be cut to fulfil the Tory tax pledges. Mr Hague, he said, was \"leaping aboard every passing bandwagon\". Mr Blair said Labour would fulfil its 1997 manifesto pledges by polling day and promised delegates \"a second term more radical than the first\" as his cabinet's multi-billion investment plans gradually produced better public services. It was as eloquent a case as he has ever made for New Labour's view of active government, always at hand both to protect the individual and to provide opportunities for fulfilment. But the emotional high point of the 60 minute address was his renewed plea to the wider television audience which has turned against him in the polls to trust him as a consensus-building \"unifier\" - happy to work with anyone for the common good. In a last minute improvisation to the text Mr Blair also insisted that he had an \"irreducible core\" of principles - and listed the sort of things he would never stoop to in order to win votes. Couched to contrast his own high-minded sense of social solidarity with Mr Hague's appeal to \"narrow self-interest\" and xenophobia, Mr Blair said he would never \"stick two fingers up to horrible foreigners,\" exploit the asylum issue or cut aid to the world's poor. \"I cannot do it,\" he repeatedly asserted. Though he would work with big business and even with Tories to bring about change the self-styled \"man with a mission\" would not put tax cuts before economic stability or education either. Eager for reassurance that the government was back on track, the conference loved it. After weeks when Labour had been battered by the fuel crisis and punished by falling poll ratings the Blair fight-back won him a convincing five minute standing ovation.

Yesterday, for the first time as prime minister, Mr Blair addressed the country with arguments it might not like to hear. He took on the enemies of his project because, for the first time, he had to. It brought out by far the best in him. He emerged for the first time not primarily as a likeable leader, fawning and blurring and charming. There was very little smiling. Here instead was a combative, abrasive, adversarial man only now beginning to deploy on the country the argumentative passions that modernised the Labour party.</p> <p>Going for likeable always was an error. And it did not succeed. The country never did much like the first Mr Blair. When he got into trouble with the petrol blockade, the well of popular affection was found to be as dry as every Esso station. But likeable is not what proper leaders do, as he now seems to have acknowledged. Not before time, the trouble exposed by the opinion polls has summoned the Blairite style into a new and better era.</p> <p>That is not to say the leader has abandoned the spirit of consensus. He knows a concession when he sees it needs to be made. His virtual admission that the Greenwich dome really was a failure makes it easier, despite the shocking scale of the wasted money, to move on. Much more seriously, the new promises to pensioners, in which prime minister and chancellor have finessed their differences, look like being a big advance - quite essential for the most basic reasons of justice and politics alike. \"We get the message,\" he said, rueful contrition written on his face.</p> <p>But otherwise, the speech was as unappeasing as it was uningratiating. It was addressed to a country whose apparent disbelief in him Mr Blair himself cannot believe has any basis in reason or argument. Rather than the party proving itself to the country, one had the sense it was time the country proved itself to the Labour party.</p> <p>Notably unappeased, first, was the business world. For six conferences, Mr Blair has devoted at least a page of his speech to the reassurance of capitalism. Labour as the friend of business was a message he sent equally to the party and the City. In the seventh year, he implied, the mission has been accomplished. Barely a paragraph was directed to that quarter.</p> <p>Instead, it was up to business, and the whole wide world outside New Labour, to understand that this was now the party of government, the party with a project it had only begun. The vibes could not be more different from the nervy hysteria conveyed in those April memos exchanged with the polling adviser Philip Gould. Whether this accurately conveys a solid new confidence inside the skulls of the inner cabal I rather doubt. But the choice has been made, correctly, to show Labour as the party of the famous, unruffled, undeviating long term.</p> <p>Unappeased, too, were blockaders of every kind. Here Mr Blair finally acquired a proper gravitas towards the trouble at the pumps, bringing the country to its senses against people who think their own distress has the right to be expressed by throttling everyone else. He may have touched some easy populist law and order buttons, encouraging the police to break the rules if that is what it took to deal with drug crime. He never has been much of a civil libertarian. But he offered an argu ment and not a peace offering to the haulier heroes of the Daily Mail.</p> <p>He did not concede either, it must be said, to another class of critic, those who accuse him of Napoleonism. Though he no longer seems obsessed with being liked, he has lost none of his appetite for personal power and responsibility.</p> <p>There were mentions of selected colleagues, each with his own graded ranking. Gordon Brown was \"inspired\", David Blunkett was a great education secretary, John Prescott, with whom Mr Blair's personal axis may now be the most telling in the cabinet, the finest deputy a leader could have. Alan Milburn and Jack Straw were mentioned in dispatches. But mostly it was I. \"I am listening. I hear. I will act _ I was elected to lead _ I have my irreducible core.\" Mr Blair remains unashamed as the quasi-presidential figure who once told me, when I asked him if Labour would win the 1997 election, that it certainly would - if only he alone, his uninterrupted voice, was what the electorate heard speaking for the party.</p> <p>This tendency may be regrettable, and is certainly registering a new transitional phase in the history of cabinet government. It has got the leader into trouble, as a control-freak centraliser. One response to that might have been to deflect power and collectivise the project. He is probably incapable of doing that, and thereby still runs a considerable risk. Everything will rise or fall on his performance just about alone. He is meeting this chosen fate, on the other hand, by reverting to the quality that first put him where he is today, which is his appetite for the most direct and unflinching contest about ideas: his ideas, as against those of the Tory party.</p> <p>The thing he got rid of yesterday was the pretence that there can any longer be the search for common ground. Under pressure, New Labour is forced to become a party of argument and battle over a choice about which almost all its members, in the end, have no doubt. The leader is not only the greatest non-doubter, he is also the most complete exponent of a philosophy which he, more than any other person, has raised to the level of religious conviction. Prosperity and social justice. Realism and idealism. Self-interest and common good. Circles and squares.</p> <p>He really cannot see there is any flaw. All he suddenly sees is the terrible possibility that the second term, which is the first time the large rewards will become apparent, might elude him. So he has decided to make the choice on offer much more stark. This is conviction not contrivance. The speech was the least contrived I have heard him give. At the end, everyone saw his torso dripping with sweat. I thought I could see near-tears of fury at the faint chance of the country not agreeing with him.</p> <p>So the battle is joined. The election campaign, on one side, is beginning. Mr Blair lays down a challenge to the Tories. Can they equal his organised conviction? Will they give him an argument? Or do they plan to continue wallowing in the single-issue mud they have been successful in slinging for the past six months? It is a good thing they did it. It gave Mr Blair a necessary fright. But he has set a high standard for the combat to come: one which there is absolutely no sign that William Hague, in his new eminence, is ready to match.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The government cannot understand what has hit it. One moment it is riding high in the polls, then suddenly it is lagging behind the discredited Tories, after a swing in opinion more violent even than that which followed Black Wednesday.</p> <p>A once admired prime minister is hugely distrusted as out-of-touch, over-mighty, uncaring. They can see why they might have fallen from grace: but why so precipitately? And yet there is no mystery, only this simple principle: the greater the illusion, the greater the disillusion.</p> <p>Once upon a time there was a beautiful and adored princess who met with a sudden, tragic and possibly sinister end. In life she had won the hearts of the nation by her openness, grace and compassion for the afflicted. She brought comfort to dying children and moved easily, even lovingly, among victims of Aids, whom many then thought untouchable.</p> <p>Her death left the nation distraught. A field of flowers, each bunch with its tear-stained tribute, was assembled to honour her. People camped on the streets in their thousands to mark her funeral. Some found all this unreal, hysterical even, but they were merely a grudging minority.</p> <p>The royal family into which she had married, who never knew what to make of her, who increasingly had come to regard her as a danger and a disturbance, dissimulated and prevaricated. But Britain's new young prime minister put into faultless words the tribute which the nation wanted to hear. Diana, said Tony Blair, had been \"the people's princess\".</p> <p>And he was the people's prime minister, swept into office by a landslide so staggering that it even astonished him. Wimbledon had turned Labour, and Harrow, and Hove. And the victory was his victory: even his enemies in his own party could not deny it. True, the great triumph was never quite what it seemed. Fewer than one in three of the British electorate had voted for the new party he had designed and created. He had fewer votes behind him than John Major five years before.</p> <p>But if there were reservations they attached themselves to Labour rather than to its leader. Soon his popularity was breaking all records: his approval ratings at one point topped 90%. What people thought about Labour no longer mattered, for Tony Blair transcended all that. Here was man who was set to take the politics out of politics.</p> <p>The views of the party he led did not seem to concern him greatly. He would listen to the people - all the people - discern what they wanted, and see that they got it, regardless of party doctrine. Some found all this unreal, hysterical even, but they were merely a grudging minority.</p> <p>But the princess herself was not what she seemed. Or more precisely, she <i>was</i> what she seemed, but was other things as well. One day her suffering private secretary would write what he had learned to his cost: that twinned with the generosity and the compassion there was fickleness and mean-spiritedness and malevolence.

      "bodyText": "The government cannot understand what has hit it. One moment it is riding high in the polls, then suddenly it is lagging behind the discredited Tories, after a swing in opinion more violent even than that which followed Black Wednesday. A once admired prime minister is hugely distrusted as out-of-touch, over-mighty, uncaring. They can see why they might have fallen from grace: but why so precipitately? And yet there is no mystery, only this simple principle: the greater the illusion, the greater the disillusion. Once upon a time there was a beautiful and adored princess who met with a sudden, tragic and possibly sinister end. In life she had won the hearts of the nation by her openness, grace and compassion for the afflicted. She brought comfort to dying children and moved easily, even lovingly, among victims of Aids, whom many then thought untouchable. Her death left the nation distraught. A field of flowers, each bunch with its tear-stained tribute, was assembled to honour her. People camped on the streets in their thousands to mark her funeral. Some found all this unreal, hysterical even, but they were merely a grudging minority. The royal family into which she had married, who never knew what to make of her, who increasingly had come to regard her as a danger and a disturbance, dissimulated and prevaricated. But Britain's new young prime minister put into faultless words the tribute which the nation wanted to hear. Diana, said Tony Blair, had been \"the people's princess\". And he was the people's prime minister, swept into office by a landslide so staggering that it even astonished him. Wimbledon had turned Labour, and Harrow, and Hove. And the victory was his victory: even his enemies in his own party could not deny it. True, the great triumph was never quite what it seemed. Fewer than one in three of the British electorate had voted for the new party he had designed and created. He had fewer votes behind him than John Major five years before. But if there were reservations they attached themselves to Labour rather than to its leader. Soon his popularity was breaking all records: his approval ratings at one point topped 90%. What people thought about Labour no longer mattered, for Tony Blair transcended all that. Here was man who was set to take the politics out of politics. The views of the party he led did not seem to concern him greatly. He would listen to the people - all the people - discern what they wanted, and see that they got it, regardless of party doctrine. Some found all this unreal, hysterical even, but they were merely a grudging minority. But the princess herself was not what she seemed. Or more precisely, she was what she seemed, but was other things as well. One day her suffering private secretary would write what he had learned to his cost: that twinned with the generosity and the compassion there was fickleness and mean-spiritedness and malevolence. Persecuted herself, she increasingly turned to the persecution of others. Much of that sprang from an overwhelming sense of rejection. But it made her impossible. A little of that was perceived at the time, but it never became the people's sense of her. Had she lived, had she grown more bitter with time, it could not have been disguised. Then there would have been disillusion. But the people's prime minister too was not what he seemed; or to be more precise, events and the nature of politics made that impossible. To govern, said Pierre Mend\u00e8s-France, another political icon who fell from grace, is to choose; and that sometimes means choosing hard and unpopular options. The people wanted Ken Livingstone and Rhodri Morgan; Blair feared them and tried to stop them. The people wanted Mo Mowlam; Blair exiled her to the margins.

Even where the majority of the population are now below the poverty line, as in Kyrgyzstan or Tajikistan (60 and 70 per cent respectively by conservative estimates) , most benefits are quite strictly targeted to very poor families and individuals. Food and fuel subsidies have been scaled down or eliminated. Benefit levels have been eroded due to inflation and are often very low - in Tajikistan in 1999, the monthly cash benefit for low income families was only sufficient to buy two loaves of bread . Furthermore, in some countries anybody with a plot of land over a certain size is ineligible for income support benefits - even where these plots are too small to make a living. Due to irregular state revenues, benefits are often paid late - and in Kyrgyzstan, sometimes in kind. These problems and complex application procedures put off many poor applicants. As a result, often only a relatively small proportion of the population take up the benefits for which they are eligible . Nonetheless, benefits appear an important source of support for those who do receive them.</p> <p>Extended families and communities are often the principal source of support to poor or vulnerable individuals and have played a vital role in preventing destitution over the transition period. However, due to unemployment, and lack of assets, many families are under great stress and struggle to support one another. In the words of one Kyrgyz man \"having relatives is expensive these days\". In parts of Eastern Europe, pressure on families is so acute that the percentage of children living in institutional care has risen 45 per cent in Romania and Russia and 75 per cent in Latvia since 1991. </p> <p><strong>Recommendations:</strong> </p> <p>The World Bank Asian Development Bank and other donors are putting increasing emphasis on social protection, including adequate safety nets. We believe that adequate social protection will require some significant changes to current approaches: </p> <p>1: A more holistic approach. At present, poverty issues are often depoliticised and compartmentalised. Most aid has focused on technical assistance for restructuring parts of the safety net, often broadly in a Western model. This is often disconnected from wider debate on the role of donor-sponsored or mandated economic policies in creating poverty, how poverty should be tackled, and what might constitute an appropriate safety net. This tunnel vision may help explain how radical changes to almost all aspects of social and economic life could be implemented simultaneously, underestimating the social costs. For example in Kyrgyzstan, due to the devaluations, collapse of state-owned enterprises and inequitable privatisation, in the space of a few years, millions were plunged into poverty, formerly universal cash benefits were removed, or re-targeted to the very poor, food and fuel subsidies were cut and people were suddenly asked to pay for health care, pre-school and university education, to contribute to school running costs, and the pension fund, and to pay land and water taxes. In the words of one rural pre-school teacher, a mother of four, 'we have to pay for everything now - and everything is expensive'. </p> <p>2: Greater emphasis on damage prevention. Much WB and donor involvement, particularly in the early 1990s when poverty was increasing fastest, focused on cost-containment, at the expense of social protection. Now social protection is back on the agenda, but for many poor people the damage has been done, as notable increases in child malnutrition and reductions in school enrolment in Central Asia make clear. Serious attention to social protection is needed to reverse these trends.</p> <p>3: Social funds (SFs). The World Bank has introduced stand-alone SFs (anti poverty or community investment programmes) in Mongolia, South East Europe and the Caucasus. While many of the activities supported by SFs are useful, the funds are usually too small and their activities too patchy to have a significant impact. </p> <p>4: A fundamental rethink of how to protect poor and vulnerable people is needed. This will necessitate debate on a range of models, rather than restructuring social protection everywhere in line with the very low state provision of the American model. How this can be financed in the medium to long-term must be discussed.

      "bodyText": "Pop icon Sir Elton John is all set to make a \u00a330m animated film, according to the Daily Express today. The singer, who says that the music industry has become a \"boring grind\" for him, is to base the story around garden gnomes - apparently a subject very close to his heart. The multi-millionaire will make the film through his film production company, Rocket Pictures, which he owns with his boyfriend David Furnish. Disney has already agreed to give the film its backing due to the enormous Stateside success of the British animated film Chicken Run. Sir Elton, who won an Oscar for providing the music to Disney's 1994 animated smash hit The Lion King, is reportedly keen to get involved in all aspects of the film-making process.",

      "body": "<p>Tiredness crept in like a warm blanket <br>And suffocated me in sleep <br>My bones ached, my mind was tired <br>My will, my motivation, both weak. </p> <p>Tom Bidwell's eyes are shadowed in grey and he is still skinny. But not as skinny as he used to be. He is up to seven stone. It's progress; a couple of years ago he was half a foot smaller and a stone heavier. </p> <p>Tom, now 16, is recovering from cancer of the lymph glands. He has been through chemotherapy, radiotherapy and a bone-marrow transplant, and he has popped more pills than most people will hope to see in a lifetime. </p> <p>And alongside all the conventional medicines, he has discovered his own form of complementary therapy - writing. It would be an exaggeration to say that Tom has written his way back to good health, but his writing has certainly helped. There are poems of anger, poems of love and loss, poems of tears and fears, poems of entrapment. </p> <p>I don't wanna die, Mum, <br>Don't wanna have to cry, Mum <br>Don't wanna ask why, Mum <br>But why?<br> <br>I just feel so bad, Mum <br>It hurts to see you sad, Mum <br>Not strong enough to get mad, Mum <br>Not strong</p> <p> We'll make it through the grey, Mum <br>Tomorrow's another day, Mum <br>I love you more than I can say, Mum <br>Love you </p> <p>Tom's mum and dad meet me at Preston station. Jack is a big, brawny Lancastrian who you just know must have been a no-nonsense centre back in his day. Barbara is smart and petite, a dead ringer for Sheila Grant. They talk about Tom with pride and tenderness. </p> <p>I get a strange deja vu when I meet Tom. When I was a child, I was also ill and watched the weeks in darkness turn into months, and the months turn into years. Like Tom, I had a serious illness (encephalitis), and like Tom, I turned to poetry. Both of us had a precocious sense of the darkness in life, and both of us ripped off the Beatles mercilessly. </p> <p>When Tom first went to the doctor, aged 14, he was told he had a pulled muscle and that he should exercise more. \"The next day I tried to shave my brother's head with a razor and the vibrations made me pass out.\" He went back to the doctor, who told him he had been standing on the streets for too long and had caught a cold. At which point Barbara called for a second opinion. Tom says it was January 5 1999 when he was diagnosed with cancer. You don't forget dates like that. </p> <p>He shows off the contours of his illness. There are numerous scars, reminders of all those tubes and needles - lumbar punctures, biopsies, thoracotomies. Tom became bitter, resentful. He would ask a question to which there was no answer: what have I done to deserve such pain? Tom became estranged from his friends and lost his faith in God. </p> <p>As well as his poetry he kept a diary. In February 1999 he wrote: \"Woke up and thought of everyone at school. This made me cry.

      "bodyText": "Tiredness crept in like a warm blanket And suffocated me in sleep My bones ached, my mind was tired My will, my motivation, both weak. Tom Bidwell's eyes are shadowed in grey and he is still skinny. But not as skinny as he used to be. He is up to seven stone. It's progress; a couple of years ago he was half a foot smaller and a stone heavier. Tom, now 16, is recovering from cancer of the lymph glands. He has been through chemotherapy, radiotherapy and a bone-marrow transplant, and he has popped more pills than most people will hope to see in a lifetime. And alongside all the conventional medicines, he has discovered his own form of complementary therapy - writing. It would be an exaggeration to say that Tom has written his way back to good health, but his writing has certainly helped. There are poems of anger, poems of love and loss, poems of tears and fears, poems of entrapment. I don't wanna die, Mum, Don't wanna have to cry, Mum Don't wanna ask why, Mum But why? I just feel so bad, Mum It hurts to see you sad, Mum Not strong enough to get mad, Mum Not strong We'll make it through the grey, Mum Tomorrow's another day, Mum I love you more than I can say, Mum Love you Tom's mum and dad meet me at Preston station. Jack is a big, brawny Lancastrian who you just know must have been a no-nonsense centre back in his day. Barbara is smart and petite, a dead ringer for Sheila Grant. They talk about Tom with pride and tenderness. I get a strange deja vu when I meet Tom. When I was a child, I was also ill and watched the weeks in darkness turn into months, and the months turn into years. Like Tom, I had a serious illness (encephalitis), and like Tom, I turned to poetry. Both of us had a precocious sense of the darkness in life, and both of us ripped off the Beatles mercilessly. When Tom first went to the doctor, aged 14, he was told he had a pulled muscle and that he should exercise more. \"The next day I tried to shave my brother's head with a razor and the vibrations made me pass out.\" He went back to the doctor, who told him he had been standing on the streets for too long and had caught a cold. At which point Barbara called for a second opinion. Tom says it was January 5 1999 when he was diagnosed with cancer. You don't forget dates like that. He shows off the contours of his illness. There are numerous scars, reminders of all those tubes and needles - lumbar punctures, biopsies, thoracotomies. Tom became bitter, resentful. He would ask a question to which there was no answer: what have I done to deserve such pain? Tom became estranged from his friends and lost his faith in God. As well as his poetry he kept a diary. In February 1999 he wrote: \"Woke up and thought of everyone at school. This made me cry. Mum came in and asked, 'Why are you crying?' and I gave five reasons. 1) Can't get comfy. 2) Going back for intense treatment soon. 3) I just want to be back to normal. 4) Why? 5) I smell. Mum said she could only solve number 5, so I had a bath. After my bath I smelled myself, realised I still smelled, and started crying again.\" He says the writing has been liberating, but doesn't quite know how to put it into words.

      "body": "<p>Yesterday morning my husband told me that RS Thomas had died. I was thinking of RS the night before, when we saw a collage of one of his most famous poems, Welsh Landscape, stuck on the wall of a school where we had been for an evening class in navigation. The children had made a Welsh landscape out of tissue paper, with 3D hedges and suitably brooding mountains. Today, I feel lost because one of the peaks by which I orient myself has suddenly disappeared. </p> <p>RS Thomas was a giant in the poetry world and his passing cuts our contact with the generation which included what he referred to as \"the other Thomases\" - Edward and Dylan. </p> <p>Born in 1913, RS Thomas, the son of a ship's captain from Anglesey, became a clergyman in the Church in Wales. He chose rural parishes to allow him time to write in the mornings and because of his love of nature, birds in particular. </p> <p>His early poems such as A Peasant and Evans celebrated the bare, heroic lives of Welsh hill farmers; his portraits of their physical and spiritual poverty were shockingly unromantic, a savage rebellion against the sentimentality of romantic lyricism. Thomas's religious poetry was unrelenting in its search for a fickle and sometimes cruel God. His subject was himself: </p> <p> \"on the margin </p> <p>of eternity, dissolution, </p> <p>nothing but the self </p> <p>looking up at the self </p> <p>looking down ... </p> <p>from bottomless fathoms </p> <p>I dredge up the truth.\" </p> <p>RS Thomas could be a forbidding figure. The first time I met him, to interview him for a Cambridge student magazine, I was so frightened that I asked a friend to come with me. We were astonished to find him a surprisingly humorous interviewee, though he did correct my spelling of something to do with feathers when I sent him a copy of the interview. </p> <p>He didn't suffer fools gladly and was likely to rebuff any approach which he considered disrespectful of Wales or poetry. There is a story about one over-eager arts administrator deciding to take a Welsh Arts Council prize, which RS had won, to the poet in person. The officer made the pilgrimage to the remote manse where RS lived, expecting to be thanked profusely for the cheque. When RS answered the door, the story goes, the man explained his mission and smiled graciously. \"Thank you,\" said RS, and shut the door in his face. </p> <p>RS's total lack of interest in cultivating favour or in ingratiating himself with anybody may have contributed to the serious underestimation of him as a poet in the UK. It was certainly a direct result of his huge moral courage as a poet. He refused to be distracted from the great questions of existence. His stare at the blankness of eternity was unrelenting. </p> <p>Over a career spanning most of a century, he was able to breathe thinner air than most of us but then, he had travelled further up the mountain and commanded a rarer view. His poetry was not written for entertain ment, but to be of use to people as they lived and died. And yet, his austerity was full of unexpected tenderness and sensuality; he was a magnificent love poet. </p> <p> I got to know RS better at the end of his life, after we read together in Barcelona at about the time of the last football World Cup. </p> <p>I had always addressed him as Mr Thomas, but ventured to ask what I should call him, as we had known each other for 20 years. \"Ronaldo,\" he said, deadpan. I never dared call him that, but every visit to him and his second wife Betty was filled with laughter and irreverence. This was a side of him which was seldom seen in public. </p> <p>He was a generous friend, answering requests by return of post. I once saw him drive through a whole day and half the night in order to honour an engagement with a group of local schoolchildren. His favourite shop-bought cake was the chocolate one made by Cadbury. </p> <p>On the face of it it is hard to see what a minor Welsh cleric could have to say to young people at the start of the 21st century. Great poetry, whatever the circumstances in which it is written, has everything to do with everywhere. </p> <p>Looking at that collage stuck up on the wall of the school, RS had already become the glue, sticky on the pupils' fingers, the tongues moving along their lips as they concentrated, as well as the poem the class had copied out. </p> <p>And, reading one of my favourite poems of his again, after struggling with symbols on a shipping chart, I'm comforted that he saw himself as one who had </p> <p> \"been made free </p> <p>by the tide's pendulum truth </p> <p>that the heart that is low </p> <p>now </p> <p>will be at the full tomorrow.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Gwyneth Lewis is a Welsh poet. </p> <p><a href=\"comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Yesterday morning my husband told me that RS Thomas had died. I was thinking of RS the night before, when we saw a collage of one of his most famous poems, Welsh Landscape, stuck on the wall of a school where we had been for an evening class in navigation. The children had made a Welsh landscape out of tissue paper, with 3D hedges and suitably brooding mountains. Today, I feel lost because one of the peaks by which I orient myself has suddenly disappeared. RS Thomas was a giant in the poetry world and his passing cuts our contact with the generation which included what he referred to as \"the other Thomases\" - Edward and Dylan. Born in 1913, RS Thomas, the son of a ship's captain from Anglesey, became a clergyman in the Church in Wales. He chose rural parishes to allow him time to write in the mornings and because of his love of nature, birds in particular. His early poems such as A Peasant and Evans celebrated the bare, heroic lives of Welsh hill farmers; his portraits of their physical and spiritual poverty were shockingly unromantic, a savage rebellion against the sentimentality of romantic lyricism. Thomas's religious poetry was unrelenting in its search for a fickle and sometimes cruel God. His subject was himself: \"on the margin of eternity, dissolution, nothing but the self looking up at the self looking down ... from bottomless fathoms I dredge up the truth.\" RS Thomas could be a forbidding figure. The first time I met him, to interview him for a Cambridge student magazine, I was so frightened that I asked a friend to come with me. We were astonished to find him a surprisingly humorous interviewee, though he did correct my spelling of something to do with feathers when I sent him a copy of the interview. He didn't suffer fools gladly and was likely to rebuff any approach which he considered disrespectful of Wales or poetry. There is a story about one over-eager arts administrator deciding to take a Welsh Arts Council prize, which RS had won, to the poet in person. The officer made the pilgrimage to the remote manse where RS lived, expecting to be thanked profusely for the cheque. When RS answered the door, the story goes, the man explained his mission and smiled graciously. \"Thank you,\" said RS, and shut the door in his face. RS's total lack of interest in cultivating favour or in ingratiating himself with anybody may have contributed to the serious underestimation of him as a poet in the UK. It was certainly a direct result of his huge moral courage as a poet. He refused to be distracted from the great questions of existence. His stare at the blankness of eternity was unrelenting. Over a career spanning most of a century, he was able to breathe thinner air than most of us but then, he had travelled further up the mountain and commanded a rarer view. His poetry was not written for entertain ment, but to be of use to people as they lived and died. And yet, his austerity was full of unexpected tenderness and sensuality; he was a magnificent love poet. I got to know RS better at the end of his life, after we read together in Barcelona at about the time of the last football World Cup. I had always addressed him as Mr Thomas, but ventured to ask what I should call him, as we had known each other for 20 years. \"Ronaldo,\" he said, deadpan. I never dared call him that, but every visit to him and his second wife Betty was filled with laughter and irreverence. This was a side of him which was seldom seen in public. He was a generous friend, answering requests by return of post. I once saw him drive through a whole day and half the night in order to honour an engagement with a group of local schoolchildren. His favourite shop-bought cake was the chocolate one made by Cadbury. On the face of it it is hard to see what a minor Welsh cleric could have to say to young people at the start of the 21st century. Great poetry, whatever the circumstances in which it is written, has everything to do with everywhere. Looking at that collage stuck up on the wall of the school, RS had already become the glue, sticky on the pupils' fingers, the tongues moving along their lips as they concentrated, as well as the poem the class had copied out. And, reading one of my favourite poems of his again, after struggling with symbols on a shipping chart, I'm comforted that he saw himself as one who had \"been made free by the tide's pendulum truth that the heart that is low now will be at the full tomorrow.\" \u0095 Gwyneth Lewis is a Welsh poet. comment@theguardian.com",

A three-hour meeting between union leaders and officials from several constituency Labour parties agreed the wording of the motion to be put to delegates in Brighton.

A Unison official says the union has argued that the state pension should not be eroded and a GMB official says the motion is designed to be constructive, leaving the Government a number of options. GMB general secretary John Edmonds has made it clear that the unions will press the Labour leadership on the issue of the pensions-earnings link. His union wants to see the annual increase in pensions linked to the increase in earnings, he said, adding that the Government had made a big mistake by setting itself against restoration of the link.

      "body": "<p>This conference has seen pensions policy become a ticking parcel no minister wants to be left holding least it explode in their hands. On Monday, Gordon Brown cleverly passed the issue on to the prime minister by promising a complex (yet inexpensive) fudge, to be unveiled in full later this year.</p> <p>Yesterday, Tony Blair told his party he had heard their complaints at the 75p increase in the basic state pension and would do better next time. He then landed the problem in the lap of the secretary of state for social security, Alistair Darling.</p> <p>And this afternoon Mr Darling kicked off a conference debate on the subject with a speech which managed to be both a robust defence of government policy and an apparent climbdown. He was opposed by one of the great figures of Labour history, Barbara Castle, who gave a short but powerful speech which delighted even those who opposed her.</p> <p>So has Mr Darling stopped the pensions bomb ticking? Perhaps - but we will only know for sure when we get the result of a knife-edge vote on an emergency motion on the issue later tonight.</p> <p>Losing the vote would be embarrassing for the prime minister. Such things are not supposed to happen in New Labour. But it would hardly be a crisis and would not force the government to change its position, though it would add weight to calls to do so.</p> <p>Part of the problem for the government is that its case can appear frighteningly complex. This week, ministers have made it more so by announcing all sorts of clever schemes which they say will ease the plight of poor pensioners without passing more government money to those who don't really need it.</p> <p>Why give cash to rich retirees such as Margaret Thatcher, spin doctors have been asking? They claim (like Mr Darling today) that the government's own proposals mean \"more, much more\" than restoring the earnings link.</p> <p>In fact, the dispute is a simple one. At its heart is the question of whether the social security budget should be used as a last resort for the poorest in society, as the government wants, or whether it should be expanded to provide a reasonable retirement income for everyone, which many in Labour would like but which would be expensive.</p> <p>No one thinks much of the current position, which leaves the poor without adequate resources. Even the government has given up defending this year's 75p rise in the basic state pension.</p> <p>Certainly in their hearts, delegates would like to see a restoration of the link between the rise in average earnings and pension payments. Barbara Castle, the former minister who looks like a sweet old granny but can act like the most ruthless politician at times, is doing her best to bring this about by defeating the government in today's vote.</p> <p>Speaking in the debate (to cheers and a standing ovation), she said she could not \"understand\" why the government would not restore the earnings link. It would mean the state pension was \"dead\".</p> <p>\"Comrades, pass this resolution today. This country can afford it,\" she said to loud support. Barbara Castle, who is 90 this week, was applauded by the chancellor and the social security mininster as she left the platform.</p> <p>And she may get her way today. That would keep the issue as a running sore for the government just at a time which it would like the wound to heal. So ministers will be hoping they win.</p> <p>Even if they lose, though, Gordon Brown, the iron chancellor whose reputation has been half-restored this week, is unlikely to change course.</p>",

      "bodyText": "This conference has seen pensions policy become a ticking parcel no minister wants to be left holding least it explode in their hands. On Monday, Gordon Brown cleverly passed the issue on to the prime minister by promising a complex (yet inexpensive) fudge, to be unveiled in full later this year. Yesterday, Tony Blair told his party he had heard their complaints at the 75p increase in the basic state pension and would do better next time. He then landed the problem in the lap of the secretary of state for social security, Alistair Darling. And this afternoon Mr Darling kicked off a conference debate on the subject with a speech which managed to be both a robust defence of government policy and an apparent climbdown. He was opposed by one of the great figures of Labour history, Barbara Castle, who gave a short but powerful speech which delighted even those who opposed her. So has Mr Darling stopped the pensions bomb ticking? Perhaps - but we will only know for sure when we get the result of a knife-edge vote on an emergency motion on the issue later tonight. Losing the vote would be embarrassing for the prime minister. Such things are not supposed to happen in New Labour. But it would hardly be a crisis and would not force the government to change its position, though it would add weight to calls to do so. Part of the problem for the government is that its case can appear frighteningly complex. This week, ministers have made it more so by announcing all sorts of clever schemes which they say will ease the plight of poor pensioners without passing more government money to those who don't really need it. Why give cash to rich retirees such as Margaret Thatcher, spin doctors have been asking? They claim (like Mr Darling today) that the government's own proposals mean \"more, much more\" than restoring the earnings link. In fact, the dispute is a simple one. At its heart is the question of whether the social security budget should be used as a last resort for the poorest in society, as the government wants, or whether it should be expanded to provide a reasonable retirement income for everyone, which many in Labour would like but which would be expensive. No one thinks much of the current position, which leaves the poor without adequate resources. Even the government has given up defending this year's 75p rise in the basic state pension. Certainly in their hearts, delegates would like to see a restoration of the link between the rise in average earnings and pension payments. Barbara Castle, the former minister who looks like a sweet old granny but can act like the most ruthless politician at times, is doing her best to bring this about by defeating the government in today's vote. Speaking in the debate (to cheers and a standing ovation), she said she could not \"understand\" why the government would not restore the earnings link. It would mean the state pension was \"dead\". \"Comrades, pass this resolution today. This country can afford it,\" she said to loud support. Barbara Castle, who is 90 this week, was applauded by the chancellor and the social security mininster as she left the platform. And she may get her way today. That would keep the issue as a running sore for the government just at a time which it would like the wound to heal. So ministers will be hoping they win. Even if they lose, though, Gordon Brown, the iron chancellor whose reputation has been half-restored this week, is unlikely to change course.",

You could argue, he says, that marketing is no longer any use because everyone is doing it. In a paper presented to the US Account Planning Group's annual conference in Miami, Earls said the marketing industry is the reason why many businesses are so unconducive to invention and innovative thinking, because its principles were developed for an earlier business age. He says one of the main problems is the industry's reliance on consumer research. \"In a world changing as fast as ours, the consumer is a very poor guide to tomorrow.

There will be declining demand in the second quarter of 2001 and with stocks rising there won't be strong demand for Opec crude.\"</p> <p>Opec - which controls two-thirds of world crude exports - has achieved a new relevance amid the greatest oil boom since the 1980s and protests throughout Europe at pump prices.</p> <p>Although Ali Rodriguez, Venezuela's oil minister and Opec president, believes that prices will stabilise at a \"fair\" $25 a barrel, the cartel does not agree with the Group of Seven leading industrialised countries, which favour increased production as a solution to consumer pressure, instead of a cut in petrol taxes.</p> <p>Opec's new-found confidence is a dramatic turnaround from two years ago, when oil prices sank to $10 a barrel and the cartel was mired in bickering over quota busting. Now - thanks in part to Venezuela's ebullient leader, Hugo Chavez - Opec is returning to the influence it wielded in the 1970s and 80s.</p> <p>Mr Chavez has worked tirelessly to remodel the cartel into a consumer-friendly advocacy group. In August he toured all the Opec countries.</p> <p>On Monday night, Mr Chavez gave a televised address to the country, full of his typical revolutionary rhetoric, saying that the industrialised world had grown rich on the cheap oil from producing countries.</p> <p>\"This reunion isn't only about oil,\" he said, referring to the two-day summit which begins today. Opec would also focus on global poverty, foreign debts and unfair terms of trade for developing countries in their search \"for a more just world\", he said.</p> <p>Industrialised countries which were flush with cheap oil a few years ago are now demanding that Opec acts to stabilise a gyrating market that has seen oil prices reach 10-year highs and prompted protests in Europe.</p> <p>Opec's secretary general, Ril wanu Lukman of Nigeria, said cartel members were surprised by the industrialised countries' refusal in Prague to cut oil taxes. Opec views such taxes - along with free market speculators and hindrances in refining - as the real cause of high prices.</p> <p>Since his election in 1998, Mr Chavez has seized the stage at opportune moments to cajole fellow leaders of developing countries to unite and confront the perils of globalisation. When oil prices fell in 1998, Venezuela plunged into a devastating recession it is still struggling to escape from. Unemployment is officially 15%, while some 80% of its 23m people live in poverty.</p> <p>Mr Chavez said on Monday that his government was following in the footsteps of the late Juan Pablo Perez Alfonzo, a Venezuelan energy minister who was a founding father of Opec in 1960 and helped break the stranglehold of foreign oil companies on oil-producing countries.</p> <p>\"And now, Opec has arisen again,\" Mr Chavez said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Libya's oil minister yesterday warned that Opec would be forced to cut its oil output if the price of petroleum dropped as a result of a US move to release emergency supplies. As ministers arrived in Caracas for the first Opec summit in 25 years, the Libyan oil minister, Abdullah el-Badri, said: \"I hope this decision [by the US] doesn't shrink the price too much and we are forced to cut production.\" Algeria's energy and mining minister, Chakib Khelil, also warned: \"There is a good chance we will have to [cut output]. There will be declining demand in the second quarter of 2001 and with stocks rising there won't be strong demand for Opec crude.\" Opec - which controls two-thirds of world crude exports - has achieved a new relevance amid the greatest oil boom since the 1980s and protests throughout Europe at pump prices. Although Ali Rodriguez, Venezuela's oil minister and Opec president, believes that prices will stabilise at a \"fair\" $25 a barrel, the cartel does not agree with the Group of Seven leading industrialised countries, which favour increased production as a solution to consumer pressure, instead of a cut in petrol taxes. Opec's new-found confidence is a dramatic turnaround from two years ago, when oil prices sank to $10 a barrel and the cartel was mired in bickering over quota busting. Now - thanks in part to Venezuela's ebullient leader, Hugo Chavez - Opec is returning to the influence it wielded in the 1970s and 80s. Mr Chavez has worked tirelessly to remodel the cartel into a consumer-friendly advocacy group. In August he toured all the Opec countries. On Monday night, Mr Chavez gave a televised address to the country, full of his typical revolutionary rhetoric, saying that the industrialised world had grown rich on the cheap oil from producing countries. \"This reunion isn't only about oil,\" he said, referring to the two-day summit which begins today. Opec would also focus on global poverty, foreign debts and unfair terms of trade for developing countries in their search \"for a more just world\", he said. Industrialised countries which were flush with cheap oil a few years ago are now demanding that Opec acts to stabilise a gyrating market that has seen oil prices reach 10-year highs and prompted protests in Europe. Opec's secretary general, Ril wanu Lukman of Nigeria, said cartel members were surprised by the industrialised countries' refusal in Prague to cut oil taxes. Opec views such taxes - along with free market speculators and hindrances in refining - as the real cause of high prices. Since his election in 1998, Mr Chavez has seized the stage at opportune moments to cajole fellow leaders of developing countries to unite and confront the perils of globalisation. When oil prices fell in 1998, Venezuela plunged into a devastating recession it is still struggling to escape from. Unemployment is officially 15%, while some 80% of its 23m people live in poverty. Mr Chavez said on Monday that his government was following in the footsteps of the late Juan Pablo Perez Alfonzo, a Venezuelan energy minister who was a founding father of Opec in 1960 and helped break the stranglehold of foreign oil companies on oil-producing countries. \"And now, Opec has arisen again,\" Mr Chavez said.",

Mr Roberts added: \"If we were a dot.com company nobody would bat an eyelid at us if we invested millions in a new venture and made a loss.\" </p> <p>He admitted he was concerned at the fall. \"It's very important to us to have the share price reflecting the true value of the business.

ICM's chief executive, Barry Roberts, said he was stunned by the fall: \"They're interpreting it as a warning for the whole year. That is not the case. We're reasonably optimistic about the outcome, without being over-zealous.\" He said ICM anticipated sluggish first-half profits because it was investing heavily in new disaster recovery centres. He expected the shortfall to be made up later in the year. Mr Roberts added: \"If we were a dot.com company nobody would bat an eyelid at us if we invested millions in a new venture and made a loss.\" He admitted he was concerned at the fall. \"It's very important to us to have the share price reflecting the true value of the business. If it doesn't, acquisitions which involve an exchange of shares can be much more expensive than they ought to be.\" The confusion affected companies across the sector - Computacenter, Sage and Guardian IT saw their shares slip sharply. Traders have been jumpy about computer services companies since a number of groups, including ICM, warned in the spring that demand from clients was patchy. ICM's year-end profits edged up 4.1% to \u00a34.51m before tax, with a solid performance from its IT support and solutions arms. The company invested \u00a35.8m last year in three disaster recovery centres. It announced yesterday that it was constructing a new centre in East Anglia. Analyst Max Worton of Williams de Broe said the market had over-reacted: \"They put in a cautiously worded statement and it scared people.\" Pressure on profits Profits warnings from computer services companies this year: \u0095 Parity Disclosed in May that the demand for IT had not picked up in the new millennium \u0095 Computacenter Said in June it had suffered from slow take-up of Microsoft Windows 2000 and the lag in IT spending \u0095 Synstar Warned in June of a slowdown in the market for short-term project contracts, particularly in data management and networking, and a setback at its Italian subsidiary \u0095 Lynx Admitted in July that earnings would fall short due to poor demand for software from the auto sales and financial services sectors",

      "body": "<p>Tony Blair's task yesterday was clear, even if it was daunting. He had to reassert his authority after two disastrous weeks, including a fuel crisis in which he seemed to lose his grip completely. At the same time he needed to rebut the charge that he is arrogant and out of touch. In other words, he had to show that he is both in charge and at the service of the people - no mean feat. Beyond that he also had to address the grievance at the root of the fuel revolt, by defending the very principle of taxation and spending. And, with Labour suddenly behind in the polls, he had to cheer up his own troops and reconnect with the voters who appear to be deserting him.</p> <p>If that was the task, how did Mr Blair measure up? The immediate answer is pretty well. The prime minister gave an address that was shrewdly judged and adroitly delivered, ticking the political boxes one by one. It may not have satisfied those who sought a persuasive intellectual vision of the next phase of the New Labour project; the speech was more of a robust argument for traditional social democracy. Still, big ideas were probably a luxury on a day like yesterday. Mr Blair had more urgent work to do - and he did it.</p> <p>He began, rightly, by addressing the most urgent concerns. In a bid to defeat the arrogance charge, he effectively said sorry for the Dome, before addressing the demand for higher state pensions. In a brilliantly brief sentence, he said simply \"75p... we get the message.\" He struck the opposite note on fuel by refusing to bow to the protesters' demands, preferring to make a show of firm leadership, unbuffeted by the gusts of day-to-day opinion. In so doing, Tony Blair made an impressive case for representative government, explaining that we elect leaders not simply to be conduits for our daily whims but to take decisions in the long-term, collective interest. He won loud applause when he cast his government as the voice \"for those who can't protest, whose voice isn't supported by the media\". It was a good partisan shot at the rightwing, but it was also a cogent rejection of the current clamour for populist, direct democracy.</p> <p>The bulk of the speech was an equally basic argument for government - with a full-throated defence of the activist state. Echoing Gordon Brown's barnstormer on Monday, Mr Blair happily presented Labour as the party of public services, with the Tories as the slashers and cutters. As one Blairite aide puts it, there is now \"clear red water\" between the two main parties. To that end, Mr Blair praised teachers, doctors and the police - implicitly telling the voters that they are getting good value for all their tax money.

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair's task yesterday was clear, even if it was daunting. He had to reassert his authority after two disastrous weeks, including a fuel crisis in which he seemed to lose his grip completely. At the same time he needed to rebut the charge that he is arrogant and out of touch. In other words, he had to show that he is both in charge and at the service of the people - no mean feat. Beyond that he also had to address the grievance at the root of the fuel revolt, by defending the very principle of taxation and spending. And, with Labour suddenly behind in the polls, he had to cheer up his own troops and reconnect with the voters who appear to be deserting him. If that was the task, how did Mr Blair measure up? The immediate answer is pretty well. The prime minister gave an address that was shrewdly judged and adroitly delivered, ticking the political boxes one by one. It may not have satisfied those who sought a persuasive intellectual vision of the next phase of the New Labour project; the speech was more of a robust argument for traditional social democracy. Still, big ideas were probably a luxury on a day like yesterday. Mr Blair had more urgent work to do - and he did it. He began, rightly, by addressing the most urgent concerns. In a bid to defeat the arrogance charge, he effectively said sorry for the Dome, before addressing the demand for higher state pensions. In a brilliantly brief sentence, he said simply \"75p... we get the message.\" He struck the opposite note on fuel by refusing to bow to the protesters' demands, preferring to make a show of firm leadership, unbuffeted by the gusts of day-to-day opinion. In so doing, Tony Blair made an impressive case for representative government, explaining that we elect leaders not simply to be conduits for our daily whims but to take decisions in the long-term, collective interest. He won loud applause when he cast his government as the voice \"for those who can't protest, whose voice isn't supported by the media\". It was a good partisan shot at the rightwing, but it was also a cogent rejection of the current clamour for populist, direct democracy. The bulk of the speech was an equally basic argument for government - with a full-throated defence of the activist state. Echoing Gordon Brown's barnstormer on Monday, Mr Blair happily presented Labour as the party of public services, with the Tories as the slashers and cutters. As one Blairite aide puts it, there is now \"clear red water\" between the two main parties. To that end, Mr Blair praised teachers, doctors and the police - implicitly telling the voters that they are getting good value for all their tax money. The fact that he praised those public services without attaching his usual demand for reform made this perhaps the most old Labour speech Tony Blair has ever delivered. Not that he forgot the new Labour voters who brought him to power. They were thrown some juicy red meat on crime - including an unrepentant revival of his ill-fated call for fixed penalty notices for \"loutish behaviour,\" albeit stripped of its suggestion that offenders be frog-marched to cashpoint machines. For all that calculated positioning, the highlight was the PM's unscripted cadenza about his \"irreducible core\" of principle. The vigilant will have cringed at his promise never to score populist points at the expense of asylum seekers: his government already did that with its war on \"bogus\" refugees. The sceptical will also have noticed Mr Blair's prior disclaimer that he remained a \"unifier\" happy to compromise with big business and even the Tory party. Even so, the party was heartened to hear that their leader has some non-negotiable values. As for the wider electorate, the clear calculation was that Mr Blair needed to reintroduce himself to those voters who feel he has grown distant in recent months. That's why it was so effective for Mr Blair to speak apparently off-the-cuff: he was seeking to reconnect as a human being. The old charge against him was that he was \"phoney Tony\", that he did not believe in anything, preferring to parrot whatever message he heard from the latest focus group. By asserting that he did have some lines he would never cross, Mr Blair hoped for a Thatcher effect: earning the respect of voters for his conviction, even among those who do not agree with him. That may be optimistic, but yesterday provided proof once again that politicians often do best when they put aside the script and simply speak. The current demand for leaders to listen and stay in touch may well be met, at least in part, by this simplest gesture: a politician talking like a person.

He landed a few punches on the Tories, without reopening last year's war against the \"forces of conservatism\": now that that battle is real, he had no need to confect it in a speech. The leader also left his own party in good heart and moved to remind Britons why they liked him in the first place. He caught the right tone of humility and proffered some sound arguments.

Out in the streets there was the clatter of teargas rounds being fired, the whoosh of water cannons and the injured being carted off in ambulances. In the conference centre, where one of eastern Europe's nastiest communist parties used to meet in conclave, Horst Kohler of the International Monetary Fund and James Wolfensohn of the World Bank were applauded politely as they talked of the challenges ahead for globalisation. </p> <p>Kohler quoted Karl Popper as he talked of how his vision was for the IMF to make the world \"a little better\". Wolfensohn said he \"shared the passion\" of the protesters, and in a series of bullet points expressed views that the protesters themselves make - that there is something wrong about a world where the richest 20% of the world's population receive more than 80% of global incomes, where 1.2bn people live on less than a dollar a day and where the average income in the wealthiest countries is 37 times that in the poorest 20. </p> <p>Wolfensohn and Kohler cannot understand why they remain figures of hate when they have changed their message and now talk the language of fairness and inclusion. </p> <p>They hold seminars with debt campaigners, they fund bio-diversity programmes, they accept that there can be dangers from liberalising capital flows too rapidly. And yet they - and the institutions they head - are still loathed by the protesters, who see the fund and the bank as part of the problem rather than part of the solution. The problem being, of course, globalisation. </p> <p>As far as the protesters advocating direct and violent action are concerned, it is clear that crunch time is fast approaching. They need to think hard about what to do next, because demonstration fatigue is already setting in. </p> <p>The street riots in Seattle were effective not only because they had a novelty value but because they appeared to cause the collapse of attempts to launch a new round of trade talks. In fact, while there was a lot of sound and fury on the streets, the real problem was inside the conference centre, where the poor countries refused to be rolled over by the United States. Had the European Union and the United States been able to persuade a few of the bigger developing countries to come on board, there would have been a deal in Seattle, protests or not. </p> <p>Neither the protests at the spring meetings of the bank and fund in April, nor those intended to disrupt the annual meetings in Prague, have had the same impact. </p> <p>The demonstrators have not been able to stop the meetings from taking place, let alone achieve their wider objective of rolling back globalisation. Far from it. According to the fund's forecasts, global capitalism is enjoying its best year of growth for more than a decade. All the laptops and mobile phones that have been bought by the demonstrators to coordinate their protests are doing wonders for the profits of Microsoft, Intel and Nokia. </p> <p>Yet from one perspective, the current state of the global economy is a total irrelevance. Globalisation, it is said, will be brought down by its own internal contradictions, just as Marx predicted more than a century ago, and direct action will be the handmaiden of the revolution. </p> <p> This is a perfectly acceptable view of the world, and it may even be right. It has to be said, however, that industrial capitalism has proved to be a far more durable opponent than its enemies have expected. It also needs to be acknowledged that direct action is something of a double-edged sword, which can be used by the forces of reaction - as in the recent fuel protests in Britain - as well as by the forces of progress. </p> <p>History suggests that protest groups only turn into successful mass movements when they tap into widespread discontent and offer a feasible alternative. So far, there is no real evidence that the anti-globalisation protesters have achieved either. \"I know what they are against,\" said Trevor Manuel, the finance minister of South Africa, yesterday. \"But I don't know what they are for.\" </p> <p>This, then, is the dilemma for the anti-globalisation protests. Their action has been a limited success to the extent that it has forced many of the problems of globalisation - the inequity, the instability of the financial system, the threat to the environment, the importance of human rights - higher up the political agenda at a time when the failures of neo- liberalism and the financial crises of the late 90s were already contributing to a mood in which those at the apex of globalisation are willing to talk and debate the need for reform. But Seattle, Washington and now Prague have certainly concentrated minds and created space for the moderate wing of anti-globalisation to push for more generous debt relief and universal primary education. </p> <p>But dialogue and debate do not provide the same buzz, the same instant gratification, as chucking a Molotov cocktail or throwing a smokebomb. If you're an idealistic student, the idea of cutting a deal with Jim Wolfensohn is far less attractive than calling him a fascist or a mass murderer. Jim Morrison of the Doors used to send his audience wild with ecstasy in the 60s when he bellowed \"We want the world and we want it now\", and, in truth, little has changed since. The grotesque imbalances - in both power and wealth - that have become ever more apparent as globalisation has developed makes the desire for instant results understandable. Foot-dragging on debt relief is costing lives in Africa every day. </p> <p>The alternative to violent action is a hard slog, to persuade rich countries to speed up debt relief, to give smaller countries a bigger say in the running of the fund and the bank, to campaign for a world environment organisation with the same clout as that wielded by the world trade organisation, and to make the case for new controls on global capital. </p> <p>But this will be messy, because the democratic route is always messy. Those who advocate it can be accused of lacking ideological purity or of lacking the stomach for a fight. What's more, their way may not work either. </p> <p>Yet the experience of the 60s protests is instructive. As today, they emerged from a period in which the global economy - and the American economy in particular - was doing well. The desire to protest diminished when times got tough, and instead of 20 years of togetherness following a revolutionary golden dawn, we got 20 years of Thatcherism instead. </p> <p>In the meantime, once the leaders of the 60s generation realised that capitalism was not about to collapse, they found a job, settled down and moved to the suburbs. </p> <p> <a href=\"mailto:larry.elliott@theguardian.com\">larry.elliott@theguardian.com</a></p>",

It also needs to be acknowledged that direct action is something of a double-edged sword, which can be used by the forces of reaction - as in the recent fuel protests in Britain - as well as by the forces of progress. History suggests that protest groups only turn into successful mass movements when they tap into widespread discontent and offer a feasible alternative. So far, there is no real evidence that the anti-globalisation protesters have achieved either. \"I know what they are against,\" said Trevor Manuel, the finance minister of South Africa, yesterday. \"But I don't know what they are for.\" This, then, is the dilemma for the anti-globalisation protests. Their action has been a limited success to the extent that it has forced many of the problems of globalisation - the inequity, the instability of the financial system, the threat to the environment, the importance of human rights - higher up the political agenda at a time when the failures of neo- liberalism and the financial crises of the late 90s were already contributing to a mood in which those at the apex of globalisation are willing to talk and debate the need for reform. But Seattle, Washington and now Prague have certainly concentrated minds and created space for the moderate wing of anti-globalisation to push for more generous debt relief and universal primary education. But dialogue and debate do not provide the same buzz, the same instant gratification, as chucking a Molotov cocktail or throwing a smokebomb. If you're an idealistic student, the idea of cutting a deal with Jim Wolfensohn is far less attractive than calling him a fascist or a mass murderer. Jim Morrison of the Doors used to send his audience wild with ecstasy in the 60s when he bellowed \"We want the world and we want it now\", and, in truth, little has changed since. The grotesque imbalances - in both power and wealth - that have become ever more apparent as globalisation has developed makes the desire for instant results understandable. Foot-dragging on debt relief is costing lives in Africa every day. The alternative to violent action is a hard slog, to persuade rich countries to speed up debt relief, to give smaller countries a bigger say in the running of the fund and the bank, to campaign for a world environment organisation with the same clout as that wielded by the world trade organisation, and to make the case for new controls on global capital. But this will be messy, because the democratic route is always messy. Those who advocate it can be accused of lacking ideological purity or of lacking the stomach for a fight. What's more, their way may not work either. Yet the experience of the 60s protests is instructive. As today, they emerged from a period in which the global economy - and the American economy in particular - was doing well. The desire to protest diminished when times got tough, and instead of 20 years of togetherness following a revolutionary golden dawn, we got 20 years of Thatcherism instead. In the meantime, once the leaders of the 60s generation realised that capitalism was not about to collapse, they found a job, settled down and moved to the suburbs. larry.elliott@theguardian.com",

      "body": "<p>It has long been one of football's unsolved mysteries that Spain have never won the World Cup, or even come close. The Olympic tournament bears no comparison, but Spain won the gold in 1992 on home territory, and reached this Saturday's final against Cameroon with a 3-1 victory over the United States.</p> <p> The Spaniards' rich and varied skills overwhelmed a somewhat pedestrian American team whose chief attribute throughout this tournament has been a fierce and Olympian team spirit. </p> <p>The US men had been determined to match their women, the world and Olympic champions, and make the final. But on an evening when the rain lashed down over Sydney it was quickly apparent that mere spirit would not be sufficient. </p> <p>It was, in essence, a very British evening. It might have been West Ham United against Cardiff City in the Worthington Cup at Upton Park, except that Cardiff would have won. Clive Charles, the US coach, who played for both West Ham and Cardiff, must have feared the worst when he looked up into the floodlights of the Sydney Football Ground, a next-door neighbour of the altogether more famous Sydney Cricket Ground, and saw the rain falling. </p> <p>The grassy pitch was slick and fast, and the superior skills of the Spanish were obvious. Just when it seemed their sharp and intelligent approach work might founder once the penalty area was reached, the highly impressive Jose Mari Romero broke swiftly down the right and from his low cross Raul Tamudo slid in to score with the outside of his right foot. </p> <p>A second goal shortly afterwards by Miguel Angulo, again created by Romero, appeared to have put the semi-final beyond the reach of the US team until an unnecessary foul by Angulo on Frankie Hejduk just before half-time allowed Pete Vagenas to narrow the deficit with a penalty. </p> <p>A late second-half third goal by Romero underlined Spain's overall superiority, although victory came at a cost. Their captain Toni Velamazan was booked and will miss the final against Cameroon, the African Nations champions, who in a flurry of late goals came from behind to defeat Chile 2-1 in the other semi-final, the winner being scored by Arsenal's Lauren in the 89th minute. </p> <p>Charles believes that his team's performance in Australia will have gone a long way to convincing the world that the US \"are no longer a third-world nation\". The success of the US team in Australia will certainly be seen as another stepping stone towards international maturity, even though the Olympic football tournament is essentially an under-23 competition. </p> <p>Generally the best players are missing, although in terms of pure competition football has a greater validity than the men's Olympic tennis tournament, where the apathy of the professionals is all too obvious. </p> <p>However, it was a pity that the US team, having played their previous matches in Adelaide, Canberra, and Melbourne, pulled out of the Olympic village after only one night and booked themselves into a hotel. \"The village was a lot different to what we had become used to to,\" said Charles. The two-tier Olympics. </p> <p>Sepp Blatter, the Fifa president, still smarting from the Charlie Dempsey debacle, has assured Oceania that he bears them no ill will, and has attempted to encourage Australia to bid for the World Cup. \"After organising such a fantastic Olympics, I feel sure they could stage the World Cup,\" said Blatter, who has apparently not given up the idea of holding football's premier tournament every two years. No doubt Mr Samaranch may have a word in Blatter's shell-like before Sunday's closing ceremony. </p> <p>Tomorrow the US plays Norway for the gold medal in the women's tournament. The Americans were not unduly impressive during their 1-0 semi-final victory over Brazil, but achieved the objective of having the opportunity to defend the title they won against China in Atlanta. </p> <p>Norway, third in the 1996 games, needed a late own-goal to defeat Germany, and they have already lost to the US in the earlier stages of the tournament here </p> <p>\"Norway are a very good side. They have some absolute world-class players and they won't give an inch,\" said April Heinrichs, the US coach. \"Our games against them have always been tight and I expect no different in the final.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "It has long been one of football's unsolved mysteries that Spain have never won the World Cup, or even come close. The Olympic tournament bears no comparison, but Spain won the gold in 1992 on home territory, and reached this Saturday's final against Cameroon with a 3-1 victory over the United States. The Spaniards' rich and varied skills overwhelmed a somewhat pedestrian American team whose chief attribute throughout this tournament has been a fierce and Olympian team spirit. The US men had been determined to match their women, the world and Olympic champions, and make the final. But on an evening when the rain lashed down over Sydney it was quickly apparent that mere spirit would not be sufficient. It was, in essence, a very British evening. It might have been West Ham United against Cardiff City in the Worthington Cup at Upton Park, except that Cardiff would have won. Clive Charles, the US coach, who played for both West Ham and Cardiff, must have feared the worst when he looked up into the floodlights of the Sydney Football Ground, a next-door neighbour of the altogether more famous Sydney Cricket Ground, and saw the rain falling. The grassy pitch was slick and fast, and the superior skills of the Spanish were obvious. Just when it seemed their sharp and intelligent approach work might founder once the penalty area was reached, the highly impressive Jose Mari Romero broke swiftly down the right and from his low cross Raul Tamudo slid in to score with the outside of his right foot. A second goal shortly afterwards by Miguel Angulo, again created by Romero, appeared to have put the semi-final beyond the reach of the US team until an unnecessary foul by Angulo on Frankie Hejduk just before half-time allowed Pete Vagenas to narrow the deficit with a penalty. A late second-half third goal by Romero underlined Spain's overall superiority, although victory came at a cost. Their captain Toni Velamazan was booked and will miss the final against Cameroon, the African Nations champions, who in a flurry of late goals came from behind to defeat Chile 2-1 in the other semi-final, the winner being scored by Arsenal's Lauren in the 89th minute. Charles believes that his team's performance in Australia will have gone a long way to convincing the world that the US \"are no longer a third-world nation\". The success of the US team in Australia will certainly be seen as another stepping stone towards international maturity, even though the Olympic football tournament is essentially an under-23 competition. Generally the best players are missing, although in terms of pure competition football has a greater validity than the men's Olympic tennis tournament, where the apathy of the professionals is all too obvious. However, it was a pity that the US team, having played their previous matches in Adelaide, Canberra, and Melbourne, pulled out of the Olympic village after only one night and booked themselves into a hotel. \"The village was a lot different to what we had become used to to,\" said Charles. The two-tier Olympics. Sepp Blatter, the Fifa president, still smarting from the Charlie Dempsey debacle, has assured Oceania that he bears them no ill will, and has attempted to encourage Australia to bid for the World Cup. \"After organising such a fantastic Olympics, I feel sure they could stage the World Cup,\" said Blatter, who has apparently not given up the idea of holding football's premier tournament every two years. No doubt Mr Samaranch may have a word in Blatter's shell-like before Sunday's closing ceremony. Tomorrow the US plays Norway for the gold medal in the women's tournament. The Americans were not unduly impressive during their 1-0 semi-final victory over Brazil, but achieved the objective of having the opportunity to defend the title they won against China in Atlanta. Norway, third in the 1996 games, needed a late own-goal to defeat Germany, and they have already lost to the US in the earlier stages of the tournament here \"Norway are a very good side. They have some absolute world-class players and they won't give an inch,\" said April Heinrichs, the US coach. \"Our games against them have always been tight and I expect no different in the final.\"",

In a series of violent clashes, the police, backed up by army detachments, squared up to activists who were laying siege to Prague's heavily guarded congress centre yesterday. Five hours of angry confrontations resulted in injuries to at least 60 people and left delegates trapped inside the building by the security cordon set up to prevent a repeat of the chaos that marked the World Trade Organisation talks in Seattle last December. However, they failed to prevent the gathering of the world's financial elite.

      "body": "<b> Health</b> <br> <p> Tony Blair promised yesterday to slash waiting times for cancer patients as part of a six-year strategy to increase survival rates from among the worst to the best in Europe. </p> <p>A national cancer plan to be published today will pledge \"a step change in the quality of NHS cancer care\". </p> <p>Posts for more than 1,000 extra consultants in the cancer specialisms will be created by 2006 increasing the capacity of NHS cancer facilities by nearly a third. This will allow a progressive reduction in waiting times. </p> <p>Alan Milburn, the health secretary, said: \"By the end of this year all patients with suspected cancer, urgently referred by their GP, will be seen by a specialist within two weeks. As the number of cancer specialists rise, we can make progress towards a maximum wait of one month from diagnosis to treatment, with most people treated much more quickly.\" </p> <p>Other parts of the programme will include an extra \u00a323m for cancer research and a promise by the prime minister that \"by 2003 for the first time the government will be matching pound for pound charity funding for cancer research\". </p> <p>The plan, drawn up by ministers and Mike Richards, the cancer tsar, will renew and upgrade cancer scanning and screening equipment that is used by about 400,000 patients a year. </p> <p>Mr Milburn promised to spend \u00a3300m by 2004 on NHS cancer equipment including 50 new MRI scanners, 45 linear accelerators and 200 CT scanners. </p> <p>The NHS plan, published in July, established cancer and coronary heart disease as top priorities for investment. </p> <p>Cancer kills 100,000 in Britain each year and the government said it was unacceptable that unskilled workers were twice as likely to die from cancer as professionals. Survival rates were worse in Britain for several common cancers than in equivalent European countries. </p> <p>Mr Blair warned yesterday: \"As things stand one in every four people in this country will die of cancer.\" The plan will today explain how the government intends to address the problem with \"substantial improvements to every aspect of cancer services - prevention, research, screening, diagnosis, treatment and palliative care.\" </p> <p>Over the next six years numbers of cancer specialists will increase from 3,362 to 4,333. Over the same period posts will be created for 257 extra general surgeons, 123 urologists and 208 gastro-enterologists - the three specialties crucial to cutting waiting times for cancer treatment. </p> <p>The Department of Health said: \"In addition, the plan will also set out proposals for boosting the number of other staff who have vital special skills, such as radiographers, medical physicists and staff trained in endoscopy. There will also be proposals for improving the skills and flexibility of the NHS workforce involved in delivering cancer services.\" </p> <p>Mr Blair also promised an end to the postcode lottery for cancer treatment.\"Cancer patients in all parts of the country will get the right drugs at the right time, regardless of where they live,\" he said. </p> <p>The national institute for clinical excellence will make an assessment of recently licensed cancer drugs to ensure they are available for all patients if they are shown to be cost effective. </p> <p>There will be an extension of screening for breast cancer which kills 11,000 women each year. \"Because it causes so much pain and suffering among Britain's families we will extend breast cancer screening to all women over 65, helping an extra 400,000 women by 2004,\" the prime minister said. </p> <p>The Cancer Research Campaign said it was a red letter day for patients, volunteers and charities. \"We did not expect the prime minister's pledge to match charity funding pound for pound. That will mean about \u00a3200m extra each year to plough into research and treatments. It will give our volunteers an enormous boost to raise even more cash for cures,\" said Gordon McVie, the campaign's director general. John Carvel </p> <p><b> Education</b><br> </p> <p> Tony Blair last night reasserted education as the government's number one priority for the next parliament and made a spending pledge potentially worth billions to Britain's schools. </p> <p>He said the next Labour manifesto would repeat its 1997 pledge - \"line one of our contract with the people\" - to increase the share of national income spent on education. </p> <p>\"Education, education, education - then, now and in the future,\" the prime minister said. </p> <p>Policy, \"the next stage of our journey\", would be directed at creating \"first class secondary schools\" to match the already \"excellent primary schools\", creating 1,000 specialist schools by 2004 - double the number now and 200 more than previously pledged. </p> <p>Extra money will be attached to catch-up lessons for 11- and 12-year-olds who fell below expected literacy and numeracy standards and new targets for results at key stage three, at age 14, and at 16. By 2004, 54% of pupils will be expected to achieve five A*-C grades at GCSE. </p> <p>Mr Blair unveiled plans for an extra \u00a31bn spending on ICT - actually \u00a3710m in new money allocated from the July comprehensive spending review - to deliver one computer for every five children in secondary and one computer for every eight in primary schools. </p> <p>The education secretary, David Blunkett, will today unveil a three-year, \u00a38bn package to repair Britain's crumbling schools. All schools will get some money for repairs, funnelled directly to schools: 600 will be either rebuilt or completely transformed. </p> <p>Mr Blunkett will also promise to deliver more direct funding to schools, cutting local authorities out of the loop, which will annoy them but please head teachers. </p> <p>The government will just achieve its target on spending as a share of national income - on this measure, only this year will spending beat John Major's last year, and then only by 0.1% to 4.8%. But spending will start to rise from next year and is, on government estimates, set to increase education's share of national income to 5.3% by 2004. </p> <p>But, assuming that the economy continues to growth, Mr Blair's promise will mean hefty extra sums beyond then. And it gives the education secretary considerable leverage with the chancellor. </p> <p>Mr Blunkett came out reasonably well in the spending review, but argued hard in private with Gordon Brown and was upset not to have won more. </p> <p>He last night summoned the spirit of Britain's Olympic success to promote the specialist schools which specialise in sports, arts, languages or technology. Mr Blair massaged the teachers - like our doctors and armed forces, they were the best in the world. \"Education is the passion of this government,\" he said. </p> <p>John Dunford, general secretary of the Secondary Heads Association, welcomed Mr Blair's pledges, though he was anxious about the new targets. Extra money for ICT was essential because in five years' time existing school computers would be obsolete. Mr Blunkett is concerned to bridge the \"digital divide\". </p> <p>But Mr Dunford noted the extra specialist schools, which the government believes is creating excellence and diversity, but which others in Labour ranks, including Lord Hattersley at a fringe meeting yesterday, regard as an extension of the two-tier state education system. Will Woodward </p> <p><b> Crime</b><br> </p> <p> The police are to be given the power to issue \u00a3100 fixed penalty fines to anyone found drunk in public or indulging in loutish disorderly behaviour as the main plank of Tony Blair's promise yesterday that it was time for \"zero tolerance of yob culture\". </p> <p>The new scheme has dropped all plans to \"march drunken youths to the nearest cashpoint\", as Mr Blair once suggested, and instead police will issue \u00a3100 tickets in the same way that parking fines are handed with the possibility of contesting the case before a magistrates' court. </p> <p> A Home Office consultation document published after Mr Blair's speech indicates that ministers are proposing that 16- and 17-year-olds as well as adults should be liable for the new \u00a3100 fines and those who repeat the offence within six months will face even heavier penalties. Ministers also believe there is \"a strong case for an automatic increase in the level of the penalty if the fine is not paid within a certain number of days.\" </p> <p>Under the new power the police will be able to fine people for a wide range of disorderly behaviour offences, including drunkenness in public, abusive or insulting behaviour, buying alcohol by or on behalf of under 18s, drinking in public places and minor cases of criminal damage, including spray-painting graffiti. </p> <p>Police will also be given power to arrest anyone who refuses to provide evidence of their name or address. </p> <p>Mr Blair said the new fines were needed because he was determined to deal firmly with the type of loutish behaviour, often fuelled by alcohol, which, he said, had become commonplace in villages, towns and cities. </p> <p>\"Fixed penalty notices will enable the police to deal effectively and speedily with minor offences of public drunkeness and disorder, while reducing the the time they have to spend on paperwork,\" said the prime minister. </p> <p>Mr Blair's tough words will echo in the corridors of his own home. Only in July his 16-year-old son, Euan, was arrested after being found drunk on the pavement in Leicester Square, London. At the time he received a police reprimand but under the new scheme he would be liable for a fine. </p> <p>About 77% of the 3.4m fixed penalty fines issued for motoring offences are paid each year. The Home Office estimates that even if the amount was set at \u00a350 rather than \u00a3100, the introduction of such fines for loutish and drunken behaviour could raise \u00a324m a year. </p> <p>Nearly all the crime measures mentioned by Mr Blair in his speech have already been well trailed, including the power to close violent pubs, compulsory drug treatment for those testing positive when arrested, a new attack on organised crime, and more rights for victims, including introduction of victim impact statements in court cases. </p> <p>The prime minister hinted at further changes to come when he talked of tightening up bail conditions so that those released by the courts in the morning could not commit offences in the afternoon. Alan Travis </p> <p><b> Sport</b><br> </p> <p> Up to \u00a31bn is to be spent on new sports facilities at schools across the country as the government attempts to lift sporting standards throughout Britain. </p> <p>Tony Blair announced yesterday that \u00a3750m of lottery money will go towards the facilities, which will include astroturf pitches, tennis courts and indoor and outdoor cricket pitches. </p> <p>The prime minister told the conference: \"Today we set out plans to invest \u00a3750m of lottery money in schools and commmunity sport as part of a \u00a31bn investment over three years. This is not just a sports policy. It's a health policy, an education policy, an anti-crime policy, an anti-drugs policy.\" </p> <p>The ambitious scheme, which will benefit 1,500 schools, was drawn up with the help of the chairman of Sport England, Trevor Brooking, who flew from the Olympics in Sydney to attend yesterday's conference. </p> <p>The prime minister hopes to emulate the \"mille piscines\" policy adopted by France in the 1960s and 1970s, when huge sums were pumped into sports facilities. The improved facilities raised French sporting standards as well as improving the health of schoolchildren. </p> <p>The British scheme will pay for new sports halls, synthetic pitches, athletic facilities, tennis courts, football and rugby pitches and indoor and outdoor cricket pitches. The investment will also fund improvements to existing sports halls and playing fields. </p> <p>The New Opportunities fund, which helps to distribute lottery money said outdoor adventure and sporting facilities and equipment should no longer be a luxury that few can afford. </p> <p>The chairwoman, Lady Pitkeathley, said: \"Educational and sporting opportunities for schools with wider community use is an excellent means of ploughing lottery funding back into localities in a way that fosters community spirit in its widest sense and builds self confidence.\" </p> <p>British sports stars, including successful Olympic athletes, welcomed the new funding for sports facilities in schools. </p> <p>Steve Redgrave, the rowing gold medallist, said: \"We must encourage youngsters to be keen about sport which has been neglected in schools for too long.\" </p> <p>Jason Queally, cycling gold medallist said: \"All successful sporting nations have the roots of their success in school sport and I hope there will now be an increase in the choice of sports.\" </p> <p>A consultation paper will be published soon and proposals will be drawn up towards the end of the year.

All schools will get some money for repairs, funnelled directly to schools: 600 will be either rebuilt or completely transformed. Mr Blunkett will also promise to deliver more direct funding to schools, cutting local authorities out of the loop, which will annoy them but please head teachers. The government will just achieve its target on spending as a share of national income - on this measure, only this year will spending beat John Major's last year, and then only by 0.1% to 4.8%. But spending will start to rise from next year and is, on government estimates, set to increase education's share of national income to 5.3% by 2004. But, assuming that the economy continues to growth, Mr Blair's promise will mean hefty extra sums beyond then. And it gives the education secretary considerable leverage with the chancellor. Mr Blunkett came out reasonably well in the spending review, but argued hard in private with Gordon Brown and was upset not to have won more. He last night summoned the spirit of Britain's Olympic success to promote the specialist schools which specialise in sports, arts, languages or technology. Mr Blair massaged the teachers - like our doctors and armed forces, they were the best in the world. \"Education is the passion of this government,\" he said. John Dunford, general secretary of the Secondary Heads Association, welcomed Mr Blair's pledges, though he was anxious about the new targets. Extra money for ICT was essential because in five years' time existing school computers would be obsolete. Mr Blunkett is concerned to bridge the \"digital divide\". But Mr Dunford noted the extra specialist schools, which the government believes is creating excellence and diversity, but which others in Labour ranks, including Lord Hattersley at a fringe meeting yesterday, regard as an extension of the two-tier state education system. Will Woodward Crime The police are to be given the power to issue \u00a3100 fixed penalty fines to anyone found drunk in public or indulging in loutish disorderly behaviour as the main plank of Tony Blair's promise yesterday that it was time for \"zero tolerance of yob culture\". The new scheme has dropped all plans to \"march drunken youths to the nearest cashpoint\", as Mr Blair once suggested, and instead police will issue \u00a3100 tickets in the same way that parking fines are handed with the possibility of contesting the case before a magistrates' court. A Home Office consultation document published after Mr Blair's speech indicates that ministers are proposing that 16- and 17-year-olds as well as adults should be liable for the new \u00a3100 fines and those who repeat the offence within six months will face even heavier penalties. Ministers also believe there is \"a strong case for an automatic increase in the level of the penalty if the fine is not paid within a certain number of days.\" Under the new power the police will be able to fine people for a wide range of disorderly behaviour offences, including drunkenness in public, abusive or insulting behaviour, buying alcohol by or on behalf of under 18s, drinking in public places and minor cases of criminal damage, including spray-painting graffiti. Police will also be given power to arrest anyone who refuses to provide evidence of their name or address. Mr Blair said the new fines were needed because he was determined to deal firmly with the type of loutish behaviour, often fuelled by alcohol, which, he said, had become commonplace in villages, towns and cities. \"Fixed penalty notices will enable the police to deal effectively and speedily with minor offences of public drunkeness and disorder, while reducing the the time they have to spend on paperwork,\" said the prime minister. Mr Blair's tough words will echo in the corridors of his own home. Only in July his 16-year-old son, Euan, was arrested after being found drunk on the pavement in Leicester Square, London. At the time he received a police reprimand but under the new scheme he would be liable for a fine. About 77% of the 3.4m fixed penalty fines issued for motoring offences are paid each year. The Home Office estimates that even if the amount was set at \u00a350 rather than \u00a3100, the introduction of such fines for loutish and drunken behaviour could raise \u00a324m a year. Nearly all the crime measures mentioned by Mr Blair in his speech have already been well trailed, including the power to close violent pubs, compulsory drug treatment for those testing positive when arrested, a new attack on organised crime, and more rights for victims, including introduction of victim impact statements in court cases. The prime minister hinted at further changes to come when he talked of tightening up bail conditions so that those released by the courts in the morning could not commit offences in the afternoon. Alan Travis Sport Up to \u00a31bn is to be spent on new sports facilities at schools across the country as the government attempts to lift sporting standards throughout Britain. Tony Blair announced yesterday that \u00a3750m of lottery money will go towards the facilities, which will include astroturf pitches, tennis courts and indoor and outdoor cricket pitches. The prime minister told the conference: \"Today we set out plans to invest \u00a3750m of lottery money in schools and commmunity sport as part of a \u00a31bn investment over three years. This is not just a sports policy. It's a health policy, an education policy, an anti-crime policy, an anti-drugs policy.\" The ambitious scheme, which will benefit 1,500 schools, was drawn up with the help of the chairman of Sport England, Trevor Brooking, who flew from the Olympics in Sydney to attend yesterday's conference. The prime minister hopes to emulate the \"mille piscines\" policy adopted by France in the 1960s and 1970s, when huge sums were pumped into sports facilities. The improved facilities raised French sporting standards as well as improving the health of schoolchildren. The British scheme will pay for new sports halls, synthetic pitches, athletic facilities, tennis courts, football and rugby pitches and indoor and outdoor cricket pitches. The investment will also fund improvements to existing sports halls and playing fields. The New Opportunities fund, which helps to distribute lottery money said outdoor adventure and sporting facilities and equipment should no longer be a luxury that few can afford. The chairwoman, Lady Pitkeathley, said: \"Educational and sporting opportunities for schools with wider community use is an excellent means of ploughing lottery funding back into localities in a way that fosters community spirit in its widest sense and builds self confidence.\" British sports stars, including successful Olympic athletes, welcomed the new funding for sports facilities in schools. Steve Redgrave, the rowing gold medallist, said: \"We must encourage youngsters to be keen about sport which has been neglected in schools for too long.\" Jason Queally, cycling gold medallist said: \"All successful sporting nations have the roots of their success in school sport and I hope there will now be an increase in the choice of sports.\" A consultation paper will be published soon and proposals will be drawn up towards the end of the year.

The bigger surprise was saved for the minister left waiting for his speech.</p> <p>\u0095 The minister could al ways have asked Barbara Follett for the speech she failed to deliver yesterday. Sitting in the hall hoping to be called, she showed how far has been her fall from grace since hubby Ken took a swipe at the prime minster. The speech started with a very old Labour \"Good morning, comrades.\" As time ticked by and the chair turned a Nelsonian eye, she updated it to \"Good afternoon, comrades\". Touchingly for one not called, the next line said she had come to conference for 20 years and never succeeded in being called.</p> <p>\u0095 After grabbing a volume on Nelson Mandela to produce a photo pass, security chiefs have now made one for Michael Foot by using a picture of the former Labour leader in his biography of Nye Bevan.

      "bodyText": "\u0095 Police are hunting new Labour's \"Mr Big\" after Tonytown's first recorded crime. The Family Planning Association's condom demonstrator was stolen overnight from its stand in the hotel Tony Blair is staying in. The rigid piece of red rubber, about 12 inches long, was discovered missing by assocation staff at 8.30am yesterday. Given the tight security on the mini-state's borders, officers suspect it was an inside job. \u0095 The tranquillity of Tonytown has also been broken by the mysterious case of the missing ministerial speech. A porter in Blair's hotel was frantically knocking on doors, asking residents if they had taken delivery of a suprise package. The bigger surprise was saved for the minister left waiting for his speech. \u0095 The minister could al ways have asked Barbara Follett for the speech she failed to deliver yesterday. Sitting in the hall hoping to be called, she showed how far has been her fall from grace since hubby Ken took a swipe at the prime minster. The speech started with a very old Labour \"Good morning, comrades.\" As time ticked by and the chair turned a Nelsonian eye, she updated it to \"Good afternoon, comrades\". Touchingly for one not called, the next line said she had come to conference for 20 years and never succeeded in being called. \u0095 After grabbing a volume on Nelson Mandela to produce a photo pass, security chiefs have now made one for Michael Foot by using a picture of the former Labour leader in his biography of Nye Bevan. Fortunately, Footie looked 87 back in the 1960s when he wrote the book. \u0095 Gordon Brown delayed his return to the Czech Republic and IMF cashfest until yesterday morning, overnighting in Tonytown to sort out his pension problems. \"I'm off back to Prague,\" huffed the chancellor, \"because there are fewer protesters.\"",

      "byline": "Melvyn Bragg",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>In the middle of the last century, Nye Bevan was the people's champion. Into the lists he rode, out of the valleys of death, lancing the opposition with his scorn, his wit, his marvellous eloquence. The only one of ours able to take on Churchill who had won the war but brought out the troops against the Welsh miners. Bevan had been a miner and his revenge could get the better of him. \"Lower than vermin,\" he called the Tories and their press lynched him. Boys adopt heroes easily but it is very rare for a politician to qualify. Nye Bevan did. </p> <p>We relished his melodious oratory, we swallowed whole tall tales of his innate aristocracy (unaware of irony) - he would starve himself for days on end, we told each other, to save up for one really fine meal. He could recite volumes of poetry by heart, understand science and when he spoke in the House of Commons the assembly looked on with awe as at the young Jesus. </p> <p>But above all he was one of us. He had risen from the pits to the dispatch box and many of us wished that he had gained the leadership. I still think of it as a crucially missed opportunity not only for the Labour party but for the country. He would have brought so much that was new and fresh to leadership. The middle-class socialists who had taken over the parliamentary party (which Bevan rightly saw as the real engine of power) had brought much to the table. Bevan, however, provided what will certainly be the last real chance for a true working-class hero to become a national leader. </p> <p>The personal qualities he would have brought to it came from a sensibility in the majority but never in the ascendance in this country - what, not too inaccurately, could be called educated working class: but the education bedded in the working. </p> <p>Nye Bevan knew about the hard unpleasant labour which was the lot of most men and many women at the time he had done it. He knew the value of learning - he had struggled for it in the few leisure hours above ground. He knew about the richness and potential buried in the massed neglect of working-class life. He had seen it all around him. And he knew about the collective will, the strength of communality, the essential importance of democracy and the absolute necessity for change. </p> <p>Strong leaders make governments and influence the tone and sometimes the character of the country, I believe, and the personality of Bevan would have inspired that major part of our society which still appears to lack the confidence and high ambition found in comparable countries. He would, I think, in his policies and by his example have elevated the condition and the motivation of those thought well below the salt. He would have brought the best of working-class qualities and culture to this country at a time particularly ripe for it. </p> <p>Just as Churchill represented and helped to release one sort of Britishness in 1940 and Thatcher another in the 80s, so Bevan could have given political expression to that movement of enfranchisement of the many, which characterised the culture of the late 50s and 60s. We have never had a man of the people to lead the people. His death prevented what could have been a very un-British triumph. </p> <p>His critics will cite against him his belief in the state occupying the commanding the heights of the economy as proof that he would have led the country into the hopeless prison of socialism. But at that time politicians across the parties went along with nationalisation. Even now it could be argued that had some of those heights of the British economy been given the intelligence and the investment afforded them by their counterparts elsewhere - France for instance - then they would be rather more commanding than what has replaced them. </p> <p>The chief point I would make though is that Bevan was perpetually aware that things must change. Had he seen poverty threatening because wealth producing was being denied he would certainly have reshaped his policies as so many others did. </p> <p>It is the National Health Service which is his monument, and an intriguing one. It is regularly portrayed now as run down, terminally gone to seed, probably irrelevant to modern demands. In short, Bevan's monument is falling down. Some of its faults have been there since the 40s. The power and masonic arrogance of some of the senior medical men is continuing proof of that deep strain of resistance to the whole enterprise which grew up in the 40s and has never gone away. There were those who said, and were reported and applauded for saying it, that we had fought the Nazis to stop the sort of thing Bevan was doing with the nation's health. </p> <p>There is also the matter of those 18 years of Conservative neglect which just cannot be reversed in two or three years. </p> <p>But there are other ways in which Bevan's NHS seems to be at bay. People are living longer, and need more care. Science provides cures which can be hugely expensive and, so it goes, the system of half a century ago built for less healthy days is rapidly becoming insupportable. There is more. The rise of the insecure job-changing individual crossed with an increasingly global economy is at odds with the ethos and delivery of a system built in less demanding, better drilled times.

      "bodyText": "In the middle of the last century, Nye Bevan was the people's champion. Into the lists he rode, out of the valleys of death, lancing the opposition with his scorn, his wit, his marvellous eloquence. The only one of ours able to take on Churchill who had won the war but brought out the troops against the Welsh miners. Bevan had been a miner and his revenge could get the better of him. \"Lower than vermin,\" he called the Tories and their press lynched him. Boys adopt heroes easily but it is very rare for a politician to qualify. Nye Bevan did. We relished his melodious oratory, we swallowed whole tall tales of his innate aristocracy (unaware of irony) - he would starve himself for days on end, we told each other, to save up for one really fine meal. He could recite volumes of poetry by heart, understand science and when he spoke in the House of Commons the assembly looked on with awe as at the young Jesus. But above all he was one of us. He had risen from the pits to the dispatch box and many of us wished that he had gained the leadership. I still think of it as a crucially missed opportunity not only for the Labour party but for the country. He would have brought so much that was new and fresh to leadership. The middle-class socialists who had taken over the parliamentary party (which Bevan rightly saw as the real engine of power) had brought much to the table. Bevan, however, provided what will certainly be the last real chance for a true working-class hero to become a national leader. The personal qualities he would have brought to it came from a sensibility in the majority but never in the ascendance in this country - what, not too inaccurately, could be called educated working class: but the education bedded in the working. Nye Bevan knew about the hard unpleasant labour which was the lot of most men and many women at the time he had done it. He knew the value of learning - he had struggled for it in the few leisure hours above ground. He knew about the richness and potential buried in the massed neglect of working-class life. He had seen it all around him. And he knew about the collective will, the strength of communality, the essential importance of democracy and the absolute necessity for change. Strong leaders make governments and influence the tone and sometimes the character of the country, I believe, and the personality of Bevan would have inspired that major part of our society which still appears to lack the confidence and high ambition found in comparable countries. He would, I think, in his policies and by his example have elevated the condition and the motivation of those thought well below the salt. He would have brought the best of working-class qualities and culture to this country at a time particularly ripe for it. Just as Churchill represented and helped to release one sort of Britishness in 1940 and Thatcher another in the 80s, so Bevan could have given political expression to that movement of enfranchisement of the many, which characterised the culture of the late 50s and 60s. We have never had a man of the people to lead the people. His death prevented what could have been a very un-British triumph. His critics will cite against him his belief in the state occupying the commanding the heights of the economy as proof that he would have led the country into the hopeless prison of socialism. But at that time politicians across the parties went along with nationalisation. Even now it could be argued that had some of those heights of the British economy been given the intelligence and the investment afforded them by their counterparts elsewhere - France for instance - then they would be rather more commanding than what has replaced them. The chief point I would make though is that Bevan was perpetually aware that things must change. Had he seen poverty threatening because wealth producing was being denied he would certainly have reshaped his policies as so many others did. It is the National Health Service which is his monument, and an intriguing one. It is regularly portrayed now as run down, terminally gone to seed, probably irrelevant to modern demands. In short, Bevan's monument is falling down. Some of its faults have been there since the 40s. The power and masonic arrogance of some of the senior medical men is continuing proof of that deep strain of resistance to the whole enterprise which grew up in the 40s and has never gone away. There were those who said, and were reported and applauded for saying it, that we had fought the Nazis to stop the sort of thing Bevan was doing with the nation's health. There is also the matter of those 18 years of Conservative neglect which just cannot be reversed in two or three years. But there are other ways in which Bevan's NHS seems to be at bay. People are living longer, and need more care. Science provides cures which can be hugely expensive and, so it goes, the system of half a century ago built for less healthy days is rapidly becoming insupportable. There is more. The rise of the insecure job-changing individual crossed with an increasingly global economy is at odds with the ethos and delivery of a system built in less demanding, better drilled times. In fact, so this argument goes, socialism will inevitably go the way of Soviet communism, and this marxist NHS, \"to each according to his needs\", is increasingly marooned in a world view and context far away from the insatiable society of today. But the oddest thing of all is that despite all this, all the evidence, all the portents, all the complaints, we as a country want Nye Bevan's NHS. We believe in it and cry out most loudly to make it as good as Bevan wanted it to be. In building the NHS, he did what the greatest politicians do: he met the deepest needs of the people he served. Another conclusion I draw from this is that Bevan found a brilliant way to smuggle his own version of Welsh Labour party socialism through the capitalist triumphalism of the 20th century. The British do indeed want their health service to take care of them \"from the cradle to the grave\" and they have a faith in the system's potential to do so which defies the often crumbling reality. Bevan's health service is still called upon to be democratically available to all and equally. To pay no regard to status, income or class but only to need.

So how come commercial contracts have been let or are close to letting for it in Germany, Italy, Switzerland, Holland and Spain, and that it is under trial in Hungary, Austria and France? The European technical standards for interoperability (TSIs) are all but finalised and other countries, apparently more concerned about railway safety than we are, have no difficulty in following them. No other European country is wasting half a billion pounds installing an inferior system. The train protection and warning system (TPWS), currently being fitted in Britain, does not work on trains going faster than 74mph and is not computerised. European ATP has many well-known engineering suppliers in competition, whereas we in Britain will be at the mercy of one supplier for TPWS. My clients, the bereaved and injured of Southall and Ladbroke Grove, know that TPWS would not have prevented Southall and will not prevent more high-speed crashes in the future, which are precisely those that cause the most casualties. For this reason they want the government and the railway industry to abandon TPWS and install European ATP as quickly as possible. Louise Christian Southall and Ladbroke Grove Solicitors' Group",

I paid for the duck myself; I wouldn't have minded if it had got a laugh, but it got no laughs at all, so I thought sod it.\" Liz Rutherford, a director of Janimals 2, the firm which provided George the duck, said the charges were reasonable because ducks required training, insurance and a handler at all times. \"You cannot just go and haul any old duck off a pond to do this type of work,\" she said.",

Vojislav Kostunica, the opposition leader, has already said he will accept nothing less than a first-round victory. With 97% of the votes counted, the Democratic Opposition of Serbia said yesterday that by its unofficial tally Mr Kostunica had 54.6% and Slobodan Milosevic 35%. This result was supported by both the Belgrade-based Cen tre for Free Elections and Democracy and the far-right Serbian Radical party which ran its own candidate and is still nominally part of President Milosevic's coalition. Cedomir Jovanovic, the opposition spokesman, said: \"It is absolutely certain we have won, and so we request the federal election commission to erase all suspicion and not misuse this critical situation.\" He called on Mr Milosevic's Socialist party of Serbia and the Yugoslav United Left party to respect the popular will and cede power. If this did not happen, he said the opposition would protest peacefully. Meanwhile Miroslav Hristodulo, deputy president of the Social Democratic Union, said before yesterday's runoff announcement that if the election commission denied Mr Kostunica outright victory, nightly demonstrations would take place from tomorrow. Asked about the future of Serbian hardliners who have been indicted by the international criminal tribunal in the Hague, he said Mr Kostunica's plan was retribution rather than revenge. There would be proper law and proper trials, he said. Few observers believed that the opposition would come together so smoothly to give the country's disillusioned voters a respected figure to support. Massive campaigns to mobilise voters were organised by non-governmental groups, women's organisations and the student resistance group Otpor. Another opposition tactic - to provide an efficient and credible vote-reporting service - caught the Milosevic regime off guard. Politika, a pro-government newspaper, published partial local election results yesterday that noted opposition victories in many towns. A Socialist party spokesman, Ivica Dacic, also admitted at a press conference that the government had lost some towns, but declared its overwhelming victory in parliamentary elections. He made no mention of the presidential poll. Some saw this as a sign that the government would eventually back down. \"If they have already recognised such a crushing defeat in all the municipalities, there is no chance for them to tamper with other results now,\" said Mladjan Dinkic, coordinator of the G-17 Plus group of academics and professionals.

Experts at the Institute for Fiscal Studies estimate that raising the assumption of the trend rate of growth would give the chancellor an extra \u00a31.4bn to play with in next year's Budget and \u00a32.8bn the following year. </p> <p>But in reality the public coffers are awash with cash and the government has already pencilled in big rises in spending on health, education and transport in coming years so has no need to pull any book-keeping stunt to give itself any more money.</p>",

Laying out his goal of beefing up Britain's growth rate over the next four years as part of a nationwide drive to increase productivity, Mr Brown said that - although the economy had consistently outperformed pessimistic Treasury assumptions - it was too soon to plan spending on a more generous trend growth rate. \"We will not fall into the trap of basing our approach to economic policy including fiscal policy on the potential for improvement in trend growth before this has been demonstrably achieved,\" Mr Brown told delegates at the World Bank and International Monetary Fund annual meetings in Prague. \"So we will continue over the coming year with the same deliberately prudent approach to the public finances.\" There had been speculation that, with an election likely next year, Mr Brown would increase the estimate of the sustainable growth rate for planning the public finances to 2.5%, the growth rate the Treasury considers to be consistent with non-inflationary long term growth. But, in a reference to the \"boom and bust\" of the late 1980s which led to the largest ever peace time deficit, Mr Brown declared: \"We will not make the old British mistake of assuming that a cyclical improvement in the public fi nances automatically means a structural improvement.\" Shortly after the general election, Labour cut the estimate of the trend rate of growth from the 2.5% figure which the Conservatives used to plan public finances to 2.25%. The Treasury's goal is to raise the sustainable growth rate to 2.75% over the next four years, an objective which Mr Brown said was achievable. The Chancellor said Britain had much to learn from the American economy, which has enjoyed high growth, low inflation and rising productivity for most of the 1990s. \"It [the US] has shown how combining stability and fiscal prudence with high levels of investment, particularly in the new information technologies, can lead to sustained productivity improvements and more higher skilled employment. \"Our challenge is through a national productivity drive to bridge the 30% gap with our competitors which still exists.\" An upward revision to the trend growth assumption would have the effect of swelling Treasury coffers because it would allow a lower forecast for unemployment and welfare spending and a higher forecast for tax receipts. Experts at the Institute for Fiscal Studies estimate that raising the assumption of the trend rate of growth would give the chancellor an extra \u00a31.4bn to play with in next year's Budget and \u00a32.8bn the following year. But in reality the public coffers are awash with cash and the government has already pencilled in big rises in spending on health, education and transport in coming years so has no need to pull any book-keeping stunt to give itself any more money.",

      "trailText": "<p>Lyn Gardner  meets the double act who cracked the secret of regional theatre.</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The time has come to stop writing the obituary of regional theatre. The Arts Council's promise to inject \u00a337m in additional funding, in-sufficient though it is, has helped to create a psychological transformation in an area that had suffered 20 years of underfunding. But even before the news came through, there were signs that plenty of regional theatres were no longer going to sit around waiting to be put out of their misery. </p> <p>At Northern Stage at Newcastle Playhouse, Alan Lyddiard, inspired by the work of Peter Brook, Alain Platel and Lev Dodin of the Maly, has created an ensemble to match the National Theatre's. What's more, in his productions of A Clockwork Orange, a factory-style Romeo and Juliet and the current The Ballroom of Romance, he has created a body of work with wide appeal that speaks directly to its community. Audiences have risen by 20%. </p> <p>At the Octagon in Bolton, where Lawrence Till had been doing such unsung work for so long, the local community suddenly woke up to the fact that if they didn't use it they'd lose it and mounted a fierce campaign to save the theatre as a producing venue. </p> <p>Part of the new optimism is simply the result of musical chairs: Till's move to Watford and Giles Croft's to Nottingham Playhouse. At Sheffield, Michael Grandage, whose As You Like It topped anything the RSC could offer last season, is now spearheading the artistic vision, and Joseph Fiennes has committed to playing Edward II there in the spring. </p> <p>But it is in Colchester, not renowned as a hotbed of theatrical innovation, that the greatest miracle has taken place. Two years ago the Mercury was teetering on the brink of closure, and hardly seemed worth saving. It's still not out of the woods, but it is held in respect by its local community and seen as a beacon of hope by other regional theatres. Its transformation is a lesson in how the survival of regional theatre is about not just money but also the will and the vision to reinvent yourself. </p> <p>Two years ago I went to a press conference about the new plans for the Mercury. There was only me and a man from The Stage there. The Mercury's new chief executive, Dee Evans, talked about the theatre's \"do or die\", artistically led policy. There would be no more productions of Shirley Valentine put on simply because a one-woman show means only one cast member has to be paid. </p> <p>Instead, the Mercury would create a small company of actors and stage plays that Evans and her artistic associate Gregory Floy had a passion for. I remember leaving the press conference admiring their guts but suspecting that nine months or so hence I'd be hearing of the theatre's demise. </p> <p>I was wrong. That first season included What the Butler Saw, the British premiere of Eric Emanuel Schmidt's Don Juan on Trial, and an excellent Uncle Vanya. The next offered a well-reviewed Richard III and A Streetcar Named Desire; the one after, The Duchess of Malfi and a witty The Provok'd Wife. Audiences for classic drama have risen by 38%, proving that art and audiences are not mutually exclusive. This autumn they can see The Crucible and Waiting for Godot. \"I think that we and our audience are just about ready for Beckett,\" says Floy, and indeed advance sales are looking good. </p> <p>Recognition of the theatre's new lease of life has come with funding and support from the local council and, a year ago, \u00a3350,000 recovery funding from the Arts Council. It is the first theatre to receive such money. </p> <p>Like Alan Lyddiard at Northern Stage, Evans and Floy realised that one of the problems with most regional theatres was that actors had become the least valued, least well- paid and least permanent members of the team. Years of crisis had seen the numbers of administrative and marketing staff increase, while less and less money was spent on production and performances.

      "bodyText": "The time has come to stop writing the obituary of regional theatre. The Arts Council's promise to inject \u00a337m in additional funding, in-sufficient though it is, has helped to create a psychological transformation in an area that had suffered 20 years of underfunding. But even before the news came through, there were signs that plenty of regional theatres were no longer going to sit around waiting to be put out of their misery. At Northern Stage at Newcastle Playhouse, Alan Lyddiard, inspired by the work of Peter Brook, Alain Platel and Lev Dodin of the Maly, has created an ensemble to match the National Theatre's. What's more, in his productions of A Clockwork Orange, a factory-style Romeo and Juliet and the current The Ballroom of Romance, he has created a body of work with wide appeal that speaks directly to its community. Audiences have risen by 20%. At the Octagon in Bolton, where Lawrence Till had been doing such unsung work for so long, the local community suddenly woke up to the fact that if they didn't use it they'd lose it and mounted a fierce campaign to save the theatre as a producing venue. Part of the new optimism is simply the result of musical chairs: Till's move to Watford and Giles Croft's to Nottingham Playhouse. At Sheffield, Michael Grandage, whose As You Like It topped anything the RSC could offer last season, is now spearheading the artistic vision, and Joseph Fiennes has committed to playing Edward II there in the spring. But it is in Colchester, not renowned as a hotbed of theatrical innovation, that the greatest miracle has taken place. Two years ago the Mercury was teetering on the brink of closure, and hardly seemed worth saving. It's still not out of the woods, but it is held in respect by its local community and seen as a beacon of hope by other regional theatres. Its transformation is a lesson in how the survival of regional theatre is about not just money but also the will and the vision to reinvent yourself. Two years ago I went to a press conference about the new plans for the Mercury. There was only me and a man from The Stage there. The Mercury's new chief executive, Dee Evans, talked about the theatre's \"do or die\", artistically led policy. There would be no more productions of Shirley Valentine put on simply because a one-woman show means only one cast member has to be paid. Instead, the Mercury would create a small company of actors and stage plays that Evans and her artistic associate Gregory Floy had a passion for. I remember leaving the press conference admiring their guts but suspecting that nine months or so hence I'd be hearing of the theatre's demise. I was wrong. That first season included What the Butler Saw, the British premiere of Eric Emanuel Schmidt's Don Juan on Trial, and an excellent Uncle Vanya. The next offered a well-reviewed Richard III and A Streetcar Named Desire; the one after, The Duchess of Malfi and a witty The Provok'd Wife. Audiences for classic drama have risen by 38%, proving that art and audiences are not mutually exclusive. This autumn they can see The Crucible and Waiting for Godot. \"I think that we and our audience are just about ready for Beckett,\" says Floy, and indeed advance sales are looking good. Recognition of the theatre's new lease of life has come with funding and support from the local council and, a year ago, \u00a3350,000 recovery funding from the Arts Council. It is the first theatre to receive such money. Like Alan Lyddiard at Northern Stage, Evans and Floy realised that one of the problems with most regional theatres was that actors had become the least valued, least well- paid and least permanent members of the team. Years of crisis had seen the numbers of administrative and marketing staff increase, while less and less money was spent on production and performances. When Evans arrived at the Mercury, an actor playing a lead role could expect to be paid the same weekly wage as the wardrobe assistant. The lack of value theatre places on actors was also one of the things that Lyddiard set out to right when he founded the Northern Stage ensemble in 1997. Evans is not against marketing; she simply points out that \"you can't market rubbish. Well, you can, but the audience won't come back a second time.\" The Mercury's strategy has been to invest in productions and actors: each season now begins with a training week for the performers, a move that initially met with some resistance from the actors, who saw it as remedial work, but is now welcomed. The ensemble this session consists of 18 actors: 12 who have previously been at Colchester - and six newcomers. \"We didn't want to go back to the old rep company idea,\" explains Evans. \"Having the same company from year to year can be stultifying.\" Instead the theatre through-casts a season as much as possible and involves everyone in education and community work. The actor who leads a school workshop will be the same one that plays Richard III. Underlying all this is a belief in the role of the artist in society. One of the desperate things about regional theatre in recent years is that it has crushed the artistic vision out of those involved. For many, meeting performance targets, balancing the books and justifying the subsidy have become a raison d' tre rather than a by-product of a thriving theatre. Evans firmly believes that we need regional theatres such as the Mercury because they contribute to the desire, articulated by the philosopher RG Collingwood, \"that most people want a better life\". If that means making money by doing some canny co-productions with commercial managements, so be it, but it also means putting the theatre at the heart of the community.

      "body": "<p>In Theodore Roszak's 1991 novel Flicker - a wonderfully mind-bending paranoid thriller about cinema history - the future, and the end, of film is discovered in the shape of a teenage auteur called Simon Dunkle. He is the nihilistic genius behind avant-garde horror works such as Insect Anxiety and the apocalyptic Sub Sub, a film said to initiate a new genre, \"genocidal farce\". Dunkle outdoes even these with The Lonesome Lovesong of the Sad Sewer Babies, a work so disturbing that the novel's narrator deems it not so much a movie as \"a kind of optical acid that burns through from the eye straight down into the vital organs\". </p> <p>Flicker proposed the horrifying, yet strangely thrilling, possibility that cinema would soon belong to lawless infant-savants like Simon Dunkle. We haven't really seen one yet - even Harmony Korine seems too benignly cinephilic to qualify. However, I can think of one film-maker who has consistently been disturbing enough to come close to the Dunkle aesthetic, and that is Chris Cunningham, the British music video director whose work features in the Royal Academy's Apocalypse show. </p> <p>The exhibition's subtitle is Beauty and Horror in Contemporary Art, and Cunningham is familiar with both. He has done futuristic beauty in the video for Bjork's All Is Full of Love, with the star playing two auto-erotic porcelain robots. And he has done horror in his videos for Aphex Twin, in which swarms of delinquent brats and siliconed hip-hop molls all wear the distorted features of Aphex mastermind Richard James. These grotesquely comic vignettes are not only the antithesis of MTV-friendly, they are unfriendly, period. And they make you want to see - and shudder at the thought of seeing - a feature film made by this man. </p> <p>Instead, Cunningham has taken a detour into the art world, and now exhibits at the Anthony d'Offay Gallery. But his 15-minute film, Flex, showing there and in Apocalypse, is surprisingly low-key. A naked man and woman, lit in bilious green, confront each other in darkness, exchange brutal volleys of blows, screw just as convulsively, and finally, coupling in mid-air, are struck by a ray of light that vaporises them. Who would have imagined Cunningham producing romantic abstraction of such a transcendentalist strain? </p> <p>Flex is less disturbing than it seems on paper - a coupling of brutality and beauty. What makes it transcend the apparent banality of its topic is the execution, the meticulous sound design and machine-gun editing. It's a work to be heard and felt as much as seen. </p> <p>Cunningham began as a teenage special-effects expert, working on Alien 3 and Stanley Kubrick's abortive AI project. He is not alone: sculptor Ron Mueck was a movie animatronics specialist (he also worked on Alien 3), and he too is currently at Anthony d'Offay with his waxily lifelike human figures. </p> <p>Mueck and Cunningham have moved from what you could patronise as the merely \"lifelike\" to work that strives to address the human condition. But you shouldn't dismiss the visceral impetus of effects work. The purest example I ever saw was a stall at a Spanish horror film festival. It was laden with hundreds of latex horror models - all gouged eyes, severed limbs, ripped bellies disgorging rubbery entrails. You fairly retched to look at them, but you could hardly take your eyes away. </p> <p>We usually expect art proper to demand a more complex reaction than that, but in fact one work in the Apocalypse exhibition made me react quite similarly to the Spanish atrocity exhibition - Hell, Jake and Dinos Chapman's Holocaust installation. However repelled I felt, I couldn't stop peering at it; yet that fascination stood in the way of any coherent critical reaction to it. </p> <p>At Apocalypse, Chris Cunningham and Jake and Dinos have somehow reversed career paths. The former sci-fi robotics nerd has moved away from pure effect into a more contemplative, impressionistic realm. Meanwhile, the Chapmans have reverted to teenage special-effects artists with their meticulously constructed Airfix landscape of horror. Hell, their very own \"genocidal farce\", makes them the true Simon Dunkles.</p> <p>Chris Cunningham and Ron Mueck are at the Anthony d'Offay Gallery, W1 (020-7499 4100) till October 17. Apocalypse is at the Royal Academy, W1 (020-7300 8000) till December 15.</p>",

The last, and smallest, room in the bungalow contains everything else associated with having a house: a sofa-bed, a desk and one chair, a few records and tapes, some shelves of books - nearly all of them about the blues and their place in American culture. There's a guitar and a painting, and though both a man and a woman live here, there is nothing that is not hard and dedicated to the cold eye. Nothing is out of balance. Nothing serves as a distraction. Here lives a man who walks a narrow road with an utterly medieval sense of mortality. Which is as well, since one of Robert Kidney's kidneys failed 10 years ago, and now his other kidney barely copes, and when he speaks to you it's like the Icelanders do, up close, too close, with his eyes locked on to yours past the bounds of anything that might be called comfortable. There is no time to waste. </p> <p>Robert Kidney is the guitarist/ singer/leader of a band called 15-60-75. It's a blues band. Of a sort. But where the guardians of the form have starved it of innovation, 15-60-75 nurtured abstract evolution. They play blues reimbued with meaning, purged and purified by flame, shorn of every superfluous moment, sound or word. </p> <p>Because their songs are compiled across a series of markers - words, sounds, phrases and pauses - they don't count measures and can't outline the structure of their songs to an outsider. For the blues, a form routinely approached as a compendium of formulas, this is startling, and it means that any change of personnel necessitates months of not just relearning but rewriting every song. It is a methodology from another planet - Don Van Vliet and Sun Ra come to mind. It is form dedicated to vision. </p> <p>The band are from Kent, Ohio, a small college town 40 miles south of Cleveland. In 1970, on the campus of Kent State University, four students were killed by National Guardsmen during a demonstration against the Vietnam war. Neil Young wrote a song about it. Robert Kidney started a band, and for its name chose a set of numbers with numerological significance, but he also chose numbers to suggest Orwellian political darkness. Later, somebody in the band noticed that those numbers described a 1-4-5 ratio which happens to be the progression on which the blues are based, and so the group are also called the Numbers. </p> <p>Seeing 15-60-75 for the first time in a honky-tonk on Water Street, on the other side of the railroad tracks and next to the grain silos, where for most of the last three decades they have played four sets a night, four nights a week - seeing them there is like staring into a last chrome flash of that Old America of Thoreau and Kerouac, Harry Partch and John Coltrane, Mark Twain and Robert Johnson... and rock music. </p> <p>\"The first time I saw them my hair stood on end,\" says Chris Cutler, veteran of British progressive music. \"You have to go to a small city in America to see a band with this much intensity.\" </p> <p>It's an intensity, a fire from inside that they have sustained in obscurity, without regard to reward or praise or even appreciation. </p> <p>Tales of their bad luck and misfortune are breathtaking, and watching them bleed their lives away some night, playing in front of an utterly uninterested lounge crowd at a Holiday Inn that some booking agent thought would be a good idea, cauterises any doubts. And yet the core of the group today is as it has been for 30 years - Robert, brother Jack Kidney (harp and sax) and Terry Hynde (sax). And it is a mark of the respect they engender in their fans and fellow musicians that Terry has a younger sister, Chrissie, who must, in northern Ohio at least, forever labour in his shadow.</p> <p>15-60-75 are at the Royal Festival Hall, London SE1 (020-7960 4242), tonight.

Tales of their bad luck and misfortune are breathtaking, and watching them bleed their lives away some night, playing in front of an utterly uninterested lounge crowd at a Holiday Inn that some booking agent thought would be a good idea, cauterises any doubts. And yet the core of the group today is as it has been for 30 years - Robert, brother Jack Kidney (harp and sax) and Terry Hynde (sax). And it is a mark of the respect they engender in their fans and fellow musicians that Terry has a younger sister, Chrissie, who must, in northern Ohio at least, forever labour in his shadow. 15-60-75 are at the Royal Festival Hall, London SE1 (020-7960 4242), tonight. Their first album, Jimmy Bell's Still in Town, has been reissued on Pere Ubu's Hearpen label.",

The non-specific groaning and Bontempi sleaze has been replaced with what a typically cryptic 7 calls \"sexual musique concr\u00e8te \". But though the finished product certainly has its merits, aren't there certain moral questions to be answered? \"The only time myself and co-director Jonathan Benton-Hughes had any doubts were at the casting stage\", says 7. \"We were presented with videos of quite young - though of legal age - girls being coaxed into doing things they obviously didn't want to do. Because porn has been pushed underground, it does attract a lot of unsavoury folk, and we were guilty of believing many of the publicly perceived prejudices.

      "body": "<p>Never mind This Life, <strong> Attachments</strong> (BBC2) is oddly reminiscient of Big Brother. Of the team of bright-ish, young-ish things thrown into a precarious situation, one is a lesbian, one is a skateboarder (admittedly not the same one), one is a lech and one is even duplicitous - stealing another's CV to get a job. They sit around in east London smoking and swearing, they have a webcam in their toilet, and there is plenty of naturalistic camera work. There is even a not-very-good website. There is also some slightly dodgy acting going on. And the latter notwithstanding, the characters who populate the drama will perhaps become like dear friends in the weeks to come. The first episode, however, wasn't a good start. </p> <p>Following the start-up of <a href=\"http:www.seethru.co.uk\" target\"_new\">seethru.co.uk</a> - which actually exists - it began, rather predictably, with some nudity. First, there's Brandon. He is a Louis Theroux-a-like who skateboards around the office with his bits out. From this, we can assume he is a geeky technical type who is slightly dysfunctional. Then there are Mike and Lucy, the brains behind the website. They lie on top of their duvet in their ersatz Elle Decoration room and are about to make sweet, sweet love when a phone call from the naked Brandon stops them. From this, we can assume they are passionate but businesslike. As the rest of the cast is introduced, we are laboriously spoonfed with little nuggets of their personalities, which could have been happily avoided if they had all worn t-shirts with their main characteristics on them (\"lesbian, anti-establishment, crisp-eater\", for Sophie, say). Instead, we got a procession as predictable as the nudity of the opening scenes. It's been called \"attention-grabbing\", but only if you have a very short attention span and don't get out much. </p> <p>Of course, the nudity is supposed to be \"true to life\" and no big deal. And of course, it is both. To use it in the opening sequence is hardly cutting edge. The deployment of naked people (who, in a radical move, were all thin and toned and easy on the eye) is a patronising clich\u00e9, as if the producers couldn't think of anything else to grab viewers attention. \"I know,\" they must have exclaimed. \"Let's get a bit of cock on screen within the first five minutes. That'll catch the audience's eye.\" Unfortunately, it doesn't really capture the imagination. After all, the target audience for Attachments probably see naked people quite a lot, if only themselves and their partners (in their ersatz Elle Deco bedrooms). </p> <p>Which isn't to say it all goes downhill after the naked skateboarding. In fact, Attachments shows potential, though it's hard to tell how good it will get. Lucy and Mike's relationship could be ripe for exploration, though only if they stop being quite so nice to each other. Equally, the arrival of the new sales manager, Yvonne, makes watching at least next week compulsory. The CV stealer, her presence is bound to up the ante in the oh-so-trendy office where Reece, the lech, Jake, the gay designer, Sophie and Brandon amble around. As for their relationship, there simply wasn't enough of it on display to make any judgements. For 50 minutes of drama, there wasn't an awful lot happening anywhere. Lucy might have been struggling with whether to join seethru.co.uk as planned or accept a promotion at her old job, Reece might have been anonymously sending Sophie nasty emails and Jake might have lost the entire site's contents, but even with all of that, Attachments still seemed a bit empty and undramatic. Even Joe, the scheming investor, having an embolism in the toilet didn't help matters, nor did the once new protean and naturalistic camerawork, which verged on self-parody. </p> <p>The This Life comparisons abound; Attachments probably won't match up to the (slightly inflated) opinion of that as a genuinely exciting, groundbreaking series, but hopefully it will develop into a compelling spectacle instead of a rather conspicuous drama-by-numbers set in a groovy environment to appeal to da kids. As it is, it is not as mature or well-written as The Cops - and comparisons with that are inevitable too - nor as populated with genuinely multi-faceted, fleshy characters nor as muscular plots. It is so forced a contemporary drama, it could almost be on Channel 4. While leagues ahead of much of television's dramatic offerings, it is disappointingly underwhelming. Personally, I am hoping for an upgrade.</p>",

He is a Louis Theroux-a-like who skateboards around the office with his bits out. From this, we can assume he is a geeky technical type who is slightly dysfunctional. Then there are Mike and Lucy, the brains behind the website. They lie on top of their duvet in their ersatz Elle Decoration room and are about to make sweet, sweet love when a phone call from the naked Brandon stops them. From this, we can assume they are passionate but businesslike. As the rest of the cast is introduced, we are laboriously spoonfed with little nuggets of their personalities, which could have been happily avoided if they had all worn t-shirts with their main characteristics on them (\"lesbian, anti-establishment, crisp-eater\", for Sophie, say). Instead, we got a procession as predictable as the nudity of the opening scenes. It's been called \"attention-grabbing\", but only if you have a very short attention span and don't get out much. Of course, the nudity is supposed to be \"true to life\" and no big deal. And of course, it is both. To use it in the opening sequence is hardly cutting edge. The deployment of naked people (who, in a radical move, were all thin and toned and easy on the eye) is a patronising clich\u00e9, as if the producers couldn't think of anything else to grab viewers attention. \"I know,\" they must have exclaimed. \"Let's get a bit of cock on screen within the first five minutes. That'll catch the audience's eye.\" Unfortunately, it doesn't really capture the imagination. After all, the target audience for Attachments probably see naked people quite a lot, if only themselves and their partners (in their ersatz Elle Deco bedrooms). Which isn't to say it all goes downhill after the naked skateboarding. In fact, Attachments shows potential, though it's hard to tell how good it will get. Lucy and Mike's relationship could be ripe for exploration, though only if they stop being quite so nice to each other. Equally, the arrival of the new sales manager, Yvonne, makes watching at least next week compulsory. The CV stealer, her presence is bound to up the ante in the oh-so-trendy office where Reece, the lech, Jake, the gay designer, Sophie and Brandon amble around. As for their relationship, there simply wasn't enough of it on display to make any judgements. For 50 minutes of drama, there wasn't an awful lot happening anywhere. Lucy might have been struggling with whether to join seethru.co.uk as planned or accept a promotion at her old job, Reece might have been anonymously sending Sophie nasty emails and Jake might have lost the entire site's contents, but even with all of that, Attachments still seemed a bit empty and undramatic. Even Joe, the scheming investor, having an embolism in the toilet didn't help matters, nor did the once new protean and naturalistic camerawork, which verged on self-parody. The This Life comparisons abound; Attachments probably won't match up to the (slightly inflated) opinion of that as a genuinely exciting, groundbreaking series, but hopefully it will develop into a compelling spectacle instead of a rather conspicuous drama-by-numbers set in a groovy environment to appeal to da kids. As it is, it is not as mature or well-written as The Cops - and comparisons with that are inevitable too - nor as populated with genuinely multi-faceted, fleshy characters nor as muscular plots. It is so forced a contemporary drama, it could almost be on Channel 4. While leagues ahead of much of television's dramatic offerings, it is disappointingly underwhelming. Personally, I am hoping for an upgrade.",

      "body": "<p>BP is to make a triumphant return to its Persian Gulf roots by buying a financial stake in an arm of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (Adnoc) . A deal may be signed today. </p> <p>The British oil group has agreed to take 14.67% of the Zakhum Development Company from state-owned Adnoc which it established in 1977 to operate offshore oil fields in the Gulf.

      "bodyText": "BP is to make a triumphant return to its Persian Gulf roots by buying a financial stake in an arm of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (Adnoc) . A deal may be signed today. The British oil group has agreed to take 14.67% of the Zakhum Development Company from state-owned Adnoc which it established in 1977 to operate offshore oil fields in the Gulf. The stake, analysts say, could yield $700m a year in revenue. A new company is to be set up early next month to take account of the new shareholding structure which will also see smaller stakes being controlled by TotalFinaElf (13.33%) and Japan Oil Development Company (12%). The remainder will continue to be owned by the Abu Dhabi government. BP would make no comment but Middle East sources confirmed that a formal agreement was scheduled to be signed in the next couple of days. It will give Sir John Browne, BP's chief executive, an important stepping stone to fully re-establishing the group as an important player in the oil-rich Middle East. In the early part of the century BP dominated those parts of the region which were under the protection of the British empire but Big Oil has not been welcome there for a quarter of a century. In recent years, however, the Abu Dhabi government, like other Gulf states, has been keen to find ways of squeezing more oil out of its assets and improving the industry's operating efficiency. Adnoc restructured itself last year, splitting into six divisions, and is looking at amalgamating its two other subsidiaries, Abu Dhabi Operating Company and Abu Dhabi Marine Operating Company. BP has held small stakes in them since 1978 and 1977 respectively. Other big oil producing nations such as Saudi Arabia, Iran and Kuwait have also been looking at ways of harnessing western technology and financial muscle to help them increase output. The move to let one of the top three oil groups in the world take a holding in a company that produces 450,000 barrels of oil a day is not worth large amounts of money but it has considerable political significance and is the biggest sign yet that Middle East countries are not only willing to deal with western capital but also allow it to take ownership interests again. Sir John and all his counterparts have been in Saudi Arabia recently at the government's invitation to look at ways of developing its gas fields, but the lifeblood of the Saudi economy - its oil exploration and production - will continue to remain off limits to foreign companies. BP has also been shortlisted by Kuwait to bid for projects to operate northern fields along the border with Iraq. This move comes after it signed a technical services agreement following its liberation from Iraq in 1991. BP said last month it was preparing a bid for Iran's huge Bangestan oil development in the Khuzestan province, hoping to take advantage of better relations between the US and Iran. Until now BP has concentrated its exploration and development efforts on areas such as the US Gulf and the Caspian sea, but the industry is aware the truly enormous reserves that can be exploited cheaply lie in the Gulf. The British oil group has enormous financial fire power at present on the back of very strong crude prices. Last night BP shares ended up 5.5p at 600.5p.",

Ya Basta then tried to use balloons, launching more than 500 at the police and running underneath them. The police lines held, with tear gas and batons used sporadically. In two hours the police had retreated 1.5 metres and many thousands of protesters were backed up for 12 blocks or so. </p> <p>Meanwhile the red march, led by carnivalistas and samba groups, was circling round the conference centre and trying to approach it from the south-west.

Only 2% said they had no interest in the heritage.</p> <p>Sir Neil was delighted at the overwhelming support shown by the research. \"There is a strong feeling that heritage should be preserved to be passed on to future generations,\" he said. \"This has serious implications for the way England's history and geogra phy are taught in the national curriculum and for the access and information provided by ourselves and other heritage bodies.\"</p> <p>However, there was also a warning note, in the first national attempt to gauge the attitude of of black and Asian communities, through focus group interviews. These showed many felt excluded from England's historic environment, or even unwelcome.</p> <p>Overall, many were concerned about the cost of travelling and gaining admission to historic sites, and were often more interested in the buildings and streets in their own immediate surroundings.</p> <p>There was strong support for one of the most controversial innovations of the last 10 years, the listing of post-war buildings which were often regarded as eyesores when built. Buildings recently given the grade II* listing include Park Hill housing estate in Sheffield and the Trellick tower block in west London.</p> <p>The survey showed 76% interest in modern architecture and support for the listings programme, and a majority disagreed with the statement that nothing after 1950 should be regarded as \"heritage\".</p> <p>This enthusiasm for modern architecture had increased by 10% since the last English Heritage/Mori survey in 1997.</p> <p>\"It is very encouraging that there is such overwhelming interest in our historic environment,\" Martin Cherry, English Heritage's head of listed buildings, said yesterday.</p> <p>\"The historic environment has never quite been seen, by the public or the government, as a vital part of the environment in the same way as the birds or the bees or the countryside. This survey should help to push it much further up the agenda.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "More people visited a historic attraction last year than a cinema, according to a Mori survey of attitudes to the historic environment. Over half the population, 51%, claimed to have visited a historic building or site in the past year, and the figure rose to 58% if museums were included, compared with 50% who said they had visited a cinema, and 17% who had been to a football match. The English Heritage-commissioned survey, which showed near universal belief in the importance of the historic buildings and sites if only as an educational resource - 98% said it was important for helping children and 96% for letting adults learn more about the past - came as a relief to the government's conservation adviser. Sir Neil Cossons, English Heritage chairman, and his predecessor, Sir Jocelyn Stevens, have consistently argued that the government had underestimated the importance that visitors and people in England attached to the historic environment. The survey not only supported this, but showed that a massive majority was quite happy to put taxpayers' money where its mouth was: 88% believed there should be public funding to preserve the heritage, and 76% did not agree that too much was already preserved. Only 2% said they had no interest in the heritage. Sir Neil was delighted at the overwhelming support shown by the research. \"There is a strong feeling that heritage should be preserved to be passed on to future generations,\" he said. \"This has serious implications for the way England's history and geogra phy are taught in the national curriculum and for the access and information provided by ourselves and other heritage bodies.\" However, there was also a warning note, in the first national attempt to gauge the attitude of of black and Asian communities, through focus group interviews. These showed many felt excluded from England's historic environment, or even unwelcome. Overall, many were concerned about the cost of travelling and gaining admission to historic sites, and were often more interested in the buildings and streets in their own immediate surroundings. There was strong support for one of the most controversial innovations of the last 10 years, the listing of post-war buildings which were often regarded as eyesores when built. Buildings recently given the grade II* listing include Park Hill housing estate in Sheffield and the Trellick tower block in west London. The survey showed 76% interest in modern architecture and support for the listings programme, and a majority disagreed with the statement that nothing after 1950 should be regarded as \"heritage\". This enthusiasm for modern architecture had increased by 10% since the last English Heritage/Mori survey in 1997. \"It is very encouraging that there is such overwhelming interest in our historic environment,\" Martin Cherry, English Heritage's head of listed buildings, said yesterday. \"The historic environment has never quite been seen, by the public or the government, as a vital part of the environment in the same way as the birds or the bees or the countryside. This survey should help to push it much further up the agenda.\"",

      "bodyText": "The Netherlands is going to court to challenge the excessive secrecy surrounding the EU's security and defence policies. A spokesman for the ministry of foreign affairs in the Hague confirmed that the government would appeal to the European court of human rights in Strasbourg. The move follows a decision by EU member states this summer to classify documents on military and crisis-management issues, as advances are made in forging union-wide policies. Diplomats say this is to ensure that public access to EU military activity is compatible with the strict Nato standards of secrecy, because security and defence initiatives put forward by Brussels cannot work without the active support of the western alliance. The Netherlands, along with Finland and Sweden, voted in August against the decision by EU foreign ministers to keep all such documents confidential. \"We decided to fight this because we don't believe all information should be kept secret,\" said a spokesman, Floris van Hovell. \"We want complete openness if it's possible.\" Javier Solana, the EU's foreign policy supremo, was accused of staging a \"military coup\" when the new rules were rubber-stamped in the summer. Mr Solana, a former Nato secretary general, is moving cautiously to avoid alarming both Eurosceptics and Americans, who fear that the alliance will be weakened if the union gets the military muscle to match its economic weight. \"The objection is directed against the fact that the decision excluded all such matters from freedom of information by unequivocally ruling out public access to all documents with a certain classification,\" said the Dutch government. Freedom of information campaigners have complained that Mr Solana's approach is undermining the EU's commitment in the 1997 Amsterdam treaty which enshrined the public's right of access to documents. The added restraints on access to this information have also infuriated members of the European parliament, who are discussing a much-criticised proposal by the European commission for a new code of access to meet the Amsterdam commitment.",

      "body": "<p>Every second Friday, before the evening Shabbat service, Reform rabbi Jonathan Romain holds an instruction class for converts. Most attend because they are marrying Jewish partners, but some come for a different reason. Disillusioned with other faiths, they hope Judaism is the answer to their religious quest. </p> <p>Numbers of such people are tiny: a handful in Romain's class of 20 in his synagogue at Maidenhead, Berkshire, and just 27 in the entire liberal reform movement last year. But they show that even Judaism - which does not actively seek new adherents - is affected by a rising tide of conversions, among both major faiths and minor cults, in spite of dwindling attendance at many traditional places of worship. </p> <p>It is estimated that 1,000 people a day find a new religion. This is a complex pattern with every imaginable permutation. Some with no faith are finding a god or guru for the first time; others are switching one set of beliefs for another. Methodists becoming Moslems and Catholics becoming Jews is unusual; Jews choosing Buddhism is bizarre, but it is happening. And on the fringe, the choice is bewildering: it is estimated that some 400 cults have emerged since 1945. Romain knows about all these crosscurrents; how for some, religion is added to the pick and mix menu of their lifestyle choices. For as well as observing, and encouraging, interested non-Jews to convert, he has researched the wider trends for a new book, Your God Shall Be My God. </p> <p>Religion has become \"much more a matter of choice than of inherited tradition\", he says.

      "bodyText": "Every second Friday, before the evening Shabbat service, Reform rabbi Jonathan Romain holds an instruction class for converts. Most attend because they are marrying Jewish partners, but some come for a different reason. Disillusioned with other faiths, they hope Judaism is the answer to their religious quest. Numbers of such people are tiny: a handful in Romain's class of 20 in his synagogue at Maidenhead, Berkshire, and just 27 in the entire liberal reform movement last year. But they show that even Judaism - which does not actively seek new adherents - is affected by a rising tide of conversions, among both major faiths and minor cults, in spite of dwindling attendance at many traditional places of worship. It is estimated that 1,000 people a day find a new religion. This is a complex pattern with every imaginable permutation. Some with no faith are finding a god or guru for the first time; others are switching one set of beliefs for another. Methodists becoming Moslems and Catholics becoming Jews is unusual; Jews choosing Buddhism is bizarre, but it is happening. And on the fringe, the choice is bewildering: it is estimated that some 400 cults have emerged since 1945. Romain knows about all these crosscurrents; how for some, religion is added to the pick and mix menu of their lifestyle choices. For as well as observing, and encouraging, interested non-Jews to convert, he has researched the wider trends for a new book, Your God Shall Be My God. Religion has become \"much more a matter of choice than of inherited tradition\", he says. More of the young are deciding for themselves, rather than following their parents' beliefs. At the same time, it is becoming privatised. \"Religion was once a family affair - the family that prayed together stayed together, that sort of thing. Now it's very much a personal hobby.

For almost half a century, he was married to an English woman, and when I asked him once if she had not objected to his banging on about her race, he said, \"Amor vincit omnia.\" His son went to an English boarding school.</p> <p>He was in Who's Who, but, at one point, that would have told you more about the private lives of the old Soviet leaders. There was a name, \"THOMAS, Ronald Stuart\", followed by the reason for its inclusion - \"poet\" - but, after that, just a list of church livings and of books, also an address, for he was a vicar, after all. But there was no record of parents, marriage, fatherhood, not even a date of birth.</p> <p>In old age, he relented and supplied most of these, even throwing in his Queen's medal for poetry but, unlike the gardening, fishing, motoring princes of his church, never did add \"recreations\". There was only one, birdwatching, and this was there in the poems - just as everything else was there in the poems.</p> <p>It is the dilemma of the lyric poet that his material is his own life, his commodity intimacy. So Thomas Hardy, in old age, sent up a smokescreen against future biographers by guardedly writing an autobiography, which he then got his wife to publish after his death under her own name. RS Thomas wrote his in Welsh, and called it Neb - nobody.</p> <p>There was mischief in this, for the answers his admirers sought were in a language they could not understand. But it also reflected the bitterness which danced attendance on him as he grew old, that he had learnt his native language too late in life to write poetry in it. \"All those words, and me outside them.\"</p> <p>To adapt what someone said of de Gaulle, Thomas had one illusion, Wales, and one hate, the Welsh, who had been born into a tradition they neglected, and which he, like a tramp at Christmas, was doomed to stand outside. He said once that there had been no personal influences on his life, no guiding schoolmaster or tutor - and little contact later with anyone who could be considered his peer. He took no newspapers, entertained no friends. He was the loneliest man I ever met.</p> <p>It was partly the loneliness of the country priest, cut off by his cloth and learning, but a lot more was deliberate. He felt so cut off from the modern world, with its cult of personality, that, in the autobiography, he referred to himself throughout in the third person - as \"the boy\", \"RS\", \"the rector\" - as though watching himself, often with startled interest, from space. He could take this sense of distance to hair-raising lengths, as when, asked whether he felt lonely after the death of his wife, he said he sometimes felt lonely when she was alive. It is one thing to encounter bleak honesty in the poems, but quite another to encounter it in conversation.</p> <p>\"It was difficult to talk to Mr Thomas,\" a reporter wrote disgruntledly. \"He makes it almost obsessively clear that he does not suffer fools, or foolish things, easily.\"</p> <p>He would not have recognised the self-portrait of the autobiography, of a figure encased in innocence, who accommodated the ambitions and needs of others. Thomas's mother, a domineering and possessive woman, thought the priesthood a safe career; he became a priest. His wife wanted a child (\"the possibility of this had not entered his mind\") - and the child was, born, \"with his huge hunger,\" wrote the poet who could also start a poem, \"Dear parents/ I forgive you my life.\"</p> <p>He was a sea captain's son, read Latin at University College, Bangor, where he also played rugby - the forbid ding initials stemmed from the team lists, which contained more than one Thomas - was ordained, and married the painter Elsi Eldridge, then an art teacher at Oswestry high school. They had one son, Gwydion, a lecturer in education, who never learnt Welsh, unlike his father, who did so at the age of 30.</p> <p>The relationship between Thomas and his country was a strange one. It began and ended in Holyhead, so what lay between was an odyssey - from Chirk, his first curacy, on the border, to Manafon, a border parish, to another in mid-Wales, and to the last, at Aberdaron, at the western edge of Wales. This should have been a progres sion into the heart of Welshness, only it wasn't; there was much black comedy about the odyssey.</p> <p>Those who knew only the public figure of his later years, with his bitter pronoucements on English incomers - \"the cantankerous clergyman,\" \"the fiery poet-priest\" - would have been startled to meet him in his beginnings, the curate trudging dutifully towards his weekly lesson with a copy of Welsh Made Easy under his arm. But then, there was also comedy about the later years, when, in the Welsh heartland, he met English pensioners in their holiday homes (\"an Elsan culture/ Threatens us\"). It was this which produced the public figure, when the press picked up the chance remark that he could understand the motives of those who burnt down these cottages.</p> <p>There were many interviews then, and many photographs of a wild, gaunt face against the sky, or scowling over the half-door of the 16th-century cottage to which he had retired. Controversy surfaced again when he was nominated for the Nobel prize in his 82nd year, for it had been largely forgotten that this ogre was also the finest living lyric poet, ironically, in the English language.</p> <p>Acclaim came late. Thomas was 42 when Rupert Hart-Davis brought out Song At The Year's Turning, before which there had been just one book, printed at his own expense, and a few poems in magazines. John Betjeman contributed a preface, in which he wrote, \"The name which has the honour to introduce this fine poet to a wider public will be forgotten long before that of RS Thomas.\"</p> <p>There were some generous reviews, Kingsley Amis calling him \"one of the best half-dozen poets now writing in English,\" and, by the time Selected Poems appeared 20 years later, an anonymous reviewer in the TLS was starting to use words like \"major poetry\". Suddenly, nobody was making the old charge, that Thomas was a \"limited\" poet.</p> <p>Yet it was easy to see why it had been made. He wrote about the hill farmers he had met in his first parish, a people and a way of life very few of his readers would have encountered. He wrote about religious faith, when, for many, this would have held only an historical interest. He attacked modern life, modern technology, the English encroaching into Wales and the Welsh responsible for the decay of their own culture and language.</p> <p>There is no comfort in any of these poems. \"Too far for you to see/ The fluke and the foot-rot and the fat maggot/ Gnawing the skin from the small bones./ The sheep are grazing at Bwlch-y-Fedwen,/ Arranged romantically in the usual manner/ On a bleak background of bald stone.\" The hill farmer, at one moment a cosmic symbol of endurance is also greedy, joyless, physically repugnant.</p> <p>There is no comfort in the religious poetry either, and no answers. One, called Earth, begins: \"What made us think/ It was yours? Because it was signed/ With your blood, God of battles?\" Yet there is a grim compassion for the hill farmer, and there is the odd abrupt burst of lyricism, when the poet is caught off-guard by the beauty of the natural world.</p> <p>But the tone is inevitably the bleak, ruthlessly honest note Thomas now made his own. There is also a hardness about his rhythms, and a clarity about his words and images (\"Who put the crease in your soul, Davies?\") that preserved him from the misanthropy and the ranting into which some of his attitudes could have betrayed him.</p> <p>Later, he added God to his dramatis personae, a cold figure indifferent to His creation, and there were small collections with titles like H'm, in which the main emotions seemed to be weariness and disgust. \"Just souring old age,\" said Thomas. \"My mother used to ask my father, 'Haven't you a good word to say about anybody?' He thought for a long time and said 'No'.\"</p> <p>But it was an industrious disgust, for he wrote on and on, and it was startling to be reminded of just how many small collections there had been when the Collected Poems appeared, a volume of 500 pages, of near-Victorian dimensions. In old age, the poems were increasingly abstract, God increasingly absent - though much addressed - so the bursts of lyricism were winter sunlight. This is on the death of his wife:</p> <p>We met</p> <p>under a shower</p> <p>of bird-notes.</p> <p>Fifty years passed</p> <p>love's moment</p> <p>in a world in</p> <p>servitude to time.</p> <p>She was young;</p> <p>I kissed with my eyes</p> <p>closed and opened</p> <p>them on her wrinkles.</p> <p>\"Come,\" said death,</p> <p>choosing her as his</p> <p>partner for</p> <p>the last dance. And she,</p> <p>who in life</p> <p>had done everything</p> <p>with a bird's grace,</p> <p>opened her bill now</p> <p>for the shedding</p> <p>of one sigh no</p> <p>heavier than a feather.</p> <p>I met him when I was 17. He suggested we have tea in a hotel on the seafront at Aberystwyth, but in summer there are many clerical collars in Aberystwyth. A fat man in specs passed, and I hoped it would not be him, then a cheerful chap with a pipe, and I hoped it would not be him either. But then a third man came, a tall, lean athletic man bent against the wind - and it was the face of the poems.</p> <p>When I wrote about it later, I used adjectives like \"hard\" and \"severe\", and had the phrase \"almost predatory\". By return of post came a letter from Thomas, in which he signed himself \"Nimrod\". That sense of humour, faint and dry, and so baffling to the young, was the strangest of all his contradictions.</p> <p>He is survived by his son and his second wife, Elisabeth Vernon.</p> <p>The Rev Ronald Stuart Thomas, priest and poet, born March 29 1913; died September 25 2000</p>",

There was a name, \"THOMAS, Ronald Stuart\", followed by the reason for its inclusion - \"poet\" - but, after that, just a list of church livings and of books, also an address, for he was a vicar, after all. But there was no record of parents, marriage, fatherhood, not even a date of birth. In old age, he relented and supplied most of these, even throwing in his Queen's medal for poetry but, unlike the gardening, fishing, motoring princes of his church, never did add \"recreations\". There was only one, birdwatching, and this was there in the poems - just as everything else was there in the poems. It is the dilemma of the lyric poet that his material is his own life, his commodity intimacy. So Thomas Hardy, in old age, sent up a smokescreen against future biographers by guardedly writing an autobiography, which he then got his wife to publish after his death under her own name. RS Thomas wrote his in Welsh, and called it Neb - nobody. There was mischief in this, for the answers his admirers sought were in a language they could not understand. But it also reflected the bitterness which danced attendance on him as he grew old, that he had learnt his native language too late in life to write poetry in it. \"All those words, and me outside them.\" To adapt what someone said of de Gaulle, Thomas had one illusion, Wales, and one hate, the Welsh, who had been born into a tradition they neglected, and which he, like a tramp at Christmas, was doomed to stand outside. He said once that there had been no personal influences on his life, no guiding schoolmaster or tutor - and little contact later with anyone who could be considered his peer. He took no newspapers, entertained no friends. He was the loneliest man I ever met. It was partly the loneliness of the country priest, cut off by his cloth and learning, but a lot more was deliberate. He felt so cut off from the modern world, with its cult of personality, that, in the autobiography, he referred to himself throughout in the third person - as \"the boy\", \"RS\", \"the rector\" - as though watching himself, often with startled interest, from space. He could take this sense of distance to hair-raising lengths, as when, asked whether he felt lonely after the death of his wife, he said he sometimes felt lonely when she was alive. It is one thing to encounter bleak honesty in the poems, but quite another to encounter it in conversation. \"It was difficult to talk to Mr Thomas,\" a reporter wrote disgruntledly. \"He makes it almost obsessively clear that he does not suffer fools, or foolish things, easily.\" He would not have recognised the self-portrait of the autobiography, of a figure encased in innocence, who accommodated the ambitions and needs of others. Thomas's mother, a domineering and possessive woman, thought the priesthood a safe career; he became a priest. His wife wanted a child (\"the possibility of this had not entered his mind\") - and the child was, born, \"with his huge hunger,\" wrote the poet who could also start a poem, \"Dear parents/ I forgive you my life.\" He was a sea captain's son, read Latin at University College, Bangor, where he also played rugby - the forbid ding initials stemmed from the team lists, which contained more than one Thomas - was ordained, and married the painter Elsi Eldridge, then an art teacher at Oswestry high school. They had one son, Gwydion, a lecturer in education, who never learnt Welsh, unlike his father, who did so at the age of 30. The relationship between Thomas and his country was a strange one. It began and ended in Holyhead, so what lay between was an odyssey - from Chirk, his first curacy, on the border, to Manafon, a border parish, to another in mid-Wales, and to the last, at Aberdaron, at the western edge of Wales. This should have been a progres sion into the heart of Welshness, only it wasn't; there was much black comedy about the odyssey. Those who knew only the public figure of his later years, with his bitter pronoucements on English incomers - \"the cantankerous clergyman,\" \"the fiery poet-priest\" - would have been startled to meet him in his beginnings, the curate trudging dutifully towards his weekly lesson with a copy of Welsh Made Easy under his arm. But then, there was also comedy about the later years, when, in the Welsh heartland, he met English pensioners in their holiday homes (\"an Elsan culture/ Threatens us\"). It was this which produced the public figure, when the press picked up the chance remark that he could understand the motives of those who burnt down these cottages. There were many interviews then, and many photographs of a wild, gaunt face against the sky, or scowling over the half-door of the 16th-century cottage to which he had retired. Controversy surfaced again when he was nominated for the Nobel prize in his 82nd year, for it had been largely forgotten that this ogre was also the finest living lyric poet, ironically, in the English language. Acclaim came late. Thomas was 42 when Rupert Hart-Davis brought out Song At The Year's Turning, before which there had been just one book, printed at his own expense, and a few poems in magazines. John Betjeman contributed a preface, in which he wrote, \"The name which has the honour to introduce this fine poet to a wider public will be forgotten long before that of RS Thomas.\" There were some generous reviews, Kingsley Amis calling him \"one of the best half-dozen poets now writing in English,\" and, by the time Selected Poems appeared 20 years later, an anonymous reviewer in the TLS was starting to use words like \"major poetry\". Suddenly, nobody was making the old charge, that Thomas was a \"limited\" poet. Yet it was easy to see why it had been made. He wrote about the hill farmers he had met in his first parish, a people and a way of life very few of his readers would have encountered. He wrote about religious faith, when, for many, this would have held only an historical interest. He attacked modern life, modern technology, the English encroaching into Wales and the Welsh responsible for the decay of their own culture and language. There is no comfort in any of these poems. \"Too far for you to see/ The fluke and the foot-rot and the fat maggot/ Gnawing the skin from the small bones./ The sheep are grazing at Bwlch-y-Fedwen,/ Arranged romantically in the usual manner/ On a bleak background of bald stone.\" The hill farmer, at one moment a cosmic symbol of endurance is also greedy, joyless, physically repugnant. There is no comfort in the religious poetry either, and no answers. One, called Earth, begins: \"What made us think/ It was yours? Because it was signed/ With your blood, God of battles?\" Yet there is a grim compassion for the hill farmer, and there is the odd abrupt burst of lyricism, when the poet is caught off-guard by the beauty of the natural world. But the tone is inevitably the bleak, ruthlessly honest note Thomas now made his own. There is also a hardness about his rhythms, and a clarity about his words and images (\"Who put the crease in your soul, Davies?\") that preserved him from the misanthropy and the ranting into which some of his attitudes could have betrayed him. Later, he added God to his dramatis personae, a cold figure indifferent to His creation, and there were small collections with titles like H'm, in which the main emotions seemed to be weariness and disgust. \"Just souring old age,\" said Thomas. \"My mother used to ask my father, 'Haven't you a good word to say about anybody?' He thought for a long time and said 'No'.\" But it was an industrious disgust, for he wrote on and on, and it was startling to be reminded of just how many small collections there had been when the Collected Poems appeared, a volume of 500 pages, of near-Victorian dimensions. In old age, the poems were increasingly abstract, God increasingly absent - though much addressed - so the bursts of lyricism were winter sunlight. This is on the death of his wife: We met under a shower of bird-notes. Fifty years passed love's moment in a world in servitude to time. She was young; I kissed with my eyes closed and opened them on her wrinkles. \"Come,\" said death, choosing her as his partner for the last dance. And she, who in life had done everything with a bird's grace, opened her bill now for the shedding of one sigh no heavier than a feather. I met him when I was 17. He suggested we have tea in a hotel on the seafront at Aberystwyth, but in summer there are many clerical collars in Aberystwyth. A fat man in specs passed, and I hoped it would not be him, then a cheerful chap with a pipe, and I hoped it would not be him either. But then a third man came, a tall, lean athletic man bent against the wind - and it was the face of the poems. When I wrote about it later, I used adjectives like \"hard\" and \"severe\", and had the phrase \"almost predatory\". By return of post came a letter from Thomas, in which he signed himself \"Nimrod\". That sense of humour, faint and dry, and so baffling to the young, was the strangest of all his contradictions. He is survived by his son and his second wife, Elisabeth Vernon. The Rev Ronald Stuart Thomas, priest and poet, born March 29 1913; died September 25 2000",
