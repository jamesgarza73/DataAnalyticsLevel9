If you don't like organised activities and overbearing reps, you will be relieved to find that the Laskarina reps are on call but keep a low profile. </p> <p>Some of the bigger travel companies go to the same places, but with Laskarina you can chat on the phone to the sales reps for ages, the brochure has a warts-and-all pitch, and the pricing is clear - there's no rooting around in the small print for surcharges. </p> <p>Best of all is the accommodation. Having booked my holiday to Leros at the last minute, I had a certain trepidation, as my choice had been somewhat limited. But the apartment - set in a hillside, castle-like folly with beautiful gardens - was spacious and tastefully decorated in the traditional style. On Alonissos, it had been even better - a charmingly restored house in the old town, with a corner-style Greek fireplace and antique furniture. </p> <p>Whether you plump for a classical villa, traditional house or one of the more quirky options, you're likely to have a fantastic view because Laskarina is big on balconies. </p> <p>Transportation to your property is arranged, usually by taxi. You are warned in advance that you might have to carry your luggage to your door if your accommodation is not roadside. But it is likely to be a short distance. In fact, the only real difficulty with Laskarina is settling on which island to go to next time.

Some of the bigger travel companies go to the same places, but with Laskarina you can chat on the phone to the sales reps for ages, the brochure has a warts-and-all pitch, and the pricing is clear - there's no rooting around in the small print for surcharges. Best of all is the accommodation. Having booked my holiday to Leros at the last minute, I had a certain trepidation, as my choice had been somewhat limited. But the apartment - set in a hillside, castle-like folly with beautiful gardens - was spacious and tastefully decorated in the traditional style. On Alonissos, it had been even better - a charmingly restored house in the old town, with a corner-style Greek fireplace and antique furniture. Whether you plump for a classical villa, traditional house or one of the more quirky options, you're likely to have a fantastic view because Laskarina is big on balconies. Transportation to your property is arranged, usually by taxi. You are warned in advance that you might have to carry your luggage to your door if your accommodation is not roadside. But it is likely to be a short distance. In fact, the only real difficulty with Laskarina is settling on which island to go to next time. See you on Symi?

      "body": "<p>The Ancient Greeks had some fine ideas about leisure. It was Aristotle who insisted on the psychic importance of setting aside time to pursue arete and eudaimonia - cultivation and happiness. Unfortunately, this was contingent upon the existence of slaves to wrestle with the dreary details of daily existence, but nobody's perfect. </p> <p>By the middle of last summer, my best friend Sophie and I had had our naturally glass-half-full dispositions sorely tested by a catalogue of unlucky and unsolicited happenings. August bowled in with neither the promise of a change in the weather nor in our fortunes, All Saints were in the charts with the single Pure Shores, and their insistent \"Take me to the be-ee-each\" resonated in our eardrums. And so, in need of leisure, in need of time, we found ourselves on a rickety bus, thighs sweat-sealed to the hot plastic seats, heading for Emborios, the northern-most village of the Greek island of Kalymnos. </p> <p>Presented with two family-free twentysomethings, the airport rep furrowed her brow when we walked off the plane on the neighbouring island of Kos.\"There's not much to do there, girls,\" she said fretfully. But that, of course, was precisely the point. </p> <p>As we scooted past the steak-and-chops caf\u00e9s and cramped beaches of the tourist haven of Kos, we smiled benignly. On the open top deck of the ferry to Pothia, the Kalymnian port capital, the warm wind whipped around us like a cobweb cleaner. And when the bus finally deposited us on the dusty beachside track at Emborios, we knew the good life had arrived. </p> <p>Too often these days, holidays become a competition - the wierdest, the furthest, the most dangerous, the most culturally enriching. As we work longer hours in increasingly insecure scenarios, \"I don't have time\" has become both a necessary mantra and a cultural identifier. Our contract terms may be unstable, but our lack of minutes provides us with the sense of importance we crave. And consequently, with leisure time, if we allow ourselves any at all, we are embarrassed by any form of relaxation that is not stifled by activity, that is not proving its and our, worth. As depression rates rise like steam, we become proportionately less versed in the simple pleasures of life. Yet we ache to stretch out on the sand in the sunshine. </p> <p>But Sophie and I had no such qualms. We'd earned our rest. As we hauled our bags along the pebbly upper shore towards our apartment, it was obvious that we had found Our Beach and, thankfully, one without a populous of experience-rich backpackers to bore us senseless. </p> <p>The George Apartments are named after their owner, a sharp-eyed barrel of a man who brings us peaches. The building contains six apartments in all, each with ample kitchen, wide balcony and cool tiling. Inside and out, they are painted that particular Mediterranean white that radiates sunshine during the day and, even in the pitch black of night, emits a blue glow that seems to hang in the air around the stone. </p> <p>The building hunches to the right of the dark sand beach, bounded by tamarisk trees. Our balcony looks across Arginondas bay to the islets of Telendos and Kalavros, which acquire a variety of hues from pink to purplish depending on the hour of the day and the angle of the sun. A volcanic island made up of three ridges, split by two fertile valleys, Kalymnos' northern range begins to our left. The mountains dip their toes in the sea. One looks like a skull in the early morning light. </p> <p>We make our way to the beach forthwith, but are waylaid by Bob from Portsmouth. He arrived a few days ago with his wife, the beatific Mrs Bob, to manage the apartments for George after selling up his newsagent's business back home. This is the beginning of their retirement plan. </p> <p>Bob didn't like the climate in England. \"I know,\" Sophie responds sympathetically, \"it's been a terrible summer.\" No, he replies stoutly, the social climate. We nod knowingly and shake out our beach towels. Every morning, George and Bob can be found sitting on the terrace, bonding in their shorts. George's chest is brown and forested with glossy dark hair. Bob's similar expanse is turning a ripe red. Mrs Bob, who prefers to stay out of the sun, makes tea. She shares with us her discovery that one of the local loaves can be sliced lengthways \"so it's just like toast\". </p> <p>And so the days develop a rhythm of their own: breakfast on the balcony, swimming and sunning through the day, an ouzo at sunset then a stroll in the musky evening air to one of the four or five tavernas dotted through the village. </p> <p>We buy huge bright tomatoes and sweet peaches from the fruit and veg van that drives through the village once a day. The local shop sells slabs of tart feta and olive oil in dusty bottles. And for dinner, we pick a fresh fish from the rack to have grilled with garlic and herbs. We commit only one culinary faux pas after brazenly ordering octopus, which I have to hide beneath my chips. Try as I might to get along with seafood in all its forms, I am consistently confounded by octopus. It is the rubbery flesh, and those unapologetic suckers that flummox me. </p> <p>But mostly, we talk. Our conversation ambles along tangents, up spiral staircases, and into cul-de-sacs in a way that would be impossible elsewhere. We explore thoughts to their logical, and sometimes illogical, conclusions: if it's possible to burn through the clouds, whether the large ants sting. Somehow, different subjects come to be discussed in different places: the balcony for politics, the beach for jokes, the dinner table for sexual and family matters, the sea for secrets. One time, during sea-talk, I tell Sophie a nugget that makes her shriek for the rest of the day. This place is heavenly. </p> <p>Our rep is called Susan. She is kind to us once she realises that we are making our own fun, and are not desperate for directions to the nearest disco. Her company, Direct Greece, caters for genuine Greek-o-philes, she tells us. We feel suitably privileged. </p> <p> K alymnos is one of the 18 islands, also including Kos and Rhodes, that make up the Dodecanese, the furthest Greek island group from the mainland. Beading the throat of the west coast of Turkey, these islands have had a turbulent history, enduring centuries of occupation by Crusaders, Ottomans and Italians, and were only finally included in the modern Greek state in 1948. </p> <p>Most of the population of Kalymnos lives in or around Pothia. Built into the southern valley, the back streets wind and duck, offering a maze of brightly-coloured Italianate houses. After the discreet peace of Emborios, the ice cream and artefacts of Pothia jar a little, but the harbour is worth exploring as well as the nearby thermal baths and sea caves. </p> <p>Pothia's wealth is a legacy of the sponge industry, now all but extinct after disease devastated almost all of the Med's sponge beds. Most of the remaining sponge boats have now been customised for deep-sea fishing and, although the warehouses behind Pothia harbour still process and sell sponges all year round, the majority are imported from Asia and America. </p> <p>Susan says that the way to tell whether a sponge is good is to dunk it in water, squeeze it fiercely and see whether it retains its original shape. Sophie and I enjoy a sloppy half hour in the sponge museum testing our purchases, which we promptly forget to give to their intendeds on return to London. </p> <p>Back in Emborios, where everyone is now known to us by the name of the taverna they frequent, Captain Costa points out the old sponge diver's suit that hangs in the middle of the restaurant. The sponge boat owners were like mill owners, we are told: capitalists who sent down village men in new-fangled diving suits with no training in how to use them. One of Costa's relatives was forced to dive immediately after his brother had surfaced too quickly and died in front of him. Avoidance of nitrogen embolism - \"the bends\" - was basic: freshly surfaced divers were required to smoke a cigarette; if they were able to inhale satisfactorily, they were deemed well, if not they were thrown back into the sea and ordered to come up more slowly. </p> <p>Emborios is not yet saturated with tourist dwellings, and the local people maintain a healthy ambivalence towards any expectation that they should adopt the mantle of seasonal service personnel. Visitors are welcomed rather than commodified. It's harmonious, and it probably won't last beyond another couple of summers. </p> <p>One night, we walk up the scarred hillside behind the village to Pablo's taverna, which affords a magnificent view of the bay. The owner has recently moved back to Kalymnos from Melbourne. There was an exodus to Australia in the 1950s, she tells us, as the islands bore the brunt of post-war poverty, exacerbated by the decline of the sponge trade. \"But life here challenges me more,\" she explains. </p> <p>Evidence of the diaspora is all around. The final night of our stay sees the festival of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, a day when, traditionally, people return to their home villages. Emborious swells accordingly, and the night before the coast road was a ribbon of car head-lights as families headed for the nearest church service. </p> <p>On our last night, George cooks a huge barbecue. His kids play stadium rock tapes and air-guitar like they mean it. We are presented with a photograph of the apartments, and told to bring our friends next year. But if we do, will it be Our Beach anymore? </p> <p><strong> The practicals</strong><br> </p> <p> Direct Greece (0870 5168683) offers a wide range of packages to Kalymnos.

      "body": "<p>Apart from the name, what really set me against twitching as a hobby was the thought of standing all day in a field with a bush on my head and only seeing a magpie for my troubles. All that effort and embarrassment for what exactly? Call me cynical, but it never seemed to offer the casual enthusiast proper guarantees of reward because you can never ensure that the birds will agree to the deal. No, what I needed to really share the passion was to find a place where the birds packed the skies with their presence, demanding to be noticed, and where I didn't need to wear a puff-sleeved anorak. </p> <p>So it is with a degree of triumph and embarrassment that I can report that this unlikely synthesis was achieved while lounging in a hot tub, gin and tonic in hand, on the top deck of a cruise ship somewhere in the Pacific. We were still several miles off the Galapagos Islands and yet there they were, a dozen strange-winged creatures soaring and swooping in silhouette against the early-morning sky. As a taster of one of the most unsullied bird havens in the world, it was remarkable; and I began to understand what all the fuss is about. This was Luxury Twitching, and it has a charm all of its own. </p> <p>To see this sight, it took Charles Darwin, with whom the archipelago will always be associated, four years on The Beagle, frequent bouts of sea-sickness and endless disputes with a quarrelsome captain. It took me a couple of days out of London, a form of evolution for which I am eternally grateful. The islands are now a fully-accessible tourist destination, offering a five-star entry ticket into Birdville. </p> <p>A few more minutes and the skies were alive with crackling energy as blue-footed boobies dive-bombed for fish from 50 m, disappearing into the turquoise sea with pinpoint precision before emerging seconds later like underwater missiles bursting through the air. Once on land, an unofficial greeting party of mocking birds, curious and welcoming, hopped and skipped among us while multi-coloured finches hovered over the burnt-brown bushes. </p> <p>Darwin, who identified 13 different types of finch on the islands, is never far away from the thoughts of modern visitors, who in a weird way recreate their own updated version of The Origin of Species. These are the most highly-developed tourists around, completely unafraid to set foot on their new surroundings and beautifully adapted to the rigours of luxury travel. Within minutes of stretching out on the bleached white sand of San Cristobal, we resembled the big barrels of blubbery sea lions who sprawl around the place like they own it. </p> <p>Each year, around 60,000 people travel to the islands, drawn by their mix of isolation and abundant wildlife. Situated 600 miles west of Ecuador, they have become one of the most tightly controlled tourist zones in the world, and the talk is of cutting numbers rather than increasing them, an interesting reversal of every known travel trend. </p> <p>For understandable conservation reasons, independent travel is frowned upon so tourists are bundled up on boats and carefully shepherded around the 13 islands which are strung out over 60,000 square miles of the Pacific. Although settlement has never been encouraged, the larger islands are now inhabited in a reasonably unobtrusive sort of way. The smaller ones, no more than strands of volcanic rock jutting out of the water, have been left to the wildlife. There is nothing else to see, but it is enough. Imagine going on safari by cruise ship and you'll get the general idea. Companies offer three-, four- or seven-day island-hopping trips which, if booked via British operators, are combined with further time spent on the mainland. </p> <p>Almost everyone onboard is transformed into a wildlife enthusiast, thumbing through guidebooks as if they are pot-boiler novels. There is no escaping this process because almost every species on the islands demands attention. I found myself arriving with a headful of thoughts and leaving with a headful of knowledge, dumbstruck by the details of everyday bird life. </p> <p>While the onboard regime tends towards the militaristic with early-morning wake-ups, group check-ins and lectures of variable quality, you are offered a reasonable degree of freedom to mooch around on shore. However, failure to stick to the routes, marked out with black-and-white posts, does not go down well with the guides, who regard it as an offence akin to seal-culling. </p> <p>The age-span on our ship ranged from seven to 65, although this kind of holiday tends to attract more elderly tourists. Hikes on shore are gentle affairs, with little climbing and much meandering. Groups tend to be limited to 20-30 at a time, which felt about right, with three-hour trips on land morning and afternoon. They are interspersed with copious amounts of food - good rather than excellent - onboard, where downtime was spent relaxing rather than partying. </p> <p>Each island has its own charm and distinctive wildlife variations. My favourite was Tower, a horseshoe-shaped outcrop to the north of the chain. It is a fantastically bleak place, built from jet-black boulders and covered with sparse vegetation. In summer, the many-tentacled incense trees perfume the air with the richest aroma. Here, red-footed boobies with bright-blue beaks cling to the trees like bolt-on extras and albatrosses circle overhead in a scene straight out of Hitchcock. These birds are not tame, but as they have no predators as adults they harbour no fear, inspecting intruders with regal disdain. </p> <p>Equally lofty are the marine iguanas, which are unique to the islands. Originally land reptiles, they evolved over a couple of million years into creatures able to stay underwater for up to an hour. Scour the sea and you will spot them bobbing up and down like pieces of darkest driftwood waiting to be tossed on to the rocks for a breather. On land, they spit the salt from their nostrils while perching unnoticed on the rocks, moving their exquisitely webbed feet with tiny steady-as-you-go steps. </p> <p>For history, Floreana has the edge, largely because of its reputation as a lost paradise. A group of Europeans, including a disciple of Nietzsche and a sex-mad baroness with three lovers, made this their home in the 1930s, becoming a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre when murder and shipwreck destroyed their tiny colony. The inhabited islands hold other bizarre tales of humanity's misguided attempts to settle, including a spectacularly unsuccessful foray by a group of 2,000 Norwegians who turned up thinking this was the new Tahiti. Floreana also boasted one of the most brutal penal colonies known to man. All in all, you get the sense that this really is a place best left to the boobies. </p> <p>Just to the north is Santa Cruz, an inhabited island where the giant tortoises roam. You'd think it would be easy to spot such a ponderous mover, but they tend to lurk behind dense vegetation and are not easily spotted in the wild. We saw three in the Highlands above Puerto Ayora, a long drive for limited reward. An alternative is to view them on the island's Darwin Center, where they are bred in captivity and come in all shapes and sizes. </p> <p>Tortoises hatch their eggs in April, but there is never a right or wrong time to visit the islands because the shifting seasons bring their own rewards. The busiest months are December and January, when you will also spot whales swimming alongside the ship. While the islands are lusher at the start of the year, temperatures can reach 40C and many prefer to travel, as I did, after the rainy season ends in June. One guidebook plumped for November as the ideal visiting time, neither too hot nor cold, with a minimum of tourists. Certainly one attraction of going later in the year is the number of baby sea lions and birds, all learning the rudiments of island life. </p> <p>There is something truly astonishing about sea lions. One minute they are gliding through the water with complete aplomb and the next they are lumbering around on land looking like they've had some vital part lopped off.

      "bodyText": "Apart from the name, what really set me against twitching as a hobby was the thought of standing all day in a field with a bush on my head and only seeing a magpie for my troubles. All that effort and embarrassment for what exactly? Call me cynical, but it never seemed to offer the casual enthusiast proper guarantees of reward because you can never ensure that the birds will agree to the deal. No, what I needed to really share the passion was to find a place where the birds packed the skies with their presence, demanding to be noticed, and where I didn't need to wear a puff-sleeved anorak. So it is with a degree of triumph and embarrassment that I can report that this unlikely synthesis was achieved while lounging in a hot tub, gin and tonic in hand, on the top deck of a cruise ship somewhere in the Pacific. We were still several miles off the Galapagos Islands and yet there they were, a dozen strange-winged creatures soaring and swooping in silhouette against the early-morning sky. As a taster of one of the most unsullied bird havens in the world, it was remarkable; and I began to understand what all the fuss is about. This was Luxury Twitching, and it has a charm all of its own. To see this sight, it took Charles Darwin, with whom the archipelago will always be associated, four years on The Beagle, frequent bouts of sea-sickness and endless disputes with a quarrelsome captain. It took me a couple of days out of London, a form of evolution for which I am eternally grateful. The islands are now a fully-accessible tourist destination, offering a five-star entry ticket into Birdville. A few more minutes and the skies were alive with crackling energy as blue-footed boobies dive-bombed for fish from 50 m, disappearing into the turquoise sea with pinpoint precision before emerging seconds later like underwater missiles bursting through the air. Once on land, an unofficial greeting party of mocking birds, curious and welcoming, hopped and skipped among us while multi-coloured finches hovered over the burnt-brown bushes. Darwin, who identified 13 different types of finch on the islands, is never far away from the thoughts of modern visitors, who in a weird way recreate their own updated version of The Origin of Species. These are the most highly-developed tourists around, completely unafraid to set foot on their new surroundings and beautifully adapted to the rigours of luxury travel. Within minutes of stretching out on the bleached white sand of San Cristobal, we resembled the big barrels of blubbery sea lions who sprawl around the place like they own it. Each year, around 60,000 people travel to the islands, drawn by their mix of isolation and abundant wildlife. Situated 600 miles west of Ecuador, they have become one of the most tightly controlled tourist zones in the world, and the talk is of cutting numbers rather than increasing them, an interesting reversal of every known travel trend. For understandable conservation reasons, independent travel is frowned upon so tourists are bundled up on boats and carefully shepherded around the 13 islands which are strung out over 60,000 square miles of the Pacific. Although settlement has never been encouraged, the larger islands are now inhabited in a reasonably unobtrusive sort of way. The smaller ones, no more than strands of volcanic rock jutting out of the water, have been left to the wildlife. There is nothing else to see, but it is enough. Imagine going on safari by cruise ship and you'll get the general idea. Companies offer three-, four- or seven-day island-hopping trips which, if booked via British operators, are combined with further time spent on the mainland. Almost everyone onboard is transformed into a wildlife enthusiast, thumbing through guidebooks as if they are pot-boiler novels. There is no escaping this process because almost every species on the islands demands attention. I found myself arriving with a headful of thoughts and leaving with a headful of knowledge, dumbstruck by the details of everyday bird life. While the onboard regime tends towards the militaristic with early-morning wake-ups, group check-ins and lectures of variable quality, you are offered a reasonable degree of freedom to mooch around on shore. However, failure to stick to the routes, marked out with black-and-white posts, does not go down well with the guides, who regard it as an offence akin to seal-culling. The age-span on our ship ranged from seven to 65, although this kind of holiday tends to attract more elderly tourists. Hikes on shore are gentle affairs, with little climbing and much meandering. Groups tend to be limited to 20-30 at a time, which felt about right, with three-hour trips on land morning and afternoon. They are interspersed with copious amounts of food - good rather than excellent - onboard, where downtime was spent relaxing rather than partying. Each island has its own charm and distinctive wildlife variations. My favourite was Tower, a horseshoe-shaped outcrop to the north of the chain. It is a fantastically bleak place, built from jet-black boulders and covered with sparse vegetation. In summer, the many-tentacled incense trees perfume the air with the richest aroma. Here, red-footed boobies with bright-blue beaks cling to the trees like bolt-on extras and albatrosses circle overhead in a scene straight out of Hitchcock. These birds are not tame, but as they have no predators as adults they harbour no fear, inspecting intruders with regal disdain. Equally lofty are the marine iguanas, which are unique to the islands. Originally land reptiles, they evolved over a couple of million years into creatures able to stay underwater for up to an hour. Scour the sea and you will spot them bobbing up and down like pieces of darkest driftwood waiting to be tossed on to the rocks for a breather. On land, they spit the salt from their nostrils while perching unnoticed on the rocks, moving their exquisitely webbed feet with tiny steady-as-you-go steps. For history, Floreana has the edge, largely because of its reputation as a lost paradise. A group of Europeans, including a disciple of Nietzsche and a sex-mad baroness with three lovers, made this their home in the 1930s, becoming a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre when murder and shipwreck destroyed their tiny colony. The inhabited islands hold other bizarre tales of humanity's misguided attempts to settle, including a spectacularly unsuccessful foray by a group of 2,000 Norwegians who turned up thinking this was the new Tahiti. Floreana also boasted one of the most brutal penal colonies known to man. All in all, you get the sense that this really is a place best left to the boobies. Just to the north is Santa Cruz, an inhabited island where the giant tortoises roam. You'd think it would be easy to spot such a ponderous mover, but they tend to lurk behind dense vegetation and are not easily spotted in the wild. We saw three in the Highlands above Puerto Ayora, a long drive for limited reward. An alternative is to view them on the island's Darwin Center, where they are bred in captivity and come in all shapes and sizes. Tortoises hatch their eggs in April, but there is never a right or wrong time to visit the islands because the shifting seasons bring their own rewards. The busiest months are December and January, when you will also spot whales swimming alongside the ship. While the islands are lusher at the start of the year, temperatures can reach 40C and many prefer to travel, as I did, after the rainy season ends in June. One guidebook plumped for November as the ideal visiting time, neither too hot nor cold, with a minimum of tourists. Certainly one attraction of going later in the year is the number of baby sea lions and birds, all learning the rudiments of island life. There is something truly astonishing about sea lions. One minute they are gliding through the water with complete aplomb and the next they are lumbering around on land looking like they've had some vital part lopped off. Most of the day is spent lolling, an art they have refined to perfection. They are the animal equivalent of the idle rich, but for me the undoubted stars of the islands. Darwin required the best part of 15 years to fully evaluate what he had seen here, and it is hard to think of anywhere likely to leave a more indelible impression on the modern traveller.

      "body": "<p>Most big tour operators include Greece in their programmes, and last-minute cheap packages are widely available to Rhodes, Kos, Crete, Skiathos, Zakinthos and Corfu, and often to Halkidiki and Tolon on the mainland. If you're after a basic beach holiday, the price of a package is often no more than the cost of a flight. </p> <p>But if you are looking for something more remote, unspoilt or geared to a particular interest, it's best to book through the smaller, specialist agencies or go backpacking - island-hopping is one of the easiest, most pleasurable and cost-effective methods of exploring (see page 10). A good source of updated information is <a href=\"http://www.greekislandhopping.com\">www.greekislandhopping.com</a> , which has ferry schedules, passes and links to other Hellenic sites. </p> <p> Greece has almost 1,500 islands, 160 of them inhabited, and only a handful have suffered from excessive tourist developments. </p> <p>Starting in the north, Skopelos has a fertile green landscape and pretty flower-filled hill towns. </p> <p>In the Dodecanese, Ikaria offers thick pine forest, tranquil lakes and empty beaches. Neighbouring Samos is more visited but has an impressive 160km of coastline plus a mountainous, rugged interior popular with walkers. </p> <p>Over in the northern Aegean, one of the quietest islands with direct flights from the mainland is Limnos. This butterfly-shaped, agricultural island offers 250km of unspoilt coastline and hosts surprisingly few tourists due to its infrequent ferry services. </p> <p>But for something truly tranquil, head further west to the Ionian for a painting holiday on the island of Corfu where, away from the obvious tourist areas, there are deep green valleys, olive groves and tall cypress trees making a perfect backdrop. Classes are hosted by Wendy Jelbert, a professional artist, teacher and member of both the Society of Acrylic Painters and The Society of Women Artists. The medium is watercolour and classes cater to all levels. </p> <p> Travel \u00e0 la Carte (01635 863030) has seven nights' self-catering at Liakada Cottage, Skopelos, from \u00a3409pp, including return flights and ferry transfers. Ikaria and Samos are new programme additions for Sunvil Holidays (020-8568 4499) with a week's holiday costing from \u00a3358pp, including flights, ferry transfers and self-catering accommodation. Sunvil Holidays (020-8568 4499) offers a seven-night stay at the self-catering Afrodite Apartments, Limnos, priced from \u00a3386pp, including flights and transfers. Greek Islands Club (020-8232 9780, <a href=\"http://www.greekislandsclub.com\">www.greekislandsclub.com</a> ) has a painting holidays on Corfu from \u00a3641pp (one week) and \u00a3898pp (two weeks) including return flights, transfers, half-board accommodation at the Villa de Loulia, excursions and painting tuition. </p> <p> Pack an enormous reserve of energy and head straight for the Cyclades. A requirement of entry on to the tiny, pulsating lump of rock called Ios appears to be the desire to drink your bodyweight in island moonshine, and to lose your passport/tickets/dignity within 24 hours of hitting the ramshackle port. You can't fly direct, and the island's clientele are mostly young backpackers, with so many of them originating from Ireland that Ios is sometimes said to be an acronym for Ireland Over Seas. Visitors seem either to stay for an entire season or leave on the next boat. </p> <p>The queen of the Cyclades however, is Mykonos. Although 800,000 tourists pass through the island each year (and if you've been in August you'll be convinced they're all there at the same time), it retains a sophisticated party atmosphere, rarely cheap though always cheerful. Ibiza and Sitges may have superseded it as gay Meccas of the Med, but Mykonos still has a thriving scene, and with its immaculate whitewashed houses and picture-perfect windmills, the main town is as beautiful as any in the Aegean. </p> <p>Further south and shifting down a gear or two in pace (at least outside peak summer months) is Santorini. It was a sophisticated outpost of the Minoan civilisation until an enormous volcanic explosion in 1,550BC ripped the island apart. The sultry black-sand beaches and sulphur-clouded hot-springs are a constant reminder. Here hedonism comes in the shape of gold and silver: the jewellery shops in the main town, Thira, are enough to make you wish for 10 more fingers and multiple piercings. </p> <p> easyJet (0870 6000 000, www. easyJet.com) flies Luton to Athens from \u00a3140 return. A direct bus from Athens airport goes to the port of Piraeus, from where you can board a daily ferry to Ios. Gay specialist Man Around (020-8902 7177, <a href=\"http://www.manaround.com\">www.manaround.com</a>) has B&amp;B packages from \u00a3326pp for a seven-night break at the three-star Carrop Tree Hotel, Mykonos, including flights. First Choice (0870 7500001) offers a week's self-catering at the Marillia Village, Santorini, from \u00a3324pp, including return flights and transfers. </p> <p> Ferry services to the far-flung islands are often infrequent, so it's easiest to travel in peak season. Tilos, halfway between Rhodes and Kos, at first appears barren - arid mountains and sheer cliffs swooping down to the sea - but becomes seductively fertile as you go inland. Valleys full of fruit trees and flowers make great terrain for walkers. </p> <p>Leros is gentler and greener than its nearest neighbour, Kalymnos, with uncrowded beaches and coves and bustling, non-tourist-dependent towns. </p> <p>Without an airport or an inter-island ferry connection, Samothraki attracts few visitors, but the dark, imposing mass of granite has some good beaches and classical remains. </p> <p>In the Dodecanese, Patmos is 12 miles across and has a population of 2,500. With no airport (it's reached by one-hour hydrofoil crossing from Samos) and a host of pretty beaches, Patmos is also one of Greece's most upmarket islands, dominated by an imposing fortified monastery where St John the Divine wrote the Book of Revelations. </p> <p>Over in the Ionian, Ithaca's proximity to Corfu and the increasingly popular Cephalonia (Captain Corelli's island) would suggest a similar degree of mainstream tourist development; this is not the case. Odysseus' legendary homeland, one hour by ferry from Kefalonia, still retains sparsely populated beaches (albeit pebbly coves rather than sand) and peaceful fishing villages . </p> <p> Laskarina Holidays (01629 822 203 <a href=\"http://www.laskarina.co.uk\">www.laskarina.co.uk</a>) has two weeks' self-catering accommodation on Tilos or Leros, from \u00a3400pp, including return flights and transfers. Filoxenia (01422 371796, <a href=\"http://www.filoxenia.co.uk)\">www.filoxenia.co.uk)</a> has two weeks' B&amp;B on Samothraki for \u00a3650pp, including return flights to Kavala, four hours away by ferry. Sunvil Holidays (020-8568 4499) has one-week holidays on Patmos and Ithaca from \u00a3450pp, including return flights, all land and boat transfers and B&amp;B hotel accommodation. </p> <p> Greece's spectacular Easter celebrations are equalled only by Spain's Semana Santa. On Good Friday, expect effigy-burning processions followed by the breaking of the fast at the stroke of midnight on Saturday with dazzling candle-lit mass, firecrackers and feasting. Veggies should note that this is a meat-focused festival; a lamb on a spit is at the rotating centre of any party. </p> <p> The mainland has impressive celebrations in the pretty Peloponnese town of Nafplio, and the celebrations in Crete are most likely to be accompanied by good weather. </p> <p> Filoxenia (01422 371796, www. filoxenia.co.uk) has two weeks' self-catering at the Villa Lilly just outside Nafplio, from \u00a3440pp, including return flights; and two weeks' half-board at the Hotel Istron Bay in eastern Crete from \u00a3440pp, including return flights. </p> <p> Some of the best walking in Europe is to be found in the Pindos mountains, an area of semi-nomadic shepherds, stone hamlets and wild, rocky national parkland. Walking is mainly on old mule tracks passing richly-decorated churches, monasteries and some 6,000 species of flowers including 100 types of orchid. </p> <p>And on the southern-most tip of the Peloponnese, the Mani peninsula is pretty much unchanged since Homer described it, an arid Mediterranean weather-beaten \"gateway to the underworld\". </p> <p> Naturetrek (01962 733051, www. naturetrek.co.uk) has a 15-day tour of the Pindos mountains, departing June 4, for \u00a3995pp, including return flights, hotel accommodation with most meals (the walking is mostly moderate with some more strenuous optional excursions). Headwater (01606 813333, <a href=\"http://www.headwater\">www.headwater</a> .com) has an eight-day guided walking tour of the Mani from \u00a3827pp, including return flights and hotel accommodation with most meals (5-6 hours of moderate level walking each day). </p> <p> Athens is the best place to start a tour of Greece's antiquities. Within half an hour of leaving the airport, you can be at the Parthenon overlooking the terracotta roofs of the 19th-century city (the rabbit-warren streets of Plaka). </p> <p>Easily accessible from Athens are Epidaurus, with its spectacular restored theatre, the Bronze-Age fortress of Tiryns and the extensive ruins of Mycenae, Argos, the oracle at Delphi, and Olympia, birthplace of the Games. </p> <p> British Museum Traveller (020-7436 7575, <a href=\"http://www.britishmuseumtraveller.co.uk\">www.britishmuseumtraveller.co.uk</a>) offers the Classical Greece Tour, departing May 5, taking in Athens and the Peloponnese, from \u00a32,350pp, including the services of a lecturer, return flights, transfers, transport, accommodation with most meals, and all the site entrance fees. </p> <p> Flotilla holidays, which involve a group of yachts loosely following the same route, are an excellent way to feel independent while retaining sociable and safe contact with other craft. Yachts come in all sizes and cater to all levels - unskippered or fully crewed. In the Ionian, you can take in popular islands such as Zakinthos and Cephalonia, along with deserted craggy coves along the mainland shore and less visited islands such as the charming and undeveloped Kythira off the southern tip of the Peloponnese. </p> <p>An alternative to flotillas for the more tentative sailor are club-based holidays where a variety of water sports and craft can be tried out on a daily basis. </p> <p> Neilson (0870 9099099, www. neilson.com) operates flotilla holidays, based around the Ionian and Peloponnese, from \u00a3705pp for two weeks including return flights, transfers, accommodation, instruction and insurance. Sunsail (02392 222222, <a href=\"http://www.sunsail.com\">www.sunsail.com)</a> offers two weeks at the secluded Club Leda, on the Pelion peninsula (eastern mainland) from \u00a3695pp including half-board accommodation, return flights, transfers and free use of all equipment (catamarans, yachts, windsurfers, dinghies etc). Mark Warner (08708 480480) offers sailing at its clubs on Kos, Lemnos and in Paleros on the mainland. Prices per person for seven nights, including sailing, windsurfing,waterskiing, watersports tuition, tennis, aerobics, kids clubs (2-17yrs), full board with wine, and flights, start at \u00a3455 for Lakitira, \u00a3545 for Paleros and \u00a3584 for Lemnos. </p> <p> Hallowed stomping ground for chic new-age types, the Skyros Centre on Skyros offers alternative R&amp;R for those that want \"sun, sea and a sense of community\". Courses include creative writing, sailing, singing, dance, reiki, massage and yoga. </p> <p>Further south, in Crete, you can take a holistic holiday at a renovated 17th-century olive mill. Based in the bay of Kissamos, the West Crete Holidays centre is run by an English couple who offer courses in everything from yoga and belly dancing, to bird watching and the Alexander technique. </p> <p> The Skyros Centre (020-7267 4424) offers two-week holidays (including up to six courses) from \u00a3625pp with full-board accommodation but not flights. West Crete Holidays (0114 244 6273) has one-week holidays from \u00a3300pp, including full-board accommodation, transfers but not flights. </p> <p> According to Rosemary Barron (author of Flavours of Greece), real Greek cuisine remains very much undiscovered. Her one- week cookery course in Santorini aims to teach guests about the wine, history and food lore of Greece, and to conjure up dishes from such seductive ingredients as the miniature tomatoes that take their concentrated flavour from Santorini's volcanic soil. Along with syrup-soaked deserts, you will learn to make local specialities such as bay-leaf-scented chicken with figs and the most famous Santorini dish fava , which takes its name from a yellow-gold lentil grown throughout the island. Classes generally take place in the morning with sightseeing excursions in the afternoon. </p> <p>Further east on the quiet Dodecanese island of Symi, you can learn to make Greek treats with local chef Stavros Gogios. For one week this spring, Stavros will be turning his attentions to teaching British travellers, rather than serving them, with a new Greek cookery course. Spend four hours each morning learning to turn locally- grown produce (from the neighbouring organic farm) and freshly-harvested fish and mountain herbs into such specialities as seafood filo pastry parcels and lamb cooked with honey and rosemary. Long lunches at Stavros's Mythos restaurant, located on Symi's steep harbour, follow morning classes, which leaves the afternoons free for walking off the excess, climbing the island's endless, steep stone steps. </p> <p> Tasting Places (020-7460 0077, <a href=\"http://www.tastingplaces.com\">www.tastingplaces.com</a>) has one-week courses with Rosemary Barron from \u00a31,070pp including full-board pension accommodation, tuition and excursions. Flights extra. Laskarina Holidays (01629 822203) offers a one-week cookery course, departing April 18, including, lunch, self-catering accommodation,and flights from \u00a3565pp.</p>",

With no airport (it's reached by one-hour hydrofoil crossing from Samos) and a host of pretty beaches, Patmos is also one of Greece's most upmarket islands, dominated by an imposing fortified monastery where St John the Divine wrote the Book of Revelations. Over in the Ionian, Ithaca's proximity to Corfu and the increasingly popular Cephalonia (Captain Corelli's island) would suggest a similar degree of mainstream tourist development; this is not the case. Odysseus' legendary homeland, one hour by ferry from Kefalonia, still retains sparsely populated beaches (albeit pebbly coves rather than sand) and peaceful fishing villages . Laskarina Holidays (01629 822 203 www.laskarina.co.uk) has two weeks' self-catering accommodation on Tilos or Leros, from \u00a3400pp, including return flights and transfers. Filoxenia (01422 371796, www.filoxenia.co.uk) has two weeks' B&amp;B on Samothraki for \u00a3650pp, including return flights to Kavala, four hours away by ferry. Sunvil Holidays (020-8568 4499) has one-week holidays on Patmos and Ithaca from \u00a3450pp, including return flights, all land and boat transfers and B&amp;B hotel accommodation. Greece's spectacular Easter celebrations are equalled only by Spain's Semana Santa. On Good Friday, expect effigy-burning processions followed by the breaking of the fast at the stroke of midnight on Saturday with dazzling candle-lit mass, firecrackers and feasting. Veggies should note that this is a meat-focused festival; a lamb on a spit is at the rotating centre of any party. The mainland has impressive celebrations in the pretty Peloponnese town of Nafplio, and the celebrations in Crete are most likely to be accompanied by good weather. Filoxenia (01422 371796, www. filoxenia.co.uk) has two weeks' self-catering at the Villa Lilly just outside Nafplio, from \u00a3440pp, including return flights; and two weeks' half-board at the Hotel Istron Bay in eastern Crete from \u00a3440pp, including return flights. Some of the best walking in Europe is to be found in the Pindos mountains, an area of semi-nomadic shepherds, stone hamlets and wild, rocky national parkland. Walking is mainly on old mule tracks passing richly-decorated churches, monasteries and some 6,000 species of flowers including 100 types of orchid. And on the southern-most tip of the Peloponnese, the Mani peninsula is pretty much unchanged since Homer described it, an arid Mediterranean weather-beaten \"gateway to the underworld\". Naturetrek (01962 733051, www. naturetrek.co.uk) has a 15-day tour of the Pindos mountains, departing June 4, for \u00a3995pp, including return flights, hotel accommodation with most meals (the walking is mostly moderate with some more strenuous optional excursions). Headwater (01606 813333, www.headwater .com) has an eight-day guided walking tour of the Mani from \u00a3827pp, including return flights and hotel accommodation with most meals (5-6 hours of moderate level walking each day). Athens is the best place to start a tour of Greece's antiquities. Within half an hour of leaving the airport, you can be at the Parthenon overlooking the terracotta roofs of the 19th-century city (the rabbit-warren streets of Plaka). Easily accessible from Athens are Epidaurus, with its spectacular restored theatre, the Bronze-Age fortress of Tiryns and the extensive ruins of Mycenae, Argos, the oracle at Delphi, and Olympia, birthplace of the Games. British Museum Traveller (020-7436 7575, www.britishmuseumtraveller.co.uk) offers the Classical Greece Tour, departing May 5, taking in Athens and the Peloponnese, from \u00a32,350pp, including the services of a lecturer, return flights, transfers, transport, accommodation with most meals, and all the site entrance fees. Flotilla holidays, which involve a group of yachts loosely following the same route, are an excellent way to feel independent while retaining sociable and safe contact with other craft. Yachts come in all sizes and cater to all levels - unskippered or fully crewed. In the Ionian, you can take in popular islands such as Zakinthos and Cephalonia, along with deserted craggy coves along the mainland shore and less visited islands such as the charming and undeveloped Kythira off the southern tip of the Peloponnese. An alternative to flotillas for the more tentative sailor are club-based holidays where a variety of water sports and craft can be tried out on a daily basis. Neilson (0870 9099099, www. neilson.com) operates flotilla holidays, based around the Ionian and Peloponnese, from \u00a3705pp for two weeks including return flights, transfers, accommodation, instruction and insurance. Sunsail (02392 222222, www.sunsail.com) offers two weeks at the secluded Club Leda, on the Pelion peninsula (eastern mainland) from \u00a3695pp including half-board accommodation, return flights, transfers and free use of all equipment (catamarans, yachts, windsurfers, dinghies etc). Mark Warner (08708 480480) offers sailing at its clubs on Kos, Lemnos and in Paleros on the mainland. Prices per person for seven nights, including sailing, windsurfing,waterskiing, watersports tuition, tennis, aerobics, kids clubs (2-17yrs), full board with wine, and flights, start at \u00a3455 for Lakitira, \u00a3545 for Paleros and \u00a3584 for Lemnos. Hallowed stomping ground for chic new-age types, the Skyros Centre on Skyros offers alternative R&amp;R for those that want \"sun, sea and a sense of community\". Courses include creative writing, sailing, singing, dance, reiki, massage and yoga. Further south, in Crete, you can take a holistic holiday at a renovated 17th-century olive mill. Based in the bay of Kissamos, the West Crete Holidays centre is run by an English couple who offer courses in everything from yoga and belly dancing, to bird watching and the Alexander technique. The Skyros Centre (020-7267 4424) offers two-week holidays (including up to six courses) from \u00a3625pp with full-board accommodation but not flights. West Crete Holidays (0114 244 6273) has one-week holidays from \u00a3300pp, including full-board accommodation, transfers but not flights. According to Rosemary Barron (author of Flavours of Greece), real Greek cuisine remains very much undiscovered. Her one- week cookery course in Santorini aims to teach guests about the wine, history and food lore of Greece, and to conjure up dishes from such seductive ingredients as the miniature tomatoes that take their concentrated flavour from Santorini's volcanic soil. Along with syrup-soaked deserts, you will learn to make local specialities such as bay-leaf-scented chicken with figs and the most famous Santorini dish fava , which takes its name from a yellow-gold lentil grown throughout the island. Classes generally take place in the morning with sightseeing excursions in the afternoon. Further east on the quiet Dodecanese island of Symi, you can learn to make Greek treats with local chef Stavros Gogios. For one week this spring, Stavros will be turning his attentions to teaching British travellers, rather than serving them, with a new Greek cookery course. Spend four hours each morning learning to turn locally- grown produce (from the neighbouring organic farm) and freshly-harvested fish and mountain herbs into such specialities as seafood filo pastry parcels and lamb cooked with honey and rosemary. Long lunches at Stavros's Mythos restaurant, located on Symi's steep harbour, follow morning classes, which leaves the afternoons free for walking off the excess, climbing the island's endless, steep stone steps. Tasting Places (020-7460 0077, www.tastingplaces.com) has one-week courses with Rosemary Barron from \u00a31,070pp including full-board pension accommodation, tuition and excursions. Flights extra. Laskarina Holidays (01629 822203) offers a one-week cookery course, departing April 18, including, lunch, self-catering accommodation,and flights from \u00a3565pp.",

      "body": "<p>No responsible ski instructor will allow any novice out on to the main slopes until they show that they can turn and stop under control. The quickest and easiest way to gain that control is the \"snowplough\" position. (In North America, this is referred to as the \"wedge\" position.) </p> <p>In the <strong> snowplough </strong> , the ski tips should be kept close together (about an inch or two apart), whereas the tails should be much wider apart. The foot position should be fairly wide, which naturally puts both skis on to their inside edges. It is the friction of those inside edges against the snow that will control the skier's speed. </p> <p>But this is not a static, stable position; it is a dynamic equilibrium. If the skier relaxes, the skis will naturally start to come together into parallel alignment. To maintain the snowplough position, you need to keep pushing your heels apart. Gradually, you can learn to control the width of your snowplough and hence your speed. The wider the angle of the skis, the slower you will go; the narrower, the quicker you will go. </p> <p>The snowplough position is also the basis for the first turns that most novice skiers will learn to make: <strong> snowplough turns </strong> . The key principle is that the outside ski controls the turn. So, if you want to turn left, you need to apply pressure to the right ski, and vice versa. This tenet of putting most of your weight on to your outside ski is one that remains crucial, up through all levels of skiing ability. </p> <p>There is a simple way for snowploughers to get their weight over the outside ski during the turn. They can learn how to bend their body sideways, so that their shoulders lean out over the outside foot. This sideways bending is called \"angulation\", and is an invaluable habit for all skiers to learn. Some ski schools, though, teach a more modern method, recommending that the shoulders are kept level. </p> <p>A common problem for first-timers with the snowplough turn is getting the ski tips crossed. This can be remedied by pushing the inside ski forward during the turn, so that it remains slightly ahead of the outside ski. </p> <p>After a couple of days, most beginners will be happily making snowplough turns all over the mountain, on the flatter runs, and many will be ready to take the next step: learning the <strong> traverse </strong> position. This is the first time that they will be skiing, at least for short periods, with their skis in a parallel alignment. </p> <p>The traverse is a funda- mental stance, used by all skiers when skiing across a slope, in between turns. It is crucial that you learn a correct traverse position from day one, as faults will get much harder to rectify later on. The body angles used in traversing are so basic, that it could be said that all parallel skiing can be defined as a series of traverses. </p> <p>When traversing, the uphill ski should be slightly ahead of the downhill ski. This will dictate the correct angle for the whole of the rest of the body: the uphill knee, hip, shoulder and hand should all be slightly ahead of their downhill counterparts. The shoulders should be leaning out, to keep the body weight over the downhill ski. The knees and hips should be pushed towards the uphill side. This helps tilt the skis on to their uphill edges, enabling them to hold an edge and preventing skidding. Viewed from directly ahead, the body should have a curved shape. </p> <p>Sounds easy in theory, but when inexperienced skiers get on to steeper slopes, they get nervous. Their instincts tell them to shy away from the drop below them with their shoulders, and lean instead towards the uphill side. This eradicates that curved body shape, causing the skis to flatten, and skid out of control. This is probably the single most frequent mistake made by intermediate skiers. Becoming a better skier entails overcoming your instincts, and teaching your body to always apply a good traverse position, even on the steepest slopes. </p> <p>Once you're able to consistently make snowplough turns, linking them with the traverse position, you'll be encouraged by your instructor to start \"matching your skis earlier in the turn\". In other words, you will continue to use a narrow snowplough to start each turn. But, during the turn, you will bring the inside ski around so that it is lined up parallel to the outside ski. The remainder of the turn is done with the skis parallel. This type of turn is known as a <strong> stem turn </strong> , and is achieved by the majority of people before the end of their first week on skis. The next step, which can prove tricky, is to eliminate the stem completely, and progress to parallel turns. </p> <p>Next week: learning parallel turns.

This tenet of putting most of your weight on to your outside ski is one that remains crucial, up through all levels of skiing ability. There is a simple way for snowploughers to get their weight over the outside ski during the turn. They can learn how to bend their body sideways, so that their shoulders lean out over the outside foot. This sideways bending is called \"angulation\", and is an invaluable habit for all skiers to learn. Some ski schools, though, teach a more modern method, recommending that the shoulders are kept level. A common problem for first-timers with the snowplough turn is getting the ski tips crossed. This can be remedied by pushing the inside ski forward during the turn, so that it remains slightly ahead of the outside ski. After a couple of days, most beginners will be happily making snowplough turns all over the mountain, on the flatter runs, and many will be ready to take the next step: learning the traverse position. This is the first time that they will be skiing, at least for short periods, with their skis in a parallel alignment. The traverse is a funda- mental stance, used by all skiers when skiing across a slope, in between turns. It is crucial that you learn a correct traverse position from day one, as faults will get much harder to rectify later on. The body angles used in traversing are so basic, that it could be said that all parallel skiing can be defined as a series of traverses. When traversing, the uphill ski should be slightly ahead of the downhill ski. This will dictate the correct angle for the whole of the rest of the body: the uphill knee, hip, shoulder and hand should all be slightly ahead of their downhill counterparts. The shoulders should be leaning out, to keep the body weight over the downhill ski. The knees and hips should be pushed towards the uphill side. This helps tilt the skis on to their uphill edges, enabling them to hold an edge and preventing skidding. Viewed from directly ahead, the body should have a curved shape. Sounds easy in theory, but when inexperienced skiers get on to steeper slopes, they get nervous. Their instincts tell them to shy away from the drop below them with their shoulders, and lean instead towards the uphill side. This eradicates that curved body shape, causing the skis to flatten, and skid out of control. This is probably the single most frequent mistake made by intermediate skiers. Becoming a better skier entails overcoming your instincts, and teaching your body to always apply a good traverse position, even on the steepest slopes. Once you're able to consistently make snowplough turns, linking them with the traverse position, you'll be encouraged by your instructor to start \"matching your skis earlier in the turn\". In other words, you will continue to use a narrow snowplough to start each turn. But, during the turn, you will bring the inside ski around so that it is lined up parallel to the outside ski. The remainder of the turn is done with the skis parallel. This type of turn is known as a stem turn , and is achieved by the majority of people before the end of their first week on skis. The next step, which can prove tricky, is to eliminate the stem completely, and progress to parallel turns. Next week: learning parallel turns.

We were in La Belle Helene (tel/fax: 0030 0751 76179), a modest pension in Mycenae, a mile or so from the ancient site where Agamemnon, Clytemnestra and Orestes are reputed to have lived and agonised, and which was unearthed by Dr Heinrich Schliemann in 1876. </p> <p>Nothing much has changed at La Belle Helene since the good doctor lodged there - probably not his pretty art-nouveau but board-hard bed and certainly not the plumbing (communal loos and showers down the corridor). But, wonder of wonders, the great names from the past remain, in the shape of Achilles Dassis and his son, Agamemnon, the latest in the line of tavern-keepers from the same family who have run the little hotel for the past 150 years. </p> <p>One cannot say it was the best hotel we stayed in during our fortnight's unguided tour of the Peloponnese, the \"plane leaf\" as it looks on the map, extending south from Athens. This is where all the great dramas of Greek mythology were played out, and it has retained its beauty and mystery, due in part to the travel industry's preoccupation with the islands. </p> <p>The latter-day Achilles is quite a character and not keen on coach parties. He has been known to turn them away, preferring to lavish attention on individual travellers. </p> <p>In July and August the buses descend on Mycenae, Mystra, Olympia and Epidaurus in their hundreds, their arrival anticipated by the taverna owners whose first job each morning is to lay out as many tables and chairs as possible outside their establishments. Thankfully, by the time we arrived in September there was no problem finding a place for lunch. </p> <p>Ancient Mycenae, built on a steep mountainside, is a breathtaking sight. Those who want to reach the summit and the palace - where Clytemnestra must have stood and watched for the bonfires signalling Agamemnon's return - are advised to drive to the upper entrance to climb the citadel. Those who are hearty of lung and stout of leg should make it in about an hour from the main entrance. Clytemnestra's tomb, with its narrow walls and beehive shape, lies between the main entrance and the distinctive 13th-century Lion's Gate, but you will have to ask your way, as there is no signpost to it. </p> <p>With a fast new road from Corinth, Mycenae makes a handy first stop on a tour of the Peloponnese. If you fly in to Athens, take the old road from the capital to Corinth, which is a welcome alternative to the E94 motorway that is choked with frantically-driven trucks. The old coast road winds picturesquely along the Megara gulf and, if the timing fits on the way out or back, there is a delightful, quiet, cheap hotel - the Hotel50 (0296 62250), so-called because it's exactly 50km from both Athens and Corinth - perched over the bay at Kineta, with balconies overlooking the sea. </p> <p>You can descend by a staircase to the beach and take your first swim, too, but you will need something on your feet, as like most (but not all) Peloponnese beaches, it is stony and rocky. </p> <p>From Mycenae, we headed for the Mani, via Sparti, a pleasant enough town with good accommodation in the shape of the Sparta Inn (0731 21021/3 fax: 24855). The hotel has two swimming pools - one on the roof - and was pleasingly cheap: Dr12,000(\u00a321.80) for a double room, balcony and bath, including a good breakfast. </p> <p>Sparti has a few relics of the brutal city state, but nearby Mystra, the most complete Byzantine town anywhere, is the real reason for going there. Beautifully restored, it offers a true step back into the past. </p> <p>But the tour buses, ever pushing onwards to pack in as many famous sights as possible, miss an absolute jewel, a mile down the road.

Spectacular in its location and construction, it is a haven of beauty in a wild landscape. </p> <p>So to the Mani, the middle peninsula of the three pointing south from mainland Greece, which is reputed to have the brightest light and the widest variety of herbs in Europe. We stumbled on a wonderful central point to rest, a few miles north in Alevra's Tower (0733 59388 - when closed, call Athens (01) 6645023).

On one side students pay tuition fees, the teaching profession is in crisis, and many of the frail and elderly must pay to help meet the costs of their care. On the other there are no tuition fees, teachers have won a 21.5% pay deal, and now it looks as though all pensioners will enjoy free long-term care.</p> <p>Scottish executive proposals to fund long-term care for all pensioners has opened up the biggest policy divide yet between Holyrood and Westminster, and raised the spectre of a two-tier UK society split along the Scotland-England border.</p> <p>Yesterday, as pressure grew on the UK government to follow Scotland's lead, there were warnings that Labour risked losing the grey vote over the issue, and predictions that Scotland could become a giant nursing home as pensioners rushed north to take advantage of any better deal.</p> <p>Sir Stewart Sutherland, who chaired the royal commission which recommended free personal care for the elderly, said he believed its introduction in England and Wales was now inevitable. But the health minister, John Hutton, ruled out any policy reversal in England and Wales, where nursing care is free but personal care is means-tested.</p> <p>\"Devolution means that it is for the Scottish parliament to make decisions on its response to the royal commission on long-term care,\" he said. \"Both the government and the Scottish executive are committed to improving health and social care services for older people, but we are doing this in different ways.\"</p> <p>Analysts say the government and the public have to accept that Scotland can follow a different path, however awkward it might prove. \"This is exactly what the Scottish parliament was designed to do,\" said Malcolm Dickson, professor of politics at Strathclyde University. \"It was designed to take decisions that reflected the broadest strand of public opinion.</p> <p>\"But it is an embarrassment for Labour in the run-up to a general election and following on from tuition fees and the teachers' deal. What the Scottish parliament has done is provide a stick with which to beat the party. People will say if it's good for Scotland why is it not good for the rest of the UK? But this is something the political parties need to get used to in a post-devolution situation.\"</p> <p>Downing Street may have been spared some difficulty by the fact that the Scottish executive will not reveal the detail of its proposals or take a final decision until August.</p> <p>Yesterday, the Scottish National party and the Conservatives demanded clarification of the executive's apparent commitment on free long-term care, but the first minister Henry McLeish would not comment further.

      "bodyText": "Devolution is drawing an indelible line across the UK. On one side students pay tuition fees, the teaching profession is in crisis, and many of the frail and elderly must pay to help meet the costs of their care. On the other there are no tuition fees, teachers have won a 21.5% pay deal, and now it looks as though all pensioners will enjoy free long-term care. Scottish executive proposals to fund long-term care for all pensioners has opened up the biggest policy divide yet between Holyrood and Westminster, and raised the spectre of a two-tier UK society split along the Scotland-England border. Yesterday, as pressure grew on the UK government to follow Scotland's lead, there were warnings that Labour risked losing the grey vote over the issue, and predictions that Scotland could become a giant nursing home as pensioners rushed north to take advantage of any better deal. Sir Stewart Sutherland, who chaired the royal commission which recommended free personal care for the elderly, said he believed its introduction in England and Wales was now inevitable. But the health minister, John Hutton, ruled out any policy reversal in England and Wales, where nursing care is free but personal care is means-tested. \"Devolution means that it is for the Scottish parliament to make decisions on its response to the royal commission on long-term care,\" he said. \"Both the government and the Scottish executive are committed to improving health and social care services for older people, but we are doing this in different ways.\" Analysts say the government and the public have to accept that Scotland can follow a different path, however awkward it might prove. \"This is exactly what the Scottish parliament was designed to do,\" said Malcolm Dickson, professor of politics at Strathclyde University. \"It was designed to take decisions that reflected the broadest strand of public opinion. \"But it is an embarrassment for Labour in the run-up to a general election and following on from tuition fees and the teachers' deal. What the Scottish parliament has done is provide a stick with which to beat the party. People will say if it's good for Scotland why is it not good for the rest of the UK? But this is something the political parties need to get used to in a post-devolution situation.\" Downing Street may have been spared some difficulty by the fact that the Scottish executive will not reveal the detail of its proposals or take a final decision until August. Yesterday, the Scottish National party and the Conservatives demanded clarification of the executive's apparent commitment on free long-term care, but the first minister Henry McLeish would not comment further. However, the Liberal Democrats, whose rebellion forced Mr McLeish to rethink his earlier refusal to fund all long-term care, said the executive's position was unequivocal. Enormous impact Public policy experts say this will have an enormous social impact across the UK. \"This is absolutely huge,\" said Allyson Pollock, chair of the school of public policy at University College London. \"It is really a triumph for Scotland if they really do go down this road. Over the last 20 to 30 years a lot of care has been shifted to being a personal responsilbity and what the Scottish parliament is saying is that care is now a universal collective responsiblity.\" Professor Pollok said the issue would shine a light on the \"covert privatisation\" of the health service in England and Wales. \"You have to ask why in England we are shunting more and more care into the unregulated private sector,\" she said. Teachers leaders have already warned that a recent 21.5% three-year pay deal for Scottish teachers will cause deep discontent south of the border. Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers, has said schools in England could find it even harder to attract teachers. \"I think morale of teachers in England and Wales will be severely depressed if they do not get at least equal treatment.\" Pensioners' groups in England have also warned that there will be great anger and bitterness if Scotland's elderly get a substantially better deal, but warnings that Scotland wll be colonised by middle class English pensioners have been dismissed. John Curtice, a political analyst at Strathlclyde University, whose elderly mother lives in Cornwall, said: \"At the point which people need that kind of care the last thing they are going to be capable of doing is making a long-distance, long-term move.\" Others say the biggest question raised by the care issue is how Scotland can afford to be so generous. The country has traditionally enjoyed a favourable slice of public funds in its \u00a317bn budget, some 25% higher per head than the rest of the UK. Some analysts say the care issue will increase pressure for a complete review of funding, but economist Arthur Midwinter says Scotland has an appropriate share for its level of need and can afford the \u00a3110m cost of universal free care. \"If it's a priority they can find the money,\" he said. \"I don't see any difficulty in funding it.

She retreats, allowing the pampered guest to shower in a marble-clad bathroom, slip into a monogrammed bath robe and slippers, and emerge from the en-suite bathroom to the kitchen/dining room, which, at this end of the market, comes with en-suite chef. All chalets operated by Ski Scott Dunn come with a staff of two. </p> <p>Come the afternoon, the dining table sags under the weight of homemade lemon cake and chocolate biscuits, steaming pots of oolong and Java, fresh baguettes and several varieties of confitures. Appetite temporarily sated, there's just time to assume the horizontal on one of three enormous sofas and ferret around in the video library for something to fall asleep in front of before being woken for canapes. </p> <p>Having polished them off, it's eyes down for four courses of the finest modern British grub, washed down with a bottle or three of wine, before you crawl from the table, waistband straining, feeling like a minor European royal. And nothing to look forward to in the morning except some of the finest skiing in Europe. </p> <p>Such plush living is far from the norm in Val d'Is\u00e8re. Not that the town is shabby. Tucked away at the head of the Tarentaise valley, a spectacular three-and-a-half-hour crawl from Geneva on precipitous mountain roads, Val d'Is\u00e8re was subject to a substantial makeover in 1986. The concrete aberrations of the 60s were swept away and replaced with a timber- and stone-fronted town centre more befitting the ideal of an Alpine retreat. But the town is more famous for its sporting heritage. People come here to ski. The legendary Jean-Claude Killy, winner of three gold medals at the 1968 Winter Olympics, was raised here; and, to this day, children in the town are imbued with the sporting ethos, getting afternoons off school to hurl themselves down some of the most challenging and enjoyable slopes in the Alps. </p> <p>To an impeccable history can be added the sheer scale and variety of the skiing. Combined with Tignes, which sits in the next valley, the \u00e9space Killy , as it is known, stretches for some 300km, offering testing fare for intermediate skiers and some of the sport's more famous challenges to the more accomplished. These include the spectacular Face de Bellevarde, fashioned for the 1992 Winter Olympics men's downhill, which plummets around 1,100m to the village. </p> <p>The apr\u00e8s ski is, by reputation at least, no less formidable. Dick's Tea Bar was and is the original Alpine \"nightpub\", designed with the unique demands of the British winter tourist (late licence, well-stocked bar, dance floor on which to stagger until dawn) in mind. Other pubs, bars and restaurants abound, offering enough watering holes to slake the combined thirsts of the Grenadier Guards, the Irish Guards and the Oxford and Cambridge ski club, all of whom are regular early-season visitors. They take their partying seriously here. </p> <p>Away from the luxury, lodgings on the whole fall into the functional class. Affordable, practical and at last properly regulated and inspected, the apartments and chalets cater for those who want to spend the bulk of their trip on the piste in every sense, as opposed to on the sofa. </p> <p><strong> The practicals</strong><br> </p> <p> Ski Scott Dunn (020-8767 0202) operates chalets in Courcheval 1850, M\u00e9ribel, Zermatt, Champary as well as Val d'Is\u00e8re. Prices start at \u00a3475pp per week, rising to \u00a31,470, and include return flights from London to Geneva or Lyon, transfers, and breakfast and dinner six days a week. Child care is available in all resorts on request. A personal nanny for a week costs \u00a3265, with an \u00a385 supplement for each additional child, and cr che facilities cost between \u00a3140-\u00a3225 per child depending on age. Additional charges may be made for private transfers and some large bedrooms.</p> <p><strong> Getting the best out of Val d'Is\u00e8re</strong><br></p> <p><strong> Ski schools</strong> </p> <p> Val d'Is\u00e8re's ski area is vast. Combined with Tignes, the \u00e9space Killy covers 300km of runs, and for this reason alone a guide is a good idea. As well as improving your skiing, they'll help you get the most out of the bewildering choice, speed you through lift queues and secure a decent table for lunch. </p> <p> <strong> Top Ski </strong> (00 33 479 061 480) is run by the sage-like Pat Zimmer, a man with so many years on the slopes you fancy he can hear the mountain breathe. He specialises in off-piste trips. </p> <p> <strong> Mountain Masters</strong> (00 33 479 060 514) is made up of largely British guides who go by the book. They'll push as hard as you want and have a knack of instilling confidence. </p> <p> <strong> Snow Fun</strong> (00 33 479 06 19 79) is made up mostly of local boys, with some formerly very good young racers among them. Once again, local knowledge is invaluable and illuminating. </p> <p> <strong> Restaurants</strong> </p> <p> On the mountain, the restaurants, with the odd exception, are unspectacular and all of them charge Ffr2 (20p) to take a pee (taking the piss some call it, but it is free if you are eating) and the \"picnique interdit\" signs do detract a touch from the air of open-armed welcome you might desire. Self-service grub ranges from sandwiches to hot pots, with an omelette setting you back around Ffr55. Not cheap, but then they have to get the eggs up the hill. </p> <p>Best by far was <strong> La Fruiti\u00e8re</strong> (00 33 479 060 717), a former dairy. Plat du jour - a warming rabbit hot pot or lamb stew was typical - costs Ffr99, and with staff dressed in blue overalls, there's a functional, fashionable feel. Booking is essential in season. </p> <p>In the village, there was seldom reason to tear oneself away from the chalet, but <strong> Caf\u00e9 Jacques </strong> is a charm ing, open-all-hours family restaurant. The Ffr150 menu included duck cassoulet, a delicate slice of terrine, cheese and coffee. Add a modest Cte du Rhne and an armagnac and Ffr200 a head is realistic. </p> <p> <strong> Bars </strong></p> <p> <strong>Dick's Tea Bar</strong> heaves with Brits. Bar prices increase from Ffr16 for a beer before 9.30pm to a breathtaking Ffr32 after 11.30pm, when the door charge is Ffr70. Full of the sort of people you would try hard to avoid back home. </p> <p> <strong> Bananas</strong> is a cute operation in a former 60s chalet. Low key, with comfortable seating and a dozen backgammon tables upstairs; plus a snugger room downstairs which gets better as the evening goes on. </p> <p> <strong> Caf\u00e9 du Sports</strong> in the centre of town is mercifully old-school in approach. No daft cocktails, drinking games or DJ, just a fabulous array of spirits and liqueurs, some glorious sepia photographs of skiing's greats and a barman with whom, given time, you could establish a meaningful relationship. One day, you imagine, he might reach for your usual as soon as you walked through the door.</p>",

Mountain Masters (00 33 479 060 514) is made up of largely British guides who go by the book. They'll push as hard as you want and have a knack of instilling confidence. Snow Fun (00 33 479 06 19 79) is made up mostly of local boys, with some formerly very good young racers among them. Once again, local knowledge is invaluable and illuminating. Restaurants On the mountain, the restaurants, with the odd exception, are unspectacular and all of them charge Ffr2 (20p) to take a pee (taking the piss some call it, but it is free if you are eating) and the \"picnique interdit\" signs do detract a touch from the air of open-armed welcome you might desire. Self-service grub ranges from sandwiches to hot pots, with an omelette setting you back around Ffr55. Not cheap, but then they have to get the eggs up the hill. Best by far was La Fruiti\u00e8re (00 33 479 060 717), a former dairy. Plat du jour - a warming rabbit hot pot or lamb stew was typical - costs Ffr99, and with staff dressed in blue overalls, there's a functional, fashionable feel. Booking is essential in season. In the village, there was seldom reason to tear oneself away from the chalet, but Caf\u00e9 Jacques is a charm ing, open-all-hours family restaurant. The Ffr150 menu included duck cassoulet, a delicate slice of terrine, cheese and coffee. Add a modest Cte du Rhne and an armagnac and Ffr200 a head is realistic. Bars Dick's Tea Bar heaves with Brits. Bar prices increase from Ffr16 for a beer before 9.30pm to a breathtaking Ffr32 after 11.30pm, when the door charge is Ffr70. Full of the sort of people you would try hard to avoid back home. Bananas is a cute operation in a former 60s chalet. Low key, with comfortable seating and a dozen backgammon tables upstairs; plus a snugger room downstairs which gets better as the evening goes on. Caf\u00e9 du Sports in the centre of town is mercifully old-school in approach. No daft cocktails, drinking games or DJ, just a fabulous array of spirits and liqueurs, some glorious sepia photographs of skiing's greats and a barman with whom, given time, you could establish a meaningful relationship. One day, you imagine, he might reach for your usual as soon as you walked through the door.",

      "body": "<p>The northern Sporades lie just east of the Greek mainland, offspring of the same tectonic humping that spawned Mount Pilion, where the centaurs once roamed and the gods had their holiday home. Skiathos in the west, Skopelos in the centre, Alonissos in the east, they stand shoulder to shoulder in the northern Aegean like a trio of wading giants. They might be holding hands in the steel-blue depths. </p> <p>Around and between them flit lumpy roll-on roll-off ferries that would be at home in the English Channel; sleek hydrofoils that once plied the Volga; garishly-trimmed excursion ships; high-prowed fishing boats; streamlined yachts. Their wakes criss-cross the sea like turquoise ribbon. Greece has 1,425 islands, and what feels like 1,000 times as many boats. </p> <p>The Sporades have seen it all. Their pine-clad slopes have been conquered by Persians, Athenians, Cretans, Macedonians, Romans, Franks, Venetians, Turks and Germans. Between wars, their shores have been lashed by wave after wave of pirates, forcing the natives into fortified towns high above the sea. And now every spring and summer their bars and beaches are overrun by tens of thousands of tourists, together with mainland Greeks fleeing the heat. Increasing numbers are opting to \"island-hop\", flying in to the airport on Skiathos and then visiting the other islands by the network of ferries and hydrofoils. </p> <p>I was sitting in a bar in Skiathos Town, enjoying a cool Mythos beer after the flight in, when another Brit who knew the system came racing over. \"Quick! The ferry's coming in. Finish your drinks and get your luggage.\" A few gulps and we rushed down to the harbour, where a white-suited policeman fussed around as passengers piled off the hydrofoil. We picked up the bags we'd left on the quayside (no thieves outside high season, the locals insist), and within minutes we were bouncing over the waves. The ride was fast but bumpy, and the hydrofoils stop running when the seas are rough. Then - or if you're happy to take your time - you hop on a ferry. You'll get a better view, as well. </p> <p>First port of call was Skopelos, the largest of the three islands, though still under 100 sq km. Skopelos Town is an attractive overgrown village of whitewashed buildings with red roofs, with streets you climb as much as walk. Of course, you'll probably end up in one of the less picturesque apartment complexes on its borders. </p> <p>The island has some fine beaches, though you might want to avoid the oily-looking water around Skopelos Town itself. They're mostly pebble rather than sand, which keeps some travellers away but does its bit for the sunlounger industry. My first dip came at Panormos, a short taxi ride away on the far west side of the island, with a sharply shelving beach of silver stones and fantastically clear water. If you're used to swimming in the brown soup around Britain, you may worry about the dark shape following you in the depths of the water. It's not a shark - it's your shadow. And once you get used to it, swimming is one of the great pleasures of island-hopping. Take some goggles or a mask and have fun chasing the fishes. </p> <p>When you feel like a change, Panormos has a windsurfing school, as well as several large but friendly restaurants smack on the beach. The islands' staple diet is grilled squid or lamb chops and chips, with a side order of horiatiki , or \"Greek salad\". Simple food, cheap and well cooked. Within a few days you may find yourself craving pizza. </p> <p>Skopelos is best known for its churches: 120 in Skopelos Town itself, 300 in the island as a whole, for less than 5,000 locals. On a good day, you can have one to yourself. One morning, I walked the dusty road to the Monastery of the Metamorphosis, high in the hills to the east of Skopelos Town, where whitewashed walls encircle a cool, dark chapel tended by a grey-bearded monk. Outside, a weatherbeaten bench overlooks a valley lined with pine woods and olive groves, where goat bells clank and yellow and green butterflies flutter by. The sun blazed down, but a fig tree offered a little shade. Birds sang while I watched a stream of ants carrying fragments of grass and leaf back to their nest. Is there any finer holiday activity than watching someone else work? </p> <p>But the prettiest of the three islands is Alonissos, the least populated of the Sporades with a winter popula tion of just 1,500. It's also the least wooded, but the locals do their best to make up for that with potplants. Alonissos also boasts dozens of quiet sandy beaches, accessible only by boat or dirt track (the Sporades aren't big on roads). The main settlement is Patitiri, a rock-circled bay full of laid-back hotels and tavernas. When you get sick of stuffing your face among the bougainvillea, a bus or taxi will take you 2km up the hill to Old Alonissos. One fellow passenger pointed out: \"Sun every day in Greece; no sun in London.\" How very true. </p> <p>Old Alonissos is a 3D maze of steep, narrow alleys that suddenly open on to spectacular views. This was the island's capital until it was devastated by an earthquake in 1965. Greece's military rulers ordered its population rehoused in the port, but now the ruins have been bought up and renovated, mainly by foreigners who look down their noses at the \"ugly\" new town. </p> <p>Every second building in Old Alonissos is a smart bar or restaurant, and there are too many stalls selling Camden Market-style trinkets, but the place stays just the right side of airy-fairy. Perhaps it's the cats. Everywhere in the islands, mangy specimens beg for scraps while you eat, occasionally spitting at each other. At one maritime-themed bar in Old Alonissos, I was treated to a full-on fight, as two moggies chased each other under and over the tables until the owner finally had to push them away with his broom. </p> <p>Alonissos is the quietest of these islands, but the nightlife is there if you go looking for it. After dinner in Old Alonissos, I popped into one of Patitiri's disco-bars for a nightcap and somehow didn't get home till 6am. This put the mockers on a planned boat trip to the nearby monk seal colony, but a local confided that you're more likely to see a martian than one of these endangered animals. </p> <p>After Alonissos, Skiathos comes as a shock, with its crowds and the constant whine of scooters. The best-known of the Sporades, Skiathos balloons from 5,000 souls in winter to more than 50,000 in high season. The main settlement, Skiathos Town, is just minutes away from the airport, a mass of waterside bars and restaurants whose owners wave their wares at you and beckon you in. </p> <p>The island has just one metalled road, which runs along the south coast and serves countless sandy beaches separated by rocky headlands full of umbrella pines. At the western end of the island, Banana Beach is said to be the finest nudist stretch in the Mediterranean; further east, Kolios offers a gentle sweep of sand with a friendly watering hole, the Sand Bar Caf\u00e9. </p> <p>Cars, bicycles and scooters can all be rented in Skiathos Town; you'll need one of these to reach the ruins of the island's former capital, Castro, at the northernmost point of the island five or six hilly and dusty kilometres down a dirt track consisting entirely of hairpin bends full of suicidal Swedes on scooters.

      "bodyText": "The northern Sporades lie just east of the Greek mainland, offspring of the same tectonic humping that spawned Mount Pilion, where the centaurs once roamed and the gods had their holiday home. Skiathos in the west, Skopelos in the centre, Alonissos in the east, they stand shoulder to shoulder in the northern Aegean like a trio of wading giants. They might be holding hands in the steel-blue depths. Around and between them flit lumpy roll-on roll-off ferries that would be at home in the English Channel; sleek hydrofoils that once plied the Volga; garishly-trimmed excursion ships; high-prowed fishing boats; streamlined yachts. Their wakes criss-cross the sea like turquoise ribbon. Greece has 1,425 islands, and what feels like 1,000 times as many boats. The Sporades have seen it all. Their pine-clad slopes have been conquered by Persians, Athenians, Cretans, Macedonians, Romans, Franks, Venetians, Turks and Germans. Between wars, their shores have been lashed by wave after wave of pirates, forcing the natives into fortified towns high above the sea. And now every spring and summer their bars and beaches are overrun by tens of thousands of tourists, together with mainland Greeks fleeing the heat. Increasing numbers are opting to \"island-hop\", flying in to the airport on Skiathos and then visiting the other islands by the network of ferries and hydrofoils. I was sitting in a bar in Skiathos Town, enjoying a cool Mythos beer after the flight in, when another Brit who knew the system came racing over. \"Quick! The ferry's coming in. Finish your drinks and get your luggage.\" A few gulps and we rushed down to the harbour, where a white-suited policeman fussed around as passengers piled off the hydrofoil. We picked up the bags we'd left on the quayside (no thieves outside high season, the locals insist), and within minutes we were bouncing over the waves. The ride was fast but bumpy, and the hydrofoils stop running when the seas are rough. Then - or if you're happy to take your time - you hop on a ferry. You'll get a better view, as well. First port of call was Skopelos, the largest of the three islands, though still under 100 sq km. Skopelos Town is an attractive overgrown village of whitewashed buildings with red roofs, with streets you climb as much as walk. Of course, you'll probably end up in one of the less picturesque apartment complexes on its borders. The island has some fine beaches, though you might want to avoid the oily-looking water around Skopelos Town itself. They're mostly pebble rather than sand, which keeps some travellers away but does its bit for the sunlounger industry. My first dip came at Panormos, a short taxi ride away on the far west side of the island, with a sharply shelving beach of silver stones and fantastically clear water. If you're used to swimming in the brown soup around Britain, you may worry about the dark shape following you in the depths of the water. It's not a shark - it's your shadow. And once you get used to it, swimming is one of the great pleasures of island-hopping. Take some goggles or a mask and have fun chasing the fishes. When you feel like a change, Panormos has a windsurfing school, as well as several large but friendly restaurants smack on the beach. The islands' staple diet is grilled squid or lamb chops and chips, with a side order of horiatiki , or \"Greek salad\". Simple food, cheap and well cooked. Within a few days you may find yourself craving pizza. Skopelos is best known for its churches: 120 in Skopelos Town itself, 300 in the island as a whole, for less than 5,000 locals. On a good day, you can have one to yourself. One morning, I walked the dusty road to the Monastery of the Metamorphosis, high in the hills to the east of Skopelos Town, where whitewashed walls encircle a cool, dark chapel tended by a grey-bearded monk. Outside, a weatherbeaten bench overlooks a valley lined with pine woods and olive groves, where goat bells clank and yellow and green butterflies flutter by. The sun blazed down, but a fig tree offered a little shade. Birds sang while I watched a stream of ants carrying fragments of grass and leaf back to their nest. Is there any finer holiday activity than watching someone else work? But the prettiest of the three islands is Alonissos, the least populated of the Sporades with a winter popula tion of just 1,500. It's also the least wooded, but the locals do their best to make up for that with potplants. Alonissos also boasts dozens of quiet sandy beaches, accessible only by boat or dirt track (the Sporades aren't big on roads). The main settlement is Patitiri, a rock-circled bay full of laid-back hotels and tavernas. When you get sick of stuffing your face among the bougainvillea, a bus or taxi will take you 2km up the hill to Old Alonissos. One fellow passenger pointed out: \"Sun every day in Greece; no sun in London.\" How very true. Old Alonissos is a 3D maze of steep, narrow alleys that suddenly open on to spectacular views. This was the island's capital until it was devastated by an earthquake in 1965. Greece's military rulers ordered its population rehoused in the port, but now the ruins have been bought up and renovated, mainly by foreigners who look down their noses at the \"ugly\" new town. Every second building in Old Alonissos is a smart bar or restaurant, and there are too many stalls selling Camden Market-style trinkets, but the place stays just the right side of airy-fairy. Perhaps it's the cats. Everywhere in the islands, mangy specimens beg for scraps while you eat, occasionally spitting at each other. At one maritime-themed bar in Old Alonissos, I was treated to a full-on fight, as two moggies chased each other under and over the tables until the owner finally had to push them away with his broom. Alonissos is the quietest of these islands, but the nightlife is there if you go looking for it. After dinner in Old Alonissos, I popped into one of Patitiri's disco-bars for a nightcap and somehow didn't get home till 6am. This put the mockers on a planned boat trip to the nearby monk seal colony, but a local confided that you're more likely to see a martian than one of these endangered animals. After Alonissos, Skiathos comes as a shock, with its crowds and the constant whine of scooters. The best-known of the Sporades, Skiathos balloons from 5,000 souls in winter to more than 50,000 in high season. The main settlement, Skiathos Town, is just minutes away from the airport, a mass of waterside bars and restaurants whose owners wave their wares at you and beckon you in. The island has just one metalled road, which runs along the south coast and serves countless sandy beaches separated by rocky headlands full of umbrella pines. At the western end of the island, Banana Beach is said to be the finest nudist stretch in the Mediterranean; further east, Kolios offers a gentle sweep of sand with a friendly watering hole, the Sand Bar Caf\u00e9. Cars, bicycles and scooters can all be rented in Skiathos Town; you'll need one of these to reach the ruins of the island's former capital, Castro, at the northernmost point of the island five or six hilly and dusty kilometres down a dirt track consisting entirely of hairpin bends full of suicidal Swedes on scooters. This picturesque mess of houses and churches clings to a headland that offers terrifying drops and stunning views. A narrow track leads down to a sandy beach, where a no-frills taverna offers basic fare and a horse occasionally pops in to beg for food. Also well worth a trip is the islet of Tsougria, 4km south of Skiathos Town, which has the usual golden beach, plus a taverna and a chance to rent a kayak. I sailed there on a private yacht, hired for the day - but if I told you the details of that trip, you'd only get jealous.

      "body": "<p>The fiasco over the rebuilding project dates back to May 1997, when the Fiat-owned construction company, Impregilo, one of five applicants whose design projects were considered by a commission set up by the Prefecture, was awarded the contract. Work began that summer and proceeded smoothly for almost a year. Hopes that La Fenice might re-open by the millennium were dashed when the rival consortium, Holzmann-Romagnoli - which had challenged the adjudicating commission's decision on the basis that Impregilo's bid, though cheaper than its own, was incomplete - won its appeal. Rebuilding ground to a halt. Impregilo counter-appealed, insisting that the judges had been misled by a last-minute addition to Holzmann's design, created by the architect Aldo Rossi, which, according to Impregilo, was not part of the original specifications for the theatre's reconstruction.</p> <p>The disputed area consisted of an extensive property belonging to Emilio Baldi, who had his home and a restaurant abutting La Fenice: this was to provide space for a small auditorium. Although the sale of the property eventually went ahead, a friend of Baldi's says that the restaurateur, on practical grounds, refused, despite threats, to sell a large basement used as a laundry for his restaurant linen, a facility that, in this city, is virtually irreplaceable.</p> <p>For the next 18 months, lawyers for the various parties locked horns in and out of court. When finally the State Council in Rome - the highest court of administrative justice to which the appeal was presented - ruled in Holzmann's favour, a third disgruntled bidder, the Genoese company Carena, insisted that the entire process begin again. After more appeals and counter-appeals, Holzmann was awarded the 90 billion lire (\u00a330m) contract in October 1999 and began work, by which time the re-opening date was rescheduled provisionally for late 2001. It has since been further extended, to spring 2003.</p> <p>But, given the unique problems of any construction work in Venice and the little so far accomplished, even that date seems ludicrously unrealistic. However, not everything is bleak. Despite still being housed in a tent, the Fenice Opera Company, rising to what they unequivocally call \"this positive challenge\", has continued to present varied and ambitious seasons of opera, music and dance. There are, reportedly, ample existing funds for the project: more than 90% of the cost is being met by insurance, state and local funding, with back-up from generous private donations controlled by such strictly supervised charities as Venice In Peril. To the delight of local architects, such as Francesco Da Mosto, who worked on the new plan for La Fenice with its original creator Aldo Rossi, killed in a car crash in 1997, the original architectural plans and written instructions by the engineers Tommaso and Giambattista Meduna, who rebuilt La Fenice in 1837, have been discovered in a forgotten archive.</p> <p>This means it is possible to recreate precisely both the theatre's celebrated perfect acoustics and its aesthetic grandeur. \"The decorative details are an integral part of the acoustic principles,\" explains Da Mosto excitedly. \"The Medunas established specific techniques for cutting wood, so waves of sound from the orchestra and stage travel along the longest, uniform lines within the grain and are carried evenly to every part of the auditorium. Even the smallest bit of decorative wood panelling was cut this way and angled in a special way. The curves of each balcony, every papier-mache decoration was specially placed to ensure perfect transmission of sound. All these decorative elements will be replaced as they were, according to those organic principles.\" By studying Graziano Arici's photographs of the interior and such films as Visconti's Senso, largely shot inside La Fenice, he insists a perfect replica of the auditorium will be recreated.</p> <p>But when? Shortly after Holzmann took over the project, work was suspended for seven months when Roman and medieval artefacts were unearthed beneath the theatre's foundations. Although reconstruction work began in earnest last May, so far only the perimeter walls have been reinforced, the foundations prepared for the installation of underground storage and rehearsal rooms and electronic stage equipment; it is, however, just possible to distinguish which areas will eventually become the auditorium, the proscenium arch and the stage. Venice's new mayor, Paolo Costa, ex rector of Venice University and a former minister of public works, has created for himself the temporary role of \"commissioner extraordinary\" with personal responsibility for the rebuilding project. At a press conference on December 4, he publicly lambasted Holzmann for falling behind schedule and so far completing less than 10% of the total building work. Holzmann's response has been to demand another 30 billion lire, almost one-third of the total budget, to continue rebuilding, blaming the town hall for recently requesting modifications to Rossi's original plan, changes that, it argues, will cause delays and extra costs. Reconstruction is again at a standstill. A legal battle seems imminent, and the government has already approached the state legislature for guidance about the new costs of rebuilding.</p> <p>Given that all my most recent requests, following the new year, to Costa, his press secretary and representatives of Holzmann- Romagnoli for information on this latest impasse have been ignored, it is impossible to determine the next twist in the plot. So far, no one in the whole bizarre saga comes out of this well. Although Giovanna Melandri, Italy's minister of culture, is known to be incensed over the whole affair, having released extra government funds for the rebuilding two years ago, she changed her mind about speaking to me without any explanation. Yet it was she, when commenting on Italy's creaky arts administration, who recently admitted, \"We have to change the mentality in this country. Culture is a national asset, our equivalent of oilfields or diamonds.\" If so, then La Fenice must surely prove the ultimate challenge. Perhaps that is why an American adviser, Daniel Berger, who for 38 years was responsible for merchandising at New York's Metropolitan Museum, has been called in.</p> <p>Berger, now an adviser to both the ministry of culture in Rome and to Paolo Costa in Venice, is optimistic about the future of La Fenice, while being bracingly candid about \"the accepted Italian style of doing these things\". Which makes the Fenice affair, though deplorable, in his view, nothing unusual: \"For every winner of an important contract, there are two who make a ricorso - a petition to the courts. Here, they don't accept, as in England or America, the finality of any decision. In Florence, we had five consortiums bidding to set up a new merchandising and publishing venture at the Uffizi. Hours after the winner was announced, two of the losers were in front of the magistrates, saying their bids hadn't been properly considered.\"</p> <p>While dismissing the current fracas between the town council and Holzmann as \"a pissing match\", he genuinely believes that Costa is the only man who can succeed in getting La Fenice built, against all odds. \"He was elected last June, and inherited a terrible nightmare, not of his making. That makes him especially determined to see this through. The man is tough and businesslike, and not a bullshitter. He knows the whole world is watching. He's made it his mission to ensure that La Fenice gets built - soon. And it will.\" Maybe. As everyone knows, the saga isn't over until the fat lady sings.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The fiasco over the rebuilding project dates back to May 1997, when the Fiat-owned construction company, Impregilo, one of five applicants whose design projects were considered by a commission set up by the Prefecture, was awarded the contract. Work began that summer and proceeded smoothly for almost a year. Hopes that La Fenice might re-open by the millennium were dashed when the rival consortium, Holzmann-Romagnoli - which had challenged the adjudicating commission's decision on the basis that Impregilo's bid, though cheaper than its own, was incomplete - won its appeal. Rebuilding ground to a halt. Impregilo counter-appealed, insisting that the judges had been misled by a last-minute addition to Holzmann's design, created by the architect Aldo Rossi, which, according to Impregilo, was not part of the original specifications for the theatre's reconstruction. The disputed area consisted of an extensive property belonging to Emilio Baldi, who had his home and a restaurant abutting La Fenice: this was to provide space for a small auditorium. Although the sale of the property eventually went ahead, a friend of Baldi's says that the restaurateur, on practical grounds, refused, despite threats, to sell a large basement used as a laundry for his restaurant linen, a facility that, in this city, is virtually irreplaceable. For the next 18 months, lawyers for the various parties locked horns in and out of court. When finally the State Council in Rome - the highest court of administrative justice to which the appeal was presented - ruled in Holzmann's favour, a third disgruntled bidder, the Genoese company Carena, insisted that the entire process begin again. After more appeals and counter-appeals, Holzmann was awarded the 90 billion lire (\u00a330m) contract in October 1999 and began work, by which time the re-opening date was rescheduled provisionally for late 2001. It has since been further extended, to spring 2003. But, given the unique problems of any construction work in Venice and the little so far accomplished, even that date seems ludicrously unrealistic. However, not everything is bleak. Despite still being housed in a tent, the Fenice Opera Company, rising to what they unequivocally call \"this positive challenge\", has continued to present varied and ambitious seasons of opera, music and dance. There are, reportedly, ample existing funds for the project: more than 90% of the cost is being met by insurance, state and local funding, with back-up from generous private donations controlled by such strictly supervised charities as Venice In Peril. To the delight of local architects, such as Francesco Da Mosto, who worked on the new plan for La Fenice with its original creator Aldo Rossi, killed in a car crash in 1997, the original architectural plans and written instructions by the engineers Tommaso and Giambattista Meduna, who rebuilt La Fenice in 1837, have been discovered in a forgotten archive. This means it is possible to recreate precisely both the theatre's celebrated perfect acoustics and its aesthetic grandeur. \"The decorative details are an integral part of the acoustic principles,\" explains Da Mosto excitedly. \"The Medunas established specific techniques for cutting wood, so waves of sound from the orchestra and stage travel along the longest, uniform lines within the grain and are carried evenly to every part of the auditorium. Even the smallest bit of decorative wood panelling was cut this way and angled in a special way. The curves of each balcony, every papier-mache decoration was specially placed to ensure perfect transmission of sound. All these decorative elements will be replaced as they were, according to those organic principles.\" By studying Graziano Arici's photographs of the interior and such films as Visconti's Senso, largely shot inside La Fenice, he insists a perfect replica of the auditorium will be recreated. But when? Shortly after Holzmann took over the project, work was suspended for seven months when Roman and medieval artefacts were unearthed beneath the theatre's foundations. Although reconstruction work began in earnest last May, so far only the perimeter walls have been reinforced, the foundations prepared for the installation of underground storage and rehearsal rooms and electronic stage equipment; it is, however, just possible to distinguish which areas will eventually become the auditorium, the proscenium arch and the stage. Venice's new mayor, Paolo Costa, ex rector of Venice University and a former minister of public works, has created for himself the temporary role of \"commissioner extraordinary\" with personal responsibility for the rebuilding project. At a press conference on December 4, he publicly lambasted Holzmann for falling behind schedule and so far completing less than 10% of the total building work. Holzmann's response has been to demand another 30 billion lire, almost one-third of the total budget, to continue rebuilding, blaming the town hall for recently requesting modifications to Rossi's original plan, changes that, it argues, will cause delays and extra costs. Reconstruction is again at a standstill. A legal battle seems imminent, and the government has already approached the state legislature for guidance about the new costs of rebuilding. Given that all my most recent requests, following the new year, to Costa, his press secretary and representatives of Holzmann- Romagnoli for information on this latest impasse have been ignored, it is impossible to determine the next twist in the plot. So far, no one in the whole bizarre saga comes out of this well. Although Giovanna Melandri, Italy's minister of culture, is known to be incensed over the whole affair, having released extra government funds for the rebuilding two years ago, she changed her mind about speaking to me without any explanation. Yet it was she, when commenting on Italy's creaky arts administration, who recently admitted, \"We have to change the mentality in this country. Culture is a national asset, our equivalent of oilfields or diamonds.\" If so, then La Fenice must surely prove the ultimate challenge. Perhaps that is why an American adviser, Daniel Berger, who for 38 years was responsible for merchandising at New York's Metropolitan Museum, has been called in. Berger, now an adviser to both the ministry of culture in Rome and to Paolo Costa in Venice, is optimistic about the future of La Fenice, while being bracingly candid about \"the accepted Italian style of doing these things\". Which makes the Fenice affair, though deplorable, in his view, nothing unusual: \"For every winner of an important contract, there are two who make a ricorso - a petition to the courts. Here, they don't accept, as in England or America, the finality of any decision. In Florence, we had five consortiums bidding to set up a new merchandising and publishing venture at the Uffizi. Hours after the winner was announced, two of the losers were in front of the magistrates, saying their bids hadn't been properly considered.\" While dismissing the current fracas between the town council and Holzmann as \"a pissing match\", he genuinely believes that Costa is the only man who can succeed in getting La Fenice built, against all odds. \"He was elected last June, and inherited a terrible nightmare, not of his making. That makes him especially determined to see this through. The man is tough and businesslike, and not a bullshitter. He knows the whole world is watching. He's made it his mission to ensure that La Fenice gets built - soon. And it will.\" Maybe. As everyone knows, the saga isn't over until the fat lady sings.",

      "body": "<p><strong> Emerald Germs of Ireland</strong> </p> <p> Patrick McCabe </p> <p> 384pp, Picador, \u00a314.99 </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000349087,00.html\">Buy it at a discount at BOL</a></p> <p> His neighbours dismiss him as \"a complete and utter oddity\", but if you're a Patrick McCabe fan you'll recognise the main character of his latest novel. Pat has been around since The Butcher Boy as abused son, bullied schoolboy, village scarecrow or anarchist, the bright-enough child beaten into the darkness of his own bent imagination by the cruelty of dysfunctional parents and an uncaring community. You'll recognise versions of the brutish father, too, and a mother whose violent emotions swoop between sentimentality and hate. </p> <p>If, like the author, you grew up in an Ireland struggling between De Valera's old, anti-materialist ideals and the bright promises of the modern world, you'll remember quaint publications like Emerald Gems of Ireland . Through the late 1950s and 1960s, their blurry newsprint lined up beside the shiny new titles of the day to recall the disappearing songs and stories of some kinder age. </p> <p>Cleverly, McCabe has fitted his novel into that faded literary frame, so rendering his sudden passages of gore and mayhem all the more colourful when they appear. Pat McNab is an innocent, pulled back and forth between those extremes of old and new Ireland. Tales of his disillusionment, of sweet optimism dashed again and again by the selfishness of the real world, are strung together in unchronological order like the rough \"gems\" of those forgotten magazines. </p> <p>Insights into Pat's horrible childhood, adolescence and middle age are set between the mawkish songs of heroism and love that have helped shape his dreams. The disjunction between reality and the cosy old images of small-town Irish life set the scene for Pat's descent into madness. Beginning on his father, our hero becomes avenger, dispatching his adversaries into eternity \"like they were the shite of fleas... a sack of good for nothing germs!\" </p> <p>Language is shaped to serve the author's bitter wit. He uses a multiple narrator, who lurches between naturalism and pretension, like the writers of old Emerald Gems. At one stage, Pat's face becomes so taut with fury \"it was as though he possessed a length of carpet for a mouth\". As more and more dead bodies feed the laurel bushes, Pat's predicament is compared to Macbeth's: \"I am in blood stepp'd in so far that, should I wade no more, returning were as tedious as go o'er.\" Elsewhere, knowing archaism is used, as when the killer steps out into a morning \"spreading its gossamer cloak across the countryside\". </p> <p>Like Pat's darkening imagination, some horrific scenes are lightened by memories of film. Disinterring his mother's disintegrating body to sit with her \"in the warmth\" suggests another more famous mammy's boy. Did Psycho inspire Pat to kill? Or simply to dress up in his mother's wedding dress when dispatching some of his victims? Certainly, a peyote trip into border territory is delivered in the jerky style of spaghetti westerns; but a long sequence in which Pat captures a bagful of money from some gun-slinging gangsters travels beyond the dreamworld of Bonnie and Clyde to a chilling reminder of the real-life murderers who operate just a few miles from him in Northern Ireland. </p> <p>Yet there is no chance to reflect. A relentless comic narrative sweeps tragedy aside. Often it is delivered as brilliant one-liners, but it can slip between irony and slapstick, as when a black American baddie tries to shake down the local drapery store. Having felled him with a baseball bat, the old Irish proprietor informs him that \"this ass-mother... was shakin' shook in Brooklyn when you was knee high to a culpepper coolshank!\" </p> <p>Yet for all its quirkiness and ventriloquism, the novel's structure fails to satisfy. The changing narrator and Pat's unchronological history create a maze that even the most persistent reader might find difficult to follow. Also, by beginning in the middle of McCabe's (already familiar) psychosis, the build-up of tension as each new experience accumulates upon the last is never allowed to develop. Instead we must examine the varying texts as psychologists, picking out small germs of truths from so many falsehoods. </p> <p>In that, the sharp-eyed reader will be rewarded. Evidence that seeps between funny digs and fantastic nastiness makes McCabe's continuing thesis about the deep-laid ambivalence of Irish life all too clear. The parody of voices that once peddled old fictions about Ireland's \"difference\" as a nation of saints, scholars and comic songsters may amuse those who can remember them. But the raw fury with which they are mocked is not funny at all: these fake gems are splattered with real blood.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Emerald Germs of Ireland Patrick McCabe 384pp, Picador, \u00a314.99 Buy it at a discount at BOL His neighbours dismiss him as \"a complete and utter oddity\", but if you're a Patrick McCabe fan you'll recognise the main character of his latest novel. Pat has been around since The Butcher Boy as abused son, bullied schoolboy, village scarecrow or anarchist, the bright-enough child beaten into the darkness of his own bent imagination by the cruelty of dysfunctional parents and an uncaring community. You'll recognise versions of the brutish father, too, and a mother whose violent emotions swoop between sentimentality and hate. If, like the author, you grew up in an Ireland struggling between De Valera's old, anti-materialist ideals and the bright promises of the modern world, you'll remember quaint publications like Emerald Gems of Ireland . Through the late 1950s and 1960s, their blurry newsprint lined up beside the shiny new titles of the day to recall the disappearing songs and stories of some kinder age. Cleverly, McCabe has fitted his novel into that faded literary frame, so rendering his sudden passages of gore and mayhem all the more colourful when they appear. Pat McNab is an innocent, pulled back and forth between those extremes of old and new Ireland. Tales of his disillusionment, of sweet optimism dashed again and again by the selfishness of the real world, are strung together in unchronological order like the rough \"gems\" of those forgotten magazines. Insights into Pat's horrible childhood, adolescence and middle age are set between the mawkish songs of heroism and love that have helped shape his dreams. The disjunction between reality and the cosy old images of small-town Irish life set the scene for Pat's descent into madness. Beginning on his father, our hero becomes avenger, dispatching his adversaries into eternity \"like they were the shite of fleas... a sack of good for nothing germs!\" Language is shaped to serve the author's bitter wit. He uses a multiple narrator, who lurches between naturalism and pretension, like the writers of old Emerald Gems. At one stage, Pat's face becomes so taut with fury \"it was as though he possessed a length of carpet for a mouth\". As more and more dead bodies feed the laurel bushes, Pat's predicament is compared to Macbeth's: \"I am in blood stepp'd in so far that, should I wade no more, returning were as tedious as go o'er.\" Elsewhere, knowing archaism is used, as when the killer steps out into a morning \"spreading its gossamer cloak across the countryside\". Like Pat's darkening imagination, some horrific scenes are lightened by memories of film. Disinterring his mother's disintegrating body to sit with her \"in the warmth\" suggests another more famous mammy's boy. Did Psycho inspire Pat to kill? Or simply to dress up in his mother's wedding dress when dispatching some of his victims? Certainly, a peyote trip into border territory is delivered in the jerky style of spaghetti westerns; but a long sequence in which Pat captures a bagful of money from some gun-slinging gangsters travels beyond the dreamworld of Bonnie and Clyde to a chilling reminder of the real-life murderers who operate just a few miles from him in Northern Ireland. Yet there is no chance to reflect. A relentless comic narrative sweeps tragedy aside. Often it is delivered as brilliant one-liners, but it can slip between irony and slapstick, as when a black American baddie tries to shake down the local drapery store. Having felled him with a baseball bat, the old Irish proprietor informs him that \"this ass-mother... was shakin' shook in Brooklyn when you was knee high to a culpepper coolshank!\" Yet for all its quirkiness and ventriloquism, the novel's structure fails to satisfy. The changing narrator and Pat's unchronological history create a maze that even the most persistent reader might find difficult to follow. Also, by beginning in the middle of McCabe's (already familiar) psychosis, the build-up of tension as each new experience accumulates upon the last is never allowed to develop. Instead we must examine the varying texts as psychologists, picking out small germs of truths from so many falsehoods. In that, the sharp-eyed reader will be rewarded. Evidence that seeps between funny digs and fantastic nastiness makes McCabe's continuing thesis about the deep-laid ambivalence of Irish life all too clear. The parody of voices that once peddled old fictions about Ireland's \"difference\" as a nation of saints, scholars and comic songsters may amuse those who can remember them. But the raw fury with which they are mocked is not funny at all: these fake gems are splattered with real blood.",

But just how free can it get? The success of Linux, a sophisticated computer operating system that is available at zero cost, raises many questions about intellectual property in the electronic era. But does the so-called Linux \"revolution\" extend beyond the twilight world of caffeine-guzzling, VDU-tanned geeks? Could other \"content creators\" - writers, painters, musicians - ever prosper by giving their stuff away gratis? Glyn Moody's diligently researched book doesn't offer answers, but it does a useful job of providing the background to the arguments. </p> <p>In the early months of 1991, Finnish student Linus Torvalds bought a PC to tinker with, and decided he wanted to program a \"kernel\" - the heart of any operating system. He christened the project Linux. Soon Torvalds was joined by eager helpers on the internet, to whom he delegated specific tasks of debugging and coding, and within a few years there was a community of thousands working on the project in their spare time. By the end of the 1990s, Linux was so popular - owing to its adoption by behemoths such as IBM - that it was perceived in some quarters as a threat to Microsoft. </p> <p>Linux initiated the \"open source\" movement. When you buy a Microsoft program, for example, you effectively get a very large binary number. Your computer understands this number, but it is impossible to look at the 0s and 1s and infer just how the program was written. You don't have the source code - the language in which it was programmed - and that is what protects Microsoft's rights in the software. But Linux is distributed as open source - meaning that anyone with programming knowledge can peek under the bonnet and change it.

      "bodyText": "Rebel Code: Linux and the Open Source Revolution Glyn Moody 334pp, Penguin, \u00a312.99 Buy it at a discount at BOL Information wants to be free, runs the old hackers' slogan. But just how free can it get? The success of Linux, a sophisticated computer operating system that is available at zero cost, raises many questions about intellectual property in the electronic era. But does the so-called Linux \"revolution\" extend beyond the twilight world of caffeine-guzzling, VDU-tanned geeks? Could other \"content creators\" - writers, painters, musicians - ever prosper by giving their stuff away gratis? Glyn Moody's diligently researched book doesn't offer answers, but it does a useful job of providing the background to the arguments. In the early months of 1991, Finnish student Linus Torvalds bought a PC to tinker with, and decided he wanted to program a \"kernel\" - the heart of any operating system. He christened the project Linux. Soon Torvalds was joined by eager helpers on the internet, to whom he delegated specific tasks of debugging and coding, and within a few years there was a community of thousands working on the project in their spare time. By the end of the 1990s, Linux was so popular - owing to its adoption by behemoths such as IBM - that it was perceived in some quarters as a threat to Microsoft. Linux initiated the \"open source\" movement. When you buy a Microsoft program, for example, you effectively get a very large binary number. Your computer understands this number, but it is impossible to look at the 0s and 1s and infer just how the program was written. You don't have the source code - the language in which it was programmed - and that is what protects Microsoft's rights in the software. But Linux is distributed as open source - meaning that anyone with programming knowledge can peek under the bonnet and change it. That is how the Linux system got built, without vast corporate resources and hundreds of engineers on the payroll. The process, then, is new and interesting. But in spite of the passion evinced by the hacker priesthood, and in spite of its corporate and internet-server success, Linux is never going to be a mass-market consumer operating system like Windows or Mac OS. Torvalds's first internet posting said that Linux was going to be \"a program for hackers by a hacker\", and this remains true. If you are excited by the idea of typing obscure commands into a black window to dick around with your computer's guts, you'll love it. But if you just want to use your computer for word-processing, web-surfing, or whatever, you'd better avoid it like the plague. So are the politics of this \"revolution\" applicable outside the computing sphere?

As one programmer explains to Moody: \"It's sort of the opposite of design by committee. You get all the benefits of this huge pool of ideas, but it's not a democratic system.

They said they were appalled that the hospital would hand over human tissue without the explicit consent of the patients' parent or guardian. </p> <p>\"This brings us right back to the issue of openness and informed consent,\" said Ed Bradley of the support group Pity II. \"Pity II is not against research. But the hospital has ignored the families and not taken them into account at all.\" </p> <p>Had they been asked, he said, the parents would probably have agreed to use of the tissue. </p> <p>Ministers, alarmed at yet another escalation of the Alder Hey crisis, moved swiftly to condemn any exchange of cash for organs. \"This is yet another piece of deeply distressing news for the parents of children treated at Alder Hey,\" the health secretary, Alan Milburn, said. However, he took pains to point out that, according to the hospital, it happened between 1991 and 1993, then stopped because of concerns among staff that accepting donations for organs might be unethical. </p> <p>\"This was a particular practice which was happening in the early 90s at Alder Hey and, it seems, some other hospitals,\" he said. \"The NHS already knows this practice of taking organs without consent is totally unacceptable to this government.\" </p> <p>The government would issue further guidance to the NHS, he said, hinting that it would form part of their response to the Alder Hey report, which is published next Tuesday. </p> <p>To the parents, the revelations are just one more betrayal by the hospital. They claim Alder Hey released damning information about the extent of its storage of organs with apparent reluctance and, in their eyes, only under pressure. </p> <p>Mr Bradley pointed to one contradiction in the dates - the hospital said thymus glands were passed to Aventis Pasteur between 1991 and 1993. The company dates it between 1989 and 1995. </p> <p>Ian Cohen, solicitor for the families, said they had noticed that the thymus gland - listed by Alder Hey as tissue removed from some children during heart surgery - was not among the organs returned to parents whose children later died. He said they had been asking what had happened for 15 months. </p> <p>\"I don't think the removal of the gland can be criticised if it improves the outcome of surgery,\" Mr Cohen added. \"The issue then becomes one of informed consent. My understanding is that, in relation to the local ethics guidance, explicit consent is required before an organ can be passed on to a pharmaceutical company. </p> <p>\"We have to ask what has the company used the organ for? We have been told that it has been used for a commercial venture, albeit an anti-rejection drug. If money was paid, what has happened to that money? We want to see the records and have full disclosure for that.\" </p> <p>Dr Mark Caswell, clinical director of pathology at Alder Hey, said the hospital had thought it was important to help the production of the drug until 1993. \"But in 1993 concerns arose over the commercial transaction and the supply was stopped,\" he added. \"The glands are still removed but are now treated in same way as an appendix. They are not sold for any commercial gain. </p> <p>\"Parental consent was sought for the operations but not for the actual removal of the gland. It is unclear who initiated the contract but it was a widespread practice and Alder Hey was not the only hospital to supply pharmaceutical companies. </p> <p>\"I don't think parents were told but if these things were happening at the present time everything would be fully disclosed to parents and they would have the full authority. The glands were used to develop a drug used in the treatment of very ill children. If parents feel something causes further distress then we regret that. In retrospect the fact that there was a financial aspect involved should have been stressed to parents.\" </p> <p>But the revelations, the way they have emerged and the medical profession's surprise that anybody should feel concern underlines that the issue of how hospitals treat human bodies is still far from settled. </p> <p>James Underwood, the vice-president of the Royal College of Pathologists, said that a very wide range of human tissue was increasingly sought by drug companies for use in the manufacture of medicines and for testing new drugs. If unwanted human tissue, the detritus of operations, were not used, he pointed out, then there would be still more recourse to animal experimentation. </p> <p>\"It is something that happens all the time and increasingly because pharmaceutical companies and the developers of new technologies are all increasingly seeking the help of hospitals and doctors to get access to human tissue,\" he said. </p> <p>The Nuffield Council on Bioethics produced a report in 1995 which recommends that no payment should be made, although hospitals must be reimbursed for their administrative expenses. It also stipulates that patients should be told what their tissue will be used for and asked for properly informed consent. </p> <p>In practice, patients or their guardians sign a form agreeing to the use of tissue for research but they may not always have been fully told what that may entail. </p> <p>The Medical Research Council is also working on guidelines, but the latest row is likely to lead to something with the force of law behind it. Opposition spokesmen yesterday called for the government to issue guidelines of its own. </p> <p>Last night Aventis Pasteur issued a statement saying that an annual donation of less than \u00a310 per waste fragment was made to the hospital's cardiac department to contribute towards expenses such as \"nurses' training\"and the fitting out of accommodation for parents. </p> <p><strong> Vital role in babies</strong><br> </p> <p> The thymus is a small piece of lymphatic tissue that is crucial to the health of a newborn baby, but is pretty much surplus to requirements in an adult. </p> <p>The flat organ, situated in front of the heart immediately below the breastbone, gained its name from its resemblance in shape to a thyme leaf.

While it's challenging and interesting to work with new media, it's also how we will deliver more training in the future. While I love the job, too much travel is not great. I spent my last birthday in a fog-bound Paris airport while my friends had dinner without me. The thing I enjoy most is the fact that I am able to help create opportunities for people to develop - although the process can take much longer than I first think. I am often working with some of the business's most dynamic people, which is stimulating - plus it also gives me a view of the bigger picture which I would probably lack working as a tax consultant.",

It might sound pretentious, but it's important to appear au fait with the way your chosen industry is defining itself - particularly with fields such as IT and new media.\" </p> <p>It might sound trivial, but being unaware of phrases in everyday use in a particular industry shows a lack of research, which most interviewers view very negatively. \"There is a huge amount of information out there these days - on every industry imaginable,\" believes Richard Newman, who runs the IT test team for a large telecommunications company. \"There's simply no excuse for going into an interview uninformed - it's one of the things that instantly puts me off a candidate - it smacks of not making an effort.\" </p> <p>According to Penny Hackett, author of The Selection Interview , all interviewers want to hear a solid reason as to why you have chosen their company. \"Most interviewers will ask why you have chosen to apply to their company and it's imperative to have an answer that is more than simply needing the money. Think about what appeals to you about the organisation - its aims or values system, and work that into your answer. Try to make it personal to you, rather than a general platitude about the company.\" </p> <p>Of course, it may be possible that you do simply want the job for the money or as a stop-gap until something better comes along. There's nothing wrong with taking a job for those reasons, but if an employer can see too clearly that this is your only motivation, they will rarely offer you a position. \"I have interviewed people who are clearly only in it for the money, as a temporary job - and it always shows,\" says Deborah Jones, advertising sales director for a radio station. \"They rarely have questions about the company, and have little enthusiasm. However much I like them, I won't employ them - it simply isn't worth my while.\" </p> <p>It can be hard to give a really good interview performance if the position is not your dream job, but you can motivate yourself by being determined to be offered the job, even if you turn it down. All interview experience is good experience - and any job offer is bound to increase your confidence. Dressing up your motivation is one thing, but remember to steer clear of any kind of dishonesty anywhere in the interview process. </p> <p>\"If you lie in an interview process you will invariably be caught out,\" says Noel Morgan, consultant at the Institute of Management. \"However tempting it might seem, never lie on your CV. Employers rely on CVs as a primary source of information about potential candidates; if at the interview you cannot back up what is on your CV, you will instantly have lost any chance of getting the job. Honesty in the interview is equally important; if you don't have that much relevant experience then say so - but temper it with an example of a situation where you have used a skill that would be relevant to the job.\" </p> <p>Deborah Jones adds: \"Candidates often worry if they don't feel they have enough experience, but enthusiasm and a good understanding of the industry can be just as important. If there is an interviewee who may not have done similar work before, but is excited by the prospect of learning new things and who displays an ability to think quickly and calmly, then I may well offer them the job.\" </p> <p>Often the most difficult aspect of an interview is getting your point across - how long to talk for or how much detail to get into. If an interviewer interrupts you mid-flow it can be hard not to take it negatively, but according to Penny Hackett, this isn't always the case. \"Bear in mind that interviewers are tight on time - if they do interrupt you, it may mean they just want to speed things up. </p> <p>\"Try to focus on the question you are answering. It may be possible to display a skill - say, resilience in a crisis - that happened whilst you were backpacking round Africa, but remember that the interviewer doesn't want, or need, to hear all the details of the trip.\" </p> <p>Ten or fifteen years ago it might have been unthinkable to use an anecdote from a holiday to display a work-related skill but, like most aspects of working life, the interview process has undergone deep-seated change in recent years. \"It's no longer about relevant experience or starting at the bottom and working up,\" says Noel Morgan. \"With all the new technology the job market is changing constantly and new skills are required - interviewers look for technical knowledge, but also innovative thinkers, people who can cope with change and are not unsettled by it.\" </p> <p>The old clich\u00e9s still hold true; polish your shoes, wear neutral, smart clothes, be on time - the importance of a good first impression is something that hasn't changed. \"It might sound intimidating, but I generally make a decision in the first three minutes,\" says Richard Newman. \"I may go on to change it, but in those first few moments you take so much in. I'm probably nervous, my senses are heightened, and you do get an instant feeling for the person - whether they appear positive, how they look, whether they are confident or defensive.\" </p> <p>If that sounds worrying then take heart; interviews have never been more flexible or interviewers more free-thinking than they are today. The internet means that research is easier - no longer any need to get the dress code wrong; simply check out the company's website. \"Interviews are far less predictable than they used to be,\" says Anne Hollier. \"And if you've done thorough research, planned some responses, and stay focused then they really can be fun.\" </p> <p>Interviews?

The policy does not cover them for some activities, including heliskiing, unless they pay a supplement. \u0095 For skiers making their own way to the Alps, Travel Deals (0845 399 3900) is offering three-night breaks in Morzine for \u00a3147 and seven nights for \u00a3199. The price includes transfers to and from Geneva airport or the nearest station and half-board at a chalet. The deals run until late April. \u0095 California's Lake Tahoe area is a great place to sample a cocktail of resorts. If you can get away by February 9, Ski Safari (020-7740 1221) is offering scheduled flights from London, a rental car and a week at the Viking Motor Lodge in South Lake Tahoe, which is linked by a new gondola lift to the ski area of Heavenly, for \u00a3479 - a reduction of \u00a3100 from the brochure. Accommodation is on a room-only basis but there are coffee and doughnuts for breakfast. Heavenly has excellent intermediate and tree skiing. Other resorts within easy reach are Squaw Valley, Kirkwood and Alpine Meadows.",

      "body": "<p>They remember the Comptons on the Moulsecoomb estate: Ronald, Margaret and their four sons, Ronald jnr, Stephen, Sean and Robert. The family hasn't lived there for 10 years, but mention of it has the effect of a sudden draught, sucking shut doors, delivering a bolt down the spine. </p> <p>\"Look at me, I'm shaking,\" said a resident last week, reminded of the family by news that four of the Compton men had been sentenced to join the fifth in prison. \"They were polite and well mannered, but it's what they brought into the neighbourhood. They moved on and they left the problem here.\" </p> <p>The problem was heroin. At Hove crown court in east Sussex last week, Judge Anthony Scott-Gall ruled that the Compton family business was a \"vile and wicked trade\" of sufficient reach to warrant sentences totalling 21 years. </p> <p>The father, Ronald snr, 58, was convicted of drug trafficking. His \"lieutenants\" Stephen, 38, and Sean, 28, were convicted of conspiracy to supply drugs, and Robert, 36, was found guilty of possessing cash proceeds from drug trafficking. The eldest son, Ronald jnr, 39, is two years into an eight-year sentence for possessing heroin with intent to supply. </p> <p>\"They like to think of themselves as loveable rogues,\" said Detective Inspector Paul Grundy, who lead the inquiry. \"But they are not. They are dealers in death.\" </p> <p>The rise of the Compton family from the privations of Moulsecoomb to the mansions of Brighton's Tongdean neighbourhood is set against the decline of the addicts they supplied. Brighton and Hove has the highest number of heroin-related deaths of any region in the country. In 1999, the figure was over 35; by last June that record had already been beaten. </p> <p>\"It is easier to get a bag of heroin than a cup of tea in Brighton,\" said Neil Ansell, regional manager of the Big Issue. \"Heroin is more available than cannabis. I know of several people who have died of overdoses since the beginning of January.\" </p> <p>\"It is recognised that seaside resorts attract an itinerant population of people with social problems,\" said a spokeswoman for Addaction, the needle exchange and counselling service which since last May has registered an average of 55 addicts a month. To indicate the extent of Brighton's drugs trade, the number of addicts registering at the service's east London branch, is only 40-45 a month. Into this scene came the Comptons, who over two decades would make an estimated \u00a33m from the heroin trade. It is a commonplace of drug dealing that the higher up the supply chain you operate, the less likely you are to be drug-using yourself. The remarkable thing about the Comptons is that despite their seniority, as heroin wholesalers, members of the family were themselves taking drugs and to an extent that threatened to destroy them. </p> <p><strong> Salutary effect</strong><br> </p> <p> In 1993, Robert Compton's wife Alison died from a heroin-related illness; Stephen Compton's partner Jacky died after an overdose of amphetamines. When Sean and Sasha Compton's baby girl was born, it was with an opiate addiction from which she is just now recovering. \"I hope that fact had a salutary effect on you,\" said Judge Scott-Gall while sentencing Sean to four and a half years' imprisonment. Sasha Compton sobbed before retreating to her six bedroom, mock-Tudor house with intercom and video entry facilities. </p> <p>The family business started three miles from the genteel lanes of Tongdean, in Brighton's Moulsecoomb estate, a district marked by the unhappy juxtaposition of frightened pensioners in well-kept houses with squalid dealers' homes bearing the scars of serial efforts to kick the doors in. The police have intelligence tracing the Compton family business back 15 years, to when the sons were teenagers and Ronald snr described himself as an antiques dealer. They did not operate on a grand scale. \"It made me laugh when they described Stephen as the 'banker' in the family,\" said a former neighbour, still fearful enough of recriminations to withhold his name. \"I remember seeing him dealing in broad daylight right outside the shop. But they were a great deal better than what came in after them.\" </p> <p>As the sons grew up, they acquired nominal trades for themselves: Robert was a \"jewellery dealer\"; Sean, despite the mansion and Mercedes he later purchased, identified himself as a \"handyman\"; Stephen followed his father into the \"antiques business\". </p> <p>As the dynasty grew and a steady supply of heroin was secured from London and Liverpool, the Compton parents moved to Woodingdean, a quiet hilltop area overlooking the sea, where Margaret Compton still lives. They began investing in property under the name Comptons of Brighton. Margaret Compton opened a florists in the city centre. \"I did well,\" she said last week, still maintaining the innocence if not of her husband (he pleaded guilty to charges of trafficking), then at least of her sons. \"We paid \u00a389,000 for this house and we've got a mortgage like anyone else. I had a car on hire purchase - now if I was rolling in all this drugs money, why would I do that?\" </p> <p><strong> Contaminated</strong><br> </p> <p> The evidence collated by the intelligence branch of the Sussex police was incontrovertible, however. When Ronald jnr's home was raided three years ago, police found 60kg of cannabis resin with a street value of between \u00a390,000 and \u00a3144,000. They also recovered \u00a313,750 worth of heroin. </p> <p>A year later, under Operation Sun Spot, 50 officers raided the rest of the family's homes and recovered 1.2kg of heroin worth \u00a350,000 and a stash of \u00a3170,000, most of it stuffed into tins of instant potato mix or hidden under floorboards. Some 95% of the notes were contaminated with traces of heroin. It was the biggest seizure in Sussex for 10 years and the end of one of Brighton's most extensive organised crime families. </p> <p>The ripple effect this bust has had on crime figures in Brighton is difficult to quantify. \"There will be a void,\" said Det Insp Grundy, pointing to Home Office figures which indicate that 1kg of heroin generates 220 victims of burglary and \u00a3220,000 worth of stolen property, and that each addicted offender executes somewhere in the region of 100 crimes a month. </p> <p>Drugs charities in Brighton, while applauding police efforts, were slightly more cautious. \"We haven't seen a dip yet,\" said a spokeswoman for Addaction. \"There is no evidence that our clients are finding it more difficult to get supplies. They would be visibly suffering if that were the case. The sad fact is that it doesn't take long for someone else to come in and take over the Comptons' territory.\" </p> <p>\"Arresting the Comptons is a hiccup in the drugs trade,\" said Mr Ansell. \"I have never known an addict in Brighton to say, 'I've been trying all day and I can't get a bag of heroin.' The street dealers will just get their supplies from someone else.\" </p> <p>He added: \"I've known dealers to have been put away in the morning, and by the afternoon, for their mobile phones to have been in use by other dealers who have taken over the good will of the business.\" </p> <p>The demand for heroin in Brighton has pushed prices to \u00a315-\u00a320 for a fraction of a gram and crack has started making an appearance. \"The way we are tackling it is to come down extremely hard on the dealers,\" said Glynn Jones, chief executive of Brighton and Hove council and chair of the Drug and Alcohol Action Team. \"We are coordinating with the health authority, the police and drugs charities to form a consistent approach, and ensure that action taken against dealers is not in conflict with the rehabilitation of users.\" The team is also working with Brighton schools to send in ex-addicts to talk to pupils about the dangers of drug taking. </p> <p>Margaret Compton, meanwhile, continues to plead persecution. Charges of trafficking against her remain on police files and the authorities are seeking to recover the rest of the money made from the business. \"He did a bad thing and he paid for it,\" she said of her husband, before driving the three miles to her daughter-in-law Sasha's house, to help with the newly fatherless grandchildren.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Devolution is drawing an indelible line across the UK. On one side students pay tuition fees, the teaching profession is in crisis, and many of the frail and elderly must pay to help meet the costs of their care. On the other there are no tuition fees, teachers have won a 21.5% pay deal, and now it looks as though all pensioners will enjoy free long-term care. </p> <p>Scottish executive proposals to fund long-term care for all pensioners has opened up the biggest policy divide yet between Holyrood and Westminster, and raised the spectre of a two-tier UK society split along the Scotland-England border. </p> <p>Yesterday, as pressure grew on the UK government to follow Scotland's lead, there were warnings that Labour risked losing the grey vote over the issue, and predictions that Scotland could become a giant nursing home as pensioners rushed north to take advantage of any better deal. </p> <p>Sir Stewart Sutherland, who chaired the royal commission which recommended free personal care for the elderly, said he believed its introduction in England and Wales was now inevitable. But the health minister, John Hutton, ruled out any policy reversal in England and Wales, where nursing care is free but personal care is means-tested. </p> <p>\"Devolution means that it is for the Scottish parliament to make decisions on its response to the royal commission on long-term care,\" he said. \"Both the government and the Scottish executive are committed to improving health and social care services for older people, but we are doing this in different ways.\" </p> <p>Analysts say the government and the public have to accept that Scotland can follow a different path, however awkward it might prove. \"This is exactly what the Scottish parliament was designed to do,\" said Malcolm Dickson, professor of politics at Strathclyde University. \"It was designed to take decisions that reflected the broadest strand of public opinion. </p> <p>\"But it is an embarrassment for Labour in the run-up to a general election and following on from tuition fees and the teachers' deal. What the Scottish parliament has done is provide a stick with which to beat the party. People will say if it's good for Scotland why is it not good for the rest of the UK? But this is something the political parties need to get used to in a post-devolution situation.\" </p> <p>Downing Street may have been spared some difficulty by the fact that the Scottish executive will not reveal the detail of its proposals or take a final decision until August. </p> <p>Yesterday, the Scottish National party and the Conservatives demanded clarification of the executive's apparent commitment on free long-term care, but the first minister Henry McLeish would not comment further. However, the Liberal Democrats, whose rebellion forced Mr McLeish to rethink his earlier refusal to fund all long-term care, said the executive's position was unequivocal. </p> <p><strong>Enormous impact</strong><br> </p> <p>Public policy experts say this will have an enormous social impact across the UK. \"This is absolutely huge,\" said Allyson Pollock, chair of the school of public policy at University College London. \"It is really a triumph for Scotland if they really do go down this road.

      "bodyText": "Devolution is drawing an indelible line across the UK. On one side students pay tuition fees, the teaching profession is in crisis, and many of the frail and elderly must pay to help meet the costs of their care. On the other there are no tuition fees, teachers have won a 21.5% pay deal, and now it looks as though all pensioners will enjoy free long-term care. Scottish executive proposals to fund long-term care for all pensioners has opened up the biggest policy divide yet between Holyrood and Westminster, and raised the spectre of a two-tier UK society split along the Scotland-England border. Yesterday, as pressure grew on the UK government to follow Scotland's lead, there were warnings that Labour risked losing the grey vote over the issue, and predictions that Scotland could become a giant nursing home as pensioners rushed north to take advantage of any better deal. Sir Stewart Sutherland, who chaired the royal commission which recommended free personal care for the elderly, said he believed its introduction in England and Wales was now inevitable. But the health minister, John Hutton, ruled out any policy reversal in England and Wales, where nursing care is free but personal care is means-tested. \"Devolution means that it is for the Scottish parliament to make decisions on its response to the royal commission on long-term care,\" he said. \"Both the government and the Scottish executive are committed to improving health and social care services for older people, but we are doing this in different ways.\" Analysts say the government and the public have to accept that Scotland can follow a different path, however awkward it might prove. \"This is exactly what the Scottish parliament was designed to do,\" said Malcolm Dickson, professor of politics at Strathclyde University. \"It was designed to take decisions that reflected the broadest strand of public opinion. \"But it is an embarrassment for Labour in the run-up to a general election and following on from tuition fees and the teachers' deal. What the Scottish parliament has done is provide a stick with which to beat the party. People will say if it's good for Scotland why is it not good for the rest of the UK? But this is something the political parties need to get used to in a post-devolution situation.\" Downing Street may have been spared some difficulty by the fact that the Scottish executive will not reveal the detail of its proposals or take a final decision until August. Yesterday, the Scottish National party and the Conservatives demanded clarification of the executive's apparent commitment on free long-term care, but the first minister Henry McLeish would not comment further. However, the Liberal Democrats, whose rebellion forced Mr McLeish to rethink his earlier refusal to fund all long-term care, said the executive's position was unequivocal. Enormous impact Public policy experts say this will have an enormous social impact across the UK. \"This is absolutely huge,\" said Allyson Pollock, chair of the school of public policy at University College London. \"It is really a triumph for Scotland if they really do go down this road. Over the last 20 to 30 years a lot of care has been shifted to being a personal responsilbity and what the Scottish parliament is saying is that care is now a universal collective responsiblity.\" Professor Pollok said the issue would shine a light on the \"covert privatisation\" of the health service in England and Wales. \"You have to ask why in England we are shunting more and more care into the unregulated private sector,\" she said. Teachers leaders have already warned that a recent 21.5% three-year pay deal for Scottish teachers will cause deep discontent south of the border. Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers, has said schools in England could find it even harder to attract teachers. \"I think morale of teachers in England and Wales will be severely depressed if they do not get at least equal treatment.\" Pensioners' groups in England have also warned that there will be great anger and bitterness if Scotland's elderly get a substantially better deal, but warnings that Scotland wll be colonised by middle class English pensioners have been dismissed. John Curtice, a political analyst at Strathlclyde University, whose elderly mother lives in Cornwall, said: \"At the point which people need that kind of care the last thing they are going to be capable of doing is making a long-distance, long-term move.\" Others say the biggest question raised by the care issue is how Scotland can afford to be so generous. The country has traditionally enjoyed a favourable slice of public funds in its \u00a317bn budget, some 25% higher per head than the rest of the UK. Some analysts say the care issue will increase pressure for a complete review of funding, but economist Arthur Midwinter says Scotland has an appropriate share for its level of need and can afford the \u00a3110m cost of universal free care. \"If it's a priority they can find the money,\" he said. \"I don't see any difficulty in funding it.

      "bodyText": "International concern about HMS Tireless, the British nuclear submarine stranded in Gibraltar, has deepened with a request for the European commission to investigate its radiation hazards. Officials in Brussels said last night that they were studying the request from the European ombudsman, acting on a complaint by several Andalusian groups about the warship, whose broken reactor has kept it in the colony's dock for the past seven months. As welders began repairing a fractured pipe in the reactor cooling system, diplomatic arm-twisting, cross-border protests and legal threats brought the row to a critical phase. Permission for the repairs to proceed came not from the Royal Navy in London but, in effect, from Gibraltar's chief minister, Peter Caruana, symbolising the Ministry of Defence's humbled status in dealing with the design problems of its SSN hunter-killer submarines. Ever since Tireless limped into the harbour on auxiliary diesel power on May 19 last year, after developing the leak which forced the crew to shut down the reactor, public unease in the region has grown. In Spain 60,000 people took part in a protest rally last weekend in the city of Algeciras, less than 10 miles away. Ten days ago Spanish Greenpeace activists who boarded the submarine were arrested. The issue has not only united environmental protesters on the Rock with those on the other side of the colony's border, it has also undermined the MoD's assumption that the citizens of Gibraltar will always rally round the crown to repel criticism from Spain. The British ambassador to Spain tried to calm some of the growing unrest last night by saying that the Tireless would return to Britain in about three months' time. \"The repairs will be finished at the end of March and [the submarine] will go at the end of April,\" Peter Torry told Spanish state television. But he did not say whether work would be done on the reactor before that. Caught in the middle, the Gibraltar government has established its own panel of nuclear experts in Britain to review the MoD's schedule of work on the submarine. Mr Caruana spoke to the defence secretary, Geoffrey Hoon, three times last week before being assured that welding would not begin on the nuclear reactor's cooling system until the panel had assessed the programme. The Gibraltar government said in a statement that it would \"oppose, and take such steps as it can, to prevent the carrying out of works prior to the advice of the government's panel\". It finally confirmed on Tuesday that it would allow welding on Tireless, but was withholding its approval for testing and starting the nuclear reactor. The Environmental Safety Group is worried about radiation leaks contaminating Gibraltar's main water desalination plant, and is considering legal action against the MoD. \"There should be an evacuation plan which ensures cooperation with the Spanish,\" said Janet Howitt, one of its leaders. \"We feel there is danger and it's being imposed on us.\" Local anxiety has been reinforced by the MoD's belated admission that similar cracks have appeared in the cooling system in at least four of the 12 other SSN nuclear submarines. The authorities now concede that there is a general problem. Identical repairs are being carried out on HMS Torbay in Devonport shipyard. The Gibraltar government insists that the repairs must be pioneered successfully there before they are attempted on Tireless. Vaughan Starkey, the senior MoD civil servant in Gibraltar, agreed that up to 90 litres of coolant water - at a very low radioactive level - was pumped overboard by the submarine before it docked last May. None, he says, has leaked since. And he dismissed reports that the reactor was nearing meltdown as untrue. \"The [nuclear] rods were never exposed,\" he said. \"It was never near meltdown.\" Private opinion polls in Gibraltar put the number opposed to Tireless's presence at between 50% and 70%. In the past 16 years the percentage of Gibraltar's working population employed by the MoD has fallen to 6% from 60%. But the MoD still holds considerable sway in the colony, and some believe it has little concern for its residents. \"[Tireless] shouldn't be there,\" said Jenny Martinez, who is expecting a baby shortly and was sitting on a bench looking over the harbour. \"Everybody's worried about it. I think the MoD will have the last word and do whatever they want.\"",

Companies simply cannot find people to employ, and this problem now extends way beyond the lack of people fluent in specialised computer languages or even the well-known difficulty the government is experiencing in recruiting newly qualified teachers and nurses. The country is now running dry of occupational therapists, doctors, accountants, social workers, engineers and even recruitment consultants: positions which just five years ago graduates and second and third jobbers were clamouring to fill. </p> <p>A report from The Cranfield School of Management this week reveals that 81% of manufacturers say it is difficult to recruit at the senior managerial level and that junior and middle managers are even harder to find.

This week the Institute for the Management of Information Systems, which represents IT companies, said it would press Chancellor Gordon Brown to use his pre-election Budget to give tax relief to employers and staff for IT training, making the skills shortage an election issue. </p> <p>So seriously does the government view the problem, that industry minister Kim Howells will next month launch a tour promoting, among other things, workforce training and retraining. The Cabinet Office's Performance and Innovation Unit has set up a task force which has nine months to report on the skills shortage problem in the UK. So-called third-leg funding for universities to liaise with businesses to ensure that degree courses teach relevant skills to students has been tripled. </p> <p>The problem has been bubbling under for the past 10 years as the country moved from recession in the early 90s into a period of full employment, as defined by economist John Maynard Keynes. Companies which slashed recruitment and training budgets in the lean times failed to reinflate them as the economy picked up. </p> <p>Neil Barnes, director of media recruitment specialists Phee Farrar Jones, says the problem has arisen because of a lack of investment in graduate recruitment. \"The underlying reason is because companies have not pre-planned graduate recruitment in the past so they don't have the talent coming through the company. Particularly in the area of new media there has also been the problem of sheer growth. It would have been a very brave person indeed who could have predicted numbers needed even three years ago. Although some start-ups have failed, others have grown beyond their wildest dreams.\" </p> <p>Kevin Hogarth, national resourcing director at professional services group Ernst &amp; Young, agrees: \"We're trying to recruit people who started their training in the early 90s and effectively we're reaping what we sowed. Numbers of graduate recruits were much reduced in all the accountancy firms because of economic conditions. Now we're trying to broaden the net of people we can attract who may have relevant experience.\" </p> <p>In the public sector, recruitment difficulties have more to do with poor pay and overwork. A spokeswoman for the public sector workers' union Unison says: \"There is a huge problem with a lack of social workers, particularly in inner city areas. Pay is always an issue, but there is also the problem of caseloads. Lisa Artherworry, the care worker involved in the Anna Climbie case, had 50% more work that she should have done, although I'm not excusing what happened. With residential social work there is even more of a problem: it is even worse paid and the environment is very difficult - you often find that there will be just one person sleeping in the home alone when there should be two people there.\" </p> <p>Separately, the Cabinet Office this week published a paper on the role immigrants can fill in helping slake the staffing drought as more and more blue-chip companies are actively recruiting in Europe, Australia, New Zealand and India. Essex County Council is already forced abroad by staffing gaps: it employs social workers from South Africa. Ernst &amp; Young is launching its first careers round in India next month. But Mr Howells warns that for Britain simply to import workers from overseas would mean that \"we have not convinced enough of our people there are viable careers here and they should retrain for them\". </p> <p>Tom Hadley, senior policy adviser and manager of the Employee Relocation Council at the CBI, says: \"We are keen to stress that bringing in foreign labour needs to be seen in conjunction with a number of other solutions. It is part of an on-going debate. But we see this as a positive thing. It is an advantage to get people from overseas: a lot of companies are operating in a global marketplace and it is an advantage to have multicultural teams.\" He adds that the international exchange of personnel is just that, an exchange, and that British companies are using overseas relocation as one of their development tools. </p> <p>But back to the US, and New York recruitment consultant Rohit Sawhney says there has been a dire shortage of IT experts in the US for two years. The government has relaxed quotas on its business visa, meaning that 190,000 immigrants are now allowed into the country to work compared with 65,000 previously. \"The situation has altered slightly, however. Whereas last year companies would just take on anyone, employers are now far more selective. This is because the website infrastructure is now in place and people are needed just to enhance it, which can wait. There is no longer a mad rush for staff,\" say Mr Sawhney. </p> <p>But he adds that the upshift in the number of immigrants allowed in the US has not had the anticipated effect in the major cities such as New York and New Jersey: large corporations are increasingly unwilling to go to the expense of relocating an IT expert from India or New Zealand who is under no contractual obligation to stay. </p> <p>Mr Hogarth says overseas recruiting will be just one way of plugging the gap. His company has also been forced to accept beefing up the quality of jobs offered to graduate employees, as well as taking on non-graduates into areas where a degree has, in the past, been a pre-requisite for working. \"To fill vacancies we're not frightened of paying. What does frighten us more is the number of vacancies unfilled. We have literally hundreds of vacancies - I would say that vacancies are up 25% on this time last year.\" Qualified accountants with experience, tax and corporate finance specialists are particularly in short supply. </p> <p>\"Now we're trying to broaden the net of people we can attract who may have relevant experience. We're also looking at the way we undertake audits. We're defining separate roles so we can now focus graduates on developing skills for their longer term career, whereas in the past they had to do some tedious stuff as well,\" he says. </p> <p><strong>Where it's hurting worst</strong></p> <p><strong> City</strong><br> </p> <p> \"There are skills shortages across the board in the City, whether you are looking for professional accountants, bankers or legal personnel,\" says Alison Smith, director of recruitment consultants Badenoch &amp; Clark. The situation is a vicious circle: increasingly people are rejecting the City's long working hours, which means employers demanding more of their staff as they cannot find enough people to do the work. \"But if firms were more willing to train those with potential or retrain those with redundant skills, flexible working practices have more chance of happening,\" she says. </p> <p><strong> IT</strong><br> </p> <p> Recruitment consultants Computer People say the most sought-after IT experts are people with Java, C++, telecoms and Wap knowledge. High-level database skills such as Unix and Linux are also much in demand. \"The increased demand for Java skills does not seem to be abating, but companies are now being more realistic about the availability of such people and are prepared to look at candidates with OO and procedural programming skills. Graduates with OO skills are finding it easier to get first-time work and training on the job,\" says a spokeswoman. The average hourly rate for a Java developer in London is \u00a370, but can be as high as \u00a390 with experience in some sectors. </p> <p><strong> Charities</strong><br> </p> <p> While higher salaries in the sector, plus growing interest in jobs which benefit the community or environment, should mean a glut of candidates, charities are experiencing \"severe recruitment difficulties\", according to the Voluntary Sector National Training Council in England. \"There have been particular problems with charities in London and the south-east, where applications for jobs have declined severely in the last six to nine months. Charities are being forced to be far more lateral in the way in which they look for staff: they will take on people with sales experience to work in fundraising,\" says a spokesman. </p> <p><strong> Hospitality</strong><br> </p> <p> \"The hospitality and tourism industry is the fastest-growing job sector in the world,\" according to Anne Walker, managing director of Springboard UK, an independent organisation promoting career opportunities in the leisure industry. \"There are skills shortages at almost all levels and with every category of staff. There are currently 30,000 vacancies for chefs in this country: one of the problems is that cooking is not on the national curriculum.\" </p> <p><strong> Media</strong><br> </p> <p> John Foscolo, tutor at the Cardiff Centre for Journalism Studies, says there are more jobs on weekly papers than at any time in his eight years in teaching. \"I've never seen anything like it. There are far more jobs than students to fill them. It's because so many have been going into dot.coms because they pay so much better than weekly papers. On daily papers the jobs market is pretty good too as people are moving round so much. You've got to be trained, though. Papers want to put you straight to work. In PR there are so many jobs you can name your price.\" </p> <p><strong> Teaching</strong><br> </p> <p> Education secretary David Blunkett last year admitted that had salaries of \u00a36,000 not been introduced for teachers in training the situation would have been \"very close to meltdown\".Stories of schools cancelling classes because of staff shortages are increasingly common. Areas with shortfalls are London and the south-east in maths, technology, science and foreign languages: trainees in these areas now receive a golden hello of \u00a34,000. </p> <p><strong> Occupational therapy</strong><br> </p> <p> \"We have noticed a huge increase in the number of posts for occupational therapists advertised in our publications and we know there are not enough to deliver the service users need. We believe that nationwide the shortage is running at 20%,\" says Sheelagh Richards, chief executive of the College of Occupational Therapists. An Audit Commission report published last June showed that the gravest shortages were at the most senior level. According to NHS figures, the highest vacancy rates are in London, followed by the east, then the west midlands. </p> <p><strong> Social work</strong><br> </p> <p> According to an Employers' Organisation survey published in April 2000, there was a 16% vacancy rate nationally for social workers, rising to almost 20% in London, the south east and east Anglia - that is, one in five positions was unfilled. According to a spokesman for the organisation, there is no evidence that this has changed in the nine months since, but the problem had doubled in severity in the 18 months since the previous survey. In London and the home counties there are now around 500 vacancies for field social workers.</p>",

After the pharmacist has approved the sale, women will either order an express delivery or go to their nearest chemist to pick up the pill. Barry Simner, head pharmacist at superdrug.com, said: \"We can help people with their planned contraception methods and the availability of Levonelle allows us to help people who need emergency contraception.\" Juliet Hillier, of the Family Planning Association, said: \"If a pharmacist calls you back to discuss your order, it's not an anonymous service open to abuse. It looks like a very innovative approach to ensure that women have access to emergency contraception.\" Ann Furedi, of the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, said: \"We think it is a great initiative and welcome it hugely.\"",

India was a little later getting up than usual - the country was celebrating Republic Day. </p> <p>And then the building started to sway. \"I could see the glasses shaking. I was absolutely clear there was an earthquake. I grabbed my five-year-old son and managed to get out into the courtyard in 25 seconds,\" he said. </p> <p>Fifteen seconds later, the Sidhi apartments collapsed. There was a silence, followed by screaming. \"People were asking each other 'Are you all right? Are you all right?'\" </p> <p>But not everyone was all right. By last night the death toll in India's worst earthquake in 50 years was put at 2,000 and rising. More than 3,200 people have been injured. </p> <p>The quake in the western state of Gujarat, measuring 7.9 on the Richter scale, could be felt as far away as the capital Delhi, in the Himalayas and in tropical Madras. </p> <p>The two worst affected areas were the ancient walled city of Bhuj, 12 miles from the epicentre, where 150 people died when a single four-storey building collapsed, and the city of Ahmedabad. </p> <p>But even in Ahmedabad the earthquake was selectively destructive; some 40 buildings had collapsed but the rest of the city was intact. The victims had been unlucky - or slow. </p> <p>At Chandrama Flats, the fire brigade, armed with nothing more sophisticated than metal buckets, were last night excavating what had been the second floor of the apartment block. A boy's leg protruded from a ceiling, while two old women whose bodies could not be freed lay where the earthquake had caught them, in their beds. </p> <p>Rescuers were trying to reach Asish Shah, 21, who was still alive in the rubble. \"His brother Jiggar survived the initial quake but died a couple of hours later. We could not free him,\" Officer Dewang Lakhia said. \"There were 16 families living here. There are still at least 20 people we cannot locate. They are under four storeys of debris.\" </p> <p>It is clear that the authorities were catastrophically unprepared for the earthquake, even though tremors had been reported over the past week. Gujarat has suffered severe earthquakes in the past, including one in 1819 in which tens of thousands died. </p> <p>Hundreds of people besieged the fire station yesterday asking for help to dig out their relatives, according to the Ahmedabad fire chief, Rajesh Bhat. \"This is an emergency. We are facing a riotous crowd. A fear psychosis is developing in the city. People have fled their homes and are taking refuge in open fields.\" </p> <p>But in most areas volunteers were pulling away masonry by hand, surrounded by a sea of household objects. </p> <p>Over at Ahmedabad's main hospital, more than 500 patients arrived in the five hours after the earthquake struck. </p> <p>\"This is my worst day in seven years here,\" Kaushal Anand, the casualty doctor on duty, said. \"There are 120 dead here alone. Most of the injuries are bone injuries or head injuries. I was on the ward when the earthquake struck. I ran away. The patients already here ran away.\" </p> <p>In the hospital courtyard, those with nowhere to sleep were being served chapatis and rice. </p> <p>As darkness fell, families camped out on pavements and in public parks, afraid to return to buildings as 13 aftershocks rocked the state. More are expected throughout the week. </p> <p>In Delhi, the prime minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, called an emergency cabinet meeting to discuss the crisis while relief teams were airlifted by helicopter to the worst-affected areas near Bhuj. He asked \"all people to rally together at this time of national calamity\". </p> <p>The extent of the death toll is not likely to become clear until later today: much of the devastation has been in Kutch, the westernmost part of Gujarat - an isolated, sparsely populated expanse of salt flats. </p> <p>\"We expect unimaginable damage at the epicentre,\" SK Srivastav, a senior meteorologist and quake expert, said. \"All buildings, including strong buildings, will suffer damage in the epicentre area and all weak buildings will most likely to collapse.\" </p> <p>In Ahmedabad, electricity was restored yesterday afternoon but across much of the state phone and power lines were down. Across the state as a whole, 100 buildings were destroyed with the heaviest damage within a 125-mile radius of the epicentre. </p> <p>Across the border in Pakistan at least two people were killed in the city of Hyderabad. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Asian communities in Britain last night faced an agonising wait to hear whether relatives were safe, as the disaster slowed the flow of personal news to a trickle. Gujarat is home to the extended families of many British Indians. </p> <p>Prayers were offered in temples yesterday and community leaders pledged to raise funds for earthquake victims. </p> <p>The Foreign Office issued a helpline number for relatives which was quickly swamped by inquiries, forcing officials to set up a replacement line by 11am yesterday. </p> <p>A Foreign Office spokeswoman said last night that no British fatalities had been reported but callers are being asked to leave their contact details in case bad news came through from the region. </p> <p>Nilesh Shukla, from the Federation of Hindu Priests, said they were preparing to offer prayers for the families of those affected by the earthquake. \"I am sure there are a very large number of people who want to know what is happening and also to know what the number of people killed actually is.\" </p> <p>More than 500 members of Leicester's Gujarat Hindu Association were due to meet at 7pm last night at the Belgrave Neighbourhood Centre to celebrate Republic Day, which marks the 51st anniversary of the adoption of the Indian constitution.

      "body": "<p>Visitors to the Galapagos Islands could be forgiven for asking what all the fuss was about. Disaster workers and ecologists may outnumber tourists, but there are few visible signs of a disaster; the wrecked oil tanker, stranded on rocks a mile offshore, is blotting the tropical landscape rather than destroying it. </p> <p>\"We were very, very lucky,\" says Carlos Valle, regional director of the environment organisation WWF, and part of the army of international environmentalists that has descended on the archipelago after last week's oil spill from the ship. </p> <p>Simply keeping catastrophe at bay was never going to satisfy an environmental movement that wants the Galapagos Islands to remain as they were when Charles Darwin visited in 1839, particularly since most of the credit for the narrow escape is thanks to the winds and currents that carried the spill out to sea. </p> <p>About a third of the islands' 600 or so native plant species are found only there. Of the 57 species of reptiles, land birds and mammals, more than 80% are found nowhere else. Among these is the world's only marine lizard, the only species of penguin and albatross found in the tropics, and a cormorant that has lived so long without predators that it has lost the ability to fly. All are uniquely vulnerable, hence the unique concern. </p> <p>The Galapagos Islands were declared a national park in 1959, and developed an apparently model ecotourism industry - groups are sent island hopping to designated sites and always with a guide. </p> <p>The local conservationists appeared confident at the helm, and the international environmental groups were pleased to have one less place to worry about. That was until the rusting Jessica ran aground on January 16, and, three days later, began leaking its cargo of 885,700 litres (234,000 gallons) of diesel and bunker fuel. </p> <p>The oil-spill woke people to the realisation that the Galapagos was far from secure.

      "bodyText": "Visitors to the Galapagos Islands could be forgiven for asking what all the fuss was about. Disaster workers and ecologists may outnumber tourists, but there are few visible signs of a disaster; the wrecked oil tanker, stranded on rocks a mile offshore, is blotting the tropical landscape rather than destroying it. \"We were very, very lucky,\" says Carlos Valle, regional director of the environment organisation WWF, and part of the army of international environmentalists that has descended on the archipelago after last week's oil spill from the ship. Simply keeping catastrophe at bay was never going to satisfy an environmental movement that wants the Galapagos Islands to remain as they were when Charles Darwin visited in 1839, particularly since most of the credit for the narrow escape is thanks to the winds and currents that carried the spill out to sea. About a third of the islands' 600 or so native plant species are found only there. Of the 57 species of reptiles, land birds and mammals, more than 80% are found nowhere else. Among these is the world's only marine lizard, the only species of penguin and albatross found in the tropics, and a cormorant that has lived so long without predators that it has lost the ability to fly. All are uniquely vulnerable, hence the unique concern. The Galapagos Islands were declared a national park in 1959, and developed an apparently model ecotourism industry - groups are sent island hopping to designated sites and always with a guide. The local conservationists appeared confident at the helm, and the international environmental groups were pleased to have one less place to worry about. That was until the rusting Jessica ran aground on January 16, and, three days later, began leaking its cargo of 885,700 litres (234,000 gallons) of diesel and bunker fuel. The oil-spill woke people to the realisation that the Galapagos was far from secure. The question is how to prevent a future disaster. Some want to create a rapid reaction team ready to contain any emergency. But maintaining such a force would be expensive and the Ecuadorean government in Quito is already smarting at the estimated \u00a3350,000 bill owed to the US coast guard for services rendered. When this particular crisis is over, a request for international aid will certainly be made. Others issues, such as fishing rights, could rattle the uneasy peace between science, tourism and the locals. Increasingly strict quotas on fishing attest to the power of the conservationists, but clandestine catches of lobster, sea cucumbers and shark fins, much prized in Japan, show that victory is far from complete. \"What future?\" ask graffiti scrawled by fishermen. \"Our patrimony massacred,\" they continue, asserting people's right to fish freely, challenging the claim that the Galapagos belongs to the world. Sitting on his porch surrounded by nets, Washington Escaraby is bitter about the constraints on his traditional fishing habits. \"If there aren't any other jobs how can they expect us not to fish?\" He is also angry because the spill has kept him on dry land all week. A spill, he points out, caused by a ship delivering fuel for tourist boats. While this raises the possibility of banning such deliveries, conservationists generally favour tourism to fishing, and would like the fishermen to switch roles. But there is a problem, says Bishop Manuel Balarezo: until the big tour operators on mainland Ecuador relinquish control of the industry, the benefits for locals will be small. \"Often the people don't even get off the boat. They eat, sleep, and even buy their souvenirs right on board,\" the bishop says. The islands, 600 miles off the coast of Ecuador, were uninhabited when Darwin spent five weeks here.

      "body": "<p>You must forgive me for mentioning Auberon Waugh, but he was my friend, and I want to be sure that he gets into the Guinness Book of Records as the journalist whose death has generated more column inches in the British press than any other. Journalists tend to get longer obituaries and gushier tributes than they probably deserve, but the coverage devoted to Bron Waugh since his death last week has been truly extraordinary. Even the Guardian, a newspaper he didn't like and claimed not to read, devoted three pages to him the day after he died. And these were hardly less admiring than the five pages in the Daily Telegraph, the newspaper he felt closest to and for which he had been writing for some 30 years. </p> <p>No wonder Polly Toynbee felt outraged. She and Bron had for ages been slugging it out in print, each convinced that the other was some kind of monster. That her own, dear Guardian could join in the general kowtowing to her mortal enemy was perhaps more than she could bear. In any event, the next day she burst out on the Comment page with a fierce onslaught against the departed Waugh and his \"coterie of reactionary fogeys centred on the Spectator and the Telegraph\" (a coterie that, by implication, includes me, since I was for eight years Bron's editor at the Spectator). This, in turn, generated a spate of anti-Toynbee comment, some of which - like Keith Waterhouse's column in last Monday's Daily Mail - gave her at least as good as she had given Bron in terms of invective. </p> <p>Waterhouse's argument was basically that journalists exist to throw bottles at those in authority over us, not to cosy up to them. Toynbee's argument was that Waugh and his \"coterie\" did \"mighty damage to British political life, journalism, and discourse in the postwar years\" by \"spitting poison at anyone vulgar enough to want to improve anything at all\". </p> <p>She was quite wrong about some things. Waugh had many fans and admirers, as well as a few enemies, but he was not a member of a \"coterie\" of \"effete, drunken, snobbish, racist and sexist\" fogeys. His was a unique and unpredictable voice, and he was never part of a gang. He would have been flattered by her belief that he had done \"mighty damage\", for he was always doubtful about the ability of journalists to influence anything at all. In any case, what damage does she think he did? Political life, journalism and discourse have continued in this country much as before. All Waugh has done is to puncture a few balloons and expose prejudice, hypocrisy and stupidity whenever the opportunity has presented itself, and this strikes me as a positive contribution to make to British political life, journalism, etc. He has hurt people in the process, which is another matter and may not be nice, but why should Toynbee seek to criticise anybody for being \"witty\" and \"clever\". </p> <p>Waugh, of course, had his own prejudices, just as Toynbee has hers. But they were conservative prejudices, which is what makes them unacceptable to her. It is true, as she said, that he did not generally want \"to improve anything at all\" and opposed most forms of progress. But is every journalist in the world required to be a radical and an activist? Is there no room for the journalist who basically abhors change? Of course there is, so long as we still believe in democracy. What Toynbee apparently fails to understand is that there is room in journalism for both Waugh and herself. There are as many kinds of journalist as there are kinds of people - some serious, some frivolous; some committed, some detached. Art critics, book reviewers, science writers, gossip columnists, diplomatic correspondents, crime reporters, political pundits, fashion writers, humorists: these are all journalists with a place in the great scheme of things. </p> <p> As Harold Evans, who wrote for the Guardian from New York during the American election, once said during a debate about the influence of British journalism in the US, there is much greater diversity in the British than in the American press. \"The British press ranges from the worst examples you could possibly imagine in the world of the printed word being abused, to relatively high degrees of sainthood,\" he said. </p> <p>But where does \"sainthood\" lie? You could think it is with Toynbee, if you wish to change the world and agree with her ways of wanting to do it. But you could equally well have thought it was with Waugh, if you agreed with him that most change was likely to be for the worse and ought to be stopped. The point is, it doesn't matter. The British press, for all its defects, still offers a rich choice. You decide.</p>",

The girl group may or may not currently exist, of course, after one spat too many over whether Shaz or Nat got to wear the gold combat jacket, but even this is cool. Unlike the Spice Girls Mk II and their endless, depressing show of Friends Foreverish phoniness, the All Saints reflect the awful but unremarkable truth that people who work together for any length of time come to get on each other's nerves something awful. They are a refreshing refutation of that disgusting \"We work together, we play together, and work's just like play because we're all such good mates!\" ethos that has seen such a comeback in recent years with the Natural Nylon mob, the Richard Curtis Notting Hill set and Blair's stinking cackle of cronies. </p> <p>Furthermore, I love the way the Saints were presented as a \"natural\", organic alternative to the Spices, when, of course, they are nothing of the sort. If you see photos of Baby or Scary when they were unknown, they look more or less the same, give or take a Versace jacket and a decent haircut. But when you see a photograph of the young Natalie Appleton - to my mind, literally the most beautiful woman in the world today - there is absolutely no point of connection whatsoever with the current appearance. She looks as much like a whole other person as does a supergrass who's been sent off to have a new face put on before he lives out his days incognito in Spain. That's so much more cool, I reckon, than the timid little habit of having a bit of cowardly tweaking here and there, and hoping that it looks \"real\". </p> <p>So, the point is that I would basically forgive the All Saints anything. Anything, that is, except their latest single, All Hooked Up. Ooo! Ouch! I'm talking real-time minor-league trauma here. Because, over and over again, some old Saint keeps singing (and you should, gentle English reader, forgive the expression), \"I know that you want a piece of my ass.\" Oh me! Oh my! as Craig David would say. </p> <p>I'm by no means a prude, but I find this little toe-tapper only slightly less perturbing than the legendary Je T'Aime duet between Serge Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, during which a decent young Englishwoman tried to explain how she could possibly ever feel one iota of sexual attraction towards a Frog twice her age who regularly beat her up and made records about how much he wanted to have sex with his daughter. </p> <p>\"I know that you want a piece of my ass.\" Missus! Surely it's not only me who, against all odds, draws back, puts on a Kenneth Williams whine and shrieks, \"Oooo! Not even with two saveloys and a portion of mushy peas, luv!\" If it was Mary J Blige, we wouldn't turn a hair, but the fact that All Saints are English, and attempting to communicate in a minority American vernacular, should strike anyone with the least bit of feeling for the fitness of things as extremely amusing and grotesque. </p> <p>All Saints habitually sing with American accents, of course, an occurrence so common in English popular music that it's barely worth commenting on. However, I don't quite understand why Ali G is obviously funny while, say, Scots Londoner Rod Stewart pretending to be a dead old black man isn't. Age hasn't withered the habit, either. Anyone addicted to the fantastic PopStars programme will have noticed that, while the hopeful youngsters speak in the broadest Scots, Irish and northern English accents imaginable, when they begin to sing they all sound like the same confused, yowling moose. That is, they all sound American. </p> <p>Now, all sensible people will readily admit that to be an American is an essentially hellish and moronic state to which no one in their right mind would aspire. To be born British, especially, and aspire to this low condition would seem rather like throwing a platinum bracelet back in the face of an admirer and demanding a Perspex bangle instead. Only two types of people move there: the morally bankrupt, such as Amis and Rushdie; and the monumentally dim, such as Vinnie Jones, who hope with good reason that their stupidy will pass for normal in such a sea of dunces. Why, then, when it comes to crooning, does every damned warbler - with the odd exception such as Bryan Ferry and Steven Morrissey - aspire to having been born on the other side of the pond? And often, the most apparently anti-American and intelligent singers, such as Elvis Costello, are the most blatant offenders. </p> <p>The obvious answer is that rock'n'roll was born in the US and therefore it's a sort of living homage. But that's obviously not true of, say, the chanson, which is, of course, French in origin. But if an English singer stood up and performed a chanson in a French accent, he'd get bottled off. It would seem like he was making fun of French people - a noble occupation, admittedly, but there's a time and a place for everything. </p> <p>No, the reason why American is the natural language of pop is that the character of its people - babyish, petulant, shallow - is echoed so resonantly in the I-want-I-need-I'm-gonna-scream-and-scream-until-I'm-sick ethos of pop itself. With her typical tin-ear, Madonna is reported to be taking English lessons. It'll never catch on. </p> <p> I was happy to see that the very clever writer Lorna Sage, who died recently, named her only child Sharon. And also that my favourite ever EastEnders character, Sharon Watts, is about to return. Sharon is a beautiful name; as is Tracey, as is Debbie. Sharon, Tracey, Debbie, Julie - silky, sinuous, mellifluous. And quite beyond the pale, taste-wise. There are many irritating things about the Daily Mail, but surely a contender for most irritating item is Keith Waterhouse's recurrent Sharon and Tracey column, in which two monumentally thick working-class shopgirls demonstrate that they have the IQ of a sock. From time to time, highly-qualified young Sharons and Traceys write in to the paper and request that Waterhouse desists. But the tired old routine drags on and on. </p> <p>Can we imagine Waterhouse being allowed regularly to spoof two stupid, idle West Indians or Irishmen in his column, even in the Daily Mail? Of course not. And talk about pots and kettles. Isn't \"Keith\" a bit of a joke name itself? But then, no old Fleet Street geezer ever finds himself ridiculous. \"Wayne\" will always sound funnier than \"Auberon\" to them. </p> <p>I'll never forget the delightful spectacle of Hunter Davies trying to humiliate the boy pop star Marilyn and having the tables roundly turned on him. \"What kind of name is Marilyn?\" he sneered unpleasantly. </p> <p>\"I don't know, Hunter,\" came back the response. \"What kind of name is Hunter?\"</p>",

I was happy to see that the very clever writer Lorna Sage, who died recently, named her only child Sharon. And also that my favourite ever EastEnders character, Sharon Watts, is about to return. Sharon is a beautiful name; as is Tracey, as is Debbie. Sharon, Tracey, Debbie, Julie - silky, sinuous, mellifluous. And quite beyond the pale, taste-wise. There are many irritating things about the Daily Mail, but surely a contender for most irritating item is Keith Waterhouse's recurrent Sharon and Tracey column, in which two monumentally thick working-class shopgirls demonstrate that they have the IQ of a sock. From time to time, highly-qualified young Sharons and Traceys write in to the paper and request that Waterhouse desists. But the tired old routine drags on and on. Can we imagine Waterhouse being allowed regularly to spoof two stupid, idle West Indians or Irishmen in his column, even in the Daily Mail? Of course not. And talk about pots and kettles. Isn't \"Keith\" a bit of a joke name itself? But then, no old Fleet Street geezer ever finds himself ridiculous. \"Wayne\" will always sound funnier than \"Auberon\" to them. I'll never forget the delightful spectacle of Hunter Davies trying to humiliate the boy pop star Marilyn and having the tables roundly turned on him. \"What kind of name is Marilyn?\" he sneered unpleasantly. \"I don't know, Hunter,\" came back the response. \"What kind of name is Hunter?\"",

      "body": "<p>I remember... or else perhaps there is something which makes me remember, something which runs through my being, leaving behind its smell, or something which was hiding, sheltering in old letters, just waiting to be reawakened by some sly little word. It's a kind of trap, one of a number of things that can make us stumble. Something emerges from this background world, something to which we can at once put a name. Mute objects come to meet us, things that had been lying dormant around us for years - or so we thought - reveal their secrets. It can be a bit of a nuisance! There are dreams as well, dreams in which we fail to recognise ourselves, which we cannot grasp, but which demand to be interpreted and constantly reinterpreted. </p> <p>Even when we are travelling through places that we have left behind, places which have been destroyed or lost, which sound unfamiliar or have names that are new, even then we may suddenly be seized by a memory. That is what happened to me in the spring of 1958 when I visited the city of Gdansk for the first time since the war, as it slowly emerged from its heaps of rubble, and I hoped that here and there I might come across some surviving trace of what Danzig had once been. </p> <p>Sure enough, the schools were still where they had been, and that characteristic school smell still infested the corridors. But the journey to school seemed shorter than I remembered it. Then I set off to find Br\u00f6sen, which used to be a fishing village, and I found that the Baltic lapped against it as gently as it ever had. Suddenly I was standing outside the closed bathing station, beside the entrance next to the kiosk, likewise chained and padlocked. And all in a moment I could feel once more the thrill of one of the modest pleasures of my childhood: lemonade crystals tasting of strawberry, lemon and lily of the valley; you could buy them in sachets in the kiosk for a few pfennigs. But the minute this refreshing drink began to sparkle in my memory, it began to stir up stories, deceitful stories, which had been waiting, needing only a single word of recognition to bring them to the surface. This simple, innocuous lemonade powder, meant to be dissolved in water, set off a chain reaction in my brain: that first trembling love, that sparkle, repeated over and over, but never experienced. </p> <p>A recollection, no matter how deeply buried or fragmentary it may be, is more than just a matter of forcing your memory to work with precision. A recollection is allowed to cheat, to embellish or to pretend, whereas the memory is happy to be seen as a scrupulously trustworthy accountant. However, we know that powers of memory diminish with age, whereas recollections of all that had long been buried, recollections of childhood, now seem to come closer and often cluster around moments of happiness. </p> <p>Although I'm still fond of going out to look for mushrooms, even today I am taken unawares by the sudden memory of a moment when, as I child, I used to go off into the Kaszubska forest and suddenly came across a single cep. It was bigger and a more magnificent specimen than any that I have found since, and so I keep looking. Recollection provides me with the measure of what to look for. </p> <p>When it comes to recollection, the writer is a past master. Since narrative is what he writes, he has been trained in the craft. He knows that recollection is like a cat that has to be stroked - sometimes in the wrong direction - until it starts to tremble, and then to purr. This is how he uses his own recollections and, when needed, the recollections of people whom he invents as fancy takes him. Recollection is his quarry, his compost heap, his archive. He nurtures it as carefully as if it were a second crop. </p> <p>Of course he is aware that literature is a greedy beast, prepared to gulp down even newspaper articles and reports before they are at all ripe, before they have been licked into shape; but when the lean years come, chewed-over recollections are his staple diet, he recalls memories that have already been raked over once. Perhaps it goes with the job, this ability to turn painful or shameful moments or even the memory of some past failure into something that has entertainment value. </p> <p>That is why my lost homeland is something that forces recollection upon me, imposes an obligation to write out of obsession. That homeland, lost for ever, which has left a void that cannot be filled by a substitute, by some ersatz homeland or other, had to be recalled once more and then exorcised, banished on to paper, sheet after sheet and, though shattered, it had to find its reflection in a shard from a broken mirror. The recollection had to be drawn off in a way so carefully measured as to keep a narrator supplied with great cupfuls of it, quenching his thirst for his former self, allowing him to use his own particular perspective to see as great that which was small, to see as small that which was great. Every sluice gate is opened. The tramlines of Danzig, the cinemas in the old town and in the working-class districts. </p> <p>In recollection, the image of that Kashubian uncle seems quite different. He was a man who, at the beginning of the war, had been reluctant to be declared a hero for his defence of the Polish post office. When he died, the family said nothing. There was only chatter about blockades, special communiques, continual victories, banal, everyday events drawn out endlessly, and all that remained of these were scraps of words that hung in the air. </p> <p> There was the language: a patois that would die out a few decades after the end of the war with the oldest of the refugees, a Plattdeutsch that would be pushed further and further back into east and west Prussia. The Kashubian version of it I heard when my family spoke German has remained in my memory down to the finest detail. I remember, for example, what an aunt whispered in my ear in 1958, something that loses in the translation into standard German: \" Ech waiss, Ginterchen, em Wasten is basser, aber em Osten is scheener (G\u00fcnter, love, I know the west is better, but the east is more beautiful).\" This carefully balanced summing-up has not only stuck in my memory but, what is much more, it still runs through my books, weighing up the east and the west, and still today gives me a perspective on them. </p> <p>That's enough of \"professional recollection\", the phrase that sums up the writer's obsession. But there is also such a thing as collective memory. Throughout Europe it serves as a pretext: you either strive to evoke it or refrain from doing so. Wars and war crimes are laid at its door. There are entire ideological frameworks that it cannot shake off. This is particularly true of the still painful collective memory of the previous generation. </p> <p>Perhaps that is why we Germans had the idea of coining a neologism as hackneyed as \"the duty of remembrance\". It is required as \"admission of responsibility\" and rejected as insulting, and this is all done conscientiously: for decades now, for as long as the past has constantly caught up with us, it has been carried out as if it were a duty, since the 1960s, even by what was then the younger generation, the one which we used to term \"uncompromised\". It is as if children and grandchildren wanted to do the remembering in place of their parents and grandparents, who remain silent. Not a week passes that we are not warned about the dangers of forgetting. Once we have sufficiently fulfilled expectations by remembering the Jews who were persecuted, forced to emigrate, murdered in immeasurably large numbers, as an afterthought we remember the murder of 10,000 Gypsies. And now, too late according to many, we are forced to remember what happened to thousands of forced labourers who came from Poland, from the Soviet Union and many other countries to take their places on the production lines in factories working for the German war effort. </p> <p>It is as if the crimes carried out over a period of just 12 years take on more and more weight the further we move in time from deeds which all the world recognises as shameful. Attempts to give concrete form to recollection by means of memorials seem doomed to failure. In Berlin, for example, conflict broke out, and it was not only matters of aesthetics that loomed large. \"Remember!\" cried one side; \"Enough!\" the other side shouted back. It happens that foreigners, observing the Germans' dealings with their past, speak of \"self- flagellation\", which makes the point that a process of recollection is a torture. But there is really no end in sight. Whenever we make our plans for the future, the past has left its mark on what we thought was virgin territory; it has set up signposts that just lead us back to what we have already lived through. </p> <p>It is strange and disturbing to hear it said that it is only ever late in the day and with much hesitation that the sufferings inflicted on the Germans during the war are recalled. The consequences of the war, begun without scruple by Germany and criminally pursued, that is, the destruction of German towns, the deaths of thousands of civilians as a result of bombing, the expulsion and distress of the 12m Germans in the east who had to flee: all this was only ever mentioned as a background. In postwar literature, the memory of the many who died in the nights of bombing and the mass exodus was never reflected in the same way. Experience shows that victims of violence, whoever was responsible for it, do not wish to remember the atrocities they have undergone. </p> <p>And so many things remain unsaid, even when they keep forcing themselves into our consciousness like painful memories. Since there never really was a peace, since, in the Balkans, in the Caucasus, in so many theatres of horror around the world, the present is given over to murder, to evacuation and deportation, then recollection, the echo of the sufferings we have lived through will never cease. </p> <p> Recently, the Hungarian writer Gy\u00f6rgy Konrad wrote about Europe: \"To remember is human, we could even say that it is the essence of humanity.\" While nature treats history with indifference, it is, he insists, a specific human characteristic to be able to remember in two ways, as if this ability were both a benefit and a curse. It is a curse because it will not leave us in peace and a benefit because it overcomes death. Thus, in recollection, we may speak with both the living and the dead. As long as we are remembered, we live on. Forgetting puts the seal on death. </p> <p>\u0095 I Remember by G\u00aanter Grass is extracted from Index on Censorship, 1/01, Memory and Forgetting, on sale from February 6, price \u00a38.99.

A recollection is allowed to cheat, to embellish or to pretend, whereas the memory is happy to be seen as a scrupulously trustworthy accountant. However, we know that powers of memory diminish with age, whereas recollections of all that had long been buried, recollections of childhood, now seem to come closer and often cluster around moments of happiness. Although I'm still fond of going out to look for mushrooms, even today I am taken unawares by the sudden memory of a moment when, as I child, I used to go off into the Kaszubska forest and suddenly came across a single cep. It was bigger and a more magnificent specimen than any that I have found since, and so I keep looking. Recollection provides me with the measure of what to look for. When it comes to recollection, the writer is a past master. Since narrative is what he writes, he has been trained in the craft. He knows that recollection is like a cat that has to be stroked - sometimes in the wrong direction - until it starts to tremble, and then to purr. This is how he uses his own recollections and, when needed, the recollections of people whom he invents as fancy takes him. Recollection is his quarry, his compost heap, his archive. He nurtures it as carefully as if it were a second crop. Of course he is aware that literature is a greedy beast, prepared to gulp down even newspaper articles and reports before they are at all ripe, before they have been licked into shape; but when the lean years come, chewed-over recollections are his staple diet, he recalls memories that have already been raked over once. Perhaps it goes with the job, this ability to turn painful or shameful moments or even the memory of some past failure into something that has entertainment value. That is why my lost homeland is something that forces recollection upon me, imposes an obligation to write out of obsession. That homeland, lost for ever, which has left a void that cannot be filled by a substitute, by some ersatz homeland or other, had to be recalled once more and then exorcised, banished on to paper, sheet after sheet and, though shattered, it had to find its reflection in a shard from a broken mirror. The recollection had to be drawn off in a way so carefully measured as to keep a narrator supplied with great cupfuls of it, quenching his thirst for his former self, allowing him to use his own particular perspective to see as great that which was small, to see as small that which was great. Every sluice gate is opened. The tramlines of Danzig, the cinemas in the old town and in the working-class districts. In recollection, the image of that Kashubian uncle seems quite different. He was a man who, at the beginning of the war, had been reluctant to be declared a hero for his defence of the Polish post office. When he died, the family said nothing. There was only chatter about blockades, special communiques, continual victories, banal, everyday events drawn out endlessly, and all that remained of these were scraps of words that hung in the air. There was the language: a patois that would die out a few decades after the end of the war with the oldest of the refugees, a Plattdeutsch that would be pushed further and further back into east and west Prussia. The Kashubian version of it I heard when my family spoke German has remained in my memory down to the finest detail. I remember, for example, what an aunt whispered in my ear in 1958, something that loses in the translation into standard German: \" Ech waiss, Ginterchen, em Wasten is basser, aber em Osten is scheener (G\u00fcnter, love, I know the west is better, but the east is more beautiful).\" This carefully balanced summing-up has not only stuck in my memory but, what is much more, it still runs through my books, weighing up the east and the west, and still today gives me a perspective on them. That's enough of \"professional recollection\", the phrase that sums up the writer's obsession. But there is also such a thing as collective memory. Throughout Europe it serves as a pretext: you either strive to evoke it or refrain from doing so. Wars and war crimes are laid at its door. There are entire ideological frameworks that it cannot shake off. This is particularly true of the still painful collective memory of the previous generation. Perhaps that is why we Germans had the idea of coining a neologism as hackneyed as \"the duty of remembrance\". It is required as \"admission of responsibility\" and rejected as insulting, and this is all done conscientiously: for decades now, for as long as the past has constantly caught up with us, it has been carried out as if it were a duty, since the 1960s, even by what was then the younger generation, the one which we used to term \"uncompromised\". It is as if children and grandchildren wanted to do the remembering in place of their parents and grandparents, who remain silent. Not a week passes that we are not warned about the dangers of forgetting. Once we have sufficiently fulfilled expectations by remembering the Jews who were persecuted, forced to emigrate, murdered in immeasurably large numbers, as an afterthought we remember the murder of 10,000 Gypsies. And now, too late according to many, we are forced to remember what happened to thousands of forced labourers who came from Poland, from the Soviet Union and many other countries to take their places on the production lines in factories working for the German war effort. It is as if the crimes carried out over a period of just 12 years take on more and more weight the further we move in time from deeds which all the world recognises as shameful. Attempts to give concrete form to recollection by means of memorials seem doomed to failure. In Berlin, for example, conflict broke out, and it was not only matters of aesthetics that loomed large. \"Remember!\" cried one side; \"Enough!\" the other side shouted back. It happens that foreigners, observing the Germans' dealings with their past, speak of \"self- flagellation\", which makes the point that a process of recollection is a torture. But there is really no end in sight. Whenever we make our plans for the future, the past has left its mark on what we thought was virgin territory; it has set up signposts that just lead us back to what we have already lived through. It is strange and disturbing to hear it said that it is only ever late in the day and with much hesitation that the sufferings inflicted on the Germans during the war are recalled. The consequences of the war, begun without scruple by Germany and criminally pursued, that is, the destruction of German towns, the deaths of thousands of civilians as a result of bombing, the expulsion and distress of the 12m Germans in the east who had to flee: all this was only ever mentioned as a background. In postwar literature, the memory of the many who died in the nights of bombing and the mass exodus was never reflected in the same way. Experience shows that victims of violence, whoever was responsible for it, do not wish to remember the atrocities they have undergone. And so many things remain unsaid, even when they keep forcing themselves into our consciousness like painful memories. Since there never really was a peace, since, in the Balkans, in the Caucasus, in so many theatres of horror around the world, the present is given over to murder, to evacuation and deportation, then recollection, the echo of the sufferings we have lived through will never cease. Recently, the Hungarian writer Gy\u00f6rgy Konrad wrote about Europe: \"To remember is human, we could even say that it is the essence of humanity.\" While nature treats history with indifference, it is, he insists, a specific human characteristic to be able to remember in two ways, as if this ability were both a benefit and a curse. It is a curse because it will not leave us in peace and a benefit because it overcomes death. Thus, in recollection, we may speak with both the living and the dead. As long as we are remembered, we live on. Forgetting puts the seal on death. \u0095 I Remember by G\u00aanter Grass is extracted from Index on Censorship, 1/01, Memory and Forgetting, on sale from February 6, price \u00a38.99.

It went: \"The highways and byways of England are littered with the bones of little children.\" </p> <p>The chilling picture it evoked stuck in her mind, and was reinforced during a visit to Hebden Bridge, when she saw the decaying mills where children had been worked to death. She began to look into 18th-century England. \"I'm not a scholar, but everything I read confirmed my view. The mortality rates for children looked after by the parishes were shocking. The way babies were treated was horrific.

It is the dramatic, interwoven story of how two babies survive, thanks to the philanthropic work of Thomas Coram, founder of the Foundling Hospital. Their survival, which is largely a matter of luck, is in stark contrast to the dismal plight of most illegitimate babies at the time. Coram Boy reflects Gavin's contempt for a society riddled with corruption that held the lives of individuals cheap, whether children or adult, unless they had power. </p> <p>The 18th-century children Gavin describes are shown taking on physical and social responsibility well beyond the capabilities of their modern European counterparts. Gavin argues that she has seen children in India, and other third world countries, do as much. \"Very young children in India have to take on adult responsibilities, not just by earning but also in the domestic tasks they have to do. Exactly the same thing happened in the 18th century here.\" </p> <p>The parallels between India now and England as it was are of particular interest to Gavin, who was born in India in 1941 and spent the first five years of her life growing up on the border between India and Pakistan. </p> <p>Her English mother and Indian father had met as teachers working for the CMS, and her father went on to found and run a teachers' training college near Amritsar. By 1946 it became obvious that it was too dangerous to stay, so Gavin and her mother and brother came to England while her father stayed on, despite the risks, right through Partition. In 1949 the family was reunited in Poona, but by 1953 Gavin's mother had begun to worry about her children's education and the whole family moved to England for good. </p> <p>\"I never found it difficult to adjust to being in England because I had been brought up with entirely English Christian values,\" Gavin says. \"Inside, I thought of myself as English.

It went: \"The highways and byways of England are littered with the bones of little children.\" The chilling picture it evoked stuck in her mind, and was reinforced during a visit to Hebden Bridge, when she saw the decaying mills where children had been worked to death. She began to look into 18th-century England. \"I'm not a scholar, but everything I read confirmed my view. The mortality rates for children looked after by the parishes were shocking. The way babies were treated was horrific. They were totally neglected in a way that immediately made me think of the dying rooms of China.\" It was against this background that Gavin wrote Coram Boy, which this week won the Whitbread Children's Book prize.

      "body": "<p>In 1971 Hugh Brody was in the tiny settlement of Rankin Inlet in Canada's high Arctic zone, learning the local language, Inuktitut. The young anthropologist had been employed by the Canadian government to give policy advice on the indigenous people. A few weeks after arriving he was invited on a hunting trip by some local men. Brody found himself thrilled at, \"the small way I transformed the awesome, silent and immense 'wilderness' into bits of language and culture, things I knew or could imagine getting to know.\" But \"nemesis soon followed,\" as he puts it. </p> <p>After a brief and successful hunt for ptarmigan - \"the grouse of the north\" - Brody looked round to find himself utterly alone in a landscape, \"that repeated itself in every direction; flat, white, broken by many low ridges\". Although he knew that panic and haste were his enemies and that sweat would quickly degrade the insulation of his clothes, he still found himself dashing wildly from one small point of high ground to another looking for signs of his companions. </p> <p>After an hour or so he managed to regain some composure and eventually identified the tracks of a snowmobile, which he followed back to the camp. When he got there his fellow hunters hadn't even noticed he was missing and he was too embarrassed to tell them what had happened. \"I handed over the three ptarmigan, then went and lay down. I was filled by a mixture of relief and shame. I had everything to learn.\" </p> <p>Brody tells this story in his new book, The Other Side Of Eden: Hunter-Gatherers, Farmers And The Shaping Of The World. It is a summation of his 30 years experience of working with indigenous peoples and of the other elements in his extraordinarily varied career. The book is a tour de force of storytelling, as befits a writer of fiction as well as of anthropology. Its politics are sophisticated yet retain their passion. He stylishly exhibits a breadth of cultural awareness: he has written and directed films about Henry Moore and a feature film about Sigmund Freud's patients as well as six documentaries about Arctic peoples; he has been a civil servant, acted as an expert witness in complex land-claim legal cases and authored influential environmental reports. </p> <p>Anthony Smith, former director of the British Film Institute and now president of Magdalen College, Oxford, has known Brody and his work since the mid-70s. \"Hugh is perfectly academically respectable, but he isn't an academic anthropologist,\" says Smith. \"When he is wandering around the Arctic he is as much looking into his own society as he is the society of the people he is with. And he sees things in it that we can't. What Hugh is really interested in is directly confronting the fundamental question of what it entails to be alive.\" </p> <p>He attracts praise - although not as much as his friends and admirers say he deserves - from all points of the political spectrum. The conservative intellectual Roger Scruton describes Brody's new book as, \"extremely good and important for us to reflect on. Although hunter-gatherers have more or less been wiped out by various forms of colonisation, their experience is still embedded in our semi sub-conscious and we need to revisit it and understand it. I think a failure to do so is responsible for many of our modern ills.\" </p> <p>From the left, John Berger, who has collaborated with Brody on several film projects, is equally impressed and enthusiastic. \"I would recommend his book Maps And Dreams [about his work with the Dunne-za and Cree peoples of the eastern Rockies] to anyone, not just people interested in anthropology. Because Hugh takes such enormous time and care, his voice is from the inside of these people and, because he is an anthropologist, also from the outside. He is trusted enough to share their wonder. It allows him to be fully aware of both the positive and the tragic in their lives.\" </p> <p>In The Other Side Of Eden, Brody probes the historical, cultural, political and social relation ships between agricultural societies (categorised as potato-growers and comprising most of the rest of us) and hunter-gatherers - those who colonise and cultivate the land and those who live within its resources. With a foot in both camps he draws on a vast array of sources from local myths to the Bible, citing Genesis as, \"the key text that identifies the condition of farmers and explains aggressive, restless agriculture\". </p> <p>Ursula Owen, editor of Index on Censorship, has known Brody for nearly 30 years and says that his ability to operate successfully in more than one world is at the heart of him. \"He's from a Jewish family but was given a traditional English education, he loves both the Arctic and European intellectual life, he wants to be home with his family and away on his travels. These ambivalences and divisions can be quite hard on him, but he knows that resolution is no kind of answer. He never wants to short-circuit things and always wants the complexity. He knows he must operate within the splits.\" </p> <p>Brody acknowledges the high levels of diversity in his life. He was born in Sheffield in 1943 where his father - whose family had originated in the Ukraine where Brody is the name of a town - was a hospital doctor. His mother had come to Britain from Austria after the 1938 Anschluss and still lives in Sheffield. His parents met when his mother was assigned to his father's hospital to do nursing work. They got engaged three weeks later. </p> <p>Brody's maternal grandmother always lived with the family and he says his childhood benefited enormously from her determination that he would not be \"merely English\". He says she came from a well-connected family, was very central European in her attitudes and, \"thought England was a bleak rock in the Atlantic. And as for Sheffield...\" She spoke to Brody in French, taught him Latin and played chess with him. \"So I ended up having borscht and gefilte fish and goulash and being sent to Hebrew classes three times a week, but I also went to a Church of England school and my brother and I were both given very English Christian names. It was a double existence.\" </p> <p>Tony Brody is three years older than Hugh and, after an initial career as a nuclear physicist, is now a heart surgeon in Illinois. Hugh says there was always an unspoken bias towards achieving and contributing to society in the family. \"My father was rarely at home where we wanted him. He was always out doing good as a doctor. I'm sure that planted something in me about 'doing good' being what really mattered. I have to fight against that to spend more time with my own children.\" </p> <p>After attending Montessori nursery and then a C of E prep school - where Michael Palin was a fellow pupil - Brody was sent as a boarder to Uppingham public school in Rutland. \"It was a middle-class, middle-ranking school in the middle of England. I had my barmitzvah and then I prayed to a Christian god twice a day in chapel.\" He says his best friend at school was, coincidentally, also Jewish but they encountered little obvious anti-Semitism apart from having to take the roles of a pair of merchants with heavily exaggerated London Jewish accents in a school play. \"That probably was a little exercise in anti-semitism,\" he says now. \"People were probably more aware of it than I realised. But at the time I thought my brother encountered more because he looked more Jewish than me.\" </p> <p>Unsurprisingly the move from his liberal, intellectual, multi- lingual home to a very illiberal authoritarian, Anglican school wasn't easy. He left as soon he could and took a job in an accountants' office in Sheffield where he \"wore a suit and had a miserable life\". This drove him to return to education and he successfully sat the Oxford entrance exams. Before taking up his place he spent six months in Israel doing a series of manual jobs on a kibbutz. His father was a strong Zionist and Brody says he remembers having a \"surge of Zionist anxiety during the 1967 war. But after that I came to a more considered view of Israel which put an end to any simple-minded Zionism.\" </p> <p>The opening story in Brody's 1991 collection of fiction, Means Of Escape, features a woman not unlike his grandmother and deals with the destruction of her family during the holocaust. Is it too pat to say that his interest in and empathy with endangered peoples comes from this family history? \"It has been said that it is Highland Scots and Jews that have done most of the work on social theory going back to the 18th century because in their background is this huge displacement and dispossession,\" he says. \"In my case there is an echo.\" </p> <p>His grandmother had lived an ostensibly very comfortable and safe life in an assimilated Jewish family in Vienna. \"They thought they had nothing to fear,\" Brody says: \"As that great line has it, they thought they were Germans. The fact that my grandmother was not safe after all was a big thing for her. When I was a child, people from the Jewish community with tattoos would come to the house. My grandmother always made a point of showing them to me, but while I was alerted to the Holocaust I wasn't given the details.\" </p> <p>When he went up to Oxford to read PPE he says he felt, \"as if life had begun\". He also claims he was lucky to be there before the 60s really kicked in. \"Things were loosening up but we still took the work seriously and we were subservient enough to actually read our books and write our essays. If I had gone five years later I wouldn't have read my books or done my essays, but would have been involved in street activism or whatever. When I was there working hard was taken for granted.\" </p> <p>He was, nevertheless, socially concerned - committed to the peace movement and inspired by the CND Committee of 100. \"In my first term at Oxford I did a public fast with five other students over Christmas to publicise how much was spent per second on defence. We were outside all of Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and Boxing Day.\" </p> <p>He was quickly identified as someone to watch and was invited to meet Isaiah Berlin. \"There was a part of me at Oxford that was quite depressed, but there was another part that just gorged on it,\" he remembers. \"It can be a very lonely place, but intellectually it seemed there were things to be had. I was very reluctant to take my finals because I thought it might lead me to a path I couldn't get off. I painted and wrote a lot of fiction and wanted to pursue this side of my life, but all these people were saying 'join us', so in the end I convinced myself that that is what I wanted.\" </p> <p>After his degree he undertook research into social theory but soon moved to more practical work. \"I realised I didn't want to spend my life in libraries. I wanted to work with people. I also didn't want to hang on the coat-tails of great thinkers and I didn't want to write about what one person has written about another person.\" </p> <p>He got a job at Belfast University teaching social philosophy and began field work into rural communities in the west of Ireland. Six months later he quit the job and went to work full time on his writing and research. \"There was a feeling of coming home with the field work. I realised that the most interesting thing in the world is what people have to say. Listening to people is what I wanted to do.\" </p> <p>Out of this period came his first book, Inishkillane: Change And Decline In The West Of Ireland. While in Ireland he began a nine-year relationship with art student Christine Moore. She went on to become a student of Chinese, moved to China and now lives in Canada. In 1980 he met Miranda Tufnell, a dancer who is the mother of his first two children. His son Tomo is 17 and works as a volunteer in a home for children with epilepsy, and Jonah is 15 and at school. He and Tufnell were together for 10 years and after they broke up he lived alone and travelled a great deal - \"there is nothing like a broken relationship to throw you into field work\" - before he met the actress Juliet Stevenson at a dinner party in London in 1993. When Stevenson was profiled in these pages in 1998 she said, \"I walked into the room and my heart went boom. Something weird seemed to happen in my gut.\" </p> <p>After they met they didn't see each other for a couple of months because she was working in California. \"This was pre email,\" says Brody, \"so there were lots of letters and phone calls and faxes.\" The couple now live together in Highgate, north London, and have a six-year-old daughter, Rosalind, and a new baby son, Gabriel, born just before Christmas. \"The baby was a bit of a surprise,\" concedes Brody, \"and we did worry at first that we were too old, and would we have enough money. But we then realised what could be greater than spending time with a new baby?\" </p> <p>The former England cricket captain - now psychoanalyst - Mike Brearley is working with Brody on a film about psychoanalysis. He is struck by the different worlds Brody inhabits and the number of areas of thought he is interested in. \"And of course it is striking that he has small children and he goes off to the Arctic or Africa every now and again,\" adds Brearley. \"In a way one feels slightly envious that he can go off and live in a different world and understand it to a great degree. But it must be very unsettling for him and unsettling for the family.\" </p> <p>Brody agrees. \"So much of my work depends on travel. When the boys were young they did come on trips, and even in the last year my three older children have been to Africa with me. The greatest joy for me is to include them and the greatest pain is leaving the children. Missing them eats into my heart.\" </p> <p>As a result of his work in Ireland he decided he wanted to go to a colonial frontier and in 1969 made his first major trip to Canada. His first book from the region, Indians On Skid Row, about alcoholism and crime among Indian migrants in Edmonton, was published in 1971. That same year he was offered a post with the Canadian department for Indian and northern affairs, researching and advising on government policy. \"I went to the Arctic to see what the problems were and that was a timely thing to do. Problems had accumulated over the years and no-one had listened. People were very alarmed as to what was happening to their land, to their children, to their homes and to their culture.\" </p> <p>He went on to write The People's Land in 1975 before moving south to the eastern foothills of the Rockies, where his work preparing cultural and hunting maps with the Dunne-za and Cree was written up in his highly acclaimed Maps And Dreams in 1981. In 1987 he wrote the book Living Arctic to accompany an exhibition of the same name at the British Museum. </p> <p>His first film, The Eskimos Of Pond Inlet, made in 1975, was directed by the respected documentary maker Mike Grigsby for Granada's Disappearing World series. Brody has gone on to make a series of documentaries. \"I saw Mike Grigsby's film about fishermen in Fleetwood and it opened my eyes to what documentary film could do,\" he explains. He always works in collaboration with his subjects, and sometimes gives them powers of veto. He sees himself more as an ambassador than a journalist. \"I do try to be as true as possible to what people say they want.\" </p> <p>The writer Anthony Barnett, Brody's friend for over 30 years, says the self-effacing way Brody has worked in both film and in print makes it sometimes difficult to catch his voice: \"He has always tried to avoid the sterility of institutionalisation and always wants to allow for a knight's move to escape. But there's also an argument he wants to have, and it's now time for him to stand and argue his ground. One of the great things about this new book is that he is really beginning to speak as Hugh Brody.\" </p> <p>Brody says the three key issues facing indigenous peoples are land rights, the ramifications of abuse some of them suffered in residential schools and other government programmes over the last century, and the loss of language. \"Everywhere - in Australia, Africa, Canada or the US - you find people in individual and collective crises about language. It is a source of dismay and despair because what does it mean to live in an oral culture and lose your language? They want their account of the facts to be acknowledged, their place in history to be acknowledged and their losses to be acknowledged. Language is crucial for all these. When I was learning Inuktitut my teacher would say all the time, 'I'm not teaching you for fun. I want you to speak for us'.\" </p> <p>Brody says that learning native languages reverses the colonial relationship, as these peoples' experience of life had been shaped and embittered by always being regarded as ignorant. \"They didn't know English, how to use pots and pans, orderly time, how to give their children formula milk, cure their diseases, repair their guns, or 'the true religion'. Colonialism constitutes them as ignoramuses - vessels to be filled with the truth. But if you ask them to teach you their language you give them a chance to reverse this - you are the one who doesn't know anything. Instead of saying 'seal' you say 'penis' and they all laugh at you.\" </p> <p>It is partly through his facility for languages - he speaks French, German, Hebrew and two Inuktitut dialects - that he has been able to infiltrate so effectively the communities he has worked in. John Berger notes that he is also a \"fantastic storyteller. But unlike many people gifted with languages he doesn't feel obliged to talk; instead he listens a great deal. The relationships he is able to establish inspire confidence. People recognise that he is going to be dependable.\" </p> <p>Leslie Pinder is a Canadian lawyer and novelist who has worked on several landmark legal cases. She first met Brody in the mid 70s when, as an expert witness, he was called to explain how the indigenous people lived in a case concerning Indian land given to soldiers returning from the second world war which subsequently yielded substantial oil and gas revenues. She says he was an ideal witness. \"He's not always looking at notes or historical records but has an easy command of first-hand knowledge. And he's also such a good storyteller. The Crown assumed a lot of things about these people that was completely wrong. But Hugh took the judge and the whole court on a metaphorical hunting trip to explain how the people related to this land.\" </p> <p>Perhaps the most significant public project he was involved with was the massive Sardar Sarovan dam in western India. At the time it was the largest water project in the world and proposed raising a huge river by 145m so gravity could feed 75,000kms of canals to bring water to 30m people. But by 1988 it had become the most hotly contested environmental project in the world and the funder, the World Bank, was forced to hold an independent review. </p> <p>Brody was one of four experts the bank brought in to assess the complex issue of resettlement for those who would lose their lands and livelihoods from the proposed dam. He exploded the claim that \"only\" 70,000 people would be displaced - it would have been nearer to 400,000 - while making clear that irrigation was still needed. \"I was very moved by the desperate pleas for water,\" he says. \"We didn't say in our report that these people shouldn't get water. But we did say that there was a cost in that many others would lose their land, their resources and their livelihoods.\" </p> <p>The experts' core recommendation that the World Bank withdraw from the project was \"unequivocal and unexpected\", wrote Arundhati Roy, the Booker prizewinner, two years ago, in an account of the environmental and political battle. What their report revealed, she wrote, \"is scandalous\". Last October, after years of legal wrangling, India's Supreme Court ruled that construction of the dam should be completed as \"expeditiously\" as possible. </p> <p>Brody was brought to the project by the inquiry's vice-chair, the former Canadian judge, Thomas Berger, who had first encountered him in the mid-70s while chairing an inquiry into a proposed pipeline through the western arctic. Brody was an expert witness for the aboriginal people. \"We couldn't have done it without Hugh,\" Berger says of the World Bank report. \"He was absolutely invaluable and had a tremendous input. He is truly a renaissance man and a citizen of the world. He's an international treasure.\" </p> <p>A large part of Brody's work has revolved around getting to know exactly how people relate to their resources and mapping their relationships with the land. Since 1997 he has been visiting the southern Kalahari desert three to four times a year for up to six weeks, working with bushmen who have been displaced by large parks. But it is clear that more northern latitudes still entrance him. </p> <p>\"I felt deeply content in the Arctic,\" he says. \"While working on this book I thought much more directly about why I was so at ease with people who don't like schedules, who decide what they are going to do while they are doing it, who are in some sense disorganised although are of course highly organised underneath.

      "bodyText": "In 1971 Hugh Brody was in the tiny settlement of Rankin Inlet in Canada's high Arctic zone, learning the local language, Inuktitut. The young anthropologist had been employed by the Canadian government to give policy advice on the indigenous people. A few weeks after arriving he was invited on a hunting trip by some local men. Brody found himself thrilled at, \"the small way I transformed the awesome, silent and immense 'wilderness' into bits of language and culture, things I knew or could imagine getting to know.\" But \"nemesis soon followed,\" as he puts it. After a brief and successful hunt for ptarmigan - \"the grouse of the north\" - Brody looked round to find himself utterly alone in a landscape, \"that repeated itself in every direction; flat, white, broken by many low ridges\". Although he knew that panic and haste were his enemies and that sweat would quickly degrade the insulation of his clothes, he still found himself dashing wildly from one small point of high ground to another looking for signs of his companions. After an hour or so he managed to regain some composure and eventually identified the tracks of a snowmobile, which he followed back to the camp. When he got there his fellow hunters hadn't even noticed he was missing and he was too embarrassed to tell them what had happened. \"I handed over the three ptarmigan, then went and lay down. I was filled by a mixture of relief and shame. I had everything to learn.\" Brody tells this story in his new book, The Other Side Of Eden: Hunter-Gatherers, Farmers And The Shaping Of The World. It is a summation of his 30 years experience of working with indigenous peoples and of the other elements in his extraordinarily varied career. The book is a tour de force of storytelling, as befits a writer of fiction as well as of anthropology. Its politics are sophisticated yet retain their passion. He stylishly exhibits a breadth of cultural awareness: he has written and directed films about Henry Moore and a feature film about Sigmund Freud's patients as well as six documentaries about Arctic peoples; he has been a civil servant, acted as an expert witness in complex land-claim legal cases and authored influential environmental reports. Anthony Smith, former director of the British Film Institute and now president of Magdalen College, Oxford, has known Brody and his work since the mid-70s. \"Hugh is perfectly academically respectable, but he isn't an academic anthropologist,\" says Smith. \"When he is wandering around the Arctic he is as much looking into his own society as he is the society of the people he is with. And he sees things in it that we can't. What Hugh is really interested in is directly confronting the fundamental question of what it entails to be alive.\" He attracts praise - although not as much as his friends and admirers say he deserves - from all points of the political spectrum. The conservative intellectual Roger Scruton describes Brody's new book as, \"extremely good and important for us to reflect on. Although hunter-gatherers have more or less been wiped out by various forms of colonisation, their experience is still embedded in our semi sub-conscious and we need to revisit it and understand it. I think a failure to do so is responsible for many of our modern ills.\" From the left, John Berger, who has collaborated with Brody on several film projects, is equally impressed and enthusiastic. \"I would recommend his book Maps And Dreams [about his work with the Dunne-za and Cree peoples of the eastern Rockies] to anyone, not just people interested in anthropology. Because Hugh takes such enormous time and care, his voice is from the inside of these people and, because he is an anthropologist, also from the outside. He is trusted enough to share their wonder. It allows him to be fully aware of both the positive and the tragic in their lives.\" In The Other Side Of Eden, Brody probes the historical, cultural, political and social relation ships between agricultural societies (categorised as potato-growers and comprising most of the rest of us) and hunter-gatherers - those who colonise and cultivate the land and those who live within its resources. With a foot in both camps he draws on a vast array of sources from local myths to the Bible, citing Genesis as, \"the key text that identifies the condition of farmers and explains aggressive, restless agriculture\". Ursula Owen, editor of Index on Censorship, has known Brody for nearly 30 years and says that his ability to operate successfully in more than one world is at the heart of him. \"He's from a Jewish family but was given a traditional English education, he loves both the Arctic and European intellectual life, he wants to be home with his family and away on his travels. These ambivalences and divisions can be quite hard on him, but he knows that resolution is no kind of answer. He never wants to short-circuit things and always wants the complexity. He knows he must operate within the splits.\" Brody acknowledges the high levels of diversity in his life. He was born in Sheffield in 1943 where his father - whose family had originated in the Ukraine where Brody is the name of a town - was a hospital doctor. His mother had come to Britain from Austria after the 1938 Anschluss and still lives in Sheffield. His parents met when his mother was assigned to his father's hospital to do nursing work. They got engaged three weeks later. Brody's maternal grandmother always lived with the family and he says his childhood benefited enormously from her determination that he would not be \"merely English\". He says she came from a well-connected family, was very central European in her attitudes and, \"thought England was a bleak rock in the Atlantic. And as for Sheffield...\" She spoke to Brody in French, taught him Latin and played chess with him. \"So I ended up having borscht and gefilte fish and goulash and being sent to Hebrew classes three times a week, but I also went to a Church of England school and my brother and I were both given very English Christian names. It was a double existence.\" Tony Brody is three years older than Hugh and, after an initial career as a nuclear physicist, is now a heart surgeon in Illinois. Hugh says there was always an unspoken bias towards achieving and contributing to society in the family. \"My father was rarely at home where we wanted him. He was always out doing good as a doctor. I'm sure that planted something in me about 'doing good' being what really mattered. I have to fight against that to spend more time with my own children.\" After attending Montessori nursery and then a C of E prep school - where Michael Palin was a fellow pupil - Brody was sent as a boarder to Uppingham public school in Rutland. \"It was a middle-class, middle-ranking school in the middle of England. I had my barmitzvah and then I prayed to a Christian god twice a day in chapel.\" He says his best friend at school was, coincidentally, also Jewish but they encountered little obvious anti-Semitism apart from having to take the roles of a pair of merchants with heavily exaggerated London Jewish accents in a school play. \"That probably was a little exercise in anti-semitism,\" he says now. \"People were probably more aware of it than I realised. But at the time I thought my brother encountered more because he looked more Jewish than me.\" Unsurprisingly the move from his liberal, intellectual, multi- lingual home to a very illiberal authoritarian, Anglican school wasn't easy. He left as soon he could and took a job in an accountants' office in Sheffield where he \"wore a suit and had a miserable life\". This drove him to return to education and he successfully sat the Oxford entrance exams. Before taking up his place he spent six months in Israel doing a series of manual jobs on a kibbutz. His father was a strong Zionist and Brody says he remembers having a \"surge of Zionist anxiety during the 1967 war. But after that I came to a more considered view of Israel which put an end to any simple-minded Zionism.\" The opening story in Brody's 1991 collection of fiction, Means Of Escape, features a woman not unlike his grandmother and deals with the destruction of her family during the holocaust. Is it too pat to say that his interest in and empathy with endangered peoples comes from this family history? \"It has been said that it is Highland Scots and Jews that have done most of the work on social theory going back to the 18th century because in their background is this huge displacement and dispossession,\" he says. \"In my case there is an echo.\" His grandmother had lived an ostensibly very comfortable and safe life in an assimilated Jewish family in Vienna. \"They thought they had nothing to fear,\" Brody says: \"As that great line has it, they thought they were Germans. The fact that my grandmother was not safe after all was a big thing for her. When I was a child, people from the Jewish community with tattoos would come to the house. My grandmother always made a point of showing them to me, but while I was alerted to the Holocaust I wasn't given the details.\" When he went up to Oxford to read PPE he says he felt, \"as if life had begun\". He also claims he was lucky to be there before the 60s really kicked in. \"Things were loosening up but we still took the work seriously and we were subservient enough to actually read our books and write our essays. If I had gone five years later I wouldn't have read my books or done my essays, but would have been involved in street activism or whatever. When I was there working hard was taken for granted.\" He was, nevertheless, socially concerned - committed to the peace movement and inspired by the CND Committee of 100. \"In my first term at Oxford I did a public fast with five other students over Christmas to publicise how much was spent per second on defence. We were outside all of Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and Boxing Day.\" He was quickly identified as someone to watch and was invited to meet Isaiah Berlin. \"There was a part of me at Oxford that was quite depressed, but there was another part that just gorged on it,\" he remembers. \"It can be a very lonely place, but intellectually it seemed there were things to be had. I was very reluctant to take my finals because I thought it might lead me to a path I couldn't get off. I painted and wrote a lot of fiction and wanted to pursue this side of my life, but all these people were saying 'join us', so in the end I convinced myself that that is what I wanted.\" After his degree he undertook research into social theory but soon moved to more practical work. \"I realised I didn't want to spend my life in libraries. I wanted to work with people. I also didn't want to hang on the coat-tails of great thinkers and I didn't want to write about what one person has written about another person.\" He got a job at Belfast University teaching social philosophy and began field work into rural communities in the west of Ireland. Six months later he quit the job and went to work full time on his writing and research. \"There was a feeling of coming home with the field work. I realised that the most interesting thing in the world is what people have to say. Listening to people is what I wanted to do.\" Out of this period came his first book, Inishkillane: Change And Decline In The West Of Ireland. While in Ireland he began a nine-year relationship with art student Christine Moore. She went on to become a student of Chinese, moved to China and now lives in Canada. In 1980 he met Miranda Tufnell, a dancer who is the mother of his first two children. His son Tomo is 17 and works as a volunteer in a home for children with epilepsy, and Jonah is 15 and at school. He and Tufnell were together for 10 years and after they broke up he lived alone and travelled a great deal - \"there is nothing like a broken relationship to throw you into field work\" - before he met the actress Juliet Stevenson at a dinner party in London in 1993. When Stevenson was profiled in these pages in 1998 she said, \"I walked into the room and my heart went boom. Something weird seemed to happen in my gut.\" After they met they didn't see each other for a couple of months because she was working in California. \"This was pre email,\" says Brody, \"so there were lots of letters and phone calls and faxes.\" The couple now live together in Highgate, north London, and have a six-year-old daughter, Rosalind, and a new baby son, Gabriel, born just before Christmas. \"The baby was a bit of a surprise,\" concedes Brody, \"and we did worry at first that we were too old, and would we have enough money. But we then realised what could be greater than spending time with a new baby?\" The former England cricket captain - now psychoanalyst - Mike Brearley is working with Brody on a film about psychoanalysis. He is struck by the different worlds Brody inhabits and the number of areas of thought he is interested in. \"And of course it is striking that he has small children and he goes off to the Arctic or Africa every now and again,\" adds Brearley. \"In a way one feels slightly envious that he can go off and live in a different world and understand it to a great degree. But it must be very unsettling for him and unsettling for the family.\" Brody agrees. \"So much of my work depends on travel. When the boys were young they did come on trips, and even in the last year my three older children have been to Africa with me. The greatest joy for me is to include them and the greatest pain is leaving the children. Missing them eats into my heart.\" As a result of his work in Ireland he decided he wanted to go to a colonial frontier and in 1969 made his first major trip to Canada. His first book from the region, Indians On Skid Row, about alcoholism and crime among Indian migrants in Edmonton, was published in 1971. That same year he was offered a post with the Canadian department for Indian and northern affairs, researching and advising on government policy. \"I went to the Arctic to see what the problems were and that was a timely thing to do. Problems had accumulated over the years and no-one had listened. People were very alarmed as to what was happening to their land, to their children, to their homes and to their culture.\" He went on to write The People's Land in 1975 before moving south to the eastern foothills of the Rockies, where his work preparing cultural and hunting maps with the Dunne-za and Cree was written up in his highly acclaimed Maps And Dreams in 1981. In 1987 he wrote the book Living Arctic to accompany an exhibition of the same name at the British Museum. His first film, The Eskimos Of Pond Inlet, made in 1975, was directed by the respected documentary maker Mike Grigsby for Granada's Disappearing World series. Brody has gone on to make a series of documentaries. \"I saw Mike Grigsby's film about fishermen in Fleetwood and it opened my eyes to what documentary film could do,\" he explains. He always works in collaboration with his subjects, and sometimes gives them powers of veto. He sees himself more as an ambassador than a journalist. \"I do try to be as true as possible to what people say they want.\" The writer Anthony Barnett, Brody's friend for over 30 years, says the self-effacing way Brody has worked in both film and in print makes it sometimes difficult to catch his voice: \"He has always tried to avoid the sterility of institutionalisation and always wants to allow for a knight's move to escape. But there's also an argument he wants to have, and it's now time for him to stand and argue his ground. One of the great things about this new book is that he is really beginning to speak as Hugh Brody.\" Brody says the three key issues facing indigenous peoples are land rights, the ramifications of abuse some of them suffered in residential schools and other government programmes over the last century, and the loss of language. \"Everywhere - in Australia, Africa, Canada or the US - you find people in individual and collective crises about language. It is a source of dismay and despair because what does it mean to live in an oral culture and lose your language? They want their account of the facts to be acknowledged, their place in history to be acknowledged and their losses to be acknowledged. Language is crucial for all these. When I was learning Inuktitut my teacher would say all the time, 'I'm not teaching you for fun. I want you to speak for us'.\" Brody says that learning native languages reverses the colonial relationship, as these peoples' experience of life had been shaped and embittered by always being regarded as ignorant. \"They didn't know English, how to use pots and pans, orderly time, how to give their children formula milk, cure their diseases, repair their guns, or 'the true religion'. Colonialism constitutes them as ignoramuses - vessels to be filled with the truth. But if you ask them to teach you their language you give them a chance to reverse this - you are the one who doesn't know anything. Instead of saying 'seal' you say 'penis' and they all laugh at you.\" It is partly through his facility for languages - he speaks French, German, Hebrew and two Inuktitut dialects - that he has been able to infiltrate so effectively the communities he has worked in. John Berger notes that he is also a \"fantastic storyteller. But unlike many people gifted with languages he doesn't feel obliged to talk; instead he listens a great deal. The relationships he is able to establish inspire confidence. People recognise that he is going to be dependable.\" Leslie Pinder is a Canadian lawyer and novelist who has worked on several landmark legal cases. She first met Brody in the mid 70s when, as an expert witness, he was called to explain how the indigenous people lived in a case concerning Indian land given to soldiers returning from the second world war which subsequently yielded substantial oil and gas revenues. She says he was an ideal witness. \"He's not always looking at notes or historical records but has an easy command of first-hand knowledge. And he's also such a good storyteller. The Crown assumed a lot of things about these people that was completely wrong. But Hugh took the judge and the whole court on a metaphorical hunting trip to explain how the people related to this land.\" Perhaps the most significant public project he was involved with was the massive Sardar Sarovan dam in western India. At the time it was the largest water project in the world and proposed raising a huge river by 145m so gravity could feed 75,000kms of canals to bring water to 30m people. But by 1988 it had become the most hotly contested environmental project in the world and the funder, the World Bank, was forced to hold an independent review. Brody was one of four experts the bank brought in to assess the complex issue of resettlement for those who would lose their lands and livelihoods from the proposed dam. He exploded the claim that \"only\" 70,000 people would be displaced - it would have been nearer to 400,000 - while making clear that irrigation was still needed. \"I was very moved by the desperate pleas for water,\" he says. \"We didn't say in our report that these people shouldn't get water. But we did say that there was a cost in that many others would lose their land, their resources and their livelihoods.\" The experts' core recommendation that the World Bank withdraw from the project was \"unequivocal and unexpected\", wrote Arundhati Roy, the Booker prizewinner, two years ago, in an account of the environmental and political battle. What their report revealed, she wrote, \"is scandalous\". Last October, after years of legal wrangling, India's Supreme Court ruled that construction of the dam should be completed as \"expeditiously\" as possible. Brody was brought to the project by the inquiry's vice-chair, the former Canadian judge, Thomas Berger, who had first encountered him in the mid-70s while chairing an inquiry into a proposed pipeline through the western arctic. Brody was an expert witness for the aboriginal people. \"We couldn't have done it without Hugh,\" Berger says of the World Bank report. \"He was absolutely invaluable and had a tremendous input. He is truly a renaissance man and a citizen of the world. He's an international treasure.\" A large part of Brody's work has revolved around getting to know exactly how people relate to their resources and mapping their relationships with the land. Since 1997 he has been visiting the southern Kalahari desert three to four times a year for up to six weeks, working with bushmen who have been displaced by large parks. But it is clear that more northern latitudes still entrance him. \"I felt deeply content in the Arctic,\" he says. \"While working on this book I thought much more directly about why I was so at ease with people who don't like schedules, who decide what they are going to do while they are doing it, who are in some sense disorganised although are of course highly organised underneath. It is partly because I am disorganised, but there was also something that spoke to me and not just to me. \"I have talked to lots of people who have done similar fieldwork and nearly all of them have found something deeply satisfying and compelling there. It has a hold on you. There is something about hunter-gatherer lives and languages that grabs you and keeps hold of you, and writing about this convinced me there was something about the life that is immensely to be admired and learnt from.\" Roger Scruton says that while Brody is a wonderful guide to these worlds he is not blindly romantic. \"He is a modern person but nevertheless has a lyrical sense of what has been lost. And he is a genuinely philosophical writer about these things. He brings them into relation with our experience and meditates on what it means for us.\" Brody acknowledges the fundamental division. \"My attraction to hunter-gatherer life doesn't displace my love of European civilisation or my desire to be in a community of people who are similar to myself,\" he says. \"My life hasn't been dedicated to an idea that there is another sort of life we should all live. I don't commit to any wild romanticism about it. At one stage I did decide to stay in the north but in the end I suppose it's interesting that I didn't do it. I've always liked the far north, I have always felt I could breath in the Arctic.

      "body": "<p>The late Lorna Sage was a professor of English with some distinguished academic books to her name. But the work she will be remembered for is a childhood memoir. Bad Blood carried off the Whitbread biography award, only narrowly missing the overall prize. What is it about the book that has so caught the imagination? Why are memoirs so popular? What exactly is a memoir? These are question that prompt some head-scratching. According to one publisher, the memoir boom started with St Augustine and was given a new impetus in the 20th century by Freud's emphasis on self-revelation. According to another, it is a largely American phenomenon. </p> <p>In fact, it is a dizzyingly broad genre, ranging from ghosted autobiography to what might be called interpretative fiction - a form that allows the possibility that someone else might have an entirely different reading of the same events. One of its few common denominators is that it shows a life refracted through a particular experience - whether that be childhood, war or sleeping with a Rolling Stone. </p> <p>Thousands pour off the world's presses every year: Frank McCourt's two instalments of his Irish childhood and American youth have taken up permanent residence at the top of the bestsellers lists on both sides of the Atlantic; Nick Hornby's series of memoirs chronicling the obsessions of the young urban male have created a whole new sub-genre of their own. </p> <p>You can find specific reasons for the success of individual memoirs - McCourt's was driven by America's sentimental attachment to its Irish roots. But Angela's Ashes and 'Tis are not alone in appearing to feed a ravenous hunger for personalised history. We wolf down terrible stories of abuse and neglect, we gobble up lives that somehow chime with our own; we nibble at the exotic, the strange and the exciting. </p> <p>Last year's crop gives a sense of the huge range of memoirs, from the pedigree literary excitement of Martin Amis's Experience to the puppyish cavortings of Dave Eggers's A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius . But one feature of the genre is that it is not the preserve of the big international publishing house. The Road from Nab End, one man's reminiscences of growing up in the Lancashire weaving heartlands in the depression, has sold 19,000 copies for Eland Press, while an amusing anecdotal memoir of National Service, Brasso Blanco and Bull , has notched up 30,000 sales for Constable Robinson, after initially being self-published by its author Tony Thorne. These might not be the McCourt millions, but it puts the unknown Thorne neck-and-neck in sales terms with Amis. </p> <p>Amis's Experience represents one of the most common forms of memoir - it offers celebrity, a recognisable sensibility and the private version of stories that have already been played out in public. Kingsley Amis, it has been said, emerges from the book like a character in a Martin Amis novel - hardly surprising, since memoir is all about the appropriation of memory. </p> <p>More problematic is Amis's appropriation of the story of his cousin, Lucy Partington, who was murdered by Fred West. It is uncomfortable because he admits he hardly knew her - so, in a macabre inflation of memoir's intrinsic untrustworthiness, he is not really telling her story at all, but is toying with the feelings it evokes in him (and us). </p> <p>It is the lot of the memoirist to ruffle feathers. If Amis ruffled them by venturing beyond his strict first-hand knowledge, John Bayley's memoir of his wife, Iris Murdoch, offended some with its skewed intimacy, its immodest rummaging in the marital sock-drawer. </p> <p> Iris is a loving account of the indestructibility of an individual, even when most of what she represented has been blotted out. Yet because Murdoch is famous for something quite other than Alzheimer's disease, it also appeals to our prurience, our love of gossip, our sneaking, vindictive delight in seeing the the mighty fall. Does the quality of its writing make this memoir any nobler than, say, Ike Turner's squalid (ghosted) account of his drugs, violence and adultery? </p> <p>On the contrary, in some ways its literary quality makes it less noble. As Frank Kermode said in his autobiography: \"My belief is that the honest truth, insofar as this suggests absolute fidelity to historical fact, is inaccessible; the minute you begin to write it you try to write it well, and writing well is an activity which has no simple relation to truth. For memory cannot do the necessary work independently of fantasy...\" </p> <p>Bayley is a well-known writer writing about another well-known writer. But the startling point about many of today's star memoirists is that they are not famous. Who has ever heard of Andrea Ashworth, unless they happen to be one of the 175,000 people who have bought copies of her memoir Once in a House on Fire? </p> <p>One of the most familiar tricks of the genre is to appear to be self-deprecating while actually painting a picture of heroic endurance. Dave Eggers plays the trick in reverse - he declares himself heroic and then constantly undermines his own plausibility by pratting around and openly improvising. He flies so close to the invisible boundary between fact and fiction that his book was reviewed several times as a novel. </p> <p>If Eggers's games with truth and invention offer one perspective on relationship between fiction and memoir, Margaret Drabble's latest novel offers another. The Peppered Moth calls itself a novel, but is so clearly a settling of family scores that it is, at the very least, flirting with the conventions of memoir. </p> <p>Drabble has admitted that Bessie - northern scholarship girl turned shrewish wife and sour, suffocating matriarch - is based on her own mother, but has not declared it a memoir, preferring to clothe her memories in the figleaf of fiction. </p> <p>Yet is it possible that, in its open-endedness, the memoir is actually more generous than fiction, and that is what we instinctively value about it? Certainly, some of the best-selling memoirs tell stories that are so grim or so apparently incredible that they would be unsellable as fiction. Dave Pelzer's A Child Called It is one of these - a best-seller fashioned from the most appalling child abuse. Significantly, over three books (the latest out this month), Pelzer traces an arc from horror to forgiveness. It is an odd quirk of these hard-luck tales that the very fact they are memoirs means the writer must have pulled through. We can read them as survivor stories. </p> <p>This is not true of the biggest horror story of the last century: the holocaust, which is almost too massive to be put into fiction at all. Yet the words tumble out, from survivors and, more recently, from the children of survivors. Anne Karpf's The War After is one of these. </p> <p>Karpf's parents had survived the death camps, but would never talk about them. They existed in her childhood as a silent reproach for any malady or complaint. She thought the experience was unique to her, until hundreds of readers wrote to her saying they recognised the experience but had never before been able to articulate it. \"I feel I tapped into the zeitgeist,\" she says. </p> <p>In this case, the memoir carries the burden of witness: by asserting itself as part of the documentation of atrocity it becomes part of the healing process. Only by hearing thousands of such accounts will we be able to understand the incomprehensible. This gives the memoir a troubling but also privileged position. </p> <p>Perhaps the key to the memoir boom lies in the crisis of historical confidence that the last century wreaked on us. We no longer believe in objectivity; we don't trust the history books to tell the story of ourselves, whether because it is too disturbing or merely too mundane. But we are desperate for that story to be told, so we look for lives that intersect with the bits of history that affect us. The great power of the memoir is that, when it works, it reaches far beyond the bright, tight world of the regular book-buyer.

      "bodyText": "The late Lorna Sage was a professor of English with some distinguished academic books to her name. But the work she will be remembered for is a childhood memoir. Bad Blood carried off the Whitbread biography award, only narrowly missing the overall prize. What is it about the book that has so caught the imagination? Why are memoirs so popular? What exactly is a memoir? These are question that prompt some head-scratching. According to one publisher, the memoir boom started with St Augustine and was given a new impetus in the 20th century by Freud's emphasis on self-revelation. According to another, it is a largely American phenomenon. In fact, it is a dizzyingly broad genre, ranging from ghosted autobiography to what might be called interpretative fiction - a form that allows the possibility that someone else might have an entirely different reading of the same events. One of its few common denominators is that it shows a life refracted through a particular experience - whether that be childhood, war or sleeping with a Rolling Stone. Thousands pour off the world's presses every year: Frank McCourt's two instalments of his Irish childhood and American youth have taken up permanent residence at the top of the bestsellers lists on both sides of the Atlantic; Nick Hornby's series of memoirs chronicling the obsessions of the young urban male have created a whole new sub-genre of their own. You can find specific reasons for the success of individual memoirs - McCourt's was driven by America's sentimental attachment to its Irish roots. But Angela's Ashes and 'Tis are not alone in appearing to feed a ravenous hunger for personalised history. We wolf down terrible stories of abuse and neglect, we gobble up lives that somehow chime with our own; we nibble at the exotic, the strange and the exciting. Last year's crop gives a sense of the huge range of memoirs, from the pedigree literary excitement of Martin Amis's Experience to the puppyish cavortings of Dave Eggers's A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius . But one feature of the genre is that it is not the preserve of the big international publishing house. The Road from Nab End, one man's reminiscences of growing up in the Lancashire weaving heartlands in the depression, has sold 19,000 copies for Eland Press, while an amusing anecdotal memoir of National Service, Brasso Blanco and Bull , has notched up 30,000 sales for Constable Robinson, after initially being self-published by its author Tony Thorne. These might not be the McCourt millions, but it puts the unknown Thorne neck-and-neck in sales terms with Amis. Amis's Experience represents one of the most common forms of memoir - it offers celebrity, a recognisable sensibility and the private version of stories that have already been played out in public. Kingsley Amis, it has been said, emerges from the book like a character in a Martin Amis novel - hardly surprising, since memoir is all about the appropriation of memory. More problematic is Amis's appropriation of the story of his cousin, Lucy Partington, who was murdered by Fred West. It is uncomfortable because he admits he hardly knew her - so, in a macabre inflation of memoir's intrinsic untrustworthiness, he is not really telling her story at all, but is toying with the feelings it evokes in him (and us). It is the lot of the memoirist to ruffle feathers. If Amis ruffled them by venturing beyond his strict first-hand knowledge, John Bayley's memoir of his wife, Iris Murdoch, offended some with its skewed intimacy, its immodest rummaging in the marital sock-drawer. Iris is a loving account of the indestructibility of an individual, even when most of what she represented has been blotted out. Yet because Murdoch is famous for something quite other than Alzheimer's disease, it also appeals to our prurience, our love of gossip, our sneaking, vindictive delight in seeing the the mighty fall. Does the quality of its writing make this memoir any nobler than, say, Ike Turner's squalid (ghosted) account of his drugs, violence and adultery? On the contrary, in some ways its literary quality makes it less noble. As Frank Kermode said in his autobiography: \"My belief is that the honest truth, insofar as this suggests absolute fidelity to historical fact, is inaccessible; the minute you begin to write it you try to write it well, and writing well is an activity which has no simple relation to truth. For memory cannot do the necessary work independently of fantasy...\" Bayley is a well-known writer writing about another well-known writer. But the startling point about many of today's star memoirists is that they are not famous. Who has ever heard of Andrea Ashworth, unless they happen to be one of the 175,000 people who have bought copies of her memoir Once in a House on Fire? One of the most familiar tricks of the genre is to appear to be self-deprecating while actually painting a picture of heroic endurance. Dave Eggers plays the trick in reverse - he declares himself heroic and then constantly undermines his own plausibility by pratting around and openly improvising. He flies so close to the invisible boundary between fact and fiction that his book was reviewed several times as a novel. If Eggers's games with truth and invention offer one perspective on relationship between fiction and memoir, Margaret Drabble's latest novel offers another. The Peppered Moth calls itself a novel, but is so clearly a settling of family scores that it is, at the very least, flirting with the conventions of memoir. Drabble has admitted that Bessie - northern scholarship girl turned shrewish wife and sour, suffocating matriarch - is based on her own mother, but has not declared it a memoir, preferring to clothe her memories in the figleaf of fiction. Yet is it possible that, in its open-endedness, the memoir is actually more generous than fiction, and that is what we instinctively value about it? Certainly, some of the best-selling memoirs tell stories that are so grim or so apparently incredible that they would be unsellable as fiction. Dave Pelzer's A Child Called It is one of these - a best-seller fashioned from the most appalling child abuse. Significantly, over three books (the latest out this month), Pelzer traces an arc from horror to forgiveness. It is an odd quirk of these hard-luck tales that the very fact they are memoirs means the writer must have pulled through. We can read them as survivor stories. This is not true of the biggest horror story of the last century: the holocaust, which is almost too massive to be put into fiction at all. Yet the words tumble out, from survivors and, more recently, from the children of survivors. Anne Karpf's The War After is one of these. Karpf's parents had survived the death camps, but would never talk about them. They existed in her childhood as a silent reproach for any malady or complaint. She thought the experience was unique to her, until hundreds of readers wrote to her saying they recognised the experience but had never before been able to articulate it. \"I feel I tapped into the zeitgeist,\" she says. In this case, the memoir carries the burden of witness: by asserting itself as part of the documentation of atrocity it becomes part of the healing process. Only by hearing thousands of such accounts will we be able to understand the incomprehensible. This gives the memoir a troubling but also privileged position. Perhaps the key to the memoir boom lies in the crisis of historical confidence that the last century wreaked on us. We no longer believe in objectivity; we don't trust the history books to tell the story of ourselves, whether because it is too disturbing or merely too mundane. But we are desperate for that story to be told, so we look for lives that intersect with the bits of history that affect us. The great power of the memoir is that, when it works, it reaches far beyond the bright, tight world of the regular book-buyer. It touches a common humanity we sometimes fear no longer exists. Me, myself, I: Frank Conroy's Stop-Time (1967) is a story of adolescence, credited with starting the post-war memoir boom. Into the history books: As I Walked Out One Midsummer Morning (1969). Laurie Lee takes the Spanish Civil War in his stride. It's cold up north: Catherine Cookson's Our Kate (1969) is a typical memoir of childhood deprivation, set in Tyneside. Her many novels repeated the theme. All boys together. Nick Hornby's Fever Pitch (1992) made male emotion a legitimate pitch for the literary memoir and led the middle-class assault on the football terraces. Near-death experiences: Jean Dominique Bauby's The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly (1997) is an account of life after a stroke. Typifies the now-familiar memoir of living with catastrophic illness. Kiss and tell: The Kiss (1997), by Kathryn Harrison. Spills the beans on a four-year affair the novelist had with her own father. A prime example of the confessional memoir that was so popular in the 1990s. Biting the hand: Sir Vidia's Shadow (1998).

In fact, English Passengers is a distinguished addition to a vein of post-war British writing that has featured in the literary prize lists these 30 years or more: a spreading clump of historical fiction whose underlying assumption might be characterised not as \"my country, right or wrong\" but, quite simply, as \"my country, wrong\". </p> <p>The origins of the post-colonial novel can be traced back to a period well before the post-war imperial retreat.

The literary landscapes of the past 40 years are littered with novels that, set variously in India, Ireland and even further-flung nooks and crannies of the old pink-tinted colonial map, mine these themes of imperial duplicity and decay: J G Farrell's The Siege of Krishnapur (Booker Prize 1973) and his earlier Troubles (1970), William Boyd's An Ice-Cream War (Booker shortlist 1982), Marianne Wiggins's John Dollar (1989), Barry Unsworth's Sacred Hunger (Booker Prize 1992), and Peter Carey's Oscar and Lucinda (Booker Prize 1988). </p> <p>What kind of books are these, in which the white man's burden, taken off into a quiet clearing and stealthily unpacked, turns out to contain all kinds of alluring plunder?

The public past it outlined is not one of triumph and achievement, but one inglorious and violent.

And at each individual novel's core lies a powerful deconstruction of long-standing myths: English superiority and \"civilisation\", benign colonialism, the scrupulous conduct of public life, even - and this is perhaps the most profound deconstruction of all - the idea that there is such a thing as shared history.

Farrell's Troubles , for example, examines the Irish Uprising of the 1920s through the lives of a group of Irish men and women closeted in the backwater of a seaside hotel. The allegorical focus is a gang of cats. Early sections of the novel feature a pack of dogs that are seen milling round the outbuildings.

In the same way, anyone who has seen pictures by Diane Arbus or Garry Winogrand has an inkling of the part played by John Szarkowski in the development of post-war photography. </p> <p>Szarkowski took over as director of photography at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 1962. He curated landmark exhibitions such as \"New Documents\" (1967), which aimed to show how a \"new generation of photographers\" - Arbus et al - had \"directed the documentary approach toward more personal ends\". It's not just that Szarkowski provided a forum for photographers; he also established a new sense of what photographs could look like, and he practised the art he championed. </p> <p>In the 1950s he made a series of photographs of buildings by the architect who pioneered the development of the skyscraper, Louis Sullivan (1856-1924). Frank Lloyd Wright - who worked for and revered Sullivan - considered them the best photographs of \"the Master's\" buildings that he had come across. It's easy to see why. Instead of simply showing a building, these photographs encourage you visually to walk round it. A door glimpsed in one picture becomes the vantage point from which another facet of the building is viewed in the next. It is like a virtual experience in two dimensions. One's sense both of the intricacies of the buildings' design and, crucially, of their histories as buildings - what Szarkowski calls their \"life-facts\" - is constantly enhanced by the little human dramas being played out in and around them. </p> <p>This is impressive enough. Sullivan's importance, however, lies not just in what he built but in the vision his buildings embodied. Architects had built high before but, as Wright put it, until Sullivan they \"were fighting height instead of gracefully and honestly accepting it\". As far as Sullivan himself was concerned, a skyscraper had to \"be tall, every inch of it tall.\" Rarely can William Carlos Williams's credo - \"no ideas but in things\" - have been so vertiginously realised. When he expressed these ideas in writing, Sullivan had a tendency to sub-Whitman grandiloquence, but Szarkowski interpolates quotations in such a way that his book does not just describe but realises Sullivan's genius both photographically and critically. </p> <p>Sullivan fell into ruin, ended up as a drunk. In Szarkowski's pictures, the interior of the Chicago Auditorium is peeling, decaying. These glimpses are like portents of the decline that will become the subject of photographs in Camilo Jose Vergara's American Ruins. Already, by the time Szarkowski saw it, Sullivan's famous Prudential Building in Buffalo, New York, was sufficiently dilapidated to persuade him to photograph it \"immediately, before it was further defaced\". This task of photographic preservation makes one think of Eugene Atget in Paris. </p> <p>First published in 1956, The Idea of Louis Sullivan came into existence partly due to Walker Evans who, according to Szarkowski, was \"closest to becoming Atget's artistic successor\". By a happy coincidence, a new edition - a visual equivalent of a re-mix - of the young man's work comes out at the same time as his latest book, on Atget. </p> <p>Atget photographed a Paris that had become abruptly old in the wake of Baron Haussmann's civic planning. Modestly providing \"documents\" for artists and other commercial clients, Atget built up a massive inventory of the city's streets, statues, alleys, and courtyards that has since become the ghostly reservoir of a distinctive aesthetic sensibility. Intended as an objective record, his work so fascinated Man Ray that he wanted to publish it in La R\u00e9volution Surr\u00e9aliste (Atget agreed, reluctantly, on condition that his name was not used). Through Ray it came to the attention of Berenice Abbott, who intervened to ensure the preservation of Atget's archive after his death in 1927. </p> <p>Little is known about Atget. He is another of those photographers, like Bellocq and William Gedney, who exist almost entirely in terms of what they saw. Embodying this in the conception of his book, Szarkowski provides only the briefest of introductions. The rest of the text comprises \"captions\" that cast, as it were, sidelong glances at the accompanying pictures in order to \"name some of the qualities that reside in them\". Just as Atget's vision of Paris is made up of incremental views and details, so Szarkowski's idea of Atget emerges gradually (there are no overviews), subtly. We respond to the book in kind: it is so original that it takes a while to realise that this is not simply a great photography book but a work of genius. </p> <p>Walter Benjamin famously remarked that Atget photographed Paris as if it were the scene of a crime. He was referring to the fact that Atget's deserted streets (a result, in part, of long exposure times that erased moving people or carriages) are photographed \"for the purpose of establishing evidence\". As such, Benjamin continues, \"free-floating contemplation is not appropriate to them\". On this score Szarkowski proves Benjamin wrong beyond reasonable doubt. His captions are simultaneously oblique parables and historical musings, investigations of photographic technique and metaphysical essays that can, at any moment, develop into exquisite, unpeopled fictions. Reading them is like watching the photos breathe. Idiosyncratic, speculative (\"I do not think that empty chairs meant the same thing before photography as they mean to us now\"), they might even seem whimsical were it not for the immense foundation of technical understanding on which they are based. </p> <p>It is often said that historians bring their learning to bear on the subjects they discuss. That needs to be modified here. Szarkowski proceeds with such delicacy that each photograph is brushed with his forensic knowledge of the period and the medium.

In the same way, anyone who has seen pictures by Diane Arbus or Garry Winogrand has an inkling of the part played by John Szarkowski in the development of post-war photography. Szarkowski took over as director of photography at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 1962. He curated landmark exhibitions such as \"New Documents\" (1967), which aimed to show how a \"new generation of photographers\" - Arbus et al - had \"directed the documentary approach toward more personal ends\". It's not just that Szarkowski provided a forum for photographers; he also established a new sense of what photographs could look like, and he practised the art he championed. In the 1950s he made a series of photographs of buildings by the architect who pioneered the development of the skyscraper, Louis Sullivan (1856-1924). Frank Lloyd Wright - who worked for and revered Sullivan - considered them the best photographs of \"the Master's\" buildings that he had come across. It's easy to see why. Instead of simply showing a building, these photographs encourage you visually to walk round it. A door glimpsed in one picture becomes the vantage point from which another facet of the building is viewed in the next. It is like a virtual experience in two dimensions. One's sense both of the intricacies of the buildings' design and, crucially, of their histories as buildings - what Szarkowski calls their \"life-facts\" - is constantly enhanced by the little human dramas being played out in and around them. This is impressive enough. Sullivan's importance, however, lies not just in what he built but in the vision his buildings embodied. Architects had built high before but, as Wright put it, until Sullivan they \"were fighting height instead of gracefully and honestly accepting it\". As far as Sullivan himself was concerned, a skyscraper had to \"be tall, every inch of it tall.\" Rarely can William Carlos Williams's credo - \"no ideas but in things\" - have been so vertiginously realised. When he expressed these ideas in writing, Sullivan had a tendency to sub-Whitman grandiloquence, but Szarkowski interpolates quotations in such a way that his book does not just describe but realises Sullivan's genius both photographically and critically. Sullivan fell into ruin, ended up as a drunk. In Szarkowski's pictures, the interior of the Chicago Auditorium is peeling, decaying. These glimpses are like portents of the decline that will become the subject of photographs in Camilo Jose Vergara's American Ruins. Already, by the time Szarkowski saw it, Sullivan's famous Prudential Building in Buffalo, New York, was sufficiently dilapidated to persuade him to photograph it \"immediately, before it was further defaced\". This task of photographic preservation makes one think of Eugene Atget in Paris. First published in 1956, The Idea of Louis Sullivan came into existence partly due to Walker Evans who, according to Szarkowski, was \"closest to becoming Atget's artistic successor\". By a happy coincidence, a new edition - a visual equivalent of a re-mix - of the young man's work comes out at the same time as his latest book, on Atget. Atget photographed a Paris that had become abruptly old in the wake of Baron Haussmann's civic planning. Modestly providing \"documents\" for artists and other commercial clients, Atget built up a massive inventory of the city's streets, statues, alleys, and courtyards that has since become the ghostly reservoir of a distinctive aesthetic sensibility. Intended as an objective record, his work so fascinated Man Ray that he wanted to publish it in La R\u00e9volution Surr\u00e9aliste (Atget agreed, reluctantly, on condition that his name was not used). Through Ray it came to the attention of Berenice Abbott, who intervened to ensure the preservation of Atget's archive after his death in 1927. Little is known about Atget. He is another of those photographers, like Bellocq and William Gedney, who exist almost entirely in terms of what they saw. Embodying this in the conception of his book, Szarkowski provides only the briefest of introductions. The rest of the text comprises \"captions\" that cast, as it were, sidelong glances at the accompanying pictures in order to \"name some of the qualities that reside in them\". Just as Atget's vision of Paris is made up of incremental views and details, so Szarkowski's idea of Atget emerges gradually (there are no overviews), subtly. We respond to the book in kind: it is so original that it takes a while to realise that this is not simply a great photography book but a work of genius. Walter Benjamin famously remarked that Atget photographed Paris as if it were the scene of a crime. He was referring to the fact that Atget's deserted streets (a result, in part, of long exposure times that erased moving people or carriages) are photographed \"for the purpose of establishing evidence\". As such, Benjamin continues, \"free-floating contemplation is not appropriate to them\". On this score Szarkowski proves Benjamin wrong beyond reasonable doubt. His captions are simultaneously oblique parables and historical musings, investigations of photographic technique and metaphysical essays that can, at any moment, develop into exquisite, unpeopled fictions. Reading them is like watching the photos breathe. Idiosyncratic, speculative (\"I do not think that empty chairs meant the same thing before photography as they mean to us now\"), they might even seem whimsical were it not for the immense foundation of technical understanding on which they are based. It is often said that historians bring their learning to bear on the subjects they discuss. That needs to be modified here. Szarkowski proceeds with such delicacy that each photograph is brushed with his forensic knowledge of the period and the medium. Looking at a picture made in 1921-2 of cypress trees and a slightly broken white fence, Szarkowski notes that many critics and photographers assume that Atget was a 19th-century photographer. In fact, much of his greatest work was done while Ray, Edward Weston and others \"were defining the character of photographic high modernism\". When Szarkowski adds that this photo \"was made six or seven years after the great Paul Strand picture 'White Fence', which Atget surely never saw\", we see exactly what he means. These books are about two figures who made historic contributions to their respective disciplines; the same, now, must be said of their author.",

In March 1741, radicals set fire to New York. Fort George, the prime military fortification in British America, was reduced to ashes. Soon, other metropolitan landmarks were torched. These were no random conflagrations. Lying on the west side of Manhattan, Fort George was a site of huge strategic importance for the Atlantic trade and a nodal point of the Britain-Africa-Americas triangle.

Throughout the 1730s and 1740s revolts had been springing up all across the Americas.

Men such as \"Will\", who in 1733 was involved in a slave revolt on Danish St John, in which black rebels seized control of the island's military installation.

Buy it at a discount at BOL With thrillers especially, readers find themselves bombarded by worldwide bestselling authors they've never heard of: witness Matthew Reilly, touted as an \"international phenomenon\" at the age of 26. To go by the absence of critical comment on the back cover of Temple (Pan, \u00a35.99), its predecessor Ice Station achieved success without the benefit of reviews. Actually, there is very little to say, or recommend, about Temple except that it reads more like a computer game than a book, an update of Rider Haggard/Indiana Jones high adventure for the video age, which would be fine if it were any good. Boring good people, boring bad people, no wrinkles, remedial prose, too skippable. Buy it at a discount at BOL",

      "body": "<p>Glenn Hoddle, in his early days as England manager, when he was still capable of engaging his mouth without putting his foot in it, was asked by our own Mark Lawson about the power of prayer in a sporting context. Lawson wanted to know whether, as a born again whatever he is born again as, Hoddle would be enlisting the Almighty's support, for instance, during a penalty shoot-out. </p> <p>Amused by the idea, Hoddle replied that he thought God would be too busy to worry about such trivial things, he had major work on his hands after all - presumably deciding who should be reincarnated as a disabled person. </p> <p>With the way things turned out in St Etienne, when God moved in mysterious ways thus completely confusing David Batty, Hoddle was wise to be circumspect. Yet, despite the obvious hostage it offers to fortune, sports teams still try to seek celestial blessing before big games. </p> <p>The Irish rugby squad is the latest to believe that alongside a high carbohydrate diet, intensive fitness coaching and last-minute intake of Jaffa cakes, God's approval is just what is required to complete their preparations. </p> <p>They will all be seeking an audience with the Pope this weekend, hoping to benefit from the old boy's special relationship with upstairs ahead of their first Six Nations game against Italy next Saturday. </p> <p>Whether, in a sort of Whitehall farce in the Vatican, the Italians themselves will be coming in through one set of doors looking for their slice of benediction as the Irish leave through another is not yet known. </p> <p>Nor will we actually know whose side God is on until next Saturday afternoon when, you would think, He will be exhausted after being obliged by millions of supplicants across the world to adjudicate on behalf of their favoured team. </p> <p>But, even if nothing comes of it, the meeting with God's ambassador on earth will be one which several Ulster-born members of the squad will find something of a novelty. Indeed, with its cross-border make-up, the Irish rugby team has always answered the question about which side God is on with an enigmatic \"both\". </p> <p>Despite the Papal blessing, this is, after all, an entirely ecumenical outfit in an island riven with sectarianism. It is Irish rugby's great strength that for 80 minutes it unites Irishmen of all persuasions. The crowd at Lansdowne Road for internationals has traditionally been swollen by RUC officers, standing underneath fluttering tricolours, willing on the green-shirted boys to give the English a good kicking, before returning north over the border to defend the union by cracking a few nationalist heads. </p> <p>Elsewhere on these islands the position that God takes on sporting matters has been disputed in a much less inclusive manner. In Glasgow, back to the beginnings of organised sport, religion has been an ever-present fig leaf for prejudice. Tommy Docherty remembers playing in an Old Firm match in the 50s when the atmosphere was so poisonous it made Chernobyl seem a paragon of the clean air act. </p> <p>Docherty played for Celtic who, unlike Rangers, have never adopted a policy of recruiting players after first taking into account their position on transubstantiation. Before this particular game in the corner of the dressing room one of Docherty's colleagues, who happened to be a Protestant, was looking terrified. Docherty tried to comfort him. </p> <p>\"But you don't understand,\" said the full-back, \"I can't stand all the abuse. They always call me a Fenian bastard.\" </p> <p>\"Oh, that,\" said Docherty. \"For me that's just water off a duck's back.\" </p> <p>\"It's all very well for you to say that,\" said the player. \"You are one.\" </p> <p>At Ibrox in the past God was always reckoned to wear a bowler hat, carry a furled umbrella and have an edition of the collected speeches of Ian Paisley tucked under His arm. Yet, despite what some old-timers in attendance expected, when the Italian player Lorenzo Amoruso trotted on to the pitch on his debut, kissed his crucifix for good luck and extravagantly crossed himself, the ground did not open up, the turf remained intact and the south stand was not engulfed in the fires of hell. </p> <p>In fact, these days, now that it has become commonplace for certain members of Rangers' multi-national squad to engage in Catholic practices, crossing and re-crossing themselves as they search for the divine inspiration, the crowd barely bother with a sharp intake of breath - which, in many ways, counts as progress. </p> <p>And for those who maintain that even so it will be some time before we see Dick Advocaat winding up Rangers' winter break in Florida with a quick detour via the Vatican, I say this: with a 12-point deficit to overcome, nothing can be ruled out at this stage of the season.</p>",

Lawson wanted to know whether, as a born again whatever he is born again as, Hoddle would be enlisting the Almighty's support, for instance, during a penalty shoot-out. Amused by the idea, Hoddle replied that he thought God would be too busy to worry about such trivial things, he had major work on his hands after all - presumably deciding who should be reincarnated as a disabled person. With the way things turned out in St Etienne, when God moved in mysterious ways thus completely confusing David Batty, Hoddle was wise to be circumspect. Yet, despite the obvious hostage it offers to fortune, sports teams still try to seek celestial blessing before big games. The Irish rugby squad is the latest to believe that alongside a high carbohydrate diet, intensive fitness coaching and last-minute intake of Jaffa cakes, God's approval is just what is required to complete their preparations. They will all be seeking an audience with the Pope this weekend, hoping to benefit from the old boy's special relationship with upstairs ahead of their first Six Nations game against Italy next Saturday. Whether, in a sort of Whitehall farce in the Vatican, the Italians themselves will be coming in through one set of doors looking for their slice of benediction as the Irish leave through another is not yet known. Nor will we actually know whose side God is on until next Saturday afternoon when, you would think, He will be exhausted after being obliged by millions of supplicants across the world to adjudicate on behalf of their favoured team. But, even if nothing comes of it, the meeting with God's ambassador on earth will be one which several Ulster-born members of the squad will find something of a novelty. Indeed, with its cross-border make-up, the Irish rugby team has always answered the question about which side God is on with an enigmatic \"both\". Despite the Papal blessing, this is, after all, an entirely ecumenical outfit in an island riven with sectarianism. It is Irish rugby's great strength that for 80 minutes it unites Irishmen of all persuasions. The crowd at Lansdowne Road for internationals has traditionally been swollen by RUC officers, standing underneath fluttering tricolours, willing on the green-shirted boys to give the English a good kicking, before returning north over the border to defend the union by cracking a few nationalist heads. Elsewhere on these islands the position that God takes on sporting matters has been disputed in a much less inclusive manner. In Glasgow, back to the beginnings of organised sport, religion has been an ever-present fig leaf for prejudice. Tommy Docherty remembers playing in an Old Firm match in the 50s when the atmosphere was so poisonous it made Chernobyl seem a paragon of the clean air act. Docherty played for Celtic who, unlike Rangers, have never adopted a policy of recruiting players after first taking into account their position on transubstantiation. Before this particular game in the corner of the dressing room one of Docherty's colleagues, who happened to be a Protestant, was looking terrified. Docherty tried to comfort him. \"But you don't understand,\" said the full-back, \"I can't stand all the abuse. They always call me a Fenian bastard.\" \"Oh, that,\" said Docherty. \"For me that's just water off a duck's back.\" \"It's all very well for you to say that,\" said the player. \"You are one.\" At Ibrox in the past God was always reckoned to wear a bowler hat, carry a furled umbrella and have an edition of the collected speeches of Ian Paisley tucked under His arm. Yet, despite what some old-timers in attendance expected, when the Italian player Lorenzo Amoruso trotted on to the pitch on his debut, kissed his crucifix for good luck and extravagantly crossed himself, the ground did not open up, the turf remained intact and the south stand was not engulfed in the fires of hell. In fact, these days, now that it has become commonplace for certain members of Rangers' multi-national squad to engage in Catholic practices, crossing and re-crossing themselves as they search for the divine inspiration, the crowd barely bother with a sharp intake of breath - which, in many ways, counts as progress. And for those who maintain that even so it will be some time before we see Dick Advocaat winding up Rangers' winter break in Florida with a quick detour via the Vatican, I say this: with a 12-point deficit to overcome, nothing can be ruled out at this stage of the season.",

Despite starting early, I did not play many games and it is only since I came to England that people have noticed me.\" He felt, too, that he had become part of the furniture at Lyon, with the chairman treating him in the same patronising manner as when he was a young boy. So when he fell out with the coach his departure became a formality. </p> <p>Playing top-level football so young also brought physical problems, earning him an injury-prone reputation. But when he was recommended last season, Redknapp wanted only the usual West Ham question answered: can the boy play? He had his answer when Kanout\u00e9 made an outstanding debut against Wimbledon last March, joining Di Canio in scoring in a 2-1 win. He was just as impressive in his other seven games last season, scoring once more, and though Redknapp felt that he could not afford the \u00a33.7m fee to sign him permanently, the deal went through after Marc Vivien Fo\u00e9 agreed to travel in the other direction. </p> <p>Kanout\u00e9 turned down a move to Celtic before the loan deal at Upton Park and his form last season alerted Rangers, Chelsea and Liverpool. But, despite rumours that he is seeking a bigger stage, he insists: \"I am very happy at West Ham and I am very grateful to Harry Redknapp for giving me a chance and for improving my career.\" Rumours were fuelled when he made the hardly novel claim that he would have more chance of playing for France if he were at Manchester United, Arsenal or Liverpool. But Kevin Phillips recently made a similar comment vis-\u00e0-vis his England prospects without anyone suggesting he wanted a move from Sunderland. </p> <p>Kanout\u00e9 should recover from a hamstring injury to play tomorrow, having scored the consolation goal in a 3-1 defeat at Old Trafford on New Year's Day. West Ham have failed to beat United in any of their 14 Premiership encounters and Kanout\u00e9 subscribes to the Wenger theory that, though players may not lie down in front of their presumed masters, they are cowed. \"I really believe that players have it in their mind before the match that they are going to lose. But we must not feel like that on Sunday. I would think we should be able to beat them one time in five and maybe that occasion will be this time.\" </p> <p>Even though United play a more continental style of game, Kanout\u00e9 expects his normal bruising encounters with defenders. \"In France the game is more calculated; the coach tells the players when to challenge for the ball and when to play forward. In England defenders know only how to fight and be strong.\" That certainly sums up the Neville brothers, who may have their hands full. If Di Canio and Kanout\u00e9 actually learned to work together they could be even more devastating, but perhaps that is the secret of their partnership; if one rarely know what the other will do next, how can defences be expected to read them?</p>",

      "body": "<p>Were Tony Adams to step aside at Loftus Road this afternoon and allow Steve Morrow to score the winner for Queens Park Rangers it would be a fitting gesture. The Arsenal captain owes his former team-mate a favour when it comes to the FA Cup. </p> <p>By famously dropping Morrow on his shoulder at Wembley after the Irishman had won the Coca-Cola Cup for Arsenal in April 1993, Adams not only hinted that he might be on more than fizzy pop but denied Morrow a chance to repeat the trick against Sheffield Wednesday in the following month's FA Cup final. </p> <p>When Wednesday were beaten 2-1 in a replay, memories of Morrow being rushed off in agony with an oxygen mask over his face were still fresh. Less a fallen hero than one who had been dropped from a great height, he received an FA Cup winner's medal but celebrations were muted. Since then he has not been beyond the fourth round. </p> <p>\"Obviously I missed all the Coca-Cola Cup celebrations because I was under the knife,\" the 30-year-old says, \"but the worst thing for me was that I missed the FA Cup final a few weeks later. That was hard to take at the time.\" </p> <p>Not that he was tempted to hire a crane to exact revenge on Adams. \"Tony was devastated,\" he recalls. \"He was first down at the hospital the next day to see me. People think I must have been really angry with him but there was none of that. It was a complete accident.\" </p> <p>This will be Morrow's first meeting with Arsenal since he left for QPR in March 1997, six months after Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's arrival. In more than 12 at Highbury, which began as a schoolboy and included cleaning David O'Leary's boots, he made only 85 appearances. Yet, as well as scoring that Wembley winner, he played in two European Cup-Winners' Cup finals. </p> <p>Though the second against Zaragoza in 1995 ended in defeat, the first saw George Graham's team beat a Parma side including Faustino Asprilla, Gianfranco Zola and Tomas Brolin. Given QPR's plight, second from bottom of the First Division, today's tie is a rare return to the high life for the versatile, articulate Irishman. </p> <p>\"That's a great memory,\" he says of the Parma match. \"It was a good game to play in and we came through it when we weren't expected to win. I'd be the first to admit the squad then didn't have the ability or the talent the one now does but we were organised with George and tactically for the Parma game he got things spot on. </p> <p>\"We got an early goal [through Alan Smith] and defended well for the rest of the match. George played to the players' strengths but I think we got unfair criticism that we were a long-ball team, didn't pass as much as we should have done and all the rest.\" </p> <p>Morrow is one of four former Arsenal players at QPR, joining Chris Kiwomya, Matthew Rose and Lee Harper, yet of them all he might feel the change of career direction most acutely. He turned down Premiership offers to go to Loftus Road and expected a quick return to the top flight. </p> <p>When he arrived the team featured Trevor Sinclair, Andrew Impey, John Spencer and Danny Dichio among others. Now, after severe financial cutbacks caused by annual losses of around \u00a38m, Morrow is surrounded by astute signings such as Stuart Wardley, a one-time removal man, and Jermaine Darlington, who was working as a glazer and turning out for Aylesbury two years ago. </p> <p>\"It was a big wrench to leave Arsenal,\" says Morrow, who still visits the club's training ground. \"It had a lot to do with the fact that Stewart Houston was manager here with Bruce Rioch, and I don't regret it in any way. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger had just taken over and I wasn't playing regularly, so when the offer came up it wasn't too hard a decision. </p> <p>\"When I came here the club were doing well. We just missed out on the play-offs in my first season. Unfortunately, for a number of reasons, it's gone downhill since then but it's been more of a challenge. You can get into a rut some times and hang around being part of a squad.\" </p> <p>Trying to break into the renowned Highbury backline involved more hanging around than even Godot might inflict on anyone. Morrow made his Northern Ireland debut against Uruguay before he had played for Arsenal and appreciates what special mentors he had. </p> <p>\"I wouldn't say it was a doddle coming into the back four now and again when I was really young but it was much easier because there were experienced players around you like David O'Leary and Tony Adams,\" he says. \"They helped me out a hell of a lot. You look out there now for replacements for people like Tony but who is there who can just walk in and fill his shoes?\" </p> <p>With Adams and Co wobbling a little, QPR will fancy their chances, though it seems inconceivable these days that they finished above Arsenal in 1993 and 1995. Their manager Gerry Francis, a man twice sounded out by England, does not even watch Premiership matches now, instead taping lower-division games and taking himself to non-league grounds. </p> <p>Morrow hopes a rare release from the pressure of fighting relegation will inspire QPR and he is due a turn in fortune after missing much of last season with a shoulder injury. </p> <p>It does, he admits, upset him a little that his cup-final goal tends to get forgotten because of the crash landing that followed. If he gets the winner this time, it will be Adams who comes to earth with a bump.</p>",

Given QPR's plight, second from bottom of the First Division, today's tie is a rare return to the high life for the versatile, articulate Irishman. \"That's a great memory,\" he says of the Parma match. \"It was a good game to play in and we came through it when we weren't expected to win. I'd be the first to admit the squad then didn't have the ability or the talent the one now does but we were organised with George and tactically for the Parma game he got things spot on. \"We got an early goal [through Alan Smith] and defended well for the rest of the match. George played to the players' strengths but I think we got unfair criticism that we were a long-ball team, didn't pass as much as we should have done and all the rest.\" Morrow is one of four former Arsenal players at QPR, joining Chris Kiwomya, Matthew Rose and Lee Harper, yet of them all he might feel the change of career direction most acutely. He turned down Premiership offers to go to Loftus Road and expected a quick return to the top flight. When he arrived the team featured Trevor Sinclair, Andrew Impey, John Spencer and Danny Dichio among others. Now, after severe financial cutbacks caused by annual losses of around \u00a38m, Morrow is surrounded by astute signings such as Stuart Wardley, a one-time removal man, and Jermaine Darlington, who was working as a glazer and turning out for Aylesbury two years ago. \"It was a big wrench to leave Arsenal,\" says Morrow, who still visits the club's training ground. \"It had a lot to do with the fact that Stewart Houston was manager here with Bruce Rioch, and I don't regret it in any way. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger had just taken over and I wasn't playing regularly, so when the offer came up it wasn't too hard a decision. \"When I came here the club were doing well. We just missed out on the play-offs in my first season. Unfortunately, for a number of reasons, it's gone downhill since then but it's been more of a challenge. You can get into a rut some times and hang around being part of a squad.\" Trying to break into the renowned Highbury backline involved more hanging around than even Godot might inflict on anyone. Morrow made his Northern Ireland debut against Uruguay before he had played for Arsenal and appreciates what special mentors he had. \"I wouldn't say it was a doddle coming into the back four now and again when I was really young but it was much easier because there were experienced players around you like David O'Leary and Tony Adams,\" he says. \"They helped me out a hell of a lot. You look out there now for replacements for people like Tony but who is there who can just walk in and fill his shoes?\" With Adams and Co wobbling a little, QPR will fancy their chances, though it seems inconceivable these days that they finished above Arsenal in 1993 and 1995. Their manager Gerry Francis, a man twice sounded out by England, does not even watch Premiership matches now, instead taping lower-division games and taking himself to non-league grounds. Morrow hopes a rare release from the pressure of fighting relegation will inspire QPR and he is due a turn in fortune after missing much of last season with a shoulder injury. It does, he admits, upset him a little that his cup-final goal tends to get forgotten because of the crash landing that followed. If he gets the winner this time, it will be Adams who comes to earth with a bump.",

Frankly, after years of kneecapping and random bombing, Sinn Fein's image could use a bit of a makeover. Perhaps he could help the political wing of the IRA discover its softer, more reassuring side. Tough on informers, but also tough on the causes of informers.

And those voters who are now the greatest worry for Labour are not more likely to abstain now that he resigned. There aren't many ex-miners in Barnsley saying: \"Well I were goin' t'vote Labour, but now that Mandelson's gone, there's not one member of t' government who's a friend of Charles and Camilla.\" Perhaps this is why Tony Blair feels able to let him go. In any case, to paraphrase Lady Bracknell, to lose one ministerial job is unfortunate. To lose two is just carelessness. It does have to be said that the standards we have come to expect from our ministers are far higher than those the rest of us pursue. You don't get Gary from accounts resigning because two years ago he took home some Post It notes and then subsequently denied it. \"On News at Ten tonight, the Post It note scandal continues. Did Gary's friend play solitaire on his computer during office hours?\" Yes, Peter Mandelson acted inappropriately and tried to deny it, but compared to the Archers and the Aitkens, the Hamiltons and the Asil Nadirs, none of Labour's scandals would make the top 40. But now Mandelson's career is in an even bigger mess than his hair was when he walked out of Downing Street. That's not to say that he has nothing left to offer British politics. His contacts in Northern Ireland and his experience of political rebranding could offer new opportunities. Frankly, after years of kneecapping and random bombing, Sinn Fein's image could use a bit of a makeover. Perhaps he could help the political wing of the IRA discover its softer, more reassuring side. Tough on informers, but also tough on the causes of informers. Focus groups could be used to discover that black balaclavas and Armalite rifles were not going down very well with Daily Mail readers in the key marginals. New Sinn Fein - yes, it has a certain ring to it. comment@theguardian.com",

A former adviser to the billionaire brothers explained the brothers' attitude to politicians, revealing that the Hindujas see them \"as a commodity to trade with\".</p> <p>Mr Byers, the trade secretary, authorised publication of the list as officials, mindful of how Peter Mandelson's evasiveness cost him his career, insisted that the department wanted to be open.</p> <p>The two brothers at the centre of the passport row, who are now being questioned by Indian police investigating an arms deal, arranged 13 meetings in less than two years with three named ministers - and also saw them at countless other events.</p> <p>Mr Byers even paid a visit to the Cambridge academic institute founded in memory of SP's only son, Dharam, who in 1999 set fire to himself and his Anglo-Indian Catholic wife.</p> <p>Any of the ministers could face serious problems if the list proves inaccurate - and other departments will face pressure to compile their own versions as the spotlight turns on the networking of Britain's richest Asian family.</p> <p>Contacts continued even after October 2000 when it became known that the Indian police wanted to question them over kickbacks in the Bofors scandal.</p> <p>Mr Byers met SP and GP at the DTI on April 14 1999; attended a reception at their New Zealand House HQ on September 22 1999; spoke on the phone to GP on October 27 1999; met SP and GP again at the DTI on November 24 1999; spoke to GP during the Cambridge visit on October 4 2000; and saw GP at the DTI on November 25 2000.</p> <p>Ms Hewitt visited the home of SP and GP with the British high commissioner during a Treasury trip to India in February 1999; had lunch with SP at his London home on July 7 1999; spoke after she moved to the DTI on the phone to GP on July 26 2000; and met GP at the DTI on July 31 2000.</p> <p>Richard Caborn, like Ms Hewitt a minister of state, met SP and GP at the DTI on March 21 2000.</p> <p>The DTI added ministers had hosted or attended a series of events at which one or both brothers were present, including a speech by Mr Byers to an Asian Trader anniversary dinner on November 14 2000, and a visit to Oldbury's Balaji temple in the West Midlands on April 30 1999.</p> <p>All contact, maintained the DTI, was to discuss ministerial responsibilities and departmental business - not passports. That was the topic that cost Mr Mandelson so dear as his approaches on behalf of SP, while soliciting cash for the millennium dome, led to him misleading voters and Downing Street and paying the ultimate political price.</p> <p>As Tony Blair agreed to the widening of Sir Anthony Hammond's inquiry to cover the Hindujas' passport applications, and as Europe minister Keith Vaz was fighting for his political life, other politicians admitted links to the brothers.</p> <p>Robin Cook has met the brothers as prominent members of the Asian community but says he was not involved in anything to do with their passport applications.</p> <p>\"We are not aware of any involvement by the foreign secretary on this issue,\" said a foreign office spokesman.</p> <p>The Foreign Office also disclosed that Peter Hain, who was moved to the energy portfolio this week in the reshuffle triggered by Mr Mandelson's fall, met the brothers last Christmas when they went to his official drinks party despite not being on the official invitation list.</p> <p>A spokesman for the former prime minister Sir Edward Heath, who has known the family 20 years and helped GP Hinduja with his passport application, confirmed he received \"a couple of thousand pounds\" from the brothers in late 1994 or early 1995 which he put towards the running costs of his Old Bexley and Sidcup constituency office.</p> <p>\"Sir Edward cannot remember the exact date. The payment was for the constituency rather than himself. We cannot find the correspondence and Sir Edward's memory is a little shaky about something six years ago,\" he said.</p> <p>The sensitivity among ministers over past contacts that excited no interest then but could now threaten careers has created panic in Westminster and Whitehall.</p> <p>Ms Hewitt, tipped as a future cabinet minister, came close on Thursday night to repeating Mr Mandelson's error when she attempted to play down links with the Hinduja brothers before confirming she visited their Bombay home.</p> <p>Through a spokesman, the Hindujas said they had not donated money directly to the Hindujas, but they financially supported all three parties by bidding at fund-raising auctions held by the parties.</p> <p>Barry Gardiner, the Labour MP for Brent North, confirmed the Hindujas sponsored an event in honour of the Labour Friends of India, which he chairs.</p> <p>GP Hinduja hosted a dinner at St James' Hotel in London last year for a group of Labour MPs after they returned from a trip to India.</p> <p>The Hindujas yesterday fired their public relations firm after tabloid revelations that their PR man, Howell James, was a former partner of Peter Mandelson's boyfriend, Reinaldo da Silva.</p> <p>The brothers have hired Luther Pendragon to represent them, a firm which specialises in crises. It previously tried to improve the image of McDonald's during its libel case and British Beef after the BSE crisis. Charles Stuart-Smith, the new spokesman for the Hindujas, said: \"They've been to political party functions at which they've made auction bids for pictures and things like that, to all parties.\"</p> <p>Mr Stuart-Smith said the brothers were at the Kumbh Mela in India. After speaking to them he said: \"They sounded very spritely and in very good form. They're surprised at the escalation of events.\"</p> <p>An increasingly frustrated Mr Blair, angry that attempts to focus on issues such as the economy and education have been completely overshadowed by the affair, tried to bolster Keith Vaz's position yesterday during a trip to north east England.</p> <p>\"When the media gets into one of these feeding frenzies this is what happens,\" he said.</p> <p>\"I have to say that, having a look at the papers I've seen, I can't see anything wrong with the things that are supposed to have been done.\"</p> <p>But with an inquiry under way, the affair is unlikely to die down just yet.</p> <p>A former adviser to the Hindujas in Britain explained their thinking in courting politicians.</p> <p>\"They see no difference between Britain and India, politicians are no different, they are commodities that you trade with,\" he said.</p> <p>The ex-aide, who also knows Mr Vaz, added: \"Keith is well-meaning and sometimes abused by people around him. Keith will always try to help anyone - he is a good-natured sort and that is misinterpreted as venal.\"</p>",

A former adviser to the billionaire brothers explained the brothers' attitude to politicians, revealing that the Hindujas see them \"as a commodity to trade with\". Mr Byers, the trade secretary, authorised publication of the list as officials, mindful of how Peter Mandelson's evasiveness cost him his career, insisted that the department wanted to be open. The two brothers at the centre of the passport row, who are now being questioned by Indian police investigating an arms deal, arranged 13 meetings in less than two years with three named ministers - and also saw them at countless other events. Mr Byers even paid a visit to the Cambridge academic institute founded in memory of SP's only son, Dharam, who in 1999 set fire to himself and his Anglo-Indian Catholic wife. Any of the ministers could face serious problems if the list proves inaccurate - and other departments will face pressure to compile their own versions as the spotlight turns on the networking of Britain's richest Asian family. Contacts continued even after October 2000 when it became known that the Indian police wanted to question them over kickbacks in the Bofors scandal. Mr Byers met SP and GP at the DTI on April 14 1999; attended a reception at their New Zealand House HQ on September 22 1999; spoke on the phone to GP on October 27 1999; met SP and GP again at the DTI on November 24 1999; spoke to GP during the Cambridge visit on October 4 2000; and saw GP at the DTI on November 25 2000. Ms Hewitt visited the home of SP and GP with the British high commissioner during a Treasury trip to India in February 1999; had lunch with SP at his London home on July 7 1999; spoke after she moved to the DTI on the phone to GP on July 26 2000; and met GP at the DTI on July 31 2000. Richard Caborn, like Ms Hewitt a minister of state, met SP and GP at the DTI on March 21 2000. The DTI added ministers had hosted or attended a series of events at which one or both brothers were present, including a speech by Mr Byers to an Asian Trader anniversary dinner on November 14 2000, and a visit to Oldbury's Balaji temple in the West Midlands on April 30 1999. All contact, maintained the DTI, was to discuss ministerial responsibilities and departmental business - not passports. That was the topic that cost Mr Mandelson so dear as his approaches on behalf of SP, while soliciting cash for the millennium dome, led to him misleading voters and Downing Street and paying the ultimate political price. As Tony Blair agreed to the widening of Sir Anthony Hammond's inquiry to cover the Hindujas' passport applications, and as Europe minister Keith Vaz was fighting for his political life, other politicians admitted links to the brothers. Robin Cook has met the brothers as prominent members of the Asian community but says he was not involved in anything to do with their passport applications. \"We are not aware of any involvement by the foreign secretary on this issue,\" said a foreign office spokesman. The Foreign Office also disclosed that Peter Hain, who was moved to the energy portfolio this week in the reshuffle triggered by Mr Mandelson's fall, met the brothers last Christmas when they went to his official drinks party despite not being on the official invitation list. A spokesman for the former prime minister Sir Edward Heath, who has known the family 20 years and helped GP Hinduja with his passport application, confirmed he received \"a couple of thousand pounds\" from the brothers in late 1994 or early 1995 which he put towards the running costs of his Old Bexley and Sidcup constituency office. \"Sir Edward cannot remember the exact date. The payment was for the constituency rather than himself. We cannot find the correspondence and Sir Edward's memory is a little shaky about something six years ago,\" he said. The sensitivity among ministers over past contacts that excited no interest then but could now threaten careers has created panic in Westminster and Whitehall. Ms Hewitt, tipped as a future cabinet minister, came close on Thursday night to repeating Mr Mandelson's error when she attempted to play down links with the Hinduja brothers before confirming she visited their Bombay home. Through a spokesman, the Hindujas said they had not donated money directly to the Hindujas, but they financially supported all three parties by bidding at fund-raising auctions held by the parties. Barry Gardiner, the Labour MP for Brent North, confirmed the Hindujas sponsored an event in honour of the Labour Friends of India, which he chairs. GP Hinduja hosted a dinner at St James' Hotel in London last year for a group of Labour MPs after they returned from a trip to India. The Hindujas yesterday fired their public relations firm after tabloid revelations that their PR man, Howell James, was a former partner of Peter Mandelson's boyfriend, Reinaldo da Silva. The brothers have hired Luther Pendragon to represent them, a firm which specialises in crises. It previously tried to improve the image of McDonald's during its libel case and British Beef after the BSE crisis. Charles Stuart-Smith, the new spokesman for the Hindujas, said: \"They've been to political party functions at which they've made auction bids for pictures and things like that, to all parties.\" Mr Stuart-Smith said the brothers were at the Kumbh Mela in India. After speaking to them he said: \"They sounded very spritely and in very good form. They're surprised at the escalation of events.\" An increasingly frustrated Mr Blair, angry that attempts to focus on issues such as the economy and education have been completely overshadowed by the affair, tried to bolster Keith Vaz's position yesterday during a trip to north east England. \"When the media gets into one of these feeding frenzies this is what happens,\" he said. \"I have to say that, having a look at the papers I've seen, I can't see anything wrong with the things that are supposed to have been done.\" But with an inquiry under way, the affair is unlikely to die down just yet. A former adviser to the Hindujas in Britain explained their thinking in courting politicians. \"They see no difference between Britain and India, politicians are no different, they are commodities that you trade with,\" he said. The ex-aide, who also knows Mr Vaz, added: \"Keith is well-meaning and sometimes abused by people around him. Keith will always try to help anyone - he is a good-natured sort and that is misinterpreted as venal.\"",

      "body": "<p>Israel has existed for 52 years. It would surely by now be as secure a nation-state as any other but for the way it came into existence. As a response to European anti-semitism, Zionism may have been a very special, high-minded kind of European colonialism but, in its consequences for an indigenous people, it was as bad as any other.</p> <p>The settler-state to which it gave birth has also been very special, indeed unique, in that it continues to exist at all. All other such polities have disappeared during European decolonisation. Those who peopled them have either been driven out in a bloody liberation war or yielded their political supremacy to majority rule.</p> <p>The supreme measure of this success has been the official acceptance of its right to exist the enterprise eventually won from its indigenous victims. The achievement is all the more remarkable in that these victims are not just the Palestinians, who were directly dispossessed in the ethnic cleansing that accompanied Israel's birth, but a much larger community, the Arabs, who identified with them in their anti-colonial struggle.</p> <p>There were always rejectionists in the region, now most potently typified by Hamas or Hizbullah, but the dominant players are accepters. Their acceptance is an accomplished fact in the case of Egypt and Jordan, who have made formal peace with Israel; it remains an intent with Palestine, Syria and Lebanon, who have yet to do so. But all subscribe to a broad consensus of what constitutes a \"just, lasting and comprehensive\" settlement.</p> <p>Clearly, however, the success cannot be permanently assured until those for whom acceptance is still an intent convert it into an accomplished fact. Short of that, the risk is not merely that the enterprise will remain incomplete; it is that, sooner or later, the success it has achieved will be challenged and, in the end, instead of its consolidation as the great exception in the annals of European colonialism, it will suffer the same fate as all the rest.</p> <p>The al-Aqsa intifada has the makings of that challenge. It is no accident that it erupted just when, on the face of it, Zionism's ultimate triumph had come within its grasp. The Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, had laid his historic, take-it-or-leave-it compromise before the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, at Camp David in July. In return for \"generous concessions\" by Israel, the Palestinians were to have renounced all further claims on it. He failed, because the concessions fell so far short of the Arab-Palestinian accepters' consensus.</p> <p>At the heart of the consensus is a Palestinian state, with Jerusalem as its capital, in the West Bank and Gaza. Mr Arafat first proclaimed it in 1988, and in the 1993 Oslo agreement, he agreed to work towards it through a series of \"interim\" arrangements paving the way for \"final status\". Though it was the fruit of Arab/Palestinian weakness, the offer was by any reckoning a magnanimous one. Mr Arafat had begun his career at the head of a \"popular liberation struggle\" whose objective had been full recovery of the homeland and dismantling of the settler-state. Here he was offering to yield up a full 78% of original Palestine. But throughout the \"interim\" stages, Israel spurned the offer.</p> <p>In the Camp David \"final-status\" talks Mr Barak may have ceded more than ever before, but he was still demanding much more than the 78%, plus a whole array of other gains, ideological or security-related, making the compromise even more imbalanced than the one the Arab-Palestinian consensus had already acquiesced in. From this Israeli rejection grew the intifada. To what extent Mr Barak triggered it for his own ends, or Mr Arafat manipulated it for his, is detail. To the Palestinians, its purpose has become clear. This is their \"war of independence\".</p> <p>Liberal Israelis liken it to their own of 52 years ago. \"The tanzim [young Palestinian fighters],\" forecast one, \"will no more demobilise before Israel recognises the borders of the Palestine state than the pre-1948 Jewish underground would have done before Israel was established.\"</p> <p>The Palestinians have therefore regressed, in some degree, to the methods with which Mr Arafat began his career. But their aims are still essentially Oslo by other means. Hamas, believers in \"complete liberation\", have ceded the main role to Mr Arafat's Fatah. And Fatah proclaims no ambitions beyond that 22%. It wants its state to co-exist with Israel, not to destroy it. But can this restraint withstand the rising violence, passions and chaos that the intifada threatens to unleash?</p> <p>The first instinct of colonial regimes is to react to indigenous violence with a more effective violence of their own. Israel enjoys military superiority over its adversaries. Just how long it would need to reconquer the territories is little more than a question of tactics, and its strength makes it more than a match for any combination of Arab armies. Zionism has been fashioned by its most dramatic military exploits; two wars - 1948 and 1967 - were brilliantly successful. The intifada has brought Israel psychologically close to some new such exploit. To listen to the rhetoric is to grasp the depth of the temptation to go for the absolute solution which such military superiority presents.</p> <p>It says, in effect, that Israel again faces an existential threat. It contends that the Palestinians never changed, their aim is still to \"drive the Jews into the sea\" and, for Mr Arafat, the peace process is just a means of \"dismantling Israel in stages\".</p> <p>\"Let the army win,\" is the rallying cry of the settlers and their political allies.What that really means, says Zeev Schiff, military analyst of Ha'aretz newspaper, is \"the conquest of the territories under Palestinian control, the forced collapse of the Palestinian Authority and the expulsion of the Palestinian population\".</p> <p>According to the same newspaper, the deputy chief of staff, Moshe Ya'alon, thinks in rather apocalyptic terms. Israel, he argues, is now engaged in \"the most critical campaign against the Palestinians, including Israel's Arab population, since the 1948 war\"; indeed, it is \"the second half of 1948\". Given that, in the first half, Israel committed the original sin from which all its troubles ultimately stem, what the second half might bring is a necessarily grim surmise.</p> <p>It would also very likely lead to a regional war. Because of the wider Arab identification with Palestine, the arena in which Israel's \"deterrent power\" must apply \"does not\" - as one commentator put it - \"begin and end at the Netzarim Junction [in Gaza], but extends from Tehran to Damascus and Cairo.\"</p> <p>But regional war could prove disastrously counter-productive. At the least, it would defer for a generation any prospect of Israel's final acceptance in the region. At worst it would create the existential threat it was supposed to ward off.</p> <p>Among its possible consequences: Iraq would complete its comeback in the region as the standard-bearer of rejectionism; turmoil in Jordan would force King Abdullah to repudiate the peace treaty with Israel; the US would forsake Israel in a bid to rescue what is left of its influence in the region, and if it failed to do so Saudi Arabia would unsheath the oil weapon; it would sap Israel's cohesion.</p> <p>Yet Israel is now less likely than ever to achieve acceptance through negotiation. If that was going to happen, it would have done so before the intifada broke out. Now, after so much blood, Mr Arafat cannot sell his people's sacrifices short. And the concessions Mr Barak can sell to Israel are even fewer than they might have been, for society has shifted rightwards.</p> <p>The only alternative is what is already happening: a low-intensity war of attrition waged against a background of diplomatic deadlock. Some believe it could go on for years. Israel will presumably persist in its tactics: selective attacks on personnel and installations, harassment, economic blockade, designed to weaken the Palestinians to the point where they return on Israel's terms to negotiations.</p> <p>But who will weary first? The pain the Palestinians are enduring is infinitely greater, but so is their capacity to endure it. Accustomed to privation and imbued with hatred of Israeli oppression, they face an adversary which has largely forgotten the self-denying zeal of its pioneering years, which quit \"the mud\" of south Lebanon because it was losing about 20 dead a year - and has lost 47 in three-and-a-half months of intifada.</p> <p>The longer this struggle goes on, the more the Palestinians will perceive any Israeli retreats as weakness. The more weakness, the more retreats they will press for, to the point where they will be tempted to regress to their original goals. The rejectionists already think this way. But for the still-dominant accepters, there is still a way to save themselves and Israel from all-out conflict; the formation of an American-led \"fact-finding commission\" was a first, timid pointer towards it.</p> <p>There must be, they say, international - as opposed to merely American - sponsorship of an historic compromise; and it must if necessary be imposed by force. This is seen as not merely practicable, but historically proper too. Israel has made it plain that it would resist any encroachment on its sovereignty. But the record shows that it was the child of the UN, that the general assembly's 1947 Partition resolution was the founding charter of its international legitimacy, and that it formally acknowledged that its sovereignty was subordinate to a higher obligation - internationally sponsored redress for the Palestinians.</p> <p>Such an outcome is a long way off yet. Meanwhile, argues the Jordanian columnist Rami Khouri, the longer the intifada continues, \"the more self-evident it becomes that the underlying policy of colonial occupation - outdated, counter-productive, morally and politically rejected by the entire world - is unsustainable and nearing its end\". But, if so, what end? One that, through international fiat, preserves this last great exception in the history of European colonialism - or one that ends the exception itself?</p>",

      "body": "<p>It takes one - truistically - to know one and I'm afraid he could not have been queenier if he tried. The tousled locks, the quivering lower lip, the nostrils poised to flare: all signalled a gay at bay. This was a camp High Noon. But it was that \"fuck you\" look in the eyes that compelled as he looked into the cruel lens - for there one saw contempt for the spirits he had conjured out of the media shallows. Lunching with journalists may be less fun than feasting with panthers - but by such means the necromancer had risen. Now they had him in their maws. And so he blamed them for their appetites.</p> <p>The beguiler's fall has no significance in the politics of thought. The heterosexual commentating heavies miss the Mandelson point. Which is why they're bemused by the folly of the telephone call on the wild side, the silly daring of that two-minute surrender of judgment. What Peter Mandelson did was the political equivalent of bare-backing. And as with all such discovered episodes of unprotected sex, it's the presumption of further unrevealed audacity which thrills both voyeur and victim. How many other times did he do it? Whether his departure makes the euro more or less likely really seems rather boring by comparison.</p> <p>Tony Blair invokes Peter Mandelson's place in the great sweep of history. He might be a subject for a thesis on the role of the courtier in democratic culture, but little more. New Labour - the provisional arrangement he fathered - looks strangely pass\u00e9 as Labour finally settles in as a government. No - Peter Mandelson's real significance is other. This is a gay thing - the story of a man who politically was once one man's bitch and then became another's.</p> <p>The Mandelson manner and appearance (arch, equivocal, layered in suggestive meaning), was a historically specific product. It came from the gender-bendering 80s when there was enough liberation around to step outside the closet, but not enough for the orthodox careerist to swing the door behind him.</p> <p>Older gays, such as the travel writer Gavin Young who died earlier this month, arrived at a different accommodation with the genes. Enjoying the homosexuality traditional among Arabists of his class and generation, Gavin travelled for it. But at home it was drinks at the Cavalry Club and dinner at Pratt's. He was an old-school masculine gay - the kind who embraced physical toughness in travel as an affirmation of character. No \"fem\" he. Conventional thought - both pro and anti gay - would have judged him \"repressed\" but though racked by self-doubt he sailed through life with discipline and flair. Most schools have a PE teacher or two who, liking \"lads who keep themselves fit\", are rather similar.</p> <p>The interim ethics of Mandy-gaydom seems a sadder thing. The fact that he never acknowledged his gayness only confirmed a reputation for deceit. And in politics the coat fashioned for you by others can slip on all too easily, until the day arrives when you suddenly look in the mirror. As the most famous gay man in Britain he was a cardboard cut-out figure, the political Village People's Machiavelli, a parody of the gay man as the shifty fudge-packer in the corner. He had fed meat in his time to the political vultures of the Sun and the Daily Mail. But Mandy-gayness also suited their caricaturing homophobic purposes.</p> <p>The party he chose found him exotic - which says more about that party's Methodist dullness than it does about the Hendon boy. Chris Smith and Nick Brown show how in New Labour even the gay men are strait-laced. Old Labour had a brave stab at it all with Tom Driberg - a cruiser of ocean-going capacity but there have been no worthy successors to that prodigy of the cottage epiphanies. That Tories are camper is a law of British politics. But campery is the carapace of repression, put in place to release what might otherwise be anarchic.</p> <p>Cod psychology tries to explain the gay fascination with politics as a question of tatty operetta charms, charged emotions and episodic fits of drama, of quarrels and reconciliations. The queeny stereotype is pre- \"post-gay\" and reveals a present partial truth. Perhaps when everything turns \"virtually normal\" we'll all be living on joint mortgages shared with accountants in Barnstable.

      "bodyText": "It takes one - truistically - to know one and I'm afraid he could not have been queenier if he tried. The tousled locks, the quivering lower lip, the nostrils poised to flare: all signalled a gay at bay. This was a camp High Noon. But it was that \"fuck you\" look in the eyes that compelled as he looked into the cruel lens - for there one saw contempt for the spirits he had conjured out of the media shallows. Lunching with journalists may be less fun than feasting with panthers - but by such means the necromancer had risen. Now they had him in their maws. And so he blamed them for their appetites. The beguiler's fall has no significance in the politics of thought. The heterosexual commentating heavies miss the Mandelson point. Which is why they're bemused by the folly of the telephone call on the wild side, the silly daring of that two-minute surrender of judgment. What Peter Mandelson did was the political equivalent of bare-backing. And as with all such discovered episodes of unprotected sex, it's the presumption of further unrevealed audacity which thrills both voyeur and victim. How many other times did he do it? Whether his departure makes the euro more or less likely really seems rather boring by comparison. Tony Blair invokes Peter Mandelson's place in the great sweep of history. He might be a subject for a thesis on the role of the courtier in democratic culture, but little more. New Labour - the provisional arrangement he fathered - looks strangely pass\u00e9 as Labour finally settles in as a government. No - Peter Mandelson's real significance is other. This is a gay thing - the story of a man who politically was once one man's bitch and then became another's. The Mandelson manner and appearance (arch, equivocal, layered in suggestive meaning), was a historically specific product. It came from the gender-bendering 80s when there was enough liberation around to step outside the closet, but not enough for the orthodox careerist to swing the door behind him. Older gays, such as the travel writer Gavin Young who died earlier this month, arrived at a different accommodation with the genes. Enjoying the homosexuality traditional among Arabists of his class and generation, Gavin travelled for it. But at home it was drinks at the Cavalry Club and dinner at Pratt's. He was an old-school masculine gay - the kind who embraced physical toughness in travel as an affirmation of character. No \"fem\" he. Conventional thought - both pro and anti gay - would have judged him \"repressed\" but though racked by self-doubt he sailed through life with discipline and flair. Most schools have a PE teacher or two who, liking \"lads who keep themselves fit\", are rather similar. The interim ethics of Mandy-gaydom seems a sadder thing. The fact that he never acknowledged his gayness only confirmed a reputation for deceit. And in politics the coat fashioned for you by others can slip on all too easily, until the day arrives when you suddenly look in the mirror. As the most famous gay man in Britain he was a cardboard cut-out figure, the political Village People's Machiavelli, a parody of the gay man as the shifty fudge-packer in the corner. He had fed meat in his time to the political vultures of the Sun and the Daily Mail. But Mandy-gayness also suited their caricaturing homophobic purposes. The party he chose found him exotic - which says more about that party's Methodist dullness than it does about the Hendon boy. Chris Smith and Nick Brown show how in New Labour even the gay men are strait-laced. Old Labour had a brave stab at it all with Tom Driberg - a cruiser of ocean-going capacity but there have been no worthy successors to that prodigy of the cottage epiphanies. That Tories are camper is a law of British politics. But campery is the carapace of repression, put in place to release what might otherwise be anarchic. Cod psychology tries to explain the gay fascination with politics as a question of tatty operetta charms, charged emotions and episodic fits of drama, of quarrels and reconciliations. The queeny stereotype is pre- \"post-gay\" and reveals a present partial truth. Perhaps when everything turns \"virtually normal\" we'll all be living on joint mortgages shared with accountants in Barnstable. But for the moment gay life has an existentialist quality with its choices of the moment. Perhaps - as one who can't see a collectivity without wanting to run away - I romanticise. But politics appeals to gay men for two reasons, both of them dangerous. Like sex, religion and drugs, politics seems to confirm the self. It gives it a platform of heightened self- importance. But all four are also an escape from the burdensome real self - the one you have to deal with on a daily basis. Their dangerous attraction is the offer of absorption in something greater. Political groupings are often substitute families for gay politicians - hence the virulence of the squabbling.

      "bodyText": "President George Bush and his brother Jeb, the governor of Florida, have been set on a political collision course by plans to extend oil and natural gas drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. The new president arrived in office on a pledge to extend oil drilling rights, in an effort to make the United States self-sufficient in energy and avoid power supply crises like that affecting California. But Jeb Bush has written to his brother's new administration calling on it to abandon the efforts begun by the Clinton administration to open up more of the eastern Gulf of Mexico to offshore drilling near the Florida coast. The brothers are at odds because George Bush's presidential campaign was heavily backed by oil interests which are now looking for a return in the form of easier drilling rights in the Gulf, off the California coast, and in Alaska. Jeb Bush, meanwhile, is facing a bitter re-election battle in November 2002 which will be dominated by the aftermath of the presidential election crisis in Florida. He is struggling to rebuild his popularity with the voters. The governor is looking for support from the state's environmental lobby, which has made the protection of Florida's famous beaches, one of the most important attractions in the state, whose economy is heavily dependent on tourism, a top priority. New offshore drilling is opposed by the Republicans and the Democrats in Florida, but Governor Bush clearly fears that he would take the blame if his brother's administration gives the go-ahead. At issue in the stand-off is the future of a plan, put forward by the US department of the interior, to auction the drilling rights to 2.4m hectares (5.9m acres) of sea bed in the Gulf of Mexico, known as \"Sale 181\". The area is divided into more than 1,000 separate blocks in a region \"which contains potentially significant oil and gas resources that are largely unexplored\", according to the department. The area runs south from the Alabama coast, and most of the blocks are at least 100 miles from the Florida panhandle coast and more than 200 miles west of Tampa's shores. If approved, it will be the first new drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico since 1988. Among the bidders are likely to be the three oil multinationals - Chevron, Conaco and Murphy Oil - already drilling in other areas of the eastern Gulf. All three corporations gave money to George Bush's presidential campaign and to other Republican election funds. \"Florida's economy is based upon tourism and other activities that depend on a clean and healthy environment,\" Jeb Bush wrote in his letter this week. \"I am confident that the new administration will recognise the need to protect sensitive natural resources located both offshore and along Florida's coastline for the benefit of the entire nation.\" He told reporters in Tallahassee yesterday; \"These are leases that are close to Florida waters and I think it's appropriate for the Florida governor to represent Florida's interests in that regard.\" His intervention was welcomed by local environmental campaigners. \"The governor is very strong against drilling, but he has not gone this far before,\" Mark Ferrulo, a spokesman for the Florida Public Interest Research Group, said. \"It's one of the most unifying issues in Florida, and there aren't that many of those right now.\" The stand-off will be an early test of President Bush's nominee at the interior department, Gale Norton. Her nomination caused consternation among environmentalists because of her record of strong support for new exploration and exploitation of natural resources, including a statement that property owners could have \"a right to pollute\". At her confirmation hearings in Washington last week, however, Ms Norton disarmed her critics by disavowing and reversing many of her previous stands on environmental issues, including the \"right to pollute\" comment. Though Friends of the Earth continues to dub her \"a wolf in sheep's clothing,\" her nomination was approved 18-2 by a Senate committee on Wednesday, and is now waiting for full Senate approval. \u0095 President Bush will meet the the prime minister, Tony Blair, next month, the White House announced yesterday.

Restaurants are notorious for unrequested starters, inflated cover charges, and accidental additions to the bill. These are anecdotes. Many counter-examples exist, of dropped wallets handed in to police stations, magnanimous taxi drivers and kindness towards strangers, but there is no denying the perception that Rome squirms with crooks. Surveys repeatedly show it to be one of Europe's safest cities, with relatively low rates of burglary and mugging, yet there is something about the attitude here which suggests the poor image is deserved. It is not that fleecing is widespread so much as the accompanying glee. Tourists in a feelgood haze may not notice. Not so other Italians. They say the emblem SPQR stands not for senatus populusque Romanus (\"the senate and people of Rome\") but sono porci, questi Romani (\"they are pigs these Romans\"). Some historians suggest that Romans are conditioned to opportunism by centuries of tyranny, invasion, poverty and uncertainty. Others say the cause is more recent, the product of breakneck growth since being woken from a provincial snooze in 1871 to become the newly unified country's capital. For all their bragging about imperial ancestry most Roman families are new arrivals, here for less than two generations, so they lack the rootedness which is said to give other Italians a stronger civic spirit. Romans would not be Romans if they did not shrug off such hostility as ingratitude. Were it not for their pulsing energy the city, not an easy place to live in, would become a sterile tourist theme park. They feel entitled to some payback.",

She says she has taped accounts from three witnesses who say that Mr Fischer had called for the use of violence.</p> <p>\"He was the criteria for the violence,\" says Ms R\u00f6hl. \"But cleverly he remained the \u00e9minence grise who managed to appear to not get his hands dirty.\"</p> <p>She dismisses his claims that he turned his back on violence in 1977. \"There are plenty of witnesses I have on tape who say that from his days as a Frankfurt radical, through to his rise through the Green party in the 1980s, Mr Fischer has always had his bully boys who would come in and beat up his opponents or anyone standing in his way. It's too late for him to claim he's changed.\"</p> <p>Mr Fischer's past keeps coming back to haunt him. Allegations surfaced last weekend that he had given refuge to the RAF terrorist Margrit Schiller in his Frankfurt apartment. Last week he gave evidence at the murder trial of his former friend, Hans-Joachim Klein, who abandoned Mr Fischer's radical group in favour of hardcore terrorism.</p> <p>Ms R\u00f6hl says that the foreign minister, who has apologised for his past, is one of thousands of Germans suffering from the \"Baader-Meinhof complex\". \"It's in the heads of many those who are traumatised by the roles they played during the student demonstrations, and all the more so because they are horrified by the recognition that they enjoyed the violence and are somehow nostalgic for it.\"</p> <p>And she claims Mr Fischer's metamorphosis is deceptive. She interviewed him in 1998, before he was foreign minister, during research for a book. \"I knew then that he had been a 1970s demonstrator, but knew nothing of the serious role he had really played. I simply wanted to interview him as a politician, and had my questions prepared.</p> <p>\"But he didn't let me ask any questions. He treated me as if I was Ulrike Meinhof reincarnated, and he wanted to defend the role he had played in the scene. With his eyes closed, he seemed to go on a nostalgia trip and said: 'I certainly wasn't unviolent', and got quite cross when I tried to brush the subject aside. He wanted me to see him as a hero of the 70s.\"</p> <p>Mr Fischer and Meinhof belonged to different radical circles in Frankfurt, Meinhof to the RAF, Mr Fischer to the Marxist \"Cleaning Brigade\".</p> <p>Ms R\u00f6hl said: \"They didn t know each other, but I've come across a letter from my mother written from prison, where she requests the text of a speech given in 1972 by someone from the Revolutionary Fight [RK] in which it was said that the battle of the RAF should be firmly defended. The speech was Fischer's.\"</p> <p>She believes that the support shown to Mr Fischer is evidence of a propaganda campaign which intends to \"play up the crimes of the right in order to cover up the crimes of the left\".</p> <p>\"Of course, it's necessary to fight against the far right, but an exaggerated view of the right is portrayed, which serves the left very well, providing figures like Fischer with a veil behind which to hide and there's a type of brain-washing at play.\"</p> <p>While Mr Fischer s life story reads like a thriller, Ms R\u00f6hl's early life was equally dramatic. She was reluctant to elaborate on her childhood yesterday. But she has described life at home in the 70s, along with her twin Regine - now a Hamburg doctor - as \"like living in a constant state of emergency\".</p> <p>Her childhood was punctuated by traumatic events: her parents' divorce when she was seven; Meinhof's escape underground when her children were eight; the sisters' abduction to Sicily for four months; Meinhof's arrest for murder when the girls were 10, and an imprisonment during which they saw her only a handful of times before she hanged herself in 1976.</p> <p>But an analysis of Ms R\u00f6hl s current actions in the light of her past deeply anger her. \"I now have the feeling that I've conquered my past, but that doesn't mean that I'll say the pain was never there. But to say I've redirected that on to Fischer is absurd.\"</p> <p>And she is adamant it is not her past that needs to be scrutinised. \"I'd be happy simply if someone started to look properly at Mr Fischer's past, but the trouble is that the system that should investigate him is riddled with people with similar pasts who today are also very powerful.\"</p>",

She says she has taped accounts from three witnesses who say that Mr Fischer had called for the use of violence. \"He was the criteria for the violence,\" says Ms R\u00f6hl. \"But cleverly he remained the \u00e9minence grise who managed to appear to not get his hands dirty.\" She dismisses his claims that he turned his back on violence in 1977. \"There are plenty of witnesses I have on tape who say that from his days as a Frankfurt radical, through to his rise through the Green party in the 1980s, Mr Fischer has always had his bully boys who would come in and beat up his opponents or anyone standing in his way. It's too late for him to claim he's changed.\" Mr Fischer's past keeps coming back to haunt him. Allegations surfaced last weekend that he had given refuge to the RAF terrorist Margrit Schiller in his Frankfurt apartment. Last week he gave evidence at the murder trial of his former friend, Hans-Joachim Klein, who abandoned Mr Fischer's radical group in favour of hardcore terrorism. Ms R\u00f6hl says that the foreign minister, who has apologised for his past, is one of thousands of Germans suffering from the \"Baader-Meinhof complex\". \"It's in the heads of many those who are traumatised by the roles they played during the student demonstrations, and all the more so because they are horrified by the recognition that they enjoyed the violence and are somehow nostalgic for it.\" And she claims Mr Fischer's metamorphosis is deceptive. She interviewed him in 1998, before he was foreign minister, during research for a book. \"I knew then that he had been a 1970s demonstrator, but knew nothing of the serious role he had really played. I simply wanted to interview him as a politician, and had my questions prepared. \"But he didn't let me ask any questions. He treated me as if I was Ulrike Meinhof reincarnated, and he wanted to defend the role he had played in the scene. With his eyes closed, he seemed to go on a nostalgia trip and said: 'I certainly wasn't unviolent', and got quite cross when I tried to brush the subject aside. He wanted me to see him as a hero of the 70s.\" Mr Fischer and Meinhof belonged to different radical circles in Frankfurt, Meinhof to the RAF, Mr Fischer to the Marxist \"Cleaning Brigade\". Ms R\u00f6hl said: \"They didn t know each other, but I've come across a letter from my mother written from prison, where she requests the text of a speech given in 1972 by someone from the Revolutionary Fight [RK] in which it was said that the battle of the RAF should be firmly defended. The speech was Fischer's.\" She believes that the support shown to Mr Fischer is evidence of a propaganda campaign which intends to \"play up the crimes of the right in order to cover up the crimes of the left\". \"Of course, it's necessary to fight against the far right, but an exaggerated view of the right is portrayed, which serves the left very well, providing figures like Fischer with a veil behind which to hide and there's a type of brain-washing at play.\" While Mr Fischer s life story reads like a thriller, Ms R\u00f6hl's early life was equally dramatic. She was reluctant to elaborate on her childhood yesterday. But she has described life at home in the 70s, along with her twin Regine - now a Hamburg doctor - as \"like living in a constant state of emergency\". Her childhood was punctuated by traumatic events: her parents' divorce when she was seven; Meinhof's escape underground when her children were eight; the sisters' abduction to Sicily for four months; Meinhof's arrest for murder when the girls were 10, and an imprisonment during which they saw her only a handful of times before she hanged herself in 1976. But an analysis of Ms R\u00f6hl s current actions in the light of her past deeply anger her. \"I now have the feeling that I've conquered my past, but that doesn't mean that I'll say the pain was never there. But to say I've redirected that on to Fischer is absurd.\" And she is adamant it is not her past that needs to be scrutinised. \"I'd be happy simply if someone started to look properly at Mr Fischer's past, but the trouble is that the system that should investigate him is riddled with people with similar pasts who today are also very powerful.\"",

      "body": "<p>They remember the Comptons on the Moulsecoomb estate: Ronald, Margaret and their four sons, Ronald jnr, Stephen, Sean and Robert. The family hasn't lived there for 10 years, but mention of it has the effect of a sudden draught, sucking shut doors, delivering a bolt down the spine.</p> <p>\"Look at me, I'm shaking,\" said a resident last week, reminded of the family by news that four of the Compton men had been sentenced to join the fifth in prison. \"They were polite and well mannered, but it's what they brought into the neighbourhood. They moved on and they left the problem here.\"</p> <p>The problem was heroin. At Hove crown court in east Sussex last week, Judge Anthony Scott-Gall ruled that the Compton family business was a \"vile and wicked trade\" of sufficient reach to warrant sentences totalling 21 years.</p> <p>The father, Ronald snr, 58, was convicted of drug trafficking. His \"lieutenants\" Stephen, 38, and Sean, 28, were convicted of conspiracy to supply drugs, and Robert, 36, was found guilty of possessing cash proceeds from drug trafficking. The eldest son, Ronald jnr, 39, is two years into an eight-year sentence for possessing heroin with intent to supply.</p> <p>\"They like to think of themselves as loveable rogues,\" said Detective Inspector Paul Grundy, who lead the inquiry. \"But they are not. They are dealers in death.\"</p> <p>The rise of the Compton family from the privations of Moulsecoomb to the mansions of Brighton's Tongdean neighbourhood is set against the decline of the addicts they supplied. Brighton and Hove has the highest number of heroin-related deaths of any region in the country. In 1999, the figure was over 35; by last June that record had already been beaten.</p> <p>\"It is easier to get a bag of heroin than a cup of tea in Brighton,\" said Neil Ansell, regional manager of the Big Issue. \"Heroin is more available than cannabis. I know of several people who have died of overdoses since the beginning of January.\"</p> <p>\"It is recognised that seaside resorts attract an itinerant population of people with social problems,\" said a spokeswoman for Addaction, the needle exchange and counselling service which since last May has registered an average of 55 addicts a month. To indicate the extent of Brighton's drugs trade, the number of addicts registering at the service's east London branch, is only 40-45 a month. Into this scene came the Comptons, who over two decades would make an estimated \u00a33m from the heroin trade. It is a commonplace of drug dealing that the higher up the supply chain you operate, the less likely you are to be drug-using yourself. The remarkable thing about the Comptons is that despite their seniority, as heroin wholesalers, members of the family were themselves taking drugs and to an extent that threatened to destroy them.</p> <p><b> Salutary effect</b><br></p> <p>In 1993, Robert Compton's wife Alison died from a heroin-related illness; Stephen Compton's partner Jacky died after an overdose of amphetamines. When Sean and Sasha Compton's baby girl was born, it was with an opiate addiction from which she is just now recovering. \"I hope that fact had a salutary effect on you,\" said Judge Scott-Gall while sentencing Sean to four and a half years' imprisonment. Sasha Compton sobbed before retreating to her six bedroom, mock-Tudor house with intercom and video entry facilities.</p> <p>The family business started three miles from the genteel lanes of Tongdean, in Brighton's Moulsecoomb estate, a district marked by the unhappy juxtaposition of frightened pensioners in well-kept houses with squalid dealers' homes bearing the scars of serial efforts to kick the doors in. The police have intelligence tracing the Compton family business back 15 years, to when the sons were teenagers and Ronald snr described himself as an antiques dealer. They did not operate on a grand scale. \"It made me laugh when they described Stephen as the 'banker' in the family,\" said a former neighbour, still fearful enough of recriminations to withhold his name. \"I remember seeing him dealing in broad daylight right outside the shop. But they were a great deal better than what came in after them.\"</p> <p>As the sons grew up, they acquired nominal trades for themselves: Robert was a \"jewellery dealer\"; Sean, despite the mansion and Mercedes he later purchased, identified himself as a \"handyman\"; Stephen followed his father into the \"antiques business\".</p> <p>As the dynasty grew and a steady supply of heroin was secured from London and Liverpool, the Compton parents moved to Woodingdean, a quiet hilltop area overlooking the sea, where Margaret Compton still lives. They began investing in property under the name Comptons of Brighton. Margaret Compton opened a florists in the city centre. \"I did well,\" she said last week, still maintaining the innocence if not of her husband (he pleaded guilty to charges of trafficking), then at least of her sons. \"We paid \u00a389,000 for this house and we've got a mortgage like anyone else. I had a car on hire purchase - now if I was rolling in all this drugs money, why would I do that?\"</p> <p><b> Contaminated</b><br></p> <p>The evidence collated by the intelligence branch of the Sussex police was incontrovertible, however. When Ronald jnr's home was raided three years ago, police found 60kg of cannabis resin with a street value of between \u00a390,000 and \u00a3144,000. They also recovered \u00a313,750 worth of heroin.</p> <p>A year later, under Operation Sun Spot, 50 officers raided the rest of the family's homes and recovered 1.2kg of heroin worth \u00a350,000 and a stash of \u00a3170,000, most of it stuffed into tins of instant potato mix or hidden under floorboards. Some 95% of the notes were contaminated with traces of heroin. It was the biggest seizure in Sussex for 10 years and the end of one of Brighton's most extensive organised crime families.</p> <p>The ripple effect this bust has had on crime figures in Brighton is difficult to quantify. \"There will be a void,\" said Det Insp Grundy, pointing to Home Office figures which indicate that 1kg of heroin generates 220 victims of burglary and \u00a3220,000 worth of stolen property, and that each addicted offender executes somewhere in the region of 100 crimes a month.</p> <p>Drugs charities in Brighton, while applauding police efforts, were slightly more cautious. \"We haven't seen a dip yet,\" said a spokeswoman for Addaction. \"There is no evidence that our clients are finding it more difficult to get supplies. They would be visibly suffering if that were the case. The sad fact is that it doesn't take long for someone else to come in and take over the Comptons' territory.\"</p> <p>\"Arresting the Comptons is a hiccup in the drugs trade,\" said Mr Ansell. \"I have never known an addict in Brighton to say, 'I've been trying all day and I can't get a bag of heroin.' The street dealers will just get their supplies from someone else.\"</p> <p>He added: \"I've known dealers to have been put away in the morning, and by the afternoon, for their mobile phones to have been in use by other dealers who have taken over the good will of the business.\"</p> <p>The demand for heroin in Brighton has pushed prices to \u00a315-\u00a320 for a fraction of a gram and crack has started making an appearance. \"The way we are tackling it is to come down extremely hard on the dealers,\" said Glynn Jones, chief executive of Brighton and Hove council and chair of the Drug and Alcohol Action Team. \"We are coordinating with the health authority, the police and drugs charities to form a consistent approach, and ensure that action taken against dealers is not in conflict with the rehabilitation of users.\" The team is also working with Brighton schools to send in ex-addicts to talk to pupils about the dangers of drug taking.</p> <p>Margaret Compton, meanwhile, continues to plead persecution. Charges of trafficking against her remain on police files and the authorities are seeking to recover the rest of the money made from the business. \"He did a bad thing and he paid for it,\" she said of her husband, before driving the three miles to her daughter-in-law Sasha's house, to help with the newly fatherless grandchildren.</p>",

The family hasn't lived there for 10 years, but mention of it has the effect of a sudden draught, sucking shut doors, delivering a bolt down the spine. \"Look at me, I'm shaking,\" said a resident last week, reminded of the family by news that four of the Compton men had been sentenced to join the fifth in prison. \"They were polite and well mannered, but it's what they brought into the neighbourhood. They moved on and they left the problem here.\" The problem was heroin. At Hove crown court in east Sussex last week, Judge Anthony Scott-Gall ruled that the Compton family business was a \"vile and wicked trade\" of sufficient reach to warrant sentences totalling 21 years. The father, Ronald snr, 58, was convicted of drug trafficking. His \"lieutenants\" Stephen, 38, and Sean, 28, were convicted of conspiracy to supply drugs, and Robert, 36, was found guilty of possessing cash proceeds from drug trafficking. The eldest son, Ronald jnr, 39, is two years into an eight-year sentence for possessing heroin with intent to supply. \"They like to think of themselves as loveable rogues,\" said Detective Inspector Paul Grundy, who lead the inquiry. \"But they are not. They are dealers in death.\" The rise of the Compton family from the privations of Moulsecoomb to the mansions of Brighton's Tongdean neighbourhood is set against the decline of the addicts they supplied. Brighton and Hove has the highest number of heroin-related deaths of any region in the country. In 1999, the figure was over 35; by last June that record had already been beaten. \"It is easier to get a bag of heroin than a cup of tea in Brighton,\" said Neil Ansell, regional manager of the Big Issue. \"Heroin is more available than cannabis. I know of several people who have died of overdoses since the beginning of January.\" \"It is recognised that seaside resorts attract an itinerant population of people with social problems,\" said a spokeswoman for Addaction, the needle exchange and counselling service which since last May has registered an average of 55 addicts a month. To indicate the extent of Brighton's drugs trade, the number of addicts registering at the service's east London branch, is only 40-45 a month. Into this scene came the Comptons, who over two decades would make an estimated \u00a33m from the heroin trade. It is a commonplace of drug dealing that the higher up the supply chain you operate, the less likely you are to be drug-using yourself. The remarkable thing about the Comptons is that despite their seniority, as heroin wholesalers, members of the family were themselves taking drugs and to an extent that threatened to destroy them. Salutary effect In 1993, Robert Compton's wife Alison died from a heroin-related illness; Stephen Compton's partner Jacky died after an overdose of amphetamines. When Sean and Sasha Compton's baby girl was born, it was with an opiate addiction from which she is just now recovering. \"I hope that fact had a salutary effect on you,\" said Judge Scott-Gall while sentencing Sean to four and a half years' imprisonment. Sasha Compton sobbed before retreating to her six bedroom, mock-Tudor house with intercom and video entry facilities. The family business started three miles from the genteel lanes of Tongdean, in Brighton's Moulsecoomb estate, a district marked by the unhappy juxtaposition of frightened pensioners in well-kept houses with squalid dealers' homes bearing the scars of serial efforts to kick the doors in. The police have intelligence tracing the Compton family business back 15 years, to when the sons were teenagers and Ronald snr described himself as an antiques dealer. They did not operate on a grand scale. \"It made me laugh when they described Stephen as the 'banker' in the family,\" said a former neighbour, still fearful enough of recriminations to withhold his name. \"I remember seeing him dealing in broad daylight right outside the shop. But they were a great deal better than what came in after them.\" As the sons grew up, they acquired nominal trades for themselves: Robert was a \"jewellery dealer\"; Sean, despite the mansion and Mercedes he later purchased, identified himself as a \"handyman\"; Stephen followed his father into the \"antiques business\". As the dynasty grew and a steady supply of heroin was secured from London and Liverpool, the Compton parents moved to Woodingdean, a quiet hilltop area overlooking the sea, where Margaret Compton still lives. They began investing in property under the name Comptons of Brighton. Margaret Compton opened a florists in the city centre. \"I did well,\" she said last week, still maintaining the innocence if not of her husband (he pleaded guilty to charges of trafficking), then at least of her sons. \"We paid \u00a389,000 for this house and we've got a mortgage like anyone else. I had a car on hire purchase - now if I was rolling in all this drugs money, why would I do that?\" Contaminated The evidence collated by the intelligence branch of the Sussex police was incontrovertible, however. When Ronald jnr's home was raided three years ago, police found 60kg of cannabis resin with a street value of between \u00a390,000 and \u00a3144,000. They also recovered \u00a313,750 worth of heroin. A year later, under Operation Sun Spot, 50 officers raided the rest of the family's homes and recovered 1.2kg of heroin worth \u00a350,000 and a stash of \u00a3170,000, most of it stuffed into tins of instant potato mix or hidden under floorboards. Some 95% of the notes were contaminated with traces of heroin. It was the biggest seizure in Sussex for 10 years and the end of one of Brighton's most extensive organised crime families. The ripple effect this bust has had on crime figures in Brighton is difficult to quantify. \"There will be a void,\" said Det Insp Grundy, pointing to Home Office figures which indicate that 1kg of heroin generates 220 victims of burglary and \u00a3220,000 worth of stolen property, and that each addicted offender executes somewhere in the region of 100 crimes a month. Drugs charities in Brighton, while applauding police efforts, were slightly more cautious. \"We haven't seen a dip yet,\" said a spokeswoman for Addaction. \"There is no evidence that our clients are finding it more difficult to get supplies. They would be visibly suffering if that were the case. The sad fact is that it doesn't take long for someone else to come in and take over the Comptons' territory.\" \"Arresting the Comptons is a hiccup in the drugs trade,\" said Mr Ansell. \"I have never known an addict in Brighton to say, 'I've been trying all day and I can't get a bag of heroin.' The street dealers will just get their supplies from someone else.\" He added: \"I've known dealers to have been put away in the morning, and by the afternoon, for their mobile phones to have been in use by other dealers who have taken over the good will of the business.\" The demand for heroin in Brighton has pushed prices to \u00a315-\u00a320 for a fraction of a gram and crack has started making an appearance. \"The way we are tackling it is to come down extremely hard on the dealers,\" said Glynn Jones, chief executive of Brighton and Hove council and chair of the Drug and Alcohol Action Team. \"We are coordinating with the health authority, the police and drugs charities to form a consistent approach, and ensure that action taken against dealers is not in conflict with the rehabilitation of users.\" The team is also working with Brighton schools to send in ex-addicts to talk to pupils about the dangers of drug taking. Margaret Compton, meanwhile, continues to plead persecution. Charges of trafficking against her remain on police files and the authorities are seeking to recover the rest of the money made from the business. \"He did a bad thing and he paid for it,\" she said of her husband, before driving the three miles to her daughter-in-law Sasha's house, to help with the newly fatherless grandchildren.",

      "bodyText": "The RSPCA yesterday won the right to exclude pro-hunting infiltrators from joining the animal welfare charity in an attempt to change its policy on bloodsports. But pro-hunt campaigners claimed the high court judgment was at most a partial victory for the RSPCA as Mr Justice Lightman stopped the charity from arbitrarily excluding anyone it believed had suspicious motives for joining. Instead the animal welfare group will have to give all applicants a chance to explain their primary motives for becoming members. The RSPCA took the unusual step of seeking guidance from the high court to clarify its membership rules after officials suspected the charity had fallen victim to \"entryism\" by the pro-hunting Countryside Animal Welfare Group, led by the Olympic equestrian medallist Richard Meade. Last year the charity put on hold 600 applications for membership, which it believed were part of a campaign to overturn its opposition to hunting with dogs, a keystone policy of the RSPCA since 1976. Mr Meade, who denies the allegation of entryism, claims the CAWG was formed by those in rural areas who believed the RSPCA had \"lost its way\". The group was represented at the hearing, together with two applicants whose membership had not been confirmed, to oppose the RSPCA move. The society told the judge that any infiltration campaign to change the official policy and promote field sports was damaging. Mr Justice Lightman said the society did have the right to exclude or remove members under its rules but to do so meant every case would have to go before the full 25-strong council, which cannot delegate its powers. The RSPCA had asked the judge to approve a scheme to exclude anyone who fell within categories it thought indicated they were joining to promote hunting with dogs - without giving them a chance to deny this. But the judge said: \"After long and anxious consideration, I have concluded that it is not in the interests of the society or conducive to its good name to adopt such an arbitrary and unattractive method of implementing the membership policy.\" He said applicants must be given the chance to explain their motives \"to meet the real risk of injustice arising from wrong categorisation\". Malcolm Phipps, chairman of the RSPCA's ruling council, said he welcomed the ruling. \"The RSPCA is a democratic organisation, but clearly concerted efforts to join the society for any overriding reason other than animal welfare makes a mockery of this democracy.

Any Winnie the Pooh illustration by EH Shephard would now fetch anything from \u00a350,000 to \u00a3125,000 at auction, depending on condition and rarity - twice or even three times what they would have realised five years ago.

      "body": "<p>The entire genetic code for the crop that feeds half the planet - rice - has been unravelled by the European agribusiness giant Syngenta and an American firm that patented two breast cancer genes, it was announced yesterday. </p> <p>They finished the project two years ahead of a publicly-funded consortium of scientists in Japan, China, Korea, Europe and the US. </p> <p>Rice is the first crop plant, and only the second plant of any kind, to be sequenced. This means that scientists now have the grain's entire 430m-letter DNA code to an accuracy of 99.5%. In that code could be up to 50,000 genes which will almost certainly hold the secrets of higher yields, better pest-resistance and richer nourishment for the 3bn for whom rice is a staple of survival. The researchers promised seeds with new properties in about five years. </p> <p>The announcement triggered alarm from Action Aid, the hunger charity, which pointed out that there were already 229 patents on rice and that the diet of some of the world's poorest people should not become the preserve of big business. Nor should companies patent genes or DNA. Syngenta has its headquarters in Basle, Switzerland. It entered a $33m [\u00a320m] deal with Myriad Genetics of Salt Lake City, Utah, to race through the genome of rice ahead of the international rice genome sequencing project led by Japan. Myriad Genetics triggered uproar among genetic researchers and cancer charities in the 1990s when it claimed patents on two genes linked with breast cancer, and developed diagnostic tests. </p> <p>Genetic scientists have so far decoded the genomes of yeast, viruses, bacteria, a fruit fly, a nematode worm, a human being and a small weed related to the mustard family. An intimate understanding of how rice grows, flowers, sets seed and ripens will be of incalculable importance both to commercial growers and to subsistence farmers everywhere. </p> <p>But what began as international co-operation to understand more about life's machinery turned into a series of races as big corporations began to scent huge profits in the \"intellectual property\" behind biotechnology. The international researchers began co-operating seven years ago. Syngenta and Myriad joined forces and finished the job in a year and a half, relying on new techniques, state-of-the-art computer power and the spur of huge potential rewards. </p> <p>Syngenta said yesterday that it would sell data on the rice genome to seed businesses and other commercial groups, and make the information available to scientists \"through research contracts\". It also said it would provide information \"without royalties or technology fees\" to scientists helping subsistence farmers. Rice is grown in 100 countries but nine tenths of the world's crop is produced in Asia. </p> <p>The two companies said that they would not attempt to patent the rice genome but they could patent particular uses of genes as they were identified. </p> <p>\"Understanding cereal genetic structure and associated proteins will enable plant breeders to produce crops that are more nutritious, more productive and easier to process,\" said David Evans, head of research at Syngenta. \"We will also research new ways to protect crops from diseases or pests and discover new uses for crop plants...\" </p> <p>Humans have been growing rice for 5,000 years. A member of the grass family, it provides four-fifths of south-east Asia's calories, and research groups everywhere are working on ways of stepping up the crop's protein and vitamin content. One Swiss team, working with a US foundation, recently announced a genetically-modified strain enriched with vitamin A, which could reduce blindness among children in the developing world. New varieties developed in the so-called \"green revolution\" of the last 30 years have doubled world production. But demand is expected to increase by 70% over the next 30 years, as the population of the planet soars to 8bn or more.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The entire genetic code for the crop that feeds half the planet - rice - has been unravelled by the European agribusiness giant Syngenta and an American firm that patented two breast cancer genes, it was announced yesterday. They finished the project two years ahead of a publicly-funded consortium of scientists in Japan, China, Korea, Europe and the US. Rice is the first crop plant, and only the second plant of any kind, to be sequenced. This means that scientists now have the grain's entire 430m-letter DNA code to an accuracy of 99.5%. In that code could be up to 50,000 genes which will almost certainly hold the secrets of higher yields, better pest-resistance and richer nourishment for the 3bn for whom rice is a staple of survival. The researchers promised seeds with new properties in about five years. The announcement triggered alarm from Action Aid, the hunger charity, which pointed out that there were already 229 patents on rice and that the diet of some of the world's poorest people should not become the preserve of big business. Nor should companies patent genes or DNA. Syngenta has its headquarters in Basle, Switzerland. It entered a $33m [\u00a320m] deal with Myriad Genetics of Salt Lake City, Utah, to race through the genome of rice ahead of the international rice genome sequencing project led by Japan. Myriad Genetics triggered uproar among genetic researchers and cancer charities in the 1990s when it claimed patents on two genes linked with breast cancer, and developed diagnostic tests. Genetic scientists have so far decoded the genomes of yeast, viruses, bacteria, a fruit fly, a nematode worm, a human being and a small weed related to the mustard family. An intimate understanding of how rice grows, flowers, sets seed and ripens will be of incalculable importance both to commercial growers and to subsistence farmers everywhere. But what began as international co-operation to understand more about life's machinery turned into a series of races as big corporations began to scent huge profits in the \"intellectual property\" behind biotechnology. The international researchers began co-operating seven years ago. Syngenta and Myriad joined forces and finished the job in a year and a half, relying on new techniques, state-of-the-art computer power and the spur of huge potential rewards. Syngenta said yesterday that it would sell data on the rice genome to seed businesses and other commercial groups, and make the information available to scientists \"through research contracts\". It also said it would provide information \"without royalties or technology fees\" to scientists helping subsistence farmers. Rice is grown in 100 countries but nine tenths of the world's crop is produced in Asia. The two companies said that they would not attempt to patent the rice genome but they could patent particular uses of genes as they were identified. \"Understanding cereal genetic structure and associated proteins will enable plant breeders to produce crops that are more nutritious, more productive and easier to process,\" said David Evans, head of research at Syngenta. \"We will also research new ways to protect crops from diseases or pests and discover new uses for crop plants...\" Humans have been growing rice for 5,000 years. A member of the grass family, it provides four-fifths of south-east Asia's calories, and research groups everywhere are working on ways of stepping up the crop's protein and vitamin content. One Swiss team, working with a US foundation, recently announced a genetically-modified strain enriched with vitamin A, which could reduce blindness among children in the developing world. New varieties developed in the so-called \"green revolution\" of the last 30 years have doubled world production. But demand is expected to increase by 70% over the next 30 years, as the population of the planet soars to 8bn or more.",

The photograph encapsulates that vicious strand in European culture which has stigmatised, persecuted and murdered whoever could be categorised as different. This Christian European tradition found perfect expression for its unquestioning superiority in its anti-semitism and in its racism. Science was harnessed in the 19th and 20th centuries to justify and legitimise this supremacy of white Europeans - hence the pseudo-science of measuring the man's nose. The warning is clear: the Holocaust was a unique historical event in a particular country, but the racism, anti-semitism and eugenics which motivated it were common to all Europe. More importantly, fragments of them all persist; even, in places, flourish.</p> <p>It has taken many decades to achieve such clarity. For years after the second world war, the Holocaust was not discussed. That changed in the 80s, and now, the further from 1945 we get, the more the Holocaust is moving into the mainstream, with dedicated museums around the world and Hollywood box-office hits. The shift in Britain has been equally dramatic; in the immediate post-war period, the commonly held British view was that this was an event unique to German history with little relevance to the UK. Yet today, the first Holocaust Memorial Day (HMD), the event will be marked with a national ceremony, exhibitions, local talks and educational programmes promoted by the government throughout the country. This is not just about remembrance of the victims of a terrible atrocity; what lies behind today's events is a hugely ambitious attempt to mould the country's political culture.</p> <p>This was made explicit at the conference in Stockholm last year which has led to several European countries fixing January 27 - the day Auschwitz-Birkenau was liberated - as Holocaust Memorial Day. They are using history for a contemporary political purpose: the message is that the spectrum of racism starts with individual tragedies, such as the murder of Stephen Lawrence, and ends in the horror of the Holocaust. The Chief Rabbi, Dr Jonathan Sacks, made exactly this point on the BBC Today programme yesterday. The intention is to use the shock provoked by this unique historical event to inculcate the virtues of tolerance and individual responsibility into political consciousness.</p> <p>The reason why this is happening now is that globalisation has created an acute need for both. Firstly, the increasing movements of populations around the world underline the importance of tolerance: just this week it was reported that the biggest source of British population growth now is immigration, and last year the UK absorbed the highest number of asylum seekers ever - 76,000. This is a Europe-wide phenomenon, and many governments are having to consider how to assimilate these populations and promote racial harmony. HMD is one strategy, heavily weighted with emotion and idealism, to facilitate this increasingly multicultural Europe.</p> <p>Secondly, throughout the educational and promotional material the responsibility of the individual is stressed. This is an attempt to challenge the \"walk-by culture\" which Jack Straw blamed for the fate of Damilola Taylor. Globalisation by its scale reduces our sense of agency and induces apathy: \"there's nothing I can do\" is the common refrain. Combating this resignation and insisting on the individual's responsibilities has always been central to New Labour philosophy; it spans the local, in Peckham, through to the global and to Tony Blair's insistence on our international responsibilities in Kosovo or Sierra Leone.</p> <p>Any project as heavily loaded with ambition and idealism as this one is inevitably riddled with contradictions. Most noticeably, the admirable promotion of racial tolerance rings hollow given this government's asylum policy; vouchers, dispersal, putting asylum seekers in prison are all contributing to stigmatise migrants and put obstacles in the way of their absorption into Britain. There are also intractable issues. What abuse of human rights should or should not be included: Armenia? Cambodia? Rwanda? Does it belittle the unique scale of the Holocaust to put it alongside Bosnia? In the end, such questions will be subordinated to the day's political purpose; hence Bosnia is included to spell out a recent experience of ethnic persecution.</p> <p>This day will serve the purpose of public remembrance and reaffirmation of ideals, much like Remembrance Day. But will it be a remote, establishment event or have the popular resonance necessary to shift political consciousness? That depends precariously on the strength of the links between the Lawrence case and the Holocaust: on how and whether people connect everyday experiences of racist prejudice with the horror of Nazi policies to exterminate an entire race. The historian Peter Novick's shrewd assessment is this: \"If there are, in fact, lessons to be learnt from history, the Holocaust would seem an unlikely source... because of its extremity. Lessons for dealing with the sorts of issues that confront us in ordinary life, public and private, are not likely to be found in this most extraordinary of events.\" Admirable though its purpose and the intentions of its creators may be, this innovation's chance of lasting success remains uncertain.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Nelson Mandela last night dismissed allegations that he had a longstanding relationship with MI6 as slanderous and a \"disgraceful fabrication\". The allegations are contained in The Big Breach, a book by the MI6 renegade officer, Richard Tomlinson, published in Russia. There are undoubtedly \"conservative elements\" in Britain who think \"only whites, not blacks, should enjoy international recognition and respect\", he told the Guardian. Those elements, he said, were \"deeply uncomfortable with the idea of a black person being hailed as one of the outstanding figures of our time. In order to undermine or destroy that image, they are prepared to resort to slander without any facts to substantiate it.\" He said the allegation in the book that he had spent a day in Kent in 1990 having secret discussions with MI6 was a \"disgraceful fabrication\". He continued: \"If we had such relations with British or any other intelligence agencies there should somewhere be some evidence of the contract or of payments made.\" The fabrications, Mr Mandela added, \"should be dismissed with the contempt they deserve\". Mr Tomlinson claims the South African nationalist leader had a \"longstanding\" relationship with MI6 and that the agency uncovered a white supremacist plot by the AWB, or Afrikaaner Weerstandsbeweging, to assassinate him in 1993. He alleges that Mr Mandela paid a visit to Britain three years earlier for secret talks with MI6. Mr Mandela did visit England in June 1990 after a tour of European capitals which had included a grand reception by the then French president, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, in Paris. He stayed for two days in a house in Kent, arranged by the British government. His purpose was not to talk to MI6 but to see Oliver Tambo, then president of the ANC, and his wife Adelaide, and to rest before travelling to the US. Late in the evening of June 16 he wanted to talk to the then prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, and made contact with a private secretary. She had a friendly conversation with Mr Mandela for half an hour on the phone early next morning, when she warned him about his hectic timetable. \"If you keep this up, you will not come out of America alive,\" she told him. A senior official who was in Downing Street at the time says no intelligence report was received after the visit. In a separate passage of his book, Mr Tomlinson also alleges that MI6 officers orchestrated a smear campaign against the Egyptian diplomat and politician, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, in an futile effort to sink his chances of becoming the United Nations secretary-general in 1992. The MI6 campaign, which entailed planting stories in the media reflecting unfavourably on the Egyptian, was carried out at the request of the CIA - requests that Britain's Secret Intelligence Service is always eager to satisfy, the renegade spy alleges. Mr Boutros-Ghali got the top job at the UN, but US and British opposition to the UN chief helped to torpedo his at tempt to secure a second term and left him embittered at his treatment. The MI6 operation was handled by the Information Operations section, MI6's spin doctors, says Mr Tomlinson. \"The CIA is constitutionally prevented from manipulating the press, so it asked MI6 to help. Using its contacts in the British and American media, I/OPS planted a series of stories to portray Boutros-Ghali as unbalanced, claiming he was a believer in the existence of UFOs and extraterrestrial life.\" The allegations of MI6 servility to the Americans and its hostility towards and espionage against Britain's European Union partners run all through Mr Tomlinson's bitter, self-aggrandising book. Soon after joining MI6 in 1991, Mr Tomlinson says, the then chief, Sir Colin McColl, told the new recruits: \"Our relationship with the Americans will always be more important than that with the various European intelligence services.\" The MI6 chief is also quoted as saying: \"The relationship between the CIA and MI6 is central to the special relationship between our countries. \"Our greatest allies will continue to be our American cousins.\" Mr Tomlinson writes that the CIA exploited its British counterpart as its \"Euro-mole\".",

Although Brussels admits that it has so far failed to find firm evidence that Europeans are paying far too much for their CDs, it strongly believes that there is more than enough circumstantial evidence to warrant a full inquiry. The five music labels under suspicion are Britain's EMI Group, Germany's Bertelsmann, Warner Music, Sony Corp and Universal together with five online retailers and 13 traditional retailers. The commission is particularly interested to find out why there are such wide disparities in CD prices within Europe and why music costs so much more to buy in Europe than it does in the US. It also wants to know why a CD costs almost a third more than a cassette for exactly the same content. A UK Consumers' Association survey looked at the Britney Spears' best-selling album, Oops, I did it Again, which cost an average of \u00a310.77 in US music stores compared to \u00a312.08 in the EU. In Italy the same album costs and average of \u00a314.16 while in London it costs \u00a312.26. The commission has sent out letters of inquiry to all of the firms under suspicion. but it will be months before it reaches a conclusion at which point it will either decide to drop the case or issue a formal warning to the big five and step up its inquiries. Any investigation could last up to two years. \"If we find evidence to support these claims we could fine the companies concerned a maximum of 10% of their annual turnover and force them to change their ways,\" said a commission official, who stressed that the investigation was still at a very early stage. The issue caught Brussels' eye last year when it vetted a massive merger between EMI and Warner Music which it subsequently rejected on the grounds that it would harm competition. It was also encouraged by a similar investigation in the US which concluded that American consumers had paid \u00a3320m over the odds for their CDs since 1997. The US authorities discovered that the big five music firms had been setting minimum retail prices for CDs for at least five years and encouraging retailers to fall into line by funding chunks of their advertising budgets. The big five agreed to stop fixing minimum prices in May of last year and the US authorities told Brussels that there might be a problem in Europe too. The commission has not received any formal complaints about CD prices but argues that it has the power to initiate its own investigation since consumer groups in Europe, have voiced serious concerns. The music industry is already fighting a rearguard action from internet sites offering free music downloads. If Brussels did find evidence that the big five are colluding on prices it would be far less likely to authorise big industry mergers in the future.",

      "body": "<p>Due to deregulation and globalisation the UK's fastest job creating industries - banking, insurance, fund management, stockbroking, accountancy, law and software services - have experienced more change in the last 10 years than in the previous 40. Customers now have almost limitless choice, as do shareholders, and both want more for less.</p> <p>As a result, individual service institutions are seeking to gain an edge by revamping their business models. This has had a notable knock-on effect on the way they deal with their staff, according to a new study commissioned jointly by K Learning, KPMG's financial services learning practice, and the London Human Resource Group, a network of 17 leading financial institutions in the City of London.</p> <p>\"The internet has given customers an instant access to the total marketplace,\" says Chris Evans, human resources director of insurer Royal &amp; Sun Alliance. \"This has far-reaching implications for the way we manage, develop and deploy our people. Manpower planning is at the top of the agenda.\"</p> <p>As an integral part of that process, the human resources organisation is being changed in two respects. Job demarcations are being redefined and HR professionals are increasingly getting involved in areas that impact on business results. These include performance management, quality orientation and executive coaching. And line managers are increasingly getting involved in activities like recruitment, training, and succession planning. A new, overarching role of HR-business partner is created to provide boardroom level business solutions.</p> <p>On the coalface the range of channels used to provide services to employees is extended to include self-service tools based on corporate intranets and specialist centres providing solutions in areas such as employment law and culture change. One in five institutions has already altered demarcations and roles with many more expecting to do so over the next three years. John Matheson, head of personnel at the Bank of England, says: \"We need to have an effective HR function which provides numerous self-service tools to line managers and staff alike. We are starting this mechanism by building a corporate intranet.\"</p> <p>First and foremost, these and other changes underline the point that strategic HR is now about building the capability to cope with changing goalposts in the market place. \"Our explosive growth has hugely increased the diversity of our businesses,\" says Mike Williams, director of HR at Cisco Sys tems. \"To cater for it we're putting together the best expertise and delivery channels that help us stay ahead of the curve.\"</p> <p>\"The biggest challenge is how its HR managers become effective change agents in their new partnership role,\" says Geoff Morgan, HR director at insurance market Lloyd's of London.</p> <p>\"The question is all the more pertinent because we are seeing a growing convergence between two distinct disciplines: human resource management and organisation development,\" adds Norman Mitchinson, group HR director at Lloyds TSB. This convergence requires HR professionals and their line counterparts to widen and deepen their existing skills base. No longer is it sufficient to have on-the-job training backed by classroom learning. \"For both groups, their understanding of the 'big picture' has so far been fairly limited, as is their ability to inspire trust and motivation for the essential change,\" says Michael Robinson, head of HR at fund management firm Invesco.</p> <p>What is needed now are new avenues of learning like coaching, mentoring, and e-learning. To meet this need, institutions are increasingly outsourcing their training provision to providers experienced in managing projects on business transformation. This is used to raise the ability of HR professionals and line managers in managing culture change.</p> <p>Financial services institutions are bringing in external experts to trigger internal learning. Their training budgets increased by nearly a quarter between 1995 and 2000, with the biggest increase occurring in banking, insurance, fund management and software services.</p> <p>So overwhelming is the need to jettison the old culture that in many companies the new roles have been implemented despite long pay-back periods.This has not been easy. In many companies, HR professionals have viewed the changes as devaluing their craft and line managers see them as overloading their jobs. However, the study concludes that the opposition is the birth-pangs of a new model at the workplace which rules out a return to old ways.</p> <p>\u0095 Professor Amin Rajan is chief executive of the Centre for Reserach in Employment and Technology in Europe (Create) and Gary Storer is lead consultant with K Learning (KPMG).

This has had a notable knock-on effect on the way they deal with their staff, according to a new study commissioned jointly by K Learning, KPMG's financial services learning practice, and the London Human Resource Group, a network of 17 leading financial institutions in the City of London. \"The internet has given customers an instant access to the total marketplace,\" says Chris Evans, human resources director of insurer Royal &amp; Sun Alliance. \"This has far-reaching implications for the way we manage, develop and deploy our people. Manpower planning is at the top of the agenda.\" As an integral part of that process, the human resources organisation is being changed in two respects. Job demarcations are being redefined and HR professionals are increasingly getting involved in areas that impact on business results. These include performance management, quality orientation and executive coaching. And line managers are increasingly getting involved in activities like recruitment, training, and succession planning. A new, overarching role of HR-business partner is created to provide boardroom level business solutions. On the coalface the range of channels used to provide services to employees is extended to include self-service tools based on corporate intranets and specialist centres providing solutions in areas such as employment law and culture change. One in five institutions has already altered demarcations and roles with many more expecting to do so over the next three years. John Matheson, head of personnel at the Bank of England, says: \"We need to have an effective HR function which provides numerous self-service tools to line managers and staff alike. We are starting this mechanism by building a corporate intranet.\" First and foremost, these and other changes underline the point that strategic HR is now about building the capability to cope with changing goalposts in the market place. \"Our explosive growth has hugely increased the diversity of our businesses,\" says Mike Williams, director of HR at Cisco Sys tems. \"To cater for it we're putting together the best expertise and delivery channels that help us stay ahead of the curve.\" \"The biggest challenge is how its HR managers become effective change agents in their new partnership role,\" says Geoff Morgan, HR director at insurance market Lloyd's of London. \"The question is all the more pertinent because we are seeing a growing convergence between two distinct disciplines: human resource management and organisation development,\" adds Norman Mitchinson, group HR director at Lloyds TSB. This convergence requires HR professionals and their line counterparts to widen and deepen their existing skills base. No longer is it sufficient to have on-the-job training backed by classroom learning. \"For both groups, their understanding of the 'big picture' has so far been fairly limited, as is their ability to inspire trust and motivation for the essential change,\" says Michael Robinson, head of HR at fund management firm Invesco. What is needed now are new avenues of learning like coaching, mentoring, and e-learning. To meet this need, institutions are increasingly outsourcing their training provision to providers experienced in managing projects on business transformation. This is used to raise the ability of HR professionals and line managers in managing culture change. Financial services institutions are bringing in external experts to trigger internal learning. Their training budgets increased by nearly a quarter between 1995 and 2000, with the biggest increase occurring in banking, insurance, fund management and software services. So overwhelming is the need to jettison the old culture that in many companies the new roles have been implemented despite long pay-back periods.This has not been easy. In many companies, HR professionals have viewed the changes as devaluing their craft and line managers see them as overloading their jobs. However, the study concludes that the opposition is the birth-pangs of a new model at the workplace which rules out a return to old ways. \u0095 Professor Amin Rajan is chief executive of the Centre for Reserach in Employment and Technology in Europe (Create) and Gary Storer is lead consultant with K Learning (KPMG).

How did NTL get its cost projections so wrong? \"We underestimated the amount of internet usage by customers. There was no model of free, unlimited access in the UK. People used it far more than we expected, which is why we had to ration the discs,\" says Ms Aldridge. Many other 'free' internet service providers have since quit the market or started charging.</p> <p>Last August Alta Vista, which had signed up 274,000 customers for its unmetered service, abandoned its deal, and in the same month LineOne axed its free service. Does NTL's price hike indicate that it too is about to abandon free and unmetered internet access? \"We are the only provider who launched in the early part of last year which has sustained its free service... but the fact is that there are commercial pressures,\" says Ms Aldridge. However she adds that, for the time being at least, NTL remains committed to providing unmetered access.</p> <p>NTL says the alternatives for its customers are less attractive. It points to AOL's flat-fee service, which costs \u00a314.99 per month but does not include any non-internet calls in the price, while BT's Surf Together package at \u00a314.99 gives free internet access at weekends and evenings only and, again, does not include non-internet calls.</p> <p>But this week Freeserve launched a \u00a312.99 a month flat rate package, \u00a32 a month cheaper than AOL and BT, although potentially more expensive than NTL. Freeserve says that its package will suit users who are on-line at home for more than eight hours during peak time.</p> <p>Hopes for cheaper net access are likely to rise next week, when communications watchdog Oftel is planning to publish the results of a consultation process on future unlimited access to the internet. It is expected that it will recommend a break-up of BT's stranglehold on internet charges. But a drawback for BT phone users considering switching to another provider is that BT recently upped the cost of its line rentals. The quarterly charge rose from \u00a327.77 to \u00a329.97.</p> <p>So for an NTL user connected via BT, the minimum quarterly charge rises from \u00a330 to NTL and \u00a327.77 to BT, a total of \u00a357.77, to \u00a345 to NTL plus \u00a329.97 to BT, a total of \u00a374.97.</p>",

Last August Alta Vista, which had signed up 274,000 customers for its unmetered service, abandoned its deal, and in the same month LineOne axed its free service. Does NTL's price hike indicate that it too is about to abandon free and unmetered internet access? \"We are the only provider who launched in the early part of last year which has sustained its free service... but the fact is that there are commercial pressures,\" says Ms Aldridge. However she adds that, for the time being at least, NTL remains committed to providing unmetered access. NTL says the alternatives for its customers are less attractive. It points to AOL's flat-fee service, which costs \u00a314.99 per month but does not include any non-internet calls in the price, while BT's Surf Together package at \u00a314.99 gives free internet access at weekends and evenings only and, again, does not include non-internet calls. But this week Freeserve launched a \u00a312.99 a month flat rate package, \u00a32 a month cheaper than AOL and BT, although potentially more expensive than NTL. Freeserve says that its package will suit users who are on-line at home for more than eight hours during peak time. Hopes for cheaper net access are likely to rise next week, when communications watchdog Oftel is planning to publish the results of a consultation process on future unlimited access to the internet. It is expected that it will recommend a break-up of BT's stranglehold on internet charges. But a drawback for BT phone users considering switching to another provider is that BT recently upped the cost of its line rentals. The quarterly charge rose from \u00a327.77 to \u00a329.97. So for an NTL user connected via BT, the minimum quarterly charge rises from \u00a330 to NTL and \u00a327.77 to BT, a total of \u00a357.77, to \u00a345 to NTL plus \u00a329.97 to BT, a total of \u00a374.97.",

      "body": "<p>Keith Vaz recently declared: \"I am a leading member, if not the leading member, of the Asian community in this country. All kinds of people ask me for support.\"</p> <p>In Leicester, where he has been MP since 1987, questions around how his support is obtained have been looked at by Elizabeth Filkin, the parliamentary commissioner for standards.</p> <p>Ms Filkin was assisted in her inquiry by Mahebub Ladha, Leicester city council's principal race relations officer, who focussed on allegations that Vaz had requested what were described as \"campaign contributions\" from local businessmen in return for exerting influence on planning applications.</p> <p>A key allegation revolves around a controversial plan for Europe's biggest multi-faith centre, combining places of worship for three religions, on seven and a half acres of council-owned land at Manor Farm in Hamilton, within Mr Vaz's Leicester East constituency.</p> <p>Three groups jointly applied to develop the land for a two-storey Hindu temple, a Sikh community centre and temple to accommodate 700 worshippers, and a marble mosque with a 17-metre high minaret.</p> <p>In 1998, the land was sold to the three applicants for half of its market value of \u00a31.5m.</p> <p>A proviso was made that the developers would have to pay the cost of installing new roads and sewers, but could have the land in exchange for this if it cost more than the agreed sale price.</p> <p>Prominent businessman Jaffer Kapasi, who was promoting the scheme on behalf of the Muslim group Dawoodi Bohra Jammat, was alleged to have been asked to make payments to Vaz - a claim the MP vigorously denies.</p> <p>The other two groups involved were the the Swaminarayan Hindu Mission, who established the famous Neasden temple, and Sikh organisation the Ramgarhia Board.</p> <p>The Sikh group has since withdrawn. Both groups say that they were not asked to make any payments. The council has not finalised the deal, or decided what to do with the site originally set aside for the Sikhs.</p> <p>The city council received more than 1,000 letters of support for the scheme, but there were also nearly 700 letters of objection expressing fears that the complex could become a tourist attraction.</p> <p>A spokesman confirmed that the council was approached last Spring for information by the parliamentary commissioner and \"cooperated fully\" with her inquiries.</p> <p>Long-serving former city council leader Peter Soulsby, now Sir Peter, has given evidence directly to Ms Filkin in relation to this episode. Mr Kapasi has also given evidence.</p> <p>The inquiry has been completed but its findings have not been made public. Mr Vaz denies all the charges and recent reports suggest that he is expected to be cleared of the substantial charges. Mr Vaz has also been investigated by Labour's National Executive over a complaint from senior members of the Leicester party that he masterminded a plot to remove the leaders of the city council - including Soulsby. Mr Soulsby was ousted from the council leadership in October 1993 after a row with Mr Vaz, after the MP's mother Merlyn, a city councillor, was removed from the chairmanship of a committee. Mr Soulsby was defeated in the leadership election by a compromise candidate backed by councillors regarded as close to Mr Vaz and a group of leftwingers who had a longstanding rift with Mr Soulsby after a row over the poll tax. Mr Soulsby alleged that Mr Vaz plotted against him, but the allegations were thrown out.</p> <p>Stephen Leach, professor of local government at Leicester De Montfort University, catalogued Vaz's involvement in the leadership struggle in a book published last year.</p> <p>There is no evidence of misconduct, but Prof Leach said yesterday he was astonished by the degree to which the MP interested himself in the council's affairs.</p> <p>\"It is incredibly unusual to find an MP with this level of links to his local council.

      "bodyText": "Keith Vaz recently declared: \"I am a leading member, if not the leading member, of the Asian community in this country. All kinds of people ask me for support.\" In Leicester, where he has been MP since 1987, questions around how his support is obtained have been looked at by Elizabeth Filkin, the parliamentary commissioner for standards. Ms Filkin was assisted in her inquiry by Mahebub Ladha, Leicester city council's principal race relations officer, who focussed on allegations that Vaz had requested what were described as \"campaign contributions\" from local businessmen in return for exerting influence on planning applications. A key allegation revolves around a controversial plan for Europe's biggest multi-faith centre, combining places of worship for three religions, on seven and a half acres of council-owned land at Manor Farm in Hamilton, within Mr Vaz's Leicester East constituency. Three groups jointly applied to develop the land for a two-storey Hindu temple, a Sikh community centre and temple to accommodate 700 worshippers, and a marble mosque with a 17-metre high minaret. In 1998, the land was sold to the three applicants for half of its market value of \u00a31.5m. A proviso was made that the developers would have to pay the cost of installing new roads and sewers, but could have the land in exchange for this if it cost more than the agreed sale price. Prominent businessman Jaffer Kapasi, who was promoting the scheme on behalf of the Muslim group Dawoodi Bohra Jammat, was alleged to have been asked to make payments to Vaz - a claim the MP vigorously denies. The other two groups involved were the the Swaminarayan Hindu Mission, who established the famous Neasden temple, and Sikh organisation the Ramgarhia Board. The Sikh group has since withdrawn. Both groups say that they were not asked to make any payments. The council has not finalised the deal, or decided what to do with the site originally set aside for the Sikhs. The city council received more than 1,000 letters of support for the scheme, but there were also nearly 700 letters of objection expressing fears that the complex could become a tourist attraction. A spokesman confirmed that the council was approached last Spring for information by the parliamentary commissioner and \"cooperated fully\" with her inquiries. Long-serving former city council leader Peter Soulsby, now Sir Peter, has given evidence directly to Ms Filkin in relation to this episode. Mr Kapasi has also given evidence. The inquiry has been completed but its findings have not been made public. Mr Vaz denies all the charges and recent reports suggest that he is expected to be cleared of the substantial charges. Mr Vaz has also been investigated by Labour's National Executive over a complaint from senior members of the Leicester party that he masterminded a plot to remove the leaders of the city council - including Soulsby. Mr Soulsby was ousted from the council leadership in October 1993 after a row with Mr Vaz, after the MP's mother Merlyn, a city councillor, was removed from the chairmanship of a committee. Mr Soulsby was defeated in the leadership election by a compromise candidate backed by councillors regarded as close to Mr Vaz and a group of leftwingers who had a longstanding rift with Mr Soulsby after a row over the poll tax. Mr Soulsby alleged that Mr Vaz plotted against him, but the allegations were thrown out. Stephen Leach, professor of local government at Leicester De Montfort University, catalogued Vaz's involvement in the leadership struggle in a book published last year. There is no evidence of misconduct, but Prof Leach said yesterday he was astonished by the degree to which the MP interested himself in the council's affairs. \"It is incredibly unusual to find an MP with this level of links to his local council. I have never come across an MP who has got so involved with the details of council work.\" Keith Vaz was also involved in a Hindujas-backed scheme for a \"multi-cultural theme park\" in the Midlands before the last general election. He is understood to have advised the businessmen on how to promote a proposed centre in Peterborough, titled Concordia, which would be inspired by values derived from ancient Hindu scriptures and would include food from around the world, educational facilities and rides. It would not be surprising for a prominent Asian MP to be approached for such advice. Peter Mandelson met Srichand Hinduja at the brothers' headquarters in central London, in November 1996, when the businessman tried to enlist his support in the \u00a3101m Concordia plan, a former adviser to the Hindujas claimed. The former adviser said yesterday: \"Peter Mandelson thought it was wonderful. He was ready to support it.\" The ex-aide said the Hindujas were pushing for Concordia to be a landmark project to celebrate the Millennium, and applied for a grant from the Millennium Commission of \u00a350m. The proposal was turned down, as was a revised and more modest bid, because the commission did not feel the plans were sufficiently developed. The Hindujas remained anxious to fund a multi-cultural project and later approached NMEC chief executive Jennie Page to discuss how their ideas for Concordia could be incorporated into the Dome. Geoffrey Bindman, Mr Vaz's lawyer, said yesterday: \"He certainly expects to be cleared of all substantial allegations [by the Filkin inquiry].\" Asked about the Manor Farm allegation, he said: \"Obviously there's absolutely no truth in that whatsoever. I'm sure the inquiry will not take any different view.\"",

      "bodyText": "The lawyer leading the inquiry into the Hinduja passport crisis engulfing the government advised ministers to sign \"gagging orders\" to keep secret crucial information in the arms-to-Iraq scandal. Sir Anthony Hammond QC drew up public interest immunity certificates to suppress evidence of government collusion in the sale of weapons-making machinery to Baghdad in breach of a UN embargo. Unveiled by Downing Street as the man to get to the bottom of an affair that has cost Tony Blair one of his closest colleagues and threatens a second minister, Sir Anthony is a great defender of official secrecy. Tory home secretaries Ken Baker (now Lord Baker of Dorking) and Ken Clarke signed documents prepared by Sir Anthony to withhold information that was to prove crucial to the defence of three executives in the Matrix Churchill case. The Scott report into the arms-to-Iraq scandal recorded Sir Anthony's involvement and Lord Baker's admission that he was not told one of three executives, Paul Henderson, was an MI6 informer when he approved a ban on suppressing the involvement of the secrurity services. A certificate prepared by Sir Anthony said: \"The very nature of the work of the security and intelligence services of the crown requires secrecy if it is to be effective.\" No 10 presented Sir Anthony to the public as the former treasury solicitor but he spent only three years in that post, retiring last year after an appointment in 1997. The government has effectively picked an old Home Office hand to investigate the Home Office: Sir Anthony spent 24 years in the department up to 1992. Five years at trade and industry before becoming treasury solicitor completes his cv. He was also involved in the earlier legal battle to shut up former MI6 officer Richard Tomlinson, seeking court orders to gag the rogue spy. Nicknamed \"Wally\" after the great cricketer Wally Hammond, Sir Anthony, 60, was knighted by the Queen in May 2000. Downing Street and the home office have said Sir Anthony will be able to call all official papers and speak to officials and ministers, though no commitment has been give that the report will be published before the election. Now investigating the granting of a British passport to GP Hinduja as well as SP Hinduja, Sir Anthony was appointed to review whether the applications were \"properly dealt with in all respects\". Norman Baker, the Liberal Democrat MP who exposed the involvement of Peter Mandelson and Keith Vaz in affair, said: \"It's disappointing that the prime minister has chosen someone whose record does not appear to be a full commitment to freedom of information.

It also points out that luggage lost or stolen due to negligence is not covered by travel insurance. \u0095 Execution only stockbroker TD Waterhouse said this week that customers can view share prices in real-time on the web, or their WAP phones or through interactive digital television for the first time rather than face a 20 minute delay. Previously real-time share prices could only be viewed when executing trades. \u0095 Rival execution only stockbroker The Share Centre has opened its Share Account and Self Select Isas for real-time internet dealing. Until now customers dealt at 9.00am, 1pm or 4pm. Share Centre boasts it offers the cheapest minimum dealing commission of its main rivals. The minimum at Charles Schwab is \u00a312 and \u00a39.75 at TD Waterhouse. \u0095 Independent mortgage broker Savills Private Finance is offering a capped rate mortgage with a rate that it claims hasn't been seen since the 1950s. Homebuyers and remortgagers can apply for the 4.75% capped rate, which runs until January 2003. Then a standard variable rate of 7.74% kicks in and applies for the rest of the mortgage period. An arrangement fee of \u00a3350 applies to the loan along with a 5% redemption fee within the offer period and a maximum loan to value of 95%. Savills reckons the loan could cut the cost of a typical mortgage by almost \u00a3250 per month.",

The system was developed by a Ministry of Defence agency and the low-flying expertise of Sir Richard's Virgin group's airship division. He has enlisted Nelson Mandela, the former South African president, as a patron of the Mineseeker Foundation. It is being launched today in an attempt to map the minefields which kill or maim 25,000 civilians every year. The low-flying airships, usually used to provide aerial camera platforms above sports stadiums, will sweep former war zones to precisely locate unexploded mines. Five airships will be fitted with the systems developed by the defence evaluation and research agency in Farnborough, Hampshire. Preliminary results from a trial in Kosovo showed that an airship could identify mines at a depth of up to 4 metres while sweeping terrain at a rate of 100 square metres a second. This compares with 40 square metres a day, using conventional probes by explosives experts crawling through minefields on their stomachs. Anti-personnel mines are spread over 800,000 sq km of former war zones in four continents - an area the size of France and Germany. The issue was taken up by the late Princess of Wales but its international profile has declined since her death. Under the scheme, airships would be provided on a not-for-profit basis by the Lightship Group, part of Sir Richard's Virgin Airship and Balloon Company. Mike Kendrick, its chief executive, said 80% of land currently designated as mined was safe. By pinpointing minefields accurately, this land could be returned to productive use and civilian casualties reduced in countries such as Afghanistan, Bosnia Herzegovina, Cambodia, Chechnya, Iraq, Mozambique, Nicaragua and Kosovo. Airships were more suitable for the work than aircraft that travel too fast for accurate mapping, or helicopters that can detonate mines accidentally with their propellers. The Mineseeker Foundation will try to raise \u00a310m from commercial sponsors to develop the system and equip five airships over the next two years. Patrons include Mr Mandela and Queen Noor of Jordan. Mr Mandela said: \"I wholeheartedly support the Mineseeker Foundation, which... will make a substantial impact in de-mining efforts in communities that have been deprived of economic stability and experience terrible human suffering.\" John Flanagan, programme manager for the Mine Action Coordination Centre in Pristina, Kosovo, said: \"If there was an end to laying mines today, it would still take 1,000 years to get rid of them using conventional methods of detection.

Smith's early organ-trio records in the mid-50s were big hits from the start, and not only made him a jazz star, but created a hard-driving, bluesy sound using Hammond, drums and guitar that virtually wrote the book for half-a-century of organ jazz to come.</p> <p>McDuff was initially devoted to Smith's methods as were all his Hammond-playing contemporaries. Born in Champaign, Illinois, he taught himself piano (like Smith, he was also a bassist), shifted to the Hammond, and from the mid-50s began playing regularly around Chicago in groups that sometimes included the saxophonist Johnny Griffin.</p> <p>McDuff worked with tenor saxophonist Willis \"Gator\" Jackson until 1959, and then formed a trio on the classic Smith model.

Benson complained he was too inexperienced to take solos when he first went on the road with McDuff, but the experience eventually turned him into a jazz legend.</p> <p>Early McDuff recordings like Brother Jack (for Prestige) were to have a second coming in the 80s as anthems of the club-world of acid jazz, and their powerful swing and bluesiness, allied to an unusual delicacy and pianistic intricacy of line, quickly built McDuff's reputation as something different in a crowded field. Less abrasive and raunchy than Jimmy Smith, his take on the familiar phraseology of the blues suggested an inventive and independent musical mind.</p> <p>McDuff's career was subdued in the 70s, but revived in the latter part of the following decade.

But writing in Contrast, the austere British Film Institute quarterly, in 1962, the film critic Boleslaw Sulik condemned it as dull, depressing and predictable. Robert Robinson took over the programme, and Haigh's career declined. He went to live in Portugal, where he opened a waterside restaurant. In 1957, he had married the Rank starlet Jill Adams. They had a daughter before they separated. In Portugal, he met his second wife, the German-born Inge, who survives him.",

Many of these scents can be transferred to the house and enjoyed there in comfort but, in a warm room, they may not last that long. There are others that must be savoured in the garden or not at all.</p> <p>The most compelling of these in my own garden is Olearia solandri . The whole bush gives off the fragrance of heliotrope. But, it is not a scent that can be captured and pinned down. It has to reach you as you pass nearby and will then suddenly detain you when your thoughts were miles away. That can happen at any time of the year. This is a big shrub with tiny leaves and ochre-coloured stems. It has little white flowers for a week or so in August and they double up on the scent. It is not entirely hardy, so give it shelter from cold winds. Strong off-shore winds will not deter it in the least.</p> <p>Many cistuses have a gummy, airborne fragrance. You associate it with hot summer conditions, but it is not infrequently to be caught in winter. Cistus * cyprius is the natural hybrid that gives me greatest pleasure in this respect. In cold weather, its foliage changes to the colour of oxidised lead. In June, for rather longer than a month, it is covered every morning with a new crop of large white saucer-blooms, each petal having a maroon blotch at its base.</p> <p>Strongest flower scent on the air in January-February is the lily-of-the-valley fragrance of Mahonia japonica . This has clustered strands of pale yellow flowers surrounded by a ruff of prickle-edged, pinnate leaves. None of the hybrids derived from it share its wonderful scent to any degree. The size of the shrub is easily controlled by a heavy pruning in early spring. This will not in any way prejudice its flowering potential in the following winter, even if the cutting-back operation removes practically every leaf on the shrub.</p> <p>The spicy scent of winter sweet, Chimonanthus praecox , can also be strong on the air if the weather is mild. This is another large shrub and its foliage is spitefully uncooperative all summer, so that its being deciduous comes as a release. It is commonly raised from seed and a seedling may take six or seven years of growing and cogitating before flowering starts. Also, the quality of the flowers is variable and may be disappointing. But you have to start somewhere. Tuck the shrub away in a warm corner. I should add that it is unlikely to ripen sufficiently to flower at all, ever, in the north of Britain. There are named clones and if these are vegetatively propagated, as they should be, onset of flowering will be much earlier. Some flower earlier than others, and if a range of cultivars is grown this can spread their season from late November to February. I don't want to sound discouraging, but winter sweet is a shrub for the dedicated and sedentary gardener.</p> <p>Not so the shrub honeysuckle, Lonicera * purpusii , which will flower from early youth, but is no more comely a feature in the summer than winter sweet. Winter- flowering shrubs should be scattered discreetly through the garden so as to cause minimum distress in their off-season, which is at a time of year when we most want to enjoy our gardens by actually being in them. This honeysuckle has a long flowering season, which reaches its peak in late winter. It wafts generously. The flowers themselves are borne in pairs and are off-white in colour. Pruning consists of removing whole branches of old, twiggy growth, so as to encourage the shrub to renew itself. Do this in March, immediately flowering has more or less petered out. Young foliage unfolds early so some of this may have to be sacrificed.</p> <p>The Chinese witch hazel, Hamamelis mollis (as dull a shrub in summer as any) has a wonderfully individual fragrance. It needs no pruning, but you will want to cut it for the house as soon as it is large enough to be plundered. The light yellow H. * intermedia 'Pallida' is the showiest in a garden setting, with longer petals than most. Brown-flowered kinds are beautiful in the hand, but do not show up well outside. Viburnum farreri and the stiff V. * bodnantense are heavily almond-scented and flower any time from autumn to early spring, though sometimes annoyingly before they have shed their leaves in autumn. The flowers are frost-tender. Pale, slightly grubby pink is the normal colouring (a stronger pink in spring), but I prefer the pure white V. farreri 'Candidissimum', whose young foliage has the additional merit of being a very fresh light green.</p> <p>The common snowdrop smells of honey and it is a treat to have a big bunch of it by your side in the house. Some crocuses are honey-scented, notably Crocus chrysanthus 'Snow Bunting', which is also one of the earliest of the winter-flowering kinds. My first, this year, opened wide to the sun on January 6 and that is not unusual. But it is often sold untrue to name, whiter but later-flowering and unscented. Very heavily fragrant among the earliest-flowering narcissi is Narcissus tazetta , which gives its name to a whole range of cluster-headed cultivars. My stock came to me from Kew (Wakehurst Place), but it is a variable species, having a wide geographical range. First blooms may open in January but a succession continues into April. The flowers are white (with a cream cup) and the leaves dark green. It is liable to frost damage, so a position against a warm wall is worth sparing.</p>",

A magnum is a splendid shape to find wine in and, at that price, you can afford to be generous with it. It is a superbly adult brew of warmth and wit, offering plummy fruit allied to great tannins. It is fresh-edged and full of fun, and you can pick it up at \u00a34.99 only until February 4, when it reverts to its usual price of \u00a35.99. It rates 15.5 points out of 20.</p> <p>Waitrose has several interesting wines also on offer until February 4. Abbotts Ammonite Cte du Roussillon 1999 (15.5 points, \u00a33.99) has superb tannins and texture for the money. There is great elegance and class here, as the wine has something to say for itself. James Herrick Chardonnay Vin de Pays d'Oc 1999 (16 points, \u00a33.99) is subtle, gently fruity, stylish and well- tailored. It shows a lovely lemon edge as it finishes. Zagara Catarratto Chardonnay 1999 (16 points, \u00a33.49), from Sicily, is absurdly underpriced. It is a gooseberry, lemon and melon-fruited wine, classily assembled and so stylish for the money it almost defies belief. It goes well with spicy fish, or, indeed, with the spicy mishmash that characterises ribald conversation at dinner parties these days.</p> <p>At Tesco, Somerfield and Kwik Save there is Banrock Station Chardonnay 1999. The previous vintage of this wine, indeed the whole Banrock range, seemed to be imitating sticky-toffee pudding, so chewy and blatant was it, but the 1999s redeem themselves somewhat. This chardonnay offers firm, melon fruit with crisp, citric acids, and at \u00a33.99 represents great value for such engaging Aussie style. It rates 15.5 points.</p> <p>At Tesco, Unwins, Oddbins and Safeway there is Cono Sur Pinot Noir Reserve 1999 (16 points, \u00a36.99). This is chewy, ripe, thick, aromatic, tannic and charmingly lingering. It has a certain richness that recalls Volnay, though this once-wonderful burgundy has no examples nowadays that parade Cono Sur's singular charms for the same money.</p> <p>The rest of what follows is all to be found at Tesco. Santorini Chardonnay 1999 (16 points, \u00a34.99), from the Greek island that some believe was once Atlantis, exhibits delightful richness and acidic freshness combined in a very striking way, accomplishing subtlety with weight. Tre Uve Ultima 1998 (16 points, \u00a35.99) is an Italian red offering a superbly rolling tannic richness geared to run smoothly alongside plum/blackberry fruit. Splendid glugging here. Thandi Elgin Chardonnay 1999 (16 points, \u00a36.99), from South Africa, has marvellous dash and richness: creamy, gently spicy, textured, very deep. A food wine, a conversation wine, a bottle to acquire when you wish to demonstrate your versatility and acumen. Camelot 1999 (16 points, \u00a39.99) is a red wine from Sicily, no proceeds from which, as far as I know, go to the lottery operators of this name. You may well expostulate at a tenner for a Sicilian red (I did), but this is a wine of compelling character, made in limited quantities and thus available only at selected branches where the car parks show a preponderance of Volvo estates and the like (call 0800 505555 for details). It shows stunning, earthy fruit of hedgerow complexity and great concentration. The fruit is beautifully orchestrated with the tannins. Kumala Semillon Chardonnay 2000 (15.5 points, \u00a33.99) has deliciously rich, gooseberry fruit, ripe yet balanced. This wine can also be found at Thresher.</p> <p>And last at Tesco, a syrah from Chile. Caliterra Syrah 1999 (16 points, \u00a35.49) is a very leathery, savoury, pliant wine that oozes charm without being OTT. It is unashamedly modern, yet not brash or too full of itself. It is one of those wines I wish I encountered more when I went out to eat, at restaurants or friends' homes, for it is deliciously inexpensive when compared with many a shiraz, and it is a wine you can toy with as you talk between mouthfuls.</p> <p>For the latest wine news, or to email Malcolm Gluck, visit www.superplonk.com.</p>",

      "body": "<p>There was a spell, in the early 90s, when Naomi Tate's apartment, a faux Villa Medici in mid-Kensington, was the in place with fashion photographers. \"Everyone, but everyone, wanted it, darling,\" says her agent, Anna Darby, of Lavish Locations. But a flurry of high-profile shoots was followed by a long, long silence. When everyone, but everyone, wanted pristine minimalism, Tate's \"faded palazzo\", with its raw, variegated plaster walls and rich m\u00e9lange of antique textiles, dropped off the hot list like a stone. </p> <p>\"There were clients who still wanted to use it, but only if Tate could be persuaded to paint her walls white,\" says Darby. \"Of course, she told me to go forth and multiply. So, as a fashion-location, the place died a death.\" Poor Naomi. Well, yes. And no. The fashion location market, like fashion itself, is a whimsical trade, subject to a constant, shifting cycle of prevailing trends. A few seasons later, and not only has minimalism been \"shagged to death, darling\", but Tate's flat is back in vogue (indeed, in Vogue). \"Suddenly, it took off again,\" squeals Darby. \"Now it's gone completely mad.\" </p> <p>Tate's recent clients include Tatler, Harpers &amp; Queen, German Elle, various fashion advertising agencies (\"I don't always pay much attention to who they are,\" she admits) and the photographer Corinne Day, who spent a day in her living room with Kate Moss shooting fashion stills for Vogue's Gold issue, published last December. </p> <p>For this, Day shot Moss lying on a bed of old gold brocade in a Sportmax tinsel mini; and, in another photograph, her legs, clad in Paco Rabanne's slashed chain-mail hipsters, sprawled across frayed damask upholstery. Moss also squatted on the original parquet flooring in \u00a32,000-worth of sequinned \"heirloom material\"; perched on the edge of a stool, eating what looks like an M&amp;S sandwich, in nothing but Roberto Cavalli lingerie, an \"amazing\" diamant\u00e9 suspender belt and vintage Vivienne Westwood boots. Behind her, a pair of disintegrating red silk curtains (circa 1800) fall into crumpled folds on to an antique Persian rug; there's a glimpse of genuine Victorian plaster; a hint of radiator piping - all lit by a pale wash of what looks like natural sunlight (though photographic lighting can fake it where necessary). </p> <p>Tate, a ballet dancer, did not set out to turn her apartment into a photography location. The Villa Medici number in her house was, after all, her own personal expression of home. But later, when a magazine article inspired her to try letting it out to photographers and film production companies, the place turned out to have everything they needed: big open spaces, lots of light, atmosphere and interesting photogenic features (period fireplaces, garden statuary, and pale but interesting walls are popular with fashion clients). </p> <p>Film companies tend to pay more, but, says Tate, they are \"extremely demanding - they just take over\". Fashion stills and other product photography is far less obtrusive(shorter hours, fewer people). And though it costs nothing to register with a location agency such as Lavish, a hot property on their books can net two or three shoots a week, at anything between \u00a3500 and \u00a31,000 a day. </p> <p>So what, in the current scheme of things, constitutes a hot property? According to Anna Darby (who has thousands of registered locations, including numerous private houses suited to film and fashion), Tate's improved fortunes are down to a recent rush on \"shabby chic\", which, she explains, is \"totally, utterly, faded grandeur\" - Decadence with attitude, in other words. </p> <p>\"If there are ripped curtains, they must be expensive ripped curtains,\" says Darby. If the walls are pocked and the paintwork peeling, all the better - especially if they are authentic Georgian or Victorian. Cobwebs and cracked windows? Lovely. \"Dereliction looks so good with luxury clothes,\" she explains. </p> <p>Within the shabby chic class, there are other sub-categories, such as \"stately\" - decaying mansion, with distressed historic paintwork - and \"grunge\" - rat-infested blocks, 50s housing estates, scabby industrial spaces, damp basements, etc. </p> <p>According to Tiffany Parish of rival agency Amazing Space, grunge is very big right now, as is anything that looks vaguely American (to give a shoot that Chicago feel, say, you might get a high-rise apartment in, er, Croydon. New England? A clapboard cottage in Essex). But one of the biggest fashion location stories for this season is retro - \"completely, utterly authentic\" properties from the 50s, 60s or 70s. And if you were under the illusion that fashion models were always jetting off to exotic places (you know the sort of thing: the Ice Hotel in Jukkasjarvi or a desert hut in Ngamiland), then think again - one of Parish's hot spaces right now is a 70s house in the south London suburb of Streatham. </p> <p>Home to artist Celeste Braithwaite, it doesn't look much from the outside (architecturally, it is akin to a postwar municipal office in the public utilities sector). The inside is not very pretty, either - unless you happen to like Artex and varnished pine. But the property's untouched 70s features (indoor pool with poolside cocktail area, original kitchen units, tan leatherette seduction sofa with built-in drinks cabinet and sound-system) make it the ultimate retro fashion location. </p> <p>Like Naomi Tate, Braithwaite did not set out to attract photographers, and those alluring fees, to her home. She got into location work through a friend in television, who instantly spotted the house's potential. And though the sideline has taken a while to get going, her home provides an irregular but solid income. </p> <p>Her first booking was for an American magazine, Mademoiselle, involving \"a whole load of people from LA\". She's since had German Cosmopolitan and Harvey Nichols (which shot a surreal magazine advertisement there that consisted of unpopulated interiors on to which knitted bears were later superimposed). The most recent job is a forthcoming Gap fashion advertisement for Wallpaper* magazine, in which a group of nine models frolic around the swimming pool. As always, popular areas were the kitchen, the hallway and the naff-but-groovy bathroom with its yellow circular bath (roughly the colour of egg yolk) and brown carpet. </p> <p>By fashion-shoot standards, the Gap job involved an unusually large crowd (\"loads of hairdressers, make-up artists, a catering truck\"). But that's nothing when compared with a film crew. A television ad filmed in the house for a Polish internet bank involved at least 30 people, miles of wires and cables, a dog, a cockatiel, and some redecoration. \"It was the Polish crew that painted the kitchen,\" says Braithwaite, indicating an area of pond-weed green that used to be knotty pine. They also papered the hall - in 70s-style vinyl (she loves it). And there are other perks: \"The majority of clients leave the place tidier than it was before,\" says Braithwaite. </p> <p>Though the house is popular now, Braithwaite is the first to recognise that the passing of fashion's recent 70s phase will mean it will bring in less location work. And, anyway, she doesn't get anywhere near the conveyor belts of clients who go in and out of Trevyn McDowell's vast converted warehouse in Clerkenwell, east London. It is a minimalist space, says Anna Darby, who represents this property, too, but it is, she insists, \"feminine minimalist - minimalism with warmth\". Even so, no photographer worth their salt would be able to resist a couple of thousand square foot of light, white modernism.In fact, McDowell's apartment, and others like it, are the 21st-century equivalent of castles and stately homes - properties with a shelf life, even in fashion. </p> <p>McDowell, an actress (she played Doctor Lydgate's wife in the BBC's adaptation of Middlemarch) turned designer, runs Site Specific, a company that specialises in \"fit-outs\" for warehouse conversions. She registered her property with a location agency as a way of dealing with all the space-seeking photographers who kept ringing on her doorbell (\"Agencies take care of all the contracts and insurance\"). Her home has since been hired out for \"catalogue work, pop videos, celebrity interviews, loads of fashion shoots\" (Marie Claire, Debenhams, Next, M&amp;S, etc). </p> <p>When shoots are in progress, McDowell tends to hide away in an office below the living space: \"If I pop upstairs to get a jumper or something, I'll often find a male model in the bath or someone in the bed. It's quite invasive. Basically, you've got a big bunch of strangers in your home doing their own thing - you have to be able to cope with the disruption, and the wear and tear.\" There is nothing predictable about the disruption, either. \"I might have three shoots in one week and then nothing for two months.\" </p> <p>There are some properties, however, that will never get used. What puts Anna Darby off? </p> <p>\"Double yellow lines outside the house. Tiny rooms - rooms full of Damien Hirsts [familiar artworks present copyright problems]. People who ask, 'Will there be much damage to my lovely cream carpet?' The Outer Hebrides. Photographers will travel outside London, but there are limits.\" </p> <p>Even if none of these turn-offs applies, the fashion-location market is not an easy one to satisfy. Can you, for example, meet the enduring demand for concrete Brutalism (\"slightly sinister - very Russian looking\")? Or the new \"Dallas look with a touch of the 2000s\" (as seen in recent Versace ads, it's vaguely Italian-Baroque, all marble, chandeliers, real fur and big, expensive dogs)? And has anyone out there got a 30s house, panelled in light oak, slightly reminiscent of Citizen Kane or a Philip Marlowe movie; could be America, but preferably Hertfordshire? \"Everyone, but everyone, is asking for Deco Retro.\" </p>",

A few seasons later, and not only has minimalism been \"shagged to death, darling\", but Tate's flat is back in vogue (indeed, in Vogue). \"Suddenly, it took off again,\" squeals Darby. \"Now it's gone completely mad.\" Tate's recent clients include Tatler, Harpers &amp; Queen, German Elle, various fashion advertising agencies (\"I don't always pay much attention to who they are,\" she admits) and the photographer Corinne Day, who spent a day in her living room with Kate Moss shooting fashion stills for Vogue's Gold issue, published last December. For this, Day shot Moss lying on a bed of old gold brocade in a Sportmax tinsel mini; and, in another photograph, her legs, clad in Paco Rabanne's slashed chain-mail hipsters, sprawled across frayed damask upholstery. Moss also squatted on the original parquet flooring in \u00a32,000-worth of sequinned \"heirloom material\"; perched on the edge of a stool, eating what looks like an M&amp;S sandwich, in nothing but Roberto Cavalli lingerie, an \"amazing\" diamant\u00e9 suspender belt and vintage Vivienne Westwood boots. Behind her, a pair of disintegrating red silk curtains (circa 1800) fall into crumpled folds on to an antique Persian rug; there's a glimpse of genuine Victorian plaster; a hint of radiator piping - all lit by a pale wash of what looks like natural sunlight (though photographic lighting can fake it where necessary). Tate, a ballet dancer, did not set out to turn her apartment into a photography location. The Villa Medici number in her house was, after all, her own personal expression of home. But later, when a magazine article inspired her to try letting it out to photographers and film production companies, the place turned out to have everything they needed: big open spaces, lots of light, atmosphere and interesting photogenic features (period fireplaces, garden statuary, and pale but interesting walls are popular with fashion clients). Film companies tend to pay more, but, says Tate, they are \"extremely demanding - they just take over\". Fashion stills and other product photography is far less obtrusive(shorter hours, fewer people). And though it costs nothing to register with a location agency such as Lavish, a hot property on their books can net two or three shoots a week, at anything between \u00a3500 and \u00a31,000 a day. So what, in the current scheme of things, constitutes a hot property? According to Anna Darby (who has thousands of registered locations, including numerous private houses suited to film and fashion), Tate's improved fortunes are down to a recent rush on \"shabby chic\", which, she explains, is \"totally, utterly, faded grandeur\" - Decadence with attitude, in other words. \"If there are ripped curtains, they must be expensive ripped curtains,\" says Darby. If the walls are pocked and the paintwork peeling, all the better - especially if they are authentic Georgian or Victorian. Cobwebs and cracked windows? Lovely. \"Dereliction looks so good with luxury clothes,\" she explains. Within the shabby chic class, there are other sub-categories, such as \"stately\" - decaying mansion, with distressed historic paintwork - and \"grunge\" - rat-infested blocks, 50s housing estates, scabby industrial spaces, damp basements, etc. According to Tiffany Parish of rival agency Amazing Space, grunge is very big right now, as is anything that looks vaguely American (to give a shoot that Chicago feel, say, you might get a high-rise apartment in, er, Croydon. New England? A clapboard cottage in Essex). But one of the biggest fashion location stories for this season is retro - \"completely, utterly authentic\" properties from the 50s, 60s or 70s. And if you were under the illusion that fashion models were always jetting off to exotic places (you know the sort of thing: the Ice Hotel in Jukkasjarvi or a desert hut in Ngamiland), then think again - one of Parish's hot spaces right now is a 70s house in the south London suburb of Streatham. Home to artist Celeste Braithwaite, it doesn't look much from the outside (architecturally, it is akin to a postwar municipal office in the public utilities sector). The inside is not very pretty, either - unless you happen to like Artex and varnished pine. But the property's untouched 70s features (indoor pool with poolside cocktail area, original kitchen units, tan leatherette seduction sofa with built-in drinks cabinet and sound-system) make it the ultimate retro fashion location. Like Naomi Tate, Braithwaite did not set out to attract photographers, and those alluring fees, to her home. She got into location work through a friend in television, who instantly spotted the house's potential. And though the sideline has taken a while to get going, her home provides an irregular but solid income. Her first booking was for an American magazine, Mademoiselle, involving \"a whole load of people from LA\". She's since had German Cosmopolitan and Harvey Nichols (which shot a surreal magazine advertisement there that consisted of unpopulated interiors on to which knitted bears were later superimposed). The most recent job is a forthcoming Gap fashion advertisement for Wallpaper* magazine, in which a group of nine models frolic around the swimming pool. As always, popular areas were the kitchen, the hallway and the naff-but-groovy bathroom with its yellow circular bath (roughly the colour of egg yolk) and brown carpet. By fashion-shoot standards, the Gap job involved an unusually large crowd (\"loads of hairdressers, make-up artists, a catering truck\"). But that's nothing when compared with a film crew. A television ad filmed in the house for a Polish internet bank involved at least 30 people, miles of wires and cables, a dog, a cockatiel, and some redecoration. \"It was the Polish crew that painted the kitchen,\" says Braithwaite, indicating an area of pond-weed green that used to be knotty pine. They also papered the hall - in 70s-style vinyl (she loves it). And there are other perks: \"The majority of clients leave the place tidier than it was before,\" says Braithwaite. Though the house is popular now, Braithwaite is the first to recognise that the passing of fashion's recent 70s phase will mean it will bring in less location work. And, anyway, she doesn't get anywhere near the conveyor belts of clients who go in and out of Trevyn McDowell's vast converted warehouse in Clerkenwell, east London. It is a minimalist space, says Anna Darby, who represents this property, too, but it is, she insists, \"feminine minimalist - minimalism with warmth\". Even so, no photographer worth their salt would be able to resist a couple of thousand square foot of light, white modernism.In fact, McDowell's apartment, and others like it, are the 21st-century equivalent of castles and stately homes - properties with a shelf life, even in fashion. McDowell, an actress (she played Doctor Lydgate's wife in the BBC's adaptation of Middlemarch) turned designer, runs Site Specific, a company that specialises in \"fit-outs\" for warehouse conversions. She registered her property with a location agency as a way of dealing with all the space-seeking photographers who kept ringing on her doorbell (\"Agencies take care of all the contracts and insurance\"). Her home has since been hired out for \"catalogue work, pop videos, celebrity interviews, loads of fashion shoots\" (Marie Claire, Debenhams, Next, M&amp;S, etc). When shoots are in progress, McDowell tends to hide away in an office below the living space: \"If I pop upstairs to get a jumper or something, I'll often find a male model in the bath or someone in the bed. It's quite invasive. Basically, you've got a big bunch of strangers in your home doing their own thing - you have to be able to cope with the disruption, and the wear and tear.\" There is nothing predictable about the disruption, either. \"I might have three shoots in one week and then nothing for two months.\" There are some properties, however, that will never get used. What puts Anna Darby off? \"Double yellow lines outside the house. Tiny rooms - rooms full of Damien Hirsts [familiar artworks present copyright problems]. People who ask, 'Will there be much damage to my lovely cream carpet?' The Outer Hebrides. Photographers will travel outside London, but there are limits.\" Even if none of these turn-offs applies, the fashion-location market is not an easy one to satisfy. Can you, for example, meet the enduring demand for concrete Brutalism (\"slightly sinister - very Russian looking\")? Or the new \"Dallas look with a touch of the 2000s\" (as seen in recent Versace ads, it's vaguely Italian-Baroque, all marble, chandeliers, real fur and big, expensive dogs)? And has anyone out there got a 30s house, panelled in light oak, slightly reminiscent of Citizen Kane or a Philip Marlowe movie; could be America, but preferably Hertfordshire? \"Everyone, but everyone, is asking for Deco Retro.\"",

      "body": "<p>Today is Britain's first Holocaust Day, and already the row has started. January 27, Auschwitz's Liberation Day, is the symbolic memorial for the Jewish holocaust, and that will be the focus of a ceremony in Whitehall. The genocides in Bosnia, Cambodia and Rwanda will also be remembered. But what about the Armenians, whose holocaust was the first of the bloody 20th century? Originally they were to be excluded from the ceremony entirely. Following intensive pressure, the government has made a concession: a few Armenians have been invited to the event, and mention will be made of the hundreds of thousands of deaths in 1915. This immediately provoked an angry reaction from the Turks - without satisfying the Armenians who were planning to hold a silent vigil in protest outside the Home Office on the night before the ceremony.</p> <p>At the end of 1999, there was a collective feeling that the year 2000 would begin with a clean slate: the Jewish holocaust was part of the past century. That changed when the new millennium brought with it the David Irving trial, plunging British law into the sensitive area of holocaust-denial. Currently, Jewish writers and historians are making connections between holocaust deniers such as Irving and Turkey's refusal to accept the bloody anti-Armenian policies of the Ottoman Empire. And, across the sweep of the century, a real link between the Armenian and Jewish genocides becomes clear. Just as Hitler wanted a Nazi-dominated world that would be Judenrein (cleansed of its Jews), so in 1915 the Ottoman Empire wanted to construct a Turkic Muslim empire that would stretch from Istanbul to Manchuria. Armenia, an ancient Christian civilisation spreading out from the eastern end of the Black Sea, did not not fit into the plan. In a terrible coincidence, both Jews and Armenians lost a third of their population through genocide. Both are still recovering.</p> <p>Already, at the end of the 19th century, Ottoman Turks had murdered between 100,000 and 250,000 Armenians. We can now see that these pogroms were a warning of what was to happen in 1915. Tens of thousands fled. In 1901, Protestant missionary Theresa Huntington Ziegler chronicled a massive haemorrhaging of Armenians towards France, Egypt, Lebanon, South America, Palestine and the Sudan. Today, the majority of diaspora Armenians live in California.</p> <p>Who exactly are the Armenians? Their language is Indo-European and their culture dates back to more than 2,000 years BC. In AD303, as an act of collective identity against assimilation by the Persians, they were the first nation to declare Christianity a state religion. St Mesrob Mashtots is their literary hero. He created the 36-letter Armenian alphabet in AD405. Armenian culture is a multilayered heritage of music, dance, theatre, literature and extraordinary poetry. Armenia was an independent state in medieval times but was absorbed into the Ottoman Empire, from the 15th century right up until 1920 when it was briefly declared a republic. Two years later much of it became part of the USSR; now - with the break-up of the Soviet Union - there is once again a Republic of Armenia. The entire diaspora speaks western Armenian; only those living in this independent homeland of Armenia speak eastern Armenian, with its structural and phonological differences.</p> <p>A certain amount of romance has surrounded Armenian culture since the 19th century. Lord Byron went to Venice to study Armenian in the belief that \"Armenian is the language to speak with God\". William Gladstone said, \"to serve Armenia is to serve civilisation\". But, of course, geography is all. Armenia, in 1914, was uncomfortably sandwiched between the warring sides of Tsarist Russia and the sultanate of Mohammed V. In the first world war, conscripted Russian and Turkish Armenians, just like German and British Jews, were fighting their own cousins in the trenches.</p> <p>At the beginning of the last century, civil rights for European minorities became a serious issue. A modernisation of the Ottoman Empire was promised by the 1908 revolutionary movement of Young Turks, and Turkish Armenians hoped for equality. In fact, the Young Turks continued to target Armenians and other non-Muslims. As Sultan Abdul Hamid II put it, at the beginning of the century, \"The way to get rid of the Armenian Question is to get rid of the Armenians.\"</p> <p>In 1915, the Young Turks, who had deposed the old sultan, carried out a systematic final solution, through mass shootings, concentration camps, starvation, abandonment in the desert, even gassing and mass deportation. This happened despite conscription, the year before, of 250,000 Armenians into the Turkish army. Christopher Walker and David Marshall Lang, writing for a journal in the Minority Rights Group series, detail Armenian loyalty to the Empire during the first world war: \"When the Turkish war minister, Enver Pasha, was defeated by the Russians, it was the Armenian soldiers who saved him from being killed or captured by Tsarist forces.\" But, remembering the 1896 assassinations and recent pogroms, some Armenians joined the enemy Tsarist armies as volunteers. This helped the Ottomans portray the Armenians as a dangerous fifth column.</p> <p>By 1915, all Armenians had been forced to give up personal firearms. Armenians in the Ottoman army were assembled into labour battalions where they were starved, beaten or machine-gunned. On April 24, 1915, more than 300 Istanbul Armenian intellectuals were arrested and then murdered in a mini Katyn. This included MPs in the Turkish parliament. The Armenian community was now without able-bodied men and intellectuals. This lack of leadership was to have a profound political and emotional effect on the survivors. The loss is felt even today.</p> <p>Memories from this genocide make gruelling reading. There are stories of women's breasts being cut off. Others were systematically raped and then murdered. Some were taken to harems and disappeared. In every province, town and village of Turkish Armenia and Asia Minor, the entire Armenian population was rounded up. The men were usually shot, and the women and children forced to walk in huge convoys to the Syrian desert. Even today, skeletons are still found from this journey to hell. Few survived the death marches. Those who did get through made sure their experiences were passed down to children and grandchildren.</p> <p>Dr Susan Pattie, senior research fellow at University College London, is a 50-year-old US-born anthropologist. Her family was deported from the town of Kessab on the Turkish/Syrian border in 1915. Two of her grandmother's children died on the death marches and two more were taken away by Turks. (Many Armenian children were used as slave workers, others were adopted and converted; the rest disappeared.)</p> <p>Pattie, who grew up in Washington DC, has been profoundly affected by her grandmother's early tragedy. \"Although my father was American-English and my schoolfriends were mainly Jewish, I totally identified as Armenian, particularly as my grandmother lived with us. We were told about the deportation when we were growing up. It was part of being Armenian.\"</p> <p>Genocide was decided at government level. Locally, gendarmes carried out the mass murders together with a special organisation (Teshkilat-i Mahsusa) of convicted criminals who had been offered a pardon in return for slaughtering Armenians. Survivors from the death marches were held in the infamous Syrian open-air concentration camp of Deir el-Zor, where many were murdered by camp guards.</p> <p>Death came in various ways. In Trebizond, local Armenians were pushed on to boats then thrown overboard. Others were hurled off the edge of a gorge. Before 1914, more than two million Armenians lived in Turkey. After the genocide, only 500,000 remained, destined to become refugees in what was to become known as the Armenian diaspora.</p> <p>Talaat Pasha, Ottoman minister of the interior, was the genocide's main architect. He wrote, \"By continuing the deportation of the orphans to their destinations during the intense cold, we are ensuring their eternal rest.\" This uncannily prefigures the Nazis' welcoming of the Jews to Auschwitz with the sardonic words, \"Now you are on the road to Paradise.\"</p> <p>Jews bore witness to the Armenian holocaust from the start. Henry Morgenthau, a German-born Jew and America's ambassador to Turkey, protested fiercely to the US government in an attempt to force its intervention. Writing in the Red Cross Magazine in March 1918, he said, \"None of the fearful horrors perpetrated in the various zones of war can compare with the tragic lot of the Armenians.\" Morgenthau has become a hero to the Armenians. But Jewish sympathy did not provoke any international aid for the Armenians, whose extermination was being veiled under cover of war.</p> <p>After the war, France and Britain were anxious to seize whatever territory they could from the 1918 dismemberment of the Ottoman Empire. Palestine was to become a British mandate, the French took Syria and Lebanon. The fate of the Armenians was of little interest to the imperialist powers. In a 1915 dispatch, the Times war correspondent, J Norman, writes of \"husbands mourning their dishonoured wives, parents their murdered children, churches despoiled, graves dug up, young of both sexes carried off\". He describes men being forced to dig trenches for their own graves. These are disturbingly prophetic images of events 26 years later, when the Einsatzgruppen in the Soviet Union forced Jews to do the same.</p> <p>Turkey has never admitted to the genocide, but there are too many independent witnesses for its denial to be credible. The Reverend Henry H Riggs was an American missionary in the Ottoman Empire. His book, Days Of Tragedy In Armenia, is one of the most detailed genocide histories in English. The US National Archives have information on the slaughter and deportations on file and open to the public. There is even protest from Mehmet Sherif Pasha, former Turkish envoy to Sweden. Writing to the New York Times in 1921, he says, \"The Armenian atrocities perpetrated under the present regime surpass the savagery of Genghis Khan and Tamburlaine.\" Dr E Lovejoy of the executive board of the American Women's Hospital wrote to the Times, \"I was the first American Red Cross woman in France, but what I saw there during the Great War seems a love feast beside the horrors of Smyrna. When I arrived at Smyrna there were massed on the quays 250,000 wretched, suffering and screaming women beaten and with their clothes torn off, families separated and everybody robbed.\"</p> <p>The problem is that guilt admission sometimes takes centuries. The Vatican has taken nearly 1,000 years to apologise for the Crusades. Even in Britain, particular archives from both world wars remain closed, so it should be no surprise that the Turks are equally secretive. Historian Ara Sarafian notes how Ottoman archives fail to detail \"abandoned\" private properties or any compensation paid to individuals for \"resettlement\". He also details how \"no such records have emerged on the actual 'resettlement' [a euphemism for death] of the hundreds of thousands of Armenians deported during this period\". As recently as 1990, Turkey's ambassador to the US, Nuzhet Kandemir, claimed the Armenian deaths were, \"a result of a tragic civil war initiated by Armenian nationalists\".</p> <p>Public Armenian protest did not emerge until the 60s. Until then, survivors were too busy picking up their lives to start retribution claims. When recognition of the Jewish holocaust gradually filtered into the popular imagination in the 70s and 80s, the Armenians felt that their story was being upstaged, especially as constant Turkish denial helped bleach out the facts.</p> <p>In the late 70s and early 80s, the Armenian liberation army (ASALA) assassinated Turkish diplomats to focus media attention on the Armenian genocide. In July 1983, a Turkish diplomat was killed in Brussels. In Paris, six people died and 48 were wounded when a bomb exploded in front of the Turkish Airlines' check-in desk at Orly airport. ASALA killed 39 diplomats in a decade. Many of the gunmen were trained in Libya and had Palestinian connections. The Armenians have, at different times, identified with both Palestinians and Jews.</p> <p>At a conference held in Lausanne in 1983, 200 Armenians met to discuss the creation of an independent Armenian state in northeastern Turkey; a country that might extend into Soviet Armenia. These Armenians described themselves as \"something halfway between the World Jewish Congress and the Palestine National Council\". Their dream may have seemed utopian, but the idea of a Jewish homeland also appeared unrealistic at the first Zionist Congress in Basle in 1897. Although the Lausanne conference did not lead to direct political action, the assassinations stopped. Since then, the battle for who writes Armenian history has intensified, and the Armenians are beginning to gain ground.</p> <p>In 1985, the UN Committee on Human Rights published a report declaring the Ottoman Empire responsible for the massacres of the Armenians in 1915 and 1916. Two years later, the Council of Europe agreed that Turkey's refusal to recognise the genocide was an insurmountable obstacle to Turkey's admission to the EU. By the end of 2000, the European Parliament, France, Sweden, the Vatican and Italy finally acknowledged the Armenian genocide. Of the major powers, only the US, Canada and Britain still hold back.

There were similar murders of former Ottoman leaders in Rome and Tbilisi, Georgia. In March 1943, Talaat Pasha's remains were sent by Hitler from Berlin as a gift to the Turkish government. They were reinterred on Turkey's Hill of Liberty in a ceremony attended by the representatives of Hitler's ambassador to Turkey.

The book is based on the experiences of his grandparents, who fled to Jerusalem during the genocide before returning to Turkey in 1920. In 1955, Hacikyan was called up and spent 18 months in Izmir as a translator between the Turkish Port Detachment and Nato. As a soldier in uniform, he remembers stopping to go to the public toilet. Looking down, he saw that the urinal had been constructed from Armenian gravestones. Forty years after the mass murders, Turks were happily making people urinate on Armenian graves. He now lives in Canada, which has a large Armenian community. Here, there are very few - shamefully, only 200 Armenians were allowed to immigrate to Britain between the wars, whereas France absorbed 63,000.</p> <p>As the century ended, the Armenian Shoah seemed to fade out of public consciousness. There seemed to be just too many genocides to absorb.</p> <p>On July 26 last year, a group of British parliamentarians from both houses petitioned Tony Blair to recognise the mass killings of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire as genocide. The government refused - and the concession concerning today's Holocaust Day ceremony does not alter that. But the problem will not go away and, if prominent supporters of the Armenian cause are championing their case in the US and Israel, the debate is surely going to take root here. On September 27, eminent British Jewish historian Sir Martin Gilbert talked publicly about the Armenian genocide at Washington's Holocaust Museum in a deliberate attempt to push the issue deeper into Jewish consciousness.</p> <p>As Thomas B\u00fcrgenthal, an Auschwitz survivor, lawyer and member of the UN Human Rights Committee, says, \"I don't know why the Turks can't admit it, express sorrow and go on.

      "bodyText": "Today is Britain's first Holocaust Day, and already the row has started. January 27, Auschwitz's Liberation Day, is the symbolic memorial for the Jewish holocaust, and that will be the focus of a ceremony in Whitehall. The genocides in Bosnia, Cambodia and Rwanda will also be remembered. But what about the Armenians, whose holocaust was the first of the bloody 20th century? Originally they were to be excluded from the ceremony entirely. Following intensive pressure, the government has made a concession: a few Armenians have been invited to the event, and mention will be made of the hundreds of thousands of deaths in 1915. This immediately provoked an angry reaction from the Turks - without satisfying the Armenians who were planning to hold a silent vigil in protest outside the Home Office on the night before the ceremony. At the end of 1999, there was a collective feeling that the year 2000 would begin with a clean slate: the Jewish holocaust was part of the past century. That changed when the new millennium brought with it the David Irving trial, plunging British law into the sensitive area of holocaust-denial. Currently, Jewish writers and historians are making connections between holocaust deniers such as Irving and Turkey's refusal to accept the bloody anti-Armenian policies of the Ottoman Empire. And, across the sweep of the century, a real link between the Armenian and Jewish genocides becomes clear. Just as Hitler wanted a Nazi-dominated world that would be Judenrein (cleansed of its Jews), so in 1915 the Ottoman Empire wanted to construct a Turkic Muslim empire that would stretch from Istanbul to Manchuria. Armenia, an ancient Christian civilisation spreading out from the eastern end of the Black Sea, did not not fit into the plan. In a terrible coincidence, both Jews and Armenians lost a third of their population through genocide. Both are still recovering. Already, at the end of the 19th century, Ottoman Turks had murdered between 100,000 and 250,000 Armenians. We can now see that these pogroms were a warning of what was to happen in 1915. Tens of thousands fled. In 1901, Protestant missionary Theresa Huntington Ziegler chronicled a massive haemorrhaging of Armenians towards France, Egypt, Lebanon, South America, Palestine and the Sudan. Today, the majority of diaspora Armenians live in California. Who exactly are the Armenians? Their language is Indo-European and their culture dates back to more than 2,000 years BC. In AD303, as an act of collective identity against assimilation by the Persians, they were the first nation to declare Christianity a state religion. St Mesrob Mashtots is their literary hero. He created the 36-letter Armenian alphabet in AD405. Armenian culture is a multilayered heritage of music, dance, theatre, literature and extraordinary poetry. Armenia was an independent state in medieval times but was absorbed into the Ottoman Empire, from the 15th century right up until 1920 when it was briefly declared a republic. Two years later much of it became part of the USSR; now - with the break-up of the Soviet Union - there is once again a Republic of Armenia. The entire diaspora speaks western Armenian; only those living in this independent homeland of Armenia speak eastern Armenian, with its structural and phonological differences. A certain amount of romance has surrounded Armenian culture since the 19th century. Lord Byron went to Venice to study Armenian in the belief that \"Armenian is the language to speak with God\". William Gladstone said, \"to serve Armenia is to serve civilisation\". But, of course, geography is all. Armenia, in 1914, was uncomfortably sandwiched between the warring sides of Tsarist Russia and the sultanate of Mohammed V. In the first world war, conscripted Russian and Turkish Armenians, just like German and British Jews, were fighting their own cousins in the trenches. At the beginning of the last century, civil rights for European minorities became a serious issue. A modernisation of the Ottoman Empire was promised by the 1908 revolutionary movement of Young Turks, and Turkish Armenians hoped for equality. In fact, the Young Turks continued to target Armenians and other non-Muslims. As Sultan Abdul Hamid II put it, at the beginning of the century, \"The way to get rid of the Armenian Question is to get rid of the Armenians.\" In 1915, the Young Turks, who had deposed the old sultan, carried out a systematic final solution, through mass shootings, concentration camps, starvation, abandonment in the desert, even gassing and mass deportation. This happened despite conscription, the year before, of 250,000 Armenians into the Turkish army. Christopher Walker and David Marshall Lang, writing for a journal in the Minority Rights Group series, detail Armenian loyalty to the Empire during the first world war: \"When the Turkish war minister, Enver Pasha, was defeated by the Russians, it was the Armenian soldiers who saved him from being killed or captured by Tsarist forces.\" But, remembering the 1896 assassinations and recent pogroms, some Armenians joined the enemy Tsarist armies as volunteers. This helped the Ottomans portray the Armenians as a dangerous fifth column. By 1915, all Armenians had been forced to give up personal firearms. Armenians in the Ottoman army were assembled into labour battalions where they were starved, beaten or machine-gunned. On April 24, 1915, more than 300 Istanbul Armenian intellectuals were arrested and then murdered in a mini Katyn. This included MPs in the Turkish parliament. The Armenian community was now without able-bodied men and intellectuals. This lack of leadership was to have a profound political and emotional effect on the survivors. The loss is felt even today. Memories from this genocide make gruelling reading. There are stories of women's breasts being cut off. Others were systematically raped and then murdered. Some were taken to harems and disappeared. In every province, town and village of Turkish Armenia and Asia Minor, the entire Armenian population was rounded up. The men were usually shot, and the women and children forced to walk in huge convoys to the Syrian desert. Even today, skeletons are still found from this journey to hell. Few survived the death marches. Those who did get through made sure their experiences were passed down to children and grandchildren. Dr Susan Pattie, senior research fellow at University College London, is a 50-year-old US-born anthropologist. Her family was deported from the town of Kessab on the Turkish/Syrian border in 1915. Two of her grandmother's children died on the death marches and two more were taken away by Turks. (Many Armenian children were used as slave workers, others were adopted and converted; the rest disappeared.) Pattie, who grew up in Washington DC, has been profoundly affected by her grandmother's early tragedy. \"Although my father was American-English and my schoolfriends were mainly Jewish, I totally identified as Armenian, particularly as my grandmother lived with us. We were told about the deportation when we were growing up. It was part of being Armenian.\" Genocide was decided at government level. Locally, gendarmes carried out the mass murders together with a special organisation (Teshkilat-i Mahsusa) of convicted criminals who had been offered a pardon in return for slaughtering Armenians. Survivors from the death marches were held in the infamous Syrian open-air concentration camp of Deir el-Zor, where many were murdered by camp guards. Death came in various ways. In Trebizond, local Armenians were pushed on to boats then thrown overboard. Others were hurled off the edge of a gorge. Before 1914, more than two million Armenians lived in Turkey. After the genocide, only 500,000 remained, destined to become refugees in what was to become known as the Armenian diaspora. Talaat Pasha, Ottoman minister of the interior, was the genocide's main architect. He wrote, \"By continuing the deportation of the orphans to their destinations during the intense cold, we are ensuring their eternal rest.\" This uncannily prefigures the Nazis' welcoming of the Jews to Auschwitz with the sardonic words, \"Now you are on the road to Paradise.\" Jews bore witness to the Armenian holocaust from the start. Henry Morgenthau, a German-born Jew and America's ambassador to Turkey, protested fiercely to the US government in an attempt to force its intervention. Writing in the Red Cross Magazine in March 1918, he said, \"None of the fearful horrors perpetrated in the various zones of war can compare with the tragic lot of the Armenians.\" Morgenthau has become a hero to the Armenians. But Jewish sympathy did not provoke any international aid for the Armenians, whose extermination was being veiled under cover of war. After the war, France and Britain were anxious to seize whatever territory they could from the 1918 dismemberment of the Ottoman Empire. Palestine was to become a British mandate, the French took Syria and Lebanon. The fate of the Armenians was of little interest to the imperialist powers. In a 1915 dispatch, the Times war correspondent, J Norman, writes of \"husbands mourning their dishonoured wives, parents their murdered children, churches despoiled, graves dug up, young of both sexes carried off\". He describes men being forced to dig trenches for their own graves. These are disturbingly prophetic images of events 26 years later, when the Einsatzgruppen in the Soviet Union forced Jews to do the same. Turkey has never admitted to the genocide, but there are too many independent witnesses for its denial to be credible. The Reverend Henry H Riggs was an American missionary in the Ottoman Empire. His book, Days Of Tragedy In Armenia, is one of the most detailed genocide histories in English. The US National Archives have information on the slaughter and deportations on file and open to the public. There is even protest from Mehmet Sherif Pasha, former Turkish envoy to Sweden. Writing to the New York Times in 1921, he says, \"The Armenian atrocities perpetrated under the present regime surpass the savagery of Genghis Khan and Tamburlaine.\" Dr E Lovejoy of the executive board of the American Women's Hospital wrote to the Times, \"I was the first American Red Cross woman in France, but what I saw there during the Great War seems a love feast beside the horrors of Smyrna. When I arrived at Smyrna there were massed on the quays 250,000 wretched, suffering and screaming women beaten and with their clothes torn off, families separated and everybody robbed.\" The problem is that guilt admission sometimes takes centuries. The Vatican has taken nearly 1,000 years to apologise for the Crusades. Even in Britain, particular archives from both world wars remain closed, so it should be no surprise that the Turks are equally secretive. Historian Ara Sarafian notes how Ottoman archives fail to detail \"abandoned\" private properties or any compensation paid to individuals for \"resettlement\". He also details how \"no such records have emerged on the actual 'resettlement' [a euphemism for death] of the hundreds of thousands of Armenians deported during this period\". As recently as 1990, Turkey's ambassador to the US, Nuzhet Kandemir, claimed the Armenian deaths were, \"a result of a tragic civil war initiated by Armenian nationalists\". Public Armenian protest did not emerge until the 60s. Until then, survivors were too busy picking up their lives to start retribution claims. When recognition of the Jewish holocaust gradually filtered into the popular imagination in the 70s and 80s, the Armenians felt that their story was being upstaged, especially as constant Turkish denial helped bleach out the facts. In the late 70s and early 80s, the Armenian liberation army (ASALA) assassinated Turkish diplomats to focus media attention on the Armenian genocide. In July 1983, a Turkish diplomat was killed in Brussels. In Paris, six people died and 48 were wounded when a bomb exploded in front of the Turkish Airlines' check-in desk at Orly airport. ASALA killed 39 diplomats in a decade. Many of the gunmen were trained in Libya and had Palestinian connections. The Armenians have, at different times, identified with both Palestinians and Jews. At a conference held in Lausanne in 1983, 200 Armenians met to discuss the creation of an independent Armenian state in northeastern Turkey; a country that might extend into Soviet Armenia. These Armenians described themselves as \"something halfway between the World Jewish Congress and the Palestine National Council\". Their dream may have seemed utopian, but the idea of a Jewish homeland also appeared unrealistic at the first Zionist Congress in Basle in 1897. Although the Lausanne conference did not lead to direct political action, the assassinations stopped. Since then, the battle for who writes Armenian history has intensified, and the Armenians are beginning to gain ground. In 1985, the UN Committee on Human Rights published a report declaring the Ottoman Empire responsible for the massacres of the Armenians in 1915 and 1916. Two years later, the Council of Europe agreed that Turkey's refusal to recognise the genocide was an insurmountable obstacle to Turkey's admission to the EU. By the end of 2000, the European Parliament, France, Sweden, the Vatican and Italy finally acknowledged the Armenian genocide. Of the major powers, only the US, Canada and Britain still hold back. There are too many conflicting interests at stake. Turkey, for instance, threatened to deny the US use of its air bases if President Clinton agreed formally to accept the massacres as a genocide. Perhaps the Armenians' best hope is allegiance with the Jews, who have learnt the importance of stubbornly pursuing justice. They certainly have Jewish allies. But Jewish solidarity is not always certain. Turkey is one of Israel's few Muslim allies and the Israeli state has not wanted to alienate the Turks. Enlightened Jews in the diaspora are less circumspect. In 1988, the Israeli Knesset signed a statement acknowledging the Armenian massacres during the first world war without mentioning Turkey, whereas in the US the Jewish Reform movement condemned the Ottoman Turks for \"one of the most shameful events in history\".

There were similar murders of former Ottoman leaders in Rome and Tbilisi, Georgia. In March 1943, Talaat Pasha's remains were sent by Hitler from Berlin as a gift to the Turkish government. They were reinterred on Turkey's Hill of Liberty in a ceremony attended by the representatives of Hitler's ambassador to Turkey. Although Armenians are Christians, they are not turning the other cheek. Reverend Dr Nerses Nersessian, an Iranian-born Armenian scholar and priest, is the curator of the Hebrew and Christian Middle East section at the British Library. His Christian name is Vrej, a very popular first name for boys. Vrej means \"revenge\". Turkish-born Armenian author, Agop Hacikyan has written A Summer Without Dawn. The book is based on the experiences of his grandparents, who fled to Jerusalem during the genocide before returning to Turkey in 1920. In 1955, Hacikyan was called up and spent 18 months in Izmir as a translator between the Turkish Port Detachment and Nato. As a soldier in uniform, he remembers stopping to go to the public toilet. Looking down, he saw that the urinal had been constructed from Armenian gravestones. Forty years after the mass murders, Turks were happily making people urinate on Armenian graves. He now lives in Canada, which has a large Armenian community. Here, there are very few - shamefully, only 200 Armenians were allowed to immigrate to Britain between the wars, whereas France absorbed 63,000. As the century ended, the Armenian Shoah seemed to fade out of public consciousness. There seemed to be just too many genocides to absorb. On July 26 last year, a group of British parliamentarians from both houses petitioned Tony Blair to recognise the mass killings of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire as genocide. The government refused - and the concession concerning today's Holocaust Day ceremony does not alter that. But the problem will not go away and, if prominent supporters of the Armenian cause are championing their case in the US and Israel, the debate is surely going to take root here. On September 27, eminent British Jewish historian Sir Martin Gilbert talked publicly about the Armenian genocide at Washington's Holocaust Museum in a deliberate attempt to push the issue deeper into Jewish consciousness. As Thomas B\u00fcrgenthal, an Auschwitz survivor, lawyer and member of the UN Human Rights Committee, says, \"I don't know why the Turks can't admit it, express sorrow and go on. That is the worst. You do all these things to the victim and then you say it never happened. That is killing them twice.\"",

      "body": "<p>The 1996 log book at Venice's Vigili del Fuoco, the city's central fire brigade, records that Monday, January 29, was a largely uneventful day for the firefighters. As darkness fell, the men in C team reported for the night shift at the main station just off the Grand Canal and began settling down to play cards, watch TV, read the sports pages or doze on their bunkbeds. With the Christmas and New Year festivities long over and the carnival several weeks off, the old town centre was relatively empty. This inactivity, with the cold, damp, still air, made the risk of fire thankfully low.</p> <p>At 9pm the phone rang. A policeman patrolling the canals near Venice's 18th-century opera house, La Fenice, had seen smoke coming from somewhere near the theatre. As the alarm went off, the men ran down to their fire boats. \"We knew that if a fire had started anywhere near or in the theatre, we had to act fast,\" says Commandante Alfio Pini, head of the Vigili del Fuoco. \"The square where the theatre stands, in one of the oldest parts of Venice, is very small and crowded with old, mainly wooden buildings, restaurants, bars, hotels and homes all very close together, and the risk of a fire spreading fast is enormous.\"</p> <p>The canals and a small lagoon surrounding a major part of the theatre had recently been drained for the first time in 40 years for dredging and restoration work, and this would hinder access to the area and eliminate the nearest supply of canal water. When the team arrived at Campo San Fantin less than three minutes after 9pm, flames were shooting from an upstairs window at the side of La Fenice. By 9.10pm, the whole upper floor was a fireball. Here was every Venetian's nightmare come true. Most visitors to Venice remain unaware that, although the city is built on water and regularly flooded by high tides, fire is the most dreaded of all disasters. There were, until very recently, no fire hydrants in the streets. Without space on firm ground to erect a 100ft hydraulic ladder, firefighters here still rely on old-fashioned extending wooden ladders, which usually reach low levels only; the amount of equipment that can be transported on their fire boats is limited; and when high tides swell, the canals boats often have difficulty passing under many of the bridges.</p> <p>That night, outside La Fenice, the firefighters were forced to run their hoses from more distant canals, only to have insufficient pressure to tackle the spreading blaze. One bystander likened it to \"trying to put out the fires of hell with a garden hose\". At 9.20pm, the men watched helplessly as the floors and supporting structures of the sumptuous rococo salons and ornately gilded multi-tiered auditorium crashed in, and the stage collapsed in a roar of flames, showering the neighbourhood with embers.\"We only just managed to get clear when the floor and stage caved in - we saved ourselves by a hair,\" recalls one fireman. Pini and his men knew almost from the outset that there was no choice but to let La Fenice burn to the ground. They evacuated the surrounding buildings and then turned their hoses on them to prevent the fire from spreading. \"We had to choose between the theatre and the town: it was either save La Fenice or save Venice. So we switched from attack to control tactics. We got back-up from the mainland fire services, including a helicopter to collect water from the lagoon and spray the area from above. Luckily, there was no wind that night, which prevented a disaster. It was the worst fire the Vigili has ever worked on.\"</p> <p>When, at around 11pm, the theatre's roof collapsed with a massive explosion, shooting 50-metre flames into the air, the theatre became a virtual chimney whose blaze illuminated the whole sky, belching smoke over the city throughout the night and following day.</p> <p>This week, the fifth anniversary of the fire, vivid memories and intense emotions are likely to be revived as the story is retold, inevitably, in the many nearby bars and cafes. Few will have forgotten that night, or completely obliterated the shock and disbelief generated by the tragedy. Lady Clarke, president of Venice In Peril, the charity dedicated to preserving the city, was among the crowd of horrified onlookers. She stood throughout the night beside the mayor, who watched the fire with tears streaming down his face. Barbara di Valmerana, as the president of the opera house's main funding organisation, Friends of La Fenice, was distraught. To her, the scene resembled an image from the Vietnam war: \"I have never witnessed a war, but this seemed like the nearest thing to it. The helicopter up there was like a small useless toy battling the blaze. After a while, I didn't want to see any more - I was too sad - so I went home.\"</p> <p>The next day, as smoke and flames still curled from the crater piled with charred rubble and the blackened outer walls which were all that remained of La Fenice, di Valmerana opened a bank account for donations to fund its rebuilding, and to replace all the musical instruments, scores, sets and costumes that had been lost. Thankfully, the theatre's archives, containing countless historical documents, including Verdi's handwritten opera scores and letters, were housed elsewhere. Like all Venetians, Countess Valmerana went about her business with a heavy heart. But there was one thing of which she, like every citizen, was convinced: rebuilding what had been one of Europe's great opera houses for 200 years would be a top priority.</p> <p>At a press conference that day, the mayor, Massimo Cacciari, promised that La Fenice would be rebuilt \"com'era, dov'era\" - as it was, where it was - a much used phrase that encapsulates the city's sense of heritage and was the rallying cry for the rebuilding of a replica of the 14th-century bell tower in St Mark's Square, which collapsed in 1902. Cacciari also added, unwisely, that there would be no delay, with December 1999 the estimated reopening date.</p> <p>The mayor, a former philosophy teacher, was acutely aware of the symbolism behind his promise. When the opera house opened at its present site on Campo San Fantin in 1792, it was named La Fenice - the Phoenix - not only because its half- completed structure was destroyed by fire in 1790, but also because it was intended to replace the nearby Teatro San Benedetto, which had burned down 18 years earlier. La Fenice was again destroyed by fire in 1836, when it was rebuilt in 10 months. Who could doubt that the Phoenix would rise again?</p> <p>Funds began rolling in almost immediately. The newspaper La Repubblica raised nearly $1m in four days. Generous donations came from America, Britain and the rest of Europe. Even Venice's prostitutes gave the mayor three million lire for the theatre, citing their appreciation of Venice's health and social rehabilitation programmes. The government immediately allocated 20 billion lire (approaching $10m) for the reconstruction project, and put the Prefect of Venice in charge of the project, with special powers to sidestep regulations covering restoration.</p> <p>La Fenice had been one of the world's great opera houses, with famously perfect acoustics and an impressive artistic legacy; its loss was a tragedy for artists and opera lovers throughout the world. \"It was like suddenly losing something you thought was immortal,\" declared Riccardo Muti, musical director of Milan's La Scala. With its majestic foyers and glittering auditorium, decorated with gilt, frescoes and Murano glass chandeliers, it was the most entrancing of opera houses. As Luciano Pavarotti said the morning after the fire, \"La Fenice was a jewel and architecturally the most beautiful theatre in Italy\", and then he volunteered to sing in a benefit concert in St Mark's Square.</p> <p>The renowned mezzo-soprano Regina Resnik, who lives in Venice, remembers watching the fire with her husband, the designer Arbit Blatas. \"We both wept like children. It was heartbreaking. It was at La Fenice that many great works, including La Traviata, Rigoletto and Simon Boccanegra, were first performed.\"</p> <p>Count Girolamo Marcello saw the blaze from his nearby palazzo. From the first flames, he knew it was the end of the theatre - and of a piece of social history. He still has the brass key to one of the three private boxes owned by his family since the 1700s. \"In the old days, you went to La Fenice not for the opera but to see and be seen. In winter, it was cheaper and more convivial to spend the evenings in a private box than to heat a palazzo. With the curtains drawn, one was served dinner by one's own servants and only opened the curtains for highlights on the stage.\"</p> <p>To reassure the public that steps to tackle the disaster were being taken, the city authorities, with uncharacteristic promptness, announced a plan of action. A new temporary home was to be built outside the centre of Venice for the Fenice Opera Company, which was touring abroad when the fire broke out. The new Pala Fenice, a 3,000-seater tent with adjoining Portakabins, was constructed at Tronchetto, the vast city car park on an island connected to the outskirts of Venice, and opened on March 22, in time for the company's 1996 season. Meanwhile, the prefecture announced there would be an international competition for the reconstruction of the theatre.</p> <p>Meanwhile a major inquiry into the cause of the disaster began. While early reports attributed the fire to a probable electrical short-circuit, no one who witnessed the speed and ferocity with which the flames ravaged the building took this seriously. Even Mayor Cacciari was dubious: \"The fire didn't start by itself. Those responsible, if there are people responsible, will be punished,\" he said ominously as the city's public prosecutor, Felice Casson, began his investigation. And, in the following months, as investigators collected eyewitness accounts and forensic evidence, it became clear that, far from being an accident, the devastation of La Fenice was either due to negligence on a spectacular scale or had been a meticulously planned crime. The more damning the facts that emerged, the more likely the explanation that the fire was caused by a combination of crime and negligence.</p> <p>Most suspicious was the fact that, at the time of the blaze, La Fenice had been closed for five months for extensive renovations. The work - which was nearly finished, with the theatre scheduled to re-open in March 1996 - included the replacing of electrical wiring, the relaying of wooden floors, and the installation of a new fire alarm and sprinkler system to bring the theatre up to date with new government and EU safety regulations. The building was constructed throughout mainly of wood. However, none of those responsible for its day-to-day running, upkeep or refurbishment - not the Venice city council, the theatre's general manager, or the building firms contracted to work there - had maintained even the most basic of safety measures.</p> <p>Quite the contrary. On the night of January 29, only one stage doorman was on duty throughout the entire premises. And this despite the draining of the surrounding canals. Several containers of gas and highly inflammable material had been left lying around in areas that were still being refurbished, many of them dangerously close to exposed electrical circuitry and gas or motor-driven tools such as soldering irons and blowtorches. \"Had our men not entered the burning theatre at the start of the blaze and retrieved several cylinders of gas,\" says Commandante Pini, \"there would have been massive explosions resulting in extensive damage and probable loss of life.\"</p> <p>Fire doors and some windows had also been left wide open; the old fire alarm system, which was about to be replaced, had been disconnected, even though recent tests had showed that it was still functioning, and someone had switched off all the theatre's smoke alarms.</p> <p>The Venice fire service's report, after six months' forensic analysis and numerous reconstructions of the fire by incendiary experts, concluded that the blaze had been caused by someone, or something, igniting wooden planks that were impregnated with highly inflammable material.</p> <p>It isn't merely how the blaze began, but where, that strongly points to arson. The planks in question were part of new flooring being laid in a rehearsal room and in the third floor foyer, the Salle Apollin\u00e9e, explains Pini. \"We know the Apollin\u00e9e is where the fire started. All the high-risk areas, where wires might have been touching, were destroyed after the blaze began elsewhere.\" He has no doubt that it was arson, but hesitates about using the word on record. \"What I can say is that the fire was provoked, by the accelerant in the wood. It was not an accident. Open windows and doors allowed a current of air to suck the fire through very rapidly.\"</p> <p>Even before Pini's report was released, most Italians, suspecting the worst, had stopped wondering how La Fenice burned down and instead began asking who did it, and why. Several months into the enquiry, two electricians who had been working in the theatre for some weeks before the blaze were arrested and charged with setting fire to the building to avoid paying contractual penalties if the work was not completed by the following week. The idea seemed implausible, even absurd. Could the prospect of sums amounting to no more than the equivalent of several thousand pounds, which would anyway have been paid by their employer, have driven the men to such extremes? Especially when most building projects are delayed, especially in Italy? The men denied all charges, and the mystery grew.</p> <p>There was one obvious kneejerk reaction: for many people, crime in Italy means one thing, the mafia. Why should the destruction of La Fenice be an exception? Despite the absence of any hard evidence, there were enough rumours and unsubstantiated claims for the public prosecutor to investigate possible leads. Although the mafia has no obvious foothold in the art world, and would have had no apparent motive for burning down La Fenice, it had been responsible in the past for the bombing of the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, the Church of St John Lateran in Rome and Milan's Gallery of Modern Art, as well as scores of art robberies and various other attempts to damage cultural institutions.</p> <p>Those apparently motiveless attacks took place in the mid-90s, after the government had declared all-out war on organised crime and several highly publicised trials involving prominent mafia leaders were underway. The bombings, according to Italy's Direzione Investigativa Anti-Mafia (DIA), set up by the government to crack down on organised crime, were intended as a show of strength and a warning to politicians and judges to back off.</p> <p>According to one report, a Sicilian pentito (turncoat) had overheard a prominent mafioso ordering the destruction of La Fenice to intimidate the judges in the trial of mafia suspects for the murders in Palermo of Judge Giovanni Falcone, his wife and bodyguards in 1992, which for security reasons had been temporarily transferred to nearby Mestre. But all the conjecture was without a shred of evidence, and soon hit a dead end.</p> <p>But what if there were mobsters closer to home who wanted to show their muscle? In fact, the Venice region has its own \"Mafia del Brenta\". Once headed by the flashy, champagne-swigging Felice \"Angel Face\" Maniero, it is said to have strong ties with the city's casino and waterboat business, and had been behind several well-publicised art robberies. Maniero, so the DIA discovered, also had ties with another sub-division of the mafia, the \"sacra coronata unita\", based in Bari, on the southern Adriatic coast. This development worried Casson's investigators in particular, because the Fenice fire had a great deal in common with the burning down in 1991 of Bari's Petruzzelli Opera House. Its general manager, who had run up extensive debts with local loan sharks, was convicted, in 1998, of arson, together with several mafia bosses, who had been promised contracts for the rebuilding of the theatre.</p> <p>It was originally Carlo Maria Capristo, Bari's deputy chief prosecutor, then involved in the trial of those charged with the Bari opera blaze, who noticed the startling similarities between the fires that had gutted the two great opera houses. In particular, he was struck by a series of photographs recording every stage of the fire at La Fenice, taken by Graziano Arici, La Fenice's official photographer, who lives a few hundred metres from the theatre.</p> <p>Arici had been hurrying past the theatre to dinner at a nearby restaurant on the evening of January 29. Noticing flames at a window on the left side of the theatre, he ran back for his camera and started taking pictures, continuing throughout the night from the top of a building opposite the theatre.</p> <p>When Capristo studied Arici's photographs and compared them to a set of stills from an amateur video of the Petruzzelli fire, his view was that \"the photos are so alike they could be photocopies\", pointing out that both fires had spread horizontally and at lightning speed, a pattern he claims is indicative of arson. The fact that the Bari fire was the mafia's handiwork added further to speculation that the Venetian mafia might in some way be implicated in the destruction of La Fenice. According to Capristo, the motive is likely to have been the same as in Bari: the prospect of lucrative reconstruction contracts. However, despite extensive investigations - before and during the proceedings, which began in May 1999, against the two electricians charged with causing the fire - the \"mafia trail\" has, so far, led nowhere.</p> <p>All of which does not rule out the possibility that someone else had a vested interest in bribing the electricians to set the blaze. According to testimony by a former cellmate of Enrico Carella, one of the electricians on trial, Carella had confided in him that someone had ordered him to put the theatre to the torch in return for 150 million lire (\u00a350,000). In a previous hearing, the court had heard that Carella had debts for that same amount. He told his cellmate that the destruction of the theatre \"was a question of contracts\" and that he carried out the arson because he needed the money. He also named the people who had paid him. At this point the prosecutor barred the cellmate from giving further evidence on the grounds that the matter was under investigation, leaving yet another loose end to be tied up in the trial, which is set to continue until Easter, if not autumn.</p> <p>Although his photographs have been used as forensic evidence, Arici - like many of those familiar with the case - dismisses both the \"mafia connection\" and the arson theory as speculative rubbish. At a computer in his studio, he clicks through his reportage of the blaze. Although the rapid spread of the flames becomes more evident with each close-up, he claims the pictures do not prove anything. \"Some experts say the only way a fire could travel so fast from one side of the theatre to the other, with a wall in between, is if there were two, maybe three separate fires. Well, it may appear so, but with the inflammable material stored there, the dry, honeycombed wood throughout, and the draught from the open doors, the fast crossover makes complete sense.\"</p> <p>Arici believes that the prosecutor is misguided in charging the two electricians with arson, and is convinced that the fire was nothing more sinister than a tragic combination of circumstances. \"The danger involved in setting fire to a theatre, especially one with such a confusing layout as La Fenice, would put off anybody. I've known it for 20 years and was always getting lost. It was a rabbit warren. They couldn't have started a fire in that area and been sure of escaping in time through the labyrinth of staircases, corridors, steps, doors, turnings, dead ends. Being late with the renovation, they tried to speed things up a bit, were perhaps using something like a blowtorch, and some sparks fell somewhere. Or maybe they did want to do a little damage, an excuse to extend the deadline, and got scared when things went out of control. To destroy a whole theatre and risk your life just to avoid paying a fine of a few million lire would be unbelievable. The more important issue is that lack of security remains a fact, whether this was an accident or not.\"</p> <p>And there, Arici has put his finger on far more shameful aspects of the case. No one knows more about the scandalously lax administrative standards and wanton disregard for the theatre's security than the stage door-keeper and \"concierge\", Gilberto Paggiaro. To his dismay, Paggiaro, who has worked at La Fenice since 1984, has been charged with \"culpable negligence\", along with the theatre's former general manager, its chief administrative supremo, the former mayor Massimo Cacciari (in his capacity at the time as representing the building's owners, the city council) and five surveyors and engineers, who are accused of failing to implement adequate safety measures during the theatre's refurbishment.</p> <p>As far as Paggiaro is concerned, the administrative rot was all-pervasive and nothing new. \"There has always been a problem with staffing La Fenice,\" he says. \"For years I'd been telling the management that I'm often alone on duty. Although there are three other caretakers, for many reasons they may not be there, and one man cannot properly supervise the theatre's safety. Their answer was always, 'It's too expensive to hire more staff.'\"</p> <p>Between August 1995 and January 1996, Paggiaro was under added pressure, having to monitor the comings and goings of the 50 staff members who had continued working in the theatre's offices for the duration of the refurbishment, while also keeping an eye on a daily influx of another 50 or more strangers - builders on varying shifts from different firms and casual shift workers whom he didn't recognise, as well as tourists who would wander in to look around and take photographs.</p> <p>\"The smoke alarm, which was installed in front of my office, used to go off with fumes from building works, so they had unplugged it weeks earlier. But no one thought it important to have a fireman on duty through the night, or to arrange for a hose to be connected to a central water supply since the surrounding canals were empty, just in case something happened.\"</p> <p>Paggiaro's claims are backed up by recent evidence given by an engineer who was in charge of managing the site until the builders moved in. The engineer, who had tested the theatre's old firefighting equipment shortly before it was disconnected and found it in perfect working order, had at the time suggested that some empty cisterns, buried for years under the building but still watertight, could be used now to provide 200,000 litres of water in case of emergency. His proposal was not taken seriously, not even when, on January 12, a fire broke out following the overheating of metal on a piece of equipment that had been placed too close to a wooden beam. On that occasion, the fire had been put out quickly, because workmen were still on the site.</p> <p>Only a month previously, says Paggiaro, a surveyor from the Prefect's office began drawing up revised safety regulations. \"Even then, the administrators put off any decision about implementing those rules. They said it wasn't urgent, and that the various building firms should take responsibility for safety. The builders said it was the theatre's responsibility. Each one passed the buck to the other.\"</p> <p>On the night of January 29, Paggiaro began making his safety rounds at about 8.30pm when he smelled smoke.\"I thought it was outside, perhaps from one of the restaurants next door. I looked into the street but saw nothing. It was strong enough for me to put a handkerchief to my mouth, but I carried on with my rounds. All at once, I saw flames and lots of smoke reflected in a mirror on an upstairs landing outside the Salle Apollin\u00e9e.\" Running downstairs to his office, he phoned the Vigili del Fuoco, which told him that the incident had already been reported.</p> <p>By then, the smoke was getting thicker and sparks were flying. \"I waited a few minutes for the firemen, and when they didn't come I got frightened and went out into the square - and ran into Graziano Arici taking pictures of the blaze.\" What upsets him most, as an experienced veteran employee of the theatre, is the suggestion that he was negligent in reporting the blaze early enough because he was asleep, drunk or watching TV when it began.\"Had the smoke detector not been disconnected, I obviously would have known something was wrong and raised the alarm far earlier.\"</p> <p>The majority of Venetians regard the Fenice affair with weary resignation. Shock and sadness over the disaster, followed by a collective determination to triumph over adversity, has been superseded either by embarrassment or a near cynical indifference. Even the whodunnit element has lost its grip, as the trial drags into its fourth year, and all 10 defendants, apart from the two electricians, have moved on to other jobs. Besides, they now have a new focus for their anger: the five-year debacle over the rebuilding of La Fenice.</p> <p>Today, the site is little more than a vast, spectral ruin, desolate as a war zone, open to the sky, its facade and outer walls clad in scaffolding, plastic sheeting, and boarded up outside. Inside, large cranes, transported, like all materials and machinery in Venice, piecemeal by boat along the canals and assembled on site, stand idle in the swirling winter fog. Underfoot, the ground, mostly rubble, remains soggy after recent weeks of unusually severe \"aqua alta\" - the annual high tides that are steadily eating away at Venice's fragile and diseased substructure. Here a fragment of marble, there an isolated neo-classical column propped up by wooden posts, elsewhere a ragged section of dusty-pink fresco are poignant reminders of what was lost and how much has yet to be rebuilt. With few builders on the site and no work apparently in progress due to a new, acrimonious dispute over costs and scheduling between the German-Italian construction firm, Holzmann-Romagnoli, and the town council, the sense of doom is as crushing as an operatic tragedy.</p> <p>\u0095 Read the rest of this article <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/weekend/story/0,3605,429402,00.html\">here </a></p>",

They evacuated the surrounding buildings and then turned their hoses on them to prevent the fire from spreading. \"We had to choose between the theatre and the town: it was either save La Fenice or save Venice. So we switched from attack to control tactics. We got back-up from the mainland fire services, including a helicopter to collect water from the lagoon and spray the area from above. Luckily, there was no wind that night, which prevented a disaster. It was the worst fire the Vigili has ever worked on.\" When, at around 11pm, the theatre's roof collapsed with a massive explosion, shooting 50-metre flames into the air, the theatre became a virtual chimney whose blaze illuminated the whole sky, belching smoke over the city throughout the night and following day. This week, the fifth anniversary of the fire, vivid memories and intense emotions are likely to be revived as the story is retold, inevitably, in the many nearby bars and cafes. Few will have forgotten that night, or completely obliterated the shock and disbelief generated by the tragedy. Lady Clarke, president of Venice In Peril, the charity dedicated to preserving the city, was among the crowd of horrified onlookers. She stood throughout the night beside the mayor, who watched the fire with tears streaming down his face. Barbara di Valmerana, as the president of the opera house's main funding organisation, Friends of La Fenice, was distraught. To her, the scene resembled an image from the Vietnam war: \"I have never witnessed a war, but this seemed like the nearest thing to it. The helicopter up there was like a small useless toy battling the blaze. After a while, I didn't want to see any more - I was too sad - so I went home.\" The next day, as smoke and flames still curled from the crater piled with charred rubble and the blackened outer walls which were all that remained of La Fenice, di Valmerana opened a bank account for donations to fund its rebuilding, and to replace all the musical instruments, scores, sets and costumes that had been lost. Thankfully, the theatre's archives, containing countless historical documents, including Verdi's handwritten opera scores and letters, were housed elsewhere. Like all Venetians, Countess Valmerana went about her business with a heavy heart. But there was one thing of which she, like every citizen, was convinced: rebuilding what had been one of Europe's great opera houses for 200 years would be a top priority. At a press conference that day, the mayor, Massimo Cacciari, promised that La Fenice would be rebuilt \"com'era, dov'era\" - as it was, where it was - a much used phrase that encapsulates the city's sense of heritage and was the rallying cry for the rebuilding of a replica of the 14th-century bell tower in St Mark's Square, which collapsed in 1902. Cacciari also added, unwisely, that there would be no delay, with December 1999 the estimated reopening date. The mayor, a former philosophy teacher, was acutely aware of the symbolism behind his promise. When the opera house opened at its present site on Campo San Fantin in 1792, it was named La Fenice - the Phoenix - not only because its half- completed structure was destroyed by fire in 1790, but also because it was intended to replace the nearby Teatro San Benedetto, which had burned down 18 years earlier. La Fenice was again destroyed by fire in 1836, when it was rebuilt in 10 months. Who could doubt that the Phoenix would rise again? Funds began rolling in almost immediately. The newspaper La Repubblica raised nearly $1m in four days. Generous donations came from America, Britain and the rest of Europe. Even Venice's prostitutes gave the mayor three million lire for the theatre, citing their appreciation of Venice's health and social rehabilitation programmes. The government immediately allocated 20 billion lire (approaching $10m) for the reconstruction project, and put the Prefect of Venice in charge of the project, with special powers to sidestep regulations covering restoration. La Fenice had been one of the world's great opera houses, with famously perfect acoustics and an impressive artistic legacy; its loss was a tragedy for artists and opera lovers throughout the world. \"It was like suddenly losing something you thought was immortal,\" declared Riccardo Muti, musical director of Milan's La Scala. With its majestic foyers and glittering auditorium, decorated with gilt, frescoes and Murano glass chandeliers, it was the most entrancing of opera houses. As Luciano Pavarotti said the morning after the fire, \"La Fenice was a jewel and architecturally the most beautiful theatre in Italy\", and then he volunteered to sing in a benefit concert in St Mark's Square. The renowned mezzo-soprano Regina Resnik, who lives in Venice, remembers watching the fire with her husband, the designer Arbit Blatas. \"We both wept like children. It was heartbreaking. It was at La Fenice that many great works, including La Traviata, Rigoletto and Simon Boccanegra, were first performed.\" Count Girolamo Marcello saw the blaze from his nearby palazzo. From the first flames, he knew it was the end of the theatre - and of a piece of social history. He still has the brass key to one of the three private boxes owned by his family since the 1700s. \"In the old days, you went to La Fenice not for the opera but to see and be seen. In winter, it was cheaper and more convivial to spend the evenings in a private box than to heat a palazzo. With the curtains drawn, one was served dinner by one's own servants and only opened the curtains for highlights on the stage.\" To reassure the public that steps to tackle the disaster were being taken, the city authorities, with uncharacteristic promptness, announced a plan of action. A new temporary home was to be built outside the centre of Venice for the Fenice Opera Company, which was touring abroad when the fire broke out. The new Pala Fenice, a 3,000-seater tent with adjoining Portakabins, was constructed at Tronchetto, the vast city car park on an island connected to the outskirts of Venice, and opened on March 22, in time for the company's 1996 season. Meanwhile, the prefecture announced there would be an international competition for the reconstruction of the theatre. Meanwhile a major inquiry into the cause of the disaster began. While early reports attributed the fire to a probable electrical short-circuit, no one who witnessed the speed and ferocity with which the flames ravaged the building took this seriously. Even Mayor Cacciari was dubious: \"The fire didn't start by itself. Those responsible, if there are people responsible, will be punished,\" he said ominously as the city's public prosecutor, Felice Casson, began his investigation. And, in the following months, as investigators collected eyewitness accounts and forensic evidence, it became clear that, far from being an accident, the devastation of La Fenice was either due to negligence on a spectacular scale or had been a meticulously planned crime. The more damning the facts that emerged, the more likely the explanation that the fire was caused by a combination of crime and negligence. Most suspicious was the fact that, at the time of the blaze, La Fenice had been closed for five months for extensive renovations. The work - which was nearly finished, with the theatre scheduled to re-open in March 1996 - included the replacing of electrical wiring, the relaying of wooden floors, and the installation of a new fire alarm and sprinkler system to bring the theatre up to date with new government and EU safety regulations. The building was constructed throughout mainly of wood. However, none of those responsible for its day-to-day running, upkeep or refurbishment - not the Venice city council, the theatre's general manager, or the building firms contracted to work there - had maintained even the most basic of safety measures. Quite the contrary. On the night of January 29, only one stage doorman was on duty throughout the entire premises. And this despite the draining of the surrounding canals. Several containers of gas and highly inflammable material had been left lying around in areas that were still being refurbished, many of them dangerously close to exposed electrical circuitry and gas or motor-driven tools such as soldering irons and blowtorches. \"Had our men not entered the burning theatre at the start of the blaze and retrieved several cylinders of gas,\" says Commandante Pini, \"there would have been massive explosions resulting in extensive damage and probable loss of life.\" Fire doors and some windows had also been left wide open; the old fire alarm system, which was about to be replaced, had been disconnected, even though recent tests had showed that it was still functioning, and someone had switched off all the theatre's smoke alarms. The Venice fire service's report, after six months' forensic analysis and numerous reconstructions of the fire by incendiary experts, concluded that the blaze had been caused by someone, or something, igniting wooden planks that were impregnated with highly inflammable material. It isn't merely how the blaze began, but where, that strongly points to arson. The planks in question were part of new flooring being laid in a rehearsal room and in the third floor foyer, the Salle Apollin\u00e9e, explains Pini. \"We know the Apollin\u00e9e is where the fire started. All the high-risk areas, where wires might have been touching, were destroyed after the blaze began elsewhere.\" He has no doubt that it was arson, but hesitates about using the word on record. \"What I can say is that the fire was provoked, by the accelerant in the wood. It was not an accident. Open windows and doors allowed a current of air to suck the fire through very rapidly.\" Even before Pini's report was released, most Italians, suspecting the worst, had stopped wondering how La Fenice burned down and instead began asking who did it, and why. Several months into the enquiry, two electricians who had been working in the theatre for some weeks before the blaze were arrested and charged with setting fire to the building to avoid paying contractual penalties if the work was not completed by the following week. The idea seemed implausible, even absurd. Could the prospect of sums amounting to no more than the equivalent of several thousand pounds, which would anyway have been paid by their employer, have driven the men to such extremes? Especially when most building projects are delayed, especially in Italy? The men denied all charges, and the mystery grew. There was one obvious kneejerk reaction: for many people, crime in Italy means one thing, the mafia. Why should the destruction of La Fenice be an exception? Despite the absence of any hard evidence, there were enough rumours and unsubstantiated claims for the public prosecutor to investigate possible leads. Although the mafia has no obvious foothold in the art world, and would have had no apparent motive for burning down La Fenice, it had been responsible in the past for the bombing of the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, the Church of St John Lateran in Rome and Milan's Gallery of Modern Art, as well as scores of art robberies and various other attempts to damage cultural institutions. Those apparently motiveless attacks took place in the mid-90s, after the government had declared all-out war on organised crime and several highly publicised trials involving prominent mafia leaders were underway. The bombings, according to Italy's Direzione Investigativa Anti-Mafia (DIA), set up by the government to crack down on organised crime, were intended as a show of strength and a warning to politicians and judges to back off. According to one report, a Sicilian pentito (turncoat) had overheard a prominent mafioso ordering the destruction of La Fenice to intimidate the judges in the trial of mafia suspects for the murders in Palermo of Judge Giovanni Falcone, his wife and bodyguards in 1992, which for security reasons had been temporarily transferred to nearby Mestre. But all the conjecture was without a shred of evidence, and soon hit a dead end. But what if there were mobsters closer to home who wanted to show their muscle? In fact, the Venice region has its own \"Mafia del Brenta\". Once headed by the flashy, champagne-swigging Felice \"Angel Face\" Maniero, it is said to have strong ties with the city's casino and waterboat business, and had been behind several well-publicised art robberies. Maniero, so the DIA discovered, also had ties with another sub-division of the mafia, the \"sacra coronata unita\", based in Bari, on the southern Adriatic coast. This development worried Casson's investigators in particular, because the Fenice fire had a great deal in common with the burning down in 1991 of Bari's Petruzzelli Opera House. Its general manager, who had run up extensive debts with local loan sharks, was convicted, in 1998, of arson, together with several mafia bosses, who had been promised contracts for the rebuilding of the theatre. It was originally Carlo Maria Capristo, Bari's deputy chief prosecutor, then involved in the trial of those charged with the Bari opera blaze, who noticed the startling similarities between the fires that had gutted the two great opera houses. In particular, he was struck by a series of photographs recording every stage of the fire at La Fenice, taken by Graziano Arici, La Fenice's official photographer, who lives a few hundred metres from the theatre. Arici had been hurrying past the theatre to dinner at a nearby restaurant on the evening of January 29. Noticing flames at a window on the left side of the theatre, he ran back for his camera and started taking pictures, continuing throughout the night from the top of a building opposite the theatre. When Capristo studied Arici's photographs and compared them to a set of stills from an amateur video of the Petruzzelli fire, his view was that \"the photos are so alike they could be photocopies\", pointing out that both fires had spread horizontally and at lightning speed, a pattern he claims is indicative of arson. The fact that the Bari fire was the mafia's handiwork added further to speculation that the Venetian mafia might in some way be implicated in the destruction of La Fenice. According to Capristo, the motive is likely to have been the same as in Bari: the prospect of lucrative reconstruction contracts. However, despite extensive investigations - before and during the proceedings, which began in May 1999, against the two electricians charged with causing the fire - the \"mafia trail\" has, so far, led nowhere. All of which does not rule out the possibility that someone else had a vested interest in bribing the electricians to set the blaze. According to testimony by a former cellmate of Enrico Carella, one of the electricians on trial, Carella had confided in him that someone had ordered him to put the theatre to the torch in return for 150 million lire (\u00a350,000). In a previous hearing, the court had heard that Carella had debts for that same amount. He told his cellmate that the destruction of the theatre \"was a question of contracts\" and that he carried out the arson because he needed the money. He also named the people who had paid him. At this point the prosecutor barred the cellmate from giving further evidence on the grounds that the matter was under investigation, leaving yet another loose end to be tied up in the trial, which is set to continue until Easter, if not autumn. Although his photographs have been used as forensic evidence, Arici - like many of those familiar with the case - dismisses both the \"mafia connection\" and the arson theory as speculative rubbish. At a computer in his studio, he clicks through his reportage of the blaze. Although the rapid spread of the flames becomes more evident with each close-up, he claims the pictures do not prove anything. \"Some experts say the only way a fire could travel so fast from one side of the theatre to the other, with a wall in between, is if there were two, maybe three separate fires. Well, it may appear so, but with the inflammable material stored there, the dry, honeycombed wood throughout, and the draught from the open doors, the fast crossover makes complete sense.\" Arici believes that the prosecutor is misguided in charging the two electricians with arson, and is convinced that the fire was nothing more sinister than a tragic combination of circumstances. \"The danger involved in setting fire to a theatre, especially one with such a confusing layout as La Fenice, would put off anybody. I've known it for 20 years and was always getting lost. It was a rabbit warren. They couldn't have started a fire in that area and been sure of escaping in time through the labyrinth of staircases, corridors, steps, doors, turnings, dead ends. Being late with the renovation, they tried to speed things up a bit, were perhaps using something like a blowtorch, and some sparks fell somewhere. Or maybe they did want to do a little damage, an excuse to extend the deadline, and got scared when things went out of control. To destroy a whole theatre and risk your life just to avoid paying a fine of a few million lire would be unbelievable. The more important issue is that lack of security remains a fact, whether this was an accident or not.\" And there, Arici has put his finger on far more shameful aspects of the case. No one knows more about the scandalously lax administrative standards and wanton disregard for the theatre's security than the stage door-keeper and \"concierge\", Gilberto Paggiaro. To his dismay, Paggiaro, who has worked at La Fenice since 1984, has been charged with \"culpable negligence\", along with the theatre's former general manager, its chief administrative supremo, the former mayor Massimo Cacciari (in his capacity at the time as representing the building's owners, the city council) and five surveyors and engineers, who are accused of failing to implement adequate safety measures during the theatre's refurbishment. As far as Paggiaro is concerned, the administrative rot was all-pervasive and nothing new. \"There has always been a problem with staffing La Fenice,\" he says. \"For years I'd been telling the management that I'm often alone on duty. Although there are three other caretakers, for many reasons they may not be there, and one man cannot properly supervise the theatre's safety. Their answer was always, 'It's too expensive to hire more staff.'\" Between August 1995 and January 1996, Paggiaro was under added pressure, having to monitor the comings and goings of the 50 staff members who had continued working in the theatre's offices for the duration of the refurbishment, while also keeping an eye on a daily influx of another 50 or more strangers - builders on varying shifts from different firms and casual shift workers whom he didn't recognise, as well as tourists who would wander in to look around and take photographs. \"The smoke alarm, which was installed in front of my office, used to go off with fumes from building works, so they had unplugged it weeks earlier. But no one thought it important to have a fireman on duty through the night, or to arrange for a hose to be connected to a central water supply since the surrounding canals were empty, just in case something happened.\" Paggiaro's claims are backed up by recent evidence given by an engineer who was in charge of managing the site until the builders moved in. The engineer, who had tested the theatre's old firefighting equipment shortly before it was disconnected and found it in perfect working order, had at the time suggested that some empty cisterns, buried for years under the building but still watertight, could be used now to provide 200,000 litres of water in case of emergency. His proposal was not taken seriously, not even when, on January 12, a fire broke out following the overheating of metal on a piece of equipment that had been placed too close to a wooden beam. On that occasion, the fire had been put out quickly, because workmen were still on the site. Only a month previously, says Paggiaro, a surveyor from the Prefect's office began drawing up revised safety regulations. \"Even then, the administrators put off any decision about implementing those rules. They said it wasn't urgent, and that the various building firms should take responsibility for safety. The builders said it was the theatre's responsibility. Each one passed the buck to the other.\" On the night of January 29, Paggiaro began making his safety rounds at about 8.30pm when he smelled smoke.\"I thought it was outside, perhaps from one of the restaurants next door. I looked into the street but saw nothing. It was strong enough for me to put a handkerchief to my mouth, but I carried on with my rounds. All at once, I saw flames and lots of smoke reflected in a mirror on an upstairs landing outside the Salle Apollin\u00e9e.\" Running downstairs to his office, he phoned the Vigili del Fuoco, which told him that the incident had already been reported. By then, the smoke was getting thicker and sparks were flying. \"I waited a few minutes for the firemen, and when they didn't come I got frightened and went out into the square - and ran into Graziano Arici taking pictures of the blaze.\" What upsets him most, as an experienced veteran employee of the theatre, is the suggestion that he was negligent in reporting the blaze early enough because he was asleep, drunk or watching TV when it began.\"Had the smoke detector not been disconnected, I obviously would have known something was wrong and raised the alarm far earlier.\" The majority of Venetians regard the Fenice affair with weary resignation. Shock and sadness over the disaster, followed by a collective determination to triumph over adversity, has been superseded either by embarrassment or a near cynical indifference. Even the whodunnit element has lost its grip, as the trial drags into its fourth year, and all 10 defendants, apart from the two electricians, have moved on to other jobs. Besides, they now have a new focus for their anger: the five-year debacle over the rebuilding of La Fenice. Today, the site is little more than a vast, spectral ruin, desolate as a war zone, open to the sky, its facade and outer walls clad in scaffolding, plastic sheeting, and boarded up outside. Inside, large cranes, transported, like all materials and machinery in Venice, piecemeal by boat along the canals and assembled on site, stand idle in the swirling winter fog. Underfoot, the ground, mostly rubble, remains soggy after recent weeks of unusually severe \"aqua alta\" - the annual high tides that are steadily eating away at Venice's fragile and diseased substructure. Here a fragment of marble, there an isolated neo-classical column propped up by wooden posts, elsewhere a ragged section of dusty-pink fresco are poignant reminders of what was lost and how much has yet to be rebuilt. With few builders on the site and no work apparently in progress due to a new, acrimonious dispute over costs and scheduling between the German-Italian construction firm, Holzmann-Romagnoli, and the town council, the sense of doom is as crushing as an operatic tragedy. \u0095 Read the rest of this article here",

There's another once clever but nowadays played-out device which holds out the hope of some really juicy morsel of gossip, and then at the very last moment withholds it. To wit: \"I have just discovered the most extraordinary secret about Michael Portillo. It seems that he tells his friends... but alas, I seem to have run out of space.\" In my view, those who use this device after so much previous employment deserve not just to have leeches stuck to them, but to undergo ancient torments such as the one where... but alas, I seem to have run out of space. \u0095 Ian Mayes is away.",

But of course it is not us they are trying so hard to attract: it is the birds, the butterflies, the insects, and those legendary night-pollinating moths. If a flower garden gives me the impression that it is flowering there for my pleasure and benefit, it is engaged in a deception. And if I fall for that deception, I am like someone who, entering a crowded room, believes that all eyes are upon him, when in fact all eyes are upon the swarm of bees visible just over his shoulder. </p> <p>\"How beautiful are the retired flowers!\" wrote Keats in a famous passage; \"how they would lose their beauty were they to throng into the highway crying out, 'Admire me, I am a violet! Dote upon me, I am a primrose!' \" In fact that is exactly what the flowers, even the retired flowers, are saying to their pollinators. Or if not that, then they are saying something coarser. </p> <p>And their colours, which provoke in us such a profound and complex response, were once their exclusive property. No one saw such colours, unless it was in a flower, or a gemstone, or some extraordinary artifice such as purple-dyed cloth. Some flowers may have disturbed or repelled by their mysterious or obscene shapes, but none, surely, was thought ugly for its colour. Sad, perhaps. But never ugly. </p> <p>Today some makers of gardens are so browbeaten by colour snobbery that they settle for a garden in which all flowers are excluded, or they take nervous care to check which flowers, which colours, are okay. Gardening writers, in the hope of giving the weight of science to their reflections, talk about combinations of complementary colours, and sometimes even refer to the colour wheel. But this is uncandid taste masquerading as high theory. </p> <p>There is no point in asking, in the abstract, whether burnt orange will look well alongside vermilion. A garden is not a canvas, and even with a canvas the question has no answer. How large a patch of burnt orange, in relation to how large a patch of vermilion - and what else is going on within the proposed colour field? Is the gardener who thinks of placing a burnt orange flower beside a vermilion one taking into account the colour and relative importance of the leaves? Or is it assumed that all greens are somehow factored out by the retina? </p> <p>Gardening is quite unlike painting, but there are things one can learn from the painter nevertheless. John Gage, the great historian of colour theory, tells a story of Turner and Constable exhibiting their paintings side by side in 1832 in the crowded conditions of Somerset House. Painters in these exhibitions specialised in last-minute tricks to ensure that their works looked well. On this occasion Constable found \"the red robes of the dignitaries in his picture of the Opening of Waterloo Bridge (London, National Gallery) cast into obscurity by the wafer of red sealing wax which Turner applied to the water of his cool green sea piece next to it, Helvoetsluys, and later painted into the form of a buoy. 'He has been here,' said Constable when he saw it, 'and fired a gun.' \" </p> <p>Some small flowers possess this ability to \"fire a gun\": (no 1) Pheasant's Eye, the hardy annual Adonis aestivalis , is a flower with the force of a concentrated blood-red anemone - a small ranunculus, in other words.

People are sometimes under the illusion that the flowers they find ugly, or over-assertive, are the ones that have been genetically modified. In point of fact the flowers they find ugly are very often orange, like the incomparable (no 4) California Poppy, Eschscholzia californica . When I first invited visitors to my garden, they turned the corner and very loudly and flatly declared, \"I don't like that.\" Perhaps I had let it seed itself too promiscuously, but I have charted its favour in the last decade.

Timewatch (BBC2) made the shocking revelation last night that Sir Thomas More wasn't the nice, kind-to-small- animals-and-children figure he was made out to be in A Man for All Seasons. He wasn't decent or fair, or driven by anything other than ambition and fanaticism. And he probably didn't even give money to ye olde Comical Reliefe. </p> <p>A Man for All Seasons was, according to the historian who presented The King's Servant, \"a whitewash. Hollywood under the Tudors\". More, whose charm hid a steely ruthlessness, was actually a zealot whose hatred of heretics - that is, people who didn't believe what he did - led him to imprison, torture and burn them. He dexterously rose through the ranks at Henry VIII's court until Fat Henry's divorce from Catherine of Aragon and subsequent marriage to Anne Boleyn meant he could no longer do the King's wishes, conflicting as they did with his Catholic views. And Fat Henry had been so nice and reasonable up until then. Well, you could have blown me down with a hurricane. A nasty, conniving, rabidly toxic politician? Working in the court of Fat Henry? Shurely shome mishtake. </p> <p>Even once this statement of the completely obvious was out of the way the programme still failed to engage. This was entirely down to the decision to dramatise the events surrounding More's fall from grace. True, dramatisations of what (might have) happened are more interesting than cameras panning over old documents and castle walls but, in this case, only just. With everyone overacting for England, it was all too easy to imagine the actors getting a call from their agents: \"Listen, I got you a great job - Sir Thomas More. No, not in A Man for All Seasons. In a reconstruction in a BBC2 documentary. Hello? Hello?\" </p> <p>Timewatch's finest moment came in a t te-\u00e0-t te between More and Thomas Cromwell. \"How will you control the king when you hand him the earth?\" More asked Cromwell, who brought about the submission of the clergy to Henry. \"And if you can't control him, what will be the end for you?\" Is that a line from Invasion of the Giant Ants or what? The beanpole historian told us these events were pivotal in English history. So why did it sound like an insurance salesman talking about a boring policy document? Tripe. </p> <p>Now they've all hit 35 and survived the storm in last week's episode, the gang in Dawson's Creek (Channel 4) are taking time to evaluate what they want to do with their lives once they stop pretending they're schoolchildren. Bizarrely, none of them mentions going to Hollywood, perhaps to star in a movie about sex or drugs to shake off their squeaky-clean images. How strange. Of course, it would be hard to go to Hollywood when your head is so firmly stuck up your bottom that you ruminate endlessly in a postmodern style about how teen shows run into trouble when the stars get too old for high school and have to go to a nearby, heretofore unheard-of college or stay in a town where their brains and qualifications make continued residence unrealistic. God, how utterly uninteresting. </p> <p>Is it wrong to boycott Frasier (Channel 4) because Kelsey Grammer is a chum of George Bush? It's either that or stop buying Ricky Martin records. And seeing as not even deaf, stupid people buy Ricky Martin records, not watching Frasier is the only thing I can do to register my disapproval of Bush. Such a decision is all the harder because - at last - Daphne's cor blimey bruvver 'as naffed off, and it's fun counting the ways they are trying to hide her bump. Still, you can't win 'em all. As Al Gore recently found out.</p>",

He dexterously rose through the ranks at Henry VIII's court until Fat Henry's divorce from Catherine of Aragon and subsequent marriage to Anne Boleyn meant he could no longer do the King's wishes, conflicting as they did with his Catholic views. And Fat Henry had been so nice and reasonable up until then. Well, you could have blown me down with a hurricane. A nasty, conniving, rabidly toxic politician? Working in the court of Fat Henry? Shurely shome mishtake. Even once this statement of the completely obvious was out of the way the programme still failed to engage. This was entirely down to the decision to dramatise the events surrounding More's fall from grace. True, dramatisations of what (might have) happened are more interesting than cameras panning over old documents and castle walls but, in this case, only just. With everyone overacting for England, it was all too easy to imagine the actors getting a call from their agents: \"Listen, I got you a great job - Sir Thomas More. No, not in A Man for All Seasons. In a reconstruction in a BBC2 documentary. Hello? Hello?\" Timewatch's finest moment came in a t te-\u00e0-t te between More and Thomas Cromwell. \"How will you control the king when you hand him the earth?\" More asked Cromwell, who brought about the submission of the clergy to Henry. \"And if you can't control him, what will be the end for you?\" Is that a line from Invasion of the Giant Ants or what? The beanpole historian told us these events were pivotal in English history. So why did it sound like an insurance salesman talking about a boring policy document? Tripe. Now they've all hit 35 and survived the storm in last week's episode, the gang in Dawson's Creek (Channel 4) are taking time to evaluate what they want to do with their lives once they stop pretending they're schoolchildren. Bizarrely, none of them mentions going to Hollywood, perhaps to star in a movie about sex or drugs to shake off their squeaky-clean images. How strange. Of course, it would be hard to go to Hollywood when your head is so firmly stuck up your bottom that you ruminate endlessly in a postmodern style about how teen shows run into trouble when the stars get too old for high school and have to go to a nearby, heretofore unheard-of college or stay in a town where their brains and qualifications make continued residence unrealistic. God, how utterly uninteresting. Is it wrong to boycott Frasier (Channel 4) because Kelsey Grammer is a chum of George Bush? It's either that or stop buying Ricky Martin records. And seeing as not even deaf, stupid people buy Ricky Martin records, not watching Frasier is the only thing I can do to register my disapproval of Bush. Such a decision is all the harder because - at last - Daphne's cor blimey bruvver 'as naffed off, and it's fun counting the ways they are trying to hide her bump. Still, you can't win 'em all. As Al Gore recently found out.",

      "body": "<p>By common consent, the 1930s and 1940s were a golden age for British documentary. Under their fiery Scottish boss John Grierson at the General Post Office Film Unit, young directors like Harry Watt, Edgar Anstey and Basil Wright began to flourish. Such films as Song Of Ceylon (1935) and Night Mail (1936) hinted at how documentary could be at once playful, lyrical and provocative, educational and formally adventurous. The war provided young directors with perfect subject matter. The work done by the Crown Film Unit and the Ministry of Information, notably Humphrey Jennings's Fires Were Started, Pat Jackson's Western Approaches, and Harry Watt's Targets For Tonight had an urgency that peace-time films could not match. </p> <p>It was inevitable that British documentary's profile would fall once the war was over. \"Everything afterward seemed an anti-climax,\" acknowledges John Legard, an editor and producer who began his career at the Crown Film Unit in 1943. Many of the best-known film-makers now made the transition to feature films. Those who stayed behind fell out of the public gaze, and had to find new subject matter. They made films about housing, the coal industry and agriculture. One prodigious but unsung outfit, British Transport Films, produced hundreds of documentaries about every aspect of travel in post-war Britain. The best of their work is now being released on video by the British Film Institute in the series British Transport Classics. </p> <p>The glib assumption that only the most inveterate trainspotters could find any interest in movies about steam engines, trains caught in snowdrifts, electrification, timetables and branch lines doesn't hold quite true. With the British railway system currently in a state of crisis, these films have a special poignance. They present an extraordinarily rosy image of rail travel in post-war Britain. </p> <p>They show trains driving through snowdrifts to help farmers rescue their livestock or taking trippers to seaside towns. They portray stationmasters and railway workers in an idealised light that makes even Soviet documentaries about heroic workers seem understated. They reveal how local lines opened up remote areas of the UK to travellers and holiday-makers. One guesses that railways never did operate quite as smoothly as the documentaries suggest, but there is something oddly consoling in their evocation of an era when the transport system served the British public rather than simply inflicting pain on it. </p> <p>British Transport Films came into being in the summer of 1949, in the Pillars of Hercules, a pub in London's Soho. It was here that Grierson's old protege, Edgar Anstey, summoned young cameraman Ronald Craigen for a meeting. \"He told me that the British Transport Commission had decided to make up a film unit and he wanted me as the cameraman,\" Craigen, now 86, recalls. \"We were to deal with waterways, railways, buses - anything that was part of the nationalised travel system.\" </p> <p>The goal of the new film unit, Anstey declared, was \"to create an appetite for travel\". The documen taries were intended to open up Britain to all its inhabitants. \"In those days, a large percentage of the country didn't own a car - they went by train or bus,\" remembers Legard, who joined the unit in 1951. \"We worked on the basis that if you get people interested, they will travel,\" Craigen says. \"And if they travel, they'll probably go by British Rail or on the nationalised buses. We were showing them the things they could see. It was quiet promotion, not blatant advertising but subtle work. </p> <p>These are propaganda films for sure. Their upbeat optimism often begins to grate. The commentaries are written in sub-John Betjeman doggerel. (\"The guard is laconic/ His obsession with time is quite chronic,\" runs one typical rhyming couplet.) Some of the films hardly touch on travel at all, and instead show the joys awaiting trippers at the end of their journeys. My Heart Is Highland (1952) is mainly about heather, lochs and hillsides, but with several sycophantic asides about the glories of hydroelectric power and the good works of the Forestry Commission. The Land of Robert Burns (1956) is a none too convincing hymn of praise to rural Ayrshire. Some of the more specialist documentaries, for instance the mini-epic about the electrification of the London Midland Region Main Lines or the film extolling the blue pullman, are hard to watch with eyelids open. </p> <p>Anstey and his team spent months polishing each new film. In the process, such matters as overcrowding, the problems resulting from nationalisation and the consequences of the Beeching cuts are not even touched upon. We are offered a Trumpton-style vision of Britain in which all social tensions are miraculously rubbed out. </p> <p>The artistry that characterised the work of Basil Wright, Humphrey Jennings at al has also gone into these films. The British Transport Films team shared the same political drive as their predecessors. They were left-wing idealists, proseltyising on behalf of a travel system accessible to all. They refused to fraternise with the enemy. \"We were once shooting at Alnwick Castle with the Duke of Northumberland in a rather splendid banqueting hall,\" Legard recalls. \"The crew were invited to have a drink with the Duke, and they said certainly not, they were not going to drink with the aristocracy.\" </p> <p>Legard admits the unit was never critical of its main paymaster, British Rail. \"You could argue that that was a weakness. There were terrible problems in the railways at that time, but we were making films in the service of a particular industry and championing the craftsmen. That was fair enough.\" </p> <p>The documentaries were shot silently, with a commentary and a score conducted by Muir Mathieson (the maestro of British film music) added on. Anstey and his colleagues were able to conjure drama out of the most unprepossessing situations. The pivotal moment in Elizabethan Express, a record of a journey aboard a steam train from King's Cross to Edinburgh Waverley, comes somewhere near Newcastle, where signalling failure delays the train by four and a half minutes. Clawing those missing minutes back becomes a matter of life and death for all concerned. \"Nothing must stop her. That is official. Lateness causes pain,\" runs the commentary as extra coal is heaped into the engine and Macleod, the heroic driver, settles down to his task. </p> <p>Anstey was a milder personality than his old boss, Grierson. \"He was a fierce, rather volatile figure,\" Legard remembers. Anstey remained respectful toward his old boss, but Grierson was not always flattering about Anstey's efforts. When the unit made a film about the post office, 30 Million Letters, which featured a playful pastiche of Night Mail, the Scot let everyone know he was not impressed. \"It was shown at the Venice festival. Grierson, who was on the jury, didn't think much of it. I mentioned it and he said, 'Och, it's been doon better.'\" </p> <p> The films were seen by millions. They were shown in cinemas as supporting programmes, but there was also a team of travelling projectionists. \"The non-theatrical circuit was colossal at that stage,\" Legard recalls. He and his colleagues became experts on the railway by default. \"We didn't really have a passion for trains,\" says Craigen. \"The passion was for making films. That was our main driving force.\" As a cameraman, he was often perched on top of trains, or hanging out of them, or squatting down by the side of the track to get the best possible shot. He talks in rapturous terms of how handsome the old steam engines looked. \"The beautiful sun on glistening snow, the train coming up the incline, billowing white smoke...\" </p> <p>Legard believes that the films have aged remarkably well: \"Many of the feature films of that time seem terribly dated, but some of the modest little documentaries we were making about the railways seem as fresh as daisies.\" </p> <p>The unit closed in 1982 mainly, it seems, because British Rail could no longer afford it. By then, Anstey was retired, and the old-style Grierson-approach to documentary was out of favour. The idea of taking months to shoot and edit a 35mm film with an orchestral score about an engine caught in a snowdrift (as in Snow Drift at Bleath Gill) didn't make sense when a TV crew could cover it in an afternoon. Still, there are several organisations around today who would benefit from resurrecting a British Transport Film unit to extol their virtues.

      "body": "<p>Next time you find yourself getting pavement rage at all those clipboard-wielding do-gooders in netball bibs on the high street, spare a thought for Victorian gentlemen. Apparently, they couldn't walk down Oxford Street without being accosted by frisky prostitutes or leafleted about the pernicious evil of masturbation. I learned this, and much else besides, in Radio 4's Victoria Season, which began this week. Quite the giddiest moments came during that ordinarily well-behaved slot, the afternoon play. </p> <p>Victorian Marriage Beds, a three-part series about disastrous Victorian wedding nights, kicked off with an eye-wateringly frank look at George Eliot's sexual relationship with her second partner, John Cross, who was 21 years her junior. It began quite innocently, with Eliot teaching Cross the history of metaphysics and him teaching her the rules of lawn tennis.

      "bodyText": "Next time you find yourself getting pavement rage at all those clipboard-wielding do-gooders in netball bibs on the high street, spare a thought for Victorian gentlemen. Apparently, they couldn't walk down Oxford Street without being accosted by frisky prostitutes or leafleted about the pernicious evil of masturbation. I learned this, and much else besides, in Radio 4's Victoria Season, which began this week. Quite the giddiest moments came during that ordinarily well-behaved slot, the afternoon play. Victorian Marriage Beds, a three-part series about disastrous Victorian wedding nights, kicked off with an eye-wateringly frank look at George Eliot's sexual relationship with her second partner, John Cross, who was 21 years her junior. It began quite innocently, with Eliot teaching Cross the history of metaphysics and him teaching her the rules of lawn tennis. If only they had stuck to such simple pleasures. Six weeks into their marriage, Cross and Eliot had yet to consummate it. The more Eliot dragged him round Venice's art galleries, looking at paintings of nude folk, the more, well, hot and bothered young Cross became. Sensing a problem, Eliot tried a couple of cold-shower comments - \"Shall I read you some more Dante?

      "body": "<p>Ever since Lorenzo de Medici first sponsored Michelangelo, the commercialisation of art has been gathering pace. But what happens when museums - the gatekeepers and guardians of art - start behaving like corporations? </p> <p>The New York-based Guggenheim museum has announced a three-way collaboration with the Kunsthistorisches museum in Vienna and the Hermitage in St Petersburg. Under the new arrangement - which builds on a prior agreement between the Guggenheim and the Hermitage - the museums will exchange paintings and curating staff in an effort to boost what Nicholas Iljine, European representative of the Guggenheim Foundation, calls their collective \"marketing and picture power\". </p> <p>The response of the guardians of the American museum world is to cry \"McGuggenheim!\", and claim that Thomas Krens, the management-trained director of the New York Guggenheim, is rolling out the brand. The tie-up with the Hermitage and Kunsthistorisches are just part of a wider strategy for what looks increasingly like a bid by Krens for world domination. Following the critical success of Frank Gehry's titanium-clad Bilbao museum, Krens is already planning new Guggenheims in Las Vegas, Rio de Janeiro, Venice and St Petersburg, as well as a massive new \"son-of-Bilbao\" on the East River at Wall Street. </p> <p>But it is not so much Krens's franchise approach to the memory of Solomon Guggenheim (1861-1949) - the mining magnate whose endowment gave birth to the original Frank Lloyd Wright museum 63 years ago - that affronts his critics so much as his commercialisation of the space inside the present 88th Street ziggurat. Three years ago, for instance, Krens, 54 - who wears black and rides a BMW to work - controversially curated The Art of the Motorcycle, an ode to bike design that was sponsored by BMW. This month marks the end of another crowd-pleaser, Giorgio Armani, an exhibition of sketches and frocks sponsored by Time Warner fashion magazine In Style, and reportedly accompanied by a gift of $5m (\u00a37m) to the museum by the Italian designer. </p> <p>Both shows were wildly popular, attracting visitors who had never seen the Guggenheim's holdings of Kandinskys and Klees to the museum for the first time, but Philippe de Montebello, director of the rival Metropolitan Museum of Art complained: \"It's a betrayal of public trust,\" in an interview in Forbes magazine. \"A compromising sponsorship to clean up the bottom line,\" is how Maxwell Anderson, director of the Whitney Museum of American Art, described it. </p> <p>Krens retorts: \"Culture can be educational and entertaining. Our success is a function of our authenticity. We are not for sale.\" Well, there may have been only six BMWs in the motorcycle exhibit, but what was authentic about also putting a BMW on the cover of the catalogue? </p> <p>Krens's supporters on this side of the Atlantic have come to his defence. \"I personally wouldn't do an Armani exhibition,\" says the Royal Academy's Norman Rosenthal, who considers himself both a \"friend and admirer\" of Krens, \"but I might do a motorcyle exhibition. There have been shows about motor cars, why can't there be shows about motorcycles?\" </p> <p>In many ways Krens's courting of commerce echoes the row over Rosenthal's courting of Saatchi and the even more controversial decision by the Brooklyn Museum last year to allow Saatchi to curate his Sensation exhibition after the museum accepted a $168,000 donation from the advertising executive-turned-collector and $50,000 from Christie's, which auctions many of Saatchi's works. </p> <p>Rosenthal argues that such concerns are overblown. \"The art world is full of contradictions. You can never resolve them all. What you've got to do is judge every individual case and every event on its merits.\" </p> <p>He maintains that Krens's ambition is good for the Guggenheim and good for worldwide art audiences. Compared to the Met, the Guggenheim's endowment is relatively modest - just $37m, or the equivalent of one year's operating expenses (the Met's endowment by comparison funds it for 11 years). Unlike most British art institutions, it cannot rely on public funds to bail it out when gifts, contributions and attendances dry up. The only way it can survive is through growth, hence the new Guggenheims in New York and elsewhere and the partnership with the Hermitage. \"Krens's view is that the world is full of art, but huge parts of it are not on view. He's trying to make space for all of it,\" says Rosenthal. This interconnection between the market, growth and survival is perfectly encapsulated in Gehry's model for a new megamuseum in South Street, overlooking the East river. Nicholas Serota was able to fund Tate Modern with \u00a350m from the Millennium Commission and \u00a36m from the Arts Council's Lottery Fund, Krens will have to raise nearly all the money for his proposed new Manhattan museum privately. </p> <p> As presently envisaged, the new museum -a swirling wave of titanium and glass stretching four blocks along the piers at South Street which Gehry describes as \"two holey donuts on stilts\" - would have 200,000 square feet of permanent exhibition space, as well as a 40-storey office tower, arts and education centre, theatre and a massive park and outdoor sculpture garden. In an echo of Serota's explanation for the Tate needing Bankside, Krens argues that the new building will take the pressure off Wright's ziggurat, freeing up space at the Fifth Avenue building for more of the prewar permament collection, while allowing postwar and new experimental installations, like video, to migrate to the new building. Without that space, the Guggenheim may not be able to attract donations of important private art collections on which the museum's future survival depends. \"This space will allow the institution to grow into new areas and support the long-term viability of the Guggenheim,\" he says. All of which is a good argument for New York but not necessarily for the new Guggenheims Krens is also planning in Las Vegas and beyond. The new resort hotel-casino in Vegas - a joint venture between the Guggenheim and the Hermitage scheduled to open this spring - is expected to bring art to a whole new audience, the 35m or so punters who patronise the desert casinos each year. </p> <p>Gamblers and philistines, Krens's critics resort sniffily. The Guggenheim management board are simply after the money, the Met's de Montbello, claims sceptically. \"It's certainly not the same thing as if they were to send their collection to the St Louis art museum where they would get zero, but they would reach a very large public.\" </p> <p>The hotel museum in Las Vegas (which is rumoured to be considering a reproduction of the Sistine chapel on the roof) is only one of a series of joint ventures that Krens is pursuing in an alliance with the Hermitage that is aimed at forging a whole new paradigm, what Krens calls an \"international museum\". </p> <p>In return for the Guggenheim helping the Hermitage renovate the General Staff building in St Petersburg adjacent to its present state appartments in the Winter Palace, for instance, the Hermitage will make its unique collection of old masters and French impressionists available to the new Guggenheims in Las Vegas and New York, and vice versa. This treasure-sharing arrangement will also encompass Bilbao, the Deutsche Guggenheim Berlin and a second Venice Guggenheim. The tie-up with the Kunsthistorisches museum in Vienna - renowned for its collection of Brueghels and other European masters - converts this \"marriage of opposites\" into into a menage a trois. </p> <p>\"It worries me that too many adventures by museums who adopt a for-profit mentality may end up jeopardising the tax-exempt status for all of us,\" says Max Anderson of the Whitney. \"Institutional jealousy,\" Rosenthal responds. \"He's not a stupid man, he's a Dostoyevskian figure, a gambler much more than he is Mr Management.\" The Guggenheim used to be the 'poor relation'; now under Krens it attracts many of the sponsors rival museums would like to have for themselves. Moreover, says Rosenthal, Bilbao was \"an astonishing achievement\". If this is what Krens means by \"leveraging our expertise\" the more the better. </p> <p>Not everyone,however, is quite so enamoured by Krens's undoubted achievements. \"Krens is a dynamic character who likes to go his own way. You either love him or hate him,\" says one prominent British museum curator, who asked not to be named. \"His philosophy is that you rush around the world proposing 10 schemes in the hope that one of them works out. What you have to weigh up is whether it's of benefit or not.\" </p> <p>Krens was unavailable for comment, presumably too busy scouring the globe in search of new \"alliances\" and \"migratable cultural resources\". It is perhaps an indication of his iron management style that the Guggenheim failed to put up anyone else to speak in his place. </p> <p>Some find him intimidating - he is at least 6ft 6in and with a personality to match. When Hila Rebay, the art adviser to Solomon Guggenheim, commissioned Frank Lloyd Wright to design a new building in Manhattan to house Guggenheim's four-year-old Museum of Non-Objective Painting, she wrote, in 1943: \"I need a fighter, a lover of space, an agitator, a tester and a wise man.\" Krens would seem to fit at least the first three of Rebay's requirements. </p> <p>\"He's incredibly energetic,\" says a senior museum staffer. \"I've worked with a number of corporate high-flyers but this man travels more than anyone I've ever met, and he knows how to get things done.\" One of Krens's first acts as director was to restore Wright's rotunda and monitor building to its original splendour and add a new tower, thus extending the overall exhibition space at the Fifth Avenue building. Next came a new downtown space, the Guggenheim Museum Soho, followed, in 1997, by Berlin and Bilbao. </p> <p>The South Street building, however, is a far more daunting proposition. Bilbao was susbsidised by the Basque government, who even chipped in a $20m gift to the Guggenheim endowment. Although New York's mayor, Rudolph Guiliani green-lighted the Manhattan project and the city will provide the land and $67m towards the building, Krens will have to raise the rest of the capital himself. Fortunately, he has the backing of a number of wealthy trustees, including Peter Lewis, the billionaire chairman of the Guggenheim board, who made his fortune selling high-risk insurance and is apparently talking of donating as much $100m towards the project (Lewis is a big fan of Gehry's - the architect has not only built a house for Lewis in Cleveland but is also designing him a business school). </p> <p> Judging by the crowds flocking to view Gehry's model of the new museum, currently on display at the Fifth Avenue premises, the South Street building would be at least as big a draw as Bilbao. Management consultants McKinsey &amp; Co estimate it would create around 5,000 new jobs and attract 2.5-3.5m visitors a year. However, some critics remain singularly unimpressed - calling Gehry's design more Disney World than art world -while a proposal to build \"sky boxes\" to entice corporate sponsors appals those who believe museums should subscribe to more democratic principals. </p> <p>There is just one problem with this line of argument and that is, for all Krens's supposed commercial \"debasement\", his exhibitions are hugely popular. When Dennis Hopper launched Art of the Motorcyle in Bilbao, for instance. it attracted an astounding 1m visitors (the exhibit will open the new Las Vegas Guggenheim in the spring). The figures aren't in for the Armani exhibit yet, but judging by the crowds packing the ramps this month, it has done very well and should be a similar hit when it transfers to Bilbao in April. </p> <p>Indeed, Krens points out that worldwide attendance at the four Guggenheims is now 2.5m, compared to 350,000 in 1989, the year after he took over. And he predicts that once the Las Vegas museum is up and running, attendances could be closer to 6m, surpassing both the Met's 5m and the Museum of Modern Art's 2m. </p> <p>Whatever the views of his detractors, there's no getting away from the fact that - as Newsweek puts it -Krens's \"aggressive, global approach may be what high culture needs to survive in our world\".</p>",

When Dennis Hopper launched Art of the Motorcyle in Bilbao, for instance. it attracted an astounding 1m visitors (the exhibit will open the new Las Vegas Guggenheim in the spring). The figures aren't in for the Armani exhibit yet, but judging by the crowds packing the ramps this month, it has done very well and should be a similar hit when it transfers to Bilbao in April. Indeed, Krens points out that worldwide attendance at the four Guggenheims is now 2.5m, compared to 350,000 in 1989, the year after he took over. And he predicts that once the Las Vegas museum is up and running, attendances could be closer to 6m, surpassing both the Met's 5m and the Museum of Modern Art's 2m. Whatever the views of his detractors, there's no getting away from the fact that - as Newsweek puts it -Krens's \"aggressive, global approach may be what high culture needs to survive in our world\".",

      "body": "<p>Red is the colour of blood, the colour of danger and the colour of temptation. In Snow White, the heroine is tempted to bite into the red part of the apple and is poisoned. In Little Red Riding Hood, a girl puts on a red cloak and goes into the forest, where her visibility makes her fall prey to the wolf. Hans Christian Andersen took the symbolism to a new extreme of cruelty in The Red Shoes - an age-old folk tale given a modern reworking this week by the Kneehigh Theatre Company. In Andersen's deeply unpleasant version, the little orphan girl Karen is punished for her vanity in coveting red shoes and daring to wear them to church. </p> <p>Like the wicked queen in Snow White, who, in some versions of the story, is punished for her sexual jealousy of her stepdaughter by being forced to dance herself to death in red-hot shoes at the happy couple's wedding reception, Karen is condemned to dance in her shoes until \"she turns raw and red and her skin clings to her bones as if she were a skeleton\". It seems certain she would have danced herself to death but for the fact that her wild, abandoned steps lead her to the town executioner, who chops off her feet. </p> <p>The idea of uncontrolled, wild dancing as something dangerous stays with us: the club must be licensed for entertainment; the rave strictly policed. The idea of people enjoying themselves, whirling like banshees out of control is deeply unsettling to authority. Uncontrolled passion must be restrained. </p> <p>Yet in the not-so-distant past, hundreds of thousands of people took part in frenzied outdoor orgies and wild displays of dancing that lasted for weeks. People would dance themselves into a state of elation, tearing off their clothes, laughing, weeping and having sex with strangers. Some participants died of heat stroke and exhaustion, others just had a jolly good time, found release, and then returned to their old lives. A bit like weekend clubbers. </p> <p>From as early as the eighth century and as late as the 17th, these dance manias spread across Europe. In the late 13th century, several hundred people danced so furiously on a bridge over Germany's Maas river that it collapsed, killing most of the revellers. The survivors were treated in the nearby chapel of St Vitus, giving rise to the name St Vitus's dance for these manias and associated neurological conditions in which the patient's limbs twitch and jerk uncontrollably. In Italy, cases of tarantism - in which the victims believe they have been bitten by a tarantula and will only survive through incessant and frenzied dancing - have been reported well into the second half of the 20th century. </p> <p>Individual and mass hysteria is the commonest explanation for these outbreaks of dancing manias and, in most cases, it has been suggested women were most commonly affected. Dancing yourself to death seems to be a peculiarly female affliction - perhaps a desperate attempt at escape and release for women whose lives were strictly controlled by behavioural and social conventions. </p> <p>But in combining the sexual symbolism of the shoe, common in so much mythology and folk tale, with the potency of the colour red, the misogynistic Andersen created a new version of an old myth in which the anti-heroine Karen is offered no release, but merely punishment, mutilation and death. At the end of the story, this original scarlet woman hobbles to the church on crutches, where she repents, her heart breaks and her soul flies up to God. </p> <p>Quite how vindictive this tale is can be deduced from the fact that Andersen named his heroine after his half-sister, Karen, whom he loathed because she was the illegitimate offspring of a liaison between his mother and a married man. For the socially ambitious, upwardly mobile Andersen, Karen was a reminder of his humble beginnings and his mother's promiscuity. He punished her the only way he knew how: in print. </p> <p>But the punishments for women who dare to dance to their own tune have gone on being meted out. In Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger's 1948 film version of The Red Shoes, Karen becomes Vicky, a young ballerina singled out by ruthless, exacting ballet impresario Lermontov for stardom. Lermontov employs Julian, a composer, to create a ballet version of the Andersen story for Vicky, and ballerina and composer fall in love. Forced to choose between the demands of Lermontov and Julian, ballet and love, Vicky succumbs to the pressure and dances herself to death. With its ravishing, expressionistic use of colour and lush romanticism, The Red Shoes has rightly become a movie classic but, in daring to want both love and art, Vicky served as a gruesome lesson to millions of post-war British women, who, after the freedoms of the war and a taste of work outside the home, might have been tempted to imagine that, in peace time, they could have it all: marriage and career, love and creativity. </p> <p>Fifty years on, we still struggle to reconcile our desires with reality. The Red Shoes remains as potent, bitter and scary for women today because, like the stepsisters in Cinderella who mutilate themselves to make the shoe fit, or Karen and Vicky, whose feet are severed from their bodies, we all sacrifice bits of ourselves in a maddened attempt to conform and survive. And, like poor Karen, when we realise what we have lost, we often replace the loss with pain, addiction and obsession. The Red Shoes is not about the temptation of red, but the stain it leaves behind long after the whirligig dance is over. </p> <p>\u0095 Kneehigh Theatre Company's production of The Red Shoes is at BAC, London SW11, from Tuesday.

No, he was told: you can't have Greenwich, since that belongs to the Duke of Edinburgh, and you can't have Croydon because it's a London borough and I keep those for dukes, earls and marquises. How typical of this shockingly London-centred country to give away the title of Liverpool while declining to dish out mere Croydon. Fond as I am of Croydon (yes, really), it is hardly in the same class as the city of maritime history, the Liver building and G\u00e9rard Houllier. </p> <p>Yes, G\u00e9rard Houllier, who, now that his team has reached the Worthington Cup final, has moved to the very top of the coveted Smallweed Rankings, just ahead of PY Gerbeau. For those who have never heard of the Smallweed rankings (which is everybody but Smallweed, since I only invented them five minutes ago), this celebrated system rates in order of recent success all those bosses of big British institutions who are imports from abroad and have utterly charming accents. At present it stands as follows: 1. Houllier of Liverpool. 2. Gerbeau of the Dome. 3. Wenger of Arsenal (not doing so well now, are they?). 4-24. Various other people. 25. Luc Vandevelde of M&amp;S. Watch out for further adjustments. </p> <p> <strong>Which brings </strong> me to another exciting innovation: Smallweed's Resort of the Year. To whet your appetites for a sun-kissed summer, I hope to suggest over the next few months fun places to spend your holidays. A winner will be announced in due course. Here we go: </p> <p>Smallweed's Resorts of the Year, number 1: Uttoxeter, Staffs. Uttoxeter has a pretty marketplace (or so its website suggests) and a memorial to Dr Johnson in the form of a kiosk which is now a very small shop. Dr Johnson once refused to show up as instructed at his father's stall in Uttoxeter market. Many years later he came back to the town and stood in the rain, bare-headed, as a form of penance. </p> <p>What's more, Uttoxeter (or so its web site suggests) is where the civil war effectively ended, when Royalist forces expected to do bloody battle with the Parliamentarian army of General Lambert surrendered instead. Uttoxeter has a racecourse and is not all that far away from Alton Towers. There is also a railway station. Uttoxeter's so-called rivals, I suggest, have a great deal to beat in coming months. </p> <p> A question that has troubled me for some time reared up again at the Wigmore Hall on Wednesday at a concert given by the sublime American soprano Barbara Bonney. The audience, as you'd expect, was ecstatic. But how can one express adulation in today's concert halls? The old practice of shouting \"Bravo!\" sounds so heyday-of-empire. Instead, my fellow-adulators mostly made do with cries of \"hoo\" and \"hoy\" which convey no particular message but just make a noise. </p> <p>Maybe the concert hall will one day become like the football ground, with audiences shouting: \"Two, four, six, eight, who do we appreciate? D-I-M-I-T-R-I-S-I-T-K-O-V-E-T-S-K-Y - Dimitri Sitkovetsky!\"; or even, \"One John Eliot Gardiner and the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment - there' s only one John Eliot_ etc, etc.\" But I hope not. The chanting of names even as brief as Bonney's would delay her luscious encores. The accompanist, by the way, was Malcolm Martineau, who deserves to have his name chanted too. People sometimes forget that bit. </p> <p> <strong>In pieces</strong> about what Hartlepool thinks about Peter Mandelson, I noticed that interviewees were sometimes described as Hartlepudlians. I thought this was a joky derivation from the Liverpudlians of Liverpool, but the borough council tells me that it is correct. I then phoned Blackpool to ask if its people were known as Blackpudlians, but that appears to be frowned on. \"We are known as 'sand grown 'uns',\" my informant proudly confessed. \"Blackpudlians\", I suppose, too easily summons up black puddings. These matters are very sensitive. </p> <p>\"My heart leaps up when I behold a rainbow in the sky,\" wrote Lord Rees-Mogg in the Times on Monday. \"That is nothing to the way it leaps up to see Bill Clinton leaving the White House.\" The first thought, of course, is Wordsworth's; the second is merely Smog's. But I know how he feels. My heart leapt up when I read this week that Sean Connery had been cast as Socrates in a bumper new movie. I predict this film will have huge successes with audiences, right from the opening scene (\"The name is Socrates... James Socrates\") to the climax when the apparently dead philosopher springs back to life, revealing that before he swallowed the hemlock, he had gulped down an antidote supplied by his secret service boss. The rest of the cast has not yet been revealed, but I understand it is likely to be as follows: Aristotle, Roger Moore; Plato, Robert de Niro; Alcibiades, Vinny Jones; Persephone, a nubile maiden with whom Socrates is conducting a secret affair, Catherine Zeta-Jones; Xanthippe, Judith Kilshaw. The hemlock, cold tea. </p> <p> <strong>And finally</strong>, Smallweed's poem of the week, dedicated this week to Lord Rees-Mogg: </p> <p>My heart leaps up when I behold </p> <p>A dustbin in the sky. </p> <p>They have them emptied, I am told </p> <p>By dustmen who can fly. </p> <p>- Keats. </p> <p><strong> A pedant writes: </strong> I am a keen student of the works of John Keats, and do not recognise the stanza you have quoted. </p> <p> <strong>Smallweed engagingly snarls: </strong> I said nothing about John Keats. These words are the work of a man called Rog Keats, who works in my local butcher's.</p>",

At present it stands as follows: 1. Houllier of Liverpool. 2. Gerbeau of the Dome. 3. Wenger of Arsenal (not doing so well now, are they?). 4-24. Various other people. 25. Luc Vandevelde of M&amp;S. Watch out for further adjustments. Which brings me to another exciting innovation: Smallweed's Resort of the Year. To whet your appetites for a sun-kissed summer, I hope to suggest over the next few months fun places to spend your holidays. A winner will be announced in due course. Here we go: Smallweed's Resorts of the Year, number 1: Uttoxeter, Staffs. Uttoxeter has a pretty marketplace (or so its website suggests) and a memorial to Dr Johnson in the form of a kiosk which is now a very small shop. Dr Johnson once refused to show up as instructed at his father's stall in Uttoxeter market. Many years later he came back to the town and stood in the rain, bare-headed, as a form of penance. What's more, Uttoxeter (or so its web site suggests) is where the civil war effectively ended, when Royalist forces expected to do bloody battle with the Parliamentarian army of General Lambert surrendered instead. Uttoxeter has a racecourse and is not all that far away from Alton Towers. There is also a railway station. Uttoxeter's so-called rivals, I suggest, have a great deal to beat in coming months. A question that has troubled me for some time reared up again at the Wigmore Hall on Wednesday at a concert given by the sublime American soprano Barbara Bonney. The audience, as you'd expect, was ecstatic. But how can one express adulation in today's concert halls? The old practice of shouting \"Bravo!\" sounds so heyday-of-empire. Instead, my fellow-adulators mostly made do with cries of \"hoo\" and \"hoy\" which convey no particular message but just make a noise. Maybe the concert hall will one day become like the football ground, with audiences shouting: \"Two, four, six, eight, who do we appreciate? D-I-M-I-T-R-I-S-I-T-K-O-V-E-T-S-K-Y - Dimitri Sitkovetsky!\"; or even, \"One John Eliot Gardiner and the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment - there' s only one John Eliot_ etc, etc.\" But I hope not. The chanting of names even as brief as Bonney's would delay her luscious encores. The accompanist, by the way, was Malcolm Martineau, who deserves to have his name chanted too. People sometimes forget that bit. In pieces about what Hartlepool thinks about Peter Mandelson, I noticed that interviewees were sometimes described as Hartlepudlians. I thought this was a joky derivation from the Liverpudlians of Liverpool, but the borough council tells me that it is correct. I then phoned Blackpool to ask if its people were known as Blackpudlians, but that appears to be frowned on. \"We are known as 'sand grown 'uns',\" my informant proudly confessed. \"Blackpudlians\", I suppose, too easily summons up black puddings. These matters are very sensitive. \"My heart leaps up when I behold a rainbow in the sky,\" wrote Lord Rees-Mogg in the Times on Monday. \"That is nothing to the way it leaps up to see Bill Clinton leaving the White House.\" The first thought, of course, is Wordsworth's; the second is merely Smog's. But I know how he feels. My heart leapt up when I read this week that Sean Connery had been cast as Socrates in a bumper new movie. I predict this film will have huge successes with audiences, right from the opening scene (\"The name is Socrates... James Socrates\") to the climax when the apparently dead philosopher springs back to life, revealing that before he swallowed the hemlock, he had gulped down an antidote supplied by his secret service boss. The rest of the cast has not yet been revealed, but I understand it is likely to be as follows: Aristotle, Roger Moore; Plato, Robert de Niro; Alcibiades, Vinny Jones; Persephone, a nubile maiden with whom Socrates is conducting a secret affair, Catherine Zeta-Jones; Xanthippe, Judith Kilshaw. The hemlock, cold tea. And finally, Smallweed's poem of the week, dedicated this week to Lord Rees-Mogg: My heart leaps up when I behold A dustbin in the sky. They have them emptied, I am told By dustmen who can fly. - Keats. A pedant writes: I am a keen student of the works of John Keats, and do not recognise the stanza you have quoted. Smallweed engagingly snarls: I said nothing about John Keats. These words are the work of a man called Rog Keats, who works in my local butcher's.",

The basis for the initial collection is the records, scores, books and amateur pamphlets gathered over a lifetime by the former Labour MEP Janey Buchan and her late husband Norman. For most of their careers, the Buchans were at the forefront of the British protest movement - from CND through trade-union picket lines to the anti-apartheid struggle. But they were also folk musicians and hoarders. \"I never collected anything in my life,\" says Buchan, aged 74. \"But over the years, this house has become full of records and books about political songs.

In the 10th century, plainsong was the monks' subtle way of demonstrating.

And in Tudor England, monks changed the last lines of Latin standards to fashion songs of protest. \"This was a church living in dangerous times,\" says early music specialist Warwick Edwards. \"When you look at these things on the page, they do not look very political.

But there are more delicate messages at play in popular culture. A standard refrain of America's white racists to the more progressive whites was the question: \"How would you like it if they married your sister?\" It's a comment addressed in an apparently apolitical torch song.

Throughout the Vietnam protests of the 60s, Bob Dylan, Joan Baez and many more gave the protest generation a focus for their condemnation. But when, in the UK, the attacks became universal and without focus, there was a backlash. \"For about six months after the Sex Pistols TV interview with Bill Grundy in December 1976, a lot of councils and some of the commercial chains refused to put on or cancelled punk gigs,\" says Martin Cloonan, an author on censorship in pop. \"Some punk was overtly political, but the politics was often ambiguous. The most political punks were anti-establishment, but what that led to were political movements like Rock Against Racism,\" he says. </p> <p>\"In the UK, punk's nihilistic politics was followed by targeted political songs such as Tom Robinson's 1979 standard Glad to Be Gay and, in the 80s, by Billy Bragg and his mates in the Labour-supporting Red Wedge, and the Special AKA's Free Nelson Mandela\". Political song continued to flourish locally. The largest part of the collection was gifted by Buchan, much of it covering Scottish protest and the women's movement: tunes from the Faslane peace camp's Ding Dong Dollar to the Lament of the Working Class Hero's Wife. One of the gems is a reworking of a Scottish music hall song, written during the last general election: \" I know a hawk from a handsaw /I know a boot from a shoe. /At a distance of 100 paces, /a rabbit I'll tell fae a hare /I can tell Stork fae butter, /know murmur fae mutter /But I cannae tell Major fae Blair. \" </p> <p>Although the centre has, in its infancy, a personal tone, development officer, Caroline Cochrane is attempting to broaden its range. \"We are seeking donations to widen the scope and already we know the centre's going to be huge,\" she says. \"When Janey has contacted various libraries across the world, it is clear that, although there is no other dedicated centre, political song is everywhere and, when we launch our website in the summer, we'll begin offering links to all the places that it can be found.\" </p> <p>And already political song is filtering through from the most oppressive regimes.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Shadow Of The Vampire is a one-joke movie, but the joke is a very good one. The premise is this: in 1921, the great German director FW Murnau set out to film Bram Stoker's Dracula, one of the most popular novels ever. Denied permission by Stoker's estate, Murnau concocted his own version of the Romanian Count Dracula, his being a skeletal figure with extremely long fingernails who lived in the mountains of Czechoslovakia. The character was named Nosferatu, and the black-and-white silent film bearing his name is widely thought to be one of the greatest horror movies of all time: frightening where Bela Lugosi's Dracula was merely camp, philosophical where films like Frankenstein were merely maudlin.</p> <p>Murnau, as portrayed by the peerlessly strange John Malkovich, is clearly a bit touched in the head. A typical product of the Weimar Republic, Murnau is a denizen of that brooding Teutonic demi-monde where everyone is androgynous, everyone is addicted to at least one dangerous drug, and everyone seems to be waiting for either the Gestapo or Liza Minnelli to turn up. Mercifully, Shadow spares us any ruminations on the role of decadent, disenfranchised vampires in the rise of the Third Reich; it proceeds from the reassuring assumption that all Germans of that era were weird.</p> <p>To make his vampire movie extra-special, Murnau has arranged for the lead role to be played by an ageing thespian named Max Schreck, an unbelievably hideous man. No one has ever heard of him. Enter Willem Dafoe, another reliably idiosyncratic actor of Malkovichian pedigree, whose distinctive teeth make him the perfect choice for the part. Though Schreck is identified as an alumnus of Stanislavsky's actor's school, it soon becomes apparent that the actor is a real-life vampire. Well, it does to the audience.</p> <p>Tragically, the other characters in this movie-about-the-making-of-a-movie are less quick on the uptake, and even after a number of mysterious disappearances, several vicious attacks on the cast and crew, and one unnerving incident where Dafoe plucks a bat out of the air and eats it raw, they still do not put all the pieces together. Oh, they definitely have him pegged as an oddball and a bit of a ham, but it does not seem to occur to them that he may be the spawn of Satan. Their failure to process this information results in many more deaths, massive budget over-runs, and lots of drug abuse. But in the end, they get the footage they came for.</p> <p>Because he is a vampire, with unconventional dining habits and unusual sleep patterns, Schreck creates many problems on the set - quite apart from his tendency to rip the lungs out of passing gofers and assistant producers. Indeed, after his \"find\" has feasted upon the original cameraman, Murnau is forced to shut down the production and go back to Berlin to obtain a replacement (Carey Elwes).

      "bodyText": "Shadow Of The Vampire is a one-joke movie, but the joke is a very good one. The premise is this: in 1921, the great German director FW Murnau set out to film Bram Stoker's Dracula, one of the most popular novels ever. Denied permission by Stoker's estate, Murnau concocted his own version of the Romanian Count Dracula, his being a skeletal figure with extremely long fingernails who lived in the mountains of Czechoslovakia. The character was named Nosferatu, and the black-and-white silent film bearing his name is widely thought to be one of the greatest horror movies of all time: frightening where Bela Lugosi's Dracula was merely camp, philosophical where films like Frankenstein were merely maudlin. Murnau, as portrayed by the peerlessly strange John Malkovich, is clearly a bit touched in the head. A typical product of the Weimar Republic, Murnau is a denizen of that brooding Teutonic demi-monde where everyone is androgynous, everyone is addicted to at least one dangerous drug, and everyone seems to be waiting for either the Gestapo or Liza Minnelli to turn up. Mercifully, Shadow spares us any ruminations on the role of decadent, disenfranchised vampires in the rise of the Third Reich; it proceeds from the reassuring assumption that all Germans of that era were weird. To make his vampire movie extra-special, Murnau has arranged for the lead role to be played by an ageing thespian named Max Schreck, an unbelievably hideous man. No one has ever heard of him. Enter Willem Dafoe, another reliably idiosyncratic actor of Malkovichian pedigree, whose distinctive teeth make him the perfect choice for the part. Though Schreck is identified as an alumnus of Stanislavsky's actor's school, it soon becomes apparent that the actor is a real-life vampire. Well, it does to the audience. Tragically, the other characters in this movie-about-the-making-of-a-movie are less quick on the uptake, and even after a number of mysterious disappearances, several vicious attacks on the cast and crew, and one unnerving incident where Dafoe plucks a bat out of the air and eats it raw, they still do not put all the pieces together. Oh, they definitely have him pegged as an oddball and a bit of a ham, but it does not seem to occur to them that he may be the spawn of Satan. Their failure to process this information results in many more deaths, massive budget over-runs, and lots of drug abuse. But in the end, they get the footage they came for. Because he is a vampire, with unconventional dining habits and unusual sleep patterns, Schreck creates many problems on the set - quite apart from his tendency to rip the lungs out of passing gofers and assistant producers. Indeed, after his \"find\" has feasted upon the original cameraman, Murnau is forced to shut down the production and go back to Berlin to obtain a replacement (Carey Elwes). But, in due course, the film is finally shot, and lasting fame for all involved parties is assured. Shadow of the Vampire is partially a half-hearted meditation on the search for immortality and partially a coy meditation on the ordinary hardships encountered in making a film. While it is true that Schreck's depredations massively reduce the cast (one producer, two cameramen, one actress, one script girl, countless hangers-on), Murnau seems content to work around these problems because the actor delivers such a realistic performance, and because he usually manages to get everything in one take. The film seems to be saying that making a movie with a bloodthirsty vampire isn't that much harder than making a movie with Kevin Costner. In the past century, the movie industry has made many valiant attempts to satirise itself (Sullivan's Travels, Day for Night, Contempt, Scream III), but Shadow Of The Vampire may be the cleverest effort yet.

Ministers wanted the cash to be targeted at children rather than just used as a support for marriage despite objections from church groups and opposition parties. But the switch to a means-tested tax relief for people with children will mean that couples need to fill in an Inland Revenue form. Confusion over who qualifies for the credit under the new rules has discouraged many people from making a claim. </p> <p>Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown said the credit would benefit 5m families, but only 2.8m claim forms sent out last summer by the Inland Revenue to potential claimants have so far been returned. </p> <p>The Treasury points out that of the 5m families who stand to benefit from the new, \"family tax cut\", a million are self-employed and will therefore be claiming the credit in arrears. So they don't count, at least not yet. </p> <p>Nevertheless, there are still at least 1.3m eligible families out there who, if they get their acts together and their claim forms in by the end of February, could start receiving the tax credit, worth up to \u00a310 a week, in their pay packets from April. If they leave it any later to claim they won't benefit until later and will have to wait for a rebate. </p> <p>Martin Barnes, director of the charity Child Poverty Action Group, says: \"I think the main reasons many people have not yet made a claim for the new tax credit is that so far there has been a lack of publicity about it and a lot of people simply aren't aware that it could potentially give them a sizeable reduction in their tax bill. </p> <p>\"The new tax credit is a significant boost to parents and carers with children. But to get it, you must put in a claim. So anyone who thinks they may be eligible should claim now if they haven't already done so.\" </p> <p>The Treasury says a remedy, in the form of a \u00a34.8m advertising campaign, is due to start in February. </p> <p>The Children's Tax Credit is designed to help families who have at least one child under 16 living with them. It is available to married or unmarried couples and to single parents. To claim you must have at least one child - your own child, a stepchild, adopted child or a child you look after at your own expense - who is living with you for at least part of the tax year and is under 16 at the start of the tax year on April 6. </p> <p>There is only one credit for each family and if you are living with a partner, you can only have one credit between you, even if you have more than one child under 16 living with you. </p> <p>Unlike the personal tax allowance, the Children's Tax Credit is not an amount of income you can receive without paying tax. Instead it reduces your tax bill by up to a set amount and this is reflected in your tax code. </p> <p>New tax codes currently being sent out for the new tax year have an \"H\" beside the number if you are receiving the basic personal allowance plus full Children's Tax Credit. Eligible claimants should note that if their new tax code has an \"L\" beside the number, they have not yet made a claim. </p> <p>You may be confused as to how much the new credit is worth. In last year's Budget it was announced that the credit would be worth up to \u00a3442 a year (\u00a38.50 a week) off the tax you have to pay. </p> <p>However, in last November's pre-Budget report, the Chancellor said it was his intention to boost the credit and make it worth up to \u00a310 a week or \u00a3520 a year. So, though \u00a3442 remains the official figure that you'll see used in all Inland Revenue booklets and illustrations, it is safe to assume that when the credit takes effect in April it will be worth up to \u00a3520 a year. </p> <p>The credit is paid at the full rate unless the person claiming it is a higher rate tax payer, that is, if their individual income is likely to be more than \u00a332,785 (based on 2000/2002 tax bands). </p> <p>The credit is reduced at the rate of \u00a31 for every \u00a315 of income taxed at the higher rate. This means that you are unlikely to receive any credit if your income is above around \u00a341,000 (\u00a342,000 at the \u00a3520 per year rate). The credit is expressed as an allowance of \u00a34,420 given at the rate of 10% (\u00a35,200 at 10% expected). </p> <p> If you are a higher rate taxpayer, you may see the reduction of the credit expressed as \u00a32 of the allowance withdrawn for every \u00a33 of income at the higher rate band. </p> <p>If neither partner in a couple pays higher rate tax, then either of them can have the whole credit or they can elect to share the credit equally between them. Both partners must agree if the partner with the lower income is to have all the credit allocated to him or her. If the partner who receives the credit does not pay enough tax to use all of it, he or she will be able to transfer the unused credit to the other partner after the end of the tax year. </p> <p>If either, or both, partners pay higher rate tax, the partner with the larger income must claim the credit. One anomaly has arisen in the system as a direct result of independent taxation which means that a family with two working partners can get more tax credit than a couple where only one partner works. </p> <p>For example, a couple where both partners each earn \u00a330,000, just below the higher rate tax threshold, would be entitled to receive full Children's Tax Credit even though their joint income is \u00a360,000. </p> <p>In a household where only one partner works and earns just over the \u00a332,785 higher rate tax threshold would have the credit gradually withdrawn and if he or she earned over \u00a341,000 (over \u00a342,000 when the \u00a3520 rate comes in), they would get none at all. </p> <p>\u0095 Children's Tax Credit claim forms and explanatory booklets are available from local tax offices, from <a href=\"http://www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk\">Inland Revenue</a> and from the the Children's Tax Credit Helpline on 0845 300 1036. </p> <p>The Child Poverty Action Group has published a factsheet on the Children's Tax Credit.

Louise earns \u00a336,010 and Jeremy earns \u00a325,000.

But analysts said growth still appeared to be slowing and, with inflation below target, the monetary policy committee would probably cut rates from 6% next month. </p> <p>Gerard Lyons, global head of treasury research at Standard Chartered Bank, said: \"The Bank of England will cut interest rates probably in February by 0.25%. But [GDP] does not imply the economy is about to go into recession as there are many strengths in the economy.\" </p> <p>This month's vote on the MPC was the closest for some time, with four out of nine members pressing for a reduction in the cost of borrowing. </p> <p>Since then, underlying inflation has fallen further below the government's 2.5% target to 2%, and employment shrank for the first time in more than seven years. </p> <p>Some members of the MPC still remain cautious about the inflationary implications of the continued strength of consumer spending and a pick-up in wage growth at the start of the new year. For last year as a whole, growth was 3%, in line with the chancellor's forecast in November's pre-Budget report. </p> <p>But the final quarter figures mean that growth has now slowed to an annualised rate of just 1.3%, compared to the long term average of 2.25%-2.5%. </p> <p>ONS officials said manufacturing output grew slightly in the fourth quarter but energy supply and agriculture declined. Construction output was static compared with Q3, when there was a quarterly decline of 1.4%. </p> <p>The slowdown in the services sector was mainly due to weaker output growth in business services and finance and, to a lesser extent, in transport.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Economic growth fell to a two-year low in the final quarter of last year, reinforcing expectations in the City that the Bank of England will cut interest rates next month to boost demand. Output of goods and services expanded by 0.3% between October and December, reducing the annual growth rate from 3% to 2.4% in the third quarter, according to figures published by the office for national statistics. The quarterly growth rate was the weakest since the end of 1998, when the Bank's monetary policy committee slashed rates to ward off a global slump. City economists said yesterday's figures exaggerated the weakness of the economy at the end of last year - which was mainly due, they say, to a sharp drop in erratic energy output linked to unseasonably warm weather and maintenance work on North Sea oil platforms. It was also likely that growth of services output, which slowed from 0.9% to 0.7%, had been artificially depressed by chaos on the railways. But analysts said growth still appeared to be slowing and, with inflation below target, the monetary policy committee would probably cut rates from 6% next month. Gerard Lyons, global head of treasury research at Standard Chartered Bank, said: \"The Bank of England will cut interest rates probably in February by 0.25%. But [GDP] does not imply the economy is about to go into recession as there are many strengths in the economy.\" This month's vote on the MPC was the closest for some time, with four out of nine members pressing for a reduction in the cost of borrowing. Since then, underlying inflation has fallen further below the government's 2.5% target to 2%, and employment shrank for the first time in more than seven years. Some members of the MPC still remain cautious about the inflationary implications of the continued strength of consumer spending and a pick-up in wage growth at the start of the new year. For last year as a whole, growth was 3%, in line with the chancellor's forecast in November's pre-Budget report. But the final quarter figures mean that growth has now slowed to an annualised rate of just 1.3%, compared to the long term average of 2.25%-2.5%. ONS officials said manufacturing output grew slightly in the fourth quarter but energy supply and agriculture declined. Construction output was static compared with Q3, when there was a quarterly decline of 1.4%. The slowdown in the services sector was mainly due to weaker output growth in business services and finance and, to a lesser extent, in transport.",

Last year's euphoric spenders will be in for a nasty shock when they assess their true financial position over the coming weeks,\" says Professor Peter Spencer, the Club's economic adviser. He says that people will have to be more prudent with their spending. </p> <p>There are various factors to blame: capital gains from shares and unit trusts are set to fall, demutualisation windfalls have dried up, house price increases have levelled off and indirect taxation continues to increase while bonuses are falling. Pensions and retirement savings have been diminished by lower stock market returns. The Bank of England will also be relying on the man in the street to practice Chancellor Gordon Brown's favourite virtue, prudence, before it cuts interest rates. </p> <p>\"With employers suffering a profit squeeze and the governement raising taxes, people may be forced to continue to dig into their savings or, more likely, push credit to its limits,\" says Mr Spencer. </p> <p>But spending will be a hard habit to break. Although many retailers, including Marks &amp; Spencer, are blaming slow sales over Christmas for their poor financial performance, figures released by the Credit Card Research Group this week show spending on plastic jumped by nearly a quarter on the previous year: a record \u00a318bn, of which \u00a39.5bn was on debit cards. The biggest outlays were on food, drink and travel. Most people left their shopping until late and took full advantage of the sales. </p> <p>But while credit card spending continues to grow, the percentage of cardhold ers paying interest on their account (ie, who do not pay off their full balance at the end of each month) fell last year from 78% in 1999 to 74%. \"This is a sign that spending is under control for the vast majority, even though spending on credit cards is up,\" says John Murray, director of the CCRG. </p> <p>Debt-managment firms which promise to cut people's repayments will come under the scrutiny of the Office of Fair Trading this year. The investigation will pay particular attention to charges as evidence mounts of misleading advertising and unfair contracts. Most firms take around 15% plus VAT on each monthly payment, plus an upfront fee. The UK's biggest debt manager is Baines &amp; Ernst, with \u00a31bn of debt on its books. </p> <p>Direct Debit has launched its annual promotional campaign to persuade us to pay our bills in this way. It says customers can save up to \u00a3135 a year if they switch payment of 10 household bills, such as council tax and utility bills, to direct debit. Discounts offered for DD payment include a 10% reduction in bills at the end of each year from London Elec tricity and a \u00a310.50 annual discount from Northern Electric. Retailers such as Marks &amp; Spencer and Ikea offer preferential annual percentage rates (APRs) to customers using DD: the standard Ikea store card rate of 29% APR is cut to 26.8%. Norwich Union Healthcare and Bupa both offer DD customers a discount of 5%. </p> <p>Around 75% of people now pay their household bills by DD, with the average paying six bills a year through the scheme. Increasingly, DDs can be set up by the paperless method, that is, over the phone or internet.</p>",

Pensions and retirement savings have been diminished by lower stock market returns. The Bank of England will also be relying on the man in the street to practice Chancellor Gordon Brown's favourite virtue, prudence, before it cuts interest rates. \"With employers suffering a profit squeeze and the governement raising taxes, people may be forced to continue to dig into their savings or, more likely, push credit to its limits,\" says Mr Spencer. But spending will be a hard habit to break. Although many retailers, including Marks &amp; Spencer, are blaming slow sales over Christmas for their poor financial performance, figures released by the Credit Card Research Group this week show spending on plastic jumped by nearly a quarter on the previous year: a record \u00a318bn, of which \u00a39.5bn was on debit cards. The biggest outlays were on food, drink and travel. Most people left their shopping until late and took full advantage of the sales. But while credit card spending continues to grow, the percentage of cardhold ers paying interest on their account (ie, who do not pay off their full balance at the end of each month) fell last year from 78% in 1999 to 74%. \"This is a sign that spending is under control for the vast majority, even though spending on credit cards is up,\" says John Murray, director of the CCRG. Debt-managment firms which promise to cut people's repayments will come under the scrutiny of the Office of Fair Trading this year. The investigation will pay particular attention to charges as evidence mounts of misleading advertising and unfair contracts. Most firms take around 15% plus VAT on each monthly payment, plus an upfront fee. The UK's biggest debt manager is Baines &amp; Ernst, with \u00a31bn of debt on its books. Direct Debit has launched its annual promotional campaign to persuade us to pay our bills in this way. It says customers can save up to \u00a3135 a year if they switch payment of 10 household bills, such as council tax and utility bills, to direct debit. Discounts offered for DD payment include a 10% reduction in bills at the end of each year from London Elec tricity and a \u00a310.50 annual discount from Northern Electric. Retailers such as Marks &amp; Spencer and Ikea offer preferential annual percentage rates (APRs) to customers using DD: the standard Ikea store card rate of 29% APR is cut to 26.8%. Norwich Union Healthcare and Bupa both offer DD customers a discount of 5%. Around 75% of people now pay their household bills by DD, with the average paying six bills a year through the scheme. Increasingly, DDs can be set up by the paperless method, that is, over the phone or internet.",

Earlier this month Liberal Democrat MP Simon Hughes said the government must speed up efforts to prevent the shortfall in policemen becoming wider. </p> <p>\"Officers coming up to retirement should be encouraged to stay on for up to an extra five years,\" he said in a letter to the Home Secretary Jack Straw. \"Good police officers who have retired in recent years should be encouraged to return for up to five years.\" </p> <p>To help private and public sector employers, the Inland Revenue is examining the strict rules that prevent people who take early retirement carrying on working for the same employer. Many private sector employers want to keep on older workers but find the Revenue's rules get in the way. And if this doesn't work, Gordon Brown's proposal for an army of 1m volunteers is supposed to persuade the rest that some work is more fulfilling than pruning roses. The government reckons 2m people over 50 live on pensions after retirement at a cost to the Exchequer of \u00a316bn in benefit payments and lost tax. </p> <p>But the likelihood of a huge grey army rushing to take stressful jobs in the public sector is extremely unlikely, according to pensions experts and pensioner groups. The lure of a highly regulated and stressful job like teaching, policing or nursing is severely limited, especially among people who have probably baled out to get away from the stress and regulation they experienced. </p> <p>\"It is not the answer to call back people who have already put in 30 to 35 years' service,\" says a spokesman for the National Pensioners Convention. \"It has been tried in nursing and has proved unsuccessful. People who have retired are not falling over themselves to go back to long hours and stress.\" </p> <p>The Employers Forum on Age, an employer-led anti-ageism campaign group backed by Help the Aged, agrees that front-line staff are unlikely to flock back to their old jobs if they have taken early retirement. A spokesman said it wanted the government to think more imaginatively. </p> <p>The Police Federation, which says the service has lost 2,500 officers since 1997, says the issue is so complex it is waiting for more details before making any comment. But it reckons police officers have experienced a 33% increase in workload since the present government took office and many leave the service to get away from it. Whether they will return without radical changes to the service is a moot point. </p> <p>NUT, the teachers' union, believes there is only a slim chance of persuading teachers to return after they retire. \"The last government changed the rules and passed the cost of pension enhancements to local authorities. That happened five years ago and early retirements stopped. So after a period when lots of teachers took early retirement there haven't been many,\" says a spokeswoman. </p> <p>The generation that ministers would like to encourage back might have to work 53 hours in a primary school and 51 in a secondary school, according to government statistics, for a maximum \u00a324,000. \"Many retired teachers miss the children, but not the hassle,\" she adds. Yet ministers will come under further pressure if strike ballots this week over teacher shortages come out in favour. </p> <p>To support employers' attempts to keep key staff, the government plans to scrap rules that prevent workers from taking part of their pension and some income from their employer. The proposal has been championed by the Employers Forum on Age, which last year attacked the Revenue for failing to produce a new scheme. It said employers had seen many staff take early retirement who wanted to work part-time but were prevented by Revenue rules which stipulate workers must change to another type of job or allow \"sufficient\" time to elapse before returning to the same employer. Nothing stopped them defecting to a rival employer down the road, so that's what they did. </p> <p>\"The Revenue has taken people to court and taken away their pension benefits when this has become a disputed matter, but there has never been a definition of \"sufficient\" time. Now an employee of Tesco who wants to work part-time must quit Tesco to get their full pension rights and go to Sainsbury's to get the extra income.\" </p> <p>The Inland Revenue says it shared the view that people should get more flexibility. But a spokeswoman added that changes to social security laws and complex tax practices needed to be thrashed out. Talks are continuing with the National Association of Pension Funds, which represents the pension funds of major employers, she said, \"but I'm afraid we can't say anything on timing\". </p> <p>Some experts are more upbeat. Cary Cooper, professor of organisational psychology at the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology, says: \"You are seeing organisations buying back retired staff between 50 and 55 years old. Some companies have found they are too lean or can't recruit. Others might feel they don't have enough wise heads around. </p> <p>\"I'm sure there are many managers in the private sector who have a university degree who will dedicate themselves to teaching, even if not many former teachers want to return after they have been burned out.\" </p> <p>Peter Thompson, a pensions expert at William M Mercer, says Inland Revenue changes to pension arrangements are part of the solution but \"getting people who have retired back into work is going to be a very difficult task. It is going to be much more about changing people's expectations.\" </p> <p>He believes that dramatic rises in life expectancy will continue. Government figures show that a male who currently retires at 65 will on average live to be 85. Worries about further rises in life expectancy have spurred ministers to add a little coercion to their list of incentives. </p> <p>A report out last year called Winning the Generation Game, produced by the prime minister's performance and innovation unit, recommended that new company and personal pension contracts increase the retirement age from 50 to 55. It is unclear what will happen to existing contracts, but changes may be phased in as they were when the retirement age for women was increased from 60 to 65.

Mr Issing and Mr Welteke also played down speculation that they would follow the lead of the US Federal Reserve and cut interest rates sharply, arguing that Europe was set to enjoy healthy growth this year. Mr Welteke said he was confident that Germany would grow by 2.75% this year, with consumer spending boosted by income tax cuts and gradually falling unemployment. \"Upside inflation risks have clearly lessened of late. We are seeing an appreciation of the euro, we are seeing the oil price falling. The economy is running somewhat more moderately, thus the price risks have lessened. \"But this does not yet signal that we now have to go in a different direction with monetary policy.\" Mr Issing said euro zone inflation was likely to come down, and that the euro's exchange rate was on course for long term gains. \"Markets are confident we will succeed in keeping inflation below the 2% benchmark we have identified as being compatible with medium term price stability.\"",

      "body": "<p>When thoughts turn to moving, the first question homeowners ask themselves is: \"How much is my house worth?\" Usually, sellers depend on estate agents to give them the most accurate answer. But will estate agents tell you the truth about the appeal of your rotten window frames, stone cladding and pebble-dashed feature wall? Or will they play to your vanity and whisper outlandish sums in a bid to secure your business? </p> <p>A seller in Cheshire found herself questioning estate agents' ability to carry out valuations when marketing her mother's flat at the end of 1999. Julie Brown (not her real name) asked three local estate agents to value the flat, located on the outskirts of a village in a highly desirable corner of Cheshire. Ms Brown knew the flat, packed with original features and in an attractive building, would sell and expected the agents to come up with similar prices. She was stunned when the valuations arrived. </p> <p>The agents wanted to begin marketing the property at \u00a395,000, \u00a3225,000 and \u00a3325,000 respectively. Ms Brown was particularly surprised because the lowest price was suggested by the \"poshest\" agent - one she had expected to overvalue the property. The agent who valued the flat at \u00a3225,000 came across as complacent. </p> <p>In the end she plumped for the agent who valued that flat at \u00a3325,000. \"I felt they were enthusiastic, appreciated the flat and they sent a man and a woman to assess it, something that appealed to me.\" The firm marketed the flat at an asking price of \u00a3295,000 and Ms Brown waited. \"It sat on the market for a while before we decided to come down in price. An offer came in at \u00a3240,000 and after assuring us at the outset that it would sell at over \u00a3300,000 they were falling over themselves to tell us to accept the \u00a3240,000 offer.\" </p> <p>The family was at the point of taking their business to another agent when they received an offer of \u00a3250,000 that was accepted. The transaction had taken seven months from initial marketing to completion. Ms Brown says it is disturbing that the flat sold for \u00a3150,000 more than the lowest valuation. She points out that sellers who fail to get several valuations or who are vulnerable could fall prey to incompetent or sharkish agents. In her case she believes the fact that the agent was new to the area may be partly to blame, adding: \"The agent who gave us the sky-high valuation was equally dodgy and the flat sat on their books for months.\" </p> <p>How much a home is worth is one aspect of marketing a home that sellers and agents can come to blows over, says estate agent ombudsman Stephen Carr-Smith. Members of the main estate agency trade bodies are expected to abide by a code of practice that includes never deliberately misrepresenting the value of property in order to gain an instruction. </p> <p>According to Mr Carr-Smith problems occur when estate agents don't explain to clients the rationale behind their valuations. He says: \"The key thing for estate agents is to manage a clients' expectations. To do this they should explain how the sale is progressing and make a record of why they are taking the action they are.\" </p> <p>When asked, estate agents will hint that valuation is an art form, a mysterious process only to be undertaken by those experienced and selling homes. Certainly experience is key, says Richard Gayner, head of country houses department at FPD Savills. When valuing properties, bricks and mortar is only one consideration, he says. \"If you asked me to draw a picture and write a specification of a house worth \u00a31 million and another that is worth \u00a32 million, you would be surprised how similar they are. In that bracket the dominant factor is the setting.\" </p> <p>Agents have to have their finger on the pulse of local demand, says Mr Gayner. When it comes to the top end of the market Georgian properties are still popular with the buying public. \"Although if you have two homes that are essentially the same one may be decorated well, another may be decorated expensively but dreadfully and the simpler one may sell for more,\" he adds. </p> <p>The problem for agents, says Jeremy Leaf, housing spokesman for the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, is that sellers only hear what they want to hear. \"Sometimes it can turn into an auction where the agent who says he or she will get the highest price for the property, gets the business.\" </p> <p>He says the first two to three weeks of marketing a home are key. Once a property has sat on the market for a while it is less appealing. </p> <p> Sellers should find an agent used to marketing properties similar to theirs and ask them to show why their home will fetch the price the agent is suggesting. Buyers should ask for evidence of recent sales of similar properties. </p> <p>In a busy market, Mr Leaf adds, nearly anyone can sell a house. Good agents come to the fore when the market is quiet. Stephen Carr-Smith says sellers should do their homework. Most buying and selling members of the public do not have as much knowledge as they should do about a transaction that is likely to be the most costly they make. Mr Leaf advises sellers to take a long hard look at their home and be realistic about its advantages and deficiencies. \"Even in a block of identical flats there will always be a difference in price,\" he adds. </p> <p>One flat may be in better condition or have a slightly different layout. In a pleasant street of three-bedroom homes the one with the loft conversion will sell for more but won't be worth as much as a four-bedroom home in the street, he explains. For sellers interested in undertaking their own research before going to agents, use property websites to get a snapshot of the property market. </p> <p>\u0095 By typing in their postcode visitors to <a href=\"http://www.upmystreet.com\">Up my street</a> can find the selling price of similar houses in their area.</p>",

According to Mr Carr-Smith problems occur when estate agents don't explain to clients the rationale behind their valuations. He says: \"The key thing for estate agents is to manage a clients' expectations. To do this they should explain how the sale is progressing and make a record of why they are taking the action they are.\" When asked, estate agents will hint that valuation is an art form, a mysterious process only to be undertaken by those experienced and selling homes. Certainly experience is key, says Richard Gayner, head of country houses department at FPD Savills. When valuing properties, bricks and mortar is only one consideration, he says. \"If you asked me to draw a picture and write a specification of a house worth \u00a31 million and another that is worth \u00a32 million, you would be surprised how similar they are. In that bracket the dominant factor is the setting.\" Agents have to have their finger on the pulse of local demand, says Mr Gayner. When it comes to the top end of the market Georgian properties are still popular with the buying public. \"Although if you have two homes that are essentially the same one may be decorated well, another may be decorated expensively but dreadfully and the simpler one may sell for more,\" he adds. The problem for agents, says Jeremy Leaf, housing spokesman for the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, is that sellers only hear what they want to hear. \"Sometimes it can turn into an auction where the agent who says he or she will get the highest price for the property, gets the business.\" He says the first two to three weeks of marketing a home are key. Once a property has sat on the market for a while it is less appealing. Sellers should find an agent used to marketing properties similar to theirs and ask them to show why their home will fetch the price the agent is suggesting. Buyers should ask for evidence of recent sales of similar properties. In a busy market, Mr Leaf adds, nearly anyone can sell a house. Good agents come to the fore when the market is quiet. Stephen Carr-Smith says sellers should do their homework. Most buying and selling members of the public do not have as much knowledge as they should do about a transaction that is likely to be the most costly they make. Mr Leaf advises sellers to take a long hard look at their home and be realistic about its advantages and deficiencies. \"Even in a block of identical flats there will always be a difference in price,\" he adds. One flat may be in better condition or have a slightly different layout. In a pleasant street of three-bedroom homes the one with the loft conversion will sell for more but won't be worth as much as a four-bedroom home in the street, he explains. For sellers interested in undertaking their own research before going to agents, use property websites to get a snapshot of the property market. \u0095 By typing in their postcode visitors to Up my street can find the selling price of similar houses in their area.",

      "body": "<p>This week Norwich Union became the latest insurer to give the all-clear to its endowment policies, promising to make up potential shortfalls. But are these pledges a guarantee of future security or little more than a PR ploy? </p> <p>Norwich Union has 500,000 policyholders whose mortgage endowments have fallen off track, but this week it pledged to top up final bonuses if they don't grow sufficiently to pay off the mortgage. The big winners are the 50,000 NU policyholders who last year were sent a \"red\" warning letter that their policy was at serious risk of failing to pay off a home loan. A further 450,000 of NU's 700,000 policyholders were sent an \"amber\" letter warning of a possible shortfall. All policyholders will now receive \"green\" letters telling them of the shortfall promise. </p> <p>But the promise does not come without strings, and NU was at pains this week to point out that its pledge was precisely that - not a guarantee. NU's promise is identical to that offered by parent company CGNU to policyholders who bought endowments under the Commercial Union, General Accident and Provident Mutual brands. Standard Life, the biggest single endowment provider, also has a similar pledge. </p> <p>Underlying their promises is a big catch - the funds have to earn an average of 6% a year after tax for the rest of the life of the policy. Only then will they \"guarantee\" to top up any endowment that still fails to pay off the mortgage on maturity. </p> <p>Norwich Union is confident that it will achieve 6% a year; after all, its 25-year endowments that are maturing this year have earned an average return of 12.1% a year. </p> <p>However, the pledge comes at an inauspicious time for investments; last year NU saw no investment growth at all on its with-profits fund after a gain of 17% in 1999. The major risk to endowment holders will be if the UK stock market goes into a long-term bear market of the type that has left shares in Tokyo stagnating for a decade. </p> <p>Most investment analysts believe such a scenario is highly unlikely in the UK. But the history books do show long periods of time in Britain where investment returns have averaged below 6%, and suggest that the 12% returns of the more recent past may turn out to be an inflation-era phenomenon only. </p> <p>According to Barclays, which every year analyses returns going back a century, real (post-inflation) investment returns have been below 6% in several decades during the 20th century, including the 30s, 40s, 60s and 70s compared with 10%-plus real returns during the 50s, 80s and 90s. </p> <p>There are a couple of other caveats regarding the NU pledge; the small print of the agreement says that top-up payments will only be made where premiums have been maintained throughout the policy term. It also does not apply to endowments that have been bought through the \"second-hand\" or traded market. </p> <p>Despite the caveats, the pledge puts CGNU and Standard Life's three million endowment holders in a better position than the remaining nine million at rival insurers. Why don't they follow suit and attach a shortfall pledge to their policies? </p> <p>CGNU and Standard Life say it is because only they can afford to do so, as they are protected by a large \"free assets\" cushion which could finance any shortfall payouts. They are at the opposite end of the scale to Equitable Life, which had few free assets to fall back on when its guarantees turned out to be very costly. </p> <p>Legal &amp; General, the next biggest endowment provider with 1m policies and Scottish Amicable, another very big player with 800,000 policies, dispute such a view. </p> <p>Hugh McKie of Scottish Amicable says: \"These companies have not put aside real reserves to cover the cost of the guarantee. You have to ask to what extent the pledges have any value if there is no reserving. The fact is that we have a good financial strength record, but we feel it is important to protect all classes of policyholders, not just one.\" </p> <p>Legal &amp; General also questions the quality of its rivals pledges. A spokesman said: \"What they are doing is giving promises, not guarantees. Endowments were not designed to contain guarantees and offering them could prejudice other customers' interests. It would be inappropriate to offer absolute guarantees.\" </p> <p>However, there is one company which is offering an absolute guarantee. Liverpool Victoria is giving a no-strings guarantee to all its endowment policyholders, backed by one of the highest free asset cushions in the insurance industry. Unfortunately, there are only a few beneficiaries; Liverpool Victoria has just 7,500 endowment policies, a mere drop in the ocean of the 12m policies in total and 3-4m that are believed to be at risk of not paying off mortgages. </p> <p> <strong>Payouts pain across board</strong></p> <p>Despite its pledge to protect endowment holders from mortgage shortfalls, Norwich Union joined other insurers this week in chopping payouts on these controversial policies. </p> <p>It knocked 3.9% off the amount a 25-year policy will pay this year, cutting the maturity value to \u00a386,028 from \u00a389,518. Endowments sold under the CGU label (Commercial Union and General Accident), the parent company of Norwich Union, were cut even more deeply, falling by nearly 10% to \u00a3105,291 from \u00a3116,839. </p> <p>NU defended the cuts as part of a strategy to bring bonuses on policies in line with low inflation and lower investment returns. It said that despite getting a return of zero on its investments last year, it has added a 4.75% regular bonus to ongoing endowment policies and 6.25% to pension policies. </p> <p>The payout figures above also reveal the big disparities between different insurers' endowment policies. Someone who paid \u00a350 per month over the last 25 years at Scottish Provident will this year pick up \u00a379,893, 31% less than the \u00a3115,305 payout at Scottish Life. </p> <p>Scottish Life has bucked the trend by increasing pay outs, partly because of its lower exposure to equity markets and bigger holdings in lower-risk gilts and bonds. But David Carrington at endowment market maker PolicyPlus says: \"Perhaps these payouts are a sweetener to policy holders prior to the vote on the proposed Royal London takeover.\" </p> <p>However, few endowments enjoy the payouts listed above. Around 30% are cancelled in the first three years, sometimes leaving policyholders with less cash than they paid in. </p> <p><strong>Endowment returns</strong></p> <p><strong>Companies</strong> 2000 | 2001 | % rise/fall </p> <p><strong>CGU</strong> \u00a3116,839 | \u00a3105,291 | -9.9% </p> <p><strong>Friends Provident</strong> \u00a3102,341 | \u00a393,144 | -9.0% </p> <p><strong>Norwich Union</strong> \u00a389,518 | \u00a386,028 | -3.9% </p> <p><strong>Scottish Life</strong> \u00a3101,899 | \u00a3115,305 | +13.2% </p> <p><strong>Scottish Provident</strong> \u00a385,120 | \u00a379,893 | -6.1% </p> <p>\u0095 Figures based on \u00a350 per month endowment over 25 years.</p>",

Unfortunately, there are only a few beneficiaries; Liverpool Victoria has just 7,500 endowment policies, a mere drop in the ocean of the 12m policies in total and 3-4m that are believed to be at risk of not paying off mortgages. Payouts pain across board Despite its pledge to protect endowment holders from mortgage shortfalls, Norwich Union joined other insurers this week in chopping payouts on these controversial policies. It knocked 3.9% off the amount a 25-year policy will pay this year, cutting the maturity value to \u00a386,028 from \u00a389,518. Endowments sold under the CGU label (Commercial Union and General Accident), the parent company of Norwich Union, were cut even more deeply, falling by nearly 10% to \u00a3105,291 from \u00a3116,839. NU defended the cuts as part of a strategy to bring bonuses on policies in line with low inflation and lower investment returns. It said that despite getting a return of zero on its investments last year, it has added a 4.75% regular bonus to ongoing endowment policies and 6.25% to pension policies. The payout figures above also reveal the big disparities between different insurers' endowment policies. Someone who paid \u00a350 per month over the last 25 years at Scottish Provident will this year pick up \u00a379,893, 31% less than the \u00a3115,305 payout at Scottish Life. Scottish Life has bucked the trend by increasing pay outs, partly because of its lower exposure to equity markets and bigger holdings in lower-risk gilts and bonds. But David Carrington at endowment market maker PolicyPlus says: \"Perhaps these payouts are a sweetener to policy holders prior to the vote on the proposed Royal London takeover.\" However, few endowments enjoy the payouts listed above. Around 30% are cancelled in the first three years, sometimes leaving policyholders with less cash than they paid in.

      "body": "<p>UK money watchdog the Financial Services Authority has barked at millions of endowment mortgage holders, warning them that the billions invested in their policies may not grow fast enough to pay off their home loans. </p> <p>But around a million other savers are to receive no such warnings, despite their financial futures depending on the same funds that have sometimes reduced homeowners to fear and despair. They are the holders of some of the most impenetrable investments on sale to the public - with-profits bonds. </p> <p>The FSA says that the original investment return figures used by endowment compa nies to sell with-profits policies are no longer valid in the current investment and inflation environment. It now regards reviewing with-profits business as a \"key project\". </p> <p>The bonds are lump-sum investments which offer annual gains while maintaining the initial capital. They have been on sale for more than a decade but their popularity has soared over the past five years as returns on bank and building society accounts fell with interest rates. </p> <p>Typical high-rate savings accounts yield around 6% before tax, compared to the bonds, which promise 7.5% tax-free to basic rate taxpayers and give the impression that your capital is safe. </p> <p>But these claims may not al ways be as watertight as they seem. (see opposite) The buyers of the bonds are mainly retired people or those approaching retirement. They are pouring around \u00a315bn a year into them- often attracted by first-year rates that depend more on financial engineering than investment returns. </p> <p>Now Barnstaple-based independent financial adviser Phillip Milton has broken ranks with a whistle-blowing booklet With Profits Bonds - Have You Been Myth-sold? which takes the lid off the steamy but very profitable world of the bonds. </p> <p>And next month a working party at the Faculty and Institute of Actuaries - the insurance professionals whose decisions govern returns on with-profits investments - will warn of the dangers investors face if they place too much reliance on returns promised in marketing literature following an actuarial paper last June which told companies not to hype figures artificially. </p> <p>But individual actuaries admit that it will need more than a warning to prevent financial advisers from puffing the plus points and deleting, as far as legally possible, the drawbacks. Commission on these products is very high - the Prudential has, in the past, offered some IFAs up to 7% on its top-selling Prudence Bond. Others include Eagle Star and Scottish Widows, also paying advisers up to 7% of what you pay in. Britannic and Sun Life pay a maximum 6.75%, and many others are at levels up to 6%. </p> <p>Sums invested in these bonds are large, typically \u00a325,000, therefore earning advisers up to \u00a31,750. These commissions are twice the level paid to advisers when the recommend a unit trust. And while some advisers discount part or even all of this commission, many insurers are now paying annual \"renewal\" commission whose cost has, ultimately, to come from investors. Those working for banks and insurers directly do not generally rebate. </p> <p><strong> T</strong> he suspicion remains that the bonds are pushed by advisers simply because the pay more commission than unit trusts. Yet the advisers' own professional body, the Chartered Insurance Institute, says: \"There should not be incentives that might create a bias towards plans where higher initial commission is paid to advisers.\" </p> <p> But potential difficulties go beyond high commission. \"These bonds have been gaining in popularity just when the bonus rates on which they depend have been dropping and the volatility of the funds has been increasing. These are supposed to be safe investments where the ups and downs are smoothed out but they are becoming increasingly risky as they become more reliant on equities to produce returns,\" Mr Milton says. </p> <p>With-profits bond money is managed in a very similar way to endowment mortgages and with-profits pension funds. But returns from these funds are falling. This month, insurance companies are declaring annual bonuses and, according to figures from second-hand policy dealer Beale Dobie, of the ones to declare annual, or reversionary, bonuses so far, three have fallen, four are unchanged and one very small player has risen. </p> <p>\"The money going into with-profits bonds ends up in the same pots as used by endowment policies to fund mortgages like the ones now suffering awful performance projections and fears of mis-selling,\" says Mr Milton. </p> <p>\"People don't realise that mutual companies pay regulatory fines and compensation for mis-selling out of with-profits funds. Other companies may even try subsidising loss-making stakeholder pensions from with-profits funds,\" he adds. </p> <p>We asked leading providers whether they offered high initial rates and how their rates had moved. </p> <p> <strong> Friend s Provident </strong> has a first year guarantee ranging from 5% on \u00a33,000 to 8.5% on \u00a3100,000. It justifies not alerting customers to the potential of falling rates because the plans do not have a target, unlike endowments. </p> <p> <strong> Norwich Union </strong> had a 25% market share last year. It says it complies with PIA guidelines on projection rates used and supports the Faculty and Institute of Actuaries on the promotion or marketing of headline bonus rates. NU does not declare high first year bonus rates and will not be doing so in the future. Since 1997 rates have fallen from 7.25% to 5.75%. </p> <p> <strong> Legal &amp; General </strong> has a confusing variety of products but says each year's plan is managed separately. It is replacing penalties for withdrawal in certain circumstances by managing a combination of lower annual growth rates plus higher terminal bonuses. </p> <p> <strong> Liverpool Victoria </strong> has around \u00a34.5bn in its bonds which offer a guaranteed 7.5% over the first two years by \"creating additional units.\" </p> <p> <strong> Royal &amp; Sun Alliance </strong> Annual bonuses have fallen from 7% in 1996 to 5% in 2000. It says: \"Our aim is to be fair to all policyholders by offering appropriate bonus rates, rather than trying to attract business by offering inflated rates at the outset.\" </p> <p> <strong> Standard Life </strong> has only been selling bonds since last August. Its bonus rate is 4.5%. There are no special deals. </p> <p> <strong> Scottish Friendly </strong> guarantees 6% in the first year but it will not market using \"an artificially high rate only to cut it dramatically in subsequent years\". Bonus rates have fallen from 7% to 6% since 1998. </p> <p> <strong> Prudential, Scottish Widows </strong> and <strong> Scottish Mutual</strong> were unable to reply. </p> <p><strong>Truth that lies behind the fanciful claims</strong></p> <p>With profits bonds have been one of the most successful investment products of the past decade - seeming to square the circle of safety combined with high returns. </p> <p>But they are far harder to fathom than unit or investment trusts. And that lets the insurers try to weasel their way into potential buyers' affections with big print claims that could be too good to be true. Here we examine assertions and reality. </p> <p> <strong> \"Your money is safe - your capital can never fall. \"</strong> </p> <p> True, but only up to a point. Many bonds take up to 5% upfront to cover charges including commission. But despite the reputation with-profits funds have of never falling back, the bond companies have the market value adjustment or 'MVA' in reserve. They all say this is rarely used but many wanting their money back during the 1998 Asian crisis suffered an Equitable Life style deduction of around 10%. Bonds often offer MVA-free encashments on the fifth or ten anniversary and always on death. Most say they never (or hardly ever) apply the adjustment. But what happens if shares melt down as they did in Japan where the Nikkei index is little more than a third of its 1989 value? </p> <p> <strong> \"The returns on with-profits bonds are totally free of basic rate tax and capital gains tax.\"</strong> </p> <p> Technically true but otherwise to be taken with a pinch of salt. Insurance funds are hit by corporation tax which is the equivalent of basic tax and capital gains tax. Non and lower rate taxpayers lose out while most basic rate payers do so as well as they cannot use their capital gains tax annual exemption - currently \u00a37,200. This contrasts strongly with Isas. The only possible winners from the tax treatment are higher rate taxpayers and those caught in the age allowance trap. </p> <p> <strong> \"You can have tax-free withdrawals.\"</strong> </p> <p> This is true up to 5% of the original sum paid in. But as the fund has already paid tax, further payments would would add up to double deductions. </p> <p> <strong> \"Bonds invest in a wide portfolio to provide a consistent return by smoothing out the ups and downs of the stock market\" </strong></p> <p> That's what they should do. But to produce the rates investors demand (and sellers need to justify commissions), insurers have to use higher proportions of volatile shares. The effect is that annual growth rates are variable, not smooth. And if markets fall with a bump, the annual bonus will be very low, the terminal bonus practically non existent while exits will be barred by the MVA. </p> <p> <strong> \"You get an allocation of 103% of your original investment.\" </strong></p> <p> Sounds great - more money from the outset but this depends on what you regard as your original investment. Savers with \u00a310,000 see it as \u00a310,000. Insurers take off 5% upfront and call it \u00a39,500 of which 103% is only \u00a39,885. </p> <p> <strong> \"We rebate all the commission\"</strong> </p> <p> Ask what happens to any annual renewal payments - advisers cannot live on air. </p> <p> <strong> \"No annual management charges\"</strong> </p> <p> True as far as it goes.

      "bodyText": "UK money watchdog the Financial Services Authority has barked at millions of endowment mortgage holders, warning them that the billions invested in their policies may not grow fast enough to pay off their home loans. But around a million other savers are to receive no such warnings, despite their financial futures depending on the same funds that have sometimes reduced homeowners to fear and despair. They are the holders of some of the most impenetrable investments on sale to the public - with-profits bonds. The FSA says that the original investment return figures used by endowment compa nies to sell with-profits policies are no longer valid in the current investment and inflation environment. It now regards reviewing with-profits business as a \"key project\". The bonds are lump-sum investments which offer annual gains while maintaining the initial capital. They have been on sale for more than a decade but their popularity has soared over the past five years as returns on bank and building society accounts fell with interest rates. Typical high-rate savings accounts yield around 6% before tax, compared to the bonds, which promise 7.5% tax-free to basic rate taxpayers and give the impression that your capital is safe. But these claims may not al ways be as watertight as they seem. (see opposite) The buyers of the bonds are mainly retired people or those approaching retirement. They are pouring around \u00a315bn a year into them- often attracted by first-year rates that depend more on financial engineering than investment returns. Now Barnstaple-based independent financial adviser Phillip Milton has broken ranks with a whistle-blowing booklet With Profits Bonds - Have You Been Myth-sold? which takes the lid off the steamy but very profitable world of the bonds. And next month a working party at the Faculty and Institute of Actuaries - the insurance professionals whose decisions govern returns on with-profits investments - will warn of the dangers investors face if they place too much reliance on returns promised in marketing literature following an actuarial paper last June which told companies not to hype figures artificially. But individual actuaries admit that it will need more than a warning to prevent financial advisers from puffing the plus points and deleting, as far as legally possible, the drawbacks. Commission on these products is very high - the Prudential has, in the past, offered some IFAs up to 7% on its top-selling Prudence Bond. Others include Eagle Star and Scottish Widows, also paying advisers up to 7% of what you pay in. Britannic and Sun Life pay a maximum 6.75%, and many others are at levels up to 6%. Sums invested in these bonds are large, typically \u00a325,000, therefore earning advisers up to \u00a31,750. These commissions are twice the level paid to advisers when the recommend a unit trust. And while some advisers discount part or even all of this commission, many insurers are now paying annual \"renewal\" commission whose cost has, ultimately, to come from investors. Those working for banks and insurers directly do not generally rebate. T he suspicion remains that the bonds are pushed by advisers simply because the pay more commission than unit trusts. Yet the advisers' own professional body, the Chartered Insurance Institute, says: \"There should not be incentives that might create a bias towards plans where higher initial commission is paid to advisers.\" But potential difficulties go beyond high commission. \"These bonds have been gaining in popularity just when the bonus rates on which they depend have been dropping and the volatility of the funds has been increasing. These are supposed to be safe investments where the ups and downs are smoothed out but they are becoming increasingly risky as they become more reliant on equities to produce returns,\" Mr Milton says. With-profits bond money is managed in a very similar way to endowment mortgages and with-profits pension funds. But returns from these funds are falling. This month, insurance companies are declaring annual bonuses and, according to figures from second-hand policy dealer Beale Dobie, of the ones to declare annual, or reversionary, bonuses so far, three have fallen, four are unchanged and one very small player has risen. \"The money going into with-profits bonds ends up in the same pots as used by endowment policies to fund mortgages like the ones now suffering awful performance projections and fears of mis-selling,\" says Mr Milton. \"People don't realise that mutual companies pay regulatory fines and compensation for mis-selling out of with-profits funds. Other companies may even try subsidising loss-making stakeholder pensions from with-profits funds,\" he adds. We asked leading providers whether they offered high initial rates and how their rates had moved. Friend s Provident has a first year guarantee ranging from 5% on \u00a33,000 to 8.5% on \u00a3100,000. It justifies not alerting customers to the potential of falling rates because the plans do not have a target, unlike endowments. Norwich Union had a 25% market share last year. It says it complies with PIA guidelines on projection rates used and supports the Faculty and Institute of Actuaries on the promotion or marketing of headline bonus rates. NU does not declare high first year bonus rates and will not be doing so in the future. Since 1997 rates have fallen from 7.25% to 5.75%. Legal &amp; General has a confusing variety of products but says each year's plan is managed separately. It is replacing penalties for withdrawal in certain circumstances by managing a combination of lower annual growth rates plus higher terminal bonuses. Liverpool Victoria has around \u00a34.5bn in its bonds which offer a guaranteed 7.5% over the first two years by \"creating additional units.\" Royal &amp; Sun Alliance Annual bonuses have fallen from 7% in 1996 to 5% in 2000. It says: \"Our aim is to be fair to all policyholders by offering appropriate bonus rates, rather than trying to attract business by offering inflated rates at the outset.\" Standard Life has only been selling bonds since last August. Its bonus rate is 4.5%. There are no special deals. Scottish Friendly guarantees 6% in the first year but it will not market using \"an artificially high rate only to cut it dramatically in subsequent years\". Bonus rates have fallen from 7% to 6% since 1998. Prudential, Scottish Widows and Scottish Mutual were unable to reply. Truth that lies behind the fanciful claims With profits bonds have been one of the most successful investment products of the past decade - seeming to square the circle of safety combined with high returns. But they are far harder to fathom than unit or investment trusts. And that lets the insurers try to weasel their way into potential buyers' affections with big print claims that could be too good to be true. Here we examine assertions and reality. \"Your money is safe - your capital can never fall. \" True, but only up to a point. Many bonds take up to 5% upfront to cover charges including commission. But despite the reputation with-profits funds have of never falling back, the bond companies have the market value adjustment or 'MVA' in reserve. They all say this is rarely used but many wanting their money back during the 1998 Asian crisis suffered an Equitable Life style deduction of around 10%. Bonds often offer MVA-free encashments on the fifth or ten anniversary and always on death. Most say they never (or hardly ever) apply the adjustment. But what happens if shares melt down as they did in Japan where the Nikkei index is little more than a third of its 1989 value? \"The returns on with-profits bonds are totally free of basic rate tax and capital gains tax.\" Technically true but otherwise to be taken with a pinch of salt. Insurance funds are hit by corporation tax which is the equivalent of basic tax and capital gains tax. Non and lower rate taxpayers lose out while most basic rate payers do so as well as they cannot use their capital gains tax annual exemption - currently \u00a37,200. This contrasts strongly with Isas. The only possible winners from the tax treatment are higher rate taxpayers and those caught in the age allowance trap. \"You can have tax-free withdrawals.\" This is true up to 5% of the original sum paid in. But as the fund has already paid tax, further payments would would add up to double deductions. \"Bonds invest in a wide portfolio to provide a consistent return by smoothing out the ups and downs of the stock market\" That's what they should do. But to produce the rates investors demand (and sellers need to justify commissions), insurers have to use higher proportions of volatile shares. The effect is that annual growth rates are variable, not smooth. And if markets fall with a bump, the annual bonus will be very low, the terminal bonus practically non existent while exits will be barred by the MVA. \"You get an allocation of 103% of your original investment.\" Sounds great - more money from the outset but this depends on what you regard as your original investment. Savers with \u00a310,000 see it as \u00a310,000. Insurers take off 5% upfront and call it \u00a39,500 of which 103% is only \u00a39,885. \"We rebate all the commission\" Ask what happens to any annual renewal payments - advisers cannot live on air. \"No annual management charges\" True as far as it goes. There are no explicit charges in with-profits bonds. But insurance actuaries adjust bonuses to take care of expenses. \"Higher current returns than on deposit accounts\" Remains true but for how long - and will it apply to all bonds?",

The Cabinet Office's Performance and Innovation Unit has set up a task force which has nine months to report on the skills shortage problem in the UK. So-called third-leg funding for universities to liaise with businesses to ensure that degree courses teach relevant skills to students has been tripled. </p> <p>The problem has been bubbling under for the past 10 years as the country moved from recession in the early 90s into a period of full employment, as defined by economist John Maynard Keynes. Companies which slashed recruitment and training budgets in the lean times failed to reinflate them as the economy picked up. </p> <p>Neil Barnes, director of media recruitment specialists Phee Farrar Jones, says the problem has arisen because of a lack of investment in graduate recruitment. \"The underlying reason is because companies have not pre-planned graduate recruitment in the past so they don't have the talent coming through the company. Particularly in the area of new media there has also been the problem of sheer growth. It would have been a very brave person indeed who could have predicted numbers needed even three years ago. Although some start-ups have failed, others have grown beyond their wildest dreams.\" </p> <p>Kevin Hogarth, national resourcing director at professional services group Ernst &amp; Young, agrees: \"We're trying to recruit people who started their training in the early 90s and effectively we're reaping what we sowed. Numbers of graduate recruits were much reduced in all the accountancy firms because of economic conditions. Now we're trying to broaden the net of people we can attract who may have relevant experience.\" </p> <p>In the public sector, recruitment difficulties have more to do with poor pay and overwork. A spokeswoman for the public sector workers' union Unison says: \"There is a huge problem with a lack of social workers, particularly in inner city areas. Pay is always an issue, but there is also the problem of caseloads. Lisa Artherworry, the care worker involved in the Anna Climbie case, had 50% more work that she should have done, although I'm not excusing what happened. With residential social work there is even more of a problem: it is even worse paid and the environment is very difficult - you often find that there will be just one person sleeping in the home alone when there should be two people there.\" </p> <p>Separately, the Cabinet Office this week published a paper on the role immigrants can fill in helping slake the staffing drought as more and more blue-chip companies are actively recruiting in Europe, Australia, New Zealand and India. Essex County Council is already forced abroad by staffing gaps: it employs social workers from South Africa. Ernst &amp; Young is launching its first careers round in India next month. But Mr Howells warns that for Britain simply to import workers from overseas would mean that \"we have not convinced enough of our people there are viable careers here and they should retrain for them\". </p> <p>Tom Hadley, senior policy adviser and manager of the Employee Relocation Council at the CBI, says: \"We are keen to stress that bringing in foreign labour needs to be seen in conjunction with a number of other solutions. It is part of an on-going debate. But we see this as a positive thing. It is an advantage to get people from overseas: a lot of companies are operating in a global marketplace and it is an advantage to have multicultural teams.\" He adds that the international exchange of personnel is just that, an exchange, and that British companies are using overseas relocation as one of their development tools. </p> <p>But back to the US, and New York recruitment consultant Rohit Sawhney says there has been a dire shortage of IT experts in the US for two years. The government has relaxed quotas on its business visa, meaning that 190,000 immigrants are now allowed into the country to work compared with 65,000 previously. \"The situation has altered slightly, however. Whereas last year companies would just take on anyone, employers are now far more selective. This is because the website infrastructure is now in place and people are needed just to enhance it, which can wait. There is no longer a mad rush for staff,\" say Mr Sawhney. </p> <p>But he adds that the upshift in the number of immigrants allowed in the US has not had the anticipated effect in the major cities such as New York and New Jersey: large corporations are increasingly unwilling to go to the expense of relocating an IT expert from India or New Zealand who is under no contractual obligation to stay. </p> <p>Mr Hogarth says overseas recruiting will be just one way of plugging the gap. His company has also been forced to accept beefing up the quality of jobs offered to graduate employees, as well as taking on non-graduates into areas where a degree has, in the past, been a pre-requisite for working. \"To fill vacancies we're not frightened of paying. What does frighten us more is the number of vacancies unfilled. We have literally hundreds of vacancies - I would say that vacancies are up 25% on this time last year.\" Qualified accountants with experience, tax and corporate finance specialists are particularly in short supply. </p> <p>\"Now we're trying to broaden the net of people we can attract who may have relevant experience. We're also looking at the way we undertake audits. We're defining separate roles so we can now focus graduates on developing skills for their longer term career, whereas in the past they had to do some tedious stuff as well,\" he says. </p> <p><strong>Where it's hurting worst</strong></p> <p><strong> City</strong><br> </p> <p> \"There are skills shortages across the board in the City, whether you are looking for professional accountants, bankers or legal personnel,\" says Alison Smith, director of recruitment consultants Badenoch &amp; Clark. The situation is a vicious circle: increasingly people are rejecting the City's long working hours, which means employers demanding more of their staff as they cannot find enough people to do the work. \"But if firms were more willing to train those with potential or retrain those with redundant skills, flexible working practices have more chance of happening,\" she says. </p> <p><strong> IT</strong><br> </p> <p> Recruitment consultants Computer People say the most sought-after IT experts are people with Java, C++, telecoms and Wap knowledge. High-level database skills such as Unix and Linux are also much in demand. \"The increased demand for Java skills does not seem to be abating, but companies are now being more realistic about the availability of such people and are prepared to look at candidates with OO and procedural programming skills. Graduates with OO skills are finding it easier to get first-time work and training on the job,\" says a spokeswoman. The average hourly rate for a Java developer in London is \u00a370, but can be as high as \u00a390 with experience in some sectors. </p> <p><strong> Charities</strong><br> </p> <p> While higher salaries in the sector, plus growing interest in jobs which benefit the community or environment, should mean a glut of candidates, charities are experiencing \"severe recruitment difficulties\", according to the Voluntary Sector National Training Council in England. \"There have been particular problems with charities in London and the south-east, where applications for jobs have declined severely in the last six to nine months. Charities are being forced to be far more lateral in the way in which they look for staff: they will take on people with sales experience to work in fundraising,\" says a spokesman. </p> <p><strong> Hospitality</strong><br> </p> <p> \"The hospitality and tourism industry is the fastest-growing job sector in the world,\" according to Anne Walker, managing director of Springboard UK, an independent organisation promoting career opportunities in the leisure industry. \"There are skills shortages at almost all levels and with every category of staff. There are currently 30,000 vacancies for chefs in this country: one of the problems is that cooking is not on the national curriculum.\" </p> <p><strong> Media</strong><br> </p> <p> John Foscolo, tutor at the Cardiff Centre for Journalism Studies, says there are more jobs on weekly papers than at any time in his eight years in teaching. \"I've never seen anything like it. There are far more jobs than students to fill them. It's because so many have been going into dot.coms because they pay so much better than weekly papers. On daily papers the jobs market is pretty good too as people are moving round so much. You've got to be trained, though. Papers want to put you straight to work. In PR there are so many jobs you can name your price.\" </p> <p><strong> Teaching</strong><br> </p> <p> Education secretary David Blunkett last year admitted that had salaries of \u00a36,000 not been introduced for teachers in training the situation would have been \"very close to meltdown\".Stories of schools cancelling classes because of staff shortages are increasingly common. Areas with shortfalls are London and the south-east in maths, technology, science and foreign languages: trainees in these areas now receive a golden hello of \u00a34,000. </p> <p><strong> Occupational therapy</strong><br> </p> <p> \"We have noticed a huge increase in the number of posts for occupational therapists advertised in our publications and we know there are not enough to deliver the service users need. We believe that nationwide the shortage is running at 20%,\" says Sheelagh Richards, chief executive of the College of Occupational Therapists. An Audit Commission report published last June showed that the gravest shortages were at the most senior level. According to NHS figures, the highest vacancy rates are in London, followed by the east, then the west midlands. </p> <p><strong> Social work</strong><br> </p> <p> According to an Employers' Organisation survey published in April 2000, there was a 16% vacancy rate nationally for social workers, rising to almost 20% in London, the south east and east Anglia - that is, one in five positions was unfilled. According to a spokesman for the organisation, there is no evidence that this has changed in the nine months since, but the problem had doubled in severity in the 18 months since the previous survey. In London and the home counties there are now around 500 vacancies for field social workers.</p>",

Pay is always an issue, but there is also the problem of caseloads. Lisa Artherworry, the care worker involved in the Anna Climbie case, had 50% more work that she should have done, although I'm not excusing what happened. With residential social work there is even more of a problem: it is even worse paid and the environment is very difficult - you often find that there will be just one person sleeping in the home alone when there should be two people there.\" Separately, the Cabinet Office this week published a paper on the role immigrants can fill in helping slake the staffing drought as more and more blue-chip companies are actively recruiting in Europe, Australia, New Zealand and India. Essex County Council is already forced abroad by staffing gaps: it employs social workers from South Africa. Ernst &amp; Young is launching its first careers round in India next month. But Mr Howells warns that for Britain simply to import workers from overseas would mean that \"we have not convinced enough of our people there are viable careers here and they should retrain for them\". Tom Hadley, senior policy adviser and manager of the Employee Relocation Council at the CBI, says: \"We are keen to stress that bringing in foreign labour needs to be seen in conjunction with a number of other solutions. It is part of an on-going debate. But we see this as a positive thing. It is an advantage to get people from overseas: a lot of companies are operating in a global marketplace and it is an advantage to have multicultural teams.\" He adds that the international exchange of personnel is just that, an exchange, and that British companies are using overseas relocation as one of their development tools. But back to the US, and New York recruitment consultant Rohit Sawhney says there has been a dire shortage of IT experts in the US for two years. The government has relaxed quotas on its business visa, meaning that 190,000 immigrants are now allowed into the country to work compared with 65,000 previously. \"The situation has altered slightly, however. Whereas last year companies would just take on anyone, employers are now far more selective. This is because the website infrastructure is now in place and people are needed just to enhance it, which can wait. There is no longer a mad rush for staff,\" say Mr Sawhney. But he adds that the upshift in the number of immigrants allowed in the US has not had the anticipated effect in the major cities such as New York and New Jersey: large corporations are increasingly unwilling to go to the expense of relocating an IT expert from India or New Zealand who is under no contractual obligation to stay. Mr Hogarth says overseas recruiting will be just one way of plugging the gap. His company has also been forced to accept beefing up the quality of jobs offered to graduate employees, as well as taking on non-graduates into areas where a degree has, in the past, been a pre-requisite for working. \"To fill vacancies we're not frightened of paying. What does frighten us more is the number of vacancies unfilled. We have literally hundreds of vacancies - I would say that vacancies are up 25% on this time last year.\" Qualified accountants with experience, tax and corporate finance specialists are particularly in short supply. \"Now we're trying to broaden the net of people we can attract who may have relevant experience. We're also looking at the way we undertake audits. We're defining separate roles so we can now focus graduates on developing skills for their longer term career, whereas in the past they had to do some tedious stuff as well,\" he says. Where it's hurting worst City \"There are skills shortages across the board in the City, whether you are looking for professional accountants, bankers or legal personnel,\" says Alison Smith, director of recruitment consultants Badenoch &amp; Clark. The situation is a vicious circle: increasingly people are rejecting the City's long working hours, which means employers demanding more of their staff as they cannot find enough people to do the work. \"But if firms were more willing to train those with potential or retrain those with redundant skills, flexible working practices have more chance of happening,\" she says. IT Recruitment consultants Computer People say the most sought-after IT experts are people with Java, C++, telecoms and Wap knowledge. High-level database skills such as Unix and Linux are also much in demand. \"The increased demand for Java skills does not seem to be abating, but companies are now being more realistic about the availability of such people and are prepared to look at candidates with OO and procedural programming skills. Graduates with OO skills are finding it easier to get first-time work and training on the job,\" says a spokeswoman. The average hourly rate for a Java developer in London is \u00a370, but can be as high as \u00a390 with experience in some sectors. Charities While higher salaries in the sector, plus growing interest in jobs which benefit the community or environment, should mean a glut of candidates, charities are experiencing \"severe recruitment difficulties\", according to the Voluntary Sector National Training Council in England. \"There have been particular problems with charities in London and the south-east, where applications for jobs have declined severely in the last six to nine months. Charities are being forced to be far more lateral in the way in which they look for staff: they will take on people with sales experience to work in fundraising,\" says a spokesman. Hospitality \"The hospitality and tourism industry is the fastest-growing job sector in the world,\" according to Anne Walker, managing director of Springboard UK, an independent organisation promoting career opportunities in the leisure industry. \"There are skills shortages at almost all levels and with every category of staff. There are currently 30,000 vacancies for chefs in this country: one of the problems is that cooking is not on the national curriculum.\" Media John Foscolo, tutor at the Cardiff Centre for Journalism Studies, says there are more jobs on weekly papers than at any time in his eight years in teaching. \"I've never seen anything like it. There are far more jobs than students to fill them. It's because so many have been going into dot.coms because they pay so much better than weekly papers. On daily papers the jobs market is pretty good too as people are moving round so much. You've got to be trained, though. Papers want to put you straight to work. In PR there are so many jobs you can name your price.\" Teaching Education secretary David Blunkett last year admitted that had salaries of \u00a36,000 not been introduced for teachers in training the situation would have been \"very close to meltdown\".Stories of schools cancelling classes because of staff shortages are increasingly common. Areas with shortfalls are London and the south-east in maths, technology, science and foreign languages: trainees in these areas now receive a golden hello of \u00a34,000. Occupational therapy \"We have noticed a huge increase in the number of posts for occupational therapists advertised in our publications and we know there are not enough to deliver the service users need. We believe that nationwide the shortage is running at 20%,\" says Sheelagh Richards, chief executive of the College of Occupational Therapists. An Audit Commission report published last June showed that the gravest shortages were at the most senior level. According to NHS figures, the highest vacancy rates are in London, followed by the east, then the west midlands. Social work According to an Employers' Organisation survey published in April 2000, there was a 16% vacancy rate nationally for social workers, rising to almost 20% in London, the south east and east Anglia - that is, one in five positions was unfilled. According to a spokesman for the organisation, there is no evidence that this has changed in the nine months since, but the problem had doubled in severity in the 18 months since the previous survey. In London and the home counties there are now around 500 vacancies for field social workers.",
