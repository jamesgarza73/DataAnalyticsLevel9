      "body": "<p>Noisy may not sound the most obvious technical term, but it's just right to describe the precarious new world of internet sports sites. Things are definitely noisy. Insiders use the word a lot. But noisy should not be confused with successful or money-spinning. Quite the contrary. There have been some spectacular failures already and there will be more. Noisy means restless movement as the entrepreneurial class try to make money out of a medium that promised so much and has delivered rather less. So far, the only ones who have done conspicuously well out of sports sites are those who got in early and sold out for a fat profit - often to someone who then made a fat loss. </p> <p>Those keen to invest have a frightening role model, worldsport.com, which had contracts to provide websites for dozens of international sports federations, but, embarrassingly, had its London operation closed down in the autumn while some of its staff were working at the Sydney Olympic Games. Worldsport.com was set up two years ago by Alan Callan, the one-time business manager for Led Zeppelin who made a fortune from rugby union TV rights and marketing, and, at the time, had seemed a sure thing. But the internet is much more of a gamble than TV, and by last summer worldsport was having to take cost-cutting measures to stay afloat and in October it sank. Those who thought purveyors of sports information teaming up with the internet was a match made in El Dorado were suddenly having to think again. </p> <p>'The problem is that nobody apart from our friend Mr Gates has any comprehension of the cost involved with setting up a website, having to maintain the technology and continually go through market development,' says internet analyst James Lowry. 'In the internet industry, three weeks is equal to a year in other media and unless you're being continually innovative, which no one can afford to be in a start-up company, you don't have a product that's going to move forward.' Which is why, as they battle to survive, the sports sites are prepared to go to considerable lengths. Cricinfo, the globally popular cricket site, has established a base in India, where low wages keep down costs. Nearly all sites are desperate to do deals - with sports federations, broadcasters, other websites - just so long as there's money in it. </p> <p>At the outset, sports site speculators pinned their hopes on making money through advertising. But this has never proved nearly sufficient to support the industry, even though last year the ad spend was about \u00a3120 million in the UK. Typically, an advertiser will pay \u00a320 for a unit of 1,000 banner ad appearances - or \u00a310,000 for half a million - which will be pulled in one at a time on each occasion someone makes an impression by requesting a page. Two years ago, when the internet still had some sort of novelty value for users, people would click on a banner advertisement 1.0 to 1.5 per cent of the time, a click-rate that is down to 0.4 to 0.5 per cent. That means for every 1,000 visitors to a page, only four will click on an advert. It might be spurious to compare that with newspapers, but for an indicator, that 0.4 per cent is competing with a figure of more than 100 per cent in the print media. </p> <p>For every 1,000 copies of The Observer sold, advertisers would reach more than that number of readers in the sports section, because every copy is read, on average by more than two people, and well over half of those go to the sports section. 'It's getting a hell of a lot harder to get people to leave a website and go on to whatever you're trying to advertise,' says Patrick Griffith, of the online media agency i-level. But advertisers are not deserting the internet even if they are not turning it into the money-minting machine that it was expected to be. They still regard it as a valuable branding tool and it gives a feedback that no other medium does. 'Online is totally accountable,' says Griffith. 'You know exactly what's worked and what hasn't.' </p> <p>Crucially, though, the advertisers have failed to make the sports site owners rich, or even bail them out in some instances, and other revenue possibilities have been unable to compensate. These include revenue share deals, which, through the technology that can identify the site that was responsible for a sale, enable that site and the manufacturer to divide up the profit; 'sports shops', whereby a site will act as a licensee to a manufacturer; sponsorship of a particular feature of a website - live score services are particularly popular; and syndication of content, such as journalism. </p> <p>All of which has failed to stop new speculators entering the noisy world of sports sites, which, to be fair, is still a young one and as such is bound to have a high rate of failures (generally, new businesses are reckoned to fold at a rate of more than 80 per cent). One of the more interesting recent concepts is sports stars having their own sites, such as those run by icons.com, which launched last June and is already working with more than 100 footballers, including Ryan Giggs, Robbie Fowler and Marc Overmars, who used his site to announce his move from Arsenal last July. </p> <p>James Freedman, the chief executive of icons.com, who established his reputation in the sporting media by successfully launching the Manchester United magazine, says: 'The trouble with lots of sports sites is they all have the same content so it's difficult to differentiate. What we provide is unique content. We are offering football fans direct access to their favourite players, who like this method of communicating because their words aren't taken out of context or sensationalised or treated in a scurrilous way.' </p> <p>Through a combination of advertising revenue, e-commerce - the sale of merchandising - and a series of deals syndicating to a whole range of traditional media, Freedman says he is confident icons.com will become profitable in the next year to 18 months. And that would make him a bigger noise than most in the noisy world of sport in cyberspace.</p>",

No longer is the information superhighway a sheet of newspaper pinned to the betting shop wall. Punting has moved on forever to tax-free, spoilt-for-choice, secluded study, and in turn helped to bring its own changes. </p> <p>One of the biggest could be on its way in March, when the Government decides whether to abolish general betting duty. It has been under duress to axe the tax ever since British bookmakers shifted all but their betting shops to offshore havens, where there is no need to charge the nine per cent deduction that now makes betting shops so unappealing. What kind of industry is it where Ladbrokes languish in Gibraltar, and William Hill work from Antigua? Idiosyncrasies like these are the work of the internet because one of the main drivers of the online revolution has been gambling, not Amazon or QXL. Easy access, rapid delivery, deep satisfaction at what once was the coalface, but is now the interface. </p> <p>If betting duty vanishes then betting shops could be tax-free just like the online bookmaker, yet for all their allure they are already in danger of becoming the forgotten cousin. Money is being thrown at attracting a newer audience to betting, \u00a35 million to online marketing in Ladbrokes' case, solely to target the 83 per cent of the population who never have a bet. On the understanding that worldwide telephone and internet betting could surpass \u00a3630m by the end of this year, and that every adult in Britain could have mobile internet access by 2010, it's quite a market. Another estimate from Dutch banker ABN-Amro puts internet betting within three years at \u00a36bn. </p> <p>Clearly some people are going to make a fortune from punters (who should be cautious - one British betting site, betachance.com, closed down last week. Punters logging on to the site were met with a message stating that no bets would be taken until 26 January because of 'a complete systems change'). To now there has only been a monopoly banker, the bookmakers, but built into the staggering ABN-Amro estimate is a mighty imponderable - interactive TV betting. This is part of the reason Sky could up the ante to \u00a32bn for football rights or why Sky, with Channel 4, are willing to enter a deal worth \u00a375m a year to cover horse racing, compared to the \u00a318m racing earns at present each year for its terrestrial and satellite rights. </p> <p>Once technology allows high-resolution live action pictures on the internet the belief is that sports broadcasts on the web's many platforms will generate betting in areas of the world totally unconsidered for business. The theory is that of satisfying the displaced fan. He is able to see the action and, if so inclined, bet on it at the same time, anywhere in the world. Investing in this dreamy landscape has already begun. Evidence abounds of websites trying to build a loyal following of surfers in the hope and expectation at some point of live pictures and betting. Those are the twin towers that will bring forth riches so long as the principal buyer of the rights plays ball. </p> <p>Before that happens, established content websites like onefootball.com, cricinfo and sports.com operate in a certain state of limbo. They can carry news, views, interviews, games, hotlinks to bookmakers, even minute-by-minute bulletins of live games, but it all leaves the user crying out for pictures. It's like kissing your sister. Trial runs of live action have been hit and miss. Ascot held a webcast of the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Stakes in July, but it looked intermittently like a blizzard on a go-slow, then in November William Hill showed Celtic's Uefa Cup defeat to Bordeaux, with 'in-game' odds alongside on the same screen, to greater acclaim. </p> <p>William Hill is one bookmaker that is ahead of the game as a strategic partner providing fixed odds betting to the live greyhound racing site at <a href=\"http://www.24dogs.com\">www.24dogs.com</a> strategic alliances are the vogue. Did cable company ntl invest millions in Aston Villa, Newcastle, Celtic, Rangers and the Swansea and Newport rugby clubs because Mr Chairman likes a day out? The broadcast rights owned by the clubs are potentially worth a fortune. Tom Jessiman, managing director at sports.com has $62m of funding behind him to cover expenses in the wait for the future. </p> <p>'The market for buying video rights is multi-billion dollar,' he said. 'We're going to have to partner with the rights holders and, as live video starts to work better online, the rights holders will soon see the income streams. We'll be doing that ahead of the traditional betting sites, its two to three years out, and there's definitely a market for pay-per-view for the displaced fan. I can see him or her shelling out \u00a35 to see the Liverpool match, even if its on slightly delayed footage. 'But the big revenues will come from gambling, even bigger than pay-per-view, and especially from the Far East.

      "bodyText": "I haven't had a bet in the bookies for two years, because of the internet. When it comes to the cold business of betting there is no comparison. No longer is the information superhighway a sheet of newspaper pinned to the betting shop wall. Punting has moved on forever to tax-free, spoilt-for-choice, secluded study, and in turn helped to bring its own changes. One of the biggest could be on its way in March, when the Government decides whether to abolish general betting duty. It has been under duress to axe the tax ever since British bookmakers shifted all but their betting shops to offshore havens, where there is no need to charge the nine per cent deduction that now makes betting shops so unappealing. What kind of industry is it where Ladbrokes languish in Gibraltar, and William Hill work from Antigua? Idiosyncrasies like these are the work of the internet because one of the main drivers of the online revolution has been gambling, not Amazon or QXL. Easy access, rapid delivery, deep satisfaction at what once was the coalface, but is now the interface. If betting duty vanishes then betting shops could be tax-free just like the online bookmaker, yet for all their allure they are already in danger of becoming the forgotten cousin. Money is being thrown at attracting a newer audience to betting, \u00a35 million to online marketing in Ladbrokes' case, solely to target the 83 per cent of the population who never have a bet. On the understanding that worldwide telephone and internet betting could surpass \u00a3630m by the end of this year, and that every adult in Britain could have mobile internet access by 2010, it's quite a market. Another estimate from Dutch banker ABN-Amro puts internet betting within three years at \u00a36bn. Clearly some people are going to make a fortune from punters (who should be cautious - one British betting site, betachance.com, closed down last week. Punters logging on to the site were met with a message stating that no bets would be taken until 26 January because of 'a complete systems change'). To now there has only been a monopoly banker, the bookmakers, but built into the staggering ABN-Amro estimate is a mighty imponderable - interactive TV betting. This is part of the reason Sky could up the ante to \u00a32bn for football rights or why Sky, with Channel 4, are willing to enter a deal worth \u00a375m a year to cover horse racing, compared to the \u00a318m racing earns at present each year for its terrestrial and satellite rights. Once technology allows high-resolution live action pictures on the internet the belief is that sports broadcasts on the web's many platforms will generate betting in areas of the world totally unconsidered for business. The theory is that of satisfying the displaced fan. He is able to see the action and, if so inclined, bet on it at the same time, anywhere in the world. Investing in this dreamy landscape has already begun. Evidence abounds of websites trying to build a loyal following of surfers in the hope and expectation at some point of live pictures and betting. Those are the twin towers that will bring forth riches so long as the principal buyer of the rights plays ball. Before that happens, established content websites like onefootball.com, cricinfo and sports.com operate in a certain state of limbo. They can carry news, views, interviews, games, hotlinks to bookmakers, even minute-by-minute bulletins of live games, but it all leaves the user crying out for pictures. It's like kissing your sister. Trial runs of live action have been hit and miss. Ascot held a webcast of the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Stakes in July, but it looked intermittently like a blizzard on a go-slow, then in November William Hill showed Celtic's Uefa Cup defeat to Bordeaux, with 'in-game' odds alongside on the same screen, to greater acclaim. William Hill is one bookmaker that is ahead of the game as a strategic partner providing fixed odds betting to the live greyhound racing site at www.24dogs.com strategic alliances are the vogue. Did cable company ntl invest millions in Aston Villa, Newcastle, Celtic, Rangers and the Swansea and Newport rugby clubs because Mr Chairman likes a day out? The broadcast rights owned by the clubs are potentially worth a fortune. Tom Jessiman, managing director at sports.com has $62m of funding behind him to cover expenses in the wait for the future. 'The market for buying video rights is multi-billion dollar,' he said. 'We're going to have to partner with the rights holders and, as live video starts to work better online, the rights holders will soon see the income streams. We'll be doing that ahead of the traditional betting sites, its two to three years out, and there's definitely a market for pay-per-view for the displaced fan. I can see him or her shelling out \u00a35 to see the Liverpool match, even if its on slightly delayed footage. 'But the big revenues will come from gambling, even bigger than pay-per-view, and especially from the Far East. The power of the Premiership as a global brand is immense.' As access to the internet on TV and on mobile phones edges closer to the average consumer so the stakes in the race begin to grow. A couple of weeks ago the website intertops.com claimed its 15 millionth bet in five years since launch, or one every 10 seconds without fail. 'The phenomenal growth of the internet has had an incredible effect on gaming business,' said intertops' co-founder Simon Noble. 'We are experiencing a 30 to 40 per cent growth rate every year in bets taken on the popular sporting events, and this year will be no exception.' Intertops talks a good game.

      "body": "<p>It has been billed as a revolution that will reshape the viewing habits of armchair sports lovers everywhere. In the future, fans will be able to see any piece of sporting action they fancy any time, any place, anywhere. Nicolas Anelka's unlikely return to Highbury in Arsenal's reserve game from your Singapore hotel room? No problem; just log in and call it up. Meanwhile, the players, clubs, ruling bodies, sports internet sites and television companies will make shedloads of cash for making that happen. So everyone wins. All through harnessing the wonders and benefits of the new media to sport's billions-strong global audience. </p> <p>So much for the theory. The practice so far has been very different. All revolutions start somewhere and, almost unnoticed, this one began in Glasgow's East End on 24 August last year. Celtic v Jeunesse Esch of Luxembourg in the Uefa Cup qualifying round was the first time any football club in Europe, and possibly the world, had broadcast one of its games in live pictures over the internet. As an historic event, it was a serious letdown. It was less the quality of the game, a 7-0 walkover for Celtic, than the quality of the pictures. Initially good, albeit not television standard, they got progressively grainier and slower as more users joined the broadcast until this ground-breaking 'live transmission' became merely a succession of still pictures accompanied by a live commentary. Result: frustration for 33,000 Hoops fans who had been relishing the unprecedented opportunity of watching a match on their personal computer, at home or work, courtesy of celticfc.net. </p> <p>Nevertheless this fledgling webcast was still sport's equivalent of Neil Armstrong's 'one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind'. Despite the problems, it showed that live pictures of sports events could be transmitted over the web - a breakthrough of potentially huge significance, given the internet's global reach. Racing and boxing also dabbled with live web broadcasts last year, to smaller audiences and in shorter bursts of action, and they, too suffered problems with picture quality. Iain Reid, project director of celticfc.net, said, 'It was a success in that we got it out there. But it was more of an experiment, a learning experience about what the internet is capable of at this stage, and especially about the technical difficulties of streaming a game. And obviously a useful service to the fans.' Those technical difficulties did not deter the supporters. When Celtic played Helsinki in the next round, 40,000 tuned in, 7,000 more than the first time. Fans around the world were glad to see something they would otherwise only have read or heard about. </p> <p>That is a microcosm of the internet's appeal as a live sport medium for fans. It offers the chance to watch something you would otherwise not have seen, and to do so when, where and how it suits you. Despite Rupert Murdoch's best efforts, not every sports event in the world is shown on television - or not on a channel you can watch. Which is where the internet comes in and cleans up. In theory. A combination of all that unfulfilled viewing interest among sports fans and the increasingly prominent role of new technology in our lives has led to plenty of fanciful predictions. Not just that the internet will drastically alter fans' consumption of sport but that it will sweep away the huge power of the TV companies and make a lot of people a lot of money - by converting all of us into fee-paying subscribers. But will it happen? Kevin Roberts, editor of Sport Business magazine, says the potential of applying new technology to sport is vast, both for consumers and commercial interests. But he is sceptical of the idea that every fan will want to pay to receive alerts on their mobile phone telling them of the latest goal. 'Do fans really want all the things that they'll soon be able to get?' Roberts asks. </p> <p>'Is it technology driving demand or vice versa? Look at the experience of WAP phones. They were heralded as a great revolution but they didn't live up to expectations. In future fans will have to pay for quality services, for anything other than a basic service offered by their club or sports internet provider. But will they do that? We don't even know that there's a market for this.' Nevertheless, Roberts thinks enough fans will eventually sign up to justify the mega-millions being invested in the sports internet sector. 'Fans want more than simply going into a chatroom to discuss why Teddy Sheringham has had a new lease of life. I suspect they will pay to see goals and have other services delivered to them, because the relationship between them and their club is so intense - but only if the pricing is right. If it is, the potential audience is huge. But everything depends on pricing.' </p> <p>The investors believe that, just as millions of fans have subscribed to sports TV stations, so most of us will, eventually, pay for web-based services. Sports internet companies have been doing their figures, but none will say how much we will all be asked to stump up to see goals, highlights or exclusive interviews. To watch from your armchair will cost several hundred pounds a year, and mobile access will be extra. Stephen Nuttall, head of sport at Sportal, one of the biggest websites, reckons that within two years fans will be spending \u00a310 a month to access all sorts of content through as-yet-unavailable handsets called personal digital assistants - a combined mobile phone, palm pilot and video player - which will offer users text, video clips and audio services on the team or sport they follow. Nuttall stresses that pictures will rapidly become the defining factor. 'People will probably not want to watch an entire match on their PDA but if they can't watch an event on telly, they'll use it for updates and maybe action. If there's been a big pile-up at the first corner at Silverstone, or Paolo Di Canio's been sent off, it'll tell you that and let you see it if you want to.' </p> <p>Talk about price at this stage may well be premature anyway. Before details like that can be sorted out, two issues need to be clarified. When will the technology be easily available for access to all this stuff? And, when all the rights wars have been won and lost, what exactly will there be to watch? Sports internet companies insist that the much-heralded new means of watching webcasts, with pictures of TV quality rather than Celtic-Jeunesse Esch quality, could be available within two years. Graeme Ferguson, of Worldzap, says, 'In the beginning you could send text messages by mobile phone, then it was text and graphics, then came photos, audio and internet access. The imminent third generation of personal mobile devices means people will be able to receive far more data - especially pictures - than ever before.' Worldzap recently claimed a first when they delivered a goal from a Bundesliga match, 'as live' soon after it had been scored, to a futuristic mobile phone. But refinement of the technology will take some years. </p> <p>Technologically, the key is the development of 'broadband internet', a hugely enhanced version of what most of us can get on our PCs already and will allow us to receive those TV-quality pictures. TV and internet technology will fuse through a process of 'convergence' which may, ultimately, render the difference between old and new media obselete. David Wood, editor of specialist newsletter Broadband, says convergence will really take off in the next decade, but not in the next three or four years. While text-based services will grow, action will be the real lure for people thinking about signing up. The technology already exists but is prohibitively expensive. Despite bullish noises about broadband becoming widespread quite quickly, in reality rollout is unlikely to happen until the price has fallen to make it accessible, probably around 2005. According to one survey, by then 80 million homes in Europe are expected to have been converted to it. Only then can the revolution really start. </p> <p>Before then, there will also be a war between internet firms desperate to secure the rights to key competitions such as the World Cup, Premiership, Champions League and Formula One. That scramble will be intense because these companies need to recruit subscribers to raise the money to pay back investors who believed the hype and have sunk millions into them. Without attractive content, a sports website will die. But there are not enough events worth having to ensure everyone's survival. Leading clubs and ruling bodies will also launch their own paid-for services, using their own events as bait. Peter Kenyon, Manchester United's go-ahead chief executive, foresees a future where manutd.com has millions of users who, when the website merges with MUTV, will eventually start paying subscriptions, especially their vast army of fans outside Britain. It's easy to see how, given their global pulling power, United will earn many millions in extra income. Celtic hope to do the same, as do Arsenal and Liverpool through their links with Granada Media. </p> <p>But how much can Aston Villa or Everton, for example, expect to make in this way? And outside football, Formula One and America's big games, how many sports have enough fans to benefit in any serious way? The revolution could simply make rich clubs and sports richer, and pass everyone else by. At the moment, confusion reigns. Last month the International Olympic Committee held a two-day seminar in Switzerland that was meant to answer all the difficult questions about sport's fast-evolving relationship with new media. How would fans be affected? Who would make money and how? Would the internet replace TV or complement it? </p> <p>After endless presentations, discussions and analysis, Dick Pound, the IOC vice-president, admitted, 'We haven't the faintest idea what the new media rights to the Olympics are worth. The people in the industry have all these wonderful ideas, some of which are brilliant, but none of them knows how they're going to make money. And people don't seem to be willing to pay for content.' And the IOC's conclusion from two days of talks? No decisions on internet rights until 2010. It's too complicated. </p>",

      "body": "<p>John Gregory was sitting in his office at Aston Villa's Bodymoor Heath training ground on his first day in his new job when the phone rang. At the other end was the man he had just replaced in the job, Brian Little. </p> <p>The pair had worked together just 18 months earlier when Gregory had been Little's first-team coach before deciding to try his own hand at the managerial game with Wycombe Wanderers. Gregory asked for some advice from the man who had been there, seen it and worked with Villa's infamous chairman Doug Ellis - although he probably knew the answer before it was given. </p> <p>'You've got three years at the most,' said Little, 'you need to win something within three years or start looking for a new job.' This advice has stayed with him throughout his tenure at Villa Park and has underpinned virtually every move he has made. From day one he has stamped his mark on the job - in the knowledge that the sword of Damocles could be cut loose at any time. He took a strategic decision to do the job on his terms. In that time, he's become a Holte End cult hero and put a bit of dash and bravado into a club that has become the epitome of Premier League conservatism. </p> <p>However, he has discovered it harder to pull off than he first thought. To understand Gregory's problem, one has to get to grips with the men who employ him. Despite what the rank and file think, Ellis has done a fantastically good job at Villa Park. Yes, two decades ago Villa were the European Champions. But so too were Nottingham Forest. The club could not count itself among the six biggest in the Premiership, yet in terms of turnover it's the nineteenth-biggest in Europe. That was never the case when the self-made millionaire took over. The problem is that Ellis finds it difficult not to have a say in every part of the club - including the football. For example, Benito Carbone could have stayed at Villa for \u00a330,000 a week. Gregory was told this figure would smash the wage structure and the deal was a no-go. The result? Two months later, David Ginola arrives for \u00a33 million - on \u00a335,000 a week. </p> <p>Second, Gregory wants Benni McCarthy. The Ellis-led board harbours secret doubts about sanctioning an \u00a38m deal, saying the fee is too high.

      "bodyText": "John Gregory was sitting in his office at Aston Villa's Bodymoor Heath training ground on his first day in his new job when the phone rang. At the other end was the man he had just replaced in the job, Brian Little. The pair had worked together just 18 months earlier when Gregory had been Little's first-team coach before deciding to try his own hand at the managerial game with Wycombe Wanderers. Gregory asked for some advice from the man who had been there, seen it and worked with Villa's infamous chairman Doug Ellis - although he probably knew the answer before it was given. 'You've got three years at the most,' said Little, 'you need to win something within three years or start looking for a new job.' This advice has stayed with him throughout his tenure at Villa Park and has underpinned virtually every move he has made. From day one he has stamped his mark on the job - in the knowledge that the sword of Damocles could be cut loose at any time. He took a strategic decision to do the job on his terms. In that time, he's become a Holte End cult hero and put a bit of dash and bravado into a club that has become the epitome of Premier League conservatism. However, he has discovered it harder to pull off than he first thought. To understand Gregory's problem, one has to get to grips with the men who employ him. Despite what the rank and file think, Ellis has done a fantastically good job at Villa Park. Yes, two decades ago Villa were the European Champions. But so too were Nottingham Forest. The club could not count itself among the six biggest in the Premiership, yet in terms of turnover it's the nineteenth-biggest in Europe. That was never the case when the self-made millionaire took over. The problem is that Ellis finds it difficult not to have a say in every part of the club - including the football. For example, Benito Carbone could have stayed at Villa for \u00a330,000 a week. Gregory was told this figure would smash the wage structure and the deal was a no-go. The result? Two months later, David Ginola arrives for \u00a33 million - on \u00a335,000 a week. Second, Gregory wants Benni McCarthy. The Ellis-led board harbours secret doubts about sanctioning an \u00a38m deal, saying the fee is too high. They doubt whether South African McCarthy will play as many games as they hope because of his international commitments. Five months later, they stump up the cash to bring Colombian international Juan Pablo Angel to Villa Park for \u00a39.5m. Privately at least, it is those double standards that are driving the Villa boss to distraction. Former Villa manager Ron Atkinson is scathing about Ellis. His autobiography details the constant round of phone calls from the chairman. But even he once ate a piece of humble pie, making a pre-match call for unity on the PA system to a disgruntled Villa Park crowd when it sensed another potential signing, Dean Saunders, was going to slip from their grasp. Atkinson probably agreed with them but still swallowed his pride. Little, however, opted to meet as many of the chairman's requests as he could.

A while back, no one really understood what the implications of the Bosman ruling would be, even if we grasped the acceptable theory of freedom of movement at the end of a contract. The price of civil liberty has been tedious year-long stories of will-he, won't-he go. Then, while poor Bosman himself tries to rebuild his impecunious life, ungrateful players cash in to an extent that would send Bruce Grobbelaar's envy a darker shade of Alan Green. Now, ironically in the week that marks 40 years since the maximum wage was abolished in this country, even the players you speak to - at least the older ones who have enjoyed their life in the game and can now see a bigger picture - believe the balance of power has shifted too far the other way. </p> <p>They fear that if the transfer system breaks down totally, if players are allowed to hand in notice that they intend to move mid-contract for mind-boggling sums elsewhere, then their already-stretching loyalty will snap.

In Switzerland, Uefa and Fifa have fiddled all week as the smouldering threatens to turn into flames.

Except some desperate English ones, like Leeds United and Aston Villa. </p> <p>That may actually be no bad thing, come to think of it. Watching Villa play Newcastle United in midweek, what struck most was the sheer volume of average overseas players on view, particularly in the Newcastle midfield. Having written otherwise before Christmas, and seeing workaday Sunderland reach second place, I am coming round to the view that this is an ordinary Premiership. Surely managers can find cheaper, hungrier and teachable players just as average in the Nationwide League? At home, we hear of live and televised games being dotted wall-to-wall around the weekend TV schedules from next season, as if the current three-day event was not enough. </p> <p>What used to be a treat is in danger of becoming mere trifle. The greater exposure to mediocrity could well backfire. And here, let me share the experience of taking my son to Tottenham v Newcastle a few weeks ago. He loved it, all six goals and three red cards of it, which was gratifying. Only one player, Kieron Dyer, lifted it above the knockabout, however. And it cost \u00a396 for the two of us.

The debate, it seems, is about the money rather than the desirability of the English game being associated with those sponsors and the very product that has fuelled the country's disgrace at fixtures abroad. To cap it all, three judges decided that Grobbelaar, after all, had taken money to fix matches in the early Nineties. The FA were relieved when it went to judgment and went away; now it is back to open what Alan Partridge would call the whole nest of viper's eggs, fertilised by the bungs report.</p> <p>Contemplating football's week again, my mind gratefully recalled an encounter with Gareth Southgate on Wednesday night. Paul Merson had invited me for a meal in a Villa Park lounge after the match and we talked with Southgate. He had been forced off the pitch just before half-time with damaged knee ligaments and sat in some pain. He blamed nothing but his own poor control, which had led to his overstretching for a ball. In his 40-odd minutes on the pitch he showed the consistent composure that continues to make him one of England's most reliable and constructive defenders. </p> <p>This against a backdrop of his wanting a transfer, not for more money, but simply because he believes he would be more likely to win trophies elsewhere. Southgate has not agitated for the move, however, as some players might do, by refusing to play, or adopting a disruptive daily attitude that forces the manager to modify a prohibitive \u00a310 million price tag and get rid of him. Nor does he shield behind an agent who might do it on his behalf. </p> <p>Southgate has just got on with his job, trying to hold together a team that everyone knows is short of the top drawer. 'I can see it logically,' he admitted. 'Looking at it from the club's point of view, I suppose I wouldn't let me go either.' As Merson drove him home, Southgate stretched out on the back seat with his crutches. I asked him if he would like to be a manager one day. His reply was saddening. 'I would, but I'm not sure if you'll be in control of players, with all the changes coming into the game,' he said. And this is a man who would undoubtedly benefit from a change that would enable him just to hand in his notice. </p> <p>The thoughtful decent Southgate certainly has all the credentials to make an outstanding manager. If men like him do not stay in the game, football will suffer. It could mirror politics, where some of the best brains, the most able men, are frightened off by the cynical, peripheral stuff and nonsense. Southgate and honest players like him are the reason why you do stick with the grand, tattered old game. When it kicks off at 3pm on a Saturday (or a Sunday at 1pm, 4pm and possibly next season 7pm), the tosh of the previous seven days that surrounds it goes out of the window.

The march of fourth-division Calais to the French Cup Final last year was the most exciting thing to have happened to the French game since the World Cup, bigger, many thought, than winning Euro 2000. </p> <p>It was the best story in European football. </p> <p>Yesterday Calais tried to repeat it. About 9,000 of the town's citizens had come to Amiens in the Somme for this fourth-round cup-tie (Calais' own ground is not up to scratch) and most of them stood throughout. But this time their team were outclassed in a 3-1 defeat. </p> <p>Last year was extraordinary. This town of 80,000 people, where unemployment stands at 15 per cent and many of those who do have jobs earn next to nothing selling drink to British daytrippers, where the communists have held the town hall for three decades, captivated France. The players had to beg time off from their bosses to get to games, but ended up playing in the Stade de France, where they held Nantes until the 90th minute of the final before succumbing to a ludicrous penalty. They even got to meet Zinedine Zidane! It was a French version of The Full Monty, complete with shirt-stripping after the semi-final. </p> <p>Calais played yesterday with almost all of last year's heroes. They had hung on to them largely by promising them better jobs, which was not difficult since most of them worked in cash-and-carries and the like. Just after New Year, however, their playmaker Emmanuel Vasseur succumbed to the lure of big money. That is, he signed for Leyton Orient. </p> <p>Calais were furious, and seemed to have delayed the transfer but they were without Vasseur yesterday, though he was said to be among the crowd. Nico Thiriot, a wine buyer for Sainsbury's in England, son of the Calais managing director Claude Thiriot, raged: 'He's got a little brain, unfortunately'. </p> <p>Orient have offered to resolve the disputes by playing a friendly against Calais, but as Claude Thiriot noted: 'The whole world wants to play against us....' </p> <p>Calais, playing in baggy red-and-yellow shirts reminiscent of long ago, certainly seemed to miss Vasseur. They tackled vigorously, but had trouble controlling the ball, which kept bouncing off the wrong bits of their bodies. </p> <p>Sedan went ahead after 14 minutes. Moussa N'Diaye broke down the right, his cross beat the Calais defence, and Olivier Quint finished cleanly. At times Quint showed there is a difference between divisions, playing accurately at pace and creating several chances from the left wing. It's a shame that being a star in the French league nowadays means you have barely a chance of making the national team. </p> <p>For much of the first half Sedan played with Calais. Then Calais scored out of nothing. On 41 minutes, they were granted a mysterious free-kick to the right of the Sedan penalty area. The ball was lifted across, there was a tangle of bodies, a couple of players fell over, and suddenly the referee was pointing to the spot. </p> <p>The crowd roared, partly in disbelief. This was perhaps a compensation for the penalty that cost them the Cup last May. Reginald Becque placed the spot kick high in the side netting. </p> <p>It was the sort of Somme evening that made you understand why First World War memoirs were so obsessed with the weather. It was so cold that every toe hurt, and in the second half the air grew white with freezing mist. </p> <p>The match - the context aside - was depressing. Sedan are out of form and Calais are not very good. Though there was blood and guts and yellow cards, there were few fluent moves nor chances. </p> <p>Gradually Calais tired and after 72 minutes Sedan scored again. A misunderstanding in the Calais defence allowed Cedric Janeau to appear in front of the Calais keeper Cedric Schille, and when they both fell over after a lawless tussle, Pius Sielenu N'Diefu drove into an empty net. In the 85th minute N'Diefu broke through the Calais defence at pace, edged the ball to Mionnet, who hit the post, and from the rebound Quint tapped in his second. </p> <p>The upshot was that the little guys won. Sedan is a depressed Ardennes town a quarter the size of Calais and the club's rise from the French third division to fourth place in the Championnat is at least as remarkable as Calais' feat of last year. </p> <p>Calais won't be too upset. Their coach Ladislao Lozano, says the main thing this season is to get out of the fourth division. They are currently lying top.</p>",

Nico Thiriot, a wine buyer for Sainsbury's in England, son of the Calais managing director Claude Thiriot, raged: 'He's got a little brain, unfortunately'. Orient have offered to resolve the disputes by playing a friendly against Calais, but as Claude Thiriot noted: 'The whole world wants to play against us....' Calais, playing in baggy red-and-yellow shirts reminiscent of long ago, certainly seemed to miss Vasseur. They tackled vigorously, but had trouble controlling the ball, which kept bouncing off the wrong bits of their bodies. Sedan went ahead after 14 minutes. Moussa N'Diaye broke down the right, his cross beat the Calais defence, and Olivier Quint finished cleanly. At times Quint showed there is a difference between divisions, playing accurately at pace and creating several chances from the left wing. It's a shame that being a star in the French league nowadays means you have barely a chance of making the national team. For much of the first half Sedan played with Calais. Then Calais scored out of nothing. On 41 minutes, they were granted a mysterious free-kick to the right of the Sedan penalty area. The ball was lifted across, there was a tangle of bodies, a couple of players fell over, and suddenly the referee was pointing to the spot. The crowd roared, partly in disbelief. This was perhaps a compensation for the penalty that cost them the Cup last May. Reginald Becque placed the spot kick high in the side netting. It was the sort of Somme evening that made you understand why First World War memoirs were so obsessed with the weather. It was so cold that every toe hurt, and in the second half the air grew white with freezing mist. The match - the context aside - was depressing. Sedan are out of form and Calais are not very good. Though there was blood and guts and yellow cards, there were few fluent moves nor chances. Gradually Calais tired and after 72 minutes Sedan scored again. A misunderstanding in the Calais defence allowed Cedric Janeau to appear in front of the Calais keeper Cedric Schille, and when they both fell over after a lawless tussle, Pius Sielenu N'Diefu drove into an empty net. In the 85th minute N'Diefu broke through the Calais defence at pace, edged the ball to Mionnet, who hit the post, and from the rebound Quint tapped in his second. The upshot was that the little guys won. Sedan is a depressed Ardennes town a quarter the size of Calais and the club's rise from the French third division to fourth place in the Championnat is at least as remarkable as Calais' feat of last year. Calais won't be too upset. Their coach Ladislao Lozano, says the main thing this season is to get out of the fourth division. They are currently lying top.",

      "trailText": "<p>Deborah Warner is no stranger to bathing English theatre in the blood of the Greeks. But returning with a modern Medea, played by longtime collaborator Fiona Shaw, audiences are swooning in the aisles</p>",
      "byline": "Kate Kellaway",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>More than a decade ago ago, I met Deborah Warner in Paris. She was 29. She was already celebrated for her splendidly gruesome production of Titus Andronicus for the RSC and was directing Fiona Shaw in Sophocles's Electra. It was the first time the two women had worked together. Warner told me then that she was in the grip of 'total obsession'. The production was wonderful: Shaw turned sorrow into a character; she brought Greek tragedy almost too close for comfort. What neither woman could have known then was that Electra also marked the beginning of a remarkable theatrical collaboration and friendship. Warner seemed aware, at that time, only that the intensity of her working life might prove unsustainable: 'I may surprise everyone one day and stop,' she told me. </p> <p>It is an icy Friday night and we are having dinner in a London restaurant. It seems as though Fortune's wheel has come full circle: Warner and Shaw are at work on another Greek tragedy, Medea by Euripides. Yet from the way Warner talks, it seems that there is something valedictory in the air. The production began in Dublin last summer. When she first took it on, after nearly five years of work that was not 'text-based', she felt 'not high pleasure but dread. It was not a celebratory moment. I had thought I'd never revisit the Greeks'. She did not want to repeat herself and yet was conscious that this was a bad starting point for a piece of work. She wondered: 'What will happen if Medea needs the same vocabulary [as Electra]?' </p> <p>Everything seemed to be 'spinning out of control'. They had worked on Ibsen (Shaw was Hedda Gabler), Brecht, Shakespeare, Beckett and T.S. Eliot (their performance of The Waste Land travelled the world). Perhaps there was nothing more to add. 'Fiona and I were afraid the fluency had gone. We were fearful that we had lost something. It wasn't obvious where to go next and we were both a little sad.' And in rehearsal, unusually, Warner found herself at a loss. 'I did not trust what bubbled up to the surface. It was so provocative and outrageous that I thought: this cannot be true. And I ignored it. But it was the heart of the thing.' </p> <p>She has since had the strongest reassurance from Irish audiences and critics who have found nothing meretricious in her production. Now she is in rehearsal again, with a slightly different cast. Jonathan Cake (most recently seen as the romantic lead in Tennessee Williams's Baby Doll) plays Jason. She has come to trust Shaw's modern Medea who is, if reviewers have it right, frighteningly believable in her little black dress and who even, occasionally, elicits a laugh from audiences. But at the end, some people in the audience have swooned - one or two have even been sick - as Medea kills her little boys, to punish her faithless husband. </p> <p>Deborah Warner does not look like a person drawn to the cruel verge of human experience. She is tall, elegant, resolutely untheatrical (she wears no make-up) with a cap of fair hair. She reminds me of a calm hostess who is concerned for her guests and knows that, no matter how anarchic the occasion, order must have its place. (There is something maternal, in this, too.) She would laugh at this description - quick to see unintended irony in everything. </p> <p>She is far more interested in the work than in herself. She is less earnest than she used to be, more voluble and relaxed - if anything, less grown-up (a good thing). I scarcely know her but feel as though she is a friend. Is she still obsessive? 'Yes,' she laughs. I am struck by the way that she does not talk about 'directing' work; she uses, instead, the verb 'to make', as if pottery was her thing. It occurs to me that if I were to choose a single image for her, it would be earth. She is earth to Shaw's air, water and fire. She is the perfect foil to Shaw's volatile gifts. </p> <p>During rehearsal periods she describes herself as 'blinkered' and 'utterly unable to do anything else'. She expects absolute commitment from actors, too. 'You can choose to create conditions in which there is no world outside the rehearsal room. Players who have a foot somewhere else are not that serious.' But she reminds me, reasonably, that that this is not such a big deal: rehearsals do not go on forever. </p> <p>The difficulty of Medea is partly that it is 'very, very old' and that 2,500 years later, 'there is a complex screen between us and the play'. And yet she sticks her neck out to say that Medea is more relevant to us than the work of most contemporary playwrights. She was never sickened herself by the material, but is fascinated by people who faint on seeing her production. She surprises me by suggesting that it shows a profound identification with the material. 'We'd really like to know why they faint,' she says with a twinkle in her eye. </p> <p>The night we meet, the story of Anna Climbie, abused and murdered by her aunt, has just broken. Warner has not had time to look at the newspapers but interrogates me, wants to know exactly how Anna was abused, why she died. I fudge the details. Her clear brown eyes look back at me questioningly. There is no sensational curiosity here, but she wants to know everything. Later, she identifies in our society a 'neurotic inability to look at the things that horrify' and I feel slightly chastened. </p> <p>All Warner's work is about observation and understanding. It is about seeing more, seeing differently, never looking the away. She praises Shaw for making us 'understand the act' of killing your children. Do Warner and Shaw aspire to professional impersonality at the start of each new production? They are 'very close' and have a 'shorthand' but are watchful in order that the rest of the cast should not feel snubbed. Is the hope that, with each new role, Warner will help Shaw extend her range as an actress? 'Completely.' They always work within a text. Warner sees her 'greatest weakness' as being unable to stand back. It is only through rehearsal that she makes her discoveries. She is 'very slow'. </p> <p>She is feted here - but we probably can't compete with the French, who adore her. She has been awarded, to her great delight, with the Chevalier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres. She cherishes the greenish-silver medal. (She jokily regards it as 'a bit of a cheek' that Shaw - who this month got a CBE - has recently bagged one too.) Is she, perhaps, a Frenchwoman in disguise? Not at all, she laughs. She does not - 'disgracefully' - even speak French. She praises the French for their loyalty to their prot\u00e9g\u00e9s (she mentions Robert Wilson, Peter Sellars). What is it the French like about her? She protests that their affection remains a mystery. I have to answer my own question: the French champion original work. </p> <p>She fears that theatre in this country is definitely 'on the decline' and describes it as 'heartbreaking'. Theatre is a poor relation to film, she believes, and bewails the loss of some of our best actors to the screen. 'Pay structures are part of it,' she sighs. If there is one thing she minds as a theatre director, it is that 'you can't guarantee that you'll get a first-class supporting cast. I think the National's difficulties are not unconnected to getting the casting right.' </p> <p>Wherever she chooses to work, Warner has been a genius of place. Buildings inspire her. I was especially thrilled by the poetic work she did in London's almost derelict Midland Grand Hotel, St Pancras. She took it on rather as one might a neglected author. She haunted the hotel, filling it with fugitive maids and birds. (She also champions neglected authors. She has recently made a fine film of Elizabeth Bowen's novel The Last September.) </p> <p>She also moved temporarily into the Euston Tower's upper floors where audiences of one could explore offices in which a fax might spew out out Paradise Lost or a solitary bird might sing. And at the top of the building, there was a sighting of angels: an urban annunciation. </p> <p>If she could alight on a building now, which would she choose? 'The trouble is, I have moved on to cities,' she laughs. She took over Perth, in Australia, not long ago. 'I'd like New York or LA,' she adds (she is not timid). She is drawn, too, to the London Eye, feels sure she could 'make' something there. She would also like to do a piece of work based on a funfair, perhaps in Australia. But her next job is to direct Fidelio at Glyndebourne. She has a 'year of opera' ahead. </p> <p>She has done - made - so much. But at what personal cost? Does she regret, for example, not having children? She describes herself as a keen aunt, and explains that she loved working with children in The Turn of the Screw - she felt like 'the most privileged mother in the land'. But she would regret not having children greatly were it not for her work. And she describes her actors with something like family feeling. </p> <p>Last summer, it all became too much for her. She was 'exhausted'. At last, she did what she'd threatened to: she stopped. It was her mid-life crisis, she says. She went to Hydra in Greece (favoured by Leonard Cohen), where there are 'no cars - only donkeys' and she was - most of the time - on her own. This was a new experience. She stayed for seven weeks, swam every day, read 30 novels. She finds London too distracting for reading.

      "bodyText": "More than a decade ago ago, I met Deborah Warner in Paris. She was 29. She was already celebrated for her splendidly gruesome production of Titus Andronicus for the RSC and was directing Fiona Shaw in Sophocles's Electra. It was the first time the two women had worked together. Warner told me then that she was in the grip of 'total obsession'. The production was wonderful: Shaw turned sorrow into a character; she brought Greek tragedy almost too close for comfort. What neither woman could have known then was that Electra also marked the beginning of a remarkable theatrical collaboration and friendship. Warner seemed aware, at that time, only that the intensity of her working life might prove unsustainable: 'I may surprise everyone one day and stop,' she told me. It is an icy Friday night and we are having dinner in a London restaurant. It seems as though Fortune's wheel has come full circle: Warner and Shaw are at work on another Greek tragedy, Medea by Euripides. Yet from the way Warner talks, it seems that there is something valedictory in the air. The production began in Dublin last summer. When she first took it on, after nearly five years of work that was not 'text-based', she felt 'not high pleasure but dread. It was not a celebratory moment. I had thought I'd never revisit the Greeks'. She did not want to repeat herself and yet was conscious that this was a bad starting point for a piece of work. She wondered: 'What will happen if Medea needs the same vocabulary [as Electra]?' Everything seemed to be 'spinning out of control'. They had worked on Ibsen (Shaw was Hedda Gabler), Brecht, Shakespeare, Beckett and T.S. Eliot (their performance of The Waste Land travelled the world). Perhaps there was nothing more to add. 'Fiona and I were afraid the fluency had gone. We were fearful that we had lost something. It wasn't obvious where to go next and we were both a little sad.' And in rehearsal, unusually, Warner found herself at a loss. 'I did not trust what bubbled up to the surface. It was so provocative and outrageous that I thought: this cannot be true. And I ignored it. But it was the heart of the thing.' She has since had the strongest reassurance from Irish audiences and critics who have found nothing meretricious in her production. Now she is in rehearsal again, with a slightly different cast. Jonathan Cake (most recently seen as the romantic lead in Tennessee Williams's Baby Doll) plays Jason. She has come to trust Shaw's modern Medea who is, if reviewers have it right, frighteningly believable in her little black dress and who even, occasionally, elicits a laugh from audiences. But at the end, some people in the audience have swooned - one or two have even been sick - as Medea kills her little boys, to punish her faithless husband. Deborah Warner does not look like a person drawn to the cruel verge of human experience. She is tall, elegant, resolutely untheatrical (she wears no make-up) with a cap of fair hair. She reminds me of a calm hostess who is concerned for her guests and knows that, no matter how anarchic the occasion, order must have its place. (There is something maternal, in this, too.) She would laugh at this description - quick to see unintended irony in everything. She is far more interested in the work than in herself. She is less earnest than she used to be, more voluble and relaxed - if anything, less grown-up (a good thing). I scarcely know her but feel as though she is a friend. Is she still obsessive? 'Yes,' she laughs. I am struck by the way that she does not talk about 'directing' work; she uses, instead, the verb 'to make', as if pottery was her thing. It occurs to me that if I were to choose a single image for her, it would be earth. She is earth to Shaw's air, water and fire. She is the perfect foil to Shaw's volatile gifts. During rehearsal periods she describes herself as 'blinkered' and 'utterly unable to do anything else'. She expects absolute commitment from actors, too. 'You can choose to create conditions in which there is no world outside the rehearsal room. Players who have a foot somewhere else are not that serious.' But she reminds me, reasonably, that that this is not such a big deal: rehearsals do not go on forever. The difficulty of Medea is partly that it is 'very, very old' and that 2,500 years later, 'there is a complex screen between us and the play'. And yet she sticks her neck out to say that Medea is more relevant to us than the work of most contemporary playwrights. She was never sickened herself by the material, but is fascinated by people who faint on seeing her production. She surprises me by suggesting that it shows a profound identification with the material. 'We'd really like to know why they faint,' she says with a twinkle in her eye. The night we meet, the story of Anna Climbie, abused and murdered by her aunt, has just broken. Warner has not had time to look at the newspapers but interrogates me, wants to know exactly how Anna was abused, why she died. I fudge the details. Her clear brown eyes look back at me questioningly. There is no sensational curiosity here, but she wants to know everything. Later, she identifies in our society a 'neurotic inability to look at the things that horrify' and I feel slightly chastened. All Warner's work is about observation and understanding. It is about seeing more, seeing differently, never looking the away. She praises Shaw for making us 'understand the act' of killing your children. Do Warner and Shaw aspire to professional impersonality at the start of each new production? They are 'very close' and have a 'shorthand' but are watchful in order that the rest of the cast should not feel snubbed. Is the hope that, with each new role, Warner will help Shaw extend her range as an actress? 'Completely.' They always work within a text. Warner sees her 'greatest weakness' as being unable to stand back. It is only through rehearsal that she makes her discoveries. She is 'very slow'. She is feted here - but we probably can't compete with the French, who adore her. She has been awarded, to her great delight, with the Chevalier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres. She cherishes the greenish-silver medal. (She jokily regards it as 'a bit of a cheek' that Shaw - who this month got a CBE - has recently bagged one too.) Is she, perhaps, a Frenchwoman in disguise? Not at all, she laughs. She does not - 'disgracefully' - even speak French. She praises the French for their loyalty to their prot\u00e9g\u00e9s (she mentions Robert Wilson, Peter Sellars). What is it the French like about her? She protests that their affection remains a mystery. I have to answer my own question: the French champion original work. She fears that theatre in this country is definitely 'on the decline' and describes it as 'heartbreaking'. Theatre is a poor relation to film, she believes, and bewails the loss of some of our best actors to the screen. 'Pay structures are part of it,' she sighs. If there is one thing she minds as a theatre director, it is that 'you can't guarantee that you'll get a first-class supporting cast. I think the National's difficulties are not unconnected to getting the casting right.' Wherever she chooses to work, Warner has been a genius of place. Buildings inspire her. I was especially thrilled by the poetic work she did in London's almost derelict Midland Grand Hotel, St Pancras. She took it on rather as one might a neglected author. She haunted the hotel, filling it with fugitive maids and birds. (She also champions neglected authors. She has recently made a fine film of Elizabeth Bowen's novel The Last September.) She also moved temporarily into the Euston Tower's upper floors where audiences of one could explore offices in which a fax might spew out out Paradise Lost or a solitary bird might sing. And at the top of the building, there was a sighting of angels: an urban annunciation. If she could alight on a building now, which would she choose? 'The trouble is, I have moved on to cities,' she laughs. She took over Perth, in Australia, not long ago. 'I'd like New York or LA,' she adds (she is not timid). She is drawn, too, to the London Eye, feels sure she could 'make' something there. She would also like to do a piece of work based on a funfair, perhaps in Australia. But her next job is to direct Fidelio at Glyndebourne. She has a 'year of opera' ahead. She has done - made - so much. But at what personal cost? Does she regret, for example, not having children? She describes herself as a keen aunt, and explains that she loved working with children in The Turn of the Screw - she felt like 'the most privileged mother in the land'. But she would regret not having children greatly were it not for her work. And she describes her actors with something like family feeling. Last summer, it all became too much for her. She was 'exhausted'. At last, she did what she'd threatened to: she stopped. It was her mid-life crisis, she says. She went to Hydra in Greece (favoured by Leonard Cohen), where there are 'no cars - only donkeys' and she was - most of the time - on her own. This was a new experience. She stayed for seven weeks, swam every day, read 30 novels. She finds London too distracting for reading. 'It is exciting - but we are having a bit of a party here, aren't we?' she says, with her best hostess smile.

It was from his pass spread wide that Silvinho crossed and Robert Pires, a shadow of the dynamic figure of autumn, shot goalwards - Thierry Henry seeing his touch kicked away by Royce, who also beat away shots by Ray Parlour and Pires moments later. Henry also clipped the outside of a post from Parlour's low shot. His tame late shot straight at Royce ultimately summed up Arsenal's finishing, however. Leicester's only real chance came when Sturridge looked to latch on to a clearance, only to be dragged back by Silvinho on the halfway line. Even if Lee Dixon was covering, it should have been a red card for plain old-fashioned cheating. The home side's enduring spirit in adversity - they also lost Muzzy Izzet with a neck injury - was commendable but class should still have prevailed. The consolation for Arsenal was that captain Tony Adams came through unscathed after a three-match absence. If they are to halt a decline that has seen them take only three points in four matches, they will need his traditional banging of heads together.",

To all intents and purposes nothing happened in a featureless first half. Ryan Giggs was United's liveliest attacker without ever managing to deliver the telling final pass, while David James made a sharp early save from Ole Gunnar Solskjaer before demonstrating that Dracula jokes are not wholly unfounded - punching his first corner unconvincingly and scrambling a save from Teddy Sheringham after failing to cut out Giggs's cross. </p> <p>That was the best chance of the first half until Greening shot over on the stroke of the interval. Villa, apart from one hopeful drive from Paul Merson, hardly bothered Fabien Barthez at all. The visitors gave the promised debut to \u00a39.5 million Colombian Juan Pablo Angel, who predictably looked cold and out of touch despite showing one or two deft touches. Angel will need time, of course, but it is already being unkindly suggested that Villa already have David Ginola performing that function. </p> <p>Unsurprisingly, the Frenchman was another absentee at the start. Those who interpreted John Gregory's comments last week as a thinly disguised hint to pack his bags must have been mildly astonished to see Ginola on the bench, although to judge by the kids and reserves keeping him company in the dug-out, Villa's player shortage has not been exaggerated. If Ginola is coming towards the end of his brief Villa career, however, it begs the question of why he was bought in the first place. As Duncan McKenzie said all those years ago: 'I can't understand why managers buy airy-fairy players like me then try to turn them into runners. If they want a runner, why don't they just sign David Bedford?' </p> <p>Mercifully, the game showed signs of life after the interval. Perhaps realising United might be there for the taking, Villa came out looking for a goal and almost had one when Angel's dangerous cross caught Dion Dublin in two minds: lay off or shoot? Then a superb ball from Merson played Hendrie behind a square United defence but, while admiring the lightning reactions from Barthez in closing down the youngster, Villa really should have taken the lead. They were unlucky not to in their next attack when Greening had to clear off the line from the impressive Gareth Barry, but there was a certain inevitability about the rest of the game as Villa accepted they were unlikely to get a better opportunity. </p> <p>Only James offered resistance, making a commendable triple save from Sheringham, Roy Keane and then Solskjaer, which must have impressed Eriksson. James was much less happy a minute later, unsighted by one of his own defenders as Gary Neville touched Keane's free kick past him at the near post for only the third goal of his career. Also unhappy was Hendrie, who claimed he had merely stood his ground when Keane ran into him for the initial free-kick. </p> <p>Unhappiest of all, though, must have been Ginola, who was given just seven minutes to roll his sleeves up, enough time only to give Denis Irwin a glare for a heavy challenge, send a left-wing cross out of play, and watch Sheringham complete a one-two with Andy Cole to set the seal on United's win with his eighteenth goal of the season. An all-English one too, and Eriksson confirmed that in-form thirtysomethings would be considered for his first England squad. 'I'm not surprised, Teddy has been phenomenal this season,' Ferguson said. Although 14 points clear, United are still hungry, and it was a somewhat glum Ferguson who revealed his players had even declined a night out on last week's training break in favour of staying in the hotel and 'focusing'. On the Champions League, presumably. For the rest of the Premiership can be located through the wrong end of a telescope.</p>",

The Italian Chelsea manager steered his side to their sixth successive game without defeat after Ipswich had threatened to continue over-achieving before ultimately finding their level. </p> <p>Ipswich remain in the Premiership top six and have accomplished their survival mission months ahead of schedule, but Chelsea move up to eighth and are increasingly looking a better bet to finish in a European qualifying place come May. </p> <p>Ipswich initially defied Chelsea's formidable home form, nine wins in 10 games now, by starting the better side and were good for their 22nd-minute lead when Marcus Stewart extended his scoring run to seven matches with his 17th goal of the season. James Scowcroft won a tackle with Celestine Babayaro and the ball broke kindly for Stewart to win the race and poke a shot over the despairing Carlo Cudicini. </p> <p>The Chelsea keeper would not be so exposed for the rest of the game, but Chelsea were were still far from convincing until they equalised through the outstanding Gus Poyet in the 45th minute. A Dennis Wise corner was headed by John Terry and cleared off the line by Gary Croft only to fall straight to Poyet, who scored with power from six yards out. </p> <p>That changed the course of the game and Ranieri, who had left out Frank Leboeuf ahead of his imminent transfer to Monaco, seemingly further boosted Chelsea's confidence with a trademark shuffle of his pawns for the start of the second half, abandoning his 4-4-2 formation by replacing Eidur Gudjohnsen for Mario Melchiot. </p> <p>Ipswich continued to press forward but looked increasingly out of sorts and it was all but checkmate 12 minutes after the restart. </p> <p>Chelsea had been dominant from the outset and Wise gave Chelsea the lead, scoring from a well-worked Hasselbaink cross. </p> <p>Hasselbaink helped end the game as a contest when he laid on Chelsea's third goal for Poyet in the 65th minute. The Dutch striker carried the ball from the half-way line and waited for Poyet to arrive in the penalty area to pass into his stride for a sliding finish from 10 yards. </p> <p>Finally, the pasta boys were outsinging the tractor boys as Chelsea pursued more glory. It came in the form of a 73rd-minute Hasselbaink penalty, drilled into the middle of the net, three minutes after referee Andy D'Urso had surprisingly decided Fabian Wilnis had fouled Sam Dalla Bona and then sent off the Ipswich defender John McGreal for disputing the call. </p> <p>The Ipswich manager, George Burley, also disagreed with D'Urso and accused him of affecting the scoreline but Poyet, representing Ranieri, rightly pointed out that the game was well won by then.</p>",

Ipswich remain in the Premiership top six and have accomplished their survival mission months ahead of schedule, but Chelsea move up to eighth and are increasingly looking a better bet to finish in a European qualifying place come May. Ipswich initially defied Chelsea's formidable home form, nine wins in 10 games now, by starting the better side and were good for their 22nd-minute lead when Marcus Stewart extended his scoring run to seven matches with his 17th goal of the season. James Scowcroft won a tackle with Celestine Babayaro and the ball broke kindly for Stewart to win the race and poke a shot over the despairing Carlo Cudicini. The Chelsea keeper would not be so exposed for the rest of the game, but Chelsea were were still far from convincing until they equalised through the outstanding Gus Poyet in the 45th minute. A Dennis Wise corner was headed by John Terry and cleared off the line by Gary Croft only to fall straight to Poyet, who scored with power from six yards out. That changed the course of the game and Ranieri, who had left out Frank Leboeuf ahead of his imminent transfer to Monaco, seemingly further boosted Chelsea's confidence with a trademark shuffle of his pawns for the start of the second half, abandoning his 4-4-2 formation by replacing Eidur Gudjohnsen for Mario Melchiot. Ipswich continued to press forward but looked increasingly out of sorts and it was all but checkmate 12 minutes after the restart. Chelsea had been dominant from the outset and Wise gave Chelsea the lead, scoring from a well-worked Hasselbaink cross. Hasselbaink helped end the game as a contest when he laid on Chelsea's third goal for Poyet in the 65th minute. The Dutch striker carried the ball from the half-way line and waited for Poyet to arrive in the penalty area to pass into his stride for a sliding finish from 10 yards. Finally, the pasta boys were outsinging the tractor boys as Chelsea pursued more glory. It came in the form of a 73rd-minute Hasselbaink penalty, drilled into the middle of the net, three minutes after referee Andy D'Urso had surprisingly decided Fabian Wilnis had fouled Sam Dalla Bona and then sent off the Ipswich defender John McGreal for disputing the call. The Ipswich manager, George Burley, also disagreed with D'Urso and accused him of affecting the scoreline but Poyet, representing Ranieri, rightly pointed out that the game was well won by then.",

      "byline": "Paul Wilson",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Matt Jansen's season was going nowhere in particular until the last time Blackburn Rovers played Birmingham City, when he came off the bench and scored a couple of spectacular goals to earn a win and book himself a run in the team. Graeme Souness still reckons the 23-year-old is inconsistent, but Jansen argues, as politely as he dares, that 12 goals in his last 15 starts is consistent enough for most people. 'I'm not saying I can't improve,' he said. 'But I'm fairly happy with my form. I think I'm benefiting from the stability the manager has brought. The whole club is. I've only been here two years and I'm on my third manager. After Brian Kidd and Tony Parkes I think there was a need to impose some managerial consistency, and that's what Graeme Souness has done.' </p> <p>Not many young footballers place such a high value on managerial continuity, but having served his apprenticeship at Carlisle United and Crystal Palace, you can understand Jansen's desire to check the same name is on the manager's office from week to week. </p> <p>'Palace wasn't too bad, to be fair,' he said. 'Ron Noades was still around, Steve Coppell was manager, and I enjoyed my time there. Carlisle was a much crazier place. I was actually managed by Michael Knighton for a while. He certainly has some interesting ideas. I was amused by the bloke who rolled up in a battered old Cavalier to try and buy the club last week, but ultimately there's nothing particularly funny about being bottom of the League. I'm from Carlisle, even if I do support Newcastle, and I know the club should be doing better than that.' </p> <p>Jansen's ties to Tyneside first came to light four years ago, when, after extensive scouting, Kenny Dalglish declined to make Carlisle an offer for their promising teenage striker, opting instead to bring another foreigner to St James' Park at five or six times the price. Dalglish was criticised for neglecting talent on his own doorstep, and a disappointed Jansen famously said he would have walked to Newcastle for the chance to play for the Magpies. 'I was disappointed, but I didn't get too despondent because I didn't know too much about what was going on,' he said. 'I heard the talk, but I wasn't kept informed.' </p> <p>If Jansen still harbours a desire to play for the team he supported as a boy, he keeps it fairly well hidden. When he signed for Palace and Blackburn they were both Premiership clubs, and his only ambition at the moment is to return to the top flight. 'This club is geared up for Premiership football, nothing else will do, and I feel the same way,' he said. 'I do have one or two other ambitions, as a matter of fact. I'd like to play for England and I'd like to try playing abroad for a while, but returning to the Premiership is a necessary first step.' </p> <p>Which brings us neatly to Birmingham this afternoon, and the first hurdle of a six-week programme that Souness reckons will determine the shape of Blackburn's season. 'Within the next month-and-a-half we are away to Birmingham, Bolton and Watford, and at home to Fulham and Sheffield United,' Souness said. 'We should know by the end of all that whether we are on course for automatic promotion or whether we will be looking at the play-offs.' </p> <p>If it is to be automatic promotion, Souness is realistic enough to accept that only one place is likely to be available - the one behind Fulham. 'I keep waiting to see if they wobble or hit a bad patch, because most teams do some time, but they aren't making many mistakes at the moment,' he said. </p> <p>Blackburn are well-placed to time a run, however, and with Jansen reunited with former Palace team-mate Marcus Bent, Mark Hughes around for experience and Nathan Blake almost back to full fitness, goalscoring should not be a problem. </p> <p>On the delicate side for a striker at 10st 13lb, Jansen was predictably awestruck by close proximity to the 37-year-old manager of Wales. 'I can't believe the way he puts himself about, throwing defenders around the place,' Jansen said. 'I hope I can do all the things he can do when I'm his age. Not throwing defenders around, I don't think I'll be doing that no matter how old I get, but the amazing thing about Mark is how passionate he still is, how fired-up he gets for a game.' </p> <p>The scorer of five goals since his free transfer from Everton in October is suspended this afternoon, a result of getting a little too fired-up at Norwich, but Hughes has seen enough of Jansen in action to form a positive opinion. 'Matt's a great talent, and everybody in football knows his potential,' he said. 'He burst onto the scene a couple of years ago and possibly found the expectations people had of him hard to deal with. He has improved under Graeme Souness, though, and his form this season has been sensational. He looks every inch a Premiership player.' </p> <p>Just as well, since the last recorded wish of the late Jack Walker was that he wanted Rovers back in the top division, whatever it might take. It is 10 years to the week since football's most generous benefactor first became officially involved with Blackburn, a point in history at which Kenny Dalglish, Alan Shearer, the Premiership title and a totally transformed Ewood were undreamt of (except perhaps by Walker). But since his death last summer uncertainty has arisen over the ongoing funding of the club. </p> <p>Walker always intended the club to stand on its own feet once established in the Premiership, even if that proved more difficult than he imagined, but speculation that he left a finite amount of money sufficient to finance only one or two further promotion bids has been denied by Paul Egerton-Vernon, the Jersey solicitor who is the chairman of the holding company to which Walker's Blackburn shares have passed. </p> <p>'There is no diminishing pot where the amount gets smaller as the years go by,' Egerton-Vernon said. 'The football club is one of a number of businesses that Jack Walker acquired, and funds are generated by the success or otherwise of the other business interests he put in place.' </p> <p>With Walker no longer around, though, Rovers' maverick days may be over. An AGM this week will be presented with plans to turn Walker's loans to the club into shares - a move that executives insist will improve long-term funding - and Rovers may be floated in the near future.

      "bodyText": "Matt Jansen's season was going nowhere in particular until the last time Blackburn Rovers played Birmingham City, when he came off the bench and scored a couple of spectacular goals to earn a win and book himself a run in the team. Graeme Souness still reckons the 23-year-old is inconsistent, but Jansen argues, as politely as he dares, that 12 goals in his last 15 starts is consistent enough for most people. 'I'm not saying I can't improve,' he said. 'But I'm fairly happy with my form. I think I'm benefiting from the stability the manager has brought. The whole club is. I've only been here two years and I'm on my third manager. After Brian Kidd and Tony Parkes I think there was a need to impose some managerial consistency, and that's what Graeme Souness has done.' Not many young footballers place such a high value on managerial continuity, but having served his apprenticeship at Carlisle United and Crystal Palace, you can understand Jansen's desire to check the same name is on the manager's office from week to week. 'Palace wasn't too bad, to be fair,' he said. 'Ron Noades was still around, Steve Coppell was manager, and I enjoyed my time there. Carlisle was a much crazier place. I was actually managed by Michael Knighton for a while. He certainly has some interesting ideas. I was amused by the bloke who rolled up in a battered old Cavalier to try and buy the club last week, but ultimately there's nothing particularly funny about being bottom of the League. I'm from Carlisle, even if I do support Newcastle, and I know the club should be doing better than that.' Jansen's ties to Tyneside first came to light four years ago, when, after extensive scouting, Kenny Dalglish declined to make Carlisle an offer for their promising teenage striker, opting instead to bring another foreigner to St James' Park at five or six times the price. Dalglish was criticised for neglecting talent on his own doorstep, and a disappointed Jansen famously said he would have walked to Newcastle for the chance to play for the Magpies. 'I was disappointed, but I didn't get too despondent because I didn't know too much about what was going on,' he said. 'I heard the talk, but I wasn't kept informed.' If Jansen still harbours a desire to play for the team he supported as a boy, he keeps it fairly well hidden. When he signed for Palace and Blackburn they were both Premiership clubs, and his only ambition at the moment is to return to the top flight. 'This club is geared up for Premiership football, nothing else will do, and I feel the same way,' he said. 'I do have one or two other ambitions, as a matter of fact. I'd like to play for England and I'd like to try playing abroad for a while, but returning to the Premiership is a necessary first step.' Which brings us neatly to Birmingham this afternoon, and the first hurdle of a six-week programme that Souness reckons will determine the shape of Blackburn's season. 'Within the next month-and-a-half we are away to Birmingham, Bolton and Watford, and at home to Fulham and Sheffield United,' Souness said. 'We should know by the end of all that whether we are on course for automatic promotion or whether we will be looking at the play-offs.' If it is to be automatic promotion, Souness is realistic enough to accept that only one place is likely to be available - the one behind Fulham. 'I keep waiting to see if they wobble or hit a bad patch, because most teams do some time, but they aren't making many mistakes at the moment,' he said. Blackburn are well-placed to time a run, however, and with Jansen reunited with former Palace team-mate Marcus Bent, Mark Hughes around for experience and Nathan Blake almost back to full fitness, goalscoring should not be a problem. On the delicate side for a striker at 10st 13lb, Jansen was predictably awestruck by close proximity to the 37-year-old manager of Wales. 'I can't believe the way he puts himself about, throwing defenders around the place,' Jansen said. 'I hope I can do all the things he can do when I'm his age. Not throwing defenders around, I don't think I'll be doing that no matter how old I get, but the amazing thing about Mark is how passionate he still is, how fired-up he gets for a game.' The scorer of five goals since his free transfer from Everton in October is suspended this afternoon, a result of getting a little too fired-up at Norwich, but Hughes has seen enough of Jansen in action to form a positive opinion. 'Matt's a great talent, and everybody in football knows his potential,' he said. 'He burst onto the scene a couple of years ago and possibly found the expectations people had of him hard to deal with. He has improved under Graeme Souness, though, and his form this season has been sensational. He looks every inch a Premiership player.' Just as well, since the last recorded wish of the late Jack Walker was that he wanted Rovers back in the top division, whatever it might take. It is 10 years to the week since football's most generous benefactor first became officially involved with Blackburn, a point in history at which Kenny Dalglish, Alan Shearer, the Premiership title and a totally transformed Ewood were undreamt of (except perhaps by Walker). But since his death last summer uncertainty has arisen over the ongoing funding of the club. Walker always intended the club to stand on its own feet once established in the Premiership, even if that proved more difficult than he imagined, but speculation that he left a finite amount of money sufficient to finance only one or two further promotion bids has been denied by Paul Egerton-Vernon, the Jersey solicitor who is the chairman of the holding company to which Walker's Blackburn shares have passed. 'There is no diminishing pot where the amount gets smaller as the years go by,' Egerton-Vernon said. 'The football club is one of a number of businesses that Jack Walker acquired, and funds are generated by the success or otherwise of the other business interests he put in place.' With Walker no longer around, though, Rovers' maverick days may be over. An AGM this week will be presented with plans to turn Walker's loans to the club into shares - a move that executives insist will improve long-term funding - and Rovers may be floated in the near future. 'Our priority is getting back into the Premiership, and then we'll see whether a flotation makes sense,' Egerton-Vernon said. 'But we don't need to float, that's the wonderful thing. The reason to seek a listing would not be because we can't afford to run the club, because we can. Jack Walker made arrangements to ensure that was the case.'",

      "body": "<p>Charlton Athletic are sitting comfortably in the top half of the Premiership, turning away several thousand punters a week because the ground is full to bursting, and oozing optimism. As Alan Curbishley drove into work his mind raced with questions: 'We're into the second half of the season and I was thinking what can we do now? What do we need? What will give us a lift?' All his thoughts stem from one goal. Staying up. So he challenges himself, analysing the details, searching for the nuggets that will ensure Premiership status. </p> <p>Curbishley's approach has won him admiration enough to put him in the frame for Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson's new England regime and he has emerged as a potential successor to Sir Alex Ferguson at Old Trafford. It has also kept him in his post at Charlton for a decade - which makes him the second-longest-serving manager in the Premiership after that peerless trophy gatherer in Manchester. Not bad going for a young man who figured, when accepting the post in 1991, that his first job would probably be his last. Most managers starting out are well aware that if they flounder at the first attempt they are unlikely to get a second go, and the Charlton that he took on 10 years ago were, in his own words, in absolute turmoil. The chances of success were wafer thin. </p> <p>Sitting in his bright office overlooking the training pitch he casts his mind back to the day he was appointed. His predecessor, Lennie Lawrence, had upped sticks for Middlesbrough, leaving Curbishley and Steve Gritt, both player-coaches at the time, feeling obliged to apply for the job. 'We had no ground, no players and no money. We were just on the floor. Myself and Gritty were sitting in here, I looked out to see the 14 senior players walking out to start pre-season, and I said to Gritty: \"I just can't imagine anybody coming in and taking this job.\" The club decided to give it to us two. I don't think they could have done anything else. We felt a bit like lambs to the slaughter but you have to take the chance when it comes along. I wouldn't swap it because the experiences hold you in good stead.' </p> <p>Charlton were homeless (having quit renting at Selhurst Park and still weeding the terraces at the dilapidated Valley, they played at Upton Park in front of 3,500). They were also skint. 'Those days we couldn't order boots from people on the phone because we hadn't paid the bills and had to send them cash, and we couldn't stay in hotels we had previously been to in case we hadn't settled the bill. The whole thing was on the verge of collapse. If we'd have been relegated that year, which was on the cards...' Curbishley pauses, and chooses his words carefully, 'I think I can say we might not be here. In the end we came seventh and it took off from there. I still maintain out of the last 10 years that the first year at Upton Park was the most important.' </p> <p>It speaks volumes for their progress that Charlton are now planning for the next 10 years. Says Curbishley: 'The biggest step for this club is to increase the size of the ground, that's our next major priority. The chairman is desperate to do that. We've got planning permission for behind one goal but we really need permission for behind the other goal as well, then we can wrap it around and get a 34,000 all-seater. When the chairman first got involved we were looking to become a QPR or Norwich, with the ability to challenge for a place in the top flight. Now our aim is to become a club able to compete with West Ham in this area. If you come back in two years' time, hopefully we'll still be a Premiership club, the ground will be done, and we'll be on our way.' </p> <p>He is under no illusions that the catalyst to turn their dreams into reality is survival. Key discussions on stadium development are due in the summer. A bumper pay day from the new television deal, coupled with confidence that they are capable of avoiding the yo-yo that afflicts so many promoted clubs, may well give them the urge to go for it. </p> <p>The other day, when last week's FA Cup replay at Dagenham and Redbridge fell victim to the weather and football's heart went out to the non-leaguers, was poignant for Charlton's manager. In a cold snap \u00a3150,000 of television money disappeared into thin air. Nobody except Curbishley gave a moment's thought to the fact that Charlton, too, had lost out on a nice little earner. At that moment he was struck by a sudden realisation that Charlton were no longer perceived as cash-strapped strugglers with a touch of the underdogs about them. </p> <p>That humbling draw in the first game also made Curbishley recognise how much attitudes have changed. 'I saw the headlines and it really rammed it home to me that we are a Premiership club. I had letters from fans who have been supporting us for 50 years saying, \"Being a Charlton fan I have never been as embarrassed as I was after Dagenham when I had to go back and face my mates.\" I was embarrassed when I was trying to sign players and we had Portakabins and no ground. I was embarrassed when we were playing in front of 3,500 fans at Upton Park. I was embarrassed when I was having to sell my best players to pay the wages. That was embarrassing - not the result against Dagenham and Redbridge.' </p> <p>After 10 experience-packed years at Charlton Athletic, this job still has the capacity to surprise, to test and to push Alan Curbishley.</p>",

The tour operator is highlighting new routes in Switzerland and Austria which are good for families. The 11-night Austria itinerary - which is available from 7 July to the end of August - covers less than 100 miles on quiet routes, with 'non-cycling' days where families can enjoy excursions, mountain hikes or watersports. The cost for two adults and two children starts from \u00a32,717. </p> <p> <strong> 2 In the swim</strong> <br> Why take pot luck with the weather when you can guarantee a constant 84 degrees Fahrenheit in a Center Parcs 'Subtropical Swimming Paradise'? Each of the three resorts featured in <a href=\"http://www.europeanlife.co.uk\">SeaFrance</a>'s European Life brochure (08702 424455) has a gigantic, dome-covered pool area as its centrepiece. While children splash about in waterchutes and wave pools, parents can enjoy a relaxing spa treatment or a round of golf.

Some farms will let children help out with feeding the animals, collecting eggs and watching cows being milked. Prices for a family of four range from as little as \u00a3160 for a week's self-catering in low season, leading in at \u00a3490 in high season. </p> <p> <strong> 4 Dive, dive, dive</strong> <br> It's now easier than ever for parents to share the pleasures of diving with their children. The new 'SASY' (Supplied Air Snorkelling for Youth) system uses a miniature cylinder and flotation device designed to allow children from the age of five to dive in the safety of a pool. While children aged 10 and over can now take the PADI Junior Open Water Diver course which follows the same format as the adult course. Contact the diving specialist <a href=\"http://www.regal-diving.co.uk\">Regal Holidays</a> (0870 2201 777) for details of its family diving packages in the Red Sea. </p> <p> <strong> 5 Island life</strong> <br> Menorca's sandy beaches and shallow waters make it a popular family destination. Villa company Meon (01730 268411) has a good selection of beachside properties. Villa A2 Santo Tomas is a stone's throw from a long sandy beach on the south coast. It sleeps up to nine and has a 15-metre swimming pool and accommodation all on one level. Prices start from \u00a3395 per person in May rising to \u00a3689 per person between 30 July and 19 August, including flights and car hire. </p> <p> <strong> 6 High energy</strong> <br> Parascending, rafting, mountainbiking and surfing are just a few of the activities for teenagers being highlighted in <a href=\"http://www.keycamp.com\">Keycamp Holidays</a>' new minibrochure (0870 7000 123). Holiday prices start at \u00a3444 per family at Argel\u00e8s-sur-Mer in the Languedoc, inclusive of 12 nights' tent accommodation (\u00a3641 in a mobile home), ferry crossings and Children's Club, departing in May. Facilities include scuba-diving and kayaking lessons in the campsite pool and riding stables just outside the site. </p> <p> <strong> 7 On the road</strong> <br> Experience the freedom of the open road and spectacular scenery on a motorhome tour of western Canada. <a href=\"http://www.lakes-mountains.co.uk\">Lakes &amp; Mountains Holidays</a> (01329 844405) is offering 16-day touring holidays out of Vancouver or Calgary, departing any time in July. Motorhomes have all mod cons including air conditioning, shower, flush WC and fresh water tank and campsites are well-equipped. The cost of the holiday is \u00a3847 per adult and \u00a3740 per child including flights and 14-day motorhome rental with insurance. </p> <p> <strong> 8 Up country</strong> <br> Cottage agency <a href=\"http://www.helpfulholidays.com\">Helpful Holidays</a> (01647 433593) has no less than 42 West Country properties with indoor heated swimming pools to beat the rainy day blues and a further 33 which have outdoor pools. Prices for a former granary sleeping four near Huntsham in Devon start from \u00a3615 for a week during peak season. One of a cluster of five cottages, it shares two acres of grounds, a children's play area, pet's corner and a heated indoor pool.

Not really, but there was an American gentleman who rang to say that he had arrived in West Yorkshire and could we possibly give him directions to Woolley Grange as he was having trouble finding it. He hadn't realised that there are two Bradfords in England. Woolley Grange 01225 864705 Email: info@woolleygrange.com Double rooms from \u00a3105 per room per night with full English breakfast.

Sorry, mobile homes. After two successive all-inclusive summer holidays in very decent far-off hotels, could I sell this idea of luxury back home? To help me was a new initiative by Keycamp, football coaching at several of their sites for children between five and 16. With a boy of nine and a tomboy of a girl aged seven it was a decent stash of extra ammunition. I didn't need it. To my surprise and delight, the family thought 'luxury camping' was well worth a try after the all-inclusive pamperings of '98 and '99 and were happy to give it a go. </p> <p>We had a fortnight to survive at two sites - the first in the Vend\u00e9e, a site surrounding a chateau at La Foret, St Julien, just 15 minutes drive from the coast; the second in the picturesque Loire Valley at Saumur, close to the river. </p> <p>So was this spirit of adventure rewarded? Absolutely. From the moment we parked our car outside the mobile home at La Foret, my son, Kit, and daughter, Holly, were sold. Other parents don't need to be told - if you have happy children on holiday it invariably means a happy holiday for all. </p> <p>Football had to wait until Saumur but, overall, the first week just edged it - and it was a close call - for two reasons. The La Foret site was smaller and friendly and no less well equipped but, more importantly, the Keycamp on-site couriers were magnificent, especially in their dealings with our children. They were made to feel special; that they had new friends. Kids' clubs, often viewed as a chore to be endured by our children, were must-have affairs - as was the evening kids' disco. Within 48 hours they had drilled me in the dance routine to S Club 7's 'Reach'. Quite a sight in the shadow of the chateau, I can tell you. </p> <p>The brochure promised a holiday 'perfect for children with a wide range of activities right on our doorstep. Our campsites are like open-air hotels with pools, bars and restaurants and plenty of space for children to play safely - campsites to suit all tastes - some are small and peaceful, others large and lively with plenty of activities'. </p> <p>Spot on. La Foret is a small-to-medium site but truly charming. In the outbuildings surrounding the main building were bars, the disco, offices, shop - hot croissants on offer each morning - cycle rentals, restaurant and separate take-away. Set in beautiful woodland it has a stunning lake as well as its own swimming pool. The short drive to the beautiful beach at Les Sables d'Olonne is a bonus. </p> <p>Luxury? At La Foret, we pitched camp, as it were, in one of Keycamp's Supernova 29 mobile homes which came equipped with a master double-bedroom; open plan kitchen and dining area featuring cooker and fridge-freezer, gas fire; hot and cold running water, shower and toilet; a second bedroom with two bunks and facility to transform the 'lounge' seating into more beds; a gas-fired barbeque_ and a stereo radio-cassette mounted in the wall. Promising. </p> <p>That promise was fulfilled. We were more than happy with that and very comfortable. There was not even a hint of a twitch from the old toe wound. The children were always occupied on site and there was more than one old-fashioned look from them when we decided to explore beyond the chateau. The small town of La Mothe-Achard was only four miles away with a hypermarket for provisions and an excellent market worthvisiting. </p> <p>Week two, and off to Saumur, a busier, more spacious site on the north side of the Loire just a couple of miles from the historic town. It had a fine restaurant and an excellent, child-friendly fun-pool area. Here we were billeted in a Grand 3B (three-bed) mobile - Keycamp's five-star home to the Supernova 29's three-star-plus. My ratings, not theirs, and significantly larger and more luxurious, complete with CD system. On the downside, the couriers here were much more matter-of-fact which initially disappointedthe kids. At La Foret, courier Rachel Steele was the kids' club head honcho and treated it as a vocation. She was magnificent. At Saumur, they did a perfectly adequate job - no more, no less. </p> <p>But then there was the football. My boy is determined not to follow his father as a committed football nut but even he enjoyed the fun, discipline and exercise that made up coach Stuart White's sessions on the football pitch at the top of the site. </p> <p>Would you believe after only a couple of sessions he had eight-year-olds perfecting Cruyff turns? The kids loved it, even Holly, one of several girls made welcome on the course. All the youngsters had a chance to referee five-a-sides too, a smart idea.

It is not so much a family holiday, more an exercise in sustained logistics and temper control. </p> <p>Yet matters needn't be like this. With a little planning, you can ski and enjoy your children at the same time, as we did on our last trip to St Anton. Our trick was simply to go our own way, ignore ski-school and instead indulge in a few, carefully selected private lessons for our children. In the end, the cost worked out roughly the same. </p> <p>The crucial point was that we had a family holiday, not a skiing trip for a disparate group of individuals. We took leisurely breakfasts, remained together during the day and stopped for breaks at the same time. Such communal experiences are not necessarily an unalloyed joy, of course.

But that does not mean parents have to suffer them every vacation. At some point you deserve to reap the rewards of your indulgence, and your offsprings' hard graft, by sharing the slopes with them. In a few years, they won't be seen dead with old duffers like Mum and Dad, after all. </p> <p>The ambience of our hotel, the Rosanna, was a critical influence.

It remains a town to wander round, with the grounds of its ski museum and restaurant providing a particularly fine setting for prolonged snowball fights. There are also signs of real Austrian affluence here, of which our favourite example was the Harlekin coffee house we where drank hot chocolate in cups the size of wastepaper bins every evening and which were a particular favourite for Olivia (5) and Tom (9). </p> <p>The queues that once marred the resort have disappeared since the construction of a six-person chair in place of the old two-seater from Gampen to Kapall and double chair lift replacing the mass T-bar at Rendl.

We weren't going to see the end of the race - not without embracing certain death - but no matter. It's the taking part that counts. </p> <p>We were at the Reichenbach Falls, where Conan Doyle tried unsuccessfully to kill off Sherlock Holmes. The spot of the detective's mano a mano battle with the dastardly Moriarty is marked by a white star placed on the cliffs, and can be reached by a muddy walk through thick forest. We had already walked far enough, so ambled back down to the cog-driven funicular railway that makes the ascent from Meiringen - home of the meringue, as our stomachs full of cream reminded us - a great deal less breathless. </p> <p>Meiringen is only 14km from the village of Sorenberg, our base for the week, as the crow flies. But unlike the crow we can't soar over the 2,500m Brienzer Rothorn which looms above our farmhouse verandah. The mountains dictate that everywhere is further away than it seems. Back at the bottom of the funicular, I consulted my Rough Guide (you'd think they might have renamed it for Switzerland - you couldn't imagine anywhere less rough. Every time we passed the local police station, the officers of the law were engaged either in watering their many window boxes or taking flatpack Ikea furniture inside).

This is where immovable object - millions of tons of rock - meets irresistible force - the water. And the force wins, carving a contorted passage to the bottom.

      "bodyText": "It would appear to be an admission of boredom, chiming perfectly with one's suspicions about the excitement of Swiss life, to suggest that the highlight of a high summer week in the Alps was a game of Poohsticks. But we'd never played it in such grand - and noisy - surroundings. On one side of the narrow bridge over which the six of us threw our twigs, sticks and, in one overexcited case, small logs was a foaming pool of cold water, on the other a vertiginous drop, one of five cascades in a 650ft fall. We weren't going to see the end of the race - not without embracing certain death - but no matter. It's the taking part that counts. We were at the Reichenbach Falls, where Conan Doyle tried unsuccessfully to kill off Sherlock Holmes. The spot of the detective's mano a mano battle with the dastardly Moriarty is marked by a white star placed on the cliffs, and can be reached by a muddy walk through thick forest. We had already walked far enough, so ambled back down to the cog-driven funicular railway that makes the ascent from Meiringen - home of the meringue, as our stomachs full of cream reminded us - a great deal less breathless. Meiringen is only 14km from the village of Sorenberg, our base for the week, as the crow flies.

      "body": "<p>An enjoyable part of a family holiday - any holiday, for that matter - is the planning, the poring over brochures months in advance and checking the best way to get from A to B, perhaps with a nice stopover at C on the way and D on the way back. But this time we wanted to keep it short, simple and un-adventurous: no overnight extras, no 30-hour journeys to Italy with the children bored silly, no motorway tolls, no long ferry crossings, no hassle. </p> <p>Our brochure showed dots and squares all over Western Europe, with some dots having a far better grading than others and the orange squares looking the best bet - 'large holiday complexes with a vast range of sports and on-site activities, children's clubs, cr ches, entertainments, restaurants and shops'. Then there was an orange dot just across the water, halfway between Dieppe and Boulogne and as near to our Brighton home, as the crow flies, as Bournemouth. </p> <p>The weekend before we left, we went to a wedding in Falmouth. It took eight hours to get there. The door-to-door journey to Belle Dune, our chosen holiday village on the Picardy coast, was three hours shorter, thanks to the new, fast, and very local Newhaven-Dieppe ferry. Everything was going to plan. It stayed that way, too, for two weeks. The only real quibbles were the size of the holiday homes and the golf score. </p> <p>Of course, from a post-floods perspective, in the dark midwinter, summer holidays are always that much more enjoyable. So, to check on what really happened, it's over to Bonnie, aged seven, and Victor, three-and-a-half. What do you remember about the holiday in France? </p> <p>'The swimming pool.' </p> <p>What else? </p> <p>'Lots of bike riding.' </p> <p>And Victor? </p> <p>'The slides.' </p> <p>As in the swimming pool slides, indoors and out. The fact that he was allowed on them at all put the place miles ahead of so many pools in Britain where the local council's insurance policy can ruin a day out. Three slides, a wave machine, a toddlers' pool, a caf\u00e9 that served chips, a shop that sold inflatables, an ice-cream stand and a sandpit. A mini-village all on its own, and so many hours were spent there it would have become boring for the grown-ups if it hadn't been such hard work slogging up the steps to the slide or trying to translate underwater handstand into Italian for Bonnie's latest friend (and she made plenty of them). </p> <p>There was plenty of water elsewhere, with the village built around a small lake. This was where children of various age groups and nationalities would be taught how to sail, fish and paddle a canoe. And where children of one nationality - British - would regularly fall in, especially from the canoes. It was only a couple of feet deep, though, and they enjoyed their dip. </p> <p>That was about as rowdy as it got, which was not that surprising considering what Belle Dune didn't have. Namely: no roads, so no cars or motorbikes and no car stereos; no large groups (families only); no loud teenagers (definitely not a cool place to be seen, so only the Dutch teens turned up in numbers); no 18 to 25-year-olds, no mobile phones going off all the time, no drunks, no swearing (except for one word from the boy in the Warrington Wolves rugby league shirt whose table tennis ball blew into the lake; and a few in the bunker on the 14th hole). If that sounds too sterile, don't go. For us, for two weeks, it was bliss. </p> <p>Although I had a good night out in the launderette - enjoying a junk novel while impressing the ladies by showing them how to work the slots - the main action was down in the square. Here was the bar, which served all the usual French drinks, plus pints for the English. Next door was the restaurant, where the buffet dinners were more than adequate, and very exciting for the children when it came to pudding time. And outdoors were the tables from where you could keep an eye on the young cyclists, who usually stayed up till at least 11pm. </p> <p>The square was also the epicentre for those great family fun nights - square dancing and that sort of thing - that provided staple entertainment in the evenings. The best night was the 'sports contest' when all members of the family team had to hit a golf ball into a kennel, catch a ball with an egg cup when it rolled out of the gutter, throw some darts, guess what was in the dustbin, catch a bottle with a fishing rod and so on. We came fourth, Bonnie's friends from Essex came third, and with an English family finishing first as well it was a great night for British sport. Those French, Dutch, Italians and Germans took a right pasting. </p> <p>When the action was too hot down at the square, we'd saddle up and head into town. That meant Bonnie and Victor riding as fast as they could for a mile and a half along the footpath into the nearby village, the name of which has already erased itself from memory, while we chased after them. </p> <p>The reason for their haste was the racing car ride at the permanent mini-funfair, and the ice-cream shop. There was also, in daylight hours, an exceptional beach. As there was at the other village, the other end of Belle Dune and the other direction on the mini-train which ran to the beach and back every half hour. And two very playable crazy-golf courses, a bi-weekly market (great kippers), and a riding centre that we attended six times. It was only Fr65 for Bonnie to spend an hour on a pony in a group session for absolute beginners, while Victor could sit on for a trip to the beach and back for Fr25. They loved it. </p> <p>All these facilities, like the golf course, were accessible by foot, bike or mini-train. You didn't need a car at all, though of course the car radio was very useful on Saturday afternoon to tune in to live commentaries from Goodwood (good BBC reception is yet another advantage of staying close to the Channel). And it was much quicker to drive than take the train into town for croissants and baguettes in the mornings. But whatever you do, if you go, don't forget the bikes. You can hire them on site, but it's not cheap. </p> <p>There are lots of other things you can do on site, too. Hire a boat, play tennis, play golf, pack the children off to the kids' club - various age groups, lots of activities on the water, at the beach and so on. Ours didn't like it, at least until they made friends, and some parents weren't happy with the level of supervision. But if you're not happy, or they aren't, you can do your own thing - like the pony rides. </p> <p>The golf was one of the biggest attractions for the Brits. It was a spectacular course through the pines and dunes and cost less than \u00a320 a round, which for me worked out at less than 20p a shot. Great value. </p> <p>And finally? The quibble. The houses look like toytown dwellings, and I'm sure Noddy and the Teletubbies would find them very comfortable, but Big Ears and Dumbo wouldn't. The kitchens are just about passable, the balconies very pleasant, but there's next to no storage space. Don't rent a smaller one.</p> <p><strong>What it costs</strong></p> <p>The Oliver family travelled with <a href=\"http://www.eurovillages.co.uk\">Eurovillages</a> (01606 787919).

His collection, which spills from the 50s tract house he's always lived in on Mulholland Drive into the homes of friends, family, and women - current and former - includes masterpieces by C\u00e9zanne, Rouault, Chagall and Magritte. With me now headquartered in California, we became much closer.</p> <p>Often I'd get a phone call from Bob Colbert, Jack's business manager, inviting me over to Mulholland. When I got there, Jack and Bob would be at the kitchen table, working on their cheeseburgers, catalogues at the ready.</p> <p>'Here comes the Venusian!' Jack would shout, because he loved to tease me that I came from another planet. 'Come on, Tod, let's go shopping.'</p> <p>And we'd go at it for hours, debating our picks and our strategy. The only thing that could interrupt us would be Jack's beloved Lakers. If they were on TV, Jack would glance at his watch and leave us with a laugh and a wink, 'Hey, gotta go now.'</p> <p>The occasional bidding or buying I'd done for him evolved into an investment stash that Jack initially funded with $600,000, with which I was to buy, sell and barter art on our behalf. The two of us, he said, should have some fun, and if we made a few bucks together (as we did), so much the better.</p> <p>One day, I came across a painting that said 'Jack' to me. It was by Maxfield Parrish, the celebrated American painter/illustrator from the turn of the century, and it depicted a grinning man struggling under the weight of a giant brown sack he carried over his shoulder. It was entitled The Sandman , after the fairytale figure that sprinkles grains of sands on the eyelids of children to put them to sleep.</p> <p>I called Jack.</p> <p>'I have something special I want to show you,' I said.</p> <p>'Well, come on over, Babycakes,' he replied. 'Let's have a look.'</p> <p>When I got to Mulholland Drive, Jack met me at his door. He took the painting from me and held it in his arms, taking it in. He scrutinised it.</p> <p>Suddenly I saw that big tears were welling in his eyes. Still without a word, he turned from me and walked quietly up the stairs to his private domain. He went into his bedroom, and there he hung The Sandman over his own bed. It had moved him, he told me later. It had spoken to him of his childhood.</p> <p>In my own childhood, growing up a poor Italian-American kid outside Manhattan in Yonkers, I'd never dreamed that I'd come this close to the magic and power of Hollywood. What I wanted was to become an artist, and when I was rejected by the school of my choice I took a job at a funeral parlour and then later as a stagehand at the Metropolitan Opera.</p> <p>In my spare time, I spent whatever money I had on turn-of-the-century furniture and ceramics. Eventually, Stickley pieces were stacked to the ceiling in my tiny apartment off Washington, with the overflow stashed in the homes of friends and relatives. The more I collected, the more I came to believe that sooner or later Art Nouveau and Art Deco, the twin crazes of the 60s and early 70s, would run their course, and why couldn't these works I loved take their place? Finally, in partnership with my cousin Vance Jordan and armed with all the vigour and ignorance of youth, at 27, I decided the time had come to make my move.</p> <p>In 1976, Soho was still a down-at-the-heels bohemia, but the minute I walked into the space at 457 West Broadway, I saw - imagined into being - my 'theatre of Art'. The ceilings dripped, the floors had holes in them, but the rent was dirt cheap, and there were 5,000sqft. After a few months of scraping money together, we transformed the space.</p> <p>From my experience backstage at the Met, I knew what lighting alone could do. I showed off our works with beam shapers and pin spots, filtering them to warm up woods and bring up horizon lines on the paintings. Our pieces were restored and polished to a high dramatic sheen, and with them we designed vignettes - environmental ensembles of furniture, lamps, tapestries, and paintings - showing how a still unfamiliar art form might look in a Fifth Avenue apartment or a Soho loft. We mounted memorable exhibitions, like the Martin brothers show, when we turned our gallery into the salon where these eccentric and wildly talented ceramists worked in turn-of-the-century London. Horsedrawn carriages brought our celebrity guests down to Soho in period costume for the opening. The show was a sell-out and rescued the Martin brothers from a near-century of oblivion.</p> <p>Validation is key in the art world, but it has to come from outside sources, including independent appraisers, academic experts, museum curators. The Metropolitan Museum of Art was planning to open a new Arts &amp; Crafts wing. I convinced Nonnie Frelinghuysen, the Met's curator of American decorative arts, to accept a monumental Fulper piece from the Fulper family and commit to displaying it prominently. Now I only needed to get to the family and convince them to donate this magnificent example of American ceramics. I travelled out to Flemington, New Jersey, one afternoon to talk to them. They were intrigued, but how did I know the Met wouldn't simply stick the piece in the basement, never to be seen again? I gave them my solemn guarantee. The piece went into the Met's permanent display (where it still is) and as a result every self-respecting collector was clamouring for Fulper, raising the price on a Fulper vase tenfold - from $500 to $5,000 - in the course of a year.</p> <p>Undoubtedly the most important validation comes from the great auction houses, Christie's and Sotheby's. News of the price fetched by a major piece in a Christie's sale reverberates throughout the art world, and it therefore became the goal to control and manipulate such events using a network of operatives. Auction houses need goods to sell, and I was delighted to oblige. Moreover, they were just as eager to have me participate in the biding, openly or secretly. The rising market for that speciality increased Christie's commissions - not only guaranteeing future auctions but also validating the work I sold. It was a cycle I influenced and profited from, sometimes rather questionably.</p> <p>One of the most elaborately engineered schemes took place one afternoon in the early 80s at a Christie's auction. When I arrived, a fellow dealer handed me a catalogue in which selected items had been annotated in a code no one else would have understood. In effect, it told me what certain collectors intended to bid for certain items. I was interested in one item in particular, a handsome Stickley piece that came from a private collection. I knew a fair bit about it.</p> <p>In the upstairs auction room, I sat in my reserved seat, prominently in view and ready to bid. Experienced collectors like to see a known dealer bidding, under the assumption that if a dealer bids X dollars, he must have a client ready to pay double that. When the Stickley piece came up, I joined in the early bidding. It started well below the estimate and rose slowly by $1,000 and $2,000 increments. But once it passed the estimate, the atmosphere suddenly became charged. I knew, from my coded catalogue, that there was one collector in the audience who was ready to go well beyond the top-end estimate, and, as it turned out, he even bid past his own maximum. But he didn't win the piece. The winning bidder was 'an unknown collector' from New York City. Not even Christie's knew who it was exactly, or that the unknown bidder worked for me. The only part of the secret arrangement that Christie's knew about was that it was the Jordan-Volpe Gallery that had put the piece on the auctioneer's block to begin with.</p> <p>What was the point of secretly putting up a piece and then secretly buying it back? I wanted to raise the price of the rest of our Stickley inventory. The gallery had a lot of it, and it was lagging in value compared to its more ornate and striking counterparts. The drama of the auction, which I could point to and publicise, allowed me to more than double the price on every piece of Arts &amp; Crafts furniture I owned.</p> <p>We massaged the market. I pooled and price-fixed with other dealers. Sometimes we agreed to cover each other at auctions in cases where we might end up acquiring very expensive pieces. There were restorations passed off as originals, and even outright forgeries. But if there were times we may have crossed the line, the excitement we created brought thousands of works of art to levels of appreciation they had never enjoyed before. The decorative arts collections of major American museums possess innumerable pieces that once passed through our hands.</p> <p>And yet the gallery rarely made the profits that people thought we made. We needed to keep our inventory up regardless of cost, and this was only part of the operation's mounting expense. I see now with the benefit of hindsight that I was another part of the problem. It wasn't that I didn't like money myself, but it just slipped through my fingers. And sometimes I gave pieces away for things far more important to me than money.</p> <p>Back in the mid-80s the late photographer Robert Mapplethorpe was a regular at the gallery. He used to drop in from his loft on Bond Street almost every day around five, and sometimes I'd lend him pieces - on approval - for his shoots, including a wonderful pedestal on which, I discovered one evening on visiting his loft, he was posing his black lover of the moment. But there was something I had that Bobby craved, a matching pair of colossal bronze heads of the god Pan from the French Belle \u00c9poque. At a Dionysian fete at the Palladium, Bobby approached me. I'd brought the price on the Pans down to $25,000 for him, but that was as far as I was willing to go. That didn't, however, deter Bobby.</p> <p>'My pictures are in demand,' he said. 'How about it? I'll do you in exchange for the heads.' That day he followed me around armed with a small, ancient Leica camera that he advanced with a hand crank. I'd had the Pans delivered to my apartment for the shoot, thinking that I'd send them on to his loft the next day. But Bobby couldn't wait.</p> <p>'I'm taking them with me,' he insisted, once the work was done.</p> <p>So the two of us manoeuvred the Pans, one after the other, out on to the street and into a taxi, and off Bobby went, thoroughly delighted with them. The Jordan-Volpe gallery got nothing, but a decade later, when I lost almost everything, I managed to rescue from the wreckage of my life several portraits of me, signed by Robert Mapplethorpe, in frames chosen by the photographer.</p> <p>I should have seen that the end was near for me when I was called to work for a man whose apocalyptic visions, complete with fireballs and chase scenes enacted in films like Top Gun and Bad Boys , had made him one of Hollywood's top producers. Don Simpson had been on Joel's early hit list for me, but with his drug-enriched paranoia (he eventually died of an overdose), it took him several years - and my work with the Bruckheimers' collection and, finally, Don Umemoto, the architect - to decide I was OK.</p> <p>Umemoto's path and mine crossed often in Los Angeles, and inevitably we began to help each other out. One afternoon, Umemoto called me from Simpson's new house. 'He wants to see you right away.' I drove over to Bel Air and went in, through the gates, up the long driveway, to a massive stucco edifice with Spanish tile roofs. Renovations were in full progress, and the rooms were totally empty. Pacing the floor was Simpson, a hulking man of gargantuan vulgarity whose rubberised face was the legacy of countless plastic surgeons. His idea of fun, when bedding some new playmate, was to play erotic videos of himself screwing her predecessor.</p> <p>'Now listen,' he said to me and Umemoto that day. 'Sixty days from now this place is gonna shake, rattle 'n' roll. I'm giving a housewarming party that'll rock the whole fuckin' town. You've got 60 days to finish it, and I don't want any screwin' around, is that goddamn clear?'</p> <p>Then he turned to me.</p> <p>'They say you're OK,' he said. 'Well, fit it up with your best stuff. Get it done. I don't give a fuck what it costs. Just don't screw me. I find out you're screwin' me, I'll cut your balls off.' The more I saw of Simpson, the more I believed that he might just make good on his threats.</p> <p>He wanted dozens of everything - furniture, pottery, carpets, lamps - multiplied by every room in the house. I was at his house when the pieces got delivered, and I went from room to room, placing them carefully, only to find the next day that the control freak who was employing me had switched everything around during the night.</p> <p>Simpson paid on time, which was good, since I sorely needed the money, but he took it out in abuse. Whenever he saw me with other people present - and there were always other people present - he'd start rolling up his sleeve, make a mock tourniquet, and say, 'Here comes The Pusher. He's worse than drugs.' Maybe that was some sort of insight into an addict's persecution complex: I was there only because he'd ordered me to fill up his house for him.</p> <p>At least I got off better than Umemoto. 'Fucking gook!' Simpson was screaming one day when I showed up. He'd just decided that he hated the green marble that the architect had laid down in the entrance way. 'Wait till I get my hands on him! I'll kill that motherfuckin' son of a bitch!' People in a rage often threaten to kill, but with Simpson, when you saw the blood rushing to his remade face, and his twisted grimace, and you remembered that he snorted cocaine from morning till night till morning, it was something else again. Fortunately, the architect was nowhere to be found that day.</p> <p>The 60 days passed, and somehow we got the job done. I have no idea whether Simpson's party rocked the town or not, since I wasn't invited.</p> <p>And there you have it. I'd wanted to be a player, to sell art and make movies, but I was just Joel Silver's Art Guy. I'd tried to buy my way in. I'd rented a $6,500-a-month Tibetan palace on Castilian Drive in the Hollywood hills, complete with gardens, pool, a vintage Aston Martin, and Penny Marshall, David Lynch, and Rebecca De Mornay for neighbours. I spent a fortune remodelling it, and copied a lifestyle that my book-keeper calculated was costing me almost 10 times my rent.</p> <p>Once the art market crashed in the early 90s, I found myself in deep trouble. My costs had sky-rocketed and nobody was buying. I decided my only chance was to move back to New York, certain that I'd have no problem getting back into the jet stream of the art world. But by 1993, the other dealers, whom in many cases I'd known and worked with for years, had no intention of letting that happen. Their take had shrunk as well, and there was no chance they were going to share it with a dealer who'd gone Hollywood. I kept up a bold front, took a room at the Regency; you can't let them see you weak, in either Hollywood or the art world. It didn't work;</p> <p>I declared bankruptcy in 1995 with the assurances of my lawyer that I had to tell everything exactly the way it happened or else I'd never get a clean start. So in my bankruptcy proceedings I explained how I worked, how the art world worked, and my connections with celebrities.</p> <p>The art world tends to balance its payments and receipts like a careless household. Holding on to consignment fees, taking from Peter to pay Paul, this is business as usual in the art world. What was I doing differently? One day a lawyer for one of my more aggressive creditors informed my lawyer that they were going to take their case to the FBI. Why? In a federal fraud case, the creditors have a better shot at restitution. More to the point, the FBI loves celebrity cases, the lawyer explained. They'd be just as thrilled as anyone to get a chance to knock on Jack Nicholson's door.</p> <p>The FBI, prodding me to give names and access to major players in the New York art world and the Hollywood elite, investigated me for two years. It ended one morning in rural New Hampshire, when a squad of agents, armed and armoured, invaded the condo I was staying in with my companion and our little daughter. Not long afterward, I pleaded guilty to fraud on five counts, including one involving Nicholson's fund, and made restitution to Christie's and others.</p> <p>I was sentenced to 28 months in the federal prison in Taft, California.</p> <p>Meanwhile, I became a leper in Hollywood. With one month left to go in my prison term, I begged Joel Silver to give me a job, any job. All he could do was impart some Hollywood wisdom: 'When it's over, it's over.' I was worse than a leper: no one came near me, no one knew me. Terry Semel denied that I'd ever ridden in Warners' private jet.</p> <p>I had, though - back in the days when he confided that he would've traded jobs with me. 'Why?' I asked. 'Because you have the freedom to live your life creatively,' he said. 'To make your own choices. I don't even have time to breathe.'</p> <p>The life I'd chosen, the dream Joel had imparted to me that night in the Hollywood hills, ended with little room to breathe - I was disgraced, penniless, and serving out a more than two-year federal prison sentence. When I got out, Jack Nicholson was the only one who called to ask how I was doing. I'd thought of him more than once when I was in there. One day, I received an auction catalogue a friend from New York sent me, and I remembered Jack on the phone, poring over the catalogues, and me thinking that there was a whole world in his 'So?' - money, power, celebrity.</p> <p>There was a Christie's auction coming up, but this time there wasn't going to be any auction madness with Jack, there was no shopping to be done. This was for 'The Barbra Streisand Collection: Important American Arts &amp; Crafts, Architectural Designs, Art Nouveau and Works by Louis Comfort Tiffany'. The catalogue was an elaborate and beautifully illustrated book more than 200 pages long, and it included the three vases I'd brought Barbra that night at her house. The caption read: 'Provenance - Tod Volpe.' It brought me back, if only for a moment, to a world I had given almost everything to create.</p>",

His collection, which spills from the 50s tract house he's always lived in on Mulholland Drive into the homes of friends, family, and women - current and former - includes masterpieces by C\u00e9zanne, Rouault, Chagall and Magritte. With me now headquartered in California, we became much closer. Often I'd get a phone call from Bob Colbert, Jack's business manager, inviting me over to Mulholland. When I got there, Jack and Bob would be at the kitchen table, working on their cheeseburgers, catalogues at the ready. 'Here comes the Venusian!' Jack would shout, because he loved to tease me that I came from another planet. 'Come on, Tod, let's go shopping.' And we'd go at it for hours, debating our picks and our strategy. The only thing that could interrupt us would be Jack's beloved Lakers. If they were on TV, Jack would glance at his watch and leave us with a laugh and a wink, 'Hey, gotta go now.' The occasional bidding or buying I'd done for him evolved into an investment stash that Jack initially funded with $600,000, with which I was to buy, sell and barter art on our behalf. The two of us, he said, should have some fun, and if we made a few bucks together (as we did), so much the better. One day, I came across a painting that said 'Jack' to me. It was by Maxfield Parrish, the celebrated American painter/illustrator from the turn of the century, and it depicted a grinning man struggling under the weight of a giant brown sack he carried over his shoulder. It was entitled The Sandman , after the fairytale figure that sprinkles grains of sands on the eyelids of children to put them to sleep. I called Jack. 'I have something special I want to show you,' I said. 'Well, come on over, Babycakes,' he replied. 'Let's have a look.' When I got to Mulholland Drive, Jack met me at his door. He took the painting from me and held it in his arms, taking it in. He scrutinised it. Suddenly I saw that big tears were welling in his eyes. Still without a word, he turned from me and walked quietly up the stairs to his private domain. He went into his bedroom, and there he hung The Sandman over his own bed. It had moved him, he told me later. It had spoken to him of his childhood. In my own childhood, growing up a poor Italian-American kid outside Manhattan in Yonkers, I'd never dreamed that I'd come this close to the magic and power of Hollywood. What I wanted was to become an artist, and when I was rejected by the school of my choice I took a job at a funeral parlour and then later as a stagehand at the Metropolitan Opera. In my spare time, I spent whatever money I had on turn-of-the-century furniture and ceramics. Eventually, Stickley pieces were stacked to the ceiling in my tiny apartment off Washington, with the overflow stashed in the homes of friends and relatives. The more I collected, the more I came to believe that sooner or later Art Nouveau and Art Deco, the twin crazes of the 60s and early 70s, would run their course, and why couldn't these works I loved take their place? Finally, in partnership with my cousin Vance Jordan and armed with all the vigour and ignorance of youth, at 27, I decided the time had come to make my move. In 1976, Soho was still a down-at-the-heels bohemia, but the minute I walked into the space at 457 West Broadway, I saw - imagined into being - my 'theatre of Art'. The ceilings dripped, the floors had holes in them, but the rent was dirt cheap, and there were 5,000sqft. After a few months of scraping money together, we transformed the space. From my experience backstage at the Met, I knew what lighting alone could do. I showed off our works with beam shapers and pin spots, filtering them to warm up woods and bring up horizon lines on the paintings. Our pieces were restored and polished to a high dramatic sheen, and with them we designed vignettes - environmental ensembles of furniture, lamps, tapestries, and paintings - showing how a still unfamiliar art form might look in a Fifth Avenue apartment or a Soho loft. We mounted memorable exhibitions, like the Martin brothers show, when we turned our gallery into the salon where these eccentric and wildly talented ceramists worked in turn-of-the-century London. Horsedrawn carriages brought our celebrity guests down to Soho in period costume for the opening. The show was a sell-out and rescued the Martin brothers from a near-century of oblivion. Validation is key in the art world, but it has to come from outside sources, including independent appraisers, academic experts, museum curators. The Metropolitan Museum of Art was planning to open a new Arts &amp; Crafts wing. I convinced Nonnie Frelinghuysen, the Met's curator of American decorative arts, to accept a monumental Fulper piece from the Fulper family and commit to displaying it prominently. Now I only needed to get to the family and convince them to donate this magnificent example of American ceramics. I travelled out to Flemington, New Jersey, one afternoon to talk to them. They were intrigued, but how did I know the Met wouldn't simply stick the piece in the basement, never to be seen again? I gave them my solemn guarantee. The piece went into the Met's permanent display (where it still is) and as a result every self-respecting collector was clamouring for Fulper, raising the price on a Fulper vase tenfold - from $500 to $5,000 - in the course of a year. Undoubtedly the most important validation comes from the great auction houses, Christie's and Sotheby's. News of the price fetched by a major piece in a Christie's sale reverberates throughout the art world, and it therefore became the goal to control and manipulate such events using a network of operatives. Auction houses need goods to sell, and I was delighted to oblige. Moreover, they were just as eager to have me participate in the biding, openly or secretly. The rising market for that speciality increased Christie's commissions - not only guaranteeing future auctions but also validating the work I sold. It was a cycle I influenced and profited from, sometimes rather questionably. One of the most elaborately engineered schemes took place one afternoon in the early 80s at a Christie's auction. When I arrived, a fellow dealer handed me a catalogue in which selected items had been annotated in a code no one else would have understood. In effect, it told me what certain collectors intended to bid for certain items. I was interested in one item in particular, a handsome Stickley piece that came from a private collection. I knew a fair bit about it. In the upstairs auction room, I sat in my reserved seat, prominently in view and ready to bid. Experienced collectors like to see a known dealer bidding, under the assumption that if a dealer bids X dollars, he must have a client ready to pay double that. When the Stickley piece came up, I joined in the early bidding. It started well below the estimate and rose slowly by $1,000 and $2,000 increments. But once it passed the estimate, the atmosphere suddenly became charged. I knew, from my coded catalogue, that there was one collector in the audience who was ready to go well beyond the top-end estimate, and, as it turned out, he even bid past his own maximum. But he didn't win the piece. The winning bidder was 'an unknown collector' from New York City. Not even Christie's knew who it was exactly, or that the unknown bidder worked for me. The only part of the secret arrangement that Christie's knew about was that it was the Jordan-Volpe Gallery that had put the piece on the auctioneer's block to begin with. What was the point of secretly putting up a piece and then secretly buying it back? I wanted to raise the price of the rest of our Stickley inventory. The gallery had a lot of it, and it was lagging in value compared to its more ornate and striking counterparts. The drama of the auction, which I could point to and publicise, allowed me to more than double the price on every piece of Arts &amp; Crafts furniture I owned. We massaged the market. I pooled and price-fixed with other dealers. Sometimes we agreed to cover each other at auctions in cases where we might end up acquiring very expensive pieces. There were restorations passed off as originals, and even outright forgeries. But if there were times we may have crossed the line, the excitement we created brought thousands of works of art to levels of appreciation they had never enjoyed before. The decorative arts collections of major American museums possess innumerable pieces that once passed through our hands. And yet the gallery rarely made the profits that people thought we made. We needed to keep our inventory up regardless of cost, and this was only part of the operation's mounting expense. I see now with the benefit of hindsight that I was another part of the problem. It wasn't that I didn't like money myself, but it just slipped through my fingers. And sometimes I gave pieces away for things far more important to me than money. Back in the mid-80s the late photographer Robert Mapplethorpe was a regular at the gallery. He used to drop in from his loft on Bond Street almost every day around five, and sometimes I'd lend him pieces - on approval - for his shoots, including a wonderful pedestal on which, I discovered one evening on visiting his loft, he was posing his black lover of the moment. But there was something I had that Bobby craved, a matching pair of colossal bronze heads of the god Pan from the French Belle \u00c9poque. At a Dionysian fete at the Palladium, Bobby approached me. I'd brought the price on the Pans down to $25,000 for him, but that was as far as I was willing to go. That didn't, however, deter Bobby. 'My pictures are in demand,' he said. 'How about it? I'll do you in exchange for the heads.' That day he followed me around armed with a small, ancient Leica camera that he advanced with a hand crank. I'd had the Pans delivered to my apartment for the shoot, thinking that I'd send them on to his loft the next day. But Bobby couldn't wait. 'I'm taking them with me,' he insisted, once the work was done. So the two of us manoeuvred the Pans, one after the other, out on to the street and into a taxi, and off Bobby went, thoroughly delighted with them. The Jordan-Volpe gallery got nothing, but a decade later, when I lost almost everything, I managed to rescue from the wreckage of my life several portraits of me, signed by Robert Mapplethorpe, in frames chosen by the photographer. I should have seen that the end was near for me when I was called to work for a man whose apocalyptic visions, complete with fireballs and chase scenes enacted in films like Top Gun and Bad Boys , had made him one of Hollywood's top producers. Don Simpson had been on Joel's early hit list for me, but with his drug-enriched paranoia (he eventually died of an overdose), it took him several years - and my work with the Bruckheimers' collection and, finally, Don Umemoto, the architect - to decide I was OK. Umemoto's path and mine crossed often in Los Angeles, and inevitably we began to help each other out. One afternoon, Umemoto called me from Simpson's new house. 'He wants to see you right away.' I drove over to Bel Air and went in, through the gates, up the long driveway, to a massive stucco edifice with Spanish tile roofs. Renovations were in full progress, and the rooms were totally empty. Pacing the floor was Simpson, a hulking man of gargantuan vulgarity whose rubberised face was the legacy of countless plastic surgeons. His idea of fun, when bedding some new playmate, was to play erotic videos of himself screwing her predecessor. 'Now listen,' he said to me and Umemoto that day. 'Sixty days from now this place is gonna shake, rattle 'n' roll. I'm giving a housewarming party that'll rock the whole fuckin' town. You've got 60 days to finish it, and I don't want any screwin' around, is that goddamn clear?' Then he turned to me. 'They say you're OK,' he said. 'Well, fit it up with your best stuff. Get it done. I don't give a fuck what it costs. Just don't screw me. I find out you're screwin' me, I'll cut your balls off.' The more I saw of Simpson, the more I believed that he might just make good on his threats. He wanted dozens of everything - furniture, pottery, carpets, lamps - multiplied by every room in the house. I was at his house when the pieces got delivered, and I went from room to room, placing them carefully, only to find the next day that the control freak who was employing me had switched everything around during the night. Simpson paid on time, which was good, since I sorely needed the money, but he took it out in abuse. Whenever he saw me with other people present - and there were always other people present - he'd start rolling up his sleeve, make a mock tourniquet, and say, 'Here comes The Pusher. He's worse than drugs.' Maybe that was some sort of insight into an addict's persecution complex: I was there only because he'd ordered me to fill up his house for him. At least I got off better than Umemoto. 'Fucking gook!' Simpson was screaming one day when I showed up. He'd just decided that he hated the green marble that the architect had laid down in the entrance way. 'Wait till I get my hands on him! I'll kill that motherfuckin' son of a bitch!' People in a rage often threaten to kill, but with Simpson, when you saw the blood rushing to his remade face, and his twisted grimace, and you remembered that he snorted cocaine from morning till night till morning, it was something else again. Fortunately, the architect was nowhere to be found that day. The 60 days passed, and somehow we got the job done. I have no idea whether Simpson's party rocked the town or not, since I wasn't invited. And there you have it. I'd wanted to be a player, to sell art and make movies, but I was just Joel Silver's Art Guy. I'd tried to buy my way in. I'd rented a $6,500-a-month Tibetan palace on Castilian Drive in the Hollywood hills, complete with gardens, pool, a vintage Aston Martin, and Penny Marshall, David Lynch, and Rebecca De Mornay for neighbours. I spent a fortune remodelling it, and copied a lifestyle that my book-keeper calculated was costing me almost 10 times my rent. Once the art market crashed in the early 90s, I found myself in deep trouble. My costs had sky-rocketed and nobody was buying. I decided my only chance was to move back to New York, certain that I'd have no problem getting back into the jet stream of the art world. But by 1993, the other dealers, whom in many cases I'd known and worked with for years, had no intention of letting that happen. Their take had shrunk as well, and there was no chance they were going to share it with a dealer who'd gone Hollywood. I kept up a bold front, took a room at the Regency; you can't let them see you weak, in either Hollywood or the art world. It didn't work; I declared bankruptcy in 1995 with the assurances of my lawyer that I had to tell everything exactly the way it happened or else I'd never get a clean start. So in my bankruptcy proceedings I explained how I worked, how the art world worked, and my connections with celebrities. The art world tends to balance its payments and receipts like a careless household. Holding on to consignment fees, taking from Peter to pay Paul, this is business as usual in the art world. What was I doing differently? One day a lawyer for one of my more aggressive creditors informed my lawyer that they were going to take their case to the FBI. Why? In a federal fraud case, the creditors have a better shot at restitution. More to the point, the FBI loves celebrity cases, the lawyer explained. They'd be just as thrilled as anyone to get a chance to knock on Jack Nicholson's door. The FBI, prodding me to give names and access to major players in the New York art world and the Hollywood elite, investigated me for two years. It ended one morning in rural New Hampshire, when a squad of agents, armed and armoured, invaded the condo I was staying in with my companion and our little daughter. Not long afterward, I pleaded guilty to fraud on five counts, including one involving Nicholson's fund, and made restitution to Christie's and others. I was sentenced to 28 months in the federal prison in Taft, California. Meanwhile, I became a leper in Hollywood. With one month left to go in my prison term, I begged Joel Silver to give me a job, any job. All he could do was impart some Hollywood wisdom: 'When it's over, it's over.' I was worse than a leper: no one came near me, no one knew me. Terry Semel denied that I'd ever ridden in Warners' private jet. I had, though - back in the days when he confided that he would've traded jobs with me. 'Why?' I asked. 'Because you have the freedom to live your life creatively,' he said. 'To make your own choices. I don't even have time to breathe.' The life I'd chosen, the dream Joel had imparted to me that night in the Hollywood hills, ended with little room to breathe - I was disgraced, penniless, and serving out a more than two-year federal prison sentence. When I got out, Jack Nicholson was the only one who called to ask how I was doing. I'd thought of him more than once when I was in there. One day, I received an auction catalogue a friend from New York sent me, and I remembered Jack on the phone, poring over the catalogues, and me thinking that there was a whole world in his 'So?' - money, power, celebrity. There was a Christie's auction coming up, but this time there wasn't going to be any auction madness with Jack, there was no shopping to be done. This was for 'The Barbra Streisand Collection: Important American Arts &amp; Crafts, Architectural Designs, Art Nouveau and Works by Louis Comfort Tiffany'. The catalogue was an elaborate and beautifully illustrated book more than 200 pages long, and it included the three vases I'd brought Barbra that night at her house. The caption read: 'Provenance - Tod Volpe.' It brought me back, if only for a moment, to a world I had given almost everything to create.",

We've got it pencilled in for our retirement, by which time global warming might have worked its wonders and made the waters a little more temperate, too. I can hardly wait. What it costs The Smith family travelled with DFDS Seaways (08705 333 1116). A nine-night holiday in a Norwegian cottage starts at \u00a3984 in a specified cottage and \u00a3804 in an unspecified cottage in June. This includes return overnight crossings between Newcastle and Kristiansand in a four-berth inside cabin with ensuite, a night in a Kristiansand hotel with breakfast before returning to the UK and six nights in the cottage.",

Magnificent. How different things might have been if at the moment the skirts had come off during Bucks Fizz's 'Making Your Mind Up' the people had risen as one, driven sedately through London - no point starting the new golden era with a traffic violation - stormed Capital Radio and turfed Margaret Thatcher out of Downing Street. </p> <p>There was great happiness at home, therefore, when the chance arrived to spend two weeks doing as little as possible in the Algarve. Especially as it was being offered by the Travel Club of Upminster. This may sound like an outfit specialising in block-bookings for the undiscerning professional footballer, but it has been going for a long time as a tour operator. Back in 1936 Harry Chandler pretty much invented package holidays bicycling round Austria to ask the question that would become a standard for the industry: 'Is everything OK?' </p> <p>Everything went more than OK for us longer than could possibly be imagined. The car rental people were helpful; the directions to the hotel were so detailed that there were only a half-dozen or so navigational errors; the hotel, as promised, was on the beach. Up to the room we hurried to unpack, but some dimwit had plucked the wrong suitcase off the carousel. I blamed Antler, on the ground that if you are in the luggage business you have some responsibility to distinguish your product from your competitors, but I might as well have been screaming at the moon. On the plus side, we made sufficient trips to the airport to iron out those navigational errors and the problem took less than a day to sort. Just as my wife Grainne had come round to the insurance-scam possibilities and had mentally bought her new wardrobe, the wretched Antler reappeared. </p> <p>We were staying at the Hotel Garbe in Arma\u00e7\u00e3o de Pera which, with the kind of serendipitous touch that gives you an early talking-point for the holiday, was the very hotel where my Mum and Dad spent their honeymoon. But when my parents had come here it had been one of only three hotels in the whole of the Algarve whereas, come the new millennium, it was one of perhaps 3,000. Not quite so romantic, then, especially as much of the development in Arma\u00e7\u00e3o has, even according to Berlitz, 'unfortunately not been in the best taste'. </p> <p>No matter, the Garbe has retained a faded Seventies charm: brown, smoky glass in the foyer and straight-down-the-middle-of-the-road entertainment in the bar in the evening. The kind of hotel where oldsters book in for a month in the winter to warm their bones. And very nice, too. </p> <p>Our only problems were geographical and logistical. First, it was toe-curlingly hot. Walking on the beach was like joining up for one of those 'no pain, no gain' experience weekends. From midday to 4pm the best place to be was inside, and with three chil dren the easiest place to be inside, as there are only so many things you can do in a foyer, was the hotel room. We spent a lot of time in that room. Some of it quality. Some not. </p> <p>Second, there's the dinner problem. This remains intractable. Either you stoke up the kids with sufficient chocolate to maintain their energy levels and run the risk of them - having consumed 13 Mini-Milks - taking one bite and throwing up all over the restaurant. Or you starve them, put up with two hours of three-way tantrums and watch them fall asleep face first in their pasta due to exhaustion. Either way it does not make for a relaxed eating environment. </p> <p>Fortunately, this was a double-header holiday and just as we were despairing if we would ever eat dinner in this town again the second week arrived and we moved to a villa in the hills. This was fabulous. A private pool, room to sleep nine, a cleaner for three hours every morning. It was almost embarrassing. Less adventurous families would have stayed put. We, stupidly, felt compelled to explore. </p> <p>Thus it was I spent my 36th birthday at Zoomarine in 40-plus temperatures queueing to watch dolphins, sea lions and a live parrot sketch. The following day we celebrated Grainne's birthday with a lunch in the hill village of Monchique followed by - after one tiny 50-50 mistake - a 90-minute impromptu detour on the most winding road in the Iberian peninsula. </p> <p>There were no excuses. I was sacked as navigator. The next day on a trip to the beach Grainne took a plainly idiotic left and we ended up jamming the hire car in a sand dune. Even a passing stranger in a T-shirt with 'Strong' on the front couldn't help us out.We were jiggered. It was arguably, for this particular ex-navigator, the highlight of the holiday. When we finally returned to the villa we worked out that, if we moved, things went wrong, so to solve this we would stop moving. This worked fine until I was left in sole control of the children. What fun we had locking Little Mo in the car and spraying her with water. What fun she had playing with the controls. What a restful time we had as Mo kipped out in the car. </p> <p>But how embarrassing it was to find when it was time to drive to the airport that our game had completely banjaxed the car battery. Once again, the kind people from the Travel Club came to the rescue. If the holiday had a theme, that was it, and they must have been thrilled to see the back of us.

'It's the stray pot-bellied pigs,' the stable owner told The Observer last week. 'They keep escaping from their garden and coming over here to upset my horses.'</p> <p>For two years, Shone has lived next to the Kilshaws, the couple who last week shot from anonymity in the Welsh village of Buckley to international infamy. The pair gleefully revealed last Tuesday that they had paid \u00a38,200 to adopt twin American girls that had been put up for sale on the internet by their natural mother.</p> <p>But instead of sharing the happy news, the world was horrified. Jack Straw, the Home Secretary, described the events as 'appalling'.</p> <p>There was more anger when it emerged that the couple had apparently taken the twins, six-month-old Beverley and Kimberley, from a Californian couple, Richard and Vickie Allen, who believed they were the rightful adoptive parents. Loading the children into a people carrier in San Diego, the Kilshaws had driven more than 2,000 miles across America with the Allens in hot pursuit. After reaching Chicago, they booked flights home to Manchester before the distraught American couple could catch up with them.</p> <p>It emerged that the Allens had already paid Tina Johnson, the head of an adoption brokers called the Caring Heart Agency, \u00a34,000 for the babies.

'It's the stray pot-bellied pigs,' the stable owner told The Observer last week. 'They keep escaping from their garden and coming over here to upset my horses.' For two years, Shone has lived next to the Kilshaws, the couple who last week shot from anonymity in the Welsh village of Buckley to international infamy. The pair gleefully revealed last Tuesday that they had paid \u00a38,200 to adopt twin American girls that had been put up for sale on the internet by their natural mother. But instead of sharing the happy news, the world was horrified. Jack Straw, the Home Secretary, described the events as 'appalling'. There was more anger when it emerged that the couple had apparently taken the twins, six-month-old Beverley and Kimberley, from a Californian couple, Richard and Vickie Allen, who believed they were the rightful adoptive parents. Loading the children into a people carrier in San Diego, the Kilshaws had driven more than 2,000 miles across America with the Allens in hot pursuit. After reaching Chicago, they booked flights home to Manchester before the distraught American couple could catch up with them. It emerged that the Allens had already paid Tina Johnson, the head of an adoption brokers called the Caring Heart Agency, \u00a34,000 for the babies. After two months caring for the twins, the couple claim they were tricked into handing the children back to their natural mother, Tranda Wecker, for a visit. Instead, she gave them to the Kilshaws. It is claimed that the British pair knew the Allens had already paid for the twins. The 'adoption couple', as they have become known to weary locals in north Wales, will begin their battle for permanent custody of the twins on Tuesday at the High Court in Birmingham. The Allens have also called in lawyers, who said the FBI would see if any US laws had been broken.

      "body": "<p>France T\u00c9l\u00c9com will formally launch the sale of a stake in its Orange mobile phones subsidiary tomorrow when it launches the prospectus for the share offer. It will be one of the most closely watched flotations in history. </p> <p>That is not just because of its size - although, at up to \u20ac12 billion (\u00a38bn) it will be one of the largest share offerings ever. Rather, it is because the flotation will be a crucial test of the appetite of international investors for shares in telecoms companies. </p> <p>The significance of that goes far beyond France T\u00e9l\u00e9com and Orange. Behind them is a queue of companies - British Telecom, Japanese operator DoCoMo, T-Mobile of Germany and KPN in the Netherlands among them - which between them want to raise more than \u00a330bn. The success - or otherwise - of Orange's flotation will determine whether they should even bother to hire advisers. </p> <p>A year ago, such nervousness would have been unthinkable. Mobile telephony was, it was agreed, the way of the future. Mobile use was growing faster than even incurable optimists such as Hans Snook, Orange's departing chief executive, could have predicted. Text messaging had become the in-thing among the world's teenagers, and the prospect of clever devices such as Wap phones, which would allow us to check share prices, get emails and even order pizzas, would fuel even faster growth. </p> <p>So it did. Last year in the UK, Orange alone scored a net gain of 4.6 million new subscribers - a 70 per cent rise that took its total to 9.5m.. Other countries were growing almost as fast and Orange was taking more than its fair share. </p> <p>But as subscribers mushroomed, so too did the cost of servicing them. That was brought home last spring when the UK government began auctioning 3G - third-generation - licences. The prices they fetched surprised everyone: Britain raised more than \u00a320bn from five companies. Add in the cost of building the networks and it is estimated that mobile operators are committed to spending more than \u00a3200bn on 3G in Europe alone. </p> <p>Then there is the technology. The much-hyped WAP phones have failed: they are so slow and cumbersome that even the most ardent technophile finds them all but useless. The hopes of the mobile operators are now pinned on the next Big Thing - General Packet Radio Services, which are both faster and permanently on, sparing the hassle of dialling the internet to go online. </p> <p>The disappointment of Wap, combined with signs of slowing internet growth, means investors are sceptical about next big things. The worry is that 2000 was the glory year for mobile phones: from now on, growth will slow and operators will find it hard to generate enough revenue to cover their huge investments. </p> <p>Small wonder, then, that Orange and its advisers sound nervous about the flotation. The timing is dictated by the fact that France T\u00e9l\u00e9com needs to repay \u20ac14bn still owed to Vodafone, from which it bought the British Orange operation last August. While it could probably raise the money in the debt markets, lenders are, if anything, more nervous than equity investors about telecoms prospects. </p> <p>And in telecoms, sentiment is all. As with most technology companies, it is impossible to analyse them according to any traditional technique. The numerous banks advising on the Orange flotation all come up with remarkably similar valuations. But that is not based on anything as fundamental as profits or cashflow - after tax and the costs of investment, there aren't any - but on such things as numbers of customers and how Orange stands relative to its peers. </p> <p>Thus Vodafone is worth around \u20ac3,600 per subscriber, while Telecom Italia Mobil is worth \u20ac2,500 per subscriber. Orange is growing faster than Vodafone, but lacks its extensive network - in particular, the smaller firm has no US presence. Take a mid-point between the two and the valuation is around \u20ac90bn.. </p> <p>Alternatively, there is a multiple of the clumsy acronym EBITDA - earnings before interest, tax and depreciation. Even here, the valuations are based simply on projections of where they will be in three years' time - the first year in which it is likely to make a profit before tax - and compared with projections for its peers. Or how about cashflow - not last year's, of course, but an expectation for the next decade. Average these three and the analysts come up with a valuation of about \u20ac80bn. </p> <p>It is easy to be cynical about such valuation models but, unfortunately for Orange and companies like it, they are all we have. The real question is: should we believe the figures? The answer depends on your view of the market's growth. </p> <p>Orange is certainly in a powerful position - second only to Vodafone in its European coverage. It is Britain's third-biggest provider, but its fastest growing and, through Itineris, France's largest. Its financial performance is far ahead of that of many of its peers. In 2000, SG, one of the banks co-ordinating the flotation, estimates that EBITDA was \u20ac1.7bn, although this was wiped out by \u20ac2.6bn of depreciation and interest costs. </p> <p>It expects this to treble to \u20ac5.5bn by 2003, based on forecasts of around 40 per cent growth in subscribers in France and the UK, and a gradual rise in revenue per unit as higher rates for new services compensate for falling rates for traditional services. Most crucially, however, it believes margins will jump from 14.8 to 27.9 per cent as existing customers use their phones more and the cost of acquiring new ones falls in proportion. </p> <p>On the face of it, these are sober projections which do not depend on the wilder predictions for mobile usage that Orange is making. It sees itself not just as a telephone company but as the provider of a service which, as technology improves, will be a 'remote control for life' - used it for everything from ordering films to paying for shopping. And it will not be just phone clients who use its services. Already, Orange is automatically reading meters for electricity companies. Soon, all sorts of machines, from cars to central heating systems, could be using 'embedded, wire-free devices'. These may not yield much per reading but, multiplied many millions of times, they could be very lucrative. </p> <p>The problem is that translating those earnings to the \u20ac80bn valuations being talked about does require some belief in those growth levels. A multiple of 13.3 times EBITDA for 2003 may not sound high when the average for the market is around 18.5. But that is earnings before tax and depreciation: factor in these and the multiple for 2004 becomes 100. </p> <p>One analyst, unconnected to the float, offers some comfort. On his projections for growth in voice traffic alone, Orange should be able to pay the costs of buying and building the structure for its 3G licences. But is the fact that it may not run out of money enough reason to buy the shares? </p> <p>The uncertainty about the future of the market outweighs three other factors which would at best unsettle any other float. First, Snook, the driving force behind Orange's growth, is to step down as chief executive and after the float will be merely a special adviser . Second, its international businesses - including the French one, already its most successful - will be rebranded Orange. That would be a challenge for any business, never mind one growing as fast as Orange. And third, Orange has been part of the France T\u00e9l\u00e9com group for just six months: not long enough to determine whether it can be successfully integrated. </p> <p>Most observers expect that Orange will get the flotation away, if only because investors realise the consequences of failure would be disastrous for the sector. </p> <p>But the price is unlikely to be generous: it is already being talked down to around \u20ac60bn and if there is further bad news before before bookbuilding closes on 9 February, even that could look generous. </p> <p>But private investors should ignore the lead of the big battalions. They have no obligation to keep the telecoms sector afloat. The shares could get a lot cheaper yet. There is no reason to chase them in the flotation.</p>",

Orange is growing faster than Vodafone, but lacks its extensive network - in particular, the smaller firm has no US presence. Take a mid-point between the two and the valuation is around \u20ac90bn.. Alternatively, there is a multiple of the clumsy acronym EBITDA - earnings before interest, tax and depreciation. Even here, the valuations are based simply on projections of where they will be in three years' time - the first year in which it is likely to make a profit before tax - and compared with projections for its peers. Or how about cashflow - not last year's, of course, but an expectation for the next decade. Average these three and the analysts come up with a valuation of about \u20ac80bn. It is easy to be cynical about such valuation models but, unfortunately for Orange and companies like it, they are all we have. The real question is: should we believe the figures? The answer depends on your view of the market's growth. Orange is certainly in a powerful position - second only to Vodafone in its European coverage. It is Britain's third-biggest provider, but its fastest growing and, through Itineris, France's largest. Its financial performance is far ahead of that of many of its peers. In 2000, SG, one of the banks co-ordinating the flotation, estimates that EBITDA was \u20ac1.7bn, although this was wiped out by \u20ac2.6bn of depreciation and interest costs. It expects this to treble to \u20ac5.5bn by 2003, based on forecasts of around 40 per cent growth in subscribers in France and the UK, and a gradual rise in revenue per unit as higher rates for new services compensate for falling rates for traditional services. Most crucially, however, it believes margins will jump from 14.8 to 27.9 per cent as existing customers use their phones more and the cost of acquiring new ones falls in proportion. On the face of it, these are sober projections which do not depend on the wilder predictions for mobile usage that Orange is making. It sees itself not just as a telephone company but as the provider of a service which, as technology improves, will be a 'remote control for life' - used it for everything from ordering films to paying for shopping. And it will not be just phone clients who use its services. Already, Orange is automatically reading meters for electricity companies. Soon, all sorts of machines, from cars to central heating systems, could be using 'embedded, wire-free devices'. These may not yield much per reading but, multiplied many millions of times, they could be very lucrative. The problem is that translating those earnings to the \u20ac80bn valuations being talked about does require some belief in those growth levels. A multiple of 13.3 times EBITDA for 2003 may not sound high when the average for the market is around 18.5. But that is earnings before tax and depreciation: factor in these and the multiple for 2004 becomes 100. One analyst, unconnected to the float, offers some comfort. On his projections for growth in voice traffic alone, Orange should be able to pay the costs of buying and building the structure for its 3G licences. But is the fact that it may not run out of money enough reason to buy the shares? The uncertainty about the future of the market outweighs three other factors which would at best unsettle any other float. First, Snook, the driving force behind Orange's growth, is to step down as chief executive and after the float will be merely a special adviser . Second, its international businesses - including the French one, already its most successful - will be rebranded Orange. That would be a challenge for any business, never mind one growing as fast as Orange. And third, Orange has been part of the France T\u00e9l\u00e9com group for just six months: not long enough to determine whether it can be successfully integrated. Most observers expect that Orange will get the flotation away, if only because investors realise the consequences of failure would be disastrous for the sector. But the price is unlikely to be generous: it is already being talked down to around \u20ac60bn and if there is further bad news before before bookbuilding closes on 9 February, even that could look generous. But private investors should ignore the lead of the big battalions. They have no obligation to keep the telecoms sector afloat. The shares could get a lot cheaper yet. There is no reason to chase them in the flotation.",

Being a poet, he savours the precise vocabulary of cuts (skew, skill, bezel, quoin) and the suggestiveness of the science; it's impossible, for instance, to touch a diamond, since it is a property of the stone to attract hydrogen from its surroundings, sheathing itself in another element. </p> <p>The shoulder knot is composite, and so is the structure of the novel. Besides the history of the Three Brethren passed on by Katharine, and her search for information about where they might be now, there is also the story of two Iraqi brothers, Daniel and Salman Levy, who arrive in London in 1833 and set up business as jewellers. Hill's ability not merely to generate period detail but to inflect it, to make it his own, is remarkable: not the bare fact of gaslight but 'above him the lamp sighed like a woman turning in her sleep'; not just the props of an Antiques Roadshow desktop but 'he stopped writing, reached for the sand, and let it skitter across the page'. </p> <p>Just how the two narratives converge is one of the secrets of the book.

Hill's attempt to join those ranks with his tale of jewels, royalty, quests and betrayals is aided by his sinuous plotting and his superb conjurations of place (not just Iraq but modern Turkey and Japan). By having Katharine describe her obsession as 'a kind of love that no longer requires people', he covers himself against the likelihood that his readership may find her emotionally lacking. </p> <p>Details of her background are few but precise, details of her appearance few and vague, released with a distracting slowness. She's not old (belatedly revealed as 25), not dark - her blue eyes regarded as unlucky in Turkey - and not small, which turns out to mean tall rather than wide. </p> <p>We may, as she says, recognise ourselves in our ancestors by their making of jewels and weapons - embodiments of love and death - but Hill has a little trouble with those two subjects, or at least with their thriller derivatives, sex and violence.

      "body": "<p>Literature and untimely death are strangely linked. The roll-call of English writers - mostly poets - who are remembered almost as much for their premature taking off as for their individual contributions to the canon includes Sir Philip Sydney, Christopher Marlowe, Thomas Chatterton, John Keats, Arthur Hugh Clough, Gerard Manley Hopkins, Wilfred Owen, Joe Orton and, most recently, Ted Hughes. For the poet especially, an early death can be quite a good career move. </p> <p>Hazlitt said: 'Death cancels everything but truth; and strips a man of everything but genius and virtue. It is a sort of natural canonisation.' </p> <p>Death, of course, is one of literature's great themes, though now overshadowed by our fascination with sex.

      "bodyText": "Literature and untimely death are strangely linked. The roll-call of English writers - mostly poets - who are remembered almost as much for their premature taking off as for their individual contributions to the canon includes Sir Philip Sydney, Christopher Marlowe, Thomas Chatterton, John Keats, Arthur Hugh Clough, Gerard Manley Hopkins, Wilfred Owen, Joe Orton and, most recently, Ted Hughes. For the poet especially, an early death can be quite a good career move. Hazlitt said: 'Death cancels everything but truth; and strips a man of everything but genius and virtue. It is a sort of natural canonisation.' Death, of course, is one of literature's great themes, though now overshadowed by our fascination with sex. One of the finest books ever written on the subject, John Donne's Devotions Upon Emergent Occasions, expresses the transforming effect of mortality in literature perfectly - 'When one man dies, one chapter is not torn out of the book, but translated into a better language.'

      "body": "<p><strong> Laura Cumming</strong> was Waugh's deputy at the Literary Review from 1987 to 1989 </p> <p>You were interviewed for a job on Literary Review over lunch in Soho. Three right answers clinched it, though smoking was a plus: did I play chess, swear expressively and mind a glass of wine? </p> <p>Bron was by far the wittiest and most liberal boss a girl could have. I once went to write a piece about the Western Sahara without any notice; another colleague disappeared for almost a week, having fallen in love. Bron was richly amused and encouraging of both. </p> <p>He was fantastically, exorbitantly generous, threw birthday parties for us, paid at least one intern's pocket money and subsidised my salary with his. (Naturally, he never told me.) He was always helping younger people - getting them contacts, jobs and flats - but he also loved to mock your youthful solemnity. I was allowed to publish as much earnest left-wingery in the magazine as I liked, so long as it appeared in a special section that he christened 'Oppression'. Right-wingery was only permitted if tempered by jokes. </p> <p>Shy and easily bored, he would sometimes pretend to be half-blind or deaf to avoid conversation. Although he could be melancholy, I remember him rallying bravely at the sight of a well-sugared tea, a new piece of copy or a fresh hand of cards - at 5.45, he'd fetch out a bottle from the leg of his desk and we'd play for joke stakes with passing contributors. </p> <p>His fearless originality was the ideal example for novice journalists. Others found him ruthless, especially with the pompous. But he was never pitiless, like his father, except perhaps with himself. </p> <p><strong>Kate Kellaway</strong> was deputy editor at the Literary Review in 1986 </p> <p>I discovered straight away, to my relief, that he did not want to be humoured. He loved strong feeling; our conversations always seemed to be in italics. As a boss, he combined authority, wit, charm and hopeless disorganisation. I was devoted to him. </p> <p>I would never have confided the disappointments of my love life to him, but one morning Bron pronounced me 'off-colour', put a bottle of pink champagne on my desk and proposed lunch at a fish restaurant, explaining gloomily that it was our strict duty to go there: 'Fish is good for the brain.' </p> <p>When he occasionally commissioned an offensive piece, the best way to see it to the spike was with a yawn. If I had expressed outrage, he would have brightened up. To bore was the great sin. He was, I think, deeply (with the emphasis on deep) frivolous. It was hard to know what to do with the reviews written by pretty girls he had met on trains. 'Do you think we might use this?' he would wonder, wistfully. </p> <p>There was always a sense that Bron had just mislaid something that might be quite important. He might pick up the phone and then forget who it was he had been ringing. It never mattered, though, as long as he was there. </p> <p><strong>Anna Ford</strong> was a friend for 20 years </p> <p>He was the most sweet, solicitous and amusing company. For people who didn't know him, it was a surprise. The things he wrote were so vituperative that people thought he was bad-tempered and prejudiced. He was the kindest, most wonderful family man. He was always supportive and if I was getting a bad press he would ring and say: 'Don't believe it, none of it is true.' I shall miss his wit. He was a big critic of hypocrisy and one of London's great figures. A complete one-off. </p> <p><strong>Naim Attallah</strong> was Waugh's proprietor and friend </p> <p> I knew him for 14 years and I loved him so. Our friendship grew and grew. I first met him after he wrote to me saying he had a beautiful daughter, Sophia, who wanted to go into publishing and would I agree to give her an interview. I was so touched by the fatherly warmth he showed that I agreed to see her. I liked Sophia and she joined Quartet Books. Then I met him and the friendship ensued. </p> <p>Normally with an editor and a proprietor there are tensions, but in the 14 years we worked together we never exchanged a single word in anger. His public persona was totally different to his personal one. What he wrote was just contrary, to provoke and entertain. That was what Bron was all about. </p> <p>He really and truly loved women. When he was in their company he always sparkled. </p> <p><strong>Fay Weldon</strong> was a long-time friend </p> <p>He gave the best possible literary parties - not something to be overlooked. I held him in great esteem for his wit, kindness and loathing of cant and control-freaks. He always reminded me of Swift or Sidney Smith, in whose house he so fittingly lived and died. It worries me that he's gone: once his voice could seem facetious, but lately it rang simply true. Who else is left? </p> <p><strong>Muriel Spark</strong> was a friend for 40 years </p> <p>I met him because his father was very taken with my work. I never met his father because I had heard he had bouts of rudeness and I was afraid and kept out of his way. Bron and I had a great rapport.

      "bodyText": "Laura Cumming was Waugh's deputy at the Literary Review from 1987 to 1989 You were interviewed for a job on Literary Review over lunch in Soho. Three right answers clinched it, though smoking was a plus: did I play chess, swear expressively and mind a glass of wine? Bron was by far the wittiest and most liberal boss a girl could have. I once went to write a piece about the Western Sahara without any notice; another colleague disappeared for almost a week, having fallen in love. Bron was richly amused and encouraging of both. He was fantastically, exorbitantly generous, threw birthday parties for us, paid at least one intern's pocket money and subsidised my salary with his. (Naturally, he never told me.) He was always helping younger people - getting them contacts, jobs and flats - but he also loved to mock your youthful solemnity. I was allowed to publish as much earnest left-wingery in the magazine as I liked, so long as it appeared in a special section that he christened 'Oppression'. Right-wingery was only permitted if tempered by jokes. Shy and easily bored, he would sometimes pretend to be half-blind or deaf to avoid conversation. Although he could be melancholy, I remember him rallying bravely at the sight of a well-sugared tea, a new piece of copy or a fresh hand of cards - at 5.45, he'd fetch out a bottle from the leg of his desk and we'd play for joke stakes with passing contributors. His fearless originality was the ideal example for novice journalists. Others found him ruthless, especially with the pompous. But he was never pitiless, like his father, except perhaps with himself. Kate Kellaway was deputy editor at the Literary Review in 1986 I discovered straight away, to my relief, that he did not want to be humoured. He loved strong feeling; our conversations always seemed to be in italics. As a boss, he combined authority, wit, charm and hopeless disorganisation. I was devoted to him. I would never have confided the disappointments of my love life to him, but one morning Bron pronounced me 'off-colour', put a bottle of pink champagne on my desk and proposed lunch at a fish restaurant, explaining gloomily that it was our strict duty to go there: 'Fish is good for the brain.' When he occasionally commissioned an offensive piece, the best way to see it to the spike was with a yawn. If I had expressed outrage, he would have brightened up. To bore was the great sin. He was, I think, deeply (with the emphasis on deep) frivolous. It was hard to know what to do with the reviews written by pretty girls he had met on trains. 'Do you think we might use this?' he would wonder, wistfully. There was always a sense that Bron had just mislaid something that might be quite important. He might pick up the phone and then forget who it was he had been ringing. It never mattered, though, as long as he was there. Anna Ford was a friend for 20 years He was the most sweet, solicitous and amusing company. For people who didn't know him, it was a surprise. The things he wrote were so vituperative that people thought he was bad-tempered and prejudiced. He was the kindest, most wonderful family man. He was always supportive and if I was getting a bad press he would ring and say: 'Don't believe it, none of it is true.' I shall miss his wit. He was a big critic of hypocrisy and one of London's great figures. A complete one-off. Naim Attallah was Waugh's proprietor and friend I knew him for 14 years and I loved him so. Our friendship grew and grew. I first met him after he wrote to me saying he had a beautiful daughter, Sophia, who wanted to go into publishing and would I agree to give her an interview. I was so touched by the fatherly warmth he showed that I agreed to see her. I liked Sophia and she joined Quartet Books. Then I met him and the friendship ensued. Normally with an editor and a proprietor there are tensions, but in the 14 years we worked together we never exchanged a single word in anger. His public persona was totally different to his personal one. What he wrote was just contrary, to provoke and entertain. That was what Bron was all about. He really and truly loved women. When he was in their company he always sparkled. Fay Weldon was a long-time friend He gave the best possible literary parties - not something to be overlooked. I held him in great esteem for his wit, kindness and loathing of cant and control-freaks. He always reminded me of Swift or Sidney Smith, in whose house he so fittingly lived and died. It worries me that he's gone: once his voice could seem facetious, but lately it rang simply true. Who else is left? Muriel Spark was a friend for 40 years I met him because his father was very taken with my work. I never met his father because I had heard he had bouts of rudeness and I was afraid and kept out of his way. Bron and I had a great rapport. He used to come to Italy to see me, and would bring presents. Our relationship was pure friendship and a very nice friendship. He was such a kind and amusing man.",

Bush intervene) is about to be carved in two by judicial decree. His days as an icon are gone. Ken Auletta of the New Yorker sets out here to chronicle this fall and fall. It is a rivetting story, a definitive corporate tale for our times, and Auletta has had the time and access to do a great job. He does not quite pull it off - because, as in his previous books, he is too keen on consorting with the rich and famous, a bit of a celeb collector - but he goes deep enough to raise the most profound questions. The foremost of which is: Has Microsoft had a raw deal? We are not, I guess, invited to jump to that conclusion. We are supposed to conclude that rapacity and ruthlessness and overweening arrogance - the arrogance of Gates - brought it down. </p> <p>Who but a supercilious idiot would have dared to testify so self-incriminatingly on video before Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's court? Why tell so many obvious porkies? Why not settle out of court - at three times of asking - rather than bring his company to the brink of disaster through a mix of myopia and petty rages? </p> <p>Auletta is not in awe of Microsoft, with its jackdaw ways, its profits built on the pioneering work of others; nor does he take Gates at the guru's own, blank-faced valuation. If we are told once that Gates missed the internet revolution until it was (almost) too late, we are told a dozen times. And yet there is still cause for wriggling unease which, with fairness, he expresses well. </p> <p>What was it that Microsoft did that deserves such legal retribution? Is 'justice' what the Justice Department automatically delivers? This, in essence, was the war of the Netscape browser. Microsoft - too dozy over the potential of the net - saw a more brilliant competitor on a roll and used its clout (and Internet Explorer) to try to shut it out. Typical big boy behaviour; and thus a typical Microsoft way of doing business by trying brutally hard. But how hard do sharp elbows have to dig in in the scrum to rate a yellow card?</p> <p>The customer was not complaining. He got a better, cheaper deal (and, like this customer, could still download Netscape on to his PC if he found Explorer too boringly clunky). Netscape was complaining, but hardly going broke - and, tellingly, would surely have used exactly the same tactics if situations had been reversed. Tied pubs, tied petrol stations, a dominant M&amp;S selling only St Michael: when does formidable muscle turn antitrust? You may, like Ralph Nader, cheer as rich, choking bullies get their comeuppance: necessary and all too infrequent retribution in corporate America. Who weeps for Standard Oil? But there is, at least, a problem matching petroleum pipelines to the infinite channels of the net. </p> <p>Bill Neukom, Microsoft's lead attorney, probably makes the case better to Auletta than he ever made it in court. 'Technology is a little like mercury. As I sit here, thinking of the technology business, I can't imagine a monopoly because technology is so fluid.' </p> <p>Look back, with the business historian Pete Drucker, to the early days of computers; to Wang, IBM, Remington Rand, Unisys and more. They have all faded from the front row, victims of a fleeting hegemony. That, surely, was the perception that haunted Microsoft, an arrogance born of desperate insecurity. And among those names, perhaps IBM is the most telling of the lot - a company that underwent its own antitrust trial by fire and, through those flames, lost momentum.</p> <p>Watch Microsoft, perhaps, go the same way. Auletta is best when he explores such issues - will AOL, for all its momentary might, endure? - and broods over the bizarre collection of young visionaries and old pros who built the Nasdaq. He is less good at trawling through the endless, essentially repetitive days in court or goggling at the silken skills of David Boies, the lawyer Justice hired before Al Gore hung his first chad. </p> <p>The war of the suits (crisp, dark and expensive for Microsoft, crumpled blue for Boies) is trivial. So is the technological ignorance Boies and Judge Jackson share. The meat here is not legal, except in the way the law trails in the wake of pounding reality, but more philosophical. Auletta does not begin to explain the enigma called Bill Gates, to balance out the spoilt child, the crass politician and the driven business tycoon. Nor does he put his finger on the chemistry that underpins Microsoft and may now drain away. </p> <p>A tragedy? Certainly, because a cannier chief executive would have sued for peace early on and got it. But would that brighter boss have created Microsoft to begin with? We have not reached the end of this saga. The courts - as in Florida - never end. The judges - as in Florida - change, and so do the political masters. There must be a second edition called World War 3.5 in the works. Meanwhile, Auletta has written more than a thriller of the new media frontier. He has, however patchily, pushed thinking about it to the outer limits.</p>",

It is a rivetting story, a definitive corporate tale for our times, and Auletta has had the time and access to do a great job. He does not quite pull it off - because, as in his previous books, he is too keen on consorting with the rich and famous, a bit of a celeb collector - but he goes deep enough to raise the most profound questions. The foremost of which is: Has Microsoft had a raw deal? We are not, I guess, invited to jump to that conclusion. We are supposed to conclude that rapacity and ruthlessness and overweening arrogance - the arrogance of Gates - brought it down. Who but a supercilious idiot would have dared to testify so self-incriminatingly on video before Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's court? Why tell so many obvious porkies? Why not settle out of court - at three times of asking - rather than bring his company to the brink of disaster through a mix of myopia and petty rages? Auletta is not in awe of Microsoft, with its jackdaw ways, its profits built on the pioneering work of others; nor does he take Gates at the guru's own, blank-faced valuation. If we are told once that Gates missed the internet revolution until it was (almost) too late, we are told a dozen times. And yet there is still cause for wriggling unease which, with fairness, he expresses well. What was it that Microsoft did that deserves such legal retribution? Is 'justice' what the Justice Department automatically delivers? This, in essence, was the war of the Netscape browser. Microsoft - too dozy over the potential of the net - saw a more brilliant competitor on a roll and used its clout (and Internet Explorer) to try to shut it out. Typical big boy behaviour; and thus a typical Microsoft way of doing business by trying brutally hard. But how hard do sharp elbows have to dig in in the scrum to rate a yellow card? The customer was not complaining. He got a better, cheaper deal (and, like this customer, could still download Netscape on to his PC if he found Explorer too boringly clunky). Netscape was complaining, but hardly going broke - and, tellingly, would surely have used exactly the same tactics if situations had been reversed. Tied pubs, tied petrol stations, a dominant M&amp;S selling only St Michael: when does formidable muscle turn antitrust? You may, like Ralph Nader, cheer as rich, choking bullies get their comeuppance: necessary and all too infrequent retribution in corporate America. Who weeps for Standard Oil? But there is, at least, a problem matching petroleum pipelines to the infinite channels of the net. Bill Neukom, Microsoft's lead attorney, probably makes the case better to Auletta than he ever made it in court. 'Technology is a little like mercury. As I sit here, thinking of the technology business, I can't imagine a monopoly because technology is so fluid.' Look back, with the business historian Pete Drucker, to the early days of computers; to Wang, IBM, Remington Rand, Unisys and more. They have all faded from the front row, victims of a fleeting hegemony. That, surely, was the perception that haunted Microsoft, an arrogance born of desperate insecurity. And among those names, perhaps IBM is the most telling of the lot - a company that underwent its own antitrust trial by fire and, through those flames, lost momentum. Watch Microsoft, perhaps, go the same way. Auletta is best when he explores such issues - will AOL, for all its momentary might, endure? - and broods over the bizarre collection of young visionaries and old pros who built the Nasdaq. He is less good at trawling through the endless, essentially repetitive days in court or goggling at the silken skills of David Boies, the lawyer Justice hired before Al Gore hung his first chad. The war of the suits (crisp, dark and expensive for Microsoft, crumpled blue for Boies) is trivial. So is the technological ignorance Boies and Judge Jackson share. The meat here is not legal, except in the way the law trails in the wake of pounding reality, but more philosophical. Auletta does not begin to explain the enigma called Bill Gates, to balance out the spoilt child, the crass politician and the driven business tycoon. Nor does he put his finger on the chemistry that underpins Microsoft and may now drain away. A tragedy? Certainly, because a cannier chief executive would have sued for peace early on and got it. But would that brighter boss have created Microsoft to begin with? We have not reached the end of this saga. The courts - as in Florida - never end. The judges - as in Florida - change, and so do the political masters. There must be a second edition called World War 3.5 in the works. Meanwhile, Auletta has written more than a thriller of the new media frontier. He has, however patchily, pushed thinking about it to the outer limits.",

      "body": "<p>Woe betide anyone who gets in Vince Power's way. This 6ft lump of Irish meat and gristle is the UK capital's most powerful music venue owner. And he didn't get there by being a pushover. </p> <p>'I'm two extremes,' he whispers in one of his central London bars where, on a bitterly cold day, the heating has packed up. 'I'm very soft and I'm very hard and I'm trying to find the middle ground. If anyone tries to turn me over, I take a very hard view of it.' </p> <p>Let's hope the heating engineer turns up pronto then. </p> <p>Power (definitely his real name) once spent the best part of a year trying to gain revenge on a former business partner he believed 'shafted him' on a deal to run the Reading Festival. So what did he do? He bought the land on which the festival was sited. Job done. </p> <p>Power's rags-to-riches story is the stuff of showbiz legend. </p> <p>He rose from an impoverished background to own, under the Mean Fiddler banner, a dozen of the capital's top venues, including the Forum and the Astoria. He runs some of the country's major music festivals, including Reading and north London's Fleadh, plus a quoted internet broadcast business. His businesses and joint ventures combined turn over close to \u00a340 million and make profits of about \u00a34m. </p> <p>In the 18 years since Power opened his first club - a Nashville-style honky-tonk auditorium in run-down Harlesden - he has crossed swords with, and defeated, established promoters, rival venue owners, agents and landowners to become a millionaire several times over. </p> <p>'He has a team around him who are fiercely loyal,' said one rival promoter. 'A lot of them are family. That helps. But where Power scored is that he always went straight to the artist. He pissed off managers and agents, but he got the acts. And now they all have to deal with him, because in London there's only the Brixton Academy and the Apollo that he doesn't own.' </p> <p>Last Tuesday, the man dressed in black jeans and leather and sporting a closely cropped beard entered the City big time. Power announced that he was reversing his meanfiddler.com operation into his other interests. </p> <p>The deal values his venues, restaurants and bars at \u00a332m. He hopes to raise \u00a310m from the float, which he will use to fund a digital music channel based at his venues and to open more venues. </p> <p>So within months Power will become chairman of a plc. Not bad for a man born into a poor Waterford family, one of 11 kids of whom four died at birth, including his twin sister. </p> <p>Growing up in Fifties Ireland was hard. But at the age of 17, 'yer man' won a scholarship to study artificial insemination at a Galway agricultural college. </p> <p>To the disappointment of his mother, Power decided that playing the role of a bull for the rest of his working life was not what God intended. </p> <p>He left for the mainland, and his aunt found him a job as a Woolworths shop assistant in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire. </p> <p>It wasn't until Power hit the smoke that life started looking up. His various odd jobs in Sixties London included night shifts in a Walls ice-cream factory - which ended in disaster when he fell asleep on the job - and a demolition job, smashing roofs for \u00a32 a go. </p> <p>At the time, swathes of London were being cleared to make way for modern estates. Power was amazed at how much furniture people abandoned, and he arranged for it to be sold on. Soon, he opened a shop. </p> <p>His luck improved further when he bought an oil painting for a tenner. It was in the window for less than a day when someone offered \u00a3200 for it. Power realised he might be on to something and took it to Sotheby's. It fetched \u00a37,000 - a tidy sum back in the Sixties. </p> <p>After establishing a chain of a dozen second-hand furniture shops, Power thought the time was right for indulging his passion, music. While he couldn't play, he knew people who could. </p> <p>Power opened the Mean Fiddler in 1982. It was a gleaming purpose-built venue in an Irish part of town at time when spit, sawdust and warm beer were regarded as the norm by most live music lovers. He installed a house band, but found he could pack the place out only at weekends. </p> <p>So Power widened the venue's music policy and tried out new-band nights. </p> <p>What started as a hobby grew into a multimillion pound business. But keeping to the style of a maverick, Power has always eschewed paperwork. 'I keep a lot of things in my head. I don't go writing notes or taking minutes. Perhaps that's all gonna change when I'm the chairman of a plc.' </p> <p>Power's plc will, he believes, see its share price double within a few years. Becoming the only promoter from outside the US to beat the unions and run American music festivals gives him some cause for confidence. </p> <p>'The unions wanted to put 10 blokes on your budget when one bloke can do the same job,' he said. 'I had all that in the first year, but we got it all sorted out. A lot of the leaders of unions are Irish, so we could talk.' </p> <p>Power won't open venues outside London. He says no famous American artist wants to play 'two nights in Birmingham'. Instead he wants to take his Jazz Cafe brand into Paris, Barcelona and one other major European city. </p> <p>But it's in digital television that he believes the real dough is to be made. Analysts predict that quality digital TV content providers will become valuable. </p> <p>The UK has the best digital television sales in Europe, and viewers will soon be able to store favourite shows on set-top boxes' hard disks, rather than videoing them. For companies such as Mean Fiddler that means viewers being able to watch its concerts whenever they choose. </p> <p>'In the long term this will be a profitable game,' says Jay Marathe, head of consulting at Durlacher, the technology incubator and finance house. 'At the moment, digital TV providers are adding local storage capacity to their platforms to grow the market. Premium content businesses like Mean Fiddler will be in demand and in the long-term will enjoy high margins.' </p> <p>Power agrees: 'That's the way we think the business is going. We've done the feasibility studies. We're in negotiations with some of the big stations. It will cost millions to set up, but we think we can be profitable within three years.' </p> <p>Ask Power to name the promoters and venue owners he admires and there is a long silence. At a push he'll name Bill Graham, the influential San Franciscan promoter and entrepreneur who's now dead. Of the many alive only Bob Angus, managing director of Metropolis Music, gets a mention. </p> <p>'This is a fiercely competitive business,' Power says. 'If you're in the business of cardboard boxes there's not so much ego, but this business is driven by ego, and ego can cost you millions. I think we're all driven by it.' </p> <p>But Power's excellent relationship with bands (The Pogues used to swear by him) may be changing. </p> <p>'The business of being able to access acts on the internet makes a band more powerful,' he says. 'They don't have to sign lifetime deals with a record company. The band can just licence an album. Record companies have grown fat on back catalogues. That'll all be different in the future.' </p> <p>In an industry famous for sex and drugs, Power is relatively abstemious. OK, he's got eight children from three partners, but his current partner is of 10 years' standing, and he says he has never taken a drug in his life. </p> <p>You get the feeling he doesn't need chemicals. Power's preferred stimulant, it seems, is - appropriately - power. On leaving, he says he's off to 'a boring accountants meeting'. </p> <p>But you know whose tune his accountants will be dancing to. </p> <p><strong>Profile</strong></p> <p><strong> Name: </strong> Vince Power </p> <p><strong> Born: </strong> 29 April 1947, Waterford, Eire </p> <p><strong> Education: </strong> Awarded scholarship to study artificial insemination of cows </p> <p><strong> First Job: </strong> Woolworth's shop assistant, Hemel Hempstead </p> <p><strong> First Venue: </strong> Mean Fiddler, north London in 1982 </p> <p><strong> Home: </strong> Kilburn, north London </p> <p><strong> Hobbies: </strong> Business, family and horses </p> <p><strong>Vince Power's top gigs</strong></p> <p>1) Roy Orbison</p> <p>2) Limp Bizkit </p> <p>3) Manic Street Preachers </p> <p>4) John Prine </p> <p>5) Dr John</p>",

      "body": "<p>The first babies of the George W Bush presidency were born yesterday into a country transformed by his predecessor. 'When I came into office,' said Bill Clinton, putting it the way he thinks people will most easily remember, 'the World Wide Web had only 50 sites.'</p> <p>Their infancy will be spent in a country that is, for all the profusion of websites, less homogeneous, more complex, less white, more prosperous, less dangerous and more bitterly divided than that in which their fathers and mothers first met.</p> <p>Bush only just made it to yesterday's inauguration, having lost the popular vote and won Florida by a hair's breadth. And so the Bush babies join a nation riven - as the election results and New Year census show - between city and country, black and white, women and men, over what should happen next, over whether to proceed with the Clinton era that ended yesterday or to change course. The latter side won. Just.</p> <p>The story of the transformation of America under Clinton is familiar. The economy is the strongest in a generation, its expansion the longest in American history. A federal deficit of $255 billion a year has been converted into a record projected surplus of $236bn; 22 million new jobs created; a record number of families with access to health care, and so on. It's an America in which politics has been transformed by a President who could be all things to most men (and especially women), who wore an infectious smile and played the saxophone but was also a persuasive statesman and the major international force of his generation.</p> <p>This was a President who at home faced down the barons of big tobacco, oil and guns, but who tangoed with the Merlin of the market, Alan Greenspan. Who swore he had never inhaled just as he swore he 'did not have sexual relations with that woman, Monica Lewinsky'. Who ruled a nation which had both the 'working families' and Wall Street as its bifocal points, and who presided over liberal capitalism's final conquest of most of the world.</p> <p>Clinton was the President of an age of social democracy, wealth (in the West) and exuberance, and he headed an exuberant, if sometimes tumultuous, White House. Now he takes his last flight on Air Force One to Arkansas where it all began, while Bush, in white cowboy hat, bids farewell to Midland, Texas, with a 'local boy made good' routine. It takes a while for Presidents to establish their style as rulers of a superpower and there is acute curiosity as to how this relative novice to politics will shape up - let alone what kind of America he will shape.</p> <p>But there are more than a few clues, starting with the festivities in Washington: goodbye Hollywood, hello Nashville! Goodbye Jack Nicholson and Sharon Stone, hello Sylvester Stallone; goodbye Aretha Franklin and Sheryl Crow, welcome back Loretta Lynn!</p> <p>Most intriguing, though, is that phalanx of stolid men in colourless suits forever behind and beside Bush. Replacing the fresh faces that populated Clinton's White House are men with austere bureaucratic life stories, their big-framed spectacles glinting in the winter sunlight as they emerge from closed corporate boardrooms.</p> <p>There is a generational oddity - even a Freudian dysfunction - in this presidential handover by the baby-boomer Clinton and his crowd. Now it is Bush's big moment, but he has invited all Daddy's friends to the party and sat them at high table: Vice-President Dick Cheney, Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill, Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, Secretary of State Colin Powell and more. Some served not only George Bush Senior but Ronald Reagan, Gerald Ford and even Richard Nixon. And between then and now they have put in long, lucrative stints behind those boardroom doors.</p> <p>So the Bush babies have entered a time warp, born yesterday but flung back a decade to the Cold War, before the shooting stars of Clinton's shiny New Democrats, New Economy, New America and New World, of which these grey conservatives are the antithesis.</p> <p>But this word 'conservative' is just as deceptive among Bush's entourage as the coupling Bush gave it: 'compassionate'. For Bush is launching a radical assault on American culture just as thorough, if not more so, than Clinton's.</p> <p>The media tend not to notice Bush's conservative-radicalism since - being fairly well-off - the editorial sages define politics in social rather than economic terms. So an extreme economic right-winger such as Christine Todd Whitman, who also favours a woman's right to abortion, is welcomed as a liberal in the cabinet. Meanwhile, Gary Bauer - a blue-collar (black) social conservative who rails against abortion but who wants the minimum wage raised and opposes the privatisation of social security - is dubbed a right-wing lunatic, thankfully seen off at the primaries.</p> <p>Whatever tightrope Bush can walk on social policy, his economic plan for America puts him on the hard, radical Right - vacuuming up ideas from hawkish Washington organisations such as the Heritage Foundation or American Enterprise Institute, and harnessing the relentless ideological brawn behind them, Newt Gingrich as was and now Tom De Lay. 'The Bush campaign,' says Jonathan Chait of the New Republic, 'is not a repudiation of the Gingrich revolution, it is the vehicle for its fevered, unredeemed aspirations.'</p> <p>Two policies - on tax and social security - define the philosophy of Bush's America, which is this: the minimisation, de-legitimisation and ultimately abolition of effective federal government. The ultra-right National Review realises this better than the mainstream punditocracy: 'Bush,' it writes, reassuring its libertarian constituency, 'has been reliable on the issues that matter. His support for tax cuts and social security reform is more important than his spending initiatives because if he succeeds on taxes and social security, it will be easier to limit government.'</p> <p>'It's conservative to cut taxes,' said Bush, 'it's compassionate to let people keep more of their money.' It sounds like a Republican 'Third Way'. But who is to 'keep more of their money'?</p> <p>Contrast the federal tax system with that of Bush's Texas. At federal level a family in the bottom fifth of income levels pays less than nine per cent in tax; the top one per cent give 37 per cent of their income to the government. In Texas the tax burden drops as income rises: the poorest pay 13 per cent while the top one per cent pay less than five per cent to the Austin State Capitol.</p> <p>Bush now brings an adaptation of the Texan tax model to Washington, with cuts as top priority as he and his team hurry to push his most urgent agenda through Congress. The top one per cent will enjoy a 43 per cent share of the $1.8 trillion tax cut, aimed at bringing about the 'trickle- down effect' attempted by his father and Reagan. To justify the cut, Bush reads the Ides of Recession, which he blames on his predecessor.</p> <p>Bush pledges to 'reform' social security, but in fact he plans to transform the system. He has told the Houston Chronicle that his scheme to create private savings accounts 'could be the first step towards a complete privatisation of social security'.</p> <p>The Bush babies are born into a 'pay-as-you-go' social security system: parents contribute their slice, which goes directly to someone's grandma. It's an intergenerational transfer payment. Bush's plan is one in which every individual provides for his or her own retirement with funds invested in stocks.</p> <p>This is one of the most drastic alterations to the relationship between citizen and government - breaking an enduring connection - since the New Deal of the Thirties.</p> <p>This abrogration of government will infuse every corner of life. Take guns, for example. Clinton banned semi-automatic assault weapons and did all he could to back legislation seeking to oblige manufacturers to fit child locks on all guns. In Texas you need to train for 150 hours to become a hairdresser, but only 10 hours to buy a gun. 'I guess,' says former Clinton adviser Paul Begala, 'that Bush trusts his fellow Texans with a .45 that can blow you away more than he trusts them with a blow-dryer.'</p> <p>Bush signed a law allowing concealed weapons and repealed another which exempted specific locations from having to accommodate every Texan's right to carry a weapon - so everyone can 'pack heat' in church, hospital or at Houston's Astroworld theme park.</p> <p>For all his initial talk about bipartisanship and unity, Bush has bypassed successive moderates to form a government which is opposed to governing. In Spencer Abraham, Bush has an Energy Secretary who in Congress sponsored legislation to abolish the department he now heads. In Tommy Thompson he has a Health Secretary who, as Governor of Wisconsin, failed to implement tobacco control initiatives and happens to have enjoyed close ties to the Philip Morris company for more than 14 years.</p> <p>The Bush babies will grow up in America the Beautiful, a landscape of breathtaking power, comprising hundreds of millions of acres of wilderness, mighty desert, towering mountains, plunging canyons and all the wildlife they harbour. But will it stay that way?</p> <p>A defiant scramble during Clinton's last days sought to ensure protection for several of these millions of acres under federal law, and an executive order to ban logging or road-building - in effect crippling any plans for oil drilling, mineral mining and suchlike. Bush said he already has lawyers examining 'every opportunity to reverse' these measures.</p> <p>And so America will become a nation of shrinking wilderness and tarnished beauty. Bush is committed to the exploitation of energy resources in wilderness that just happens to be under the protection of Clinton's directives.</p> <p>To administer the 500 million acres of federally protected land, Bush appointed Gale Norton, who boasts a long career of championing business interests against the federal authority she is now assigned to wield. Last week the stuffy Sierra Club (equivalent to the National Trust) joined a chorus of protest against Norton's appointment.</p> <p>Bush's philosophy on the environment comes from Texas, where in 1998 the governor signed a 'Clean Air' Act he had negotiated with oil executives. This allowed companies to set their own pollution control standards. As he signed this law, the town of Odessa was engulfed in toxic clouds so thick drivers had to turn on headlights in daytime.</p> <p>In the same speech as that promising to roll back Clinton's wilderness protection, Bush promised to reverse another ingredient of his predecessor's valedictory package - an endorsement of aid to Russia, aimed to help that country unlock the shackles of communism.</p> <p>Bush's abrogation of Washington's responsibilities will not be limited to American citizens but extended to those of other nations. Clinton took easily to the world stage. He was busily engrossed in the Middle East, the Balkans, Russia, Asia, China, Haiti and not least Ireland. He was usually an ally and sometimes an inspiration to new governments in Western and Eastern Europe.</p> <p>If Clinton had one great idea it was that trade is the most effective diplomat. He turned Uncle Sam's image in Latin America from that of adviser to torturers to trader in new markets. He prised Communist China open, likewise Indonesia, while chastising both for their grotesque record on human rights.</p> <p>Bush's commitment to the international market can be even greater, unfettered by considerations such as human rights and Washington's responsibility to intervene in the world. Here again, there is a fundamental sea change under way. The idea that America is accountable to citizens of the world other than its own is as old and as idealistic as the nation itself. It is an almost moral calling. Henry Kissinger, of all people, writes in his new book: 'American Presidents have invoked their country's unselfishness as the crucial attribute of its leadership role.'</p> <p>But Bush has seen little of the world. The new President is often described as an 'incurious' man, which is odd for one born to a political dynasty who took degrees at Harvard and Yale during the era of cut-price international air travel. 'There is [sic] madmen in the world,' said Bush, outlining his view to the Associated Press news agency last year, 'and there are terror'.</p> <p>'Dan Quayle without the brains,' joked an outgoing senior White House aide, packing up his desk.</p> <p>Although the avuncular and absurdly popular figure of Colin Powell will be the face of Bush's America on the world stage, the propeller behind Bush's foreign policy has been Condoleeza Rice, one of his father's advisers and an expert on Russia (though Bush was captivated by her during a talk about baseball). Rice alarmed European leaders by saying the US intended to pull its troops out of Kosovo.</p> <p>In an article last year for the journal Foreign Affairs, she explained the difference between the Clinton and Bush plans for America-in-the-world. When foreign policy is centred on 'values', she wrote, 'the national interest is replaced with \"humanitarian interests\" or the interests of \"the international community\". There is nothing wrong with doing something that benefits all humanity, but that is, in a sense, a second-order effect.'</p> <p>Rice's view is a radical departure from the traditions not only of Wilson, Roosevelt and Clinton but also Reagan, after a different fashion, and even Bush's own father. He did, after all, forge the coalition that fought the Gulf War (which Powell initially opposed).</p> <p>It is unlikely, then, that Bush would have sent lieutenants to Ireland on a clandestine 'golfing trip' to canvass terrorists on either side on what it would take to do a deal.

      "bodyText": "The first babies of the George W Bush presidency were born yesterday into a country transformed by his predecessor. 'When I came into office,' said Bill Clinton, putting it the way he thinks people will most easily remember, 'the World Wide Web had only 50 sites.' Their infancy will be spent in a country that is, for all the profusion of websites, less homogeneous, more complex, less white, more prosperous, less dangerous and more bitterly divided than that in which their fathers and mothers first met. Bush only just made it to yesterday's inauguration, having lost the popular vote and won Florida by a hair's breadth. And so the Bush babies join a nation riven - as the election results and New Year census show - between city and country, black and white, women and men, over what should happen next, over whether to proceed with the Clinton era that ended yesterday or to change course. The latter side won. Just. The story of the transformation of America under Clinton is familiar. The economy is the strongest in a generation, its expansion the longest in American history. A federal deficit of $255 billion a year has been converted into a record projected surplus of $236bn; 22 million new jobs created; a record number of families with access to health care, and so on. It's an America in which politics has been transformed by a President who could be all things to most men (and especially women), who wore an infectious smile and played the saxophone but was also a persuasive statesman and the major international force of his generation. This was a President who at home faced down the barons of big tobacco, oil and guns, but who tangoed with the Merlin of the market, Alan Greenspan. Who swore he had never inhaled just as he swore he 'did not have sexual relations with that woman, Monica Lewinsky'. Who ruled a nation which had both the 'working families' and Wall Street as its bifocal points, and who presided over liberal capitalism's final conquest of most of the world. Clinton was the President of an age of social democracy, wealth (in the West) and exuberance, and he headed an exuberant, if sometimes tumultuous, White House. Now he takes his last flight on Air Force One to Arkansas where it all began, while Bush, in white cowboy hat, bids farewell to Midland, Texas, with a 'local boy made good' routine. It takes a while for Presidents to establish their style as rulers of a superpower and there is acute curiosity as to how this relative novice to politics will shape up - let alone what kind of America he will shape. But there are more than a few clues, starting with the festivities in Washington: goodbye Hollywood, hello Nashville! Goodbye Jack Nicholson and Sharon Stone, hello Sylvester Stallone; goodbye Aretha Franklin and Sheryl Crow, welcome back Loretta Lynn! Most intriguing, though, is that phalanx of stolid men in colourless suits forever behind and beside Bush. Replacing the fresh faces that populated Clinton's White House are men with austere bureaucratic life stories, their big-framed spectacles glinting in the winter sunlight as they emerge from closed corporate boardrooms. There is a generational oddity - even a Freudian dysfunction - in this presidential handover by the baby-boomer Clinton and his crowd. Now it is Bush's big moment, but he has invited all Daddy's friends to the party and sat them at high table: Vice-President Dick Cheney, Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill, Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, Secretary of State Colin Powell and more. Some served not only George Bush Senior but Ronald Reagan, Gerald Ford and even Richard Nixon. And between then and now they have put in long, lucrative stints behind those boardroom doors. So the Bush babies have entered a time warp, born yesterday but flung back a decade to the Cold War, before the shooting stars of Clinton's shiny New Democrats, New Economy, New America and New World, of which these grey conservatives are the antithesis. But this word 'conservative' is just as deceptive among Bush's entourage as the coupling Bush gave it: 'compassionate'. For Bush is launching a radical assault on American culture just as thorough, if not more so, than Clinton's. The media tend not to notice Bush's conservative-radicalism since - being fairly well-off - the editorial sages define politics in social rather than economic terms. So an extreme economic right-winger such as Christine Todd Whitman, who also favours a woman's right to abortion, is welcomed as a liberal in the cabinet. Meanwhile, Gary Bauer - a blue-collar (black) social conservative who rails against abortion but who wants the minimum wage raised and opposes the privatisation of social security - is dubbed a right-wing lunatic, thankfully seen off at the primaries. Whatever tightrope Bush can walk on social policy, his economic plan for America puts him on the hard, radical Right - vacuuming up ideas from hawkish Washington organisations such as the Heritage Foundation or American Enterprise Institute, and harnessing the relentless ideological brawn behind them, Newt Gingrich as was and now Tom De Lay. 'The Bush campaign,' says Jonathan Chait of the New Republic, 'is not a repudiation of the Gingrich revolution, it is the vehicle for its fevered, unredeemed aspirations.' Two policies - on tax and social security - define the philosophy of Bush's America, which is this: the minimisation, de-legitimisation and ultimately abolition of effective federal government. The ultra-right National Review realises this better than the mainstream punditocracy: 'Bush,' it writes, reassuring its libertarian constituency, 'has been reliable on the issues that matter. His support for tax cuts and social security reform is more important than his spending initiatives because if he succeeds on taxes and social security, it will be easier to limit government.' 'It's conservative to cut taxes,' said Bush, 'it's compassionate to let people keep more of their money.' It sounds like a Republican 'Third Way'. But who is to 'keep more of their money'? Contrast the federal tax system with that of Bush's Texas. At federal level a family in the bottom fifth of income levels pays less than nine per cent in tax; the top one per cent give 37 per cent of their income to the government. In Texas the tax burden drops as income rises: the poorest pay 13 per cent while the top one per cent pay less than five per cent to the Austin State Capitol. Bush now brings an adaptation of the Texan tax model to Washington, with cuts as top priority as he and his team hurry to push his most urgent agenda through Congress. The top one per cent will enjoy a 43 per cent share of the $1.8 trillion tax cut, aimed at bringing about the 'trickle- down effect' attempted by his father and Reagan. To justify the cut, Bush reads the Ides of Recession, which he blames on his predecessor. Bush pledges to 'reform' social security, but in fact he plans to transform the system. He has told the Houston Chronicle that his scheme to create private savings accounts 'could be the first step towards a complete privatisation of social security'. The Bush babies are born into a 'pay-as-you-go' social security system: parents contribute their slice, which goes directly to someone's grandma. It's an intergenerational transfer payment. Bush's plan is one in which every individual provides for his or her own retirement with funds invested in stocks. This is one of the most drastic alterations to the relationship between citizen and government - breaking an enduring connection - since the New Deal of the Thirties. This abrogration of government will infuse every corner of life. Take guns, for example. Clinton banned semi-automatic assault weapons and did all he could to back legislation seeking to oblige manufacturers to fit child locks on all guns. In Texas you need to train for 150 hours to become a hairdresser, but only 10 hours to buy a gun. 'I guess,' says former Clinton adviser Paul Begala, 'that Bush trusts his fellow Texans with a .45 that can blow you away more than he trusts them with a blow-dryer.' Bush signed a law allowing concealed weapons and repealed another which exempted specific locations from having to accommodate every Texan's right to carry a weapon - so everyone can 'pack heat' in church, hospital or at Houston's Astroworld theme park. For all his initial talk about bipartisanship and unity, Bush has bypassed successive moderates to form a government which is opposed to governing. In Spencer Abraham, Bush has an Energy Secretary who in Congress sponsored legislation to abolish the department he now heads. In Tommy Thompson he has a Health Secretary who, as Governor of Wisconsin, failed to implement tobacco control initiatives and happens to have enjoyed close ties to the Philip Morris company for more than 14 years. The Bush babies will grow up in America the Beautiful, a landscape of breathtaking power, comprising hundreds of millions of acres of wilderness, mighty desert, towering mountains, plunging canyons and all the wildlife they harbour. But will it stay that way? A defiant scramble during Clinton's last days sought to ensure protection for several of these millions of acres under federal law, and an executive order to ban logging or road-building - in effect crippling any plans for oil drilling, mineral mining and suchlike. Bush said he already has lawyers examining 'every opportunity to reverse' these measures. And so America will become a nation of shrinking wilderness and tarnished beauty. Bush is committed to the exploitation of energy resources in wilderness that just happens to be under the protection of Clinton's directives. To administer the 500 million acres of federally protected land, Bush appointed Gale Norton, who boasts a long career of championing business interests against the federal authority she is now assigned to wield. Last week the stuffy Sierra Club (equivalent to the National Trust) joined a chorus of protest against Norton's appointment. Bush's philosophy on the environment comes from Texas, where in 1998 the governor signed a 'Clean Air' Act he had negotiated with oil executives. This allowed companies to set their own pollution control standards. As he signed this law, the town of Odessa was engulfed in toxic clouds so thick drivers had to turn on headlights in daytime. In the same speech as that promising to roll back Clinton's wilderness protection, Bush promised to reverse another ingredient of his predecessor's valedictory package - an endorsement of aid to Russia, aimed to help that country unlock the shackles of communism. Bush's abrogation of Washington's responsibilities will not be limited to American citizens but extended to those of other nations. Clinton took easily to the world stage. He was busily engrossed in the Middle East, the Balkans, Russia, Asia, China, Haiti and not least Ireland. He was usually an ally and sometimes an inspiration to new governments in Western and Eastern Europe. If Clinton had one great idea it was that trade is the most effective diplomat. He turned Uncle Sam's image in Latin America from that of adviser to torturers to trader in new markets. He prised Communist China open, likewise Indonesia, while chastising both for their grotesque record on human rights. Bush's commitment to the international market can be even greater, unfettered by considerations such as human rights and Washington's responsibility to intervene in the world. Here again, there is a fundamental sea change under way. The idea that America is accountable to citizens of the world other than its own is as old and as idealistic as the nation itself. It is an almost moral calling. Henry Kissinger, of all people, writes in his new book: 'American Presidents have invoked their country's unselfishness as the crucial attribute of its leadership role.' But Bush has seen little of the world. The new President is often described as an 'incurious' man, which is odd for one born to a political dynasty who took degrees at Harvard and Yale during the era of cut-price international air travel. 'There is [sic] madmen in the world,' said Bush, outlining his view to the Associated Press news agency last year, 'and there are terror'. 'Dan Quayle without the brains,' joked an outgoing senior White House aide, packing up his desk. Although the avuncular and absurdly popular figure of Colin Powell will be the face of Bush's America on the world stage, the propeller behind Bush's foreign policy has been Condoleeza Rice, one of his father's advisers and an expert on Russia (though Bush was captivated by her during a talk about baseball). Rice alarmed European leaders by saying the US intended to pull its troops out of Kosovo. In an article last year for the journal Foreign Affairs, she explained the difference between the Clinton and Bush plans for America-in-the-world. When foreign policy is centred on 'values', she wrote, 'the national interest is replaced with \"humanitarian interests\" or the interests of \"the international community\". There is nothing wrong with doing something that benefits all humanity, but that is, in a sense, a second-order effect.' Rice's view is a radical departure from the traditions not only of Wilson, Roosevelt and Clinton but also Reagan, after a different fashion, and even Bush's own father. He did, after all, forge the coalition that fought the Gulf War (which Powell initially opposed). It is unlikely, then, that Bush would have sent lieutenants to Ireland on a clandestine 'golfing trip' to canvass terrorists on either side on what it would take to do a deal. He will not pore all night over maps of the West Bank or Kosovo, or order GI Joe to hunt down war criminals. Bush does follow world events from Texas, but he keeps returning to the same theme. As he told the Boston Globe: ' This is still a dangerous world. It's a world of madmen and uncertainty, and potential mental losses.' Uncle Sam's defence policy will be not only to 'go home' but to build a stockade around that home, called 'National Missile Defence' - old name, Star Wars - and endorsed last week by Powell as the bedrock of US foreign policy. This is enough to scare the Russians stiff and split Bush's European allies, for whom the prospect of a fearful, angry Russia is more worrying than a rogue North Korean missile.

      "body": "<p>Quite apart from the prigs and puritans and Polly Toynbees, I imagine that people who did not know Bron - the silent majority - must have been bewildered and probably irritated by the huge media outpouring of grief that greeted his death this week.</p> <p>Much greater writers have died with less fanfare; I don't remember the Telegraph devoting five pages to Graham Greene's death as it did to Bron's. A friend of mine said rather sourly, 'I suppose he was the journalist's journalist' and of course, yes - that's exactly what he was. He stood for all the things that attracted me to journalism in the first place, all the things Polly Toynbee most disapproves of - long lunches and gossip and laughter and a mischievous (yes!), and above all irreverent (oh please!) response to pomposity and received opinion.</p> <p>Obviously you needed a sense of humour to appreciate him which is why Toynbee drew a blank - but her claim in the Guardian on Friday that he was the head of some sinister right-wing coterie was risible for those of us who know how to ris. </p> <p>He wrote to no agenda or party line. He did not believe it was the job of journalists to run the country or to advise politicians, but to nip at the heels of sacred cows and expose the inadequacy of the emperor's new clothes. He never pontificated about family values but he lived them, deeply. And however cruelly he wrote on occasions, he was unfailingly kind in real life. He believed that it was our duty to be happy as long as possible because tomorrow we die. He told me once: 'I'm just not prepared to be agonised by all the suffering in the world. There's no point in the world if we've all got to suffer with the suffering, because the whole point is that while some people suffer, others don't.' Hence his tireless crusade to add to the world's stock of jollity and laughter. </p> <p>I first met him 30 years ago when I worked for Penthouse magazine. He wrote me a fan letter having seen me on Call My Bluff; I wrote back, and after that we had regular lunches, where I would ask about books and he would ask about Penthouse. I kept expecting him to make a pass but he never did - on the contrary, he listened sympathetically to the ups and downs of my love life.</p> <p>He was a great listener, especially to the amatory woes of young women. He made me take him to lunch at the Penthouse Club in Shepherd's Market. I warned him he wouldn't like it but he insisted so I took him there and he was terribly upset when all the Penthouse Pets came and talked about their boyfriends and their father's new kidney machine - I think whatever fantasy he'd had about life at Penthouse died that day. </p> <p>We did talk about books - A.N. Wilson claimed last week that Bron loathed books but I think that's unfair. He certainly had a great respect for Muriel Spark and V.S. Naipaul. But Wilson was probably right in saying that in other respects he was a total Philistine. My one attempt to expand his cultural horizons - I sent him a tape of Pulp's 'Common People' and urged him to listen to the lyrics - was an abject failure. When I asked a few weeks later if he'd listened to it, he said indignantly: \"Certainly not!\"</p> <p>I was amazed last autumn, when he was already ill, to see him at the preview of the Apocalypse exhibition at the Royal Academy. Why, I wondered, would he want to spend some of his dwindling strength on an exhibition he was bound to loathe? I could get no clues from him, but when I mentioned it to Nancy Sladek, editor of the Literary Review, she said matter of factly: 'Well he wanted to see the rude video.' Oh of course! </p> <p>When I rang round Bron's friends last Wednesday, many of them were in tears - Naim Attallah said he had been crying all day; Sladek could barely speak. Everyone knew he was very ill but still his death came as a shock.</p> <p>The first signs that he was seriously ill came last summer - he lost an awful lot of weight and then collapsed at the judging of the Literary Review poetry prize. He managed to make it to the prizegiving lunch where Muriel Spark presented the award but he was obviously not on good form and gave a rather tetchy speech. Then he wrote a Spectator Diary in which he complained that everyone kept asking if he was dying and rambled pessimistically about why anyone should ever be remembered. That column was the first sign to me that his concentration was going - he had lost the great precision and clarity of thought that normally characterised every sentence. He also gave a regrettable interview (much resented by his family) to Deborah Ross of the Independent.</p> <p>But the big shocker, for most of his friends, was the Bad Sex Awards party at the end of November when he looked terribly old and frail and retired immediately after Mick Jagger presented the award. That was his last public appearance - soon afterwards he went to hospital and then retreated to Combe Florey to die. Basically, his heart gave out, he was exhausted. He had been in fragile health, and probably in pain, for much of his adult life though he never spoke of it. On the last day, Tuesday, several of his oldest friends went down to Combe Florey to see him - A.N. Wilson and Richard Ingrams, Nancy Sladek and Sir Vidia and Lady Naipaul.</p> <p>The future of the Literary Review must now seem doubtful. Naim Attallah insists he wants it to continue, because Bron wanted it to continue. Sladek, a Czech heiress educated at Heathfield and in Switzerland, has been effectively running it for five years. But it is a loss-making venture dependent on a handful of private benefactors - Sir Tim Rice, Sir John Paul Getty, Lord Hanson - to pay the bills. Attallah supported the magazine single-handed for 14 years but lost \u00a32.4m on it and eventually asked Bron to rustle up more backers. But whether they were supporting Bron personally, or the magazine, remains to be seen. </p> <p>Naim says the magazine only loses about \u00a350,000 a year, and could break even or even make a profit if it had someone a bit more commercially clued-up than Bron in charge. But on the other hand, it never paid its contributors realistic fees - there must be many like me who were happy to write occasional pieces for Bron but would not normally thrill to the prospect of \u00a350 for a thousand words.

      "bodyText": "Quite apart from the prigs and puritans and Polly Toynbees, I imagine that people who did not know Bron - the silent majority - must have been bewildered and probably irritated by the huge media outpouring of grief that greeted his death this week. Much greater writers have died with less fanfare; I don't remember the Telegraph devoting five pages to Graham Greene's death as it did to Bron's. A friend of mine said rather sourly, 'I suppose he was the journalist's journalist' and of course, yes - that's exactly what he was. He stood for all the things that attracted me to journalism in the first place, all the things Polly Toynbee most disapproves of - long lunches and gossip and laughter and a mischievous (yes!), and above all irreverent (oh please!) response to pomposity and received opinion. Obviously you needed a sense of humour to appreciate him which is why Toynbee drew a blank - but her claim in the Guardian on Friday that he was the head of some sinister right-wing coterie was risible for those of us who know how to ris. He wrote to no agenda or party line. He did not believe it was the job of journalists to run the country or to advise politicians, but to nip at the heels of sacred cows and expose the inadequacy of the emperor's new clothes. He never pontificated about family values but he lived them, deeply. And however cruelly he wrote on occasions, he was unfailingly kind in real life. He believed that it was our duty to be happy as long as possible because tomorrow we die. He told me once: 'I'm just not prepared to be agonised by all the suffering in the world. There's no point in the world if we've all got to suffer with the suffering, because the whole point is that while some people suffer, others don't.' Hence his tireless crusade to add to the world's stock of jollity and laughter. I first met him 30 years ago when I worked for Penthouse magazine. He wrote me a fan letter having seen me on Call My Bluff; I wrote back, and after that we had regular lunches, where I would ask about books and he would ask about Penthouse. I kept expecting him to make a pass but he never did - on the contrary, he listened sympathetically to the ups and downs of my love life. He was a great listener, especially to the amatory woes of young women. He made me take him to lunch at the Penthouse Club in Shepherd's Market. I warned him he wouldn't like it but he insisted so I took him there and he was terribly upset when all the Penthouse Pets came and talked about their boyfriends and their father's new kidney machine - I think whatever fantasy he'd had about life at Penthouse died that day. We did talk about books - A.N. Wilson claimed last week that Bron loathed books but I think that's unfair. He certainly had a great respect for Muriel Spark and V.S. Naipaul. But Wilson was probably right in saying that in other respects he was a total Philistine. My one attempt to expand his cultural horizons - I sent him a tape of Pulp's 'Common People' and urged him to listen to the lyrics - was an abject failure. When I asked a few weeks later if he'd listened to it, he said indignantly: \"Certainly not!\" I was amazed last autumn, when he was already ill, to see him at the preview of the Apocalypse exhibition at the Royal Academy. Why, I wondered, would he want to spend some of his dwindling strength on an exhibition he was bound to loathe? I could get no clues from him, but when I mentioned it to Nancy Sladek, editor of the Literary Review, she said matter of factly: 'Well he wanted to see the rude video.' Oh of course! When I rang round Bron's friends last Wednesday, many of them were in tears - Naim Attallah said he had been crying all day; Sladek could barely speak. Everyone knew he was very ill but still his death came as a shock. The first signs that he was seriously ill came last summer - he lost an awful lot of weight and then collapsed at the judging of the Literary Review poetry prize. He managed to make it to the prizegiving lunch where Muriel Spark presented the award but he was obviously not on good form and gave a rather tetchy speech. Then he wrote a Spectator Diary in which he complained that everyone kept asking if he was dying and rambled pessimistically about why anyone should ever be remembered. That column was the first sign to me that his concentration was going - he had lost the great precision and clarity of thought that normally characterised every sentence. He also gave a regrettable interview (much resented by his family) to Deborah Ross of the Independent. But the big shocker, for most of his friends, was the Bad Sex Awards party at the end of November when he looked terribly old and frail and retired immediately after Mick Jagger presented the award. That was his last public appearance - soon afterwards he went to hospital and then retreated to Combe Florey to die. Basically, his heart gave out, he was exhausted. He had been in fragile health, and probably in pain, for much of his adult life though he never spoke of it. On the last day, Tuesday, several of his oldest friends went down to Combe Florey to see him - A.N. Wilson and Richard Ingrams, Nancy Sladek and Sir Vidia and Lady Naipaul. The future of the Literary Review must now seem doubtful. Naim Attallah insists he wants it to continue, because Bron wanted it to continue. Sladek, a Czech heiress educated at Heathfield and in Switzerland, has been effectively running it for five years. But it is a loss-making venture dependent on a handful of private benefactors - Sir Tim Rice, Sir John Paul Getty, Lord Hanson - to pay the bills. Attallah supported the magazine single-handed for 14 years but lost \u00a32.4m on it and eventually asked Bron to rustle up more backers. But whether they were supporting Bron personally, or the magazine, remains to be seen. Naim says the magazine only loses about \u00a350,000 a year, and could break even or even make a profit if it had someone a bit more commercially clued-up than Bron in charge. But on the other hand, it never paid its contributors realistic fees - there must be many like me who were happy to write occasional pieces for Bron but would not normally thrill to the prospect of \u00a350 for a thousand words. (I banked my cheques which was considered bad form - true devotees tore them up.) Bron's cleverness was to get enough 'name' writers to make the magazine look authoritative, while also giving great freedom to young unknown writers to try their hands at reviewing. In fact it was a wonderful showcase for new talents, and many (including our own Kate Kellaway and Laura Cumming) launched their careers there. Bron's devotion to the Literary Review puzzled some of his friends.

When he returns tomorrow evening to deliver the college's 175th anniversary talk, there will be something of a sense of a circle closing, and ironies that will not be lost on him. </p> <p>The subject of Hobsbawm's address is 'Birkbeck and the Left', but five decades ago his radical socialism almost kept him out of university life altogether. A lifelong member of the Communist Party, he suggests that he got in to academia 'under the wire'; a year later, after the Berlin Airlift in 1948, his story, he believes, would have been markedly different. As it was, partly because of his political affiliations, he did not get promotion to a professorship until 1970. </p> <p>He has never needed any lessons, however, in the virtues of playing a long game. His landmark trilogy on the nineteenth century synthesised myriad competing social swells into great epochal waves: the Ages of Revolution, and of Capital, and of Empire. He has characterised his own time and tide as the Age of Extremes, the tempestuous force of which conspired to deposit him on the shore of the present as the Last Marxist; still, he refuses to believe himself beached. One old friend observes: 'Eric has long ago worked out his precise intellectual position and he's quite happy there, thank you very much.' </p> <p>Talking to Hobsbawm now, at 83, his mind still in edgy overdrive, his body language made for compelling awkwardness, you have a strong sense of the history that he has measured on his own pulse. He was born in Alexandria to a middle-class Jewish family in the year of the October Revolution, 1917, and he has lived to see the full tragic narrative of the Bolshevik utopia unfold. It is characteristic of him that he remains sentimental about its origins, but clear-eyed over its outcome. </p> <p>Before the war, his family moved first to Vienna and then to Berlin, where Hobsbawm came of age. He says he still recognises in himself the kernel of the 14-year-old boy who read on a newspaper board the headline announcing the accession of the Third Reich. 'Anybody who saw Hitler's rise happen first-hand could not have helped but be shaped by it, politically,' he says now. 'This is still there in me. That boy is still somewhere inside, always will be.' </p> <p>Hobsbawm's parents both died during the Depression and he and his sister were taken in by his uncle, who worked for a Hollywood firm in Berlin. Almost immediately, the family moved to England, following his uncle's job, and for three years, Hobsbawm experienced what he has rarely felt since - that history was happening without him. He was bored and dislocated by the transition from the intensities of pre-war Germany to the complacencies of a south London grammar school. It was not until he got to Cambridge that he sensed he could carry on with the conversations that he'd started in Berlin. </p> <p>Hobsbawm has defined and explained the progress of the last century as mankind learning to 'live in expectation of apocalypse'. He responded to those intimations in himself by joining the Communist Party. He would, he says, certainly have become a member earlier, but that his uncle was 'rather stiff' on the subject. 'He used to say, \"You kids don't know what you are letting yourselves in for\".' Hobsbawm smiles now, seeing his life unspooling in that prophecy. 'He was right, of course.' </p> <p>You could imagine that the gangling young \u00e9migr\u00e9, uprooted and orphaned, might have been attracted to the certainties of the party as a surrogate family and consequently begin to explain the strength of the attachment as a powerfully emotional as well as an intellectual one. Looking back, he suggests that 'probably that kind of security was one of the appeals', but also that he 'never felt short of family... it was more that you just felt things were going to pieces, and you felt it needed a revolution to re-create it, to put it back together'. </p> <p>After the war, these political commitments no longer seemed quite so innocent. Hobsbawm applied for a series of Oxbridge jobs, and was 'turned down right, left and centre' He fetched up instead, happily, at Birkbeck, and found inspiration in the radicalism of J.D. Bernal, the maverick Marxist and physicist, 'by far the brightest man there, who looked like a sea captain with long, bushy hair, and who walked, as he said, like the pobble who had no toes'. In some ways, Hobsbawm still views the world as the semi-detached, cold warrior he was then, or at least the legacy of that rhetoric continues to inflect his memories. 'Of course, physics tended to be very Left,' he will say, recalling old common-room divides, 'and obviously so did crystallography'; or, speaking, of one mathematician colleague: 'I'm not sure if he didn't become a Maoist at about that time...' </p> <p>One of his friends of that era at Birkbeck, Barbara Hardy, now Professor of English, remembers Hobsbawm in his late thirties, as 'very sexy and amusing, and wonderfully candid'. Lectures at Birkbeck, whose student body is part-time, are in the evenings and the challenge among the faculty was to keep its audience awake in the graveyard slot between eight and nine. Hobsbawm, by all accounts, achieved this effortlessly and sustained his intellectual energy after hours. 'When Eric was around there was always conversation,' recalls Hardy, suggesting that so much sherry was drunk in those days that she can now no longer look a glass of it in the eye. </p> <p>There would be sudden jaunts to Ronnie Scott's (Hobsbawm was at the time an impassioned jazz critic for the New Statesman) or on, one occasion, she recalls, to listen to Billy Graham. 'Eric always wanted to be seeing something new,' she says, 'or to know something new. He was always fully engaged.' </p> <p>Throughout this period, Hobsbawm maintained his commitment to communism, a fact which some of his colleagues, including Hardy, found, at best, mysterious. Though he never proselytised unlike many of his comrades, Hobsbawm did not leave the party after 1956. His concession was to argue that even the most monolithic members had, given events, to 'reconsider the equation: party = life'. </p> <p>Hobsbawm appears to have resolved that equation for himself in part by pursuing a more limited kind of personal utopia. His standing in Central Europe and Latin America as an 'important revisionist' allowed him the freedom to travel and establish a network of friends, who later became regular visitors to his home on the flanks of Hampstead Heath. There were - are - dinners at which British intellectuals could find themselves outnumbered by German publishers, Czech historians and Latin American novelists. The driving force of north London's most distinctive Central European salon is Marlene, Hobsbawm's second wife, who, friends say, 'provides this remarkable gregarious atmosphere around him'. One regular recipient of this hospitality, Neal Ascherson, says: 'Eric is still very much a Fifties bohemian, in a way. He loves, say, the idea of some weird drink brought back from Slobodnia in an odd -shaped bottle. You have to watch yourself or you are falling over before the food arrives.' </p> <p>In part, this stubborn microcosm of conviviality explains why Hobsbawm has kept the faith. As the walls were coming down in 1989, Hobsbawm was often asked to explain his continued commitment. Typically, he replied both as a conviction historian - 'I think the movement has achieved at least one absolutely major thing, and that includes the Soviet Union, namely the defeat of fascism,' - and as a rose-tinted loyalist: 'I don't wish to be untrue to my past or comrades of mine, a lot of them dead, some of them killed by their own side, whom I've admired [as] models to follow, in their unselfishness.' </p> <p>The end of the Cold War and the new public relations-led world order that followed brought to a close Hobsbawm's particular influence over more domestic battles, too. In the Eighties, he had become the unofficial philosopher and intellectual conscience of the Labour Party as it fought for its soul and its future under Michael Foot and Neil Kinnock. But if he despairs of the present government, he tends to keep his counsel or employs a Zhou Enlai defence that it is 'too early to tell'. Though he concedes that Blair's populist anti-intellectualism 'gets on his wick', he can laugh when he says he 'finds it hard to envisage not voting Labour, put it that way'. </p> <p>If Hobsbawm is saddened by the way things have turned out, he has enough professional detachment not to let it show. Having lived to tell the lucid tales of the past two centuries, he approaches the new one, the subject of his most recent, prophetic, book, with few grounds for optimism, but with great vigour. One of the antidotes to discontent for Hobsbawm has always been industry and he shows no signs of slacking. He regrets that recently he has had to cut back on his globetrotting - only 'a few trips to Europe and South America' - in order to concentrate on writing his autobiography. He hopes, he says, with some understatement, that it will describe 'different countries, what I know of 'em, how I got to know 'em, that kind of stuff'. Though he'll never make a blurb writer, you guess that, for some at least, it will be the essential Baedeker to the century.</p>",

      "body": "<p>What is the true story of a life? Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, the man who for many is the greatest living storyteller, has always understood that fantasy is a big part of the way we explain what happens to us. Up until now, though, Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's hands have been firmly on the reins of his own stories. True, he introduced the anarchic concept of 'magic realism' with his novels Love in the Time of Cholera and One Hundred Years of Solitude , but his surreal imagery just served to underline who was in charge.</p> <p>In the past few weeks, however, a story has slipped away from the great man's control. An email has been circulating the English-speaking world which claims to contain his final words of farewell to his readers. A short letter accompanied by several plausible lines of lyrical verse has had Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez fans across the globe convinced that he was speaking to them for the last time.</p> <p>'This is possibly, sadly, one of the last gifts to humanity from a true master,' the introductory note read, going on to claim that the 'truly moving' email had been sent out to the author's closest friends in its original Spanish.</p> <p>It was already known that the Nobel Laureate had been ill for some months with cancer and that he was writing in private. The disease had first been diagnosed in July 1999 when he was admitted to hospital in his native Colombia, suffering from exhaustion. As a result, for many recipients the finality of the words in the email seemed apt and rather beautiful.</p> <p>'If for an instant God were to forget that I am rag doll and gifted me with a piece of life,' it read, 'possibly I wouldn't say all that I think, but rather I would think of all that I say. I would value things, not for their worth but for what they mean. I would sleep little, dream more, understanding that for each minute we close our eyes we lose 60 seconds of light.'</p> <p>In a further effort to convince, the valedictory lines went on to mention a Latin American poet, Benedetti from Uruguay, and the popular Catalan singer, Serrat. It ended with the words: 'I have learnt that a man has the right to look down on another only when he has to help the other get to his feet. From you I have learnt so many things, but in truth they won't be of much use, for when I keep them within this suitcase, unhappily shall I be dying.'</p> <p>The writer has now denied authorship of the email through his Spanish agent, but rumours of his ill-health have persisted. Why has he been closeted in his Mexican home for so long, and what can we expect to hear of him next?</p> <p>The Observer can reveal that Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez has been writing the definitive work of his life - and it has much more of the intellectual flavour and dry humour of his previous work than the email. The new project is an autobiography and its theme is the way we mis-remember and re-tell our own stories. In it, using a liberal dose of hokum and his own brand of special effects, Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez sets out a version of his life for readers to remember him by.</p> <p>'From what I have seen, this is going to be very funny and fascinating. But it should be taken with a pinch of salt,' said Michael Wood of Princeton University, the author of a book on Love in the Time of Cholera. 'It has all his usual exaggerations, and it should perhaps be viewed as a study of the way we all mythologise our family histories.'</p> <p>The tricks that memory plays, the writer argues, actually shape our lives. 'What matters in life is not what happens to you but what you remember and how you remember it,' Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez writes at the opening of his personal account.</p> <p>Further on he demonstrates the point with an anecdote.

      "bodyText": "What is the true story of a life? Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, the man who for many is the greatest living storyteller, has always understood that fantasy is a big part of the way we explain what happens to us. Up until now, though, Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's hands have been firmly on the reins of his own stories. True, he introduced the anarchic concept of 'magic realism' with his novels Love in the Time of Cholera and One Hundred Years of Solitude , but his surreal imagery just served to underline who was in charge. In the past few weeks, however, a story has slipped away from the great man's control. An email has been circulating the English-speaking world which claims to contain his final words of farewell to his readers. A short letter accompanied by several plausible lines of lyrical verse has had Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez fans across the globe convinced that he was speaking to them for the last time. 'This is possibly, sadly, one of the last gifts to humanity from a true master,' the introductory note read, going on to claim that the 'truly moving' email had been sent out to the author's closest friends in its original Spanish. It was already known that the Nobel Laureate had been ill for some months with cancer and that he was writing in private. The disease had first been diagnosed in July 1999 when he was admitted to hospital in his native Colombia, suffering from exhaustion. As a result, for many recipients the finality of the words in the email seemed apt and rather beautiful. 'If for an instant God were to forget that I am rag doll and gifted me with a piece of life,' it read, 'possibly I wouldn't say all that I think, but rather I would think of all that I say. I would value things, not for their worth but for what they mean. I would sleep little, dream more, understanding that for each minute we close our eyes we lose 60 seconds of light.' In a further effort to convince, the valedictory lines went on to mention a Latin American poet, Benedetti from Uruguay, and the popular Catalan singer, Serrat. It ended with the words: 'I have learnt that a man has the right to look down on another only when he has to help the other get to his feet. From you I have learnt so many things, but in truth they won't be of much use, for when I keep them within this suitcase, unhappily shall I be dying.' The writer has now denied authorship of the email through his Spanish agent, but rumours of his ill-health have persisted. Why has he been closeted in his Mexican home for so long, and what can we expect to hear of him next? The Observer can reveal that Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez has been writing the definitive work of his life - and it has much more of the intellectual flavour and dry humour of his previous work than the email. The new project is an autobiography and its theme is the way we mis-remember and re-tell our own stories. In it, using a liberal dose of hokum and his own brand of special effects, Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez sets out a version of his life for readers to remember him by. 'From what I have seen, this is going to be very funny and fascinating. But it should be taken with a pinch of salt,' said Michael Wood of Princeton University, the author of a book on Love in the Time of Cholera. 'It has all his usual exaggerations, and it should perhaps be viewed as a study of the way we all mythologise our family histories.' The tricks that memory plays, the writer argues, actually shape our lives. 'What matters in life is not what happens to you but what you remember and how you remember it,' Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez writes at the opening of his personal account. Further on he demonstrates the point with an anecdote. He says that when his parents were married in 1926, his mother yearned for the little telegraph office house where she had spent her honeymoon. Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez says he and his brothers and sisters were soon able to describe it 'room by room as if they had lived there'. As he approached the age of 60, the writer finally travelled to the place to look at the house and found it 'was not at all like the one in my memory at all'. All the same, today he can 'never visualise it as it is, but rather as I constructed it, stone by stone, without seeing it, through my mother's nostalgia'. The phoney farewell email, now thought to have been penned by an American prankster, does not stand up to comparison with these fresh passages from a master. 'Personally I was not convinced by the email, which people have been sending me for some while,' said Wood. The real work of the 73-year-old author, as he draws towards the end of his life, is far more playful. Even the title of the new story, To Live So I Could Tell, gently teases the reader. 'This has at least three possible meanings,' says Wood. 'In one sense it means that he has survived and so he can tell; in another it means that he has lived only for telling stories. But, of course, it also means that he is now continuing to live simply to write this book.' The work begins by telling the 'real' story that inspired Love in the Time of Cholera - the tale of how his socially unequal parents courted and eventually married. 'It tells the same tale, in a fanciful way again, but this time they don't have to wait for most of their lives before they can get together.' All the dates and names in this autobiography seem to be correct, however, and Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez scholars can look forward to a factual record of the life of the author who befriended many statesmen, including Fidel Castro and Bill Clinton, as well as winning the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1982. While the completed autobiography is likely to prove a more accurate historical document than the fake email that fooled so many, fans can rest assured that Marquez's own version of his life will still contain some bright red herrings. His real words ... and the fake farewell: From the genuine forthcoming autobiography 'What matters in life is not what happens to you but what you remember and how you remember it.' From the hoax email 'If for an instant God were to forget that I am rag doll and gifted me with a piece of life, possibly I wouldn't say all that I think, but rather I would think of all that I say. I would value things, not for their worth but for what they mean. I would sleep little, dream more, understanding that for each minute we close our eyes we lose sixty seconds of light. 'I would walk when others hold back, I would wake when others sleep. I would listen when others talk, and how I would enjoy a good chocolate ice cream! If God were to give me a piece of life, I would dress simply, throw myself face first into the sun, baring not only my body but also my soul. My God, if I had a heart, I would write my hate on ice, and wait for the sun to show. Over the stars I would paint with a Van Gogh dream a Benedetti poem, and a Serrat song would be the serenade I'd offer to the moon.' vanessa.thorpe@observer.co.uk",

      "body": "<p>The farmers and their brave pickers are still managing to find us something worth eating in the freezing mud. Even now they are coming up with vegetables in good nick, as anyone who has been to market in the last week or so cannot have missed. Fabulous kale, its frilly leaves deep green or mauve; crisp and juicy carrots; stonking parsnips that roast sweetly, and Brussels sprouts, still small and tight despite the heavy rain that usually bloats them, are all there for the taking. It would be crazy to pass up such cracking stuff for a plastic tray of Zimbabwean mangetout. </p> <p>The fishermen are netting good things for us, too, though understandably at a price. I pay up gladly, in the knowledge that nothing would get me on a boat in January unless it was packed to the gills with obliging stewards and merry widows bound for the Caribbean. Anyone who can fill a fishmonger's slab at this time of year deserves a big hand. Fat scallops, shimmering mackerel and some memorable Manx kippers have all ended up on my table this week - though I could also have had a bit of lemon sole, and the halibut looked just as tempting. </p> <p>I spotted a box of fresh sea lettuce at Borough Market (near London Bridge station, SE1) last Saturday and pounced on it. I have been slowly but surely developing a taste for this and other seaweeds. A worrying trend, but there you are. If the thought of all that calcium, iron, magnesium and vitamins A and B are not enough to tempt (and they aren't), I should mention that much of it has a pleasing, silky feel in the mouth. Emerald-green sea lettuce ( Ulva lactua ) and ruby-red dulse ( Palmaria palmata ) are the most palatable 'sea vegetables' for the first-timer. The aptly named sea spaghetti ( Himanthalia elongata ) is for me still too reminiscent of the stuff one or other of my brothers used to chase me round the beach at Bournemouth with. </p> <p>Think of these fresh, lightly salted seaweeds as brightly coloured spring greens with a faint taste of the North Sea. I make a soup that involves nothing more than adding a small handful of soaked and shredded sea lettuce or dulse to a bowl of steaming vegetable stock. It cooks in a minute. Seasoned only with pepper and plenty of lemon juice, it makes a clean-tasting and mildly invigorating lunch. </p> <p>Soup is big right now - witness the soup shops opening up in the high street and the newfangled packaging in the supermarket chiller (tins are so yesterday). Warming bowl of the month must surely be artichoke. The knobbly pink Jerusalems around at the moment will, when simmered for half an hour with a little stock then blitzed in a blender, produce a velvet-textured broth of the finest Armani beige. Season it with lemon juice and lots of finely chopped spanking-fresh parsley. It is worth remembering that the red variety tend to be less sweet. </p> <p>This is not the time for fresh herbs, but rosemary is still proud and, even without the sunshine that herbs need so badly, is surprisingly fragrant. A robust weekday supper might be some mature lamb chops with olive oil, well-crushed garlic and a crumbling of rosemary leaves, grilled till the fat has charred here and there. If you cannot face peeling potatoes to go with them when you come home, then try whizzing drained tinned chickpeas in the food processor with a little olive oil and a pinch of paprika. Hardly winter food - such ingredients reek of summer - but you can have one stew too many, if you ask me. </p> <p>Pulses is not a word that lifts the spirits, but this is dried-bean weather, to be sure. I found whole broad beans the other day and made a winter salad by soaking them overnight then boiling them till they were completely tender (a good 40 minutes), then popping them from their skins. I dressed them while they were still warm with a mustardy French dressing, then stirred in some soured cream and chopped flat-leaf parsley and ate them piled it in big, lumpy spoonfuls on to soft ciabatta. </p> <p>I almost dare not say the word salad, especially with most of the decent leaves coming in from elsewhere right now, but somehow I still want something leafy on a big white plate every evening. Simple salads don't have to be green. It is just that we tend to think of them that way. Red trevise or, more correctly, rosso di Treviso, is an exquisitely hued chicory of burgundy and cream, and has been in my salad twice this week, along with some earthy-tasting carmine-veined baby chard. It is not hard to find and has a tenderness about it that makes a change from the surfeit of rustic crunch we have been given to eating over the last months. </p> <p>Winter always sees me making dressings that have a bit more punch to them. The mustard pot comes out more regularly and I often use a bit more vinegar, too, but this is also the time of year I crumble up salty blue cheeses such as Roquefort or Spanish Picos de Europa into crunch salads such as those with white leaves. Anyone for a crunchy chicory, walnut and blue-cheese salad with a thick and creamy, mustardy dressing? </p> <p>Cheeses for January still include the voluptuous Vacherin in its wooden box. Molton curds hide under its golden crust, as if this cheese was secretly trying to turn itself into soup. Never has that well-worn line 'Serve with a piece of crusty bread' been quite so appropriate. But there's more. Many of the artisan-made British cheeses are eating well right now. Mrs Appleby's Cheshire - so mild, so nutty - and just the thing to go with the last of nuts in the fruit bowl is as good now as I have ever tasted it. </p> <p>The food fashionistas decree that shaving Parmesan over your salad is a no-no, but what would they know about good eating? Try, if you will, the lovely pale English Tyning instead (Neal's Yard will do it by mail order - call 0161 831 7875). It has a similar texture to a young Pecorino or Parmesan, but with a milkier, fresher taste. Best salad of the week was the one in which I pared wafer-thin slices of Tyning with a vegetable peeler and tossed them with watercress, equally thin slices of smooth white fennel, and lots of coarsely chopped parsley with a textbook vinaigrette (5 parts oil to 1 part vinegar, a little salt, pepper and mustard). Winter at its freshest. </p> <p>The other morning (icy wind, frost on the hedges), I suddenly had an uncontrollable urge for a kipper. I will occasionally let slip my personal boycott against anything from the Isle of Man just to get a taste of its mild and moist smoked herring. Manx kippers are undyed and have a golden-brown glow rather than the Belisha-beacon orange of the boil-in-the-bag supermarket variety. You can cook them head down in a big jug of boiled water, but I grilled mine briefly instead, with pepper and a judicious bathing of butter. It is a once-a-year thing, this kipper urge, and I sometimes think the reason I don't cook them more often is simply the boarding-house breakfast pong that lingers on the stairs afterwards like the family spook. </p> <p>Clear the air with a bowl of poached sweet-sharp rhubarb. Along with gooseberries and damsons, it is the fruit I look forward to most. There is no easier fruit to prepare: just chop the fine pale-pink stems into cork-sized lengths and pack them into a baking dish with the juice of an orange or two and a fine sprinkling of sugar. You really don't need much with the tender rose stems, and bake in a moderate oven for 20 minutes or so till it is soft and syrupy. There will tons of exquisite juice to sup, too. If you have never had it cold, try it chilled for breakfast without yogurt, cream or extra sugar. A startling and rather effective alarm call. </p> <p>The doorstep drop of food companies anxious to plug their products has actually turned up a few goodies this month. Namely some stunning chutney from <a href=\"http://www.tamarindfinefoods.co.uk\">Tamarind</a>. Unlike most commercial glops-in-a-jar, these are bright tasting and with an unsullied ingredient list. Check out the Tomato and cardamom and Carrot and Raisin for their clean, sweet flavours and up-front spice. The Date and chilli is deliciously dark and smoky. I stirred the tomato and carrot varieties into a bowl of plain boiled basmati for a spare and gentle supper. I should admit that this sucker also fell for the neat packaging. </p> <p>Now if you don't fancy the artichokes I mentioned as a soup, then try them baked instead: you will need 500g or so of artichokes, about 12, and remember to give them a good scrub with a vegetable brush. Boil them in salted water for 15-20 minutes until they are almost tender. Drain and scrape off as much of the skin as you reasonably can, then slice thickly. Generously butter a small gratin dish and lay the artichokes in it, pouring in just enough stock (vegetable, chicken or even something from a cube) to come just over halfway up the slices. Season with a squeeze of lemon juice, some salt and black pepper - I also tuck in a bay leaf or two - then bake the artichokes for 30 minutes at 390 C/gas mark 5 until completely tender. Now slide your dish out of the oven and scatter with a thin layer of grated Parmesan, turn up the oven to 200 C/gas mark 6 and let them cook for a further 15 minutes or so till they are lightly crusted and blissfully soft within. Eat them, spooning the baking juices over, with cold ham or rare roast beef. Enough for 4 as a side dish.</p>",

Fabulous kale, its frilly leaves deep green or mauve; crisp and juicy carrots; stonking parsnips that roast sweetly, and Brussels sprouts, still small and tight despite the heavy rain that usually bloats them, are all there for the taking. It would be crazy to pass up such cracking stuff for a plastic tray of Zimbabwean mangetout. The fishermen are netting good things for us, too, though understandably at a price. I pay up gladly, in the knowledge that nothing would get me on a boat in January unless it was packed to the gills with obliging stewards and merry widows bound for the Caribbean. Anyone who can fill a fishmonger's slab at this time of year deserves a big hand. Fat scallops, shimmering mackerel and some memorable Manx kippers have all ended up on my table this week - though I could also have had a bit of lemon sole, and the halibut looked just as tempting. I spotted a box of fresh sea lettuce at Borough Market (near London Bridge station, SE1) last Saturday and pounced on it. I have been slowly but surely developing a taste for this and other seaweeds. A worrying trend, but there you are. If the thought of all that calcium, iron, magnesium and vitamins A and B are not enough to tempt (and they aren't), I should mention that much of it has a pleasing, silky feel in the mouth. Emerald-green sea lettuce ( Ulva lactua ) and ruby-red dulse ( Palmaria palmata ) are the most palatable 'sea vegetables' for the first-timer. The aptly named sea spaghetti ( Himanthalia elongata ) is for me still too reminiscent of the stuff one or other of my brothers used to chase me round the beach at Bournemouth with. Think of these fresh, lightly salted seaweeds as brightly coloured spring greens with a faint taste of the North Sea. I make a soup that involves nothing more than adding a small handful of soaked and shredded sea lettuce or dulse to a bowl of steaming vegetable stock. It cooks in a minute. Seasoned only with pepper and plenty of lemon juice, it makes a clean-tasting and mildly invigorating lunch. Soup is big right now - witness the soup shops opening up in the high street and the newfangled packaging in the supermarket chiller (tins are so yesterday). Warming bowl of the month must surely be artichoke. The knobbly pink Jerusalems around at the moment will, when simmered for half an hour with a little stock then blitzed in a blender, produce a velvet-textured broth of the finest Armani beige. Season it with lemon juice and lots of finely chopped spanking-fresh parsley. It is worth remembering that the red variety tend to be less sweet. This is not the time for fresh herbs, but rosemary is still proud and, even without the sunshine that herbs need so badly, is surprisingly fragrant. A robust weekday supper might be some mature lamb chops with olive oil, well-crushed garlic and a crumbling of rosemary leaves, grilled till the fat has charred here and there. If you cannot face peeling potatoes to go with them when you come home, then try whizzing drained tinned chickpeas in the food processor with a little olive oil and a pinch of paprika. Hardly winter food - such ingredients reek of summer - but you can have one stew too many, if you ask me. Pulses is not a word that lifts the spirits, but this is dried-bean weather, to be sure. I found whole broad beans the other day and made a winter salad by soaking them overnight then boiling them till they were completely tender (a good 40 minutes), then popping them from their skins. I dressed them while they were still warm with a mustardy French dressing, then stirred in some soured cream and chopped flat-leaf parsley and ate them piled it in big, lumpy spoonfuls on to soft ciabatta. I almost dare not say the word salad, especially with most of the decent leaves coming in from elsewhere right now, but somehow I still want something leafy on a big white plate every evening. Simple salads don't have to be green. It is just that we tend to think of them that way. Red trevise or, more correctly, rosso di Treviso, is an exquisitely hued chicory of burgundy and cream, and has been in my salad twice this week, along with some earthy-tasting carmine-veined baby chard. It is not hard to find and has a tenderness about it that makes a change from the surfeit of rustic crunch we have been given to eating over the last months. Winter always sees me making dressings that have a bit more punch to them. The mustard pot comes out more regularly and I often use a bit more vinegar, too, but this is also the time of year I crumble up salty blue cheeses such as Roquefort or Spanish Picos de Europa into crunch salads such as those with white leaves. Anyone for a crunchy chicory, walnut and blue-cheese salad with a thick and creamy, mustardy dressing? Cheeses for January still include the voluptuous Vacherin in its wooden box. Molton curds hide under its golden crust, as if this cheese was secretly trying to turn itself into soup. Never has that well-worn line 'Serve with a piece of crusty bread' been quite so appropriate. But there's more. Many of the artisan-made British cheeses are eating well right now. Mrs Appleby's Cheshire - so mild, so nutty - and just the thing to go with the last of nuts in the fruit bowl is as good now as I have ever tasted it. The food fashionistas decree that shaving Parmesan over your salad is a no-no, but what would they know about good eating? Try, if you will, the lovely pale English Tyning instead (Neal's Yard will do it by mail order - call 0161 831 7875). It has a similar texture to a young Pecorino or Parmesan, but with a milkier, fresher taste. Best salad of the week was the one in which I pared wafer-thin slices of Tyning with a vegetable peeler and tossed them with watercress, equally thin slices of smooth white fennel, and lots of coarsely chopped parsley with a textbook vinaigrette (5 parts oil to 1 part vinegar, a little salt, pepper and mustard). Winter at its freshest. The other morning (icy wind, frost on the hedges), I suddenly had an uncontrollable urge for a kipper. I will occasionally let slip my personal boycott against anything from the Isle of Man just to get a taste of its mild and moist smoked herring. Manx kippers are undyed and have a golden-brown glow rather than the Belisha-beacon orange of the boil-in-the-bag supermarket variety. You can cook them head down in a big jug of boiled water, but I grilled mine briefly instead, with pepper and a judicious bathing of butter. It is a once-a-year thing, this kipper urge, and I sometimes think the reason I don't cook them more often is simply the boarding-house breakfast pong that lingers on the stairs afterwards like the family spook. Clear the air with a bowl of poached sweet-sharp rhubarb. Along with gooseberries and damsons, it is the fruit I look forward to most. There is no easier fruit to prepare: just chop the fine pale-pink stems into cork-sized lengths and pack them into a baking dish with the juice of an orange or two and a fine sprinkling of sugar. You really don't need much with the tender rose stems, and bake in a moderate oven for 20 minutes or so till it is soft and syrupy. There will tons of exquisite juice to sup, too. If you have never had it cold, try it chilled for breakfast without yogurt, cream or extra sugar. A startling and rather effective alarm call. The doorstep drop of food companies anxious to plug their products has actually turned up a few goodies this month. Namely some stunning chutney from Tamarind. Unlike most commercial glops-in-a-jar, these are bright tasting and with an unsullied ingredient list. Check out the Tomato and cardamom and Carrot and Raisin for their clean, sweet flavours and up-front spice. The Date and chilli is deliciously dark and smoky. I stirred the tomato and carrot varieties into a bowl of plain boiled basmati for a spare and gentle supper. I should admit that this sucker also fell for the neat packaging. Now if you don't fancy the artichokes I mentioned as a soup, then try them baked instead: you will need 500g or so of artichokes, about 12, and remember to give them a good scrub with a vegetable brush. Boil them in salted water for 15-20 minutes until they are almost tender. Drain and scrape off as much of the skin as you reasonably can, then slice thickly. Generously butter a small gratin dish and lay the artichokes in it, pouring in just enough stock (vegetable, chicken or even something from a cube) to come just over halfway up the slices. Season with a squeeze of lemon juice, some salt and black pepper - I also tuck in a bay leaf or two - then bake the artichokes for 30 minutes at 390 C/gas mark 5 until completely tender. Now slide your dish out of the oven and scatter with a thin layer of grated Parmesan, turn up the oven to 200 C/gas mark 6 and let them cook for a further 15 minutes or so till they are lightly crusted and blissfully soft within. Eat them, spooning the baking juices over, with cold ham or rare roast beef. Enough for 4 as a side dish.",

It did not trouble me that, at some point in their development, most or all of those tests were tried on animals.

But then companies which experiment on animals, however important they are to our science base and, in turn, our greater wellbeing, do not play brilliantly with certain elements of the public. HLS has been begging for help for months but it was only as the bailiffs were practically banging on the doors, that Whitehall took notice. </p> <p>Part of the problem is Labour's historical relationship with the animal rights lobby, a movement which eschews intellectual argument in favour of the kind of treacle sentiment which has kept Hallmark greetings cards in business for so long. Eighteen years in opposition made Labour a rallying point for every shabby oppositionist cause going. Some have been hard to shake off. </p> <p>For example, while representatives of the animal rights movement have managed to get meetings with Home Office Ministers to state their position, Andrew Blake, director of Seriously Ill for Medical Research, which argues the case of the sick and disabled for animal experimentation to help in the search for cures, has been rebuffed at every turn. 'They're just listening to the anti-vivisectionists,' Blake told me last week, 'and not the patients.' </p> <p>If you wanted further proof of how confused New Labour is on this, you could find it last week in the chamber of the House of Commons where a ban on hunting was being debated. As the DTI was arguing the case for the supremacy of man over animals with the banks, every single DTI Minister who was in the House - including Stephen Byers - was voting for a ban on hunting. </p> <p>Personally, I find hunting distasteful. On balance, I would prefer to live in a country where people did not feel the need to dress up and ride with snapping hounds specifically to rid the countryside of vermin. But my objection is, as I say, purely a matter of taste and that is not a good enough reason for legislating. </p> <p>Funnily enough, two years ago the Government appeared to agree. In March 1998, Jack Straw was asked whether New Labour would be introducing a bill banning hunting. 'We do not have a mandate for it,' the Home Secretary replied, simply. 'I do not see a role for Government.' Mind you, in March 1998 no election was pending. </p> <p>But even if there were a case for banning fox hunting there are many more important pieces of legislation which should be introduced first, such as, say, a fully functioning Freedom of Information bill. The Government clearly thought otherwise: last autumn it used a guillotine to curtail debate on the already neutered proposals, declaring a lack of parliamentary time. </p> <p>They gave the same reason for guillotining the Countryside Bill and the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Bill. And yet - somehow - they still found time for last week's free vote on hunting despite the issue having already had one run as a Private Member's Bill. And don't even mention the fact that it will never make it on to the statute books because of that pending election. At least it showed the punters that Labour's bleeding heart is in the right place. </p> <p>Because, as far as this Government is concerned, the art of statecraft means tapping into the emotions of the electorate, however dysfunctional they may be and however poor the governance that results. Last week a number of newspapers - excluding this one - published photographs of bodies laid out in the chapel of rest at Bedford Hospital. The mortuary was full. The temporary mortuary had broken down. And so, on a freezing winter's day with temperatures hovering around zero, the management decided to place bodies in the chapel of rest. It seems to me a perfectly reasonable thing to do. </p> <p>The disturbed ones are those who took the photographs and the newspaper editors who, like travelling circuses displaying specimens of two-headed lambs, ran those pictures across their front pages screaming: isn't this a disgrace! </p> <p>No, it isn't. Last week, in a major survey by the new medical website, <a href=\"http://www.drfoster.com\">Dr Foster</a>, whose findings were accepted by the Government, Bedford hospital rated highly. Mortality rates there are 14 per cent below the national average. Ken Williams, the chief executive, must take some credit for that success. Instead, Health Minister Alan Milburn sniffed the air, sensed the mood and hung him out to dry. 'This was not a cash problem in the hospital,' he told the Commons. 'It was a management problem.' Williams resigned and a hospital lost a successful manager. </p> <p>We are quick to damn the NHS in the media and often too slow to praise, but the paediatric department of King's College Hospital in South London did me and mine proud last week. They were concerned and efficient. What troubles me is that a Government too addicted to the caprices of public sentiment will, in trying to follow it, only make the jobs of hard-pressed doctors and nurses harder still. That kind of politics does nobody - not my family, not yours - any favours at all.</p>",

On balance, I would prefer to live in a country where people did not feel the need to dress up and ride with snapping hounds specifically to rid the countryside of vermin. But my objection is, as I say, purely a matter of taste and that is not a good enough reason for legislating. Funnily enough, two years ago the Government appeared to agree. In March 1998, Jack Straw was asked whether New Labour would be introducing a bill banning hunting. 'We do not have a mandate for it,' the Home Secretary replied, simply. 'I do not see a role for Government.' Mind you, in March 1998 no election was pending. But even if there were a case for banning fox hunting there are many more important pieces of legislation which should be introduced first, such as, say, a fully functioning Freedom of Information bill. The Government clearly thought otherwise: last autumn it used a guillotine to curtail debate on the already neutered proposals, declaring a lack of parliamentary time. They gave the same reason for guillotining the Countryside Bill and the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Bill. And yet - somehow - they still found time for last week's free vote on hunting despite the issue having already had one run as a Private Member's Bill. And don't even mention the fact that it will never make it on to the statute books because of that pending election. At least it showed the punters that Labour's bleeding heart is in the right place. Because, as far as this Government is concerned, the art of statecraft means tapping into the emotions of the electorate, however dysfunctional they may be and however poor the governance that results. Last week a number of newspapers - excluding this one - published photographs of bodies laid out in the chapel of rest at Bedford Hospital. The mortuary was full. The temporary mortuary had broken down. And so, on a freezing winter's day with temperatures hovering around zero, the management decided to place bodies in the chapel of rest. It seems to me a perfectly reasonable thing to do. The disturbed ones are those who took the photographs and the newspaper editors who, like travelling circuses displaying specimens of two-headed lambs, ran those pictures across their front pages screaming: isn't this a disgrace! No, it isn't. Last week, in a major survey by the new medical website, Dr Foster, whose findings were accepted by the Government, Bedford hospital rated highly. Mortality rates there are 14 per cent below the national average. Ken Williams, the chief executive, must take some credit for that success. Instead, Health Minister Alan Milburn sniffed the air, sensed the mood and hung him out to dry. 'This was not a cash problem in the hospital,' he told the Commons. 'It was a management problem.' Williams resigned and a hospital lost a successful manager. We are quick to damn the NHS in the media and often too slow to praise, but the paediatric department of King's College Hospital in South London did me and mine proud last week. They were concerned and efficient. What troubles me is that a Government too addicted to the caprices of public sentiment will, in trying to follow it, only make the jobs of hard-pressed doctors and nurses harder still. That kind of politics does nobody - not my family, not yours - any favours at all.",

      "body": "<p>In the penultimate column of this mini-series on transforming the muddy agonies of global warming into the ecstasies of a finely orchestrated (organic) garden, we arrive at bulbs and annuals. When you write a general, catch-all garden book, there is always a process during the proposal, treatment and synopsis when the garden is broken down into its constituent parts. These parts never quite square with the garden out the window. I don't know about your garden, but in my own, a narrow sweep of the eye will take in just about the whole range of expertise necessary to make the thing work as I want it to. Most cultivated areas have bulbs, perennials, shrubs and annuals growing shoulder to shoulder. So the usual subdivisions of shrubs/perennials/veg/top fruit/bulbs/annuals, etc is never really adequate. I apologise for the way that the last few pieces on these pages have been divided up and promise I will try to resist doing it again, here or elsewhere. But it's too late to turn back now.</p> <p>Let's do bulbs first. As a rule, bulbs are not suited to wet or even damp, poorly drained soil. The standard advice, if you are planting bulbs on heavy ground, is to put some grit in first, so they do not have their bases sitting in wet for any length of time. But there are, predictably, exceptions to this rule and our damp, heavy soil has not stopped us planting lots of tulips, alliums, hyacinths or lilies, of which we lose very few. I suspect that is because we also add masses of compost to the ground so that the soil structure is good and open, but it also makes sense to concentrate on bulbs that will cope naturally with wet conditions. </p> <p>The first ones to use are snowdrops, which are now just coming into their prime. Snowdrops not only prefer damp conditions but also need them to thrive, so they should never be planted around a large beech tree or holly, which will suck a lot of moisture from the ground and also shade it from rainfall. It is an oft-repeated piece of advice, but if you are new to snowdrops, they are best spread 'in the green' - which means digging a clump up and dividing it thinly, while they are still in flower or just after. They can, of course, be planted as bulbs, but they are very small and fiddly and you will have a much better success rate if you get hold of some now and establish them as plants.</p> <p>The other common bulb that actually likes damp conditions is the fritillary. There are more than 100 different fritillaries, but the face we instantly put to the name is the snake's head fritillary, Fritillaria meleagris. This, as if you didn't know, has beautifully sinister drooping flower bells hanging from the thinnest of stems, looking as though a chequerboard has been smudged on to the delicate petals, coloured from pale pink to a dark, chocolate burgundy. They were once a fairly common wildflower, growing in great swathes in water meadows and damp hay fields across the country. But thanks to the brutal rhythm of modern agriculture, they have all but disappeared. Blame politicians, farmers and yourself for not caring enough to do anything about it. Now, far more grow in damp corners of gardens than the fields that once shimmered with them for a few magical weeks in spring. </p> <p>The huge imperial fritillary does best in a rich clay loam that will hold moisture - so the kind of increased wet we are experiencing means this is precisely the kind of plant that will start to do well in drier, sandy or chalky soils that would not have been suitable for it before. Whatever the soil, they need lots of goodness and should be lifted every few years and the soil reinvigorated with a bucket of compost before replanting. I must do mine.</p> <p>The summer snowflake, Leucojum aestivum, is another wet-happy bulb, although ours seem to be growing perfectly happily in the dry shade of a large hazel. Looking like monstrous snowdrops, they're at their best in April, are very easy, and grow just as well in grass as in a border. </p> <p>I have never knowingly done anything to ours except plant them. Christopher Lloyd recommends planting them at the base of dogwood and I think I will try that.</p> <p>The yellow flag iris, Iris pseudacorus, is really a bog or marginal plant, so does not fall within this brief, but Iris versicolor will grow in moist soil as well as the margins of a pond. I laevigata is also happiest under water, but is useful for the wettest parts of the garden, varying from full-on bog to fire-baked rubble. Iris sibirica is one of my favourites and we grow this in a border without any problems. But it would probably be happiest in a distinctly damp spot. The leaves can fall all over the place after flowering, so it is a good idea to plant close up around it and tie or prop it up to keep the leaves contained. I chrysographes is another that thrives in the damp. I have a note from Chelsea two years ago marvelling at its astonishing depth of dark and urging myself to get some instantly. I still have not done so.</p> <p>Lilies are good for moist ground but are tricky, because although they like summer wet, they do prefer to be drier in winter when they are dormant, otherwise they can rot. What all lilies need is good drainage combined with open, moisture-retentive soil. Leaf mould and compost answer this call better than anything else. Lilium regale and L martagon seem to cope pretty well.</p> <p>Most annuals do not want to grow in wet sites and many thrive in what amounts to drought - as long as the soil is in good heart. But there are some that make the best of the damp. Annuals for wet soil really need growing indoors or in a seed bed, because the chances are that you won't be able to get a decent tilth to sow the seeds in. It might mean more work, but it is far more economical on seed and gives you more flexibility. Exceptions are poached-egg plants, Limnanthes douglasii, which will grow anywhere, wet or dry, and red orache, Atriplex hortensis, which is an invaluable burgundy foil in the borders. Once established, it will self-seed everywhere and needs brutal thinning. Mimulus grows best in wet and pot marigolds like moist soil. Sweet peas are a must for really rich, damp soil and sunflowers do surprisingly well in the wet. Do remember to stake them more securely than you possibly imagine being necessary, otherwise come September they blow all over the place. </p> <p>Evening primrose is not conventionally a moisture lover, but it grows freely in the wettest parts of our garden. It is not very fashionable to like the evening primrose, but I am very fond of it and love the way it seeds itself everywhere. Finally, another biennial that seeds itself all over our garden, making the most of the endemic wetness, is the teasel (Dipsacus sativus). Like the evening primrose, it is a sort of weed really, but welcome all the same - and hardly ever weeded. </p> <p><strong>My roots: A week in Monty's garden </strong></p> <p>I spent a good hour yesterday playing in the compost heap. This kind of therapy depends on all ingredients being to hand. To wit: milky January sunshine, all the frosted vegetation cleared away after the mini-ice age between Christmas and New Year, a dustbin full of kitchen waste, a bale of straw that got left out in the rain, three barrowloads of mushroom compost to counteract the acidity of all the Christmas tangerine peel, a pile of gritty sand, cardboard from Christmas, a bucket of lime plaster and the contents of the chicken house. I just mix it all with a layering action, keeping the heap as box-like as possible. It works every time. Not only do I immediately feel fully alive, but compost gets made, chickens cleaned out and the dustbin that has only stopped overflowing because I have stamped on it a few times gets emptied at last. </p> <p>A note about the chickens: thanks to an email correspondent I only know as Fiona for the tip about putting wood ash on the henhouse floor. She tells me: 'Poo and potash combine to make an immediately useful fertiliser, and it's much easier to clean out, too.' I put straw down first because the boards in the henhouse have such big gaps between them that the ash would otherwise fall through. </p> <p>I spent about half an hour in the incredibly bright moonlight the other night working out how much to extend a pair of long borders. There are fewer visual distractions at night and the arc of a torch or the selectiveness of moonlight simplifies things. I finally came to the conclusion that just 1ft added to the width of the pair of borders would make a huge difference, both practically and aesthetically.</p> <p> I had kept the path 6ft wide in a slightly fantastical belief that it would be necessary to provide access for tractors. Fat chance. We were loaned a lovely mini-tractor for the duration of filming of Fork to Fork , but that went home and now it is wheelbarrows or nothing.</p> <p> The tulips, alliums and hyacinths are all pushing through in the borders, which is almost entirely heartening. I say almost, because there are a couple of beds in the herb gardens that are filled with lovely 'Queen of the Night' tulips, some lusty lovage plants and rampant wild strawberries. I have been meaning to clear them out and replant all winter and, well, just haven't done it. Now I shall have to wait until June, when the tulips have died back and can be lifted and stored.</p>",

In what was last night being called a 'passports-for-favours' scandal, The Observer can reveal that Mandelson approached the Home Office to find out whether an application from Srichand Hinduja, who had already been turned down for a British passport, would be welcomed. Hinduja duly applied in March 1999 and received his passport six months later - a third of the time a typical decision takes. Calling for an urgent investigation, Liberal Democrat MP Norman Baker said last night: 'We have a rich businessman in the middle of a corruption scandal who gets a British passport in record time after donating \u00a31m to the Dome. It now appears the Minister responsible for the Dome helped to get him a passport. We need a clear statement on who lobbied the Home Office on the Hindujas' behalf and when.'

The two have networked their way to the heart of the British Establishment, inviting Tony and Cherie Blair as guests of honour to a lavish party celebrating Diwali. Four days after Srichand got his passport, they hosted a reception at their London offices in honour of the British legal system to which Mandelson was invited. Mandelson was also a frequent visitor to their central London offices when he was a Minister without Portfolio and Trade Secretary, and one source recalls a dinner Blair and Mandelson had at the Hindujas' central London home before the election.

His account also clashes with that of Home Office officials who said Mandelson made representations in 'mid-1997', when negotiations over the Dome were likely to have been taking place.",

All these problems could have been written off as short-term factors were it not for its immediate plans. </p> <p>The end of the tycoon's brief flirtation with the internet goes to the heart of how News Corp hopes to regain the initiative over the next six months after sitting out the two biggest mergers of all time.

It will be a battle for the type of little black box that channels content into the home. </p> <p>But adverse financial conditions may scupper funding for the huge investments that will turn around the likes of Star TV, which, in dollar terms, cost a billion and has since lost a billion. </p> <p>Over the past few years, Murdoch's empire has been outflanked in the global media game by the likes of Time Warner, Vivendi and young upstart AOL.

Heather Goodchild, the analyst at Standard and Poor's credit rating agency that recently threatened to downgrade News Corp to junk bond status, sees it surviving the downturn relatively unscathed . 'They are in a better position than others because the advertising growth outlook is stronger outside the US, and it is far better spread globally,' she said. </p> <p>Yet News Corp is entering a critical phase, with short-term doubts over its most important revenue stream.

No change for the Mirror there, then. It was Suzy, remember, who broke the story of Piers' share-dealing that landed him in hot water last year and got the woeful Slickers the sack. But in a masterstroke, our hero simply poached Suzy to write the page instead. But Piers is nothing if not sympathetic. 'Yes, I realise you're crap!

There are lots of very strong companies out there.\"</p> <p>Nevertheless, most financial advisers tell clients to diversify and consider alternatives. \"You should diversify in all investments - even when planning for retirement,\" says Garry Spencer of Wilbury Financial Management in Worthing, West Sussex. </p> <p>You should consider Individual Savings Accounts and possibly even property as well as AVC schemes to top up your pension. And for employees earning less than \u00a330,000 a year, there is also the option of investing in the new \"stakeholder pension\" from April.</p> <p>Advisers are less keen on the \"free-standing AVC\". \"FSAVCs have become a bit of a dead duck,' says Bradshaw. While AVCs are set up by your employer to run in parallel to your occupational pension, you choose your own FSAVC from an insurance company. While most employers keep AVC charges on members down to below 1 per cent a year, FSAVC charges can be up to 3 per cent a year. </p> <p>Charges on stakeholder plans, by comparison have by law to be 1 per cent a year or less. Payments are made net of basic-rate tax - so if you decide to go for the maximum amount of \u00a33,600 in a year, you would only pay in \u00a32,808 and the Government would top up the remaining 22 per cent of tax relief. Unlike AVCs, you can also take 25 per cent of the investment fund as a tax-free lump sum.</p> <p>There is another disadvantage with AVCs. 'The problem is that annuity rates have halved in the last 15 years,' says Garry Spencer. Under current rules, you have to buy an annuity from your AVC, FSAVC or other 'money purchase' pension fund by age 75. If AVC rates are low, you still have to buy one - and the rate is fixed for the rest of your life. See Databank, page 18, for current annuity rates.</p> <p>There is another flaw to annuities, as Ian Johnson of accountant Grant Thornton explains: 'Once you buy an annuity, you lose your capital.' So if you buy an annuity for \u00a3100,000 and die the next day, the insurance company pockets the cash. If you had built up \u00a3100,000 of Isas instead, your heirs would inherit the cash.</p> <p>Although these drawbacks may be removed by the Government over the next few years, they are such big disadvantages advisers encourage clients to look at the alternatives. 'Isas in conjunction with pensions are a good idea,' says Johnson. Although you do not get tax relief on the payments into Isas, the income and capital growth are tax-free. You can put up to \u00a37,000 a year into an Isa. Calculations by Grant Thornton, however, suggest that the same sums of money put into Isas and AVCs would, if charges were equal but the investment yields were the same, produce better returns in AVCs.</p> <p>Spencer also warns that Isas are 'too accessible - property fits better into the idea of long-term investment.'</p> <p>There may be other ways to top up your pension. While most people only have the option of 'money purchase' AVCs (such as those run by Equitable Life, where you build up your own investment fund), in some final salary schemes you can buy 'added years' AVCs, which entitle you to a bigger pension.</p> <p>Another possibility is to invest in the government's national savings certificates - but this route is not recommended by most advisers because the rates are not attractive.</p> <p>One message for employees wanting to top up pensions is to investigate the terms they get in their company's AVC scheme. While many employers soak up the charges themselves or negotiate with the AVC provider to keep charges low, this is not always the case.</p>",

You can put up to \u00a37,000 a year into an Isa. Calculations by Grant Thornton, however, suggest that the same sums of money put into Isas and AVCs would, if charges were equal but the investment yields were the same, produce better returns in AVCs. Spencer also warns that Isas are 'too accessible - property fits better into the idea of long-term investment.' There may be other ways to top up your pension. While most people only have the option of 'money purchase' AVCs (such as those run by Equitable Life, where you build up your own investment fund), in some final salary schemes you can buy 'added years' AVCs, which entitle you to a bigger pension. Another possibility is to invest in the government's national savings certificates - but this route is not recommended by most advisers because the rates are not attractive. One message for employees wanting to top up pensions is to investigate the terms they get in their company's AVC scheme. While many employers soak up the charges themselves or negotiate with the AVC provider to keep charges low, this is not always the case.",

      "body": "<p>If you want to know the Government's plans for joining the single currency, it may be an idea to get a job in the boardroom of a major manufacturer that has decisions to make about investment and employment in the UK. </p> <p>In MPs' minds, talking about joining the euro is high risk. But for industrialists such as John Cushnaghan of Nissan UK, waiting for a decision from Japan on whether it will build the next model of Micra city car in his Sunderland plant, or Sir Brian Moffat of Corus, the Anglo-Dutch steelmaker, who is pondering the closure of UK works, it is a matter of life or death - or, at least, growth or cuts. </p> <p>In their meetings with Ministers and officials to discuss their plans, these bosses have a singular private opportunity to sound out Government thinking. </p> <p>But even advanced knowledge of Government plans, which is vital to manufacturers who export to Europe and who find that the high value of sterling makes them uncompetitive, is insufficient help if the plans themselves are unfavourable. </p> <p>One senior executive at one major motor manufacturer said: 'The Government should say that we are going into the euro and that this is what we are going to do to make the Chancellor's five economic tests for joining converge, rather than saying that if they are met, we will go in. If they used the first way, the markets would have adjusted and the rate would have eased.' </p> <p>Industrialists do not suggest that the Government is cold on the issue. Our motor executive says: 'My impression from talking to them is that they want a referendum a year after an election.' </p> <p>Indeed a recent Treasury report - released without fanfare - indicates that on crucial measures such as long- and short-term interest rates and Government debt, the UK is converging with Euroland. </p> <p>But for the time being the man calling the shots is the author of the five tests, and he has said hold your fire. </p> <p>While a ceasefire may make political sense, it comes at a crucial time economically. The outlook is uncertain, with the US facing a downturn in the first half of this year. The euro has recently edged around 10 cents higher against the dollar, to $0.94, and sterling has jittered slightly, partly because of concerns about knock-on effects for Britain of what is happening in the US. But a sharp American slowdown could dampen world demand for manufactured goods. </p> <p>For the past decade, the exchange rate has arguably been the most important economic factor for UK manufacturers, and their experience of it may help signal what happens in future. </p> <p>Douglas McWilliams of the Centre for Economic and Business Research (CEBR) says: 'The exchange rate has been a huge influence. In the period coming out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism after 1992, the pound fell until 1995 [to DM 2.16] and then rose dramatically [to DM 3.40] and has remained strong ever since. This has a major impact on manufacturers.' </p> <p>Nick Cunningham, engineering analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, has examined the currency effect on engineering companies. Shortly after the 1992 devaluation, engineering shares rose in value on the stock market, outperforming the market as a whole by about a third until spring 1994. When sterling climbed between October 1996 and mid 1997, [from around DM2.30 to over DM3] the sector fell back by 20 per cent. </p> <p>Cunningham also notes that while share prices react quickly, profits lag behind as companies take hedging positions. So engineering earnings took until 1995 to rise in response to the 1992 devaluation, and another two years to fall after 1997. But, though delayed, the impact is marked. </p> <p>It works something like this. If 100 per cent of a company's costs are in the UK, 100 per cent of its revenues are in Europe and the company's margin is 10 per cent, then 90 per cent of its revenues are UK-based costs. If sterling devalues by 20 per cent, costs remain the same, but revenues rise from 100 to 120. Margins therefore shoot up from 10 to 25 per cent. The reverse is true of revaluation. </p> <p>CEBR research in 1998 - when sterling headed over DM3.00 - into the steel and metal forging industries indicates how hard they were hit by the revaluation effect. </p> <p>The CEBR found that the difference in the exchange rate in March 1998, compared with 1992-7, raised steel production costs (expressed in dollars) in the UK by nearly 4 per cent, while costs in France, Germany and Japan fell by between 9 and 13 per cent, making the UK 11.7 per cent less cost-competitive. </p> <p>Research into the metal forging sector, a key supplier and cost to the motor industry, indicated a similar pattern: the sector would have had to cut profits by 13.6 per cent to remain competitive. </p> <p>Ian Rogers of the UK Steel Association says: 'The problem has been the speed of the rise. We could live with DM 2.70 - probably even 2.90 now - but we are still 40 per cent above 1996 levels.' </p> <p>Looking back to the early Nineties Cunningham notes: 'There are two impacts of devaluation. One is that businesses are more competitive so they can win volume. The other is margin, and people increase prices initially to get margins up.' </p> <p>It is the balance between margin and market share that worries analysts and economists. Jonathan Loynes of Capital Economics says: 'The important thing about 1992 was that manufacturers played a short-term game. The depreciation gave a dramatic boost to UK goods in world markets. Either they kept sterling prices where they were and used the devaluation to gain a stronger foothold in world markets, or they played short-term and whacked up sterling prices to enjoy wider profit margins. They went for the short term.' </p> <p>Economists agree that the results of this process - pursuit of margin over market share - have been partially masked so far by strong world demand, which has kept exportsin some sectors buoyant - although ot hers, including steel, have faced problems. In addition, some manufacturers have taken action themselves, often by cutting workforces. Corus, for example, last year axed 4,500 jobs in the UK. Neil Marshall, director general of the Confederation of British Metalforming, says: 'Before Christmas, many of my members were planning redundancy programmes.' </p> <p>Manufacturers, particularly textiles makers, have also looked to shift cost bases to Europe and beyond. If Corus shuts a UK plant, it will effectively be shifting production to its Dutch operations, inside Euroland. </p> <p>But headline export growth cannot disguise the vital importance of the currency situation. A Euro Strategies/CEBR survey of 121 manufacturers last September is gloomy: UK exports were 11 per cent lower than they would have been if the currency had remained unchanged, with \u00a331 billion thus lost in export earnings. </p> <p>The outlook is unclear. Share prices - for example, Corus's - have responded to the softening in exchange rates, but earnings, market share and competitiveness are likely to lag. And in any case a beneficial exchange rate effect could be offset by weaker world demand. </p> <p>McWilliams says: 'Corus, for example, is one of the most efficient steel companies. But it has two problems - the exchange rate and world overcapacity in steel - ominous in the context of world demand. With a fair exchange rate, you could expect it to compete well. Without one, it is going to be very tough.' </p> <p>Sterling may not come down quickly. Loynes estimates that it will fall to a DM 2.80 equivalent by mid-2002. That, of course, looks like a good rate for euro entry, but next year may be too late for many companies and their workers. </p> <p>Perhaps the only way to speed convergence of the British and Euroland economies would be a political declaration in favour of early entry. </p> <p>Robert Peston, editorial director of CSQuest.com, the online financial service for fund managers, says: 'The timing of the referendum is always going to be political.' But he believes global changes could shape the debate and break the present stalemate. </p> <p>'The outlook for the US is looking less exciting,' Peston says. 'If you add to that a US President who is less sympathique and a Europe that is looking more interesting, the whole euro issue looks a bit more enticing for a Labour government.' </p> <p>We shall have to wait and see. The question remains, as ever, for how long? And who will suffer in the meantime?</p>",

      "body": "<p>The euro's popularity remains low in the UK, and on the Continent it appears to be losing support. In the euro area countries this may be influenced by the weakness of the euro relative to the US dollar - something that could change if the euro continues its recent recovery. </p> <p>Attitudes in the UK are probably coloured by a view that our economy is more successful than those of our neighbours. But if you look at the evidence on productivity and living standards in countries such as Germany, this view cannot be supported. </p> <p>The economic debate in the UK focuses on whether it makes economic sense to join and, in particular, on the third and fourth of the Chancellor's tests: 'Are business cycles and economic structures compatible so that we and others in Europe could live comfortably with euro interest rates on a long-term basis?' and 'If problems do emerge, is there sufficient flexibility to deal with them?' </p> <p>In reality, however, the cyclical position of the United Kingdom is currently not very different from that of the euro area economies. Both have strong growth and low inflation, and unemployment is relatively low. </p> <p>The OECD estimates that in 2000, output in the UK was less than 1 percentage point above its long-run sustainable level. But, since there are no current signs of inflationary pressure, this is questionable. The OECD estimates that on average the euro area economies are operating at around capacity, and we would judge this to be the case. There are of course differences within the area, but the economies are generally converging. France's output is estimated to be 0.3 percentage points above, and Germany's 0.7 per cent below long-run levels, and this may explain why French inflation is expected to be above that in Germany at present.

      "bodyText": "The euro's popularity remains low in the UK, and on the Continent it appears to be losing support. In the euro area countries this may be influenced by the weakness of the euro relative to the US dollar - something that could change if the euro continues its recent recovery. Attitudes in the UK are probably coloured by a view that our economy is more successful than those of our neighbours. But if you look at the evidence on productivity and living standards in countries such as Germany, this view cannot be supported. The economic debate in the UK focuses on whether it makes economic sense to join and, in particular, on the third and fourth of the Chancellor's tests: 'Are business cycles and economic structures compatible so that we and others in Europe could live comfortably with euro interest rates on a long-term basis?' and 'If problems do emerge, is there sufficient flexibility to deal with them?' In reality, however, the cyclical position of the United Kingdom is currently not very different from that of the euro area economies. Both have strong growth and low inflation, and unemployment is relatively low. The OECD estimates that in 2000, output in the UK was less than 1 percentage point above its long-run sustainable level. But, since there are no current signs of inflationary pressure, this is questionable. The OECD estimates that on average the euro area economies are operating at around capacity, and we would judge this to be the case. There are of course differences within the area, but the economies are generally converging. France's output is estimated to be 0.3 percentage points above, and Germany's 0.7 per cent below long-run levels, and this may explain why French inflation is expected to be above that in Germany at present. The overall economic situation in the euro area looks very similar to the UK's. The Chancellor's worries about diverging cycles reflect problems we have seen in the past, rather than the situation today, where cyclical fluctuations appear only moderate. Current circumstances should be contrasted with the last major economic cycle, a decade ago: in 1989 UK output is estimated to have been 4.7 per cent above the long-run sustainable level, while in 1992 it was 4 per cent below.

They were not innocent: almost all were confessed Democrats, and half of them were African-Americans. They lost their right to vote, costing Gore the White House. The list of faux felons was provided by the firm contracted by the state to search records is ChoicePoint DBT. This company's board is stuffed with Republican bigwigs, though ChoicePoint denies it favours any party. Our report caused some discomfort in the States. Of a thousand letters I received, one stood out: 'You pansey [sic] Brits think that the average American is under-educated and stupid. Yor [sic] story is full of outright lies.' But rather than seeking a correction, the writer made some uncomfortable suggestions for the improper use of the Prince of Wales. Now, a coalition of America's leading civil rights lawyers, acting for the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People, has filed a class action suit against the Florida Secretary of State, Katherine Harris and ChoicePoint for 'wrongfully purging black voters', which, it turns out, is a violation of the US Constitution. ChoicePoint says the claims are baseless. The NAACP's lawyers thanked The Observer for uncovering the facts. Unfortunately, unlike our letter writer, they had no suggestions as to what we should do with the Prince.",

      "bodyText": "Undercover Israeli soldiers posing as Arabs last night captured a young Palestinian woman suspected of luring an Israeli youth to his death via the internet. The woman, a 25-year-old freelance journalist with an Israeli identity card, was arrested in the village of Bir-Nabala near the West Bank town of Ramallah, not far from where the body of the 16 year old was dumped. Mona Najar was seized in a pre-dawn raid on her parents' home by troops from Israel's elite Duvdevan unit. Najar is suspected of being involved in the internet exchange that led to the death of Ophir Rakhum, from the coastal town of Ashkelon. 'The Israeli army arrested the young woman who took part in the murder of this young boy,' a military spokeswoman said. 'She was arrested on Friday.' A senior Palestinian security official said the woman had surfed the web from an internet cafe, but anyone could have used her computer terminal. The murder of Rakhum shocked even those Israelis who thought they had become inured to the violence of the last few months of the intifada . Despite the recent executions and arrests of alleged Palestinian collaborators with Israel, the woman's capture again demonstrated how thoroughly the Israeli security services have penetrated the West Bank and Gaza. Friends of the murdered Israeli youth say the person who lured him to his death had told Rakhum in emails that she was an American tourist living in Jerusalem. The two met in the city once, and Rakhum left his home again last week to meet her. He told friends that if he did not return the same evening he would be back in the morning 'and would tell them all the details'. He was somehow lured to Ramallah, where the woman's accomplices shot him dead last Wednesday. Security sources had speculated that the youth was deliberately enticed there to be killed. Palestinian sources claim he was killed in an ambush by locals on his girlfriend's car. They say he was seized on a side road by Palestinians who then shot and killed him. The youth was reportedly to have taken a large sum of money with him to the meeting. When the body was first found, both the Israeli Defence Force and the Palestinian Authority believed it was of a Palestinian killed for collaborating with Israel. Following police reports of a missing youth, the head of the District Co-ordination Office in Ramallah, Lieutenant-Colonel Amir Sfadi, asked Palestinian security officials to investigate. After failing to get clear answers, Sfadi turned to high-ranking PA officials, including the commander of the Palestinian security forces in the West Bank, Haj Ismail. The body was then identified as that of an Israeli youth who had been reported missing and handed over to the Israeli authorities. The killing shook Israel because of its cruelty, and prompted Prime Minister Ehud Barak to briefly postpone consideration of a Palestinian offer of peace talks, which he eventually accepted yesterday.. Most Israelis believe Rakhum's killing to be a political murder, though it could be criminal, because of the money he was said to be carrying. Israeli television said the Shin Bet security service was instrumental in locating the suspect using information they found stored in Rakhum's computer. The arrest came as Israel's 'peace cabinet' decided to enter the peace talks in Egypt with the Palestinians. These could give a new push to peacemaking early in George W. Bush's presidency. Israeli and Palestinian officials said the ministerial-level negotiations would begin late today in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Taba, venue for talks on interim peace arrangements in 1995.",

      "byline": "Gaby Wood",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Charlotte Rampling hasn't changed. 'Yes, it's quite strange,' she says when I tell her this. 'I think I'm going to be like my father, who never really changed. I mean, he got older, but he's remained the same. Some people do that.' She still has that mysterious, feline grace with which she made her name, still has what her sometime co-star Dirk Bogarde described as 'the Look', an epithet not for her Sixties style, but for a certain action in her eyes which could, he said, express horror with extreme power. Visconti showed his cameraman how to frame her face, close up, like a visor, with chin and forehead lopped off. </p> <p>Today, those eyes seem a screen of smoke or steel; she has a faraway gaze even when she is looking straight at you. There is an almost ethereal otherworldliness about her, and a contrastingly gritty sexuality. She has been living in France for more than a quarter of a century and says she prefers to be a foreigner, 'not to be completely connected anywhere'. The sultry, honeyed voice, the casually held cigarillo, the vague and thoughtful manner of her speech - these are the emblems of Rampling's persona. </p> <p>She speaks in abstractions, and everything is either thrown into doubt or made so universal it becomes ordinary: 'It's like life,' she says broadly. 'How much actually do you know about much, really? Not very much'; or 'I'm not uncertain about things... I'm uncertain about everything, so I'm not really uncertain about anything.' It's hard to know whether to take these musings as barriers or communications, and difficult to see if they are the open-ended constructs of a philosophical mind or the flaky waftings of a Norma Desmond. </p> <p>I try to navigate through them, interpreting her words according to what I think I know about her life. Pinning them down feels like a job of unusual indiscretion: initially, when speaking about her sister's early death, Rampling comments with a generalising flourish that 'everybody' is in mourning 'at some point'. Her break-up five years ago from her husband, the composer Jean-Michel Jarre, was 'difficult, like everybody's separation is difficult, but it's absolutely fine'. Her depression was just 'confusion... nothing special'. </p> <p>Rampling's latest role, in Fran\u00e7ois Ozon's Under the Sand, is that of a woman in denial. It is a wonderful film and, for Rampling, a remarkable return to form. Rampling's character - Marie, a sensual, apparently self-assured woman in her fifties - and her husband set off for their usual summer holiday by the shore, but on the first day, as she is sunbathing, her husband goes for a swim and disappears. Has he left her? Has he drowned? Was it an accident or suicide? Ozon, a young hotshot who directed Sitcom and Water Drops on Burning Rocks, filmed this first section without knowing what would come next. </p> <p>Six months later, Rampling returned to shoot the rest of the movie, in which she denies her husband's death. What appears at first to be a mystery turns out to be a psychological portrait and, although it's not certain quite to what extent, the denial portion of the film was written in response to Rampling's performance in the earlier sequence. </p> <p>Unlike most actors, who like to keep their identities separate from the parts they play, Rampling elides the distinction between herself and her roles. You can only play a character if you can find that person somewhere in you, she says, or if you feel ready to expose that part of yourself. Of the Ozon role, she comments: 'She could be me. I'm not acting Marie, I'm just being her.' Perhaps, then, Rampling has already said it all, since through her films it's possible not only to trace her life, but her moods as well, the many facets of her changing self. </p> <p>Rampling made her screen debut in Richard Lester's 1965 sex comedy, The Knack, And How To Get It. She was 19. She had wanted to be a singer and, as teenagers, she and her sister had an act in which they sang French songs (their father worked in the army, so both had been to French schools on their travels). But when they were hired by a nightclub, their father put a stop to it and sent Charlotte to secretarial school. She was spotted in a typing pool and cast in an ad for Cadbury's chocolate; the movies came soon after. Her first main part was in a Boulting brothers comedy, Rotten to the Core, but she really shot to fame a year later, in 1966, when she played Lynn Redgrave's catty friend in Georgy Girl. She felt, she now says, 'very much of my time', and she had a look to go with it: sexy, coltish, skinny, free. She was a mini-skirted, Mini Coopered Chelsea girl, and she thought being famous was 'great fun'. </p> <p>But the Sixties turned into the Seventies very dramatically. When Rampling was 21, her sister, who was only two years older, died of a brain haemorrhage and, as she puts it, 'my mother almost died out of grief'. 'So,' she comments with a bitter laugh, 'things suddenly weren't swinging any more, quite like they were. I think that's when I tried to understand what the hell was going on, and took parts like Night Porter, and other parts that sort of delved into the human psyche - they weren't just entertainment films. I didn't want to entertain any more. I became very aware of the other side of life, not just having fun.' </p> <p>Luchino Visconti cast her in The Damned as a young wife who is sent to a concentration camp. A few years later, she survived the camp in Night Porter, still perhaps her most famous role. She played the wife of a successful orchestra conductor who recognises Dirk Bogarde, the night porter of their Viennese hotel, as the Nazi who had been her lover and oppressor during the war. The gruelling flashbacks end up matching the forward progress of the film, as the twisted lovers return irretrievably to their former selves. </p> <p>She became a Bacall for the Seventies when she starred opposite Robert Mitchum in a remake of Raymond Chandler's Farewell, My Lovely, and she kicked off the Eighties as an entrancing depressive in Woody Allen's Stardust Memories ('I think they've been putting something wonderful in your lithium,' Allen whispers in her ear). This, perhaps perversely, is my favourite character of hers. In the film, it is said of her that 'two days a month she was the most fabulous woman in the world. The rest of the time she was a basket case'. </p> <p>'Yeah,' Rampling says when I quote the phrase to her, 'those are Woody Allen's lines. But that's sort of me anyway. It was very much me, that part.' In her review of the film, Pauline Kael wrote that Rampling 'suggests a decaying goddess', and Woody Allen, who once said his ideal dinner party would include Rampling and Kafka, cast her because, as he put it, 'she reeks from neurosis'. Towards the end of the film, there is an extraordinary sequence of jump-cuts, a Bergmanesque series of close-ups of her face as she rambles and weeps, her moods shifting, her mind shutting down. 'It took a long time to get that,' Rampling now explains. 'It took a long time to work out how you show somebody breaking down.' </p> <p>When I ask her about her own depression, however, she says: 'I didn't think I was depressive at all. I thought I was very confused, but I thought that was what life was about.' Rampling had a nervous breakdown in 1991. She says now that pure psychoanalysis doesn't suit her, that there are 'other ways you can jump-cut a bit, rather like the scene in the Woody Allen movie, and project people into their own reality quicker', though she is known to have spent some time in a psychiatric clinic in London. </p> <p>'I thought life was not comfortable,' she goes on, 'and you were always on edge and you were always having difficulties with most things. There really weren't many times when you felt that you were confident about anything. But I thought that was what most people felt. It was nothing special.' </p> <p>I suggest that she must have managed to avoid the loneliness of it, if she thought everyone felt like that. 'Well,' she replies, switching into the second person, 'no, you do. Yeah, you feel alone... also, at that time, there was very little help of the kind there is now, in terms of recognising symptoms in people and being able to talk about them. And so you think, well, it's either just me, or life will come along and help me out, things will happen that will make it different - and quite often they do.' </p> <p>Rampling first married in 1972, to Brian Southcombe, her manager. They had a son, but by 1977 she had left him for Jean-Michel Jarre and had a child with Jarre. Along with his baby daughter by his previous wife, the new Jarre family set up home in a grand mansion in Versailles. They were the perfect couple of the moment - glamorous, jet-set, successful, in love, and they welcomed people into their house which, with its lawns that swept down to the Seine and its chic art deco furniture, was much remarked upon. Their separation 'evolved', Rampling says, 'over the last five or six years'. Jarre stayed in Versailles and she moved to Paris. Both are now in new relationships. </p> <p>I ask her if the process has made her feel disappointed in marriage. 'No, not at all,' she says. 'We have a fantastic marriage - I don't see why I should divorce - I mean eventually, if I want to live with another man, but if not it doesn't really make much sense - if he doesn't want to, if I don't want to... </p> <p>'Nothing stays the same,' she explains, 'but it doesn't mean to say it's been a mistake or that you even have to question it.' </p> <p> Whether or not you take this demeanour at face value, Rampling certainly seems to have arrived at a fortress-like strength. If, as she does, you conjoin her parts and her personality, this is a character unrecognisable to those acquainted with her former neurotic incarnation. I tell her she seems impressively unworried about things. </p> <p>'I'm not worried,' she replies, 'it's true. I was, highly, but now I'm not. It changes as you go along. And the main reason it changes is you decide not to be affected by it. Because you're the only person who has to hang in there with it: if you hate your husband, you have to live with that hate - he's not living with it, he's gone, and you have to live with the hate and the revenge. Unless you go and kill him, and then you're going to be in prison, so what are you actually going to do about it? If you see me calm now it's because you have to turn it right round. Because nobody gives a stuff what you're feeling like, really - nobody, probably in the whole world. That's what I've thought when I've felt really upset about things that have happened to me. It just eats away at you. Suffering is only subjective.' </p> <p>She thinks for a moment, the bitter toughness melting into something else. 'You see, if you say, \"Right, so your husband leaves\" - he didn't leave me, it was a natural thing. And actually, what he did for me and how much he helped me no one will ever, ever know. And he needed a break. He didn't leave me, he just needed a break. It so happened that on that break things happened. He might have fallen in love with another woman, but I mean he might then fall out of love with another woman... it doesn't break what we have - that's eternal as far as I'm concerned.' </p> <p>Rampling has taken a long break from filming. 'I didn't want to expose myself, that was all,' she says, 'and my business is total exposure.' She worked in television, things for which she wouldn't have to do publicity, keeping 'very much in the shadows' because she 'didn't want anyone to take any notice of me'. </p> <p>The recent small parts she has played, such as Miss Havisham in the BBC adaptation of Great Expectations and Helena Bonham Carter's Aunt Maud in Wings of the Dove, have been older, ungenerous women. She was, until now, invisible as herself. </p> <p>But she has hit a new streak. Earlier this month she was awarded an OBE, 'for services to acting and UK-French cultural relations'. Her character in Under the Sand is, as she puts it, 'much more open and gentle, and shows her fragilities more than other characters I've played'. Rampling says she is 'more willing now to show a lot of stuff that I wouldn't have shown before - it was not for the cinema'. </p> <p>She is moving on - perhaps (or perhaps not) protecting herself from the past as she goes. She does not, for example, watch her old films ('One day I suppose I will - you need that emotional distance from it'), and when I ask her what she likes to read, she reflects that: 'I don't read biographies very much, perhaps I should. I don't like biographies. It's really rather funny, that, isn't it? Why don't I like to know about people's lives?' </p> <p>It's loaded rhetoric, and though it is offered up with a casual laugh, her smouldering eyes can still only be seen through a haze of smoke, as Rampling takes comfort in being a stranger. </p> <p>Under the Sand opens in France next month and here in April. Charlotte Rampling will be interviewed at the NFT in March</p>",

      "bodyText": "Charlotte Rampling hasn't changed. 'Yes, it's quite strange,' she says when I tell her this. 'I think I'm going to be like my father, who never really changed. I mean, he got older, but he's remained the same. Some people do that.' She still has that mysterious, feline grace with which she made her name, still has what her sometime co-star Dirk Bogarde described as 'the Look', an epithet not for her Sixties style, but for a certain action in her eyes which could, he said, express horror with extreme power. Visconti showed his cameraman how to frame her face, close up, like a visor, with chin and forehead lopped off. Today, those eyes seem a screen of smoke or steel; she has a faraway gaze even when she is looking straight at you. There is an almost ethereal otherworldliness about her, and a contrastingly gritty sexuality. She has been living in France for more than a quarter of a century and says she prefers to be a foreigner, 'not to be completely connected anywhere'. The sultry, honeyed voice, the casually held cigarillo, the vague and thoughtful manner of her speech - these are the emblems of Rampling's persona. She speaks in abstractions, and everything is either thrown into doubt or made so universal it becomes ordinary: 'It's like life,' she says broadly. 'How much actually do you know about much, really? Not very much'; or 'I'm not uncertain about things... I'm uncertain about everything, so I'm not really uncertain about anything.' It's hard to know whether to take these musings as barriers or communications, and difficult to see if they are the open-ended constructs of a philosophical mind or the flaky waftings of a Norma Desmond. I try to navigate through them, interpreting her words according to what I think I know about her life. Pinning them down feels like a job of unusual indiscretion: initially, when speaking about her sister's early death, Rampling comments with a generalising flourish that 'everybody' is in mourning 'at some point'. Her break-up five years ago from her husband, the composer Jean-Michel Jarre, was 'difficult, like everybody's separation is difficult, but it's absolutely fine'. Her depression was just 'confusion... nothing special'. Rampling's latest role, in Fran\u00e7ois Ozon's Under the Sand, is that of a woman in denial. It is a wonderful film and, for Rampling, a remarkable return to form. Rampling's character - Marie, a sensual, apparently self-assured woman in her fifties - and her husband set off for their usual summer holiday by the shore, but on the first day, as she is sunbathing, her husband goes for a swim and disappears. Has he left her? Has he drowned? Was it an accident or suicide? Ozon, a young hotshot who directed Sitcom and Water Drops on Burning Rocks, filmed this first section without knowing what would come next. Six months later, Rampling returned to shoot the rest of the movie, in which she denies her husband's death. What appears at first to be a mystery turns out to be a psychological portrait and, although it's not certain quite to what extent, the denial portion of the film was written in response to Rampling's performance in the earlier sequence. Unlike most actors, who like to keep their identities separate from the parts they play, Rampling elides the distinction between herself and her roles. You can only play a character if you can find that person somewhere in you, she says, or if you feel ready to expose that part of yourself. Of the Ozon role, she comments: 'She could be me. I'm not acting Marie, I'm just being her.' Perhaps, then, Rampling has already said it all, since through her films it's possible not only to trace her life, but her moods as well, the many facets of her changing self. Rampling made her screen debut in Richard Lester's 1965 sex comedy, The Knack, And How To Get It. She was 19. She had wanted to be a singer and, as teenagers, she and her sister had an act in which they sang French songs (their father worked in the army, so both had been to French schools on their travels). But when they were hired by a nightclub, their father put a stop to it and sent Charlotte to secretarial school. She was spotted in a typing pool and cast in an ad for Cadbury's chocolate; the movies came soon after. Her first main part was in a Boulting brothers comedy, Rotten to the Core, but she really shot to fame a year later, in 1966, when she played Lynn Redgrave's catty friend in Georgy Girl. She felt, she now says, 'very much of my time', and she had a look to go with it: sexy, coltish, skinny, free. She was a mini-skirted, Mini Coopered Chelsea girl, and she thought being famous was 'great fun'. But the Sixties turned into the Seventies very dramatically. When Rampling was 21, her sister, who was only two years older, died of a brain haemorrhage and, as she puts it, 'my mother almost died out of grief'. 'So,' she comments with a bitter laugh, 'things suddenly weren't swinging any more, quite like they were. I think that's when I tried to understand what the hell was going on, and took parts like Night Porter, and other parts that sort of delved into the human psyche - they weren't just entertainment films. I didn't want to entertain any more. I became very aware of the other side of life, not just having fun.' Luchino Visconti cast her in The Damned as a young wife who is sent to a concentration camp. A few years later, she survived the camp in Night Porter, still perhaps her most famous role. She played the wife of a successful orchestra conductor who recognises Dirk Bogarde, the night porter of their Viennese hotel, as the Nazi who had been her lover and oppressor during the war. The gruelling flashbacks end up matching the forward progress of the film, as the twisted lovers return irretrievably to their former selves. She became a Bacall for the Seventies when she starred opposite Robert Mitchum in a remake of Raymond Chandler's Farewell, My Lovely, and she kicked off the Eighties as an entrancing depressive in Woody Allen's Stardust Memories ('I think they've been putting something wonderful in your lithium,' Allen whispers in her ear). This, perhaps perversely, is my favourite character of hers. In the film, it is said of her that 'two days a month she was the most fabulous woman in the world. The rest of the time she was a basket case'. 'Yeah,' Rampling says when I quote the phrase to her, 'those are Woody Allen's lines. But that's sort of me anyway. It was very much me, that part.' In her review of the film, Pauline Kael wrote that Rampling 'suggests a decaying goddess', and Woody Allen, who once said his ideal dinner party would include Rampling and Kafka, cast her because, as he put it, 'she reeks from neurosis'. Towards the end of the film, there is an extraordinary sequence of jump-cuts, a Bergmanesque series of close-ups of her face as she rambles and weeps, her moods shifting, her mind shutting down. 'It took a long time to get that,' Rampling now explains. 'It took a long time to work out how you show somebody breaking down.' When I ask her about her own depression, however, she says: 'I didn't think I was depressive at all. I thought I was very confused, but I thought that was what life was about.' Rampling had a nervous breakdown in 1991. She says now that pure psychoanalysis doesn't suit her, that there are 'other ways you can jump-cut a bit, rather like the scene in the Woody Allen movie, and project people into their own reality quicker', though she is known to have spent some time in a psychiatric clinic in London. 'I thought life was not comfortable,' she goes on, 'and you were always on edge and you were always having difficulties with most things. There really weren't many times when you felt that you were confident about anything. But I thought that was what most people felt. It was nothing special.' I suggest that she must have managed to avoid the loneliness of it, if she thought everyone felt like that. 'Well,' she replies, switching into the second person, 'no, you do. Yeah, you feel alone... also, at that time, there was very little help of the kind there is now, in terms of recognising symptoms in people and being able to talk about them. And so you think, well, it's either just me, or life will come along and help me out, things will happen that will make it different - and quite often they do.' Rampling first married in 1972, to Brian Southcombe, her manager. They had a son, but by 1977 she had left him for Jean-Michel Jarre and had a child with Jarre. Along with his baby daughter by his previous wife, the new Jarre family set up home in a grand mansion in Versailles. They were the perfect couple of the moment - glamorous, jet-set, successful, in love, and they welcomed people into their house which, with its lawns that swept down to the Seine and its chic art deco furniture, was much remarked upon. Their separation 'evolved', Rampling says, 'over the last five or six years'. Jarre stayed in Versailles and she moved to Paris. Both are now in new relationships. I ask her if the process has made her feel disappointed in marriage. 'No, not at all,' she says. 'We have a fantastic marriage - I don't see why I should divorce - I mean eventually, if I want to live with another man, but if not it doesn't really make much sense - if he doesn't want to, if I don't want to... 'Nothing stays the same,' she explains, 'but it doesn't mean to say it's been a mistake or that you even have to question it.' Whether or not you take this demeanour at face value, Rampling certainly seems to have arrived at a fortress-like strength. If, as she does, you conjoin her parts and her personality, this is a character unrecognisable to those acquainted with her former neurotic incarnation. I tell her she seems impressively unworried about things. 'I'm not worried,' she replies, 'it's true. I was, highly, but now I'm not. It changes as you go along. And the main reason it changes is you decide not to be affected by it. Because you're the only person who has to hang in there with it: if you hate your husband, you have to live with that hate - he's not living with it, he's gone, and you have to live with the hate and the revenge. Unless you go and kill him, and then you're going to be in prison, so what are you actually going to do about it? If you see me calm now it's because you have to turn it right round. Because nobody gives a stuff what you're feeling like, really - nobody, probably in the whole world. That's what I've thought when I've felt really upset about things that have happened to me. It just eats away at you. Suffering is only subjective.' She thinks for a moment, the bitter toughness melting into something else. 'You see, if you say, \"Right, so your husband leaves\" - he didn't leave me, it was a natural thing. And actually, what he did for me and how much he helped me no one will ever, ever know. And he needed a break. He didn't leave me, he just needed a break. It so happened that on that break things happened. He might have fallen in love with another woman, but I mean he might then fall out of love with another woman... it doesn't break what we have - that's eternal as far as I'm concerned.' Rampling has taken a long break from filming. 'I didn't want to expose myself, that was all,' she says, 'and my business is total exposure.' She worked in television, things for which she wouldn't have to do publicity, keeping 'very much in the shadows' because she 'didn't want anyone to take any notice of me'. The recent small parts she has played, such as Miss Havisham in the BBC adaptation of Great Expectations and Helena Bonham Carter's Aunt Maud in Wings of the Dove, have been older, ungenerous women. She was, until now, invisible as herself. But she has hit a new streak. Earlier this month she was awarded an OBE, 'for services to acting and UK-French cultural relations'. Her character in Under the Sand is, as she puts it, 'much more open and gentle, and shows her fragilities more than other characters I've played'. Rampling says she is 'more willing now to show a lot of stuff that I wouldn't have shown before - it was not for the cinema'. She is moving on - perhaps (or perhaps not) protecting herself from the past as she goes. She does not, for example, watch her old films ('One day I suppose I will - you need that emotional distance from it'), and when I ask her what she likes to read, she reflects that: 'I don't read biographies very much, perhaps I should. I don't like biographies. It's really rather funny, that, isn't it? Why don't I like to know about people's lives?' It's loaded rhetoric, and though it is offered up with a casual laugh, her smouldering eyes can still only be seen through a haze of smoke, as Rampling takes comfort in being a stranger. Under the Sand opens in France next month and here in April. Charlotte Rampling will be interviewed at the NFT in March",

      "body": "<p>It is blue, cold, clean weather in the City of London. The streets gleam and the pale sun shines down between the corridor of tall buildings. People hurry about their daily business: men and women in suits or jeans; people carrying shopping bags, briefcases, newspapers, gloves; heads down against the wind. Cars, double-decker buses, lorries and cabs drive past. A horn sounds. At the traffic light across the road a bunch of pedestrians wait for the signal to cross. A young man in a battered leather jacket, with dark hair and dark eyes, stands in front of them, next to a tall, blonde woman with a sweet and lovely face. Strangers. They glance at each other and their eyes lock. You can almost feel the tremor of shock that passes through them. </p> <p>The lights change, and they step out into the road together. At the other side they separate, but they do not stop looking at each other. They cannot. Is this love, this sudden jolting recognition of the other? Or madness? Can life so turn on a single glance, and everything that went before become muted and dull? </p> <p>Can falling in love take a fraction of a second and yet bring the patient work of years crashing down? </p> <p>At last, the young woman with the entranced face goes into the building where she works; he watches as she walks away from him and disappears from view. </p> <p>I watch this scene - over and over again I watch it - and it feels infinitely strange to me. I know it and I don't know it. It is vivid and yet at the same time it feels far-off, a bit like a shred of a dream, or something lying underwater, shining and mysteriously refracted. It feels like memory. </p> <p>'Cut!' shouts the director, and Joseph Fiennes and Heather Graham turn round, retrace their steps and it all begins again. There are hundreds of extras; a large production crew. The camera rolls along a specially-constructed track beside the two actors. People throw buckets of water over the road to keep it wet (in case it rains later and destroys continuity). Heather Graham snags her tights and has to change them. Someone else fiddles with the collar of Fiennes' jacket, making an invisible difference. </p> <p>Everyone seems to know what they're doing. But I don't quite know what I'm doing. I watch the scene on the director's monitor, and it looks quite different from the scene being acted out a few feet away on the street. The camera changes everything. </p> <p>Two-and-a-quarter years ago, Sean and I were driving to my parents' house in Shropshire. My mother had been very ill, frightening all of us. I had returned from our summer holiday early to be with her, but now she seemed to be slowly recovering (fingers crossed and pray to a God I don't believe in). We were in the middle of writing our third Nicci French (Nicci Gerrard and Sean French) novel together, a psychological thriller. It was going all right, but slowly, without that sense of urgency and fire. And it had been pushed into the background a bit by other events. </p> <p>One of us (who? we can't remember any more) said to the other something about the blurred line between love and madness, passion and danger. Maybe we were discussing a recent case of stalking that had, perhaps, been in the news. Or we were arguing about A Midsummer Night's Dream, where the lovers go into a dark forest and let wild dreams grip them. Or about our own early relationship. Or maybe it's just one of those subjects that two people who talk to each other a lot discuss when on a long car journey towards an uncertain destination. And one of us said to the other: that would make a good basis for a novel. So the discussion became Killing Me Softly (except that wasn't its name, then). </p> <p>We immediately jettisoned the work-in-progress and wrote the novel very quickly. It was the story of an English woman called Alice - who has now become the American Heather Graham, walking across the road - who has everything she thinks she wants (good job, nice and kind and reliable boyfriend, close group of friends) and throws it all up because she meets the gaze of a stranger on a crowded street. We wanted to express, in the novel, the weirdness of falling in love, its disorder and irrationality and danger. </p> <p>I think that most of us have in some way or other experienced love as risk and loss of control. We let ourselves trust someone we don't really know. There's a click. We change our lives because of the way someone looks at us, smiles at us, listens. </p> <p>Later, we must come out of the dark woods and return to ordinary life. We get mortgages, children, bank accounts, domestic squabbles and family routines. Our heart doesn't thump all the time. But it all begins with desire and longing and the sense that we can upturn our own life and begin afresh. So, in our story, Alice falls head-over-heels in love with Adam and puts herself in danger. </p> <p>The process of getting a novel published is partly about letting go. Sean and I wrote it together, passing it to and fro on our computers, and it was a secret, intimate exchange - particularly so since the novel's subject was erotic intimacy and trust. Then (in more or less this order) it was sent out to our agent, our editors, copy editors, family, friends, reviewers and finally our readers. Our grip on the book weakened; we let it go. </p> <p>That's the theory at least - but it's nothing compared to the letting go that takes place when a book is turned into a film. First the book was optioned by Montecito Pictures, a new production company created by Ivan Reitman (the director of Animal House and Ghostbusters) and Tom Pollock (who for many years was head of Universal Pictures). All that was a simple, uninhibited delight. 'Hollywood', you think, and you drink champagne (or sparkling wine, probably), and allow yourself a fantasy cast list, a dream of attending some glam premiere in a gown that miraculously makes you look like a film star yourself, a photograph in your addled head that shows you lying by a pool somewhere drinking cocktails. </p> <p> Everyone tells you not to get too excited (because few books ever make it beyond the option stage). You tell everybody not to get too excited (because ditto). You try to be casual about it. Cool and intelligent. No chance. The novel was optioned before it was published and we immediately ran into a problem. Montecito Pictures did not like its title: Crazy For Me. They thought it sounded too like a comedy or a musical. They wanted us to change it. For the book as well as for the film. </p> <p>We didn't mind that, as long as we could come up with a new name that everyone liked. We talked about it all the time, like expectant parents with a dictionary of names. We picked the brains of everyone we met. My eldest son was determined, for some unfathomable reason, that is should be called The Bus Driver. We thought about calling it Alice, Adam and Alice, On the Edge, Danger, Stranger, The Stranger, Abyss, Falling ... We came up with some truly dreadful names. </p> <p>One evening we went out for a meal with Sean's family, drank dry martinis, and came up with even more. The next morning we received an email from one of Sean's brothers, Karl, and his wife Fiona: they had continued drinking and name-chasing after they got home and had sent us a list of parodic suggestions. We have it still: An Affair to Forget (we think this is the most brilliantly bad title we've ever heard). Kiss Me, Kill Me (this must be some cheesy B movie title). Till I kissed You (ditto). Killing Me Softly. Stranger Love. Somebody New. One of the suggestions seemed rather good to us. </p> <p>You learn bit by bit what you always knew: that it isn't your book any longer, it is their film. The script was sent to us in its different stages, bristling with unfamiliar, curt instructions (POVs and INTs and EXTs and ECUs and VOS), and of course we looked at it and discovered that yes, some of the characters we'd created had disappeared; others we hadn't created had appeared. Scenes we'd laboured over had been snipped away. Plot lines were altered. The dialogue was sometimes unfamiliar, and sometimes it was written by us. The book came back in small glimpses and muffled echoes. </p> <p>But you know, it didn't matter because it was somebody else's raw material now, somebody else's inspiration or problem. We have four children who have colds, homework problems, loud voices, bad dreams, strange anxieties, sudden enthusiasms, big appetites and muddy shoes. We have other books to write. Killing Me Softly continued without us, on the other side of the Atlantic. Almost, we forgot about it. </p> <p>Then we heard that Heather Graham had agreed to play Alice. We looked at her on videos; sexy and touching. The great Chinese director Chen Kaige was going to be the director - his first film outside China. We watched Farewell My Concubine and The Emperor and the Assassin and were stunned by how epic and gorgeous they are. We blinked to think that what had started out as an idea we talked about in the car one day would become his film. </p> <p>We met the producers; met Chen Kaige. We heard that Joseph Fiennes was going to be Adam. We watched Shakespeare in Love and Elizabeth, and tried to picture his smouldering face without its beard. </p> <p>Books are so beautifully simple. Just the writer (or in our case the two writers) and the page or computer screen. Just words, and you can do anything you want - send your characters up mountains, plunge them into great crowds, take their clothes off, see them from a distance, get inside their heads. Films are so magnificently, insanely complicated, so intricate and cumbersome and expensive to make. I watched the shooting of the scene where Alice and Adam first meet, on that blue cold day. In the book we had briefly mentioned a passing lorry, a taxi, passing commuters - and now here they all were. They had had to be ordered, paid for, delivered. It was like seeing an army prepare for battle. </p> <p>We walked through a square where the caterers were parked. The area where buses and cars and cabs, hired for day, were parked. Past the trailers. Into a crowd of people working efficiently: producers, assistant producers, line producers, cameramen, make-up women, people in charge of lighting, sound, continuity; actors, stand-ins, extras who know they'll probably end up on the cutting room floor. So much painstaking attention to detail. So much numbing repetition; over and over again the extras blur past, over and over again Alice and Adam's eyes meet. </p> <p> We watched it on the director's monitor: one take stood out; nothing you could quite put your finger on, but there was a sense of rapture and terror in their faces. 'The camera loves her face,' said Chen Kaige softly, bundled up in a red padded jacket against the cold and staring intently at the screen. </p> <p>One day to make one minute. When you're writing you pretty much know if it's going well or not, but they say that you can never tell if a movie has worked until it is showing in a cinema. Frame by frame and second by second, it has to add up to more than the sum of its million parts. Something to do with magic. </p> <p>In a few days' time we are taking the four children to Shepperton Studios to see an hour or so of filming. We had to find a day when sexual content was low - just, I'm told, his hand up her dress. Some of Killing Me Softly has been filmed on a closed set, with only a handful of people allowed to see the rushes. </p> <p>Writing about sex can be suggestive and nuanced. In Killing Me Softly we wanted to saturate the relationship in eroticism without being explicit. It's harder to be suggestive in a film. The actors are flesh and blood, they must imitate the actions of besotted lovers. I recently saw the front-page photo from the shoot of Joseph Fiennes and Heather Graham kissing. Blood trickled down her face. Their lips bruised against each other. It looked so real and urgent and raw that I flinched. </p> <p>When a book is published it's like making a boat and pushing it out into the choppy waters and watching it to see if it floats or sinks. When you sell a book to be filmed, it's like watching the boat getting dismantled and rebuilt into a different craft altogether. This is not our film. We sold the book, and like some miracle it is now being shot, by one of the world's great directors who talks about colours and textures and can make ordinary things look gorgeous. We watch its progress now as startled, giggly outsiders, staring in on something which came from us and which we let go. Even when we were on the set we felt almost like trespassers in what had once been our own work. </p> <p>We only wrote about a woman who thinks she's ordinary and discovers how desirable she can be to a man who adores her. We saw Heather Graham convey it in the briefest of facial expressions. The hero is a mountain climber, and when we met Fiennes we talked about climbing. For our research into the subject we did some hiking, stayed in climbing hotels, read books. But Fiennes, who had never climbed before, prepared for the role by climbing in the Cairngorms with two top instructors. When filming stops he is going to do two things: star on stage as Edward II and go climbing again. He's a climber now. We're still just writers. </p> <p> To order Nicci French's latest novel Beneath the Skin for \u00a37.99. and Killing Me Softly for \u00a34.99 plus 99p p&amp;p, call Observer CultureShop on 0800 3168 171</p>",

We wanted to express, in the novel, the weirdness of falling in love, its disorder and irrationality and danger. I think that most of us have in some way or other experienced love as risk and loss of control. We let ourselves trust someone we don't really know. There's a click. We change our lives because of the way someone looks at us, smiles at us, listens. Later, we must come out of the dark woods and return to ordinary life. We get mortgages, children, bank accounts, domestic squabbles and family routines. Our heart doesn't thump all the time. But it all begins with desire and longing and the sense that we can upturn our own life and begin afresh. So, in our story, Alice falls head-over-heels in love with Adam and puts herself in danger. The process of getting a novel published is partly about letting go. Sean and I wrote it together, passing it to and fro on our computers, and it was a secret, intimate exchange - particularly so since the novel's subject was erotic intimacy and trust. Then (in more or less this order) it was sent out to our agent, our editors, copy editors, family, friends, reviewers and finally our readers. Our grip on the book weakened; we let it go. That's the theory at least - but it's nothing compared to the letting go that takes place when a book is turned into a film. First the book was optioned by Montecito Pictures, a new production company created by Ivan Reitman (the director of Animal House and Ghostbusters) and Tom Pollock (who for many years was head of Universal Pictures). All that was a simple, uninhibited delight. 'Hollywood', you think, and you drink champagne (or sparkling wine, probably), and allow yourself a fantasy cast list, a dream of attending some glam premiere in a gown that miraculously makes you look like a film star yourself, a photograph in your addled head that shows you lying by a pool somewhere drinking cocktails. Everyone tells you not to get too excited (because few books ever make it beyond the option stage). You tell everybody not to get too excited (because ditto). You try to be casual about it. Cool and intelligent. No chance. The novel was optioned before it was published and we immediately ran into a problem. Montecito Pictures did not like its title: Crazy For Me. They thought it sounded too like a comedy or a musical. They wanted us to change it. For the book as well as for the film. We didn't mind that, as long as we could come up with a new name that everyone liked. We talked about it all the time, like expectant parents with a dictionary of names. We picked the brains of everyone we met. My eldest son was determined, for some unfathomable reason, that is should be called The Bus Driver. We thought about calling it Alice, Adam and Alice, On the Edge, Danger, Stranger, The Stranger, Abyss, Falling ... We came up with some truly dreadful names. One evening we went out for a meal with Sean's family, drank dry martinis, and came up with even more. The next morning we received an email from one of Sean's brothers, Karl, and his wife Fiona: they had continued drinking and name-chasing after they got home and had sent us a list of parodic suggestions. We have it still: An Affair to Forget (we think this is the most brilliantly bad title we've ever heard). Kiss Me, Kill Me (this must be some cheesy B movie title). Till I kissed You (ditto). Killing Me Softly. Stranger Love. Somebody New. One of the suggestions seemed rather good to us. You learn bit by bit what you always knew: that it isn't your book any longer, it is their film. The script was sent to us in its different stages, bristling with unfamiliar, curt instructions (POVs and INTs and EXTs and ECUs and VOS), and of course we looked at it and discovered that yes, some of the characters we'd created had disappeared; others we hadn't created had appeared. Scenes we'd laboured over had been snipped away. Plot lines were altered. The dialogue was sometimes unfamiliar, and sometimes it was written by us. The book came back in small glimpses and muffled echoes. But you know, it didn't matter because it was somebody else's raw material now, somebody else's inspiration or problem. We have four children who have colds, homework problems, loud voices, bad dreams, strange anxieties, sudden enthusiasms, big appetites and muddy shoes. We have other books to write. Killing Me Softly continued without us, on the other side of the Atlantic. Almost, we forgot about it. Then we heard that Heather Graham had agreed to play Alice. We looked at her on videos; sexy and touching. The great Chinese director Chen Kaige was going to be the director - his first film outside China. We watched Farewell My Concubine and The Emperor and the Assassin and were stunned by how epic and gorgeous they are. We blinked to think that what had started out as an idea we talked about in the car one day would become his film. We met the producers; met Chen Kaige. We heard that Joseph Fiennes was going to be Adam. We watched Shakespeare in Love and Elizabeth, and tried to picture his smouldering face without its beard. Books are so beautifully simple. Just the writer (or in our case the two writers) and the page or computer screen. Just words, and you can do anything you want - send your characters up mountains, plunge them into great crowds, take their clothes off, see them from a distance, get inside their heads. Films are so magnificently, insanely complicated, so intricate and cumbersome and expensive to make. I watched the shooting of the scene where Alice and Adam first meet, on that blue cold day. In the book we had briefly mentioned a passing lorry, a taxi, passing commuters - and now here they all were. They had had to be ordered, paid for, delivered. It was like seeing an army prepare for battle. We walked through a square where the caterers were parked. The area where buses and cars and cabs, hired for day, were parked. Past the trailers. Into a crowd of people working efficiently: producers, assistant producers, line producers, cameramen, make-up women, people in charge of lighting, sound, continuity; actors, stand-ins, extras who know they'll probably end up on the cutting room floor. So much painstaking attention to detail. So much numbing repetition; over and over again the extras blur past, over and over again Alice and Adam's eyes meet. We watched it on the director's monitor: one take stood out; nothing you could quite put your finger on, but there was a sense of rapture and terror in their faces. 'The camera loves her face,' said Chen Kaige softly, bundled up in a red padded jacket against the cold and staring intently at the screen. One day to make one minute. When you're writing you pretty much know if it's going well or not, but they say that you can never tell if a movie has worked until it is showing in a cinema. Frame by frame and second by second, it has to add up to more than the sum of its million parts. Something to do with magic. In a few days' time we are taking the four children to Shepperton Studios to see an hour or so of filming. We had to find a day when sexual content was low - just, I'm told, his hand up her dress. Some of Killing Me Softly has been filmed on a closed set, with only a handful of people allowed to see the rushes. Writing about sex can be suggestive and nuanced. In Killing Me Softly we wanted to saturate the relationship in eroticism without being explicit. It's harder to be suggestive in a film. The actors are flesh and blood, they must imitate the actions of besotted lovers. I recently saw the front-page photo from the shoot of Joseph Fiennes and Heather Graham kissing. Blood trickled down her face. Their lips bruised against each other. It looked so real and urgent and raw that I flinched. When a book is published it's like making a boat and pushing it out into the choppy waters and watching it to see if it floats or sinks. When you sell a book to be filmed, it's like watching the boat getting dismantled and rebuilt into a different craft altogether. This is not our film. We sold the book, and like some miracle it is now being shot, by one of the world's great directors who talks about colours and textures and can make ordinary things look gorgeous. We watch its progress now as startled, giggly outsiders, staring in on something which came from us and which we let go. Even when we were on the set we felt almost like trespassers in what had once been our own work. We only wrote about a woman who thinks she's ordinary and discovers how desirable she can be to a man who adores her. We saw Heather Graham convey it in the briefest of facial expressions. The hero is a mountain climber, and when we met Fiennes we talked about climbing. For our research into the subject we did some hiking, stayed in climbing hotels, read books. But Fiennes, who had never climbed before, prepared for the role by climbing in the Cairngorms with two top instructors. When filming stops he is going to do two things: star on stage as Edward II and go climbing again. He's a climber now. We're still just writers.

      "byline": "Philip French",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The Marquis de Sade, the subject of Philip Kaufman's film Quills, has been provoking, enraging and puzzling people for more than two centuries now. Libertine or libertarian? Liberator or oppressor? Dispenser of lies or revealer of truths? Even entering the language has not tamed him. His chief influence on the cinema had been through his admirer Luis Bu\u00f1uel, whose films (even Robinson Crusoe) are steeped in de Sade's teachings.</p> <p>But there has been a succession of movies touching on de Sade these past 30-odd years. The Russian ambassador in Kubrick's Dr Strangelove is called DeSadesky. Peter Brook made a remarkable film of Peter Weiss's The Persecution and Assassination of Jean-Paul Marat as Performed by the Inmates of the Asylum at Charenton under the Direction of the Marquis de Sade, a debate about revolution that had been the highlight of Brook's RSC Theatre of Cruelty Season in 1964. </p> <p>In the 1969 American-German co-production De Sade, the marquis (a neurotic Keir Dullea) reviews his early life and the malign influence of his depraved uncle, the Abb\u00e9 de Sade (John Huston), and in 1990 there was the surreal French comedy, Marquis, set in the Bastille on the eve of the French Revolution, with the actors wearing masks and de Sade conducting conversations with his penis. Most controversial of all Sadean films is Salo, Pasolini's transposition of The 120 Days of Sodom from pre-revolutionary France to the last days of Mussolini's Italy, which was banned from exhibition in Britain for 25 years but has now been granted an '18' certificate. </p> <p>Adapted by Doug Wright from his own play, Quills is set in the early nineteenth century when de Sade (Geoffrey Rush), now in his late sixties, is imprisoned among the lunatics at Charenton, but is respected by its director, the Abb\u00e9 Coulmier (Joaquin Phoenix) who encourages him to write plays for his fellow inmates. The story is, however, largely fictitious, a sort of fantasia in the life, work and ideas of de Sade, that alternates between the tragic and the farcical, the absurd and the almost sublime. </p> <p>Kaufman's movies have always had an anti-authoritarian streak - he made his name with The Great Northfield Minnesota Raid, a western celebrating the James-Younger gang, and he played off the maverick Chuck Yeager against the conformist astronauts in The Right Stuff and made the literary rebel Henry Miller the hero of Henry and June. One can see the appeal for him of the marquis. </p> <p>Rush's de Sade is a run-down aristocrat, a subverter of order, reckless enemy of authority and propriety, a revolutionary who doesn't believe in progress. He's an old rou\u00e9 whose deeds now take place in the mind, less a sex maniac than a graphomaniac, compelled to write.

      "bodyText": "The Marquis de Sade, the subject of Philip Kaufman's film Quills, has been provoking, enraging and puzzling people for more than two centuries now. Libertine or libertarian? Liberator or oppressor? Dispenser of lies or revealer of truths? Even entering the language has not tamed him. His chief influence on the cinema had been through his admirer Luis Bu\u00f1uel, whose films (even Robinson Crusoe) are steeped in de Sade's teachings. But there has been a succession of movies touching on de Sade these past 30-odd years. The Russian ambassador in Kubrick's Dr Strangelove is called DeSadesky. Peter Brook made a remarkable film of Peter Weiss's The Persecution and Assassination of Jean-Paul Marat as Performed by the Inmates of the Asylum at Charenton under the Direction of the Marquis de Sade, a debate about revolution that had been the highlight of Brook's RSC Theatre of Cruelty Season in 1964. In the 1969 American-German co-production De Sade, the marquis (a neurotic Keir Dullea) reviews his early life and the malign influence of his depraved uncle, the Abb\u00e9 de Sade (John Huston), and in 1990 there was the surreal French comedy, Marquis, set in the Bastille on the eve of the French Revolution, with the actors wearing masks and de Sade conducting conversations with his penis. Most controversial of all Sadean films is Salo, Pasolini's transposition of The 120 Days of Sodom from pre-revolutionary France to the last days of Mussolini's Italy, which was banned from exhibition in Britain for 25 years but has now been granted an '18' certificate. Adapted by Doug Wright from his own play, Quills is set in the early nineteenth century when de Sade (Geoffrey Rush), now in his late sixties, is imprisoned among the lunatics at Charenton, but is respected by its director, the Abb\u00e9 Coulmier (Joaquin Phoenix) who encourages him to write plays for his fellow inmates. The story is, however, largely fictitious, a sort of fantasia in the life, work and ideas of de Sade, that alternates between the tragic and the farcical, the absurd and the almost sublime. Kaufman's movies have always had an anti-authoritarian streak - he made his name with The Great Northfield Minnesota Raid, a western celebrating the James-Younger gang, and he played off the maverick Chuck Yeager against the conformist astronauts in The Right Stuff and made the literary rebel Henry Miller the hero of Henry and June. One can see the appeal for him of the marquis. Rush's de Sade is a run-down aristocrat, a subverter of order, reckless enemy of authority and propriety, a revolutionary who doesn't believe in progress. He's an old rou\u00e9 whose deeds now take place in the mind, less a sex maniac than a graphomaniac, compelled to write. He's first seen in a brilliant, brief prologue observing from a window what we take to be a woman being happily ravaged by a masked man. The camera draws back to reveal she's an aristocrat about to be guillotined, and as the sadistic crowd roars, Kaufman cuts from her blood dripping from the blade to de Sade writing with red ink, the word and deed inseparable. A simple laundry girl, Madeleine (Kate Winslet), smuggles the marquis's erotic fictions from the asylum, handing them to an equestrian messenger from his publisher. Napoleon, affronted by the books and their erotic politics, is persuaded not to order his death but to send the vicious Dr Royer-Collard (Michael Caine in chillingly malevolent form) to Charenton to effect a cure. As monstrous as the doctor brought in to attend to the king in Alan Bennett's The Madness of George III, Collard is venal, self-seeking and a natural sadist with a child bride right out of one of the marquis's novels. A battle of wits ensues. He's initially opposed by the bien-pensant Abb\u00e9 Coulmier, but eventually the self-deluding representatives of State and Church join forces against the self-destructive de Sade. Through his very intransigence, the marquis wins at several levels, though he's physically destroyed in the process. There's a splendid succession of scenes in which de Sade, deprived of quills and paper, manages to keep on writing. He first writes in wine on bed linen for Madeleine (a virgin who lives imaginatively through Sade's wild fictions) to transcribe. Then, deprived of sheets and wine, he dictates the book sentence by sentence to the madman in the next cell, who passes it down the row until Madeleine puts in on paper at the end of the line. 'They might even improve it,' de Sade says about these lunatics transmitting his work. Finally, left naked in a dungeon, he writes on the walls in his own excrement. Quills strikes occasional false notes. One is not always sure whether certain lines are simply banal or are ironic jokes about banality. But it's a daring film in the ideas it embraces and in the manner in which it dramatises them. Shot on location at Sutton Hoo, in the streets of Oxford, and at the Old Naval College, Greenwich, with the jail scenes filmed at Pinewood Studios, it has been given an elegant, stylised look by its production designer Martin Childs (who won an Oscar for Shakespeare in Love) and the Dutch cinematographer Rogier Stoffers.

      "bodyText": "The killer of Congolese president Laurent Kabila was identified last night as an 18-year-old former boy soldier, who shot his leader through the head after summoning him from a meeting. The youth was then shot dead himself. Named only as Rashidi, the teenager had apparently been a follower of Kabila since the uprising in 1997 against President Mobutu Sese Seko. The tentative identifcation of the killer, who shot Kabila in the courtyard of his Marble Palace, cast little light on the motives for his murder. Many observers suspect Kabila was killed as part of a wider plot. His body, in a white-and-gold casket draped in the flag of the Democratic Republic of Congo, was flown to his home town of Lubumbashi yesterday, as it was announced that his son Joseph, 31, would be formally sworn in as his successor on Tuesday. In the first official account of Kabila's shooting at his hilltop palace in Kinshasa last Tuesday, Justice Minister Mwenze Kongolo said the president had been talking to an economic adviserbefore the assassin entered the room. 'The guard came in and it was natural for Kabila to listen to what he had to say,' Mwenze told a news conference in Kinshasa, explaining why the president had leaned forwards as the gunman opened fire. 'One of the bullets went right behind the ear and came right behind the ribs. I think that's the one that killed him,' Mwenze told a news conference in Kinshasa. 'Two other bullets went in the stomach but were not fatal. 'Those are the closest bodyguards that the president had. They are usually armed. The door was open so that air could circulate,' he said. Kabila, former revolutionary, dilettante and brothel keeper, who was thrust into the limelight as a figurehead for the invading Rwandan and Ugandan forces (with whom he latter fell out), will lie in state before being flown to the capital forthe funeral. A band played sombre music as military and government officials filed past the open coffin displayed in front of the June 30 Building, where his hand-picked National Assembly met. Congolese television reported that the cort\u00e8ge had trouble getting to its destination because thousands of people wanted to touch the coffin. It emerged that some West ern diplomats in Kinshasa had reported suspicions last week that the killing of Kabila showed signs of careful planning. Kabila's body had been loaded on to the presidential aircraft under the eyes of his former ally, President Robert Mugabe, as a Zimbabwean military band honoured the assassinated leader. A Congolese delegation escorted Kabila's body back to Congo. A state funeral is planned for Tuesday in Kinshasa. Mugabe, one of Kabila's key military allies, declared three days of mourning in Zimbabwe. Mugabe said his troops would continue to defend Congo from 'acts of aggression', the state-controlled media reported yesterday. Zimbabwe has 11,000 troops, backed by air power and armour, fighting alongside government forces in Congo's two-and-a-half-year civil war. Angola and Namibia, which also back the government, have said that they too will keep their troops in Congo for the time being. In Kinshasa the mood was one of resignation.'What do we care about generals and politicians?' said one shopkeeper, nervously on his guard against the thousands of government agents and informers that infest the city. 'We do not mind a coup that is for leaders. But we are afraid that, if the army does not accept the change, or if they are not paid, they will start looting.'",

      "body": "<p>In life John Osborne was full of fury. His writing brimmed with vitriol and his first great stage hit, Look Back In Anger, inspired a whole literary generation of 'angry young men'. 'Anger is good,' he once declared.</p> <p>Now, six years after the playwright's death, his work is once again at the centre of a storm of resentment. Osborne's widow, Helen, has received a 'bizarre and unfeeling' letter from her late husband's publishers, Faber and Faber, which has astonished her and many of the playwright's oldest friends.</p> <p>The letter, from managing director Tony Faber, requested repayment of the full figure of the advance - \u00a320,000 - that Osborne had been paid for the third volume of his autobiography.</p> <p>'As part of a general review exercise,' the letter read, 'we have been going through the outstanding advances on undelivered titles. According to our records, Autobiography Vol. III Young Men Forget by John Osborne falls into this category.'</p> <p>The first two volumes of Osborne's autobiography, A Better Class of Person and Almost A Gentleman, were published in 1981 and 1991, respectively. The third volume was under way, and the notes the author had prepared for it during his final illness are now kept at the University of Texas.</p> <p>By taking action to recover the money in the last few months of 2000, the publisher appears to have hoped to act before a six-year cut-off point for repayment. As far as Mrs Osborne is concerned, it has also conveniently forgotten the internationally renowned work, including the plays The Entertainer, Inadmissible Evidence and A Patriot For Me, which it has benefited from publishing.</p> <p>'He seems to be being penalised for dying,' the theatre director Richard Eyre said. 'They should remember that at one time he was certainly a major earner for Faber.'</p> <p>Mrs Osborne's outrage has been shared by several of her husband's former friends and fellow writers, including the playwrights Harold Pinter and David Hare. She has also been advised by the theatrical impresario Robert Fox, brother of the actors James and Edward. 'We are still hoping that this can be resolved,' Fox told The Observer. 'I believe they may be meeting to discuss it this week.'</p> <p>Mrs Osborne is trying to organise the repayment in instalments, but is believed to have been badly shaken by Faber's insistence.

      "bodyText": "In life John Osborne was full of fury. His writing brimmed with vitriol and his first great stage hit, Look Back In Anger, inspired a whole literary generation of 'angry young men'. 'Anger is good,' he once declared. Now, six years after the playwright's death, his work is once again at the centre of a storm of resentment. Osborne's widow, Helen, has received a 'bizarre and unfeeling' letter from her late husband's publishers, Faber and Faber, which has astonished her and many of the playwright's oldest friends. The letter, from managing director Tony Faber, requested repayment of the full figure of the advance - \u00a320,000 - that Osborne had been paid for the third volume of his autobiography. 'As part of a general review exercise,' the letter read, 'we have been going through the outstanding advances on undelivered titles. According to our records, Autobiography Vol. III Young Men Forget by John Osborne falls into this category.' The first two volumes of Osborne's autobiography, A Better Class of Person and Almost A Gentleman, were published in 1981 and 1991, respectively. The third volume was under way, and the notes the author had prepared for it during his final illness are now kept at the University of Texas. By taking action to recover the money in the last few months of 2000, the publisher appears to have hoped to act before a six-year cut-off point for repayment. As far as Mrs Osborne is concerned, it has also conveniently forgotten the internationally renowned work, including the plays The Entertainer, Inadmissible Evidence and A Patriot For Me, which it has benefited from publishing. 'He seems to be being penalised for dying,' the theatre director Richard Eyre said. 'They should remember that at one time he was certainly a major earner for Faber.' Mrs Osborne's outrage has been shared by several of her husband's former friends and fellow writers, including the playwrights Harold Pinter and David Hare. She has also been advised by the theatrical impresario Robert Fox, brother of the actors James and Edward. 'We are still hoping that this can be resolved,' Fox told The Observer. 'I believe they may be meeting to discuss it this week.' Mrs Osborne is trying to organise the repayment in instalments, but is believed to have been badly shaken by Faber's insistence. The Shropshire home she shared with the playwright during his final years has already been handed over to a charitable trust and his literary estate is now bankrupt. Towards the end of last year, she telephoned Faber to argue that the contract had simply been terminated, or 'frustrated', by her husband's death. She explained that 'it seems a bizarre and unfeeling interpretation to wait until a few scant weeks before his deadline to raise the matter for the first time'. Faber told The Observer he believed the matter could be resolved and he had suggested Mrs Osborne repay a proportion of the sum through deductions to royalties. 'It is simply not a sum we can afford to ignore,' he said. Adrian Laing, a legal expert at HarperCollins, said that contracts with authors usually carried a clause covering the conditions for repayment of an advance in the case of non-completion. 'It is an unusual situation but sometimes amounts can be deducted from the advance and another writer can be hired to complete the work,' he said. Fourth Estate is facing a similar problem. The firm had a six-figure deal with the QC George Carman and, after Carman's death earlier this year before the promised autobiography had been written, is now in negotiations with his son, the publisher Dominic Carman. Osborne led a turbulent life and by the time he died he had been in financial difficulties for some years. In spite of his series of award-winning plays and the screenwriting prowess that was evident in Tony Richardson's 1963 film Tom Jones, for which Osborne won an Oscar, the couple ran out of money. When Look Back In Anger, starring Alan Bates, Mary Ure and Kenneth Haigh, was first produced at George Devine's experimental Royal Court Theatre in 1956, Osborne was hailed as the brightest new talent in the country. The play gave birth to a whole new vocabulary and its central character, Jimmy Porter, became the archetypal 'anti-hero' of the age. The impact of the play was marked by Kenneth Tynan's review in this newspaper; he famously said he could never love someone who did not want to see Look Back In Anger. He added, in words that are now particularly pertinent, that underneath all the nasty invective in the play was 'the determination that no one who dies shall go unmourned'. The playwright married five times - to Pamela Lane, actress Mary Ure, Penelope Gilliat, by whom he had a daughter, Nolan, actress Jill Bennett, and Helen. Osborne's official biographer, John Halpern, said he would have loved to have read the third volume of the playwright's own memoirs. 'But he died. And I don't think anyone should hold that against him. Especially not the publishers he had been with for so long.'",

      "body": "<p>It was just after 8am on Friday and Annie Hornsby was running out of time. With Nelson Primary School in East London due to open its doors in less than an hour, Hornsby, the deputy head, was desperately trying to secure sick-cover for seven members of staff. All had phoned in complaining of flu. </p> <p>Outside her cramped office, the first of the school's 865 children were noisily arriving for morning lessons. The clatter in the concrete schoolyard grew louder as Hornsby wearily lifted the phone and called a fourth temp agency. It was a waste of time. </p> <p>Putting a pile of papers to one side, the smartly dressed deputy got to her feet. There was no other choice: the crippling staff shortages meant once again that she would take morning classes. The growing pile of paperwork would have to be taken home with her. Her weekend would be a working one. </p> <p>It was not the first time. Hornsby spent Friday morning the way she spends every morning, ringing round the teacher supply agencies in a dispiriting - and increasingly fruitless - search for staff. 'I have been in teaching for 15 years. I have never known it to be so bad,' she said after The Observer was given exclusive access to the school. </p> <p>Nelson is desperately trying to keep its head above water. As severe staff shortages bite, particularly in London and the South East, anger among teachers and parents over the deteriorating recruitment crisis is reaching boiling point. Ofsted inspectors last week closed another London primary school after they found it 'stretched almost to breaking point' by staff shortages. The school, the inspectors found, lacked even enough staff to teach the national curriculum. </p> <p>It is a fate that schools all over Britain, including Nelson, are desperate to avoid. Hornsby said: 'You come to work every day with this feeling of trepidation, fearing what will happen if someone is off. Last week I had a teacher who was obviously ill and had lost her voice, yet she was agonising about who would look after her class if she went home sick.' </p> <p>Across the way from Hornsby's office, Tim Benson, the head teacher, was also preparing to take a class. The business of managing and maintaining such a large school - one of the biggest in the country - would have to wait while he stepped into the breach for one of his absent staff. But he wasn't complaining: 'The shortages put a huge strain on staff, but it is the children who suffer most. </p> <p>'When a class doesn't have a permanent teacher it is quite noticeable, the children get fraught, their behaviour deteriorates,' he added. 'The perception is that inner-city schools are just daily grinds of challenging pupils and challenging parents; even the Ofsted inspector turned up here looking terrified. I think he thought he was going to get mugged.' </p> <p>This 100-year old London primary school, like so many others in England and Wales, is almost always under-staffed. Benson has 28 teachers and 50 other staff in his care. Seven of his teachers are supply teachers: two Australians, two South Africans, two New Zealanders and a Canadian. 'I don't know what we would do without them,' he said. </p> <p>They often work a 50-hour week and take plenty of extra work home. Half their pupils do not speak English as a first language and many have impossibly difficult backgrounds. Poverty is endemic: two-thirds of the children qualify for free school meals, and for some the school uniform is their only set of clothes. </p> <p>Three years ago things were much worse. Fights erupted between pupils daily and racist name-calling was a major problem. Nelson also suffered regular breakdowns of discipline in the classroom and academic standards were in freefall. But a new and dedicated head teacher in Benson, coupled with investment from the Government and Newham local education authority, have turned it around. The Department for Education has even agreed to pay \u00a31.4 million to fix the leaking roof. </p> <p>'We have all worked amazingly hard and have the results to prove it,' said the head teacher last week. But the recruitment crisis is now threatening to reverse all the hard work and once again bring it to its knees. 'What we cannot beat is the crisis in staff. It is really quite frightening, the one thing which makes me feel closest to despair,' said Benson. By taking classes themselves, Benson and Hornsby, his deputy, have been able to avoid having to send children home. Such a move could trigger unwanted attention from Ofsted. </p> <p>But these are desperate measures to shore up an ever-crumbling system and they cannot hold out for much longer. 'It is like putting a sticking plaster over a gaping wound,' said the head. 'The irony is that I have the money, I have a supply budget sitting in the bank, I cannot get staff, and when I do I have to maintain a massive charm offensive and an exhausting level of support in order to keep them. </p> <p>'We have built something good here but it needs maintaining every day. It's very easy, especially in this recruitment crisis, for a school's standards to plummet quite quickly and the weak can only get weaker,' said Benson. 'But we have lovely children, lovely parents, this is a lovely building. Children are children are children wherever you are and they deserve the best we can possibly give them, but we are not always able to get them the best.' </p> <p>Every year a large proportion of the children arrive speaking Ukrainian, Russian, Tamil, Albanian and Punjabi. They learn the basics of the language before beginning the long road to reach the standard of English, maths and science which the Government is demanding. There are also a large number of children with special needs, including those with dyslexia and severe behavioural problems. </p> <p>Britain has always relied heavily on teachers coming to the UK from Commonwealth countries. Despite his seven supply teachers, Benson will be monitoring the results of a mission to South Africa this week by a group of heads desperate to recruit badly needed staff. One of Britain's biggest teacher supply agencies, TimePlan, said last week that 2,000 Australian supply teachers will be snapped up this year. </p> <p>But even that outlet may soon run dry, leaving British schools even more badly exposed. Australian experts last week estimated their shortage of teachers would reach crisis point in the next four years. A campaign will soon be launched to persuade Australian teachers planning to head for Britain to stay at home instead. </p> <p>The Australian move comes as Britain steps up its poaching efforts. Last week the Education Minister Estelle Morris announced the latest in a line of proposals to boost teacher numbers. Red tape will be cut to make it possible for overseas teachers to stay longer than the current four months in any one post. Plans are already under way to amend pension legislation to lure former teachers out of retirement. </p> <p>The Government's recruitment drive will also have to convince foreign supply teachers to ignore the grim stories told by colleagues who have returned home, tired and demoralised after their time in Britain. Typical was Fiona Ballinger, from Queensland, who taught English and history at Forest Hill Boys School near Crystal Palace, south London. </p> <p>'It was hard, hard, hard work,' she told The Observer . 'Every Australian teacher has a nightmare story to tell from England. We only get 10 sick days a year in Queensland, but in Britain the teachers seemed to be sick all the time. Us supply teachers didn't even have to wait for a call. We just went to work knowing there would be people off sick,' she said. </p> <p>'Working in a school with closed-circuit cameras was bizarre. Never had anything like that in Australia. But a couple of times I was really scared and I understood why they had them. Two boys had a fight with saws and knives in my class one day, and this was about the time when the headmaster, Philip Lawrence, was stabbed to death.' </p> <p>Differences in vocabulary and an unfamiliar discipline system were quoted by foreign teachers last week as the biggest problems in British schools. One said: 'The first day in a class I leaned over a desk and got a pencil shoved up my bottom from behind. Later I had a dog mess in my bag and my friend got a black eye from another kid. I quickly learnt that the laid-back Australian way was not going to work here. </p> <p>'But I found the whole system so formal and the pupils just so unruly and downright nasty. The schools were in a fairly terrible state too, it wasn't pleasant and I got out as soon as I could - a shame because all I ever wanted to do was teach.' </p> <p>Another gripe was teachers' pay. At Nelson Primary, a teacher with less than nine years' experience gets around \u00a316,000, barely enough to get a mortgage on a one-bedroom flat in the area. </p> <p>Benson was doing his best last week to stay positive. He knows that the years of good work to turn his school around could be at stake if the Government cannot attract more teachers. But at least on Friday, things were ticking over. Year One children sat quietly on their classroom floor listening to a story being read out by a BT employee, sponsored by the phone company to help provide children, especially Afro-Caribbean boys, with a black male role model. </p> <p>Benson gestured through an open classroom door at one group of spellbound children. 'Learning, look, they are learning,' he beamed. 'There is the rewards of teaching. Just look at that.' He does not know how long it can last. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:tracy.mcveigh@observer.co.uk\">tracy.mcveigh@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

      "body": "<p>The story sounds too good to be true, but I have it on excellent authority that this salutary tale is authentic. On his arrival at the Foreign Office, Robin Cook had installed a hotline to the American Secretary of State. With considerable satisfaction did the Foreign Secretary show visitors to his chambers the impressive-looking item of gadgetry that would connect him quicker than you could say 'Special Relationship' to his opposite number in Washington.</p> <p>A fortnight passed and, rather to the disappointment of its proud owner, the wonder phone did not ring. At last, in the middle of a meeting, the hotline emitted its urgent trill. Amid much excitement, one of the Foreign Secretary's officials dashed to grab the receiver. The voice at the other end began to dictate an order for a takeaway pizza.</p> <p>This government has been no more immune than its predecessors to self-delusion about Britain's place in the American scheme of things. To the arrival of George W. Bush in the White House, bringing with him a regime which challenges the cherished myths about the relationship, London has reacted by wrapping itself in a duvet of more illusion.</p> <p>The inauguration of Dubya moves the Foreign Secretary to gush over the 'uniquely warm friendship' between the two countries. The relationship will 'renew and deepen', sighs Robin Cook, the erstwhile firebreath of the Left apparently so suffused with passion for this right-wing President that his empurpled prose suggests an alternative vocation as a writer of romantic fiction.</p> <p>Diplomatic etiquette demands the maintenance of the pretence that nothing has really changed. Assuming that the briefers from the CIA have now cleared up any lingering confusion in Dubya's mind between Britain and Burundi, it will be superficial business as usual. Though Tony Blair clearly preferred Al Gore, Number 10 was careful to hedge its bets. Mr Cook took the precaution of meeting Colin Powell many months ago. Chris Meyer and his team at the British embassy in Washington have assiduously cultivated players of influence in the Republican White House.</p> <p>On a personal level, Tony and Dubya can be expected to get along just dandy.

      "bodyText": "The story sounds too good to be true, but I have it on excellent authority that this salutary tale is authentic. On his arrival at the Foreign Office, Robin Cook had installed a hotline to the American Secretary of State. With considerable satisfaction did the Foreign Secretary show visitors to his chambers the impressive-looking item of gadgetry that would connect him quicker than you could say 'Special Relationship' to his opposite number in Washington. A fortnight passed and, rather to the disappointment of its proud owner, the wonder phone did not ring. At last, in the middle of a meeting, the hotline emitted its urgent trill. Amid much excitement, one of the Foreign Secretary's officials dashed to grab the receiver. The voice at the other end began to dictate an order for a takeaway pizza. This government has been no more immune than its predecessors to self-delusion about Britain's place in the American scheme of things. To the arrival of George W. Bush in the White House, bringing with him a regime which challenges the cherished myths about the relationship, London has reacted by wrapping itself in a duvet of more illusion. The inauguration of Dubya moves the Foreign Secretary to gush over the 'uniquely warm friendship' between the two countries. The relationship will 'renew and deepen', sighs Robin Cook, the erstwhile firebreath of the Left apparently so suffused with passion for this right-wing President that his empurpled prose suggests an alternative vocation as a writer of romantic fiction. Diplomatic etiquette demands the maintenance of the pretence that nothing has really changed. Assuming that the briefers from the CIA have now cleared up any lingering confusion in Dubya's mind between Britain and Burundi, it will be superficial business as usual. Though Tony Blair clearly preferred Al Gore, Number 10 was careful to hedge its bets. Mr Cook took the precaution of meeting Colin Powell many months ago. Chris Meyer and his team at the British embassy in Washington have assiduously cultivated players of influence in the Republican White House. On a personal level, Tony and Dubya can be expected to get along just dandy. George Bush Senior says of his son: 'He has no sharp edges. He is no ideologue, no divider.' That is a character reference which could be equally applied to Mr Blair. One of the Prime Minister's intimates assures me that any obstacles will be dissolved in a warm bath of personal chemistry. 'Tony is a nice guy. Bush is a nice guy. I'm sure they'll get along like a house on fire.' The unpleasant reality that they are anxious to mask, as much from themselves as anyone else, is that the new order in Washington brings into vivid relief the question that has confronted Britain ever since it lost its empire.

The writer's sense of the absurd would have been equally tickled by Polly Toynbee's reaction to his demise, last week.

But those with trusts in their portfolios could be forgiven for thinking that this industry is already cuddled rather too comfortably together. </p> <p>The affair of Sierra Trading, a New Jersey arbitrage fund, raises important issues. The fund took stakes in a number of investment trusts last summer. It followed this up by requisitioning a resolution to be put to the annual meetings of four of them - Foreign &amp; Colonial, Scottish Investment Trust, Bankers and Murray International - calling on the funds to buy back a hefty 70 per cent of their shares at 98 per cent of their net asset value. </p> <p>Within weeks of the resolutions being tabled, all four trusts had bought Sierra's stakes, leaving it with a decent profit - and other shareholders, who were not given the same chance of an exit, with a nasty taste in their mouths. </p> <p>One investor, Hermes, is asking whether the affair heralds the arrival in Britain of 'greenmail', a particularly nasty US practice in which one company takes a stake in another and threatens a full-scale bid or other unwelcome corporate action unless the target firm buys it out at a handsome profit. </p> <p>Hermes is asking the trusts for an explanation of their dealings with Sierra Trading, which certainly have all the hallmarks of greenmail - although they deny all suggestions of it. </p> <p>F &amp; C, for example, points out that it offered all shareholders the chance to sell on the same terms as Sierra. Indeed, it bought in 36 million shares in one day, of which fewer than a third were Sierra's. </p> <p>But Hermes questions why, in the case of Scottish, it was allowed to sell only 30 per cent of its holding when Sierra got a complete exit. </p> <p>The trusts do deserve some sympathy. The sector is a favourite for arbitrageurs and, too often, their actions do little to benefit other shareholders. F &amp; C points out that putting the resolution to its investors would have incurred substantial printing, advisory and legal costs- money which might well have been wasted. </p> <p>But the trusts should be doing more to stop attacks by arbitrageurs in the first place. Trusts are vulnerable because of their discounts - the fact that their share prices are lower than the value of their underlying assets. </p> <p>Abitrageurs aim to buy at big discounts and sell at smaller ones, or even force the break-up of a trust. </p> <p>The best way to deter them, therefore, is to keep the discount as low as possible. Above all, that means performing well. But it also means ensuring their shareholders actually want to hold their shares. Too many shares in the large general trusts are in the hands of big institutions. Trusts should be buying back more shares, not just buying out arbitraguers such as Sierra, and doing more to sell themselves to private shareholders, for whom they are excellent investments. </p> <p>The industry's 'its' campaign, of which the advert is part, has had a small impact. The rest is up to the trusts.</p>",

One investor, Hermes, is asking whether the affair heralds the arrival in Britain of 'greenmail', a particularly nasty US practice in which one company takes a stake in another and threatens a full-scale bid or other unwelcome corporate action unless the target firm buys it out at a handsome profit. Hermes is asking the trusts for an explanation of their dealings with Sierra Trading, which certainly have all the hallmarks of greenmail - although they deny all suggestions of it. F &amp; C, for example, points out that it offered all shareholders the chance to sell on the same terms as Sierra. Indeed, it bought in 36 million shares in one day, of which fewer than a third were Sierra's. But Hermes questions why, in the case of Scottish, it was allowed to sell only 30 per cent of its holding when Sierra got a complete exit. The trusts do deserve some sympathy. The sector is a favourite for arbitrageurs and, too often, their actions do little to benefit other shareholders. F &amp; C points out that putting the resolution to its investors would have incurred substantial printing, advisory and legal costs- money which might well have been wasted. But the trusts should be doing more to stop attacks by arbitrageurs in the first place. Trusts are vulnerable because of their discounts - the fact that their share prices are lower than the value of their underlying assets. Abitrageurs aim to buy at big discounts and sell at smaller ones, or even force the break-up of a trust. The best way to deter them, therefore, is to keep the discount as low as possible. Above all, that means performing well. But it also means ensuring their shareholders actually want to hold their shares. Too many shares in the large general trusts are in the hands of big institutions. Trusts should be buying back more shares, not just buying out arbitraguers such as Sierra, and doing more to sell themselves to private shareholders, for whom they are excellent investments. The industry's 'its' campaign, of which the advert is part, has had a small impact. The rest is up to the trusts.",

It could also explain why there's so much pressure to join in. These days, food tries so hard to gratify the senses, that, like a bad dancer from the 70s, it seems that if you don't respond to every dish with a Linda Lovelace orgasm-face, or if you dare to admit that you're not interested in some new lettuce, you're somehow deemed to be Bad in Bed. </p> <p>In the light of all this food-obsession, it seems strangely cheering that a new study reports a trend for young British professionals to choose flats which either have very small kitchens or no kitchen at all, preferring to eat out, or snack on takeaways, Big Apple style.

There is also the fact that when I read Hanif Kureshi's poisonous attack on his ex-wife in his novel Intimacy, which primarily focused on her being 'the kind of woman who reads recipe books in bed', the knee-jerk feminist in me said, 'Toe-rag' while some sneaky inner voice which could not be silenced, muttered, 'I'm on his side.' </p> <p>So, clearly, I am not madly interested in food.

While someone rightly pointed out to me that, unlike say Porsches, holidays, or designer clothes, nice food is an affordable luxury, a bolt of cheap glamour we can all enjoy, this still seems to automatically exclude the housewife on income support, budgeting for a family on the same amount of money a Chelsea frau would spend on the right kind of salad fungi. When it comes to a tray of dried ceps, or a bag of oven chips and a few tins of baked beans which will feed the kids for four days, both the rich and the poor know exactly what their choice would be. </p> <p>Which, depressingly, seems to be the point. Food remains nowhere near as sensual as it is political. Even in these supposedly enlightened times, food is a socially divisive tool, class war on a dinner plate, which automatically, irreversibly, separates the middle classes from the working classes. That, it seems, is where our present obsession with 'good food' originates - the same bad place where privilege and snobbery have always come from. Why else would the middle classes of the 90s delight in intimidating the working classes with their obscure cheese shavings? Just as they once did with their finger bowls and their ridiculous gluts of unnecessary cutlery in the 70s? Because they're hungry, because there's a hole to fill? Of course they are and of course there is. Just not in the way they'd like you to think. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:barbara.ellen@observer.co.uk\">barbara.ellen@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

When it comes to a tray of dried ceps, or a bag of oven chips and a few tins of baked beans which will feed the kids for four days, both the rich and the poor know exactly what their choice would be. Which, depressingly, seems to be the point. Food remains nowhere near as sensual as it is political. Even in these supposedly enlightened times, food is a socially divisive tool, class war on a dinner plate, which automatically, irreversibly, separates the middle classes from the working classes. That, it seems, is where our present obsession with 'good food' originates - the same bad place where privilege and snobbery have always come from. Why else would the middle classes of the 90s delight in intimidating the working classes with their obscure cheese shavings? Just as they once did with their finger bowls and their ridiculous gluts of unnecessary cutlery in the 70s? Because they're hungry, because there's a hole to fill? Of course they are and of course there is. Just not in the way they'd like you to think. barbara.ellen@observer.co.uk",

      "body": "<p>An international campaign to cancel the foreign debts of the poorest countries by 31 December 2000 ended with rhetoric and promises but only a tiny amount actually written off by creditor governments. </p> <p>The London-based Jubilee 2000 coalition of 100 voluntary groups ran a four-year, high-profile campaign to cancel the unpayable debts of 52 heavily indebted countries and so release funds for anti-poverty projects. These countries have debts of $375 billion, of which Jubilee 2000 estimates that about $300bn is unpayable. In 1998 it cost them $23.4bn to service their debt. Most is owed to government departments in OECD countries, the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and aid agencies. As much of this debt has already been discounted, says Jubilee 2000, its cancellation would cost very little. </p> <p>Despite huge international support, including the world's largest petition, signed by 24 million people in 166 countries, and backing from religious leaders and pop stars such as Bono and Bob Geldof, the campaign fell short of its objective but put debt on the international agenda. 'Faced with one of the biggest movements for change the world has even seen it's shameful that creditors have not done more,' said Jubilee 2000 director Ann Pettifor, who now plans to run a successor - Jubilee Plus. 'They have yet to give the world poor a fresh start in the new millennium.' </p> <p>Among debt campaigners there is anger about the role of the World Bank and the IMF, which administer the heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC) initiative, the main debt relief vehicle. The limited nature of debt-reduction packages, which the World Bank and IMF topped up in late December, has now become apparent. </p> <p>While the Group of Seven industrialised nations promised the cancellation of $110bn of debt, only one country, Uganda, has had debt cancelled, while reductions have been agreed for a further 21 countries. Packages for seven of these were only agreed at the World Bank and IMF the week before Christmas, although the HIPC initiative is four years old. Qualifying countries may have to wait for several years - until they have poverty reduction strategies that satisfy World Bank and IMF criteria - before their debt is finally written off. In the meantime, debt servicing - the amount they pay in interest and capital repayments - will be reduced from $2.8bn to $2bn a year. </p> <p>'What we have achieved should not be minimised,' said World Bank president James Wolfensohn. But that's exactly what has been achieved - a minimal deal. </p> <p>The 22 qualifying countries are relatively small, with a combined population of around 205 million. But the 52 most heavily indebted countries have a joint population of more than 1,030 million. Countries enjoying a reduction in annual debt servicing therefore account for only 20 per cent of the population of the 52 countries. Even more telling is that the reduction, some $800 million, amounts to a mere 3.4 per cent of the total annual debt service payment of the 52 countries. </p> <p>Axel van Trotsenburg, manager of HIPC implementation at the World Bank, says that 'over time' the 22 countries can expect debt relief of $35bn. But this amounts to less than a third of the $110bn debt which the G7 promised to cancel. </p> <p>Van Trotsenburg said that to the $35bn can be added about $20bn more from 'existing debt-relief mechanisms as well as the unilateral initiatives by the respective OECD countries', making relief of about $55bn over time. But even this would be half-way to the G7 promise. </p> <p>According to Pettifor, the HIPC initiative 'is not deep enough to provide a lasting exit to the debt burdens faced by indebted countries. It moves far too slowly and is subject to increasingly discredited IMF austerity conditions'. Sixteen of the 22 countries with debt packages 'will still be spending more each year on debt than on health', she points out. </p> <p>Mauritania will be paying $63m on servicing its debt, but only $51m on education and $17m on health. Tanzania will pay out $168m in debt servicing compared to $87m on health. Zambia, where one in five adults is HIV-positive, will even be paying more on average after the HIPC initiative than before. </p> <p>Wolfensohn and IMF man aging director Horst Kohler said the Bank and Fund will continue working to bring debt relief 'to other poor countries that have yet to qualify for HIPC initiative assistance'. Among the 19 HIPC countries that have yet to qualify are war-torn states such as Burundi, Ethiopia, Sudan and Vietnam. </p> <p>Chancellor Gordon Brown announced last month that the British government would renounce its right 'to receive any benefit from these historic debts owed by the 41 countries'. Debt payments owed to the UK would be held in trust for poverty relief when each country agreed a poverty-reduction plan. </p> <p>But 11 countries lie outside the initiative, including Bangladesh, Haiti and Nigeria, whose debt profiles are not considered serious enough. According to Pettifor, however, 'all are in desperate need of debt cancellation'. Nigeria's debt per head is about $250, higher than at least six HIPC qualifiers and more than twice as high as Burkina Faso.Haiti is paying $60m a year to service its debt. </p> <p>'While conditions for ordinary people are getting worse every day,' said Camille Chalmers of Haiti's Jubilee 2000 campaign, 'this debt payment to the rich is immoral and profoundly unjust.' </p> <p>Jubilee 2000's success was to move debt cancellation close to the top of the agenda.'Nothing can stop us.

Sir David Steel, though undoubtedly urbane, is no Harrison Ford, but he must have wondered last week if he too had strayed into a work of psychic imagination.</p> <p>The presiding officer of the Scottish Parliament found himself embroiled in a strange procedural row which pitched him against Ministers of the Scottish Executive. He took responsibility for the earlier decision by his deputy, George Reid, which disbarred Finance Minister Angus MacKay from making a statement on the abolition of quangos.</p> <p>His reason? The substance of the announcement had already appeared in the morning papers. This was an affront to the Parliament. The remedy of banning the Ministerial statement carried the penalty that it would allow the opposition more time.</p> <p>But then it emerged that Reid's decision to make that ruling had itself been leaked to the press in advance. By whom, asked Parliament Minister Tom McCabe, none too politely? Could it have been Sir David's office or one of his two deputies?</p> <p>Certainly not, the presiding officer replied. But Sir David, who had already apologised for not having given MacKay advance warning of the ruling, now found himself on the defensive. He escaped the wrath of Ministers and MSPs by promising further discussions in private: what has emerged, in essence, is a leaks inquiry that includes not just the Executive but his own office too.</p> <p>Sir David noted that Betty Boothroyd, at Westminster, had fought a rearguard action against leaks at Westminster, eventually admitting defeat. He announced his own resolve to win the battle but now, more than a little bruised, sulks like David at the Cave of Adullam. But no army will rally to his cause: the harsh truth is that his is a lost cause.</p> <p>The late Donald Dewar kept a small group of spindoctors and advisers. Team McLeish is using the full budget allocation. According to the wits in Deacon Brodie's pub, he has even brought a spin doctor up from London among whose duties is to advise on his coiffure.

      "bodyText": "As every schoolboy knows, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? was the title of a cult science fiction novel, filmed as Blade Runner , which questioned the reality of existence and the nature of self. Sir David Steel, though undoubtedly urbane, is no Harrison Ford, but he must have wondered last week if he too had strayed into a work of psychic imagination. The presiding officer of the Scottish Parliament found himself embroiled in a strange procedural row which pitched him against Ministers of the Scottish Executive. He took responsibility for the earlier decision by his deputy, George Reid, which disbarred Finance Minister Angus MacKay from making a statement on the abolition of quangos. His reason? The substance of the announcement had already appeared in the morning papers. This was an affront to the Parliament. The remedy of banning the Ministerial statement carried the penalty that it would allow the opposition more time. But then it emerged that Reid's decision to make that ruling had itself been leaked to the press in advance. By whom, asked Parliament Minister Tom McCabe, none too politely? Could it have been Sir David's office or one of his two deputies? Certainly not, the presiding officer replied. But Sir David, who had already apologised for not having given MacKay advance warning of the ruling, now found himself on the defensive. He escaped the wrath of Ministers and MSPs by promising further discussions in private: what has emerged, in essence, is a leaks inquiry that includes not just the Executive but his own office too. Sir David noted that Betty Boothroyd, at Westminster, had fought a rearguard action against leaks at Westminster, eventually admitting defeat. He announced his own resolve to win the battle but now, more than a little bruised, sulks like David at the Cave of Adullam. But no army will rally to his cause: the harsh truth is that his is a lost cause. The late Donald Dewar kept a small group of spindoctors and advisers. Team McLeish is using the full budget allocation. According to the wits in Deacon Brodie's pub, he has even brought a spin doctor up from London among whose duties is to advise on his coiffure. Spies say, also, that McCabe masterminds the media strategy. Of course governments have always leaked. After the row over Westland helicopters, when Michael Heseltine resigned from the Cabinet, Mrs Thatcher and her spinmeister, Bernard Ingham, tried to draw a distinction between a 'leak' and 'authorised' guidance. It was Ingham, indeed, who developed spindoctoring into a kind of profession. He combined slick organisational skills with hectoring and bullying.

Now fresh research to be published in the British Medical Journal reveals that a tenth of blood clots treated at one London hospital were caused by sitting immobile on flights. If these figures were represented nationally it would point to 3,000 cases a year and 300 deaths, making death from a blood clot a greater risk than in a plane crash.</p> <p>Our investigation has also uncovered the first evidence that British pilots and aircrew have been victims of Deep Vein Thrombosis. At least five have been affected, including two who developed potentially deadly pulmonary embolisms. The Civil Aviation Authority last night confirmed it did know of cases of pilots with blood clots, but declined to divulge any further information, citing medical confidentiality.</p> <p>But one pilot, writing on the Professional Pilots' website, said: 'I can confirm that aircrew have in the past, and still do, suffer from DVT. I suffered a pulmonary embolism at the age of 37. Luckily, after three months off, the CAA reissued my class one. Recently a colleague suffered the same fate and luckily he survived as I did. I sincerely hope no one suffers the same fate, but unfortunately it does happen.'</p> <p>Labour MP Tam Dalyell last night accused the CAA of 'passing by on the other side of the road' and described official attitudes to DVT as 'appalling'.</p> <p>'I shall be putting down parliamentary questions to John Prescott and will write to him, showing him The Observer's evidence. I shall continue to raise this issue for as long as it takes,' said Dalyell.</p> <p>'There is credible evidence of, at least, a serious problem. In a situation where airlines for financial reasons are under pressure to increase the number of bottoms on seats and therefore reduce leg-room, it is essential that we have objective medical opinion and a truthful statement of the number of air travellers who have suffered.'</p> <p>Yesterday it emerged that the youngest-ever chief executive of advertising giant J Walter Thompson, Chris Jones, has taken early retirement after being stricken by flight-related DVT. He collapsed after stepping off a New York to Switzerland flight. Doctors told him he was lucky to survive.</p> <p>British Airways has declined to take part in medical studies of 'economy class syndrome' proposed by Professor Kevin Burnand, head of surgery at Guy's, King's and St Thomas's Hospitals, and Dr Patrick Kesteven of Newcastle University. The doctors wanted access to the airline's passengers before and after air travel so that a scientific study of the relationship between flying and blood clotting could be undertaken.</p> <p>In Australia, Professor Reginald Lord, a surgeon at St Vincent's Hospital and professor of surgery at the University of New South Wales, approached Qantas in 1993 to carry out a study but the airline's board rejected the proposal.</p> <p>Research by surgeon John Scurr of University College Hospital, London, to be published shortly in the Lancet, will show that long-haul flights can cause blood clots. Some 200 passengers were tested by ultra-sound before flying and were found to have no clots. After flying, 10 per cent had blood clots.</p> <p>Evidence gathered in the hospitals closest to Gatwick shows that doctors there see 100 people a year who suffer from deep vein thrombosis, of whom about 8 per cent die or are dead on arrival.</p> <p>If the new figures from Ealing Hospital are represented nationally, the figure of 300 deaths could be a conservative estimate. Mr Scurr told The Observer: 'I suspect the figure of deaths caused by blood clots on flights to be in hundreds every year.'</p> <p>The Observer knows of at least seven cases of people suffering blood clots on return flights. They are:</p> <p>\u0095 Val Clark, now 60, of Gateshead, who flew back from the States in 1995. Doctors amputated her left leg below the knee because of a blood clot.</p> <p>\u0095 Pamela Davidson, a healthy 64-year-old who flew from Australia to London for her daughter's wedding. She died on the return journey over Alice Springs in July 1998.</p> <p>\u0095 Lord Graham of Edmonton who, flying Club Class from Australia, developed a severe pain in his right leg.</p> <p>\u0095 Dentist Ann Egerton whose life was saved by her GP husband on a BA flight back from South Africa.</p> <p>\u0095 Emma Christoffersen, a 28-year-old bride-to-be who died in October on a return flight.</p> <p>\u0095 Policeman John Thomas, who died last year after a return flight from Hawaii.</p> <p>\u0095 Angie Ruby, who died 14 days after stepping off the return journey from Cuba.</p>",

If these figures were represented nationally it would point to 3,000 cases a year and 300 deaths, making death from a blood clot a greater risk than in a plane crash. Our investigation has also uncovered the first evidence that British pilots and aircrew have been victims of Deep Vein Thrombosis. At least five have been affected, including two who developed potentially deadly pulmonary embolisms. The Civil Aviation Authority last night confirmed it did know of cases of pilots with blood clots, but declined to divulge any further information, citing medical confidentiality. But one pilot, writing on the Professional Pilots' website, said: 'I can confirm that aircrew have in the past, and still do, suffer from DVT. I suffered a pulmonary embolism at the age of 37. Luckily, after three months off, the CAA reissued my class one. Recently a colleague suffered the same fate and luckily he survived as I did. I sincerely hope no one suffers the same fate, but unfortunately it does happen.' Labour MP Tam Dalyell last night accused the CAA of 'passing by on the other side of the road' and described official attitudes to DVT as 'appalling'. 'I shall be putting down parliamentary questions to John Prescott and will write to him, showing him The Observer's evidence. I shall continue to raise this issue for as long as it takes,' said Dalyell. 'There is credible evidence of, at least, a serious problem. In a situation where airlines for financial reasons are under pressure to increase the number of bottoms on seats and therefore reduce leg-room, it is essential that we have objective medical opinion and a truthful statement of the number of air travellers who have suffered.' Yesterday it emerged that the youngest-ever chief executive of advertising giant J Walter Thompson, Chris Jones, has taken early retirement after being stricken by flight-related DVT. He collapsed after stepping off a New York to Switzerland flight. Doctors told him he was lucky to survive. British Airways has declined to take part in medical studies of 'economy class syndrome' proposed by Professor Kevin Burnand, head of surgery at Guy's, King's and St Thomas's Hospitals, and Dr Patrick Kesteven of Newcastle University. The doctors wanted access to the airline's passengers before and after air travel so that a scientific study of the relationship between flying and blood clotting could be undertaken. In Australia, Professor Reginald Lord, a surgeon at St Vincent's Hospital and professor of surgery at the University of New South Wales, approached Qantas in 1993 to carry out a study but the airline's board rejected the proposal. Research by surgeon John Scurr of University College Hospital, London, to be published shortly in the Lancet, will show that long-haul flights can cause blood clots. Some 200 passengers were tested by ultra-sound before flying and were found to have no clots. After flying, 10 per cent had blood clots. Evidence gathered in the hospitals closest to Gatwick shows that doctors there see 100 people a year who suffer from deep vein thrombosis, of whom about 8 per cent die or are dead on arrival. If the new figures from Ealing Hospital are represented nationally, the figure of 300 deaths could be a conservative estimate. Mr Scurr told The Observer: 'I suspect the figure of deaths caused by blood clots on flights to be in hundreds every year.' The Observer knows of at least seven cases of people suffering blood clots on return flights. They are: \u0095 Val Clark, now 60, of Gateshead, who flew back from the States in 1995. Doctors amputated her left leg below the knee because of a blood clot. \u0095 Pamela Davidson, a healthy 64-year-old who flew from Australia to London for her daughter's wedding. She died on the return journey over Alice Springs in July 1998. \u0095 Lord Graham of Edmonton who, flying Club Class from Australia, developed a severe pain in his right leg. \u0095 Dentist Ann Egerton whose life was saved by her GP husband on a BA flight back from South Africa. \u0095 Emma Christoffersen, a 28-year-old bride-to-be who died in October on a return flight. \u0095 Policeman John Thomas, who died last year after a return flight from Hawaii. \u0095 Angie Ruby, who died 14 days after stepping off the return journey from Cuba.",

Ministers yesterday promised urgent reforms as the furore over Alan and Judith Kilshaw, the couple who bought their infant twins from an American broker over the internet, intensified. The Kilshaw case exposed loopholes through which potentially unsuitable couples could dodge child welfare safeguards by adopting overseas. Under measures to be rushed through by April, the Government will make it a criminal offence punishable by jail or a fine to adopt from other countries without first going through the same strict checks as couples wanting to adopt in Britain. 'Adoption is a service for children, it's not a service for adults,' said Health Secretary Alan Milburn. \"We want more children to be adopted which is why we are reforming the system to make it fairer and faster, but in doing so the interests of the child will always come first.

In a move which threatens to reopen old government wounds on the issue, Joschka Fischer, the German Foreign Minister and a strong advocate of a European super-state, will use a joint press conference with Cook to discuss the future of federalism on the Continent. Cook's agreement to appear will be seized on by Eurosceptics as evidence that he remains keen to take a leading role in the European debate. The move will come after fresh criticism of the Government by one of the Continent's most respected military leaders over its agreement to join the European Rapid Reaction Force . In an interview with The Observer , General Klaus Naumann, former head of Nato's military committee, said the project to deploy up to 12,000 British troops in European peace-keeping activities around the world was ill thought out and threatened Europe's relationship with the United States. Fischer, a firm supporter of the new force, was damned by anti-European campaigners when he gave a speech last May saying that the EU would have to proceed towards a federal structure if it was to succeed.

If he opens his restaurant too early it fills up with Western businessmen and he cannot seat the local officials whose influence he needs to keep the place open. But if he raises the fake drawbridge of the Castello - Baghdad's latest fashionable nightspot - too late in the evening the staff will not get the tips they have come to expect and they are likely to mutiny.</p> <p>But al-Suhail knows it is not much of a problem. Jammed in the road outside the four-month-old fake fort are rows of Mercedes, BMWs and Japanese 4x4s. Most of his tables have been booked for days. 'I've been in worse situations in the last 10 years,' he says. He smiles and crosses his arms and his silver watchstrap reflects the neon that glares from the false battlements above.</p> <p>He is not alone in his high spirits. From the nouveaux riches sampling the Castello's ch\u00e2teaubriand to the beggars who have barely tasted meat in a decade, everyone in Baghdad agrees that things are looking up. Once, the city's streets were full of rubble and stank of sewage, rotting rubbish, violence and fear. Now - as the trade embargo imposed after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait moves into its 11th year - they are full of traffic, brightly lit shops and consumer goods. There are still spots of appalling misery and deprivation, but everyone says things are changing, that the worst is over, that they have survived.</p> <p>In fact, they have done more than survive. Baghdad is now a city where $35,000 cars are bought within minutes of being driven into showrooms, where women in leopardskin coats and miniskirts go to the National Theatre to watch the latest avant-garde plays, where you can get a PlayStation2 without waiting, where the caf\u00e9s are full until late and markets open around the clock.</p> <p>Baghdad is also a city that is proud: proud of having survived the sanctions, proud of having survived three bouts of bombing by US and British planes, and proud, above all, of the man whose heavy, jowly features are on a wall in every office and classroom, on a corner on every street, on 20ft-high posters, placards and banners, on book covers, newspapers and magazines.</p> <p>Last Wednesday - the anniversary of the start of the air war in the Gulf - Saddam Hussein, now 63, received a 21-gun salute and addressed the nation on television. He spoke of the great victory won in the Umm al-Marrik (Mother of all Battles) against the 650,000-strong allied forces 10 years ago. The victory, he said, was continuing and growing. The Iraqi people, and the Arab and the Islamic worlds, could expect further greatness in the years to come.</p> <p>Saddam's satisfaction is understandable. Ten years ago he was a pariah. Defeated militarily and diplomatically, his economy was in tatters and his hold on power looked shaky. Now everything is different.</p> <p>The 500-mile-long road from Jordan to Baghdad cuts across one of the bleakest, hottest deserts in the world. Only when you reach the Euphrates, after 10 hours of driving, does green begin to spatter the dirty, blasted monotony of sand and rock. But, though long, it is a surprisingly easy drive. The road from the Jordanian capital of Amman may be crowded, bumpy and narrow, but once across the border, and past a recent statue of a sword-wielding Saddam on a rearing horse flanked by four flaring Scuds, you hurtle along a new six-lane motorway complete with laybys and picnic spots.</p> <p>On the old road that still runs parallel, a stream of trucks and tankers rumbles west. They are carrying oil, dates, grain and dozens of other products out of Iraq and out of the United Nations- imposed embargo. Soon the sanctions-busters will not even need a road. Two or three times a week flights take off from Amman for Baghdad - again a contravention of the UN resolutions. Similar flights, all supposedly banned under the sanctions, are planned from Egypt and, it is reported, from Moscow.</p> <p>There have already been flights into the newly re-opened Baghdad airport from almost every Gulf state. There have been planes from France, Italy and, indirectly, America and the UK.</p> <p>The marbled lobbies of the five-star hotels in the capital are now packed with businessmen fighting over lucrative contracts. Two months ago 1,450 firms from 30 countries laid out their wares at a trade fair. Ironically, the US company SmithKline Beecham was selling its drugs at an exhibition last week to combat 'depression/anxiety, panic and obsessive compulsive disorder'.</p> <p>At a government level, Iraq has signed new commercial agreements with Turkey, Russia and Libya. There have been secret negotiations with the Syrians, themselves suspected of receiving huge quantities of smuggled oil by rail in recent months. Last week the details of a huge, new trade treaty were being thrashed out with Cairo.</p> <p>Even British companies have been negotiating with the regime. One consortium recently opened an office in Jordan - as close as they can get without breaking the embargo - so they are well-placed when the nation with the second biggest oil reserves in the world officially opens for business once more.</p> <p>'The sanctions are crumbling,' said Professor Humam al-Shamaa, a key government economic consultant. 'They are becoming a joke.' Few, even in Whitehall and Washington, can honestly disagree with him. For four years after the Gulf War the Iraqi people suffered terribly. Many across Iraq, particularly in the south, are suffering still. UN reports suggest hundreds of thousands, particularly the young and old, died as a result of the embargo. Five years ago Saddam agreed to a deal that allowed him to sell oil as long as the earnings, placed in a UN-administered account in New York, were used to buy food and medicine. Much of the cash is soaked up by payments to the UN and war reparations to Kuwait. Red tape, and alleged wilful hindrance, have meant that shortages, particularly of drugs, are common.</p> <p>The result has been serious damage to the country's health. And though the dying children in Iraq's hospitals are cynically exploited by a wealthy regime to impress visiting journalists, in many cases the UN supervisory system has failed. Permission to import equipment used to treat cancers - for fear of use in weapons programmes - is denied. But it is those weapons - and Saddam's unwillingness to reveal their details - that are at the root of the problem. If, the British and American governments say, Saddam allows international inspectors to check he is no longer able to make nuclear, chemical and biological weapons of mass destruction, then the sanctions will be lifted. They have hinted that the 'no fly zones' in the south and north will be ended too. But while the rest of the world is aiding the collapse of sanctions, Saddam has little incentive to make concessions.</p> <p>One Western diplomat told The Observer : 'The British and the Americans have painted themselves into a corner. They can't lift the sanctions, because it will hand Saddam a major victory. But the system is collapsing anyway. Either way they'll end up looking like fools - and stupid, vindictive [fools] at that.'</p> <p>Before Khalil al-Suhail invested in his restaurant he did some market research. 'Soon I knew I'd be fine,' he said. 'I knew I could rely on \"embargo gold\".'</p> <p>The harsh truth is that the sanctions, in addition to inflicting suffering on millions, made many very rich. Uday, Saddam's psychotic eldest son, has run the bulk of the regime's oil-smuggling operation and made his father one of the richest men in the world. Sources estimate the dictator's wealth at more than \u00a33 billion.</p> <p>Through contracts and franchises handed out to associates, a wider circle of loyalists has made a fortune. Thousands of young Iraqi entrepreneurs have taken advantage of the distortions in demand and distribution caused by the sanctions - almost always with a nudge and a wink and a pay-off to the regime. The rationing system maintained under the 'Food for Oil' programme has allowed big farmers to make huge sums selling grain and other commodities. And the huge reconstruction projects - such as the motorways - have made many more rich.</p> <p>Support for Saddam among the majority of Iraqis - despite his well-known brutality - is in no way diminished.</p> <p>The al-Hashemi family are the sort of people Western planners hoped would oppose Saddam. Intellectual, politi cised, educated (and even with vital military connections), they remember 'the good days' before the wars and the sanctions.</p> <p>'We have suffered a lot in the last 20 years,' says Mohammed, now a government servant whose $25 monthly salary, added to the government food rations, just about keeps a decent standard of living for his five-strong family.</p> <p>He is scathing about the 'profiteers' and 'merchants of war' who now comprise Baghdad's elite. But he says - and given that he only agreed to meet in secrecy (his name has been changed) he is probably telling the truth - he is now a supporter of the President. 'As the grip has tightened on our country more and more, we have got closer and closer to our leader. He is now the embodiment of the spirit of our nation and we are proud of him.'</p> <p>Such support is unlikely to erode soon. For a decade Iraqi schoolchildren have learnt about the great victory of Saddam over the vicious, Muslim-hating, neo-colonialist West. In recent months Saddam's prestige has been boosted by his outspoken support for the four-month-old Palestinian uprising.</p> <p>At Friday prayers last week at the 700-year-old shrine of Sheikh Abdul Qadeer al-Gilani in old Baghdad a packed congregation heard a sermon condemning to hell those who stood by and allowed their fellow Muslims to be harmed. It was a sideswipe both at those who ignored the Palestinians and those who have failed to support Iraq. Afterwards the imam, Sheikh Afif, told The Observer that the Iraqi people had showed 'the patience of Job' in their suffering.</p> <p>He recited an Iraqi proverb. 'A journey of a thousand miles starts with just one step,' he said. 'We started directly after the American and British aggression. Now our thousand miles are nearly travelled. Our victory is nearly complete.'</p>",

Baghdad is now a city where $35,000 cars are bought within minutes of being driven into showrooms, where women in leopardskin coats and miniskirts go to the National Theatre to watch the latest avant-garde plays, where you can get a PlayStation2 without waiting, where the caf\u00e9s are full until late and markets open around the clock. Baghdad is also a city that is proud: proud of having survived the sanctions, proud of having survived three bouts of bombing by US and British planes, and proud, above all, of the man whose heavy, jowly features are on a wall in every office and classroom, on a corner on every street, on 20ft-high posters, placards and banners, on book covers, newspapers and magazines. Last Wednesday - the anniversary of the start of the air war in the Gulf - Saddam Hussein, now 63, received a 21-gun salute and addressed the nation on television. He spoke of the great victory won in the Umm al-Marrik (Mother of all Battles) against the 650,000-strong allied forces 10 years ago. The victory, he said, was continuing and growing. The Iraqi people, and the Arab and the Islamic worlds, could expect further greatness in the years to come. Saddam's satisfaction is understandable. Ten years ago he was a pariah. Defeated militarily and diplomatically, his economy was in tatters and his hold on power looked shaky. Now everything is different. The 500-mile-long road from Jordan to Baghdad cuts across one of the bleakest, hottest deserts in the world. Only when you reach the Euphrates, after 10 hours of driving, does green begin to spatter the dirty, blasted monotony of sand and rock. But, though long, it is a surprisingly easy drive. The road from the Jordanian capital of Amman may be crowded, bumpy and narrow, but once across the border, and past a recent statue of a sword-wielding Saddam on a rearing horse flanked by four flaring Scuds, you hurtle along a new six-lane motorway complete with laybys and picnic spots. On the old road that still runs parallel, a stream of trucks and tankers rumbles west. They are carrying oil, dates, grain and dozens of other products out of Iraq and out of the United Nations- imposed embargo. Soon the sanctions-busters will not even need a road. Two or three times a week flights take off from Amman for Baghdad - again a contravention of the UN resolutions. Similar flights, all supposedly banned under the sanctions, are planned from Egypt and, it is reported, from Moscow. There have already been flights into the newly re-opened Baghdad airport from almost every Gulf state. There have been planes from France, Italy and, indirectly, America and the UK. The marbled lobbies of the five-star hotels in the capital are now packed with businessmen fighting over lucrative contracts. Two months ago 1,450 firms from 30 countries laid out their wares at a trade fair. Ironically, the US company SmithKline Beecham was selling its drugs at an exhibition last week to combat 'depression/anxiety, panic and obsessive compulsive disorder'. At a government level, Iraq has signed new commercial agreements with Turkey, Russia and Libya. There have been secret negotiations with the Syrians, themselves suspected of receiving huge quantities of smuggled oil by rail in recent months. Last week the details of a huge, new trade treaty were being thrashed out with Cairo. Even British companies have been negotiating with the regime. One consortium recently opened an office in Jordan - as close as they can get without breaking the embargo - so they are well-placed when the nation with the second biggest oil reserves in the world officially opens for business once more. 'The sanctions are crumbling,' said Professor Humam al-Shamaa, a key government economic consultant. 'They are becoming a joke.' Few, even in Whitehall and Washington, can honestly disagree with him. For four years after the Gulf War the Iraqi people suffered terribly. Many across Iraq, particularly in the south, are suffering still. UN reports suggest hundreds of thousands, particularly the young and old, died as a result of the embargo. Five years ago Saddam agreed to a deal that allowed him to sell oil as long as the earnings, placed in a UN-administered account in New York, were used to buy food and medicine. Much of the cash is soaked up by payments to the UN and war reparations to Kuwait. Red tape, and alleged wilful hindrance, have meant that shortages, particularly of drugs, are common. The result has been serious damage to the country's health. And though the dying children in Iraq's hospitals are cynically exploited by a wealthy regime to impress visiting journalists, in many cases the UN supervisory system has failed. Permission to import equipment used to treat cancers - for fear of use in weapons programmes - is denied. But it is those weapons - and Saddam's unwillingness to reveal their details - that are at the root of the problem. If, the British and American governments say, Saddam allows international inspectors to check he is no longer able to make nuclear, chemical and biological weapons of mass destruction, then the sanctions will be lifted. They have hinted that the 'no fly zones' in the south and north will be ended too. But while the rest of the world is aiding the collapse of sanctions, Saddam has little incentive to make concessions. One Western diplomat told The Observer : 'The British and the Americans have painted themselves into a corner. They can't lift the sanctions, because it will hand Saddam a major victory. But the system is collapsing anyway. Either way they'll end up looking like fools - and stupid, vindictive [fools] at that.' Before Khalil al-Suhail invested in his restaurant he did some market research. 'Soon I knew I'd be fine,' he said. 'I knew I could rely on \"embargo gold\".' The harsh truth is that the sanctions, in addition to inflicting suffering on millions, made many very rich. Uday, Saddam's psychotic eldest son, has run the bulk of the regime's oil-smuggling operation and made his father one of the richest men in the world. Sources estimate the dictator's wealth at more than \u00a33 billion. Through contracts and franchises handed out to associates, a wider circle of loyalists has made a fortune. Thousands of young Iraqi entrepreneurs have taken advantage of the distortions in demand and distribution caused by the sanctions - almost always with a nudge and a wink and a pay-off to the regime. The rationing system maintained under the 'Food for Oil' programme has allowed big farmers to make huge sums selling grain and other commodities. And the huge reconstruction projects - such as the motorways - have made many more rich. Support for Saddam among the majority of Iraqis - despite his well-known brutality - is in no way diminished. The al-Hashemi family are the sort of people Western planners hoped would oppose Saddam. Intellectual, politi cised, educated (and even with vital military connections), they remember 'the good days' before the wars and the sanctions. 'We have suffered a lot in the last 20 years,' says Mohammed, now a government servant whose $25 monthly salary, added to the government food rations, just about keeps a decent standard of living for his five-strong family. He is scathing about the 'profiteers' and 'merchants of war' who now comprise Baghdad's elite. But he says - and given that he only agreed to meet in secrecy (his name has been changed) he is probably telling the truth - he is now a supporter of the President. 'As the grip has tightened on our country more and more, we have got closer and closer to our leader. He is now the embodiment of the spirit of our nation and we are proud of him.' Such support is unlikely to erode soon. For a decade Iraqi schoolchildren have learnt about the great victory of Saddam over the vicious, Muslim-hating, neo-colonialist West. In recent months Saddam's prestige has been boosted by his outspoken support for the four-month-old Palestinian uprising. At Friday prayers last week at the 700-year-old shrine of Sheikh Abdul Qadeer al-Gilani in old Baghdad a packed congregation heard a sermon condemning to hell those who stood by and allowed their fellow Muslims to be harmed. It was a sideswipe both at those who ignored the Palestinians and those who have failed to support Iraq. Afterwards the imam, Sheikh Afif, told The Observer that the Iraqi people had showed 'the patience of Job' in their suffering. He recited an Iraqi proverb. 'A journey of a thousand miles starts with just one step,' he said. 'We started directly after the American and British aggression. Now our thousand miles are nearly travelled. Our victory is nearly complete.'",

The Conservative Party dropped new legislation from its last Queen's Speech in 1996, fearing embarrassment over the inevitable - and proper - need to recognise unmarried couples as adopters.</p> <p>New Labour has been just as timid. What the current Parliament has passed, however, is the Adoption (International Aspects) Act 1999. This will provide protection for children adopted from overseas. It will also bring in sanctions for those who ignore its provisions.

      "bodyText": "Tiny children touch all too exposed nerves in many of us. So it is unsurprising that the 'tragedy of internet adoption' has become an opportunity for political grandstanding. However, no political party can claim the moral high ground in the recent history of adoption law. The Conservative Party dropped new legislation from its last Queen's Speech in 1996, fearing embarrassment over the inevitable - and proper - need to recognise unmarried couples as adopters. New Labour has been just as timid. What the current Parliament has passed, however, is the Adoption (International Aspects) Act 1999. This will provide protection for children adopted from overseas. It will also bring in sanctions for those who ignore its provisions. But the Bill has still not been enacted. Whether the cause of the Government's delay has been sloth, incompetence or political cowardice, it should move swiftly now. But as Mary Riddell points out in What am I bid for this baby?, enactment will still not encompass adoption from America. The special 'designation' which provides this loophole should be abolished immediately. Then all UK residents bringing children from abroad would have to pass domestic adoption tests. Babies Belinda and Kimberley would thus have been offered immediate protection upon their arrival in Britain last week. With infertility now affecting 10 per cent of couples and a tiny number of children available for adoption in Britain, we should have no prejudice against adopting from abroad.

'It's going to be disastrous for our economy.' </p> <p>Two-thirds of Californians polled by the Los Angeles Times say they expect a recession this year, and some Wall Street analysts have gone so far as to predict bank failures, chaos in the bond markets and a drying up of business lending, as well as job cuts. </p> <p>So who is to blame? Most point to what they say is a greedy group of power generators cashing in on the state's now discredited deregulation scheme - and the politicians who passed the laws. The scheme forced utility companies to buy in electricity at soaring market rates but pre vents them from passing those costs on to consumers. Now the companies are just a filament away from bankruptcy - and no one wants to sell them any more electricity for fear they cannot pay their bills. </p> <p>There is also the weather - a hot summer and a significantly colder winter - and drier than usual conditions in the Pacific North-West, limiting supplies of hydroelectric power to the US's most populous state. </p> <p>Then there is the powerful environmentalist lobby, now taking heat for an array of green-friendly regulations, which have made building new power plants in California next to impossible. And, of course, consumers, who do not see why they should ever have to turn off a light when they leave a room. </p> <p>And now there is a fresh target for the wrath of the newly powerless: the internet. Silicon Valley is accused of overloading California's power infrastructure. </p> <p>A recent study suggests the internet now accounts for 8 per cent of national electricity consumption - and could come to consume between 30 and 50 per cent of it in 20 years . This statistic has been seized on by President George W. Bush as he seeks to justify an energy policy that will allow oil drilling and coal mining in the pristine wilderness of Alaska - but the figures are spurious, say some analysts. </p> <p>The internet, after all, was supposed to conserve energy by making businesses run more efficiently - and it was widely believed that computers and wireless devices use much less energy than refrigerators or washing machines. </p> <p>Not so, say the two free-market conservative analysts powering the blame-the-internet movement. Mark Mills and Peter Huber of the 'Digital Power Report' and the coal industry-funded Greening Earth Society, insist a Palm Pilot uses as much energy as a refrigerator - citing invisible 'back-end' network and telecommunications infrastructure such as routers, servers and digital transmission systems for the surge in electricity use. Power consumption in Silicon Valley, they say, has been growing at three times the rate of the rest of the California's - with Oracle, Intel, Sun Microsystems and the like using the same mega-wattage as 'a steel mill'. </p> <p>But others say that's simply 'ridiculous'. Steven Taub, an analyst with Cambridge Energy Research Associates says: 'It doesn't take a lot of steel mills shutting down to offset increased demand from computers. You just can't blame my Palm Pilot for this crisis - it runs on two triple-A batteries! But the tech economy behind those devices has led to an unprecedented economic boom - and that means bigger houses, more appliances, more offices - and more demand for electricity.' </p> <p>Jonathan Koomey, a scientist and the group leader of the End-Use Forecasting Group at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratories in Berkeley, says the blackouts are not related to any such rapid increase in demand. He cites statistics from the California Energy Commission showing only a 2 per cent growth rate in electricity demand in the late 1990s at the height of the e-boom, compared with a growth rate of 3.3 per cent in the late 1980s. </p> <p>'The people who want to build power plants would like everyone to think that there is huge growth in demand so we can reduce environmental regulations,' says Koomey. 'I think we have to build power plants, yes, but I also think people are trying to create a sense of urgency to make it easier for them to argue for their interests.' </p> <p>Intel chief executive Craig Barrett is among a growing group of tech billionaires now pushing for the construction of new power plants as they try to avoid 'blue screen death' - the loss of millions of dollars whenever power fluctuates, even for a fraction of a second, because the chips being manufactured can be ruined. Intel, which has been operating under what Barrett calls 'mood lighting' between 4pm and 7pm when the company turns half its lights off voluntarily to conserve electricity, has already threatened to move some operations to Oregon, Arizona, New Mexico and even Israel and Ireland - unless, that is, new power plants get built, and fast. </p> <p>Other giants such as Sun Microsystems, MCI WorldCom and website host Verio have resorted to diesel generators to keep their businesses humming - a trend now so pervasive that environmental regulators fear that diesel exhaust could soon add significantly to pollution. </p> <p>Last Thursday, California lawmakers approved a $400 million plan to turn the lights back on. The bail-out will allow the state to buy power on the open market and provide it to the near-bankrupt utilities - Pacific Gas &amp; Electric and Southern California Edison - at low cost. But the money won't go far.

It is also, perhaps, too late. Assorted research shows that babies shuffled from one carer to the next may be traumatised and damaged for life.</p> <p>Though the going rate for Kimberley and Belinda was set at the knockdown price of \u00a38,200, the real cost of the deal is unquantifiable and, as yet, unpaid. Meanwhile, a spider's web of interests ensnares the girls. The Allens of California want them back. So do the final purchasers, the Kilshaws of North Wales. For now, social services have gained possession in the pass-the-parcel game of human life, and the long, messy legal battle begins.</p> <p>Alan and Judith Kilshaw, who will take their claim to the High Court this week, may be perfect parents. It could transpire that they run a spotless home. It is possible that there were sound reasons for allegedly calling in ghostbusters to investigate paranormal phenomena chez Kilshaw. However, as Mrs Kilshaw said, with unusual prescience, she is now 'the most hated figure in Britain'.</p> <p>But the real villains are the internet agencies, e-tailing's slave traders, supplying children to order. The market rate for Chinese baby girls is \u00a310,800, whereas a healthy, white, American boy will set you back twice as much. It is no good pretending, as some have, that there is nothing much amiss with this extension of the retail business.

      "bodyText": "Can there be a happy ending for the internet twins? As the authorities, from Arkansas to Flintshire, dissect their case, it is too early to speak of good outcomes. It is also, perhaps, too late. Assorted research shows that babies shuffled from one carer to the next may be traumatised and damaged for life. Though the going rate for Kimberley and Belinda was set at the knockdown price of \u00a38,200, the real cost of the deal is unquantifiable and, as yet, unpaid. Meanwhile, a spider's web of interests ensnares the girls. The Allens of California want them back. So do the final purchasers, the Kilshaws of North Wales. For now, social services have gained possession in the pass-the-parcel game of human life, and the long, messy legal battle begins. Alan and Judith Kilshaw, who will take their claim to the High Court this week, may be perfect parents. It could transpire that they run a spotless home. It is possible that there were sound reasons for allegedly calling in ghostbusters to investigate paranormal phenomena chez Kilshaw. However, as Mrs Kilshaw said, with unusual prescience, she is now 'the most hated figure in Britain'. But the real villains are the internet agencies, e-tailing's slave traders, supplying children to order. The market rate for Chinese baby girls is \u00a310,800, whereas a healthy, white, American boy will set you back twice as much. It is no good pretending, as some have, that there is nothing much amiss with this extension of the retail business.

One of those half-dozen is Henri-Georges Clouzot's The Wages of Fear, from which it borrows the idea of transporting volatile nitroglycerin over difficult terrain, repeating a famous shot from that picture to show this is a knowing homage. </p> <p>Shot mostly in New Zealand, it centres on a dangerous ascent of K2, the second highest peak in the Himalayas, planned by a rich Texas businessman (Bill Paxton) to coincide with the inauguration of a new route for his airline. Inevitably things go wrong and he's buried in a deep crevasse at 26,000 feet with an American woman climber, Annie (Robin Tunney), and the expedition's leader. The rescue must be carried out in 27 hours, and the rescue team is composed of people each with a private agenda, among them Annie's brother, Peter (Chris O'Donnell), who has to assuage the guilt brought about by the death of their mountaineering father; a mystic mountaineer (Scott Glenn), who looks like Geronimo and is searching for revenge and his missing wife's body; and a pair of happy-go-lucky Australian hippies. The nitroglycerin is needed to blow open the crevasse and to add yet another hazard to flaking rock, blinding snow, avalanches and so on. </p> <p>Campbell sustains the tension pretty well and the settings are spectacular. More interesting than the characters, however, are two aspects of the dramatic background. The first is an isolated army post on a mountain peak from which ill-equipped Pakistani soldiers fire an artillery barrage every afternoon in the direction of India as an absurd daily ritual.

Sadly, he's lost his nerve and followed it with the conventional, sentimental <strong> Bounce</strong>. The Roos has come home to chicken. Ben Affleck plays a womanising advertising agent who, partly in order to spend the night with an available blonde, gives his plane ticket in the snowbound Chicago airport to a married man, eager to get home to Los Angeles for Christmas. The plane crashes with no survivors. Affleck takes to the bottle, starts to despise his work (his firm represents the airline involved), then arranges a chance meeting with the man's widow (Gwyneth Paltrow) and her young sons. </p> <p>There's a current Hollywood belief (as shown in Blown Away, Random Hearts, Cast Away, Unbreakable) that there's nothing like being in, or just missing, a horrendous accident to make you appreciate the real things in life. But Bounce is factitious stuff. Unlike Bernard MacLaverty's Cal or Graham Greene's The Tenth Man, whose anti-heroes were responsible for the deaths of the women they come to love, the Affleck character has nothing really to hide. </p> <p>Darren Aronofsky's follow-up to his impressive debut Pi, <strong> Requiem For a Dream</strong>, is a gruelling picture tracing four sad people in run-down Coney Island as they descend into a hell of drug addiction. A Jewish widow (Ellen Burstyn), becomes addicted to slimming pills she takes to appear on a TV show; her layabout son (Jared Leto) and his partner in petty crime (Marlon Wayans) plan to become big-time dealers, and the son's girlfriend, a middle-class drop-out, wants to open a dress shop. Their dreams drive them to drugs, the drugs destroy the dreams. </p> <p>Co-adapted by Hubert Selby Jr, author of Last Exit to Brooklyn, from his own novel, Requiem For a Dream is a superbly acted tale of hopelessness and despair that runs through three chapters - Summer, Fall, Winter. Their Spring never comes. The final cross-cutting between the mother undergoing ECT at a New York psychiatric hospital, the son having his gangrenous arm sawn off in a Florida prison and the girlfriend submitting to painful anal sex at a Long Island orgy is hard to watch and impossible to recommend. </p> <p>Roberto Faenza's Anglo-Italian <strong> The Lost Lover</strong> is a well-meaning, melodramatic story of a British couple, garage owner (Ciaran Hinds) and his historian wife (Juliet Aubrey), still grieving after 13 years in Israel for their three-year-old son killed in a London street accident. A neurotic young Israeli lad (Stuart Bunce) stumbles into their lives and has some curious therapeutic effect on the wife, before suddenly disappearing. The jerky narration and implausible events are accompanied by clunky dialogue that only Hands manages to deliver with conviction.

Yehoshua. </p> <p><strong> Beautiful Creatures</strong>, the long-awaited first film of DNA, the company created by Duncan Kenworthy (producer of Notting Hil ) and Andrew Macdonald (Shallow Grave, Trainspotting), is a serious disappointment. This extremely violent black comedy stars Rachel Weisz and Susan Lynch as a pair of Glasgow-based girls in abusive relationships, whose paths cross by chance when one of them accidentally kills the other's brutal boyfriend. They get involved in a murky kidnapping scam, are pursued by a bent copper (Alex Norton) and the dead man's remorseless brother (Maurice Roeves), and more bloody deaths ensue.

It doesn't belong in the same cemetery as Shallow Grave.",

Chipperfield's design elegantly deals with all this on his own terms. It does have a pitched roof, but it is transformed with beautiful thick slabs of solid slate. There is a large shuttered opening at the front but it's not a garage door. It's the interior, connected to the original Chipperfield extension, which is most memorable.

It's the exact opposite of the child's idea of the house. Not only is there no pointed roof, and no chimney; most shockingly there aren't even any windows visible. The regular pattern of glass and brick set up by the rest of the street is abruptly halted by a mysterious brooding black obelisk. Its smooth shiny skin is actually specially treated plywood; but you would never guess if you hadn't been told. It could equally well be be steel, or lead, an ambiguity that increases its exotic quality. Inside the house, the cramped realities of Whitechapel street life slip away.

Any survey that includes works by Rubens, Van Dyck and Annibale Carracci probably deserves to brag about genius, hardly too strong a word in the context of Rome circa 1600. This one also boasts 40 other artists and more than 150 paintings usually screwed above Italian altars or shielded by laser alarms in the Vatican, Prado or Met. </p> <p>Well may the RA congratulate itself on having coaxed such art to London on our sole behalf - this show won't be going anywhere else. But the crowning glory of the entire event isn't even mentioned, never mind brandished in that triumphant title, namely the presence, from first to last, of Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio. </p> <p>From his arrival in 1592 to his sudden departure in 1606 after killing a man in a brawl, Caravaggio was the defining genius of Rome. You see that in room after room of this show, as the lesser paintings seem to turn towards his art as the source of all light and heat. Nor is this just a modern hindsight, abetted by tales of his fiery life; Rome had him pegged as a genius even before 1600. The Church relied on Caravaggio to reinforce its latest theology; collectors resorted to monstrous tactics to acquire his work; and almost every contemporary painter in the Eternal City took something from his art. </p> <p>The last major Caravaggio show was almost 20 years ago, and unless you were lucky enough to be in New York at the time, you probably didn't see it. Pilgrimage is practically the only way to get a view of his far-flung art - and for that you'd have to go to Rome, Naples, Malta, St Petersburg and Fort Worth at the least. Even that would be a partial view, since Caravaggios are still coming and going - stolen, used as collateral in drug deals or turning up, buried in grime, in some Jesuit refectory in Dublin. </p> <p>That particular painting, The Taking of Christ (1602), is one of the wonders of the RA show. There are all the Caravaggian attributes, aped by others in weak pastiche: the strongly raking light, the dark cavern in which the figures gesture and twist, the sense of motion so vividly proleptic it seems about to burst right out of the canvas. Christ alone is still, hands calmly clasped in the brutal onslaught, as Judas and a rush of soldiers in black steel close in as if for the kill. Violent, crowded and tight, the event is caught in a flash-bulb glare - and there, at the far right, is Caravaggio himself, holding up the lantern that sheds that light. </p> <p>Some people see mutiny in this self-portrait, a sort of take-me-as-I-am retort to a patron who may have been trying to control the image. Certainly, almost half of Caravaggio's paintings were too independent for the Church, although recent attempts to make an atheist of him wither with one glimpse of the stark piety that fires his art. Even at 100 yards, the effect is electrifying - witness St John the Baptist, hung at the far end of the long central corridor at the Academy. </p> <p>This distant figure, naked in the wilderness, seems to have been struck by lightning. Although the eyes are downcast in sepulchral shadow, the sense of concentrated thought, of imminent action, is unimaginably powerful. Painted by Caravaggio, St John becomes again what he was in life - literally a beacon shining out of the darkness. </p> <p>It's easy to see why everyone wants such strength on their side, why atheists seek to recruit Caravaggio, why artists have him as a proto-romantic or modernist, why socialists co-opt him as the painter of the common people, with their dirty toenails and sunburnt forearms. </p> <p>It is even easier when you consider that his life is mainly told in other people's words. There are the police records of him wounding a waiter in a spat about an artichoke; murdering an enemy and then taking flight to Naples. There are the documents of his enrolment and subsequent defrocking as a Knight of Malta, and the newspaper accounts of his sudden death at 39 in 1610. Letters describe him as paranoid, irascible and preternaturally gifted. Only one suggests he might have been gay. </p> <p>Anyone hoping for some clarification of this live-fast-die-young legend ought to go straight to the Royal Academy. For one thing, the Rome this show proposes is a violent, dark and unjust city, stalked by cutthroats, mercenaries and aristocratic thugs. Artists were not spared; their paintings give the picture. </p> <p>Here is Artemesia Gentileschi's vengeance on the fellow artist who raped her and escaped sentence - he's the bleeding head in her mighty Judith Beheading Holofernes. Here is Cesari's grateful portrait of the lawyer who helped him when a cardinal had the painter falsely imprisoned in order to filch his Caravaggios. Look at Annibale Carracci's desperate self-portrait, no bigger than a playing card, and you see his melancholy death prefigured. Annibale may have painted some of the greatest of all frescoes for the Farnese Palace, but his patron threw him little more than derisory cash. </p> <p>When Caravaggio arrived in Rome, late mannerism was still in its final flounce. But private collections were increasingly prestigious and originality was valued: enter Caravaggio with the first still lifes. The painting that launches this exhibition is also the first known Caravaggio - a boy with those characteristic Callas eyebrows peeling what looks like a wooden lime. If it is by Caravaggio, it only shows how swiftly he moved from here to the Boy With Basket of Fruit in a matter of months. </p> <p>This is one of art's greatest invitations - how to choose between the youth, with his yearning mouth, enticing gaze and sleep-ruffled curls, or the ripe cornucopia he displays against his off-the-shoulder drapes? Caravaggio's contemporaries plumped for the fruit; you see that basket over and again, even arriving as if by FedEx to refresh the Holy Family on their flight to Egypt. But everything Caravaggio did was copied - the comic cardsharps, the fortune-tellers, the lute players and singers - as successive galleries of lacklustre imitations unfortunately show. </p> <p>Rubens can take care of himself, along with Van Dyck, two artists who came south and prospered in Rome. But I'm not sure that Carracci is going to get the revival he merits (even Caravaggio admired him) given his low-level presence here.

Sanjeev Bhaskar and the rest of the crew working on Position Impossible: In Search of the Kama Sutra arrived excitedly at the great man's door, only to receive some bad news. Forgetting that visitors were expected, the eminent astrologer had, that very morning, taken an 11-day vow of silence. </p> <p>'I sat there for 10 minutes thinking, \"I don't know what I'm doing here\",' says Sanjeev (best known as 'Mr Cheque Please' and 'Mr Everything Comes from India' in the BBC's Goodness Gracious Me ), when we meet at his London club, Teatro. 'I thought, it's all going to be like this. Mental.' In the end, a go-between was found to decode the astrologer's scribbles, and the encounter, which could have been a disaster, was turned into something quite different: a surreal encounter that says a great deal about India, and Sanjeev's fond if bewildered feelings towards it. </p> <p>It was his idea to make a documentary about the Kama Sutra. It's an idiosyncratic attempt to get past the myth of the book, beyond the smutty associations and the giggles, and explore its relevance: both to its original audience, and a modern one. After all, only a fifth of the book is concerned with bedroom gymnastics. Written in the fourth century by the Hindu sage Vatsyayana, it offers suggestions on a wide variety of social accomplishments: how to sing, fight, make lemonade, read the secrets of the night sky, and decorate your bedroom. 'In the fourth century, Europeans were living in mud huts and had just discovered brass,' says Sanjeev, 36. 'Whereas the Indians had this hugely complex society and were writing books about politics and economics and religion. So the Kama Sutra was written in that context - not as a dirty book, but as a book that tried to explain what a good citizen should do within or when forming a relationship.' </p> <p>Seeking information from a range of commentators, some of whom shed more light on the text than others, Sanjeev is careful not to use them for cheap gags. The tantric sexpert, for instance, digs his own grave, leaps in, and lies there, quivering expectantly. Sanjeev says, half-regretfully, that he lacks Louis Theroux's courage, but he still manages to coax forth some Theroux-like revelations and, in the process, lets slip just as much about himself. </p> <p>Over a latte, as on telly, he seems to have very little side: he is funny, relaxed, almost disconcertingly sincere. </p> <p>Discussing the Kama Sutra 's attitude to marriage, he mentions that his parents had a go at matchmaking him, introducing him to a couple of nice girls, neither of whom seemed 'quite right'. He believes arranged marriage can work, but is pleased his parents have now accepted it's not for him. 'If they do talk about settling down or kids, I don't go, \"Mum!\" I tend to say I'm not averse to the idea, I'd quite like to settle down, I'm just not in any rush about it.' </p> <p>The child of parents who came to Ealing from the Punjab in the Fifties (his dad was a supervisor at the Nestl\u00e9 factory in Hayes; his mother was an accountant) he has a strange lifelong association with the Kama Sutra, though he only read it recently. 'People always assumed that being Indian, I'd know all about it, along with tea and curry and Bollywood movies. I could get away with the other ones - 'It's coriander, you know' - but with the Kama Sutra, it was really tricky. So the easiest thing was to lie. Especially in the uni bar. If they asked how many positions were in it, I'd say, three. And if they asked me when it was written, I'd say 1932.' These fibs didn't transform his love life, though, 'because after that you'd have to prove it'. </p> <p>After the University of Hertfordshire, he went to work as a marketing manager at IBM, 'and because of the marketing stuff, my bluffing became better, so I could say with authority that it was written in 1847 and there were 237 positions.' Later, he tried his hand at arts marketing, which didn't really work out, and then he had 18 months on the dole. At this point, he went back to an idea that had attracted him as a child, and joined a theatre workshop. He was spotted by two comedy writers scouting for a new radio comedy, and found himself in the Goodness Gracious Me line-up. After GGM became a smash hit and transferred to television, he picked up the Kama Sutra for the first time, wondering if it would make for a good documentary, and found it full of good sense and comic potential. 'It wasn't a manual for sexual superstardom. It's a book of choices. And it was actually quite funny, too.' </p> <p> Position Impossible is not a conventional documentary. It combines travelogue, social history and standup in equal measure. In his quest to understand the book's relevance to both the fourth-century Indian court and twenty-first-century relationships, Sanjeev finds himself at Richard Burton's grave, in a Delhi sex clinic, and being lapdanced at Stringfellow's. In between, he's seen on stage, musing in front of an audience. As a technique, it's a little distracting: quite often, the expression on his face while on location says much more than his monologue does. </p> <p>Sanjeev visited the lapdancing club in an attempt to compare Western and Eastern attitudes to women. He had just weathered a sort of stag night in Lucknow, in which a young woman in a green sari danced for a roomful of giggly, slightly bashful men, force-fed him a samosa, and relieved all present of most of their cash. At Stringfellow's, an approximate Western parallel, Sanjeev is completely freaked out. You can see it from his expression: a small, terrified smile that shrinks as the bosoms and buttocks come in for the kill. </p> <p>In an attempt to get through the experience, he doggedly maintains eye contact with the lapdancer and makes a few lame conversational forays. 'Your hair is in lovely condition,' he says, and: 'Did you watch much of Euro 2000?' It wasn't exactly a meeting of minds, but it made him feel less uncomfortable. 'To be drawn in you have to want to investigate further, but what is left to investigate if someone has taken their clothes off and wiggled in front of you for a tenner? With the dancer in Lucknow, you couldn't help thinking, \"When you gave me attention, did you mean it more than when you gave the other person attention?\" It was silly, but harmless, and fun, whereas there was so much frustrated negative tension in the lapdancing club. If you go to clubs like that, you can only see women sexually. The Kama Sutra isn't perfect by any means - it's the woman who has to bend herself into all sorts of sexual positions while the man just has to twirl his moustache. But there is still a degree of respect, of equality.' </p> <p>Sanjeev's foray into TV presenting, like his comedy career, wasn't part of a long-term plan. Neither were movies, but now there's a role in the next Merchant Ivory, The Mystic Masseur, based on V.S. Naipaul's novel and about to film in Trinidad, and a three-picture deal with Miramax. 'It's weird, and probably undeserved in my case, but if you just sit there, things do come to you.

The gambling magnate Stuart Wheeler gave the Tories \u00a35million to help them win the next election, and the publisher Paul Hamlyn pledged \u00a317m to redevelop London's South Bank. Wheeler, a betting man, is taking a suicidal risk; Hamlyn, more cannily, has invested in a certainty. In return for his donation, the Royal Festival Hall will be renamed in his honour. </p> <p>Corporations long ago co-opted our great arts institutions: at present the RSC is Allied Domecq's pet charity and AT&amp;T (not content with owning the air we breathe and use for communicating with each other) proprietorially flies its flag above the Almeida. More recently, donors have cast off their corporate camouflage. </p> <p>Philanthropists no longer perform good works dis creetly. Money now is handed over in return for personal publicity. In the British Museum's new Great Court, those whose cheques contained enough zeroes have their names carved into the marble wall above that staircase wrapped around the outside of the old Reading Room - the Sainsburys, the Clores, Vivien Duffield, Joseph Hotung. As far as I know, none of these people has ever written a book; their presence here, though chiselled not scribbled, is as impertinent as graffiti. </p> <p>John Jerwood's foundation, disposing of the proceeds of dealing in cultured pearls, saved the Royal Court redevelopment scheme with a gift of \u00a33m. In recompense, the foundation insisted on rechristening the building the Jerwood Royal Court. Chris Smith balked at permitting a publicly funded institution to be privatised; as a compromise, Jerwood was restricted to naming the auditoria, so the disputed building is now called the Jerwood Theatres at the Royal Court Theatre. Either way, Jerwood succeeded in bumptiously inserting his name above the title. </p> <p>The stock-market entrepreneur Alberto Vilar, frittering away his Nasdaq spoils, has turned international opera into a personal fiefdom. The Royal Opera House compliantly named the Floral Hall after him, and the Metropolitan Opera in New York has done the same with its Grand Tier. This season, in the programme for the Met's new Fidelio, Vilar's name was emblazoned in a typeface larger than those of the conductor, director or any of the singers. </p> <p>To amuse himself during the summer, Vilar has appropriated the Salzburg Festival. I hope they told him, after cashing his cheque, where Salzburg was: at a press conference there a few years ago, I heard him refer to it as the sacred site of 'the greatest arts festival in Germany'. A portrait of Vilar, smirking oleaginously as he sits enthroned in a gilded fauteuil, is inserted into the programme for every Salzburg performance. Because the portrait is an insert, it's easily discarded: by the end of the evening, innumerable images of the Cuban Mr Moneybags are besmirched by horse shit in the city's gutters. </p> <p>Paul Hamlyn, having given the Labour Party \u00a32m, already possesses a life peerage, but he is apparently in poor health, and must be speculating about the irrelevance of honours which expire when your life does. Paying to have a building renamed after you is like building a monument to yourself, as Ozymandias deludedly did. It is the rich man's way of buying immortality. </p> <p>Let us by all means take Hamlyn's money, secure in the knowledge that what he thinks he's getting in exchange is not for sale. Next door to the RFH is a concrete acropolis of buildings and auditoria named after men who thought that they would live on in monoliths: the Hayward Gallery, the Purcell Room and the Lyttleton, Olivier and Cottesloe Theatres. </p> <p>But posterity has already done some shrewd sorting out, selecting two of these names for commemoration and consigning the rest to oblivion. No one attending a concert or a play on the South Bank could tell you anything about Hayward, Lyttleton or Cottesloe, because they were merely bureaucrats - or suits with fat wallets in their breast pockets. </p> <p>None of us will ever forget who Purcell and Olivier were, because they were great artists - and we don't need buildings to remind us of their existence.</p>",

In the British Museum's new Great Court, those whose cheques contained enough zeroes have their names carved into the marble wall above that staircase wrapped around the outside of the old Reading Room - the Sainsburys, the Clores, Vivien Duffield, Joseph Hotung. As far as I know, none of these people has ever written a book; their presence here, though chiselled not scribbled, is as impertinent as graffiti. John Jerwood's foundation, disposing of the proceeds of dealing in cultured pearls, saved the Royal Court redevelopment scheme with a gift of \u00a33m. In recompense, the foundation insisted on rechristening the building the Jerwood Royal Court. Chris Smith balked at permitting a publicly funded institution to be privatised; as a compromise, Jerwood was restricted to naming the auditoria, so the disputed building is now called the Jerwood Theatres at the Royal Court Theatre. Either way, Jerwood succeeded in bumptiously inserting his name above the title. The stock-market entrepreneur Alberto Vilar, frittering away his Nasdaq spoils, has turned international opera into a personal fiefdom. The Royal Opera House compliantly named the Floral Hall after him, and the Metropolitan Opera in New York has done the same with its Grand Tier. This season, in the programme for the Met's new Fidelio, Vilar's name was emblazoned in a typeface larger than those of the conductor, director or any of the singers. To amuse himself during the summer, Vilar has appropriated the Salzburg Festival. I hope they told him, after cashing his cheque, where Salzburg was: at a press conference there a few years ago, I heard him refer to it as the sacred site of 'the greatest arts festival in Germany'. A portrait of Vilar, smirking oleaginously as he sits enthroned in a gilded fauteuil, is inserted into the programme for every Salzburg performance. Because the portrait is an insert, it's easily discarded: by the end of the evening, innumerable images of the Cuban Mr Moneybags are besmirched by horse shit in the city's gutters. Paul Hamlyn, having given the Labour Party \u00a32m, already possesses a life peerage, but he is apparently in poor health, and must be speculating about the irrelevance of honours which expire when your life does. Paying to have a building renamed after you is like building a monument to yourself, as Ozymandias deludedly did. It is the rich man's way of buying immortality. Let us by all means take Hamlyn's money, secure in the knowledge that what he thinks he's getting in exchange is not for sale. Next door to the RFH is a concrete acropolis of buildings and auditoria named after men who thought that they would live on in monoliths: the Hayward Gallery, the Purcell Room and the Lyttleton, Olivier and Cottesloe Theatres. But posterity has already done some shrewd sorting out, selecting two of these names for commemoration and consigning the rest to oblivion. No one attending a concert or a play on the South Bank could tell you anything about Hayward, Lyttleton or Cottesloe, because they were merely bureaucrats - or suits with fat wallets in their breast pockets. None of us will ever forget who Purcell and Olivier were, because they were great artists - and we don't need buildings to remind us of their existence.",

      "body": "<p>Why? people asking me incredulously. Why does a 30-year-old pop writer suddenly want to decamp to rural France? That's what they said to start with. When they learnt that I barely speak French, and my wife and I had chosen the area we wanted to live before we'd even been there, they tended to conclude that I must be mad.</p> <p>Now, having moved here a week ago, I wonder if they were right. I'm in my new office, on the first floor of a large stone house, surrounded by unopened cardboard boxes, staring out of the window. In the garden, there are piles of logs and bare fruit trees; beyond it, fields of maize stumps and grass, hills covered by forest; and looming behind them, white on the horizon, are the Pyrenees. It's 20 minutes' walk to the nearest village (population 364), which has a school but no shop. Our closest neighbours are half a mile away. The only sound is the hum of my computer and, if I open the window, the twittering of birds. It's all beautiful but a little bit scary.</p> <p>Six months ago, I was in Ibiza watching Kylie Minogue; now I'm living in a place where mobile phones don't work and most radio signals are just a blizzard of interference.</p> <p>There have been times when I've wondered what on earth drove me to uproot my young family from the comfort and security of our home, job and friends in southern England and bring them to this remote place. My lowest moment so far was three nights ago, when my eldest son woke me up at 4.30am and I couldn't get back to sleep. I lay next to him in bed, in shuttered blackness, worrying about money and woodworm, insulation and isolation, septic tanks and verb-endings.</p> <p>Another time, frustrated and exhausted by trying to feed the kids, get hold of an electrician and find the box containing our wellies among the 200 others littering the house, I did actually yell: 'Right, that's it! We're putting the house on the market and moving back to England!' But then the idea seemed so absurd that we started laughing.</p> <p>My great escape began last year with those familiar pangs we all feel when we come back from a holiday - in the mountains or the countryside or by the sea - and get the Tube from Heathrow in the drizzle. The pangs didn't fade as they usually do but intensified with every walk to school in our Hertfordshire village, having to stoop down next to my son's face so I could hear what he was saying above the noise of traffic on the high street. We'd moved there five years earlier from east London, to 'get away from it'. But 'it' had followed us, and was now busy building an apartment block 30 yards from our front door.</p> <p>Everything happened extremely fast, which helped prevent us losing our nerve and staying put. Last May, my wife and I spent two weeks travelling around Provence and Languedoc, peering hopefully into dozens of estate agents' windows. It was lovely, but almost as expensive as London. Then we read about a region called the Gers, in south-west France, where prices were lower and tourists fewer. We looked at the map and thought: that's where we'll live. After weeks spent sorting through property on the internet, we went over in October and saw five houses that we loved. The last of these was in a region south of the Gers, closer to the Spanish border, where prices were even lower and tourists even fewer. Thirty-six hours after selling our old house, we bought the new one.</p> <p>If there was a kind of madness in the fervour with which we pursued this dream, there were also lots of sensible reasons for doing it now: my wife is French, my three children are still young enough to learn the language effortlessly, most of my family lives abroad (my parents in southern Spain, my brother and his family in Madrid), and the massive rise in house prices in south-east England over the past few years meant we could sell our Edwardian semi in Hertfordshire for twice what we paid for it and buy somewhere twice as big, set in five acres of land, for half that price. Now we have no mortgage, which is useful as my monthly income is currently less than I used to spend on the mortgage alone.</p> <p>I had other reasons for escaping - not so easy to explain to financial advisers and social scientists. Turning 30 was part of it; the realisation that I was probably a third of the way through my life; the sense that I was playing things too safe. I had what in many ways was my dream job - writing about music for a national newspaper. Yet somewhere, swirling around my subconscious, was the dim fear of sleepwalking into my forties, numbed by comfort and routine. The times in my life I felt most alive, I realised, were when I was faced with a big new change or challenge - leaving home, falling in love, looking for a job, having children. According to an astrologer friend, this was my Saturn's return - the stars were influencing me to change my way of life. And before you start laughing, I should point out that I have an email from this friend, sent last May, predicting every major event of the last six months with startling accuracy.</p> <p>Besides, however enjoyable my job, I felt that, to quote Philip Larkin, 'the toad Work' was squatting on too large a portion of my life. Contemporary sociological phenomena with names like 'the play ethic' and 'downshifting' are, essentially, just determined attempts to spend less time immobile under striplights, breathing recycled air, concentrating on something that will cease to be truly important the moment you have finished doing it. How you spend the time you save is up to you, but I realised I wanted to spend it making my kids laugh, chopping wood, writing books, digging up vegetables, skiing, feeding chickens, playing tennis, cooking over an open fire, or, just occasionally, sitting in the sun, drinking wine and gazing at the Pyrenees.</p> <p>Other parents, not least my own, tend to look at me anxiously when I tell them this, imagining my three boys starving to death for the sake of my stress levels. I certainly have no illusions about poverty - it's a grind and no fun at all. But despite one of my friends predicting merrily that I would end up 'rotting in peasant oblivion', I can't really see us suffering hypothermia or malnutrition. We will have two fireplaces, a vegetable garden, dozens of fruit trees and freshly laid eggs. It will be fine. That's what I told myself, and other people, over and over again as they questioned the wisdom of the move last autumn. It'll be fine, I said breezily, feeling it, meaning it. I was relentlessly optimistic. We'll just have to make a few small sacrifices, I said. I'll give up parties and Sky TV. My wife will wear wellies instead of kitten mules. The kids will miss out on micro-scooters and Versace jeans and their Pok\u00e9mon collections will be embarrassingly small. I think the scars will heal, somehow.</p> <p>Then, the day in October that I learnt our house sale had finally gone through, another emotion hit me. I caught sight of my face in a mirror and noticed my expression: I looked frightened. Oh God, I thought, what have I done? The panic attack lasted just one evening. I sat on the rug in front of the fire in our living-room and stared into the flames, imagining a series of worst-case scenarios. What if the villagers hate us? What if we're snowbound and the boiler packs up? It was raining outside and there was no alcohol in the house to dull the fear. My wife watched me curiously. 'It'll be fine,' she said, with just a trace of irony. By the next morning, miraculously, it was.</p> <p>I must confess that I rather enjoyed the bleak horrors of our last November in England - the floods, the rail delays, the circulating flu viruses. By this point, most people had stopped questioning my sanity and were asking slightly enviously about the place I was going to: a blessed little corner of south-west France made up of gently rolling hills, fields of corn and sunflowers, winding roads empty of cars and pretty little towns and villages, where, like the nostalgic myth of pre-war England, people don't bother locking their doors and always have time to talk to you. It's like an unspoilt Tuscany or Provence, and I'd better shut up now or I'll be responsible for spoiling it.</p> <p>But nothing is as perfect or as easy as it seems in your dreams. However adaptable kids are, they still scream when you leave them in a school full of people speaking a language they barely understand. However relieved I feel to be free of traffic and train delays, I still have huge lists of 'things to do' pinned to the wall above my desk.</p> <p>Even down here it still rains. Looking out of my office window, I see the clouds overhead are dark and thick but the ones on the horizon are brighter and more scattered. Amid all the lists on my wall is a printout of the email from my friend, the astrologer. 'By May, the pattern will have changed completely,' it says. 'It'll be like a load lifting off your shoulders, and you'll be smelling the flowers and earth on the winds of spring.'</p> <p>He doesn't say anything about my book becoming a bestseller, though...</p> <p>Sam Taylor will be writing occasional bulletins for the Review on his family's new life in France</p>",

      "bodyText": "Why? people asking me incredulously. Why does a 30-year-old pop writer suddenly want to decamp to rural France? That's what they said to start with. When they learnt that I barely speak French, and my wife and I had chosen the area we wanted to live before we'd even been there, they tended to conclude that I must be mad. Now, having moved here a week ago, I wonder if they were right. I'm in my new office, on the first floor of a large stone house, surrounded by unopened cardboard boxes, staring out of the window. In the garden, there are piles of logs and bare fruit trees; beyond it, fields of maize stumps and grass, hills covered by forest; and looming behind them, white on the horizon, are the Pyrenees. It's 20 minutes' walk to the nearest village (population 364), which has a school but no shop. Our closest neighbours are half a mile away. The only sound is the hum of my computer and, if I open the window, the twittering of birds. It's all beautiful but a little bit scary. Six months ago, I was in Ibiza watching Kylie Minogue; now I'm living in a place where mobile phones don't work and most radio signals are just a blizzard of interference. There have been times when I've wondered what on earth drove me to uproot my young family from the comfort and security of our home, job and friends in southern England and bring them to this remote place. My lowest moment so far was three nights ago, when my eldest son woke me up at 4.30am and I couldn't get back to sleep. I lay next to him in bed, in shuttered blackness, worrying about money and woodworm, insulation and isolation, septic tanks and verb-endings. Another time, frustrated and exhausted by trying to feed the kids, get hold of an electrician and find the box containing our wellies among the 200 others littering the house, I did actually yell: 'Right, that's it! We're putting the house on the market and moving back to England!' But then the idea seemed so absurd that we started laughing. My great escape began last year with those familiar pangs we all feel when we come back from a holiday - in the mountains or the countryside or by the sea - and get the Tube from Heathrow in the drizzle. The pangs didn't fade as they usually do but intensified with every walk to school in our Hertfordshire village, having to stoop down next to my son's face so I could hear what he was saying above the noise of traffic on the high street. We'd moved there five years earlier from east London, to 'get away from it'. But 'it' had followed us, and was now busy building an apartment block 30 yards from our front door. Everything happened extremely fast, which helped prevent us losing our nerve and staying put. Last May, my wife and I spent two weeks travelling around Provence and Languedoc, peering hopefully into dozens of estate agents' windows. It was lovely, but almost as expensive as London. Then we read about a region called the Gers, in south-west France, where prices were lower and tourists fewer. We looked at the map and thought: that's where we'll live. After weeks spent sorting through property on the internet, we went over in October and saw five houses that we loved. The last of these was in a region south of the Gers, closer to the Spanish border, where prices were even lower and tourists even fewer. Thirty-six hours after selling our old house, we bought the new one. If there was a kind of madness in the fervour with which we pursued this dream, there were also lots of sensible reasons for doing it now: my wife is French, my three children are still young enough to learn the language effortlessly, most of my family lives abroad (my parents in southern Spain, my brother and his family in Madrid), and the massive rise in house prices in south-east England over the past few years meant we could sell our Edwardian semi in Hertfordshire for twice what we paid for it and buy somewhere twice as big, set in five acres of land, for half that price. Now we have no mortgage, which is useful as my monthly income is currently less than I used to spend on the mortgage alone. I had other reasons for escaping - not so easy to explain to financial advisers and social scientists. Turning 30 was part of it; the realisation that I was probably a third of the way through my life; the sense that I was playing things too safe. I had what in many ways was my dream job - writing about music for a national newspaper. Yet somewhere, swirling around my subconscious, was the dim fear of sleepwalking into my forties, numbed by comfort and routine. The times in my life I felt most alive, I realised, were when I was faced with a big new change or challenge - leaving home, falling in love, looking for a job, having children. According to an astrologer friend, this was my Saturn's return - the stars were influencing me to change my way of life. And before you start laughing, I should point out that I have an email from this friend, sent last May, predicting every major event of the last six months with startling accuracy. Besides, however enjoyable my job, I felt that, to quote Philip Larkin, 'the toad Work' was squatting on too large a portion of my life. Contemporary sociological phenomena with names like 'the play ethic' and 'downshifting' are, essentially, just determined attempts to spend less time immobile under striplights, breathing recycled air, concentrating on something that will cease to be truly important the moment you have finished doing it. How you spend the time you save is up to you, but I realised I wanted to spend it making my kids laugh, chopping wood, writing books, digging up vegetables, skiing, feeding chickens, playing tennis, cooking over an open fire, or, just occasionally, sitting in the sun, drinking wine and gazing at the Pyrenees. Other parents, not least my own, tend to look at me anxiously when I tell them this, imagining my three boys starving to death for the sake of my stress levels. I certainly have no illusions about poverty - it's a grind and no fun at all. But despite one of my friends predicting merrily that I would end up 'rotting in peasant oblivion', I can't really see us suffering hypothermia or malnutrition. We will have two fireplaces, a vegetable garden, dozens of fruit trees and freshly laid eggs. It will be fine. That's what I told myself, and other people, over and over again as they questioned the wisdom of the move last autumn. It'll be fine, I said breezily, feeling it, meaning it. I was relentlessly optimistic. We'll just have to make a few small sacrifices, I said. I'll give up parties and Sky TV. My wife will wear wellies instead of kitten mules. The kids will miss out on micro-scooters and Versace jeans and their Pok\u00e9mon collections will be embarrassingly small. I think the scars will heal, somehow. Then, the day in October that I learnt our house sale had finally gone through, another emotion hit me. I caught sight of my face in a mirror and noticed my expression: I looked frightened. Oh God, I thought, what have I done? The panic attack lasted just one evening. I sat on the rug in front of the fire in our living-room and stared into the flames, imagining a series of worst-case scenarios. What if the villagers hate us? What if we're snowbound and the boiler packs up? It was raining outside and there was no alcohol in the house to dull the fear. My wife watched me curiously. 'It'll be fine,' she said, with just a trace of irony. By the next morning, miraculously, it was. I must confess that I rather enjoyed the bleak horrors of our last November in England - the floods, the rail delays, the circulating flu viruses. By this point, most people had stopped questioning my sanity and were asking slightly enviously about the place I was going to: a blessed little corner of south-west France made up of gently rolling hills, fields of corn and sunflowers, winding roads empty of cars and pretty little towns and villages, where, like the nostalgic myth of pre-war England, people don't bother locking their doors and always have time to talk to you. It's like an unspoilt Tuscany or Provence, and I'd better shut up now or I'll be responsible for spoiling it. But nothing is as perfect or as easy as it seems in your dreams. However adaptable kids are, they still scream when you leave them in a school full of people speaking a language they barely understand. However relieved I feel to be free of traffic and train delays, I still have huge lists of 'things to do' pinned to the wall above my desk. Even down here it still rains. Looking out of my office window, I see the clouds overhead are dark and thick but the ones on the horizon are brighter and more scattered. Amid all the lists on my wall is a printout of the email from my friend, the astrologer. 'By May, the pattern will have changed completely,' it says. 'It'll be like a load lifting off your shoulders, and you'll be smelling the flowers and earth on the winds of spring.' He doesn't say anything about my book becoming a bestseller, though...

The trouble is, keeping the same costs on a low sales base meant it actually made an operating loss in the first half. </p> <p>His strategy certainly sounds more sensible than that of his predecessor, David Simons, who bought Kwik Save and promptly ditched its name and discount formula. </p> <p>Von Spreckelsen is revers ing that, giving stores a facelift and making some sensible changes to operations. </p> <p>In Somerfield, he is pursuing the same strategy as he did, with success, at Budgens: making it a well-run, good-value high street store. That includes brightening the store, improving service and adding more convenience and fresh foods. </p> <p>The trouble is, it has too many superstores - which it could not sell - to be purely high street, but not enough big stores to be truly competitive on price with its larger rivals. The risk is that it remains a chain with no niche in the market. </p> <p>The task of finding a niche is getting harder all the time. Christmas trading statements from Tesco and Safeway - and Wm Morrison earlier in the month - showed that both are aggressively building market share. Some of that will be coming from Sainsbury's - which says it is not yet ready to go for sales growth - but much of it will be coming from the high street stores, which von Spreckelsen is trying to nurse back to life. If Sainsbury's does actually start going for growth again, life will get tougher still. </p> <p>Peter Davis at Sainsbury's has warned that turning it round will take five years. Von Spreckelsen wants even longer - he thinks it could take five years to get Somerfield back into a decent condition. His patience certainly paid off at Budgens, which was all but written off when he took over. </p> <p>Somerfield's shares have doubled recently, suggesting that investors are at least willing to take a bet on von Spreckelsen succeeding.

Virtually all of us have a relationship of some kind with at least one of the high street banks yet, despite years of effort, the banks manage to sell less than one investment product in every seven we buy. Barclays thinks the answer may be that banks come somewhere below estate agents in the list of those we would trust to give us a good deal, so it has decided to turn the business over to someone we appear to have a bit more respect for. Out will go Barclays Life, Barclays Funds and even b2, rather expensively created just three years ago. In will come that rather reassuring multi-coloured umbrella from Legal &amp; General.

      "body": "<p>When he picked up the phone on a Saturday afternoon in the middle of December last year, Daniel Levy's Christmas came early. </p> <p>Levy's solicitors, SJ Berwin, were on the line with the news the lifelong Spurs fan had waited two years to hear. Alan Sugar, the beleaguered Tottenham Hotspur chairman, was throwing in the towel. Sugar wanted to know whether Levy's company, Enic, which owns stakes in five European clubs, was interested in buying him out. </p> <p>The Amstrad founder had offered his stake to Levy twice before, as far back as 1998, but the chief executive of the English National Investment Company had balked at the price. However, this time Sugar was desperate to get out. He was jetting off on holiday and wanted an agreement before he hit the beach. Levy rushed out of his Chigwell mansion, summoned his advisers and decamped to Enic's HQ, just off London's Regent Street, where they hastily put together an offer. </p> <p>Four days later, on 20 December, Spurs announced that Enic was to buy a 27 per cent stake in the football club for \u00a322 million and that Levy would have a place on the board. Drawing on the clich\u00e9s beloved by all millionaires when grabbing the keys to the stadium, Levy, a Cambridge economics graduate, talked about making Spurs great again. 'We believe that it can regain its position as a significant contender in both domestic and European competitions,' the 39-year-old said portentously. </p> <p>Enic's shareholders, however, can be forgiven for wondering what's in it for them. Football clubs are notoriously flaky investments, and for Sugar to sell out at a huge discount to his original asking price (at one stage he wanted almost double what Enic was offering) suggests that even one of the UK's toughest businessmen isn't optimistic about the future of the beautiful game. </p> <p>Enic's share price certainly hasn't shown much enthusiasm for the Spurs deal. No one has been quite sure in what direction the company is going. Observers who've tried to glean a better understanding have often come away confused. 'It's been like pulling teeth,' one said. </p> <p>Formed five years ago, Enic, the brainchild of legendary Bahamas-based billionaire Joe Lewis, is a very strange corporate beast. Although Lewis is no longer involved in Enic, his son Charles, who cut his teeth opening franchises of the Planet Hollywood restaurant chain in South America, is an Enic director. In addition, the Lewis family retains a 21 per cent stake in the firm. </p> <p>Enic has fingers in many pies. In addition to its football operations, Enic has an 80 per cent holding in the company that owns the 15-strong chain of Warner Brothers merchandising stores in the UK. It also has the rights to develop a worldwide restaurant franchise themed around cartoon characters such as Bugs Bunny and Tom and Jerry. The first restaurant is slap bang in the middle of the Las Vegas gambling strip. </p> <p>Enic is also a fan of new media companies. It retains a 3 per cent stake in Autonomy, the internet software company currently worth more than \u00a32.5bn. At one stage Enic owned more than 20 per cent of the Cambridge-based firm, which was once worth more than \u00a35bn. </p> <p>Then there is a 24 per cent stake in technology investment vehicle Paradigm Media Investments. Enic also owns 25 per cent of the internet gambling operations of Victor Chandler International and is in negotiations to buy the company outright. </p> <p>It is also in talks to buy spread-betting firm Sporting Index to sit alongside UK Betting.com, the online bookmaker it bought for \u00a3500,000 a couple of years ago. </p> <p>Last year Enic audaciously tried to buy Wembley stadium. It was also keen on owning a chunk of Manchester United when its former chairman, Martin Edwards, looked to sell. </p> <p>Given its diverse portfolio of interests and the apparent confusion over its direction in this, the era of corporate focus, it is hardly surprising that the City has taken a dim view of Enic. True, it may have seen its value soar to more than \u00a3300m last year, but this was because its stake in Autonomy helped it ride the dotcom boom. </p> <p>And, worryingly for Levy, his company is now trading at a significant discount to its net assets, which suggests concern about the management's strategy. Adding up all the various interests the company holds, in addition to cash reserves of around \u00a325m, should give Enic a book value of \u00a3220m-\u00a3300m, a long way north of its current \u00a3110m market capitalisation. </p> <p>But, with the exception of the Autonomy investment, too many of Enic's deals have failed to come off. Paradigm, for example, has yet to make an investment. Launched amid great hype on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) in March last year - just before the internet bubble burst, Paradigm's shares are today trading at 9p - where once they changed hands at 38p. </p> <p>The performance of the Warner Brothers stores, even in the company's view, has been 'disappointing'. In a bid to retrench, Enic has switched out of running big stores into smaller ones. Soon its flagship store on Regent Street, over which Enic has its HQ, will go, to be replaced by a giant Esprit outlet. </p> <p>Admittedly, the US restaurant in Vegas makes money, but it sucked in \u00a311m of Enic cash to get going: the company is understandably reluctant to shell out more. And, despite the hype surrounding media sports rights and pay-per-view TV, most analysts would agree that football clubs have so far failed to become the cash cows many were predicting a couple of years ago. </p> <p>In a bid to gain credibility with the City, Levy will now almost certainly look to restructure the company. The current deal to buy Victor Chandler outright looks dead in the water - Enic is now refusing to pay the \u00a370m million asking price. The Sporting Index deal will go the same way unless a new price can be agreed. </p> <p>Paradigm, meanwhile, is to focus on one major acquisition rather than the original plan to make several minority investments. Plans are being drawn up to hive off the Warner Brothers stores as a separate concern. The remaining Autonomy stake will go sometime, too. </p> <p>Which pretty much just leaves the football interests. 'Now they've achieved a certain size, thanks to the Spurs deal, they can focus on their core expertise: developing brands in sport and the media,' one source close to the company said. </p> <p>But even mighty Manchester United is cutting back on its licensing ventures. </p> <p>At least Enic now seems to have found a focus. But, as one observer put it: 'If it didn't exist, you wouldn't invent it.'</p>",

      "body": "<p>We laughed, of course. All those Californians stumbling in the dark, wondering why the sun had left the Sunshine State, made for great schadenfreude. Silicon Valley, for so long held up as the powerhouse that powered all powerhouses, ran out of power. As California's governor declared a state of emergency, restaurateurs started a nice line in candlelit suppers. </p> <p>But it's not really funny. Not when schools and businesses face blackouts. And it's especially unfunny given that such a crisis in the world's most developed country should never have happened. </p> <p>We in the UK shake our heads in bewilderment. But we shouldn't feel too comfortable. US-style electricity deregulation may be over-priced and over-complicated but it is also coming over here. The fiasco in the US becomes more than a sideshow. </p> <p>The Great Silicon Valley Switch-Off is testament to what happens when those in power meddle in the affairs of those with power. Deregulation of electricity might have looked good in theory - Uncle Sam loves free markets, after all. In practice it has proved nothing short of a disaster. </p> <p>Despite the Valley's thirst for ever more megawatts to fuel all those server farms that underpin the internet, no new power plant has been built in California for 10 years - because the electricity companies have been scared. Put simply, they don't trust the federal and state governments, which have been ambiguous and ambivalent on how the electricity industry should be opened up. </p> <p>The deregulation of the Californian electricity market three years ago split generation and distribution. But while the utility companies had the price they could charge to consumers capped, the wholesale electricity system that sold to the utilities faced no such restriction. When wholesale prices rocketed, the utility companies took a massive hit and had to supply power at huge losses. The result: two utilities face bankruptcy. </p> <p>The US is not alone. Australian regulators have also capped prices with similar, if less disastrous, results. </p> <p>Ofgem, the UK electricity regulator, will want to learn the lessons. In March, after two postponements, it will introduce the catchily titled New Energy Trading Arrangement. </p> <p>Neta has been designed to make the electricity market more competitive and transparent. No longer will the price of electricity in the pool be held in a collar. Instead, prices will be chiefly determined by the conventional laws of supply and demand. This, it is forecast, will reduce consumers' bills up to 10 per cent. </p> <p>But the problem with electricity is that you can't store it. In a free market its price will change dramatically, by the hour. As David Warwick of KWI, the trading and risk management company that advises energy firms, points out: 'Expect to see very high prices over certain periods. You could see some violent price swings.' </p> <p>This could be a nightmare for heavy users. Increasingly companies will have to rely on forward planning - buying up electricity contracts in the futures markets. In the US it is not uncommon for firms to buy five-year contracts to offset the volatility. </p> <p>UK firms that fail to smooth out Neta's jagged peaks might find themselves having some sympathy with California's utilities.</p>",

      "bodyText": "We laughed, of course. All those Californians stumbling in the dark, wondering why the sun had left the Sunshine State, made for great schadenfreude. Silicon Valley, for so long held up as the powerhouse that powered all powerhouses, ran out of power. As California's governor declared a state of emergency, restaurateurs started a nice line in candlelit suppers. But it's not really funny. Not when schools and businesses face blackouts. And it's especially unfunny given that such a crisis in the world's most developed country should never have happened. We in the UK shake our heads in bewilderment. But we shouldn't feel too comfortable. US-style electricity deregulation may be over-priced and over-complicated but it is also coming over here. The fiasco in the US becomes more than a sideshow. The Great Silicon Valley Switch-Off is testament to what happens when those in power meddle in the affairs of those with power. Deregulation of electricity might have looked good in theory - Uncle Sam loves free markets, after all. In practice it has proved nothing short of a disaster. Despite the Valley's thirst for ever more megawatts to fuel all those server farms that underpin the internet, no new power plant has been built in California for 10 years - because the electricity companies have been scared. Put simply, they don't trust the federal and state governments, which have been ambiguous and ambivalent on how the electricity industry should be opened up. The deregulation of the Californian electricity market three years ago split generation and distribution. But while the utility companies had the price they could charge to consumers capped, the wholesale electricity system that sold to the utilities faced no such restriction. When wholesale prices rocketed, the utility companies took a massive hit and had to supply power at huge losses. The result: two utilities face bankruptcy. The US is not alone. Australian regulators have also capped prices with similar, if less disastrous, results. Ofgem, the UK electricity regulator, will want to learn the lessons. In March, after two postponements, it will introduce the catchily titled New Energy Trading Arrangement. Neta has been designed to make the electricity market more competitive and transparent. No longer will the price of electricity in the pool be held in a collar. Instead, prices will be chiefly determined by the conventional laws of supply and demand. This, it is forecast, will reduce consumers' bills up to 10 per cent. But the problem with electricity is that you can't store it. In a free market its price will change dramatically, by the hour. As David Warwick of KWI, the trading and risk management company that advises energy firms, points out: 'Expect to see very high prices over certain periods. You could see some violent price swings.' This could be a nightmare for heavy users. Increasingly companies will have to rely on forward planning - buying up electricity contracts in the futures markets. In the US it is not uncommon for firms to buy five-year contracts to offset the volatility. UK firms that fail to smooth out Neta's jagged peaks might find themselves having some sympathy with California's utilities.",

      "body": "<p>Last Tuesday, from its headquarters at Vevey on the picturesque shores of Lac Leman, Switzerland's sleeping giant finally stirred. </p> <p>During 2000, Nestl\u00e9, the world's biggest food producer, had stood aloof as the industry carved itself up in a $50 billion frenzy of US takeovers not seen since the Gordon Gekko days of the lunatic late 1980s. </p> <p>In the space of just 12 months some of the world's best-known grocery brands - such as Nabisco, Pillsbury, Quaker Oats, Knorr and Ben &amp; Jerry's - fell to the likes of Philip Morris, Pepsico and Unilever, Nestl\u00e9's keenest rivals for supermarket space around the world. Yet from Nestl\u00e9 barely a murmur was heard. </p> <p>Under its fearsome former chief, Helmut Maucher, the Swiss giant was hardly a shrinking violet when it came to shoring up its vital interests in the 1980s and 1990s. It decisively saw off Germany's Jacobs Suchard in 1988 in the \u00a32.8bn takeover battle for the UK's Rowntree Mackintosh. It also routed the super-rich Agnellis, owners of Fiat, and the French establishment in the \u00a31.6bn tussle for Perrier four years later. </p> <p>It was Maucher, too, who drove the maker of Nescaf\u00e9, Milky Bar, Buitoni pasta and Branston Pickle aggressively into new growth markets like mineral waters, ice cream and petfood. And Nestl\u00e9's cereals venture with General Mills of the US, producing Shredded Wheat, Cheerios and Golden Grahams, has also now knocked the mighty Kelloggs off its pole position in the US. </p> <p>But in the new millennium, it was as if his successor, new chief executive Peter Brabeck, was content to watch the steamers paddle lazily by in Nestl\u00e9's picture-postcard lakeside setting. </p> <p>Then, on Tuesday, the apparent somnolence was over. Nestl\u00e9's $10.3bn bid for St Louis-based Ralston Purina - maker of Dog Chow, Meouw Mix and Tender Vittles, no less - means Nestl\u00e9 takes the number one slot with Mars' Pedigree Petfoods in the business of feeding little furry friends the world over. Canned and dry cat and dogfood may not be glamorous. But it is a $25bn a year global market, growing twice as fast as food for mere humans. </p> <p>You may not realise it, but the world's biggest purveyor of chocolate and instant coffee already owns Felix, Friskies and Winalot (with neat symmetry, Mars sells Whiskas and Chum). And last week's move in particular freezes out Procter &amp; Gamble, the ultra-secretive US Fairy Liquid giant, which has cast avaricious eyes over this lucrative grocery trade. </p> <p>It shows, too, that Nestl\u00e9 has not lost the 135-year knack of looking ahead that allowed a tiny Swiss company to conquer the world in the first place. Let the also-rans scrap for the canned sweetcorn, powdered soups and packet cereals falling from the food consolidation table (from all of which Nestl\u00e9 has done very nicely in the past, thank you). Under Brabeck - who took charge three years ago - the Swiss are now checking out higher margin, fast-growth areas like healthy nutrition, supplements and lifestyle food and drinks. And, as with Nescaf\u00e9, baby formula and condensed milk in the past, so, the thinking goes, with Nespresso, internet cafes and Felix Gourmet catfoods in the future. In other words, where the developed world leads, fast-growing, emerging markets follow. </p> <p>'Nestl\u00e9 has always been remarkably long-term. One of the great advantages they have had is visionaries at the top able to shoulder a global empire,' says Kieron Mahon, European foods analyst at broker Schroder Salomon Smith Barney. 'While Peter Brabeck has yet to prove himself, there is little doubt he is a force to be reckoned with.' </p> <p>Founded in 1866 by Henri Nestl\u00e9, a pharmacist-turned-entrepreneur, the firm looked beyond Swiss borders from day one. Its first overseas sales office was set up in London in 1867 and Nestl\u00e9 now has 27 factories and distribution centres in the UK, which employ over 13,000 of its total of 230,000 staff. </p> <p>In all, Nestl\u00e9 now runs more than 500 food manufacturing plants in 77 countries worldwide. </p> <p>In the beginning, Henri had a product everyone - from the Victorians to Tsarist Russians and colonial Australians - wanted: the world's first formula baby milk, made from dried milk and sugar and sold without frills as Farine Lact\u00e9e Henri Nestl\u00e9. </p> <p>In 1874, Henri sold out, meaning Nestl\u00e9 has never had successive generations of squabbling, less-talented family members holding the firm back. And in 1905 came the first merger, with the Anglo Swiss Condensed Milk Company, which put a halt to vicious European competition in processed milk products. </p> <p>Eighty years later, with the takeover of Carnation in the US, Nestl\u00e9 returned to its roots (and accidentally got into petfood: Carnation had a thriving sideline in Friskies). </p> <p>In 1929, chocolate joined the pot, with the takeover of fellow Vevey-based firm Peter-Cailler-Kohler, founded by a friend of Henri's who invented the process of combining milk with cocoa powder to make milk chocolate. </p> <p>And in 1938, Nestl\u00e9's best-known product of all was launched. After eight years of research aimed at cutting Brazil's huge coffee surplus, the firm's chemists finally produced a soluble powder that revolutionised coffee-drinking habits worldwide. In short, Nescafe was born, and in the Second World War it quickly became the staple drink of American soldiers serving in Europe and Asia. </p> <p>Since then, Nestl\u00e9 - bankrolled by the cash cow of instant coffee - has never looked back. Worldwide, it now makes thousands of products with sales of \u00a330bn a year. Of those, \u00a32.3bn are in the UK, Nestl\u00e9's fourth largest market, with brands that also include Nesquik, Sarsons Vinegar and Sun Pat peanut butter. </p> <p>'The main secret of Nestl\u00e9's success is that it has always been a company which looked at social need, used scientific research to develop products and used brands to make it happen,' says Nestl\u00e9's communications director Francois Perraud. 'It was helpful, too, to come from a small country so we had to drive sales internationally.' </p> <p>Today, with nearly a fifth of the global market, Nestl\u00e9 is still by far the biggest supplier of baby milk and infant foods, dwarfing the likes of Heinz and the Netherlands' Numico (owner of Milupa and Cow &amp; Gate). </p> <p>Not that young British mothers would readily link the Swiss with baby milk. Save for the quiet introduction of its Nestl\u00e9 Junior toddler foods a year ago, Nestl\u00e9 has steered clear of the UK since a global boycott was organised by London protesters in the 1970s. </p> <p>The group, Baby Milk Action, still harries Nestl\u00e9 over controversial Third World marketing practices, which have allegedly led to thousands of baby deaths after mothers mixed unsterilised water with powdered infant formula instead of breastfeeding. </p> <p>Ever agile at marketing, however, Nestl\u00e9 is now using its number one position in mineral waters - with Perrier, Vittel and San Pellegrino - to launch a new purified water, Nestl\u00e9 Pure Life, for mass markets in China, Pakistan and Mexico. </p> <p>After Nestl\u00e9's far-sighted expansion under Maucher, the new chief had until last week vowed to pursue organic growth, rationalising the far-flung empire to cut costs and boost returns. For Nestl\u00e9, Ralston Purina was just a bite-sized in-fill deal, but there are other itches that the ambitious Brabeck would certainly love to scratch. </p> <p>He could do, for example, with a decent yoghurt - with all the healthy living connotations - to take on France's Danone. Nestl\u00e9 bought Chambourcy in the 1970s, but this is now a 'double or quits market', analysts say. So watch out Germany's M\u00fcller. </p> <p>Ice cream also needs sorting out. Nestl\u00e9 jettisoned the Lyons Maid label in 1998, has tied up with Haagen Dazs and spent a small fortune on making its ice cream operations the world number two, but the division is barely profitable and still a long way behind Unilever's Walls. </p> <p>For the health-driven future, GlaxoSmithKline's consumer health products, like Horlicks. Lucozade and Ribena, would figure on Nestl\u00e9's shopping list. Higher priority, however, are the Mead Johnson operations of US drugs giant Bristol Myers Squibb, which make nutritional food and drinks for infants, adults, hospitals and other health professionals. BMS, analysts say, may be a willing seller, but it first needs to find an acceptable pharmaceuticals merger. </p> <p>BMS's Clairol hair care operation would also fit well with L'Or\u00e9al, Nestl\u00e9's ultimate prize. In 1974, the Swiss giant made its shrewdest ever investment, taking a 49 per cent stake in Gesparal, the family holding company that owns a controlling 54 per cent stake in L'Oreal. The French firm has since become the world leader in personal care. Nestl\u00e9 has waited patiently for L'Oreal's ageing owner, Lillian Bettancourt, to give it the chance to buy the lot. </p> <p>That deal would take Nestl\u00e9 head to head with Unilever, with the added spice of knocking its European rival off its perch as the world's number one in consumer goods. </p> <p>'Nestl\u00e9 has no interest in canned beans, but it has an abiding interest in L'Or\u00e9al,' said Schroders' Mahon. 'Personally, I think Brabeck will be disappointed if he doesn't capture L'Or\u00e9al by the time he retires. Maucher built the world's number one food and beverage company; Brabeck dreams of the world's number one consumer company.' </p> <p><strong>Land where the gnomes are giants</strong></p> <p>For a small, land-locked country with just 7 million inhabitants, Switzerland has a surprisingly strong industrial and financial base. Several Swiss corporations apart from Nestl\u00e9 are a force to be reckoned with - in drugs and banking, in particular.</p> <p><strong> Roche</strong> </p> <p>Founded in 1896, Roche is the country's other sleeping giant. Once the world's biggest drugs company, Basle-based Roche has missed out in the merger wave that recently swept through the global pharmaceuticals industry. </p> <p>With sales of \u00a312 billion, Roche is now the world's ninth-biggest drugs company, with a thriving vitamins business including the Sanatogen brand. Still family-controlled, it is immune from takeover. </p> <p><strong> Novartis</strong> </p> <p>Created in 1996 by the merger of Roche's Basle-based rivals, Sandoz and Ciba-Geigy, Novartis ranks among the world's top three drugs companies, with sales of \u00a314bn a year. The group also owns consumer brands including Ovaltine and Isostar (sports drinks), plus Gerber, the number one baby food company in the US. The consumer brands are likely to be sold in the future if, as expected, Novartis merges with another rival to take on the might of Britain's GlaxoSmithKline and US drugs giant Merck. </p> <p>Roche, of course, is one candidate for an all-Swiss solution. Nestl\u00e9, however, is likely to face competition problems in buying much of the consumer arm. </p> <p><strong> UBS</strong> </p> <p>Formed in 1998 from the merger of Union Bank of Switzerland and Swiss Bank Corporation, UBS is the country's heavyweight in the world banking league. </p> <p>Swiss neutrality throughout two world wars insulated the country from running up massive debts and provided a sound footing for Zurich's infamous gnomes to rival the Americans and the Germans in world banking. </p> <p>In 1996, UBS snapped up Warburg, one of the grandest names in the City of London, to make a success of investment banking where British rivals have failed. </p> <p>Last year, too, the bank bought Wall Street's Paine Webber for $12bn to cement its global position. </p> <p><strong> Credit Suisse</strong> </p> <p>Frozen out by the UBS deal, Credit Suisse is to Swiss banking what Roche is to drugs: a strong number two with a huge international presence. </p> <p>Its investment banking arm, Credit Suisse First Boston has long been a top-rank player on Wall Street. In 1997, CSFB also bought BZW, Barclays' investment banking arm, to underline Swiss, German and US dominance in the City.</p>",

'It was helpful, too, to come from a small country so we had to drive sales internationally.' Today, with nearly a fifth of the global market, Nestl\u00e9 is still by far the biggest supplier of baby milk and infant foods, dwarfing the likes of Heinz and the Netherlands' Numico (owner of Milupa and Cow &amp; Gate). Not that young British mothers would readily link the Swiss with baby milk. Save for the quiet introduction of its Nestl\u00e9 Junior toddler foods a year ago, Nestl\u00e9 has steered clear of the UK since a global boycott was organised by London protesters in the 1970s. The group, Baby Milk Action, still harries Nestl\u00e9 over controversial Third World marketing practices, which have allegedly led to thousands of baby deaths after mothers mixed unsterilised water with powdered infant formula instead of breastfeeding. Ever agile at marketing, however, Nestl\u00e9 is now using its number one position in mineral waters - with Perrier, Vittel and San Pellegrino - to launch a new purified water, Nestl\u00e9 Pure Life, for mass markets in China, Pakistan and Mexico. After Nestl\u00e9's far-sighted expansion under Maucher, the new chief had until last week vowed to pursue organic growth, rationalising the far-flung empire to cut costs and boost returns. For Nestl\u00e9, Ralston Purina was just a bite-sized in-fill deal, but there are other itches that the ambitious Brabeck would certainly love to scratch. He could do, for example, with a decent yoghurt - with all the healthy living connotations - to take on France's Danone. Nestl\u00e9 bought Chambourcy in the 1970s, but this is now a 'double or quits market', analysts say. So watch out Germany's M\u00fcller. Ice cream also needs sorting out. Nestl\u00e9 jettisoned the Lyons Maid label in 1998, has tied up with Haagen Dazs and spent a small fortune on making its ice cream operations the world number two, but the division is barely profitable and still a long way behind Unilever's Walls. For the health-driven future, GlaxoSmithKline's consumer health products, like Horlicks. Lucozade and Ribena, would figure on Nestl\u00e9's shopping list. Higher priority, however, are the Mead Johnson operations of US drugs giant Bristol Myers Squibb, which make nutritional food and drinks for infants, adults, hospitals and other health professionals. BMS, analysts say, may be a willing seller, but it first needs to find an acceptable pharmaceuticals merger. BMS's Clairol hair care operation would also fit well with L'Or\u00e9al, Nestl\u00e9's ultimate prize. In 1974, the Swiss giant made its shrewdest ever investment, taking a 49 per cent stake in Gesparal, the family holding company that owns a controlling 54 per cent stake in L'Oreal. The French firm has since become the world leader in personal care. Nestl\u00e9 has waited patiently for L'Oreal's ageing owner, Lillian Bettancourt, to give it the chance to buy the lot. That deal would take Nestl\u00e9 head to head with Unilever, with the added spice of knocking its European rival off its perch as the world's number one in consumer goods. 'Nestl\u00e9 has no interest in canned beans, but it has an abiding interest in L'Or\u00e9al,' said Schroders' Mahon. 'Personally, I think Brabeck will be disappointed if he doesn't capture L'Or\u00e9al by the time he retires. Maucher built the world's number one food and beverage company; Brabeck dreams of the world's number one consumer company.' Land where the gnomes are giants For a small, land-locked country with just 7 million inhabitants, Switzerland has a surprisingly strong industrial and financial base. Several Swiss corporations apart from Nestl\u00e9 are a force to be reckoned with - in drugs and banking, in particular. Roche Founded in 1896, Roche is the country's other sleeping giant. Once the world's biggest drugs company, Basle-based Roche has missed out in the merger wave that recently swept through the global pharmaceuticals industry. With sales of \u00a312 billion, Roche is now the world's ninth-biggest drugs company, with a thriving vitamins business including the Sanatogen brand. Still family-controlled, it is immune from takeover. Novartis Created in 1996 by the merger of Roche's Basle-based rivals, Sandoz and Ciba-Geigy, Novartis ranks among the world's top three drugs companies, with sales of \u00a314bn a year. The group also owns consumer brands including Ovaltine and Isostar (sports drinks), plus Gerber, the number one baby food company in the US. The consumer brands are likely to be sold in the future if, as expected, Novartis merges with another rival to take on the might of Britain's GlaxoSmithKline and US drugs giant Merck. Roche, of course, is one candidate for an all-Swiss solution. Nestl\u00e9, however, is likely to face competition problems in buying much of the consumer arm. UBS Formed in 1998 from the merger of Union Bank of Switzerland and Swiss Bank Corporation, UBS is the country's heavyweight in the world banking league. Swiss neutrality throughout two world wars insulated the country from running up massive debts and provided a sound footing for Zurich's infamous gnomes to rival the Americans and the Germans in world banking. In 1996, UBS snapped up Warburg, one of the grandest names in the City of London, to make a success of investment banking where British rivals have failed. Last year, too, the bank bought Wall Street's Paine Webber for $12bn to cement its global position. Credit Suisse Frozen out by the UBS deal, Credit Suisse is to Swiss banking what Roche is to drugs: a strong number two with a huge international presence. Its investment banking arm, Credit Suisse First Boston has long been a top-rank player on Wall Street. In 1997, CSFB also bought BZW, Barclays' investment banking arm, to underline Swiss, German and US dominance in the City.",

Any 'accident' that might erode Labour's huge lead in the polls would have to be very big indeed. Nevertheless, Gordon Brown is not a man to tempt providence, and promises a cautious Budget. </p> <p>Which brings us back to the Bank of England and its Monetary Policy Committee. One of the points Treasury officials - not just Labour appointees - are fond of making is that there was a regular pattern in the Eighties and Nineties of Conservative Chancellors cutting interest rates, either on Budget day or a day or so after. </p> <p>One of the good things about the new arrangement, they say, is that this kind of blatantly political manipulation of monetary policy no longer occurs. </p> <p>Now, there is a growing clamour for interest rate cuts in the UK, and, by some amazing coincidence, the MPC will be meeting on 7 and 8 March, just after the Tuesday 6 March date currently pencilled in for the Budget. What a turn-up for the books it would be if we were back to the old days, and the MPC lowered rates that week!

However, both the Chancellor and the Governor of the Bank have stressed that they do not see the 'knock-on effect' from the US slowdown that many others worry about. And the National Institute of Economic and Social Research judges that the UK economy has been temporarily depressed by the effects of the rail crisis, but that 'this does not indicate a general slowdown'. </p> <p>The temptation for the MPC must be towait and see. But if the economic outlook does deteriorate sharply, there is always an MPC meeting on 4 and 5 April - wonderfully timed to lift spirits with a rate cut at what could be the beginning of the election campaign. </p> <p>Meanwhile, one welcomes the recent falls in the pound. The fact is that beneath the veneer of the Chancellor's economic success a lot of damage has been done. The volume of exports rose by 38.5 per cent between 1995 and October 2000, whereas the volume of imports shot up by 57.7 per cent. The OECD estimates that between 1995 and 2000 unit labour costs in the UK rose by 45 per cent relative to other countries. </p> <p>Yet we still hear suggestions that 'manufacturing doesn't matter.' Oh yes it does. And rewriters of history could well consult an article by economist Gavyn Davies, written years ago, but reprinted in an interesting collection Double Takes (Wiley, IIMR) edited by John Goodchild and Clive Callow. </p> <p>As Davies points out: 'It is wrong to suggest that Britain's manufacturing industry was in relative decline before the arrival of oil. In virtually every economic cycle from the beginning of the industrial revolution up to and including the early Seventies, manufacturing was the fastest-growing sector in the economy, increasing its share of real output in the UK on a continuous basis; and in no sustained period before 1979 did the level of manufacturing production ever decline.' </p> <p>Exchange-rate policy, manufacturing and agriculture are crucially linked. Beneath the surface of this Government's economic popularity lie some disturbing trends. In 1999 manufacturing output was a mere 2.2 per cent above the 1995 level.

      "bodyText": "Littlewoods, the catalogue and department store group, faces further setbacks in its struggle to revitalise following a flat Christmas and disappointing January sales. The family-owned firm has cancelled its Christmas trading statement after sales in the first week of 2001 came in 25 per cent below budget. And sales in the crucial five weeks to the end of the year rose by just 2.1 per cent, despite cheaper prices under Littlewoods' new 'better value' retailing strategy. Littlewoods' continuing struggle comes as Mark &amp; Spencer prepares to announce a further collapse in clothing sales this week. Industry sources say menswear sales are down by up to 15 per cent, womenswear by 11 per cent and childrenswear by 8 per cent. The results from both chains demonstrate the problems that traditional high street names face in competing with new arrivals such as Matalan and New Look, and a highly successful Next. In December, Littlewoods announced losses of \u00a315.6 million following poor first-half trading and chaos at its catalogue warehouses. Around 200 jobs have already been lost in cost-cutting. The problems have also forced it to shelve a planned flotation and Littlewoods' City advisers are reviewing all options for the future. 'We've launched our new spring/summer catalogues and revamped our High Street stores,' Littlewoods corporate services director Jim Donovan said this weekend. 'We are expecting to see positive signs from that.' But internal accounts show sales barely moving in the first week of 2001, at \u00a325.9m against \u00a325.6m last year and a budgeted \u00a334.4m.

      "body": "<p>As a student, the architect John Pardey developed a passion for Sir Basil Spence's Coventry Cathedral. Although the rebuilt cathedral, completed in 1962, was the British public's favourite building of the 20th century (according to a survey by English Heritage), its creator is nowadays largely dismissed and vilified. While his other buildings include the Sussex University Meeting House and the Beehive (the executive wing of the New Zealand parliament) in Wellington, his name is largely associated with concrete monstrosities of the 60s. Yet, in Pardey's eyes, Spence managed to fuse 'romantic with modernism'. 'At his best,' he says, 'Spence made things poetic.'</p> <p>For Pardey, one of Spence's most poetic constructions was his own house, built in 1961 on the secluded and gently sloping north bank of the Beaulieu river in Hampshire. After Pardey himself moved to the same area some eight years ago, he decided to contact the present owners to ask if he could visit. 'Dear Spence House,' he wrote, 'I've long admired you and would love to come and see you.' In due course, a reply came from a London-based financier, and former architecture student, who had bought the house several years before in order to save it from certain demolition.</p> <p>'I knew the house back to front from studying drawings and photos of it,' recalls Pardey, 'and when I wandered in there, it was very much like meeting an old friend after many years. It was so familiar, yet aged. So dignified, yet crumpled. What particularly struck me was the power of the landscape. I really had not been prepared for that.' As chance would have it, the owner was planning to refurbish and extend the house, and on meeting Pardey, decided to entrust him with the job.</p> <p>Today, Pardey is a mine of information about the place. He tells you that Christine Keeler used to visit and that she carried out her affair with John Profumo just down the road. He also informs you that the round-the-world navigator Sir Francis Chichester attended parties there and that guests used to dive directly out of the first-floor window into the pool. 'It was quite a rocking place!'</p> <p>Spence, who died in 1976, built the house as a weekend retreat on land he purchased from Lord Montagu. The original structure was a slightly mono-pitched cedar-clad box, cantilevered over a brick ground floor. The upper floors housed the living quarters, while the lower one was given over to boat storage and a workshop space. Spence only lived there for about five years, before moving to the Mediterranean, but during that time, made several alterations. He glazed in the first-floor balcony to enlarge the living space. He turned part of the ground floor into a kitchen and dining room, and added on an octagonal timber stair tower with a spiral staircase to the east end of the house. He even toyed with the possibility of building an extension. Although planning permission was granted, it was never built.</p> <p>Still, it provided Pardey with guidelines when it came to the present renovation. Spence had planned to extend to the east and Pardey followed his lead, adding on a new wing with two bedrooms and a bathroom and connecting it to the original house via a glass bridge. Instead of imitating Spence's black timber, he clad the extension in natural, untreated cedar wood, which will turn grey with time, and made its dramatic focus the large bedroom window, which he claims is a sort of personal homage to the Italian architect Giuseppe Terragni. It also affords stunning views over the river. 'It would have been easy for the extension to be overpowered by the strong design of the Spence house,' he explains, 'and I wanted to have a single element to match its power.' The new wing provides a subtle, harmonious counterpart.</p> <p>Over the years, the maritime climate had taken its toll on the original structure. Before renovation work could take place, the timber box was encased in a scaffold-roofed, bubble-wrapped enclosure. Then, insulation and all new services were installed from the outside. Asbestos and 'all the horrors of 1960s architecture' were also removed, and the octagonal tower's timber container stripped away and replaced by glass. For Pardey, the new staircase is a conscious reference to the 'Chapel of Industry' at Coventry Cathedral. 'It acts as a kind of jewel,' he says. 'It really shimmers in the summer.'</p> <p>One particularly delicate feature proved to be the swimming pool, which was subsiding. In order to prevent the risk of the house sliding down towards the river, Pardey had to insert 47 poles into the ground in front of it before the new pool could be built. At the same time, the riverside pond was also rebuilt and a sculpture of a reclining woman commissioned for it from the artist Richard Lawrence. To the east of the garden stands a head carved out of Portland marble by Emily Young.</p> <p>Inside, the house is the perfect example of Pardey's style - 'clean, simple, but not simplistic. I'm interested in natural forms and materials,' he says, 'and I fuse that with a love of colour.' Spence painted all the original doors cadmium yellow and parts of the brickwork ultramarine, and Pardey has brought bright hues inside the house, too. The top of the walls and ceiling of the master bedroom are painted sky blue and offset by a vivid orange canvas by French artist Bruno de Fourmantelle. The corridors of the extension are bright yellow, and the cupboard doors and walls of the new kitchen area respectively yellow and dark blue. 'The kitchen is intended to be more a kind of workshop for catering,' he says. 'I tried to make it very earthy'.</p> <p>The adjoining dining room is more sophisticated with its Achille Castiglioni Frisbee light and dining table and chairs by Arne Jacobsen. The choice of the Danish architect's furnishings is far from arbitrary - the taps in every bathroom are also by him. Indeed, Pardey believes that Spence's design was largely inspired by two of Jacobsen's own residential projects - the Kofkelt House of 1957 and the Siesby House of 1959, which both explore the idea of a timber box perched over masonry.</p> <p>Spence House's pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance , however, remains the large, open-plan living room, with its Swedish redwood ceiling, ruddy afazalia floor and incredible, bush-hammered concrete fireplace by Ove Arup. 'It's a hell of a cantilever,' says Pardey. 'There must be a ton of concrete there.' For the room, Pardey commissioned two rugs from Helen Yardley, whose previous projects have included the British embassies in Moscow and Jakarta, as well as the Metropolitan Hotel and Disney Corporation headquarters in London. Pardey, for one, seems to be delighted with the results. 'This is the best 1960s space in Great Britain,' he says. 'There really is nowhere else quite so coherent and uncompromising.' And Sir Basil wouldn't have had it any other way.</p>",

He tells you that Christine Keeler used to visit and that she carried out her affair with John Profumo just down the road. He also informs you that the round-the-world navigator Sir Francis Chichester attended parties there and that guests used to dive directly out of the first-floor window into the pool. 'It was quite a rocking place!' Spence, who died in 1976, built the house as a weekend retreat on land he purchased from Lord Montagu. The original structure was a slightly mono-pitched cedar-clad box, cantilevered over a brick ground floor. The upper floors housed the living quarters, while the lower one was given over to boat storage and a workshop space. Spence only lived there for about five years, before moving to the Mediterranean, but during that time, made several alterations. He glazed in the first-floor balcony to enlarge the living space. He turned part of the ground floor into a kitchen and dining room, and added on an octagonal timber stair tower with a spiral staircase to the east end of the house. He even toyed with the possibility of building an extension. Although planning permission was granted, it was never built. Still, it provided Pardey with guidelines when it came to the present renovation. Spence had planned to extend to the east and Pardey followed his lead, adding on a new wing with two bedrooms and a bathroom and connecting it to the original house via a glass bridge. Instead of imitating Spence's black timber, he clad the extension in natural, untreated cedar wood, which will turn grey with time, and made its dramatic focus the large bedroom window, which he claims is a sort of personal homage to the Italian architect Giuseppe Terragni. It also affords stunning views over the river. 'It would have been easy for the extension to be overpowered by the strong design of the Spence house,' he explains, 'and I wanted to have a single element to match its power.' The new wing provides a subtle, harmonious counterpart. Over the years, the maritime climate had taken its toll on the original structure. Before renovation work could take place, the timber box was encased in a scaffold-roofed, bubble-wrapped enclosure. Then, insulation and all new services were installed from the outside. Asbestos and 'all the horrors of 1960s architecture' were also removed, and the octagonal tower's timber container stripped away and replaced by glass. For Pardey, the new staircase is a conscious reference to the 'Chapel of Industry' at Coventry Cathedral. 'It acts as a kind of jewel,' he says. 'It really shimmers in the summer.' One particularly delicate feature proved to be the swimming pool, which was subsiding. In order to prevent the risk of the house sliding down towards the river, Pardey had to insert 47 poles into the ground in front of it before the new pool could be built. At the same time, the riverside pond was also rebuilt and a sculpture of a reclining woman commissioned for it from the artist Richard Lawrence. To the east of the garden stands a head carved out of Portland marble by Emily Young. Inside, the house is the perfect example of Pardey's style - 'clean, simple, but not simplistic. I'm interested in natural forms and materials,' he says, 'and I fuse that with a love of colour.' Spence painted all the original doors cadmium yellow and parts of the brickwork ultramarine, and Pardey has brought bright hues inside the house, too. The top of the walls and ceiling of the master bedroom are painted sky blue and offset by a vivid orange canvas by French artist Bruno de Fourmantelle. The corridors of the extension are bright yellow, and the cupboard doors and walls of the new kitchen area respectively yellow and dark blue. 'The kitchen is intended to be more a kind of workshop for catering,' he says. 'I tried to make it very earthy'. The adjoining dining room is more sophisticated with its Achille Castiglioni Frisbee light and dining table and chairs by Arne Jacobsen. The choice of the Danish architect's furnishings is far from arbitrary - the taps in every bathroom are also by him. Indeed, Pardey believes that Spence's design was largely inspired by two of Jacobsen's own residential projects - the Kofkelt House of 1957 and the Siesby House of 1959, which both explore the idea of a timber box perched over masonry. Spence House's pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance , however, remains the large, open-plan living room, with its Swedish redwood ceiling, ruddy afazalia floor and incredible, bush-hammered concrete fireplace by Ove Arup. 'It's a hell of a cantilever,' says Pardey. 'There must be a ton of concrete there.' For the room, Pardey commissioned two rugs from Helen Yardley, whose previous projects have included the British embassies in Moscow and Jakarta, as well as the Metropolitan Hotel and Disney Corporation headquarters in London. Pardey, for one, seems to be delighted with the results. 'This is the best 1960s space in Great Britain,' he says. 'There really is nowhere else quite so coherent and uncompromising.' And Sir Basil wouldn't have had it any other way.",

      "body": "<p>The exercise season is upon us, January being the busiest time of the year at any gym as old members work off the excesses of Christmas and new ones the excesses of the past five years. But experts warn that we should proceed with care: throwing yourself too vigorously into a new fitness regime can make you vulnerable to a number of health risks, including osteoporosis and reduced fertility.</p> <p>'Exercise is a stress on the body,' says Dr Nick Webborn, medical advisor to the National Sports Medicine Institute. 'That's how it makes you fitter. You stimulate your body and it adapts to this stimulus by building muscle and strengthening the heart and lungs.' Done correctly, this will be one of the most potent things you can do for your health - moderate exercise has been shown to lower the risk of heart disease, some cancers and endless day-to-day ailments. Increasingly, however, research is demonstrating how many of our workout habits mean that the health benefits of regular exercise are being overridden by the negative effects - that is, by attempting to be too fit too fast, we don't strengthen our body through exercise, we actually attack it.</p> <p>Problems occur for one of three reasons: we either work out too hard, for too long or too often. Of these, experts believe working too hard is the most damaging. If you work out really hard, all the ways in which your body is supposed to adapt to exercise stress go out of control. Take your immune system - ideally, exercise should stress it into producing more fighting cells, but if you work too hard this doesn't happen. Instead, it stresses it so much that the vital killer cells that are supposed to protect us are actually destroyed and for up to 24 hours any bug in the vicinity can take hold (one reason a third of marathon runners get sick after the race).</p> <p>Outside of the immune system, you'll find that instead of reducing the effects of stress on the body, a high-intensity workout actually increases levels of the most harmful stress hormone, cortisol, causing endless problems for circulation and the nervous system. And while moderate exercise causes your bones to go into a process of recycling - during a normal workout, they are broken down by cells called osteoclasts ready to be mended by so-called osteoblasts afterwards - working out too hard knocks this process out of balance and the amount of bone broken down is increased. Add to this the fact that heavy exercise can cut oestrogen levels in the body, and it's easy to see why new research shows increasing numbers of athletes getting osteoporosis up to 20 years earlier than normal.</p> <p>Another effect of overdoing exercise, is the overproduction of molecules called free radicals which rampage around the body attacking healthy cells. At moderate exercise levels, free radical increase can be fought by your body, but during an intense workout some areas of the body produce as much as 200 times more free radicals than normal, increasing free-radical damage to cells - a process which has been linked to everything from cataracts to cancer.</p> <p>Preventing these problems is relatively easy. You monitor the intensity of your workout and so prevent yourself from working out too hard. 'The idea is to ensure that the majority of your workout is done at around 70 per cent of your maximum heart rate,' says Dr Ian Swaine, principal lecturer in exercise physiology at De Montfort University. 'You work this out by subtracting your age away from 220, then working out 70 per cent of this. This is the number of beats per minute your heart should beat, and it's the level at which you should exercise to maximise the gains made from exercise and minimise the negatives.'</p> <p>This doesn't mean, however, that as long as you keep working out steadily, you can spend hour after hour in the gym. Working out for too long or too many times in a week can also cause problems. Ralph Pffanberg Jr and his team at Stanford University Medical School studied nearly 17,000 men and found that exercisers who burnt between 2,000 and 3,000 calories a week exercising (about three-and-a-half to five hours of moderate running or cycling) had significantly lower death rates from heart disease than non-exercisers. However, when men burnt more than 3,000 calories a week (about four 75-minute sessions), this protective effect began to decline and death rates started to climb again. Similar thresholds have been shown for women. The sensible exerciser, therefore, will aim for the 2,000 to 3,000 calorie mark - about about three-and- a-half to five hours a week, with no session lasting longer than one hour.</p> <p>You should also make sure you rest for a day between sessions. 'Many people think this will lower your fitness level, but that's not true. The gains you make when you work out actually occur in the rest period for 24 hours afterward as your body repairs. It can't do this if you're working out again,' says Professor Mike Gleeson from the School of Exercise Science at the University of Birmingham. If you insist on training every day, Gleeson says, 'you should at least ensure a heavy workout is followed by a light day using different muscle groups.'</p> <p>Of course, if you are training for an endurance event like a marathon, cutting back won't be an option. In this case, your protection comes from your diet. What you do or don't eat can make a huge difference to the effects that exercise can have. Start by supplementing with the antioxidant nutrients that will help fight free-radical damage. Studies at Washington University School of Medicine showed that exercisers given 600iu of vitamin E, 1,000mg of vitamin C and 30mg of beta carotene before they worked out produced 36 per cent fewer free radicals during their workout than normal. 'You can also cut immuno-suppression by ensuring you eat before a workout,' says Professor Gleeson. 'The immune system gets more depressed when people work out on an empty stomach.' He also points out that exercising in extremes of temperature increases the risk of immuno-suppression.</p> <p>Finally, watch your equipment - if it's not up to scratch, you might find that it's not just your immune system you have to worry about. A recent Austrian study showed that 95 per cent of men who mountain-biked about 3,000 miles a year had developed deformities in the scrotum that could lead to fertility problems in the future. It was believed much of the problems were caused by knocks to the testes from bikes with suspension problems and hard saddles. This echoed findings that showed that high-duration cyclists were developing impotency due to damage to the nerve endings in the groin caused through crotch-to-saddle contact.</p> <p>Of more universal concern is the increase in risk of injury to the the knees and back caused by wearing trainers that have lost their suspension. Make sure you replace training shoes every 500 miles of running, or about every 100 hours of any other exercise. If you aren't sure how many miles your footwear has logged, take them to a sports shop, try one new trainer and one old trainer at the same time and run, jump, walk - whatever - just concentrate on how your body feels as it hits the ground. If the new shoe feels dramatically bouncier, you need to buy new shoes.</p> <p>Overall, what's important is to listen to your body and to aim to strengthen and improve it through sensible exercise. Doing so will bring many benefits, ranging from protecting your heart to creating better orgasms.</p> <p>It's also worth bearing in mind that, according to Ian Swaine, 'the benefits of exercise are so powerful that even if you are working too hard you have less risk of major health problems than a couch potato. But for optimum gain, get the balance right.'</p> <p><b> Take a break: work out too hard and you'll pay the price</b></p> <p>Experts recommend that you look out for the following signs - if you are experiencing more than two or three of them then it's time to take a rest .</p> <p>\u0095 Your resting heart rate is 8bpm more than normal. Regular exercisers should get used to knowing their heart rate by taking it first thing in the morning (while still in bed). If it increases by more than 8bpm over a day, your body is trying to tell you something - it could be that you're coming down with a bug, it could be that you're overdoing it. Either way, you need a rest.</p> <p>\u0095 Has your workout got harder? If you're finding it significantly harder to do your normal programme, take it a bit easier.</p> <p>\u0095 How are your POMS? The effects of exercise are not just physical. When looking for overtraining, experts measure something called the Profile of Mood States (POMs). If you find you're getting more depressed, having more mood swings, feeling irritable or experiencing loss of libido, take a break.</p> <p>\u0095 Are you fatigued or having trouble sleeping? Both can be signs of overtraining.</p> <p>\u0095 How's your health? Frequent infections (particularly respiratory infections) are a sign that your immune system is suppressed, which is a sign that you're working too hard. Be sure to take a break and include proper rest periods.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The Christmas issue of Time magazine featured a photograph of Sir Elton John sporting a milk moustache alongside the words 'I'm still standing. Want strong bones?', as part of an advertising campaign to encourage Americans to drink more milk. The timing is apt, for at this time of year snow and ice can render many pavements treacherous, and a slip can be all that it takes to inflict life-threatening injuries on people who suffer from the brittle-bone disease osteoporosis. One in three women and one in 10 men in the UK suffer from this disease, and each year doctors treat 70,000 hip fractures, 50,000 wrist fractures and 40,000 spinal fractures, at a cost of more than \u00a31.5bn a year to the NHS. This shocking expense could be reduced if we paid more attention to our diets, and particularly to our consumption of calcium, the easily absorbed nutrient that is essential for enabling the body to create new, and to preserve old, bone tissue.</p> <p>The childhood and teenage years are the most crucial when it comes to preventing osteoporosis, because this is when we form the strong bones that will support us in later life. The recommended daily intake of calcium is 450mg a day for children up to six years old, rising to 550mg from six to 11 and shooting up to 800mg for girls and 1,000mg for boys thereafter.</p> <p>After the age of 20, when the formation of new bone material ceases, the recommendation decreases to 700-800mg a day for both men and women. Although some children who have a confirmed milk allergy should not consume dairy products, for the majority of children these are a vital component of a healthy diet.</p> <p>It generally makes little difference whether you or your children drink skimmed or the richest Jersey milk, low-fat or whole milk. However, I don't recommend that children under the age of three drink reduced-fat milk because they require fat to supply their bodies with fat-soluble vitamins, although semi-skimmed milk is usually fine after the age of three and skimmed milk after five. Remember that goat's milk contains slightly less fat than cow's milk, while sheep's milk contains a little more.</p> <p>To achieve the recommended intake of calcium, a child could have 500ml of milk, 300g (2 small pots) of yogurt or 75g of cheese a day, while teenagers could have 850ml of milk, 500mg of yogurt or 125g of cheese. To glean 750mg of calcium, an adult would need to consume 650ml of milk, 400g of yogurt or 100g of cheese. You could also top up your calcium intake by eating almonds, spinach, seeds, tofu, canned fish and dried fruits.</p> <p><b> Nutrition news: The zinc link </b></p> <p>Over Christmas, my father brought a piece of recent research to my attention that will probably cause a rumpus in many households. According to a report made to the World Stroke Congress in Melbourne, Australia, having sex three times a week can halve a man's risk of having a heart attack or stroke. Contrary to the conventional belief that cardiovascular exercise should be taken at least three times a week and should last for 20 minutes or longer, according to leading specialist Sahr Ebrahim, it doesn't matter if the sex doesn't last very long - even a three-minute quickie could be good for a man's heart. By way of encouragement, while there is no scientific proof of a specific food's aphrodisiac qualities, most people can conjure up a sexy thought or two while swallowing an oyster, peeling a prawn or sucking an asparagus spear. Coincidentally, or maybe not, the oyster and other seafood is rich in zinc, a nutrient which if deficient can lead to a poor libido. Less sexy but equally zinc-rich foods include brown rice, crumbly cheeses and wholegrain bread.</p> <p><b>Your questions</b></p> <p>I have just been diagnosed as having a wheat intolerance. Does this mean that I can't eat oats, too, as I gather that they're related? <br><b>Martin Glover, Dulwich</b></p> <p>You're right in thinking that oats and wheat are related, as they both contain a protein called gluten, which frequently causes food-intolerance and allergy symptoms. Oats contain far less gluten than wheat, however, as do rye and barley. The first thing to do is to check with the practitioner who diagnosed you whether you have an intolerance to wheat or gluten (the names are often misused). If you are unable to digest gluten, you will have to avoid all of its sources, including many manufactured products, such as cakes, pasta, sausages and foods that contain bread.

      "bodyText": "The Christmas issue of Time magazine featured a photograph of Sir Elton John sporting a milk moustache alongside the words 'I'm still standing. Want strong bones?', as part of an advertising campaign to encourage Americans to drink more milk. The timing is apt, for at this time of year snow and ice can render many pavements treacherous, and a slip can be all that it takes to inflict life-threatening injuries on people who suffer from the brittle-bone disease osteoporosis. One in three women and one in 10 men in the UK suffer from this disease, and each year doctors treat 70,000 hip fractures, 50,000 wrist fractures and 40,000 spinal fractures, at a cost of more than \u00a31.5bn a year to the NHS. This shocking expense could be reduced if we paid more attention to our diets, and particularly to our consumption of calcium, the easily absorbed nutrient that is essential for enabling the body to create new, and to preserve old, bone tissue. The childhood and teenage years are the most crucial when it comes to preventing osteoporosis, because this is when we form the strong bones that will support us in later life. The recommended daily intake of calcium is 450mg a day for children up to six years old, rising to 550mg from six to 11 and shooting up to 800mg for girls and 1,000mg for boys thereafter. After the age of 20, when the formation of new bone material ceases, the recommendation decreases to 700-800mg a day for both men and women. Although some children who have a confirmed milk allergy should not consume dairy products, for the majority of children these are a vital component of a healthy diet. It generally makes little difference whether you or your children drink skimmed or the richest Jersey milk, low-fat or whole milk. However, I don't recommend that children under the age of three drink reduced-fat milk because they require fat to supply their bodies with fat-soluble vitamins, although semi-skimmed milk is usually fine after the age of three and skimmed milk after five. Remember that goat's milk contains slightly less fat than cow's milk, while sheep's milk contains a little more. To achieve the recommended intake of calcium, a child could have 500ml of milk, 300g (2 small pots) of yogurt or 75g of cheese a day, while teenagers could have 850ml of milk, 500mg of yogurt or 125g of cheese. To glean 750mg of calcium, an adult would need to consume 650ml of milk, 400g of yogurt or 100g of cheese. You could also top up your calcium intake by eating almonds, spinach, seeds, tofu, canned fish and dried fruits. Nutrition news: The zinc link Over Christmas, my father brought a piece of recent research to my attention that will probably cause a rumpus in many households. According to a report made to the World Stroke Congress in Melbourne, Australia, having sex three times a week can halve a man's risk of having a heart attack or stroke. Contrary to the conventional belief that cardiovascular exercise should be taken at least three times a week and should last for 20 minutes or longer, according to leading specialist Sahr Ebrahim, it doesn't matter if the sex doesn't last very long - even a three-minute quickie could be good for a man's heart. By way of encouragement, while there is no scientific proof of a specific food's aphrodisiac qualities, most people can conjure up a sexy thought or two while swallowing an oyster, peeling a prawn or sucking an asparagus spear. Coincidentally, or maybe not, the oyster and other seafood is rich in zinc, a nutrient which if deficient can lead to a poor libido. Less sexy but equally zinc-rich foods include brown rice, crumbly cheeses and wholegrain bread. Your questions I have just been diagnosed as having a wheat intolerance. Does this mean that I can't eat oats, too, as I gather that they're related? Martin Glover, Dulwich You're right in thinking that oats and wheat are related, as they both contain a protein called gluten, which frequently causes food-intolerance and allergy symptoms. Oats contain far less gluten than wheat, however, as do rye and barley. The first thing to do is to check with the practitioner who diagnosed you whether you have an intolerance to wheat or gluten (the names are often misused). If you are unable to digest gluten, you will have to avoid all of its sources, including many manufactured products, such as cakes, pasta, sausages and foods that contain bread. Although product labels are required by law to declare the presence of gluten, if in doubt, contact the Coeliac Society (01494 437 278) for a list of products that are gluten-free. People who are sensitive to wheat alone may be able to eat oats, rye and barley. Although some people can tolerate a small amount of wheat, they find that their symptoms persist when they eat more than their guts can deal with. A stressed gut also reacts badly to the food that you're sensitive to, so if you avoid eating wheat-based products during the working week and reserve them for the weekend, for example, your body may be able to tolerate them better. \u0095 Jane Clarke is a state-registered dietician.

      "body": "<p>More than all the Hello! has-beens and OK! nobodies, more than the MTV presenters and society party girls, more than Craig from Big Brother or the 'Green Shield stamp heir' who used to escort Claudia Schiffer, more even than Elizabeth Hurley, Caprice Bourret embodies the late-postmodern age of British celebrity culture. She is not simply famous for being famous. She is famous for being famous for being famous. </p> <p>Her renown has never been anything but knowing. It has always been, right from the instant she entered public consciousness, based on the self-evident absurdity of her being well-known. There was no backlift with the former bra model. No transition from obscurity to celebrity, no awkward limbo of semi-recognition. She arrived, fully formed, as an ironic icon, a camp conceit, a beautiful blonde media monster. </p> <p>And it was not just the tabloids she colonised, like so many third-rate soap stars. She also became part of the lexicon of the up-market press. Last year the New Statesman called her 'the dream girl of the post-literate generation' and the Sunday Telegraph suggested that as a 'parodic celebrity' she was an ideal candidate to join the House of Windsor. </p> <p>The novel question one asks with Caprice (the Bourret, as if to emphasise her status as a phenomenon, was long ago buried) is if she hadn't been invented, would she exist? If the media hadn't made her famous - by constantly asking why she is famous - would anyone, other than her family and friends, have the least idea who she is? </p> <p>Of course, it's one of those imponderable riddles, like whether the light stays on when you close the fridge. It should also be conceded that, by definition, a magazine interview is not the best means by which to solve the puzzle. It's the self-defeating equivalent of opening the fridge door. </p> <p>As it happens, I have already seen inside Caprice's fridge door (I seem to remember it contained a solitary yogurt), thanks to an intriguing documentary called Being Caprice. The programme, screened last year, called upon her to wear a concealed camera for 10 days as she attended parties, sat on the loo, and looked inside her fridge. She agreed to this extraordinary invasion of privacy because, she claimed, 'I think a lot of people have a misconception of Caprice's world.' </p> <p>Perhaps for still more people, any curiosity they begrudgingly nurture for Caprice stems from the fact that she says things like 'people have a misconception of Caprice's world'. Increasingly, the most interesting aspect of celebrities is their celebrity, not what they are celebrated for. As Caprice's job is being a celebrity, being Caprice, she represents the purest form of fame: artifice untainted by art. Thus interviews with Caprice have been a number of things - vapid, silly, an excuse to publish photos of her without her clothes on - but never have they had to concern themselves with the numbing details of what she was actually doing. But now she has gone and spoilt everything by wanting to be a pop star. </p> <p> 'I'm not talking about the modelling,' Caprice said firmly, 'the modelling's in the past. And I'm not talking about my relationships. I'm talking about my music now.' We were sitting on the large comfortable sofa in the faintly showroom atmosphere of her modern, gated-community home in Fulham, when Caprice started to live up to her name. </p> <p>Up until that point, I had been surprised at how well we were getting along. I had expected her to remain in 'character', like Sir Les Patterson or Ali G, and play the role of the hard-nosed bimbo in need of constant attention. But in her civvies of jeans and T-shirt, she was rather sweet and unsophisticated. Almost natural. </p> <p>A great deal of speculation has centred on how much of Caprice is originally her and how much has been improved by medical science. There has been informed talk of nose jobs and breast implants, and one men's magazine editor who has worked with her told me he was convinced that she had received 'a total atomic makeover'. But in the morning, before the make-up artist had got to work at the photo shoot, she appeared persuasively organic. </p> <p>At the shoot, in the vain hope of learning anything about the 'real' Caprice, I spoke to her publicist, a disarmingly boyish character called Ghislain Pascal. He wore a permanent expression of amusement, as if we were all playing a game and he was winning. I'd seen this look of good-humoured cynicism before on other entertainment PRs. It suggests to me that they know precisely how trivial the publicity business is, which is to say not quite as trivial as the journalism that it feeds. </p> <p>He gave me his business card, a mini portfolio of the talent he represents (none of whom I recognised), with his company name in large type on the front: 'Panic'. </p> <p>Pascal has been credited as the architect of Caprice's instantaneous public profile. He met her back in early 1996 at the Select model agency where he was the PR. A graduate of the LSE, and former charity worker, he quickly recognised her determination to become someone. 'I knew that we could work together. She wanted publicity.' </p> <p>His first step was to get her on Daddy's Girls, a documentary about the charmed life of three spoilt, rich young women, including Tamara Beckwith (another of his clients). He then approached WonderBra and landed a promotion campaign, before overseeing Caprice's coup de grace, her arrival at the National Television Awards in a see-through dress. The tabloids, hungry for a new Elizabeth Hurley, went hog-mad. Britain has rarely seemed a smaller country. It was as simple as that. </p> <p>At least that's how Pascal tells it. For Caprice the story is a little more complicated. She resents the 'famous for being famous' tag and wants to let you know how hard she has worked to get where she is. But at the same time, she also doesn't want you to get the impression that any of it has been planned or calculated. And that means she often contradicts herself or retreats behind vague memory or her favourite phrase: 'That's a matter of semantics.' </p> <p>Not long after Daddy's Girl, in which she boasted that she was 'born' to polo fields, it became apparent that she was in fact more of a Valley Girl, who grew up in modest circumstances in a Los Angeles suburb and whose father left home when she was four. </p> <p>The British, she was to learn, can be quite pedantic about social class. She now claims that she thought the programme was an acting job. 'I didn't know it was going to be real,' she told me. 'I just went with the flow.' </p> <p>Even the circumstances in which she originally came to London have been known to change depending on how passive or active she wants to seem at any given time. Back in 1996, she told the Daily Mail that she came to Britain because of her boyfriend at the time, a property developer named Robert Tchenguiz. 'We met when I visited the Monte Carlo Grand Prix. He asked me to visit him in Britain for a weekend. So I did, ended up staying a month, got a flat, joined an agency and, boom, started making a life for myself over here. So that trip changed my life.' </p> <p>Elsewhere she has said that it was Tchenguiz's partner, Robert Curtis, whom she met in Monte Carlo and who invited her to London. But she told me that she came to England to get tear sheets and because she thought she could be 'a bigger fish in a smaller pond'. And the decision, she insisted, had nothing to do with any man. Like she often says: whatever. </p> <p> As I drove her home after the shoot, Caprice changed gear. I don't mean that she slipped into something more comfortable. Nor do I mean that she became more animated. I mean she shifted the car gears while I held the steering wheel. </p> <p>I was conscious at the time of the surreal, not to say comic, quality of coasting through London as a pneumatic blonde celebrity took care of my gear stick. But in retrospect, compared with the forensic analysis of nonsense that was to follow, it was the day's most real moment. </p> <p>It was after we arrived at her house that things turned weird. She told me, for example, that she was 'not in this business for the fame thing'. She told me that she had regrets about posing nude for Playboy but that she was happy to pose nude for magazines like GQ. </p> <p>'There's a difference, Andrew, between showing the whole lot and showing nothing at all by covering up. There's a huge difference. There's one thing pushing the limit, but covering the bits up, and being really explicit and showing everything - at this stage of my career, I don't feel I need to do it, and I won't do it again.' She told me that she was changing her image from naked cover girl to something more 'minimalist'. 'You have to move on, just like Madonna. You've got to evolve.' </p> <p>And so we came to the music, her music. Three years ago, at the height of her fame, she apparently signed a five-album deal with Virgin. I say apparently because only two singles have been produced in that period. Not since the heyday of progressive rock bands has anybody spent so long in the studio working on an album that still remains notional. </p> <p>The delay has been partly caused by an artistic change in direction. The first single, 'Oh Yeah', released two years ago, only charted at number 24. It was deemed to be too poppy. What did she think of it? 'I thought it was a great campaign,' she said, sounding more like a politician than a pop star, 'and I was really happy with the results.' </p> <p>Yes, but what about the song itself? 'At the time, I went with it, but afterwards it wasn't the direction I wanted to go in. And now the album's completely different, guitar led, much more raw.' </p> <p>There was a limit to how much I could discuss her music because her management had seen fit only to send me one single, 'Once Around the Sun'. I suppose it would be described as easy listening, although I found it very hard listening. </p> <p>Such is the abysmal state of British pop music these days, however, that it's not the worst song you'll ever hear. It's not even the worst song you'll hear this month. But it is blandly forgettable. </p> <p>The transition from model to pop singer, while not as common as model-to-actress, has been attempted before. Naomi Campbell, the supermodel and novelist, had a go but, if anything, made more of a mark with her ghosted writing. Caprice dislikes the comparison. </p> <p>Various attempts to carve out a TV career had come to nothing, when she discovered her passion for pop. Again, she didn't have the idea herself. A boyfriend suggested that she should make a record. Having never sung outside the shower, she says she was shocked. 'I swear I thought he was on drugs or something. \"Are you out of your mind?\" I said, but he kept persisting. I thought, \"What have I got to lose?\"' </p> <p>She wouldn't tell me who the boyfriend was. She has an odd habit of bringing attention to her male friends and then coming over coy if you ask her about them. Last year the revelation that she had been to dinner with Prince Andrew gained a depressingly extensive amount of press coverage. Some reports identified Pascal as the source of the story. He denied it when I asked him, but he couldn't control his widening smile. </p> <p>Caprice herself has also employed this strategy of implausible deniability. On TV in America, promoting her Playboy cover, she replied when asked about Andrew: 'Even if I have kissed him, do you think I'd tell you?' </p> <p>She confided afterwards, in Being Caprice , about being questioned on Andrew: 'I wouldn't mind the attention if I had a record out.' </p> <p>In London, she said to me: 'You know when it's bad is when you're promoting a record and all they want to talk about is you going out with Prince Andrew, do you know what I mean?' </p> <p>Well, frankly, no. The stop-start publicity cycle of statement, denial, then counter-denial was beginning to exhaust and disorientate me. I asked her if she felt pop music was all part of the same continuum as modelling. </p> <p>'No, no, no, because I was a product then. I was whatever the client wanted me to be.' </p> <p>Did that include turning out to parties? </p> <p>'Oh yeah, I made a lot of money showing up at parties. I would turn up in a very glamorous outfit. And that's it. That's it. I made a great living.' </p> <p>How much would you be paid? </p> <p>'I'm not going to tell you.' </p> <p>Oh, come on. </p> <p>'I'm not going to tell you.' </p> <p>Why not? </p> <p>'Because it's none of your business.' </p> <p>I'll tell you how much I'm paid. </p> <p>'No, I don't want to know. I was able to save a substantial amount of money and that's it.' </p> <p>I love it when you come over prim, I said, in an effort dissipate the tension. </p> <p>'I'm not going to tell you, you little shit. I'm not going to tell you. Don't bug me about it. I was really, really lucky, I was able to make a good living. And that's what it was all about, you know. People like glamorous people and that's what they hired me to be, the glamorous Caprice they saw on the cover of magazines.' </p> <p>So no continuum between modelling and pop music, then? </p> <p>'What happened,' she said, attempting to regain her composure, 'was I'm a very creative person by nature and,' she paused, as she searched for the right words, 'I didn't want to model.' </p> <p>I tried to get back to the safer territory of music by asking her why she recorded the (still to be completed) album in Los Angeles. </p> <p>'I was in LA so I was isolated and I couldn't go off and do a TV show or a modelling job, or be tempted, because they used to tempt me. They used to call me up and say, \"You're going to make this much\" and I'd go, \"Oh!\"' </p> <p>How much? </p> <p>'You little shit, I'm not going to tell you.' </p> <p>I was asking about modelling money, not the appearance money. </p> <p>'It's the same thing. I'm not going to tell you.' </p> <p>It's a different question. </p> <p>'It's the same thing, they're both jobs and I'm not going to tell you.' </p> <p>But everyone knows that Linda Evangelista wouldn't get out of bed for less than $10,000. What kind of money wouldn't you get out of bed for? Let's say I phoned you up and said, 'Look, there's a couple of hundred quid in this, could be 300 if it all works out.' What would you have said? No? </p> <p>There was a withering silence and then she said: 'Not necessarily. When you do a cover, that could be \u00a3150.' </p> <p>That seemed to be as good a time as any to mention Tony Adams, the footballer. Through some kind of publicity osmosis, I had absorbed the news that they had been an item, but I think I assumed it was one of those urban-myth romances, like the lesbian folk singer and the famous children's TV presenter. Caprice has been 'linked' with countless men, among them Rod Stewart, Matthew McConaughey and, the week I met her, Dennis Quaid. But it turned out that Adams had really been a boyfriend. </p> <p>In Being Caprice she put the record straight. 'I did have a relationship with him over a year ago. My publicist has already made a statement for me. I'll just say: \"No comment.\"' To be a star, I suppose you have to act like one. </p> <p>You and Tony Adams, I said, that was an incongruous relationship. There's Tony, England football captain and powerhouse of the Arsenal defence, and you, model, superstar. 'You know, at the end of the day, Andrew, put aside all the bullshit, all the England captain and model - it's about two people who have a connection, an understanding, a communication.' </p> <p>At the end of our day, I think I found Caprice a slightly nicer and less neurotic person than the image I'd subconsciously formed from the ubiquity of her image. Yet I couldn't imagine someone with whom it would be more difficult to forge any lasting kind of connection, understanding or genuine communication. </p> <p>For a start, you wouldn't know what to put on her birthday card. She told me that her birthday was 24 October 1972. Others have placed it much earlier than that, though I doubt it, and the same date in 1971 has also featured heavily as the real day. I asked her why there was a debate. </p> <p>'That was initially because... I don't know why, there hasn't been a debate for the last three years.' </p> <p>But why was there a debate then? </p> <p>'I don't know. I don't know. I just don't remember.' </p> <p>That's how the interview ended: with Caprice's mystery undiminished but her publicity unquestionably increased. The next day she was flying to the Bahamas, to a special celebrity-only party on Sol Kirschner's Paradise Island. After all, she's famous.</p>",

For Caprice the story is a little more complicated. She resents the 'famous for being famous' tag and wants to let you know how hard she has worked to get where she is. But at the same time, she also doesn't want you to get the impression that any of it has been planned or calculated. And that means she often contradicts herself or retreats behind vague memory or her favourite phrase: 'That's a matter of semantics.' Not long after Daddy's Girl, in which she boasted that she was 'born' to polo fields, it became apparent that she was in fact more of a Valley Girl, who grew up in modest circumstances in a Los Angeles suburb and whose father left home when she was four. The British, she was to learn, can be quite pedantic about social class. She now claims that she thought the programme was an acting job. 'I didn't know it was going to be real,' she told me. 'I just went with the flow.' Even the circumstances in which she originally came to London have been known to change depending on how passive or active she wants to seem at any given time. Back in 1996, she told the Daily Mail that she came to Britain because of her boyfriend at the time, a property developer named Robert Tchenguiz. 'We met when I visited the Monte Carlo Grand Prix. He asked me to visit him in Britain for a weekend. So I did, ended up staying a month, got a flat, joined an agency and, boom, started making a life for myself over here. So that trip changed my life.' Elsewhere she has said that it was Tchenguiz's partner, Robert Curtis, whom she met in Monte Carlo and who invited her to London. But she told me that she came to England to get tear sheets and because she thought she could be 'a bigger fish in a smaller pond'. And the decision, she insisted, had nothing to do with any man. Like she often says: whatever. As I drove her home after the shoot, Caprice changed gear. I don't mean that she slipped into something more comfortable. Nor do I mean that she became more animated. I mean she shifted the car gears while I held the steering wheel. I was conscious at the time of the surreal, not to say comic, quality of coasting through London as a pneumatic blonde celebrity took care of my gear stick. But in retrospect, compared with the forensic analysis of nonsense that was to follow, it was the day's most real moment. It was after we arrived at her house that things turned weird. She told me, for example, that she was 'not in this business for the fame thing'. She told me that she had regrets about posing nude for Playboy but that she was happy to pose nude for magazines like GQ. 'There's a difference, Andrew, between showing the whole lot and showing nothing at all by covering up. There's a huge difference. There's one thing pushing the limit, but covering the bits up, and being really explicit and showing everything - at this stage of my career, I don't feel I need to do it, and I won't do it again.' She told me that she was changing her image from naked cover girl to something more 'minimalist'. 'You have to move on, just like Madonna. You've got to evolve.' And so we came to the music, her music. Three years ago, at the height of her fame, she apparently signed a five-album deal with Virgin. I say apparently because only two singles have been produced in that period. Not since the heyday of progressive rock bands has anybody spent so long in the studio working on an album that still remains notional. The delay has been partly caused by an artistic change in direction. The first single, 'Oh Yeah', released two years ago, only charted at number 24. It was deemed to be too poppy. What did she think of it? 'I thought it was a great campaign,' she said, sounding more like a politician than a pop star, 'and I was really happy with the results.' Yes, but what about the song itself? 'At the time, I went with it, but afterwards it wasn't the direction I wanted to go in. And now the album's completely different, guitar led, much more raw.' There was a limit to how much I could discuss her music because her management had seen fit only to send me one single, 'Once Around the Sun'. I suppose it would be described as easy listening, although I found it very hard listening. Such is the abysmal state of British pop music these days, however, that it's not the worst song you'll ever hear. It's not even the worst song you'll hear this month. But it is blandly forgettable. The transition from model to pop singer, while not as common as model-to-actress, has been attempted before. Naomi Campbell, the supermodel and novelist, had a go but, if anything, made more of a mark with her ghosted writing. Caprice dislikes the comparison. Various attempts to carve out a TV career had come to nothing, when she discovered her passion for pop. Again, she didn't have the idea herself. A boyfriend suggested that she should make a record. Having never sung outside the shower, she says she was shocked. 'I swear I thought he was on drugs or something. \"Are you out of your mind?\" I said, but he kept persisting. I thought, \"What have I got to lose?\"' She wouldn't tell me who the boyfriend was. She has an odd habit of bringing attention to her male friends and then coming over coy if you ask her about them. Last year the revelation that she had been to dinner with Prince Andrew gained a depressingly extensive amount of press coverage. Some reports identified Pascal as the source of the story. He denied it when I asked him, but he couldn't control his widening smile. Caprice herself has also employed this strategy of implausible deniability. On TV in America, promoting her Playboy cover, she replied when asked about Andrew: 'Even if I have kissed him, do you think I'd tell you?' She confided afterwards, in Being Caprice , about being questioned on Andrew: 'I wouldn't mind the attention if I had a record out.' In London, she said to me: 'You know when it's bad is when you're promoting a record and all they want to talk about is you going out with Prince Andrew, do you know what I mean?' Well, frankly, no. The stop-start publicity cycle of statement, denial, then counter-denial was beginning to exhaust and disorientate me. I asked her if she felt pop music was all part of the same continuum as modelling. 'No, no, no, because I was a product then. I was whatever the client wanted me to be.' Did that include turning out to parties? 'Oh yeah, I made a lot of money showing up at parties. I would turn up in a very glamorous outfit. And that's it. That's it. I made a great living.' How much would you be paid? 'I'm not going to tell you.' Oh, come on. 'I'm not going to tell you.' Why not? 'Because it's none of your business.' I'll tell you how much I'm paid. 'No, I don't want to know. I was able to save a substantial amount of money and that's it.' I love it when you come over prim, I said, in an effort dissipate the tension. 'I'm not going to tell you, you little shit. I'm not going to tell you. Don't bug me about it. I was really, really lucky, I was able to make a good living. And that's what it was all about, you know. People like glamorous people and that's what they hired me to be, the glamorous Caprice they saw on the cover of magazines.' So no continuum between modelling and pop music, then? 'What happened,' she said, attempting to regain her composure, 'was I'm a very creative person by nature and,' she paused, as she searched for the right words, 'I didn't want to model.' I tried to get back to the safer territory of music by asking her why she recorded the (still to be completed) album in Los Angeles. 'I was in LA so I was isolated and I couldn't go off and do a TV show or a modelling job, or be tempted, because they used to tempt me. They used to call me up and say, \"You're going to make this much\" and I'd go, \"Oh!\"' How much? 'You little shit, I'm not going to tell you.' I was asking about modelling money, not the appearance money. 'It's the same thing. I'm not going to tell you.' It's a different question. 'It's the same thing, they're both jobs and I'm not going to tell you.' But everyone knows that Linda Evangelista wouldn't get out of bed for less than $10,000. What kind of money wouldn't you get out of bed for? Let's say I phoned you up and said, 'Look, there's a couple of hundred quid in this, could be 300 if it all works out.' What would you have said? No? There was a withering silence and then she said: 'Not necessarily. When you do a cover, that could be \u00a3150.' That seemed to be as good a time as any to mention Tony Adams, the footballer. Through some kind of publicity osmosis, I had absorbed the news that they had been an item, but I think I assumed it was one of those urban-myth romances, like the lesbian folk singer and the famous children's TV presenter. Caprice has been 'linked' with countless men, among them Rod Stewart, Matthew McConaughey and, the week I met her, Dennis Quaid. But it turned out that Adams had really been a boyfriend. In Being Caprice she put the record straight. 'I did have a relationship with him over a year ago. My publicist has already made a statement for me. I'll just say: \"No comment.\"' To be a star, I suppose you have to act like one. You and Tony Adams, I said, that was an incongruous relationship. There's Tony, England football captain and powerhouse of the Arsenal defence, and you, model, superstar. 'You know, at the end of the day, Andrew, put aside all the bullshit, all the England captain and model - it's about two people who have a connection, an understanding, a communication.' At the end of our day, I think I found Caprice a slightly nicer and less neurotic person than the image I'd subconsciously formed from the ubiquity of her image. Yet I couldn't imagine someone with whom it would be more difficult to forge any lasting kind of connection, understanding or genuine communication. For a start, you wouldn't know what to put on her birthday card. She told me that her birthday was 24 October 1972. Others have placed it much earlier than that, though I doubt it, and the same date in 1971 has also featured heavily as the real day. I asked her why there was a debate. 'That was initially because... I don't know why, there hasn't been a debate for the last three years.' But why was there a debate then? 'I don't know. I don't know. I just don't remember.' That's how the interview ended: with Caprice's mystery undiminished but her publicity unquestionably increased. The next day she was flying to the Bahamas, to a special celebrity-only party on Sol Kirschner's Paradise Island. After all, she's famous.",

      "body": "<p>In 1986, high in the Hollywood hills, with the Los Angeles basin extending south as far as the eye could see, the city winked like some magic jewelled carpet before me, and Joel Silver promised that I could have it all. Joel had a round, oversized face, piercing eyes, and a full black beard. He was in his thirties and had just produced the fabulously successful 48 Hrs ; Lethal Weapon and Die Hard were just ahead.</p> <p>'So?' he asked, grinning. 'Whaddaya think, babe?'</p> <p>Joel was an art collector, and we were standing before his major acquisition - one not even I could ever hope to match for him. Storer House, named after its first owner, is the most spectacular of several poured- concrete residences Frank Lloyd Wright designed and built in Los Angeles in the 1920s. Climbing by terraced stages into the hillside near the summit of Holly- wood Boulevard, it resembles some great pharaoh's tomb, with falling water inside and out, a Wright trademark, and stunning Japanese gardens. Joel had restored it and brought the familiar Wright details to life. There were ponds stocked with koi, exotic palms, lava-rock fireplaces in the upstairs and downstairs living rooms, and halogen spots on dimmers mounted in the polished, wood-beamed ceilings.</p> <p>But the rooms were sparsely furnished, and the walls were almost bare. This was where I came in.</p> <p>'Over there,' Joel said excitedly as he led me through the downstairs rooms.</p> <p>'That's where I want your Ali Baba vase. And the Goddess of Mars . That sculpture? I want it right here. It'll knock their socks off when they come in the door. And the Versey carpet here.'</p> <p>'The Voysey,' I corrected him.</p> <p>'Yeah,' he snapped, 'whatever you call it. And the Flying Saucer lamp, I want that. And I want a Whistler.'</p> <p>'It'll cost you an arm and a leg,' I told him.</p> <p>He stared at me for a second. 'Then I'll settle for an Inness.'</p> <p>Despite his greed and his need for instant gratification, Joel knew, in a general sense, what would work in his magnificent hilltop aerie. But he needed someone to get it for him, someone with expertise, credentials, and creative flair. He needed his Art Guy, just like the Car Guy and the Garden Guy and the Pool Guy, and the legions of lawyers, managers, accountants, decorators, shrinks and plastic surgeons who cater to the Hollywood elite.</p> <p>For the past 15 years, I had immersed myself in early-20th-century American art. My gallery in Soho had rediscovered and had championed the work of a whole generation of American artists and artisans: the paintings of Georges Inness and William Merritt Chase, the Mission furniture of Gustav Stickley, Rookwood ceramics, the glass and lamps of Louis Comfort Tiffany. It would have taken Joel years to find and assemble the treasure I'd already unearthed, and it would have cost him 10 times as much. But Hollywood people don't work in years - they want it now - and from the moment, just a few weeks before, when Joel swaggered into my gallery, he had found what he was looking for.</p> <p>He called me not long after that first visit. He was interested in a number of pieces he'd seen.</p> <p>'Do you want me to send you transparencies?' I asked him.</p> <p>'Sure, send me everything,' he said. 'But I want you to come out here. We gotta talk.'</p> <p>I was on virtually the next plane. I'd always been star struck, and the success and celebrity I'd enjoyed on the New York art scene had done nothing to diminish that. Jack Nicholson and Anjelica Huston strolled into my gallery earlier that year. Once I'd composed myself, we got talking, and I found out just how knowledgeable a collector Nicholson was. Eventually we became friends, when he started asking for my advice on auctions. The phone would ring at one or two in the morning, and it would be Jack out in California.</p> <p>'Come on, Babycakes, you got the catalogue?' Jack would be thumbing through the catalogue for an upcoming Sotheby's auction the way most of us thumb through a clothing catalogue, poised to order. 'Go to Lot 24. What do you think of that hanging chandelier? What about 113, Tod? The painting? What do you think of that painting?' And on to the carpets and the Tiffany lamps. When I pointed out to Jack that if we got everything he liked and asked me to bid on for him, we'd be spending four or five hundred grand, he'd pause - I could hear the sly grin forming 2,500 miles away - and then he'd say, 'So?'</p> <p>Nicholson's two-letter word evoked an entire way of being in the world for me. To have so much money and power that you didn't have to worry about the cost. That night with Joel in the Frank Lloyd Wright house, with the Valley at my feet, I saw everything I'd ever wanted was within my grasp.</p> <p>'What do you want?' Joel asked me.</p> <p>'I want to change my life,' I told him.</p> <p>'Tell me your dream.'</p> <p>'I want to make movies,' I said. 'I want to make a fortune and marry a movie star.'</p> <p>I may have said it cavalierly, mellowed as I was by champagne, but it was in Joel's own interest to take me seriously.</p> <p>'You can have it all,' he said. 'Listen to me. Here's the deal.'</p> <p>We talked late into the evening. How much of the deal Joel had worked out ahead of time and how much he improvised that night I never knew, but the gist of it was this: I was to furnish Storer House with all the pieces Joel had already singled out from the gallery and others that I would find and buy for him, at minimal profit. In return, I would move my operation west, where Joel would open all the doors for me. 'I know them all, all these people with all this fucking money and no style. They live in these big, empty houses. That's where you come in, babe. You're gonna fill their mansions with all your shit! You're gonna make your fortune and marry your movie star!'</p> <p>The only problem, a minor detail really, was that he didn't have the money to pay the hundreds of thousands of dollars for the pieces he had already earmarked. Sure, he was well paid at the time, but he was still a hired hand, and restoring the house had cleaned him out.</p> <p>What he wanted was to make a down payment and pay off the balance over time. Shrewd as he was, Joel must have known I'd have done it for nothing down.</p> <p>'Sell art,' he sang, 'make movies! It's all gonna happen!'</p> <p>At 37, I was about to reinvent myself. And eventually I would lose everything I had, including my freedom.</p> <p>It was late 1986 when I moved west, and Joel Silver, true to his word, opened doors for me: producers and executives like Larry Gordon, Terry and Jane Semel, Nancy and Bob Daly, Linda and Jerry Bruckheimer, Patsy and Steve Tisch; stars like Penny Marshall, Bruce Willis and Barbra Streisand. I became art guru to Hollywood's elite, and they didn't simply collect, they accumulated competitively.</p> <p>Linda and Jerry Bruckheimer (partner of the infamous Don Simpson, with whom he coproduced a number of films, like Beverly Hills Cop and The Rock ) lived in a steel-and-glass fortress in Brentwood. Linda, a native Kentuckian who favoured leather skirts and stiletto heels, was Jerry's live-in girlfriend for years before they married in 1993. As soon as she learned that others were buying from me - particularly Patsy Tisch - Linda became an important, and demanding, customer. She even grilled me about some pieces she'd heard I'd brought to Tisch.</p> <p>'What about that Fulper mushroom lamp?' she said. 'You promised you'd show it to me first.'</p> <p>'I'm sorry,' I confessed. 'It's already spoken for.'</p> <p>She was silent.</p> <p>'I've got a drop-dead Teco piece coming in about a week.' I said, trying to appease her. Teco was the Chicago architectural ceramic Frank Lloyd Wright often used.</p> <p>'I want it,' Linda said. 'I want you to promise - I want you to swear! - that you'll show it to me before her.'</p> <p>I swore to it.</p> <p>'She's insanely jealous of me, 'Linda added. 'She's never forgiven me for getting to Don before she did.'</p> <p>'Don' was Don Umemoto, an architect catering to the same clientele I was wooing, who'd helped Patsy redesign her home in Pacific Palisades. Although a modernised, somewhat bastard version of the Prairie School, the house had style and space - and absolutely ravishing gardens. It also had Patsy, a beautiful blonde with a keen sense of style and an effortless sexuality that made her seem the quintessential trophy wife. I could see why she rattled other women. Having been raised in New England and having worked at Knoll International for a time, she was also smart, well educated, and enormously charming. We became friends of a sort. I remember asking her once, offhandedly, if she was happy.</p> <p>'As happy as anyone can be in a place like this,' she said.</p> <p>Steve was from the younger generation of the Tisch family, which, among other assets, controlled the Loews Corporation, with its large entertainment and real estate holdings. Steve's success at the time rested on the movie that had launched Tom Cruise, Risky Business .</p> <p>Like many of Hollywood's wives whose husbands live for their work, Patsy was always looking for projects to fill her time. First there was the house; decorating it was next. As I did for most of my favoured customers, I often brought her objects I thought 'belonged' and simply left them there for a while, without immediately talking price. Usually, Patsy would buy one or two things, and I would take the rest away. More than once I'd heard the Tisches argue about one of Patsy's intended purchases.</p> <p>'Do we really need another green vase?'</p> <p>'Yes, Steve, we do.'</p> <p>'How come?'</p> <p>'Because I want it, that's how come.'</p> <p>And Steve would wind up writing the check for 10 or 20 or 30 thousand dollars. It was what Hollywood husbands did to guarantee a truce with their wives.</p> <p>But one day I brought Patsy a Tiffany dogwood lamp, a monumental Grueby vase, and a great Teco, and carried them through the house, placing them where I thought they looked best. A week or so later, I called, assuming that, as usual, she would keep only one of the three.</p> <p>'I want them all,' she said.</p> <p>'All of them? But what about Steve? They're expensive.'</p> <p>I told Patsy the numbers.</p> <p>'Don't worry about Steve,' she answered levelly. 'I'll handle him.'</p> <p>She asked me to come over that afternoon. Patsy looked stunning as always, and we sat in her living room, chatting. It was a Sunday, and Steve, when he showed up, said something about wanting to catch a game on TV.</p> <p>But when he saw me he stopped.</p> <p>'You again,' he groaned. 'I'd better get the chequebook.'</p> <p>'But don't you at least want to see what we're buying?' Patsy asked. 'They're very beautiful.'</p> <p>'How much this time?' he asked. He was still looking at me. 'What do I owe you, Tod?'</p> <p>It was Patsy who answered. 'Seventy thousand.'</p> <p>Steve recoiled as though he'd been struck by a branding iron. 'You know I don't have that kind of money!'</p> <p>Patsy had got his attention.</p> <p>'Oh, come on, Steve,' she said. 'Who are you kidding?'</p> <p>'Well, for Christ's sake, not in the cheque account!' he said. 'I don't have that kind of money in the cheque account!'</p> <p>'Well then, get it,' Patsy's voice was full of scorn. 'Just get it.'</p> <p>There was a moment of dead silence as they stared at each other across the room. Then Steve sat and took out his chequebook, signed the cheque, crumpled it, and tossed it to me.</p> <p>'See ya, Tod,' he said.</p> <p>Then he stormed out of the house. I slipped out a few minutes later, wishing I hadn't seen what I had. I'd been half in love with Patsy myself, but I'd just seen a side of her that made me feel oddly sympathetic toward Steve Tisch. I never saw them together again, but I did see this same story played out countless times in different homes. It was as though once the Hollywood rich built their mansions and filled them, there was nothing left for them to do but get divorced. A few years later, that's what happened to the Tisches. Patsy, I heard later, remarried. Steve secured his place in Hollywood when he attached his name to Forrest Gump .</p> <p>I'd first run into Barbra Streisand at a country auction in New Jersey. She'd just begun to collect turn-of-the-century American art and, characteristically, she did so with a vengeance. Once I moved to California, I continued to bring her furniture and paintings for her Beverly Hills mansion. Frequently she called for advice when she was just about to buy something or had already bought it and was panicking that she had been taken. Early one evening, when I was back in New York, she called.</p> <p>'I'm on my way to the Armory,' she said. The Winter Antiques Show is a major annual event held at the Seventh Regiment Armory on Park Avenue and 67th Street. 'I'll call you later. I want you to come over tonight and look at some things I'm buying. I'll have the housekeeper fix us dinner,' she said.</p> <p>It'll be just the two of us, I thought.</p> <p>'Bring along something wonderful to whet my appetite.'</p> <p>This was a first. I'd never been invited to Barbra's apartment alone, and certainly not for dinner.</p> <p>It was almost 11pm when she called back to say she was just leaving the show. By this time my imagination had run amok. Who knew what could happen? Hadn't her hairdresser and sometime boyfriend, Jon Peters, become, at least for a time, an immensely powerful Hollywood producer?</p> <p>I rang the bell at Barbra's Central Park West duplex a little after 11. The housekeeper let me in - Ms Streisand wasn't home yet - and ushered me into a sitting room furnished with big puffy sinking couches and little tables. There were photographs of Barbra, Elliott Gould (her first husband), her son and other members of her family. A little later, I heard the front door open, then slam shut, and the sound of things being moved around. Then Barbra swept in and kissed me on both cheeks, her face still cold from the night air.</p> <p>'How good it is to have you here,' she said. 'We'll eat in a minute. Let's just chat for a while.'</p> <p>She loved the three vases I'd brought. I have no idea what else we talked about, but I remember the intimacy and the soft timbre of her voice.</p> <p>'Hungry?' she asked.</p> <p>'Starving,' I admitted, smiling.</p> <p>'Well, come on then,' she said gaily. 'Let's eat.' She led me back out through the entrance hall to the dining room. There were shopping bags she must have brought home from the Armory Show, and two chairs. I recognised them instantly. They were a matching pair of tall, spindle-back Frank Lloyd Wright side chairs. They were in perfect condition. But I recognised something else as I handled them: the unmistakable odour of varnish. They'd been refinished, and recently.</p> <p>How much had she paid? I was afraid to ask. If they'd been redone, their value had dropped through the floor.</p> <p>'What do you think, Tod?'</p> <p>I wanted to tell her the truth, but who wants to tell the truth to Barbra Streisand when she's been crossed? Then, as I hesitated, she told me who'd sold them to her and what she'd paid.</p> <p>'They're wonderful!' I said. 'Absolutely magnificent! Congratulations Barbra.'</p> <p>I hated myself for saying this, but I knew the dealer who'd sold her the Wright chairs. We worked together all the time. If I'd told Barbra the truth, she'd have demanded her money back publicly. No one in the art world willingly refunds customers, so the dealer would certainly have wanted to know why she wanted her money back now. Barbra would have named me, the dealers would have denied it, and we would have found ourselves in an embarrassing scandal.</p> <p>She was delighted by my approval.</p> <p>Maybe my lie was why the night went sour so quickly. A question of karma, or self-delusion. The minute we finished dinner Barbra started to yawn. She glanced at her watch, then at the front door. My time with Ms Streisand was clearly up. Once I'd approved the chairs, I was superfluous.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/life/story/0,6903,425818,00.html\" target=\"_NEW\">Read the second part of 'Going, going, gone!' here</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "In 1986, high in the Hollywood hills, with the Los Angeles basin extending south as far as the eye could see, the city winked like some magic jewelled carpet before me, and Joel Silver promised that I could have it all. Joel had a round, oversized face, piercing eyes, and a full black beard. He was in his thirties and had just produced the fabulously successful 48 Hrs ; Lethal Weapon and Die Hard were just ahead. 'So?' he asked, grinning. 'Whaddaya think, babe?' Joel was an art collector, and we were standing before his major acquisition - one not even I could ever hope to match for him. Storer House, named after its first owner, is the most spectacular of several poured- concrete residences Frank Lloyd Wright designed and built in Los Angeles in the 1920s. Climbing by terraced stages into the hillside near the summit of Holly- wood Boulevard, it resembles some great pharaoh's tomb, with falling water inside and out, a Wright trademark, and stunning Japanese gardens. Joel had restored it and brought the familiar Wright details to life. There were ponds stocked with koi, exotic palms, lava-rock fireplaces in the upstairs and downstairs living rooms, and halogen spots on dimmers mounted in the polished, wood-beamed ceilings. But the rooms were sparsely furnished, and the walls were almost bare. This was where I came in. 'Over there,' Joel said excitedly as he led me through the downstairs rooms. 'That's where I want your Ali Baba vase. And the Goddess of Mars . That sculpture? I want it right here. It'll knock their socks off when they come in the door. And the Versey carpet here.' 'The Voysey,' I corrected him. 'Yeah,' he snapped, 'whatever you call it. And the Flying Saucer lamp, I want that. And I want a Whistler.' 'It'll cost you an arm and a leg,' I told him. He stared at me for a second. 'Then I'll settle for an Inness.' Despite his greed and his need for instant gratification, Joel knew, in a general sense, what would work in his magnificent hilltop aerie. But he needed someone to get it for him, someone with expertise, credentials, and creative flair. He needed his Art Guy, just like the Car Guy and the Garden Guy and the Pool Guy, and the legions of lawyers, managers, accountants, decorators, shrinks and plastic surgeons who cater to the Hollywood elite. For the past 15 years, I had immersed myself in early-20th-century American art. My gallery in Soho had rediscovered and had championed the work of a whole generation of American artists and artisans: the paintings of Georges Inness and William Merritt Chase, the Mission furniture of Gustav Stickley, Rookwood ceramics, the glass and lamps of Louis Comfort Tiffany. It would have taken Joel years to find and assemble the treasure I'd already unearthed, and it would have cost him 10 times as much. But Hollywood people don't work in years - they want it now - and from the moment, just a few weeks before, when Joel swaggered into my gallery, he had found what he was looking for. He called me not long after that first visit. He was interested in a number of pieces he'd seen. 'Do you want me to send you transparencies?' I asked him. 'Sure, send me everything,' he said. 'But I want you to come out here. We gotta talk.' I was on virtually the next plane. I'd always been star struck, and the success and celebrity I'd enjoyed on the New York art scene had done nothing to diminish that. Jack Nicholson and Anjelica Huston strolled into my gallery earlier that year. Once I'd composed myself, we got talking, and I found out just how knowledgeable a collector Nicholson was. Eventually we became friends, when he started asking for my advice on auctions. The phone would ring at one or two in the morning, and it would be Jack out in California. 'Come on, Babycakes, you got the catalogue?' Jack would be thumbing through the catalogue for an upcoming Sotheby's auction the way most of us thumb through a clothing catalogue, poised to order. 'Go to Lot 24. What do you think of that hanging chandelier? What about 113, Tod? The painting? What do you think of that painting?' And on to the carpets and the Tiffany lamps. When I pointed out to Jack that if we got everything he liked and asked me to bid on for him, we'd be spending four or five hundred grand, he'd pause - I could hear the sly grin forming 2,500 miles away - and then he'd say, 'So?' Nicholson's two-letter word evoked an entire way of being in the world for me. To have so much money and power that you didn't have to worry about the cost. That night with Joel in the Frank Lloyd Wright house, with the Valley at my feet, I saw everything I'd ever wanted was within my grasp. 'What do you want?' Joel asked me. 'I want to change my life,' I told him. 'Tell me your dream.' 'I want to make movies,' I said. 'I want to make a fortune and marry a movie star.' I may have said it cavalierly, mellowed as I was by champagne, but it was in Joel's own interest to take me seriously. 'You can have it all,' he said. 'Listen to me. Here's the deal.' We talked late into the evening. How much of the deal Joel had worked out ahead of time and how much he improvised that night I never knew, but the gist of it was this: I was to furnish Storer House with all the pieces Joel had already singled out from the gallery and others that I would find and buy for him, at minimal profit. In return, I would move my operation west, where Joel would open all the doors for me. 'I know them all, all these people with all this fucking money and no style. They live in these big, empty houses. That's where you come in, babe. You're gonna fill their mansions with all your shit! You're gonna make your fortune and marry your movie star!' The only problem, a minor detail really, was that he didn't have the money to pay the hundreds of thousands of dollars for the pieces he had already earmarked. Sure, he was well paid at the time, but he was still a hired hand, and restoring the house had cleaned him out. What he wanted was to make a down payment and pay off the balance over time. Shrewd as he was, Joel must have known I'd have done it for nothing down. 'Sell art,' he sang, 'make movies! It's all gonna happen!' At 37, I was about to reinvent myself. And eventually I would lose everything I had, including my freedom. It was late 1986 when I moved west, and Joel Silver, true to his word, opened doors for me: producers and executives like Larry Gordon, Terry and Jane Semel, Nancy and Bob Daly, Linda and Jerry Bruckheimer, Patsy and Steve Tisch; stars like Penny Marshall, Bruce Willis and Barbra Streisand. I became art guru to Hollywood's elite, and they didn't simply collect, they accumulated competitively. Linda and Jerry Bruckheimer (partner of the infamous Don Simpson, with whom he coproduced a number of films, like Beverly Hills Cop and The Rock ) lived in a steel-and-glass fortress in Brentwood. Linda, a native Kentuckian who favoured leather skirts and stiletto heels, was Jerry's live-in girlfriend for years before they married in 1993. As soon as she learned that others were buying from me - particularly Patsy Tisch - Linda became an important, and demanding, customer. She even grilled me about some pieces she'd heard I'd brought to Tisch. 'What about that Fulper mushroom lamp?' she said. 'You promised you'd show it to me first.' 'I'm sorry,' I confessed. 'It's already spoken for.' She was silent. 'I've got a drop-dead Teco piece coming in about a week.' I said, trying to appease her. Teco was the Chicago architectural ceramic Frank Lloyd Wright often used. 'I want it,' Linda said. 'I want you to promise - I want you to swear! - that you'll show it to me before her.' I swore to it. 'She's insanely jealous of me, 'Linda added. 'She's never forgiven me for getting to Don before she did.' 'Don' was Don Umemoto, an architect catering to the same clientele I was wooing, who'd helped Patsy redesign her home in Pacific Palisades. Although a modernised, somewhat bastard version of the Prairie School, the house had style and space - and absolutely ravishing gardens. It also had Patsy, a beautiful blonde with a keen sense of style and an effortless sexuality that made her seem the quintessential trophy wife. I could see why she rattled other women. Having been raised in New England and having worked at Knoll International for a time, she was also smart, well educated, and enormously charming. We became friends of a sort. I remember asking her once, offhandedly, if she was happy. 'As happy as anyone can be in a place like this,' she said. Steve was from the younger generation of the Tisch family, which, among other assets, controlled the Loews Corporation, with its large entertainment and real estate holdings. Steve's success at the time rested on the movie that had launched Tom Cruise, Risky Business . Like many of Hollywood's wives whose husbands live for their work, Patsy was always looking for projects to fill her time. First there was the house; decorating it was next. As I did for most of my favoured customers, I often brought her objects I thought 'belonged' and simply left them there for a while, without immediately talking price. Usually, Patsy would buy one or two things, and I would take the rest away. More than once I'd heard the Tisches argue about one of Patsy's intended purchases. 'Do we really need another green vase?' 'Yes, Steve, we do.' 'How come?' 'Because I want it, that's how come.' And Steve would wind up writing the check for 10 or 20 or 30 thousand dollars. It was what Hollywood husbands did to guarantee a truce with their wives. But one day I brought Patsy a Tiffany dogwood lamp, a monumental Grueby vase, and a great Teco, and carried them through the house, placing them where I thought they looked best. A week or so later, I called, assuming that, as usual, she would keep only one of the three. 'I want them all,' she said. 'All of them? But what about Steve? They're expensive.' I told Patsy the numbers. 'Don't worry about Steve,' she answered levelly. 'I'll handle him.' She asked me to come over that afternoon. Patsy looked stunning as always, and we sat in her living room, chatting. It was a Sunday, and Steve, when he showed up, said something about wanting to catch a game on TV. But when he saw me he stopped. 'You again,' he groaned. 'I'd better get the chequebook.' 'But don't you at least want to see what we're buying?' Patsy asked. 'They're very beautiful.' 'How much this time?' he asked. He was still looking at me. 'What do I owe you, Tod?' It was Patsy who answered. 'Seventy thousand.' Steve recoiled as though he'd been struck by a branding iron. 'You know I don't have that kind of money!' Patsy had got his attention. 'Oh, come on, Steve,' she said. 'Who are you kidding?' 'Well, for Christ's sake, not in the cheque account!' he said. 'I don't have that kind of money in the cheque account!' 'Well then, get it,' Patsy's voice was full of scorn. 'Just get it.' There was a moment of dead silence as they stared at each other across the room. Then Steve sat and took out his chequebook, signed the cheque, crumpled it, and tossed it to me. 'See ya, Tod,' he said. Then he stormed out of the house. I slipped out a few minutes later, wishing I hadn't seen what I had. I'd been half in love with Patsy myself, but I'd just seen a side of her that made me feel oddly sympathetic toward Steve Tisch. I never saw them together again, but I did see this same story played out countless times in different homes. It was as though once the Hollywood rich built their mansions and filled them, there was nothing left for them to do but get divorced. A few years later, that's what happened to the Tisches. Patsy, I heard later, remarried. Steve secured his place in Hollywood when he attached his name to Forrest Gump . I'd first run into Barbra Streisand at a country auction in New Jersey. She'd just begun to collect turn-of-the-century American art and, characteristically, she did so with a vengeance. Once I moved to California, I continued to bring her furniture and paintings for her Beverly Hills mansion. Frequently she called for advice when she was just about to buy something or had already bought it and was panicking that she had been taken. Early one evening, when I was back in New York, she called. 'I'm on my way to the Armory,' she said. The Winter Antiques Show is a major annual event held at the Seventh Regiment Armory on Park Avenue and 67th Street. 'I'll call you later. I want you to come over tonight and look at some things I'm buying. I'll have the housekeeper fix us dinner,' she said. It'll be just the two of us, I thought. 'Bring along something wonderful to whet my appetite.' This was a first. I'd never been invited to Barbra's apartment alone, and certainly not for dinner. It was almost 11pm when she called back to say she was just leaving the show. By this time my imagination had run amok. Who knew what could happen? Hadn't her hairdresser and sometime boyfriend, Jon Peters, become, at least for a time, an immensely powerful Hollywood producer? I rang the bell at Barbra's Central Park West duplex a little after 11. The housekeeper let me in - Ms Streisand wasn't home yet - and ushered me into a sitting room furnished with big puffy sinking couches and little tables. There were photographs of Barbra, Elliott Gould (her first husband), her son and other members of her family. A little later, I heard the front door open, then slam shut, and the sound of things being moved around. Then Barbra swept in and kissed me on both cheeks, her face still cold from the night air. 'How good it is to have you here,' she said. 'We'll eat in a minute. Let's just chat for a while.' She loved the three vases I'd brought. I have no idea what else we talked about, but I remember the intimacy and the soft timbre of her voice. 'Hungry?' she asked. 'Starving,' I admitted, smiling. 'Well, come on then,' she said gaily. 'Let's eat.' She led me back out through the entrance hall to the dining room. There were shopping bags she must have brought home from the Armory Show, and two chairs. I recognised them instantly. They were a matching pair of tall, spindle-back Frank Lloyd Wright side chairs. They were in perfect condition. But I recognised something else as I handled them: the unmistakable odour of varnish. They'd been refinished, and recently. How much had she paid? I was afraid to ask. If they'd been redone, their value had dropped through the floor. 'What do you think, Tod?'

      "body": "<p>I discovered I was about to stop being my mother's only child moments after walking through customs at Canberra airport in December 1980 (flight SQ84: memorable because the journey from London had taken three days, instead of the sched uled 27 hours). I was greeted by my mother, who had an enormous growth in the area of her midriff and was therefore unable to administer the hug I sorely needed. Intellectually, I knew what this growth was, of course, but emotionally I was confused. I hadn't seen my mother since the previous April, shortly before she and her partner, Arthur, had departed for a new life in Australia, the country of her birth (leaving me to move in with my father in London), though I'd spoken to her often enough on the phone. </p> <p>'What's that?' I said, pointing at the swelling. </p> <p>'That's your brother, Jonathan.' She replied, full of faux cheeriness. She was 42 years old, eight-and-a-half months pregnant and hadn't wanted to tell me on the phone. I never thought she made the right decision, neither at the time nor retrospectively: it had been painful enough losing her but, even as we were reunited, I felt not only separated again, I felt replaced. The secrecy also indicated a confusing degree of guilt and denial on her part. We had always been so close, physically and emotionally, throughout my childhood and my parents' divorce, but now I felt somehow betrayed. </p> <p>Three weeks later, on the night she went in to labour, I woke swiftly. The bedroom light had been switched on to reveal my mother hovering in the doorway with a towel between her legs. I knew what this meant, I'd seen enough films: it was time to boil kettles and make tea and panic, quietly but capably. We were stuck out in the bush, not exactly handy for the hospital (closest village: Bungendore, infamous for its deadly brown snakes; pop: few, if you discounted the snakes). I couldn't drive and my mother, obviously, was in no fit state to do so, while Arthur was at that point out cold, fully dressed, on the bed, having chosen this particular evening to go on a whisky bender. It was all a bit Mike Leigh. After some tea-drinking, contraction-timing and telephoning, eventually my mother ended up being driven to the hospital in Canberra by her brother, my uncle David, with a bleary Arthur bundled in the back. Meanwhile, I went to bed, drained but relieved. There was nothing to stay up for, after all - I knew the baby was a boy, and now he was on his way. </p> <p>I saw him the next day: Churchillian and crumpled, he looked just like a baby, albeit a rather sweet baby, but even his incontrovertible cuteness seemed unconnected to the extraordinary, unprecedented wave of emotion that this small creature immediately inspired. I was denied any choice in the matter - looking at him, I instantly loved him completely, consumingly and, given the context at least, quite irrationally. Nothing had prepared me for the solar-plexus-churning physicality of unconditional love, that fierce lionness kind of love more usually the preserve of new parents than reluctant siblings. But this was, I suppose, partly the result of the 16 years and nine months that separated our births and the fact that, though I had extremely ambivalent feelings about the way my mother had failed to prepare me for his arrival, these feelings were directed at her (and to a lesser extent, Arthur). No longer abstract, I didn't resent the reality of Jonny at all. Instead, I felt an instant and unbreakable bond. </p> <p>I returned to Australia for his first birthday. We shared a room and he woke me every morning, giggling and rocking back and forth in his cot. I was delighted by him, but even as I bonded with my brother, relations between me and Jonny's father were irreparably soured. I despised Arthur's drinking and the Mr Hyde beneath the sober and charming Dr Jekyll it invariably revealed. One 32 C day, while I was sunbathing in the garden, he appeared in a beery fug and hissed: 'She doesn't want you now, you know. We've got a new life here.' And though I strongly doubted whether this was true, nonetheless I didn't see my mother or brother for another six years. And I never saw Arthur again. </p> <p> Shortly after Arthur's death from cancer in 1990, I returned to Australia, to Goulburn, NSW ('Australia's first inland city', pop: 24,000), where my mother and brother were now living. Jonny was nine and I'd brought him lots of books because, when I was nine, books were all I'd ever needed to distract me from Big Bad Things. But I couldn't have got it more wrong: Jonny gave the covers a desultory, disappointed glance, muttered a muted, 'Thanks, plain-face' (his nickname for me, coined when he'd visited me in London for the first time at the age of seven. Diplomatically, he'd explained that it didn't mean I was plain in the normal sense of the word, just that I had a disconcertingly un-Aussie paleness. Either way, I've always liked its Native American ring) and then retreated straight to his bedroom and Scalextric, leaving the books on the sofa. </p> <p>'He's just been diagnosed as severely dyslexic,' explained my mother, apologetically. 'He can write his name and that's about it, though he's very good at maths.' I was mortified. Not only had Jonny just lost his father, but his strange and unfeasibly ancient sibling had just compounded this misery by pointing out yet another reason for him not to be cheerful. I tried to make it up to him over the next few weeks, attempting to tease the sad little boy out of thinking about the loss of his dad. Mostly I think I failed. </p> <p>Since then, I've seen Jonny three times: aged 14 and about 5ft 6in, on the uncomfortable, monosyllabic cusp of adolescence, sporting a pudding-basin haircut and a too-big blazer at my wedding. Then, less than two years later, in Australia, when the marriage had finished and I needed my mum, by which time Jonny was 5ft 10in or 11in. Voice long-since broken, he sported a nascent six-pack, chequerboard Crazy-Coloured hair and was branded head-to-toe by Nike in honour of his hero, Michael Jordan. The beautiful, green-eyed, freckled boy-child was all but gone. </p> <p>And then, last October, I came home from an early-morning dogwalk to find two messages on my answering machine. The first, predictably short and vague, was from Jonny: 'Hi, how ya going? Give me a call_'; the second, equally short but slightly weary-sounding, was from my mother: 'Hello darling. Hope you're well. Call me as soon as you can_' My tiny, fractured family is not given to phoning very often, so a call from both my mother and brother on the same day was unlikely to be a coincidence. I phoned my mother first. 'What's up?' </p> <p>'Ah, well, I think you should speak to Jonny_' </p> <p>I persisted: 'Look, obviously something's up. God forbid he's getting married or_' I paused, shuddered, 'becoming a dad!' But even as I said it, it sounded absurd. There was a weary sigh from 12,000 miles away. </p> <p>'Yes, the latter. And, what's more, it's due in November. I've only known myself for a few days_' </p> <p>But I'd already burst into reflexive tears before I'd even worked out exactly why I was crying, though as I talked to my mother she helped me to articulate it. Our emotions were oddly similar - which also meant, confusingly, that I was responding to this news more like Jonny's mother than his sister. The first emotion was a wave of semi-maternal disappointment (that a bright young man's life should be even potentially circumscribed by such a banal and unnecessary development); the second emotion was a very un- sisterly anger at the girl (how dare this 18-year-old strumpet - whom I'd never met and knew almost nothing about - attempt to trap my golden boy), while the third emotion was out-and-out, pure, unadulterated, old- fashioned envy. </p> <p>I'm not particularly proud to admit that, by the end of the call, it was the envy that resonated the most. And I think you know where I'm going with this, so let me take you straight there: I'm 36, gainfully employed, live in a spacious flat in a leafy part of London with my beloved dog, Possum. It is, by no stretch of the imagination, anything other than a privileged life and it would be absurd to pretend otherwise_ and yet even as I get more comfortable within this life (and by extension, less likely to adapt to any other sort), news of my brother's impending fatherhood put me in touch with the darker side of sibling rivalry for the very first time: all I could think was, 'My mother's first grandchild should have been mine_ the thunder-stealing little sod.' And then, just as I was hating myself for thinking this, my mother said, quietly, through the ether: 'It should have been you, darling. Even Jonny said that to me.' </p> <p>She meant it sweetly, of course, not judgmentally. She has never been one of those mothers who pester about the possibility of grandchildren, not even when I was married and it would have been appropriate. But lately both my parents, quite independently of each other, have taken to finishing phone conversations with the words 'And give Possum lots of kisses from Granny' or 'Grandpa', albeit ironically. </p> <p>I don't want to be the 'mother' of a dog, I want to be the mother of a child and discover the true depth of the feelings that Jonny's own arrival prompted 20 years ago. An experience that those friends of mine who are now mothers accept as a given and which threatens - if only from my perspective - to create a divisive gulf of experience between us. I want to have a baby not simply because my periods are becoming an increasingly painful and unpredictable reminder that my biological clich\u00e9 is ticking - no, I want one partly because I think I might (finally, amazingly) be nearly grown up enough to make a reasonable job of it. But though I'm ready to be considerably less selfish, this relative unselfishness also extends to wanting a child within the context of a strong relationship because, however unfashionable an opinion, I think that's where children are most likely to thrive. Obviously, I don't know if the ideal set of circumstances will ever present themselves, so I guess this fresh, ugly, bubbling sibling jealousy was about Jonny now having immediate access to a life-altering experience that I may not have. He was clearly about to relinquish his baby-brother status and become, suddenly, my teacher, and I wasn't quite ready for that. But, like having children, I guess there's never a right time. </p> <p>'I suppose I'd better call Jonny,' I said to my mother eventually, when the sobs had subsided. 'And say all the right things. Whatever the hell they are_' </p> <p>'Don't say anything you don't really feel,' counselled my mother. 'I know I didn't.' </p> <p>So I called him straightaway and sobbed and said lots of sisterly, 'supportive' and 'understanding' stuff I didn't really want to be saying. And after the short conversation (in which I did most of the talking because, even if he was about to become a father, Jonny was still a teenage manchild of few words, especially when confronted by a crying woman), I put down the phone and was furious with myself. All I'd really wanted to say was: 'Get out now, Jonny! Run as far and as fast as you can! Think Nike: \"Just Do It\"! The relationship won't work out. You're both children. Please, please, please don't Do the Right Thing_ Go and get a life instead.' But of course I hadn't said any of that. </p> <p>I spent quite a lot of the next few days on the phone to my mother. I went round to see my father, who is very fond of Jonny. 'Oh dear!' he said. 'What a shame_' which was pretty much all there was to say, really. And my male friends - metropolitan middle-class media thirty- and fortysomethings to a man - had similar reactions, along the lines of: 'Blimey! What's he going to do? You wouldn't see me for dust in that situation_' - which didn't come as much of a surprise. Those who are fathers had, for the most part, got around to it pretty late (and occasionally reluctantly), so the thought of becoming a parent in their teens was, presumably, incomprehensibly terrifying. </p> <p>However Jonny is (thankfully) not a metropolitan mediasomething but the product of a small Australian country town. So, perhaps, doing The Right Thing wasn't for him quite the unspeakable horror it had immediately appeared to be to me and the majority of my uncompromisingly sophisticated and indulgently self-absorbed friends. Maybe, for Jonny, Just Do It is less an advertising slogan than it is a code of honour. </p> <p>The baby, a boy - Jordan, in honour of Michael - was born a week later, five weeks premature. There were complications, blood loss and breathing difficulties, so his mother, Felicity, had an emergency C-section at Goulburn hospital and then, within the first few minutes of his life, Jordan was airlifted to a prem-unit in Canberra with Jonny by his side. As Felicity recuperated in Goulburn hospital, father and son camped in Canberra. </p> <p>'I can't hold him yet,' he told me, when I called the hospital the next day. 'But I can sort of stroke him.' </p> <p>'It must have been a bit scary?' </p> <p>'Yeah, bit hairy. He'll be right, though.' </p> <p>And so, in awe, I cried different tears when I listened to my baby brother who was no longer a boy but, suddenly, 150 per cent a man. I didn't send flowers, teddies or babygros, but I did make arrangements to visit, arriving on 17 November, which had been Jordan's due date. I spotted my mother, Jonny, Felicity and Jordan at Canberra airport before they saw me, which bought me a bit of time. There were echoes of 20 years ago, but on this occasion, at least, I knew I was wearing the right expression. After introductions and hugs, I held the small, crumpled squawking Jordan very briefly. I didn't cry. In fact, I didn't feel anything. If holding my brother for the first time had put me in touch with something bigger than both of us, then holding my baby nephew was_ like holding any baby. While he had certainly been the catalyst, it wasn't for this baby I had flown 12,000 miles. </p> <p>A few days later, after spending some time with my mother, who now lives in the bush an hour and a half away from Jonny, I went to stay overnight with the new family in Goulburn. In the evening, I had planned to take Jonny out for our first-ever restaurant dinner \u00e0 deux, while Felicity stayed in with Jordan and Erin Brockovich on video. I changed into high heels, at which Felicity took one look and demanded that Jonny iron a shirt. After restaurant suggestions from Felicity and her mother (who, at 35, is a year younger than me. Which information, needless to say, came as a bit of a shock but explains a lot), Jonny drove us both, still undecided, into Auburn Street, small-town Goulburn's low-rise main drag. </p> <p>'Where we goin' then, sis? The Blue Plate and The Steak House both sound,' he glanced at me, pulled a deliciously teenage face, 'a bit neeeurgh!' I laughed: 'Sod it, kiddo, let's go to the Fireside Inn.' At Goulburn's poshest restaurant, Jonny ate king prawns in chilli sauce followed by his very first duck and, because he was driving, drank only orange juice. We talked incessantly, greedily. </p> <p>'Tell me about the night I was born. I've heard the story so many times from Mum, about her going into your room when her waters broke and stuff, but where was Arthur? He's always sort of missing from the story.' </p> <p>I debated internally, briefly, whether or not to tell him, but it was a no-brainer, really. If Jonny was old enough to be a father himself, he was old enough to know the truth about his own. </p> <p>'Completely pissed. Out cold. But rest assured, he was there for your birth!' </p> <p>Jonny nodded. 'I thought it was something like that. But he was sober for the last few years, you know_' I told him I was glad. And then I asked if he felt like a grown-up now, since the arrival of his son. Which was really a polite way of asking if he felt trapped and miserable. </p> <p>'It's more like a sense of responsibility towards Jordan,' he said, levelly. 'Before, I'd just spend money on me and not think about it. Now I know I have to work_' And then he concentrated on the newly arrived sticky date pudding and caramel sauce which meant, I think, that he missed seeing my eyes well up. I was on my third glass of South Australian Chardonnay and felt sincerely sentimental: </p> <p>'I think you're an extraordinary young man,' I said suddenly, snuffling a bit. 'And that's not just because you're my brother.' He blushed to his peroxide roots, but he grinned, too. </p> <p> Jonathan David Berkeley Williams is now a handsome 6ft one-and-a-bit inches. He has four discreet tattoos, including a gothic 'J' (for Jonny and Jordan) on his back. Like his sister when she was his age, he still dyes his hair ridiculous colours and remains branded by Nike (in these fickle times, I think Jonny is the most singularly label-loyal young man I've ever met: he wears the Nike swoosh as a ring, and has had it dyed into his hair). He can read now (but prefers not to) and despite his obvious difficulties, made his mother very proud by staying at Goulburn High until he'd got his Higher School Certificate (the equivalent of A levels). He wore black tie, tails and green hair to his Graduation Formal, which is a bit like a Prom. </p> <p>He doesn't smoke (though I've never dared ask him about drugs) and, until he was a passenger in a car accident a couple of years ago, which damaged his spine and put paid to his professional dreams, he was also a very serious jock. He listens to trance and techno (though I don't know if he dances), drives a metallic purply-blue, customised 80s Nissan Pulsar, with which he tinkers lovingly in the vast garage of the small rented house (rotary clothesline, rose bushes, a brick barbie and three bedrooms) in the 'burbs of Goulburn, where he lives with Jordan and Felicity - no strumpet, after all, but a bright, self- composed young woman. </p> <p>After leaving school, Jonny went on a bar-tending course and currently works four nights in a nightclub in Goulburn and six shifts a week in a towel-making factory. He wants to learn how to mix a thousand cocktails and then hopefully become a professional mixologist, or manage a bar or restaurant. I have no doubt he will do both. I also think he could model if he wanted to, but when I mentioned the idea to the photographer who took these Beckhamesque portraits of Jonny and Jordan, he said: 'No, you want to keep him away from all that fashion crap. It might ruin him.' </p> <p>In fact, I don't think anything would ruin him, but at the same time I'd be sorry if he slipstreamed into the urban fast lane because he is, indeed, pretty much perfect as he is: a man amongst boys - sweet, smart, funny, honourable and steadfast. Last November, I finally met my extraordinarily ordinary grown-up baby brother and, though I never thought it possible, I love him even more.</p> <p>\u0095 Kathryn Flett travelled to Australia courtesy of The Australian Tourist Commission and Air New Zealand.

      "bodyText": "I discovered I was about to stop being my mother's only child moments after walking through customs at Canberra airport in December 1980 (flight SQ84: memorable because the journey from London had taken three days, instead of the sched uled 27 hours). I was greeted by my mother, who had an enormous growth in the area of her midriff and was therefore unable to administer the hug I sorely needed. Intellectually, I knew what this growth was, of course, but emotionally I was confused. I hadn't seen my mother since the previous April, shortly before she and her partner, Arthur, had departed for a new life in Australia, the country of her birth (leaving me to move in with my father in London), though I'd spoken to her often enough on the phone. 'What's that?' I said, pointing at the swelling. 'That's your brother, Jonathan.' She replied, full of faux cheeriness. She was 42 years old, eight-and-a-half months pregnant and hadn't wanted to tell me on the phone. I never thought she made the right decision, neither at the time nor retrospectively: it had been painful enough losing her but, even as we were reunited, I felt not only separated again, I felt replaced. The secrecy also indicated a confusing degree of guilt and denial on her part. We had always been so close, physically and emotionally, throughout my childhood and my parents' divorce, but now I felt somehow betrayed. Three weeks later, on the night she went in to labour, I woke swiftly. The bedroom light had been switched on to reveal my mother hovering in the doorway with a towel between her legs. I knew what this meant, I'd seen enough films: it was time to boil kettles and make tea and panic, quietly but capably. We were stuck out in the bush, not exactly handy for the hospital (closest village: Bungendore, infamous for its deadly brown snakes; pop: few, if you discounted the snakes). I couldn't drive and my mother, obviously, was in no fit state to do so, while Arthur was at that point out cold, fully dressed, on the bed, having chosen this particular evening to go on a whisky bender. It was all a bit Mike Leigh. After some tea-drinking, contraction-timing and telephoning, eventually my mother ended up being driven to the hospital in Canberra by her brother, my uncle David, with a bleary Arthur bundled in the back. Meanwhile, I went to bed, drained but relieved. There was nothing to stay up for, after all - I knew the baby was a boy, and now he was on his way. I saw him the next day: Churchillian and crumpled, he looked just like a baby, albeit a rather sweet baby, but even his incontrovertible cuteness seemed unconnected to the extraordinary, unprecedented wave of emotion that this small creature immediately inspired. I was denied any choice in the matter - looking at him, I instantly loved him completely, consumingly and, given the context at least, quite irrationally. Nothing had prepared me for the solar-plexus-churning physicality of unconditional love, that fierce lionness kind of love more usually the preserve of new parents than reluctant siblings. But this was, I suppose, partly the result of the 16 years and nine months that separated our births and the fact that, though I had extremely ambivalent feelings about the way my mother had failed to prepare me for his arrival, these feelings were directed at her (and to a lesser extent, Arthur). No longer abstract, I didn't resent the reality of Jonny at all. Instead, I felt an instant and unbreakable bond. I returned to Australia for his first birthday. We shared a room and he woke me every morning, giggling and rocking back and forth in his cot. I was delighted by him, but even as I bonded with my brother, relations between me and Jonny's father were irreparably soured. I despised Arthur's drinking and the Mr Hyde beneath the sober and charming Dr Jekyll it invariably revealed. One 32 C day, while I was sunbathing in the garden, he appeared in a beery fug and hissed: 'She doesn't want you now, you know. We've got a new life here.' And though I strongly doubted whether this was true, nonetheless I didn't see my mother or brother for another six years. And I never saw Arthur again. Shortly after Arthur's death from cancer in 1990, I returned to Australia, to Goulburn, NSW ('Australia's first inland city', pop: 24,000), where my mother and brother were now living. Jonny was nine and I'd brought him lots of books because, when I was nine, books were all I'd ever needed to distract me from Big Bad Things. But I couldn't have got it more wrong: Jonny gave the covers a desultory, disappointed glance, muttered a muted, 'Thanks, plain-face' (his nickname for me, coined when he'd visited me in London for the first time at the age of seven. Diplomatically, he'd explained that it didn't mean I was plain in the normal sense of the word, just that I had a disconcertingly un-Aussie paleness. Either way, I've always liked its Native American ring) and then retreated straight to his bedroom and Scalextric, leaving the books on the sofa. 'He's just been diagnosed as severely dyslexic,' explained my mother, apologetically. 'He can write his name and that's about it, though he's very good at maths.' I was mortified. Not only had Jonny just lost his father, but his strange and unfeasibly ancient sibling had just compounded this misery by pointing out yet another reason for him not to be cheerful. I tried to make it up to him over the next few weeks, attempting to tease the sad little boy out of thinking about the loss of his dad. Mostly I think I failed. Since then, I've seen Jonny three times: aged 14 and about 5ft 6in, on the uncomfortable, monosyllabic cusp of adolescence, sporting a pudding-basin haircut and a too-big blazer at my wedding. Then, less than two years later, in Australia, when the marriage had finished and I needed my mum, by which time Jonny was 5ft 10in or 11in. Voice long-since broken, he sported a nascent six-pack, chequerboard Crazy-Coloured hair and was branded head-to-toe by Nike in honour of his hero, Michael Jordan. The beautiful, green-eyed, freckled boy-child was all but gone. And then, last October, I came home from an early-morning dogwalk to find two messages on my answering machine. The first, predictably short and vague, was from Jonny: 'Hi, how ya going? Give me a call_'; the second, equally short but slightly weary-sounding, was from my mother: 'Hello darling. Hope you're well. Call me as soon as you can_' My tiny, fractured family is not given to phoning very often, so a call from both my mother and brother on the same day was unlikely to be a coincidence. I phoned my mother first. 'What's up?' 'Ah, well, I think you should speak to Jonny_' I persisted: 'Look, obviously something's up. God forbid he's getting married or_' I paused, shuddered, 'becoming a dad!' But even as I said it, it sounded absurd. There was a weary sigh from 12,000 miles away. 'Yes, the latter. And, what's more, it's due in November. I've only known myself for a few days_' But I'd already burst into reflexive tears before I'd even worked out exactly why I was crying, though as I talked to my mother she helped me to articulate it. Our emotions were oddly similar - which also meant, confusingly, that I was responding to this news more like Jonny's mother than his sister. The first emotion was a wave of semi-maternal disappointment (that a bright young man's life should be even potentially circumscribed by such a banal and unnecessary development); the second emotion was a very un- sisterly anger at the girl (how dare this 18-year-old strumpet - whom I'd never met and knew almost nothing about - attempt to trap my golden boy), while the third emotion was out-and-out, pure, unadulterated, old- fashioned envy. I'm not particularly proud to admit that, by the end of the call, it was the envy that resonated the most. And I think you know where I'm going with this, so let me take you straight there: I'm 36, gainfully employed, live in a spacious flat in a leafy part of London with my beloved dog, Possum. It is, by no stretch of the imagination, anything other than a privileged life and it would be absurd to pretend otherwise_ and yet even as I get more comfortable within this life (and by extension, less likely to adapt to any other sort), news of my brother's impending fatherhood put me in touch with the darker side of sibling rivalry for the very first time: all I could think was, 'My mother's first grandchild should have been mine_ the thunder-stealing little sod.' And then, just as I was hating myself for thinking this, my mother said, quietly, through the ether: 'It should have been you, darling. Even Jonny said that to me.' She meant it sweetly, of course, not judgmentally. She has never been one of those mothers who pester about the possibility of grandchildren, not even when I was married and it would have been appropriate. But lately both my parents, quite independently of each other, have taken to finishing phone conversations with the words 'And give Possum lots of kisses from Granny' or 'Grandpa', albeit ironically. I don't want to be the 'mother' of a dog, I want to be the mother of a child and discover the true depth of the feelings that Jonny's own arrival prompted 20 years ago. An experience that those friends of mine who are now mothers accept as a given and which threatens - if only from my perspective - to create a divisive gulf of experience between us. I want to have a baby not simply because my periods are becoming an increasingly painful and unpredictable reminder that my biological clich\u00e9 is ticking - no, I want one partly because I think I might (finally, amazingly) be nearly grown up enough to make a reasonable job of it. But though I'm ready to be considerably less selfish, this relative unselfishness also extends to wanting a child within the context of a strong relationship because, however unfashionable an opinion, I think that's where children are most likely to thrive. Obviously, I don't know if the ideal set of circumstances will ever present themselves, so I guess this fresh, ugly, bubbling sibling jealousy was about Jonny now having immediate access to a life-altering experience that I may not have. He was clearly about to relinquish his baby-brother status and become, suddenly, my teacher, and I wasn't quite ready for that. But, like having children, I guess there's never a right time. 'I suppose I'd better call Jonny,' I said to my mother eventually, when the sobs had subsided. 'And say all the right things. Whatever the hell they are_' 'Don't say anything you don't really feel,' counselled my mother. 'I know I didn't.' So I called him straightaway and sobbed and said lots of sisterly, 'supportive' and 'understanding' stuff I didn't really want to be saying. And after the short conversation (in which I did most of the talking because, even if he was about to become a father, Jonny was still a teenage manchild of few words, especially when confronted by a crying woman), I put down the phone and was furious with myself. All I'd really wanted to say was: 'Get out now, Jonny! Run as far and as fast as you can! Think Nike: \"Just Do It\"! The relationship won't work out. You're both children. Please, please, please don't Do the Right Thing_ Go and get a life instead.' But of course I hadn't said any of that. I spent quite a lot of the next few days on the phone to my mother. I went round to see my father, who is very fond of Jonny. 'Oh dear!' he said. 'What a shame_' which was pretty much all there was to say, really.

      "body": "<p>I was on a flight to San Francisco writing an outline for a documentary film I was making on chatrooms - software that allows two or more people to have live conversations via the internet. Suddenly, a voice blithely volunteered, 'That's me.' The man in the adjoining seat had obviously been reading the text on my laptop in which I had described the story of a married man in Brighton who was poised to begin an affair with a woman he had met online.</p> <p>We got talking. He was returning from New York, where he'd been on business and had driven out to New Jersey to meet a woman he had met in a chatroom several months earlier. He had been married for 12 years and had two children, 10 and seven.

Suddenly, a voice blithely volunteered, 'That's me.' The man in the adjoining seat had obviously been reading the text on my laptop in which I had described the story of a married man in Brighton who was poised to begin an affair with a woman he had met online. We got talking. He was returning from New York, where he'd been on business and had driven out to New Jersey to meet a woman he had met in a chatroom several months earlier. He had been married for 12 years and had two children, 10 and seven. 'Unless I can get from my marriage what I'm getting from this woman, then I don't think there's any point in going on.'

She understands why: 'I would have loved to live here after the war when there was equal access to health and education. Even when I first came here, there was some discretion about money. Now, the message is, you are what you have.' Alibhai-Brown says living in a rich country and being privileged makes her feel guilty. I try to give a lot of my time and money. I never forget how it was when I was growing up.'",

A phenomenal \u00a320 billion-plus has gone into them in the past two years.</p> <p>But with insurance company bonus rates on the decline and the problems of Equitable Life in the news, are the bonds as safe and attractive as people thought?</p> <p>Offered by leading life insurance companies, with-profits bonds are lump-sum investments - usually a minimum of around \u00a35,000 - which go into a mixture of equities, fixed-interest investments, property and cash. </p> <p>Like the regular premium version, returns are paid as annual bonuses and a terminal bonus on encashment or death.</p> <p>Payouts are smoothed out, so that some of the profits from good years are held over to boost returns when conditions are less buoyant. Once a bonus is added, it cannot be taken away.</p> <p>All proceeds have basic-rate tax deducted at source, so this is not an investment for non-taxpayers, but the bonds are attractive to people in, or coming up to, retirement because of their income flexibility. Basic-rate taxpayers can withdraw up to 5 per cent a year from the bond, with no further tax to pay. Higher-rate tax payers withdrawing 5 per cent a year can defer any liability until all the bond is withdrawn. By then, they may have become basic-rate tax payers and have no further liability.</p> <p>Withdrawals above 5 per cent can again be taken with no tax implications for those on the basic rate, although higher-rate payers would have to pay the equivalent to the difference between higher and basic rate in the year following the withdrawal.</p> <p>Any withdrawals exceeding the level of the annual bonus, however, could erode the capital. Those not needing an immediate income can simply let the returns accumulate.</p> <p>Quoted returns range from around 4.5 per cent to 8.5 per cent or more.</p> <p>But the headline rate can be misleading. A lower rate may represent only the current annual bonus; whereas a higher one could include elements of terminal as well. Also, some firms have a history of paying larger annual bonuses and smaller terminal ones, while with others the reverse is true.</p> <p>Past performance needs to be considered but, with Equitable Life in mind, investors need to consider the financial strength of the provider and its charges.</p> <p>There are many variations in fees. If the charges on one bond looks much lower than on others, it's probably because the provider is making up for them elsewhere, through lower allocation rates (the amount of your money that is actually invested) or early surrender penalties. Investors should check out discount brokers. These do not offer advice (although several publish free guides to with-profits bonds) but they do rebate a large part of the initial charge.</p> <p>With-profits bond investors should have at least a five-year term in mind. Some bonds will actually penalise you if you take your money out earlier. </p> <p>In some instances, usually in the early stages of a contract and when stock market conditions have been poor, companies may apply what is called a Market Value Adjuster (MVA), which allows them to pay less than the bonus rate announced. This is not usually applied to withdrawals due to death or if investors regularly take out sums below 7.5 per cent a year.</p> <p>So are with-profits bonds still a good investment? Stephen Aaron of the David Aaron Partnership of independent financial adviser thinks so: 'Returns have fallen, but by much less than with traditional investments.'</p> <p>'In most cases the real returns after inflation are considerably higher than five years ago.'</p> <p>Patrick Connolly of IFA Chartwells is also a fan. 'Perhaps there is rather more emphasis on terminal bonuses nowadays, making them a shade more risky, but overall, returns have held up very well and, in a number of cases, have improved.'</p> <p>The first choice for both Connolly and Aaron is the Prudential with-profits bond. 'Company strength is the main factor, followed by factors such as past performance and charges,' says Connolly.</p> <p> Aaron, with half an eye on a possible demutualisation windfall, also likes the bonds from Liverpool Victoria and Standard Life, while Connolly opts for Norwich Union, Scottish Mutual and Clerical Medical. </p> <p>\u0095 Guides to with-profits bonds are available from Chartwell (01225 321710, free of charge), and for \u00a31 from the David Aaron Partnership, Shelton House, High Street, Woburn Sands, MK17 8SD.</p>",

Like the regular premium version, returns are paid as annual bonuses and a terminal bonus on encashment or death. Payouts are smoothed out, so that some of the profits from good years are held over to boost returns when conditions are less buoyant. Once a bonus is added, it cannot be taken away. All proceeds have basic-rate tax deducted at source, so this is not an investment for non-taxpayers, but the bonds are attractive to people in, or coming up to, retirement because of their income flexibility. Basic-rate taxpayers can withdraw up to 5 per cent a year from the bond, with no further tax to pay. Higher-rate tax payers withdrawing 5 per cent a year can defer any liability until all the bond is withdrawn. By then, they may have become basic-rate tax payers and have no further liability. Withdrawals above 5 per cent can again be taken with no tax implications for those on the basic rate, although higher-rate payers would have to pay the equivalent to the difference between higher and basic rate in the year following the withdrawal. Any withdrawals exceeding the level of the annual bonus, however, could erode the capital. Those not needing an immediate income can simply let the returns accumulate. Quoted returns range from around 4.5 per cent to 8.5 per cent or more. But the headline rate can be misleading. A lower rate may represent only the current annual bonus; whereas a higher one could include elements of terminal as well. Also, some firms have a history of paying larger annual bonuses and smaller terminal ones, while with others the reverse is true. Past performance needs to be considered but, with Equitable Life in mind, investors need to consider the financial strength of the provider and its charges. There are many variations in fees. If the charges on one bond looks much lower than on others, it's probably because the provider is making up for them elsewhere, through lower allocation rates (the amount of your money that is actually invested) or early surrender penalties. Investors should check out discount brokers. These do not offer advice (although several publish free guides to with-profits bonds) but they do rebate a large part of the initial charge. With-profits bond investors should have at least a five-year term in mind. Some bonds will actually penalise you if you take your money out earlier. In some instances, usually in the early stages of a contract and when stock market conditions have been poor, companies may apply what is called a Market Value Adjuster (MVA), which allows them to pay less than the bonus rate announced. This is not usually applied to withdrawals due to death or if investors regularly take out sums below 7.5 per cent a year. So are with-profits bonds still a good investment? Stephen Aaron of the David Aaron Partnership of independent financial adviser thinks so: 'Returns have fallen, but by much less than with traditional investments.' 'In most cases the real returns after inflation are considerably higher than five years ago.' Patrick Connolly of IFA Chartwells is also a fan. 'Perhaps there is rather more emphasis on terminal bonuses nowadays, making them a shade more risky, but overall, returns have held up very well and, in a number of cases, have improved.' The first choice for both Connolly and Aaron is the Prudential with-profits bond. 'Company strength is the main factor, followed by factors such as past performance and charges,' says Connolly. Aaron, with half an eye on a possible demutualisation windfall, also likes the bonds from Liverpool Victoria and Standard Life, while Connolly opts for Norwich Union, Scottish Mutual and Clerical Medical. \u0095 Guides to with-profits bonds are available from Chartwell (01225 321710, free of charge), and for \u00a31 from the David Aaron Partnership, Shelton House, High Street, Woburn Sands, MK17 8SD.",

      "body": "<p>I left my first meeting with Maurice Rickards, founder of the Ephemera Society, with a copy of a letter in his collection, shakily handwritten on 11 May 1752 by a distressed maidservant. </p> <p>'My lady, I am very sorry for ye disapontement [sic] but I think every servant goes in danger of their life,' it begins. 'I am determined never to see my l[or]d no more _ I cannot stay longer than the latter end of the week for fear of his return. I am your ladyships duttyful ser[van]t, [signed] Eliz Metcalfe.' </p> <p>'This', explained Rickards, a scholarly man with a twinkle in his eye, 'is ephemera - the minor, transient documents of everyday life'. </p> <p>His definition has stuck. But to him, Elizabeth Metcalfe's despair was neither minor nor transient. Although we shall never know whether she had committed theft or was the victim of her lord's dalliance, her tremor, as I held her letter, seemed as palpable as it must have been in 1752. </p> <p>Rickards, an ex-graphic designer and photographer, had paid \u00a34 for it at an Ephemera Society fair. 'However mercurial a scrap like this,' he told me, 'I would feel ashamed to destroy it. I would feel almost that I had killed a person. I know it's a flight of fancy, but I mean it.' </p> <p>When we met in 1989 , he had been compiling an encyclopedia of ephemera for 12 years. He died in 1998, his life's work still incomplete. Now, however, his Encyclopedia of Ephemera has been published by the British Library, having been edited and completed by Professor Michael Twyman, director of the Centre for Ephemera Studies at Reading University. In it, under 'Handwritten Ephemera', one of 500 headings in the 402-page book, is Elizabeth's letter. </p> <p>Such comprehensive, first-ever guides - the encyclopedia is one of three recently published and reviewed here - are a boon to collectors. Whether about antique fishing tackle, twentieth-century factory ceramics, jigsaw puzzles or slot machines, they identify, discriminate and categorise, often creating a buoyant market for collectors. </p> <p>The encyclopedia wisely makes no attempt to assess prices - among collectors, a printed Victorian charity ticket for a bag of coals might change hands for \u00a33, an exquisitely engraved seventeenth-century trade card for \u00a34,000, while every transaction in manuscript ephemera is unique. But it does give context and status to those scraps, elevating them into primary historical sources that convey a flavour of the times that dry statistics cannot match. </p> <p>Historians Lord Briggs and Eric Hobsbawm make full use of ephemera to illustrate social history in their books. Such was Rickards' aim, too. </p> <p>Those charity tickets for coal, soup, meat or bread, for example, (the encyclopedia illustrates a coal ticket), would be called vouchers today. They tell us that Victorian charities did not trust the poor to spend money wisely, or were at pains to avoid unseemly scrambles for food and fuel. Although the approved supplier of the charity goods and an expiry date were printed on the ticket, the name of the ticket holder was not inscribed, so they were transferable. </p> <p>Judging also by the dirty, scuffed and limp condition of the Victorian coal ticket in my collection, such items circulated in exchange for money among the poor, no doubt at a discount, or as an alternative currency. So the charity bigwigs avoided soiling their hands, and the less deserving poor got their beer. At the end of the line, someone got some coal. One grubby little scrap of ephemera can tell a lot. </p> <p>Under dietary tables, the encyclopedia reveals a recipe for gruel - that Dickensian and much-hated institutional stomach-filler. Everybody has heard of gruel. But what exactly was it? According to the dietary tables of Derby County Jail of 1844, prison gruel consisted of oatmeal and water, sweetened on alternate days with molasses or sugar, and seasoned with salt. Ugh! </p> <p>The minutiae of everyday life, as revealed by the encyclopedia, make it not just a reference book but a fascinating read. </p> <p>In the period 1870 to 1914, your draper or haberdasher might claim he was short of farthings for change and try to palm you off with a packet of pins marked 'farthing change with thanks' (the origin of 'pin money'?) or a 'farthing novelette'- eight pages of smudgily printed tales of the upper classes. Both pins and novelettes, bought in bulk, yielded him a profit of 6d (two and a half pence) per gross. </p> <p>There are throwaways such as Tyburn tickets - to watch hangings - inn tallies, waybills, notices to quit, dance tokens, visiting cards, winkle bags, tangerine wrappers, club flyers and disinfected mail, as well as passports, fez labels, receipts for taxes on hats and dice, and ephemera intended to be collected such as cigarette cards, the first of this kind. Then there are affidavits for burial of the dead in wool - enforceable by law from 1667 until 1815. </p> <p>The book leaves a mystery unresolved. In 1820, according to its accounts, a Liverpool workhouse received \u00a3149. 6. 9. (\u00a3149.33)for 'urine collected in the house'. Who might have bought it? Farmers? Tanners? Answers on a postcard, please. </p> <p>Leslie Lewis Allen's book, The World's Show , is about commemorative items, such as medals struck in celebration of the Crystal Palace and events that took place in it.

      "bodyText": "I left my first meeting with Maurice Rickards, founder of the Ephemera Society, with a copy of a letter in his collection, shakily handwritten on 11 May 1752 by a distressed maidservant. 'My lady, I am very sorry for ye disapontement [sic] but I think every servant goes in danger of their life,' it begins. 'I am determined never to see my l[or]d no more _ I cannot stay longer than the latter end of the week for fear of his return. I am your ladyships duttyful ser[van]t, [signed] Eliz Metcalfe.' 'This', explained Rickards, a scholarly man with a twinkle in his eye, 'is ephemera - the minor, transient documents of everyday life'. His definition has stuck. But to him, Elizabeth Metcalfe's despair was neither minor nor transient. Although we shall never know whether she had committed theft or was the victim of her lord's dalliance, her tremor, as I held her letter, seemed as palpable as it must have been in 1752. Rickards, an ex-graphic designer and photographer, had paid \u00a34 for it at an Ephemera Society fair. 'However mercurial a scrap like this,' he told me, 'I would feel ashamed to destroy it. I would feel almost that I had killed a person. I know it's a flight of fancy, but I mean it.' When we met in 1989 , he had been compiling an encyclopedia of ephemera for 12 years. He died in 1998, his life's work still incomplete. Now, however, his Encyclopedia of Ephemera has been published by the British Library, having been edited and completed by Professor Michael Twyman, director of the Centre for Ephemera Studies at Reading University. In it, under 'Handwritten Ephemera', one of 500 headings in the 402-page book, is Elizabeth's letter. Such comprehensive, first-ever guides - the encyclopedia is one of three recently published and reviewed here - are a boon to collectors. Whether about antique fishing tackle, twentieth-century factory ceramics, jigsaw puzzles or slot machines, they identify, discriminate and categorise, often creating a buoyant market for collectors. The encyclopedia wisely makes no attempt to assess prices - among collectors, a printed Victorian charity ticket for a bag of coals might change hands for \u00a33, an exquisitely engraved seventeenth-century trade card for \u00a34,000, while every transaction in manuscript ephemera is unique. But it does give context and status to those scraps, elevating them into primary historical sources that convey a flavour of the times that dry statistics cannot match. Historians Lord Briggs and Eric Hobsbawm make full use of ephemera to illustrate social history in their books. Such was Rickards' aim, too. Those charity tickets for coal, soup, meat or bread, for example, (the encyclopedia illustrates a coal ticket), would be called vouchers today. They tell us that Victorian charities did not trust the poor to spend money wisely, or were at pains to avoid unseemly scrambles for food and fuel. Although the approved supplier of the charity goods and an expiry date were printed on the ticket, the name of the ticket holder was not inscribed, so they were transferable. Judging also by the dirty, scuffed and limp condition of the Victorian coal ticket in my collection, such items circulated in exchange for money among the poor, no doubt at a discount, or as an alternative currency. So the charity bigwigs avoided soiling their hands, and the less deserving poor got their beer. At the end of the line, someone got some coal. One grubby little scrap of ephemera can tell a lot. Under dietary tables, the encyclopedia reveals a recipe for gruel - that Dickensian and much-hated institutional stomach-filler. Everybody has heard of gruel. But what exactly was it? According to the dietary tables of Derby County Jail of 1844, prison gruel consisted of oatmeal and water, sweetened on alternate days with molasses or sugar, and seasoned with salt. Ugh! The minutiae of everyday life, as revealed by the encyclopedia, make it not just a reference book but a fascinating read. In the period 1870 to 1914, your draper or haberdasher might claim he was short of farthings for change and try to palm you off with a packet of pins marked 'farthing change with thanks' (the origin of 'pin money'?) or a 'farthing novelette'- eight pages of smudgily printed tales of the upper classes. Both pins and novelettes, bought in bulk, yielded him a profit of 6d (two and a half pence) per gross. There are throwaways such as Tyburn tickets - to watch hangings - inn tallies, waybills, notices to quit, dance tokens, visiting cards, winkle bags, tangerine wrappers, club flyers and disinfected mail, as well as passports, fez labels, receipts for taxes on hats and dice, and ephemera intended to be collected such as cigarette cards, the first of this kind. Then there are affidavits for burial of the dead in wool - enforceable by law from 1667 until 1815. The book leaves a mystery unresolved. In 1820, according to its accounts, a Liverpool workhouse received \u00a3149. 6. 9. (\u00a3149.33)for 'urine collected in the house'. Who might have bought it? Farmers? Tanners? Answers on a postcard, please. Leslie Lewis Allen's book, The World's Show , is about commemorative items, such as medals struck in celebration of the Crystal Palace and events that took place in it. You can still buy examples in street markets for under \u00a310, but this is the first book to catalogue them. It contains more than 500 and promises good hunting. Allen, a retired accountant, began his own collection when he was given a Coronation Medal worn by a friend who had been one of 100,000 children who greeted the newly crowned King George V and Queen Mary at the coronation f te at the south London palace in 1911. That number is a clue to the enormous scale of the building and grounds, originally built in Hyde Park in 1851 to house the Great Exhibition, but moved to Sydenham, where it was burnt down in 1936. Joseph Paxton's soaring, barrel-vaulted design of iron and glass, jotted down in minutes and built in weeks after the rejection of a committee's design for what looked like a brick lavatory, was arguably Britain's most sublime building. It still stirs collectors' hearts, especially when contrasted with the Dome, which achieved 6.5 million visitors in a year, compared with the Great Exhibition's 6 million in six months - in a country that then had little more than 20 million people. The Great Exhibition made a profit of \u00a3186,000 - equivalent to \u00a350m today. Among the Crystal Palace medals are some worn by children taking part in the annual national school orchestra competition.

      "bodyText": "Contact Available through independent financial advisers Aim To give pensioners potentially higher future income by equity investment, using the with-profits process to smooth out the peaks and troughs of the stock market. Bells &amp; whistles Uses the Britannic Assurance With Profits Fund, 'one of the top performing funds over recent years'. The insurer will tell clients exactly how the with-profits fund has performed each year, and how much it intends to hold over or pay out to smooth that year's returns. It also guarantees not to reduce bonuses if policyholders live longer than expected. How it works On reaching retirement age, you use the money in your pension fund to buy an Britannic annuity policy. This will provide a variable income for the rest of your life by investing in equities, property, fixed-interest and other investments. Britannic will try to offset stock market fluctuations by 'smoothing' - holding back some of the profits from good years to boost returns in poorer years. Your income is drawn partly from your original capital, partly from profits. This income can fall as well as rise. Minimum \u00a310,000 Charges No initial charge; annual charges guaranteed to be less than 1 per cent a year throughout the policyholder's life. Tax Income is liable to tax at the policyholder's top rate. Risk Low/medium Should you invest? Stuart Bayliss of specialist annuity adviser Annuity Direct says: 'It's a good product and answers some of the questions on the opacity of with-profits annuities, but it will require a lot of explanation by the adviser.' Nick Bamford of Cranleigh adviser Informed Choice says the product could appeal to people disappointed with conventional annuities: 'The performance of Britannic's with profits fund has been fine, and the level of risk is not as substantial as a unit-linked annuity or income drawdown.' Points out of 10 Bayliss - 7.5, Bamford - 6.",

Yet the Government wants more homes built on re-used 'brownfield' sites. </p> <p>There is no chance that on an island of 60 million people, everyone can live on a greenfield site, said Philip Wilbourn, of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics).The Department for the Environment, Transport and the Regions wants 60 per cent of all new homes on brownfield sites by 2008. In many places 80 per cent of new housing is on previously developed land. </p> <p>Even homeowners whose first preference would be for a greenfield development may be thinking again in the light of the recent floods and the ordeal of rail commuters during the prolonged Railtrack maintenance crisis. </p> <p>In the South there were many who felt certain greenfield sites shouldn't have had planning permission because they were in flood plains. But Keith Hamilton, former president of the Planning Officers' Society and a planning officer for Greater Manchester, says: 'In my neck of the woods, the major flood problems have involved brownfield areas', such as York. </p> <p>A great deal of brownfield development is along riverbanks or in flood plains, so flood risks should always be assessed. A recent report by the Commons committee on the Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs called for conditions to be imposed when permission was given for building in areas at risk. It recommended that allowances be made if there were flood defences and anti-flooding designs or construction techniques. These include using solid rather than plaster board walls and electricity fed from ceiling level. </p> <p>But brownfield does not necessarily mean urban. At Blenheim Grange in Essex, for example, Bovis Homes has converted the site of a former British Telecom radio station alongside the former Ongar-to-Epping railway line. The development includes a golf course with clubhouse and a small park. At Chorley, in the North West, Barratts and Redrow are spending \u00a3400 million on converting a former Ministry of Defence base into Buckshaw Village, which promises good communications links plus offices and community facilities. </p> <p>Urban brownfield developments may offer advantages such as proximity to jobs and social amenities. Concerns about schools, transport or crime can be overcome with thorough research, but don't just rely on a solicitor or estate agent. </p> <p>Land may be contaminated, and need cleaning up before building can start. But that is the developers' problem, says Pierre Williams of the House Builders' Federation, whose members build between 70 and 80per cent of all new UK homes. 'The standards for decontamination are very high,' he says. 'The land will have to be thoroughly tested, thoroughly cleaned up to an absolute standard.' </p> <p>However, the issue is not that simple, according to Landmark, a company providing information about the environmental risks of buying and selling property. It warns that some unlucky homeowners could end up paying. </p> <p>Since last April local authorities have had to identify contaminated land which is a threat to health. If the original polluter has gone, councils may have to require the current owners to clean it up. </p> <p>This warning is backed by Philip Wilbourn of Rics, who says the onus is on the purchaser to be as informed as possible: 'Wherever you live, be it the Orkneys or Orpington, Rics always recommends that property buyers now carry out some form of environmental due diligence.' </p> <p>'What you might need to know is not about the site itself, but about activity on the other side of the fence,' says Hamilton, the planner. </p> <p>Although an environmental assessment is carried out before the developer pur chases the site, it is difficult to tell the level of clean-up needed before work starts. The builders want the Government to underwrite at least part of the risk. </p> <p>Checks for potential buyers are reasonably easy. Just enter the postcode of a site on the Environment Agency website to find out the flood and existing pollution risks. </p> <p>Wilbourn at Rics also points to the \u00a339 Landmark 'Envirosearch,' which covers past and present contamination, mining, landfills, or nearby areas of ground that may have been filled, as well as flood risks. It can be ordered by your solicitor or directly from the Landmark website. </p> <p><strong>First, do some digging </strong></p> <p>Don't forget the basics: commission a structural survey whether or not the property has an National House Builders' Council warranty. </p> <p>Don't just rely on the usual local authority search carried out by your conveyancer or solicitor. Take a quick trip to the library and check the local newspapers: major property developments and concerns about contamination make good copy.</p> <p>The library is also a good source of information about Ofsted reports, schools' exam results and crime figures, as well as any plans to improve, or scale down, transport services and other facilities.</p> <p>Check the details of the planning consent from the local authority - and whether any conditions were placed on it.</p> <p>For information about flood risk visit the Environment Agency website at <a href=\"http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk\">www.environment-agency.gov.uk</a>. If there is a chance of flooding, check what safeguards are in place and whether the house was designed with this in mind.</p> <p>Details of the comprehensive Landmark Envirosearch service, as well as a free online facility, can be found at <a href=\"http://www.undermystreet.com\">www.undermystreet.com</a>.</p>",

If the original polluter has gone, councils may have to require the current owners to clean it up. This warning is backed by Philip Wilbourn of Rics, who says the onus is on the purchaser to be as informed as possible: 'Wherever you live, be it the Orkneys or Orpington, Rics always recommends that property buyers now carry out some form of environmental due diligence.' 'What you might need to know is not about the site itself, but about activity on the other side of the fence,' says Hamilton, the planner. Although an environmental assessment is carried out before the developer pur chases the site, it is difficult to tell the level of clean-up needed before work starts. The builders want the Government to underwrite at least part of the risk. Checks for potential buyers are reasonably easy. Just enter the postcode of a site on the Environment Agency website to find out the flood and existing pollution risks. Wilbourn at Rics also points to the \u00a339 Landmark 'Envirosearch,' which covers past and present contamination, mining, landfills, or nearby areas of ground that may have been filled, as well as flood risks. It can be ordered by your solicitor or directly from the Landmark website. First, do some digging Don't forget the basics: commission a structural survey whether or not the property has an National House Builders' Council warranty. Don't just rely on the usual local authority search carried out by your conveyancer or solicitor. Take a quick trip to the library and check the local newspapers: major property developments and concerns about contamination make good copy. The library is also a good source of information about Ofsted reports, schools' exam results and crime figures, as well as any plans to improve, or scale down, transport services and other facilities. Check the details of the planning consent from the local authority - and whether any conditions were placed on it. For information about flood risk visit the Environment Agency website at www.environment-agency.gov.uk. If there is a chance of flooding, check what safeguards are in place and whether the house was designed with this in mind. Details of the comprehensive Landmark Envirosearch service, as well as a free online facility, can be found at www.undermystreet.com.",

      "body": "<p><strong>Everyman: Hallelujah Kids</strong> BBC1<br><strong>In A Land of Plenty</strong> BBC2<br><strong> A Touch of Frost</strong> ITV<br><strong> The West Wing</strong> C4 </p> <p>Lafontaine, Indiana is a tiny backwoods town with the flimsy 2D appearance of a temporary movie set and a church both big and robust enough to cater to the town's entire population of 1,000 souls, hallelujah. It's the brainchild - godchild, even - of passionate evangelical pastor Mike Walters and his keepin' it in the family, fire and brimstone preachin' sons, Shaun, 19 and Jacob, 10. </p> <p>'They will come,' said Mike of his potential congregation, enthusiastically showing us his 'overspill' room - waiting in case they not only come, but keep on comin'. Like Kevin Costner in a god-fearin' remake of Field of Dreams , Mike believes his faith is more than enough to provide. Through donations he finds $2,000 a month to keep the show on the road in states where the radio ad voiceovers solicitously ask: 'Have you been raped, incested [sic] or molested? You can be freed from your past hurts. The \"Point of Pain\" package is yours for a gift of just $49 or more...', while phone-ins lament the black arts practised by Harry Potter. You couldn't make it up. </p> <p>Christopher Morris's Everyman was a pretty, wistful, sad and slightly surreal follow-up to a film he made for Children's BBC five years ago - An O Brother Where (fore) Art Thou? , with shades of David Lynch's The Straight Story . Back then, Shaun was a ferrety-faced 14- year-old close to perfecting that idiosyncratic southern preacher's pulpit delivery: 'Hallelu-ya, I-ya-have-a dream-a...', while covering 400,000 miles in a Cadillac driven by Mike, living in motels, eating in diners and casting out demons, as ordained teenagers are wont to do. Five years on and the Walters have upgraded to a shiny RV, with younger son Jacob now a part of the act. </p> <p>Walters has made demons the speciality of his House: 'With Mike it's all devils and demons,' said his ex-wife, Sheila, who despairs of her eldest son's future: 'He should be havin' a job, datin' girls'. But now Shaun, an introverted young man who really only comes alive in the pulpit, has been diagnosed as mildly autistic and is persistently haunted by the tools of his trade. 'Am I happy? Not really. Devil's fought me way too much. Tried to destroy my life too many times.' </p> <p>In less sensitive hands this could easily have been a freak show, but viewed in the week of the hideous Jerry Springerish circus surrounding the adoption of the 'internet twins', Belinda and Kimberley, it was clear that Mike Walters was not the Parent from Hell - his love for his sons and his faith in the Lord were all-too tangible - but simply out of his depth. Jacob even appeared to be flourishing - as well as could be expected of any child from a broken home who was about to be ordained as a child minister at a clapboard 'Love Cathedral' on the wrong side of Cleveland's tracks. </p> <p>None the less, the viewer was left knowing that Shaun's prospects for any kind of a normal life were receding faster than the two-lane blacktop in the RV's rear-view mirror. Even his mother recognises that Shaun urgently needs both sustained professional help and 'a pair of glasses'. Blind faith indeed. </p> <p>After a languorous opener I'd expected the second episode of BBC2's 10-part drama <strong>In a Land of Plenty</strong> might start indulging us with a bit of a plot, but we only got one in the final few minutes when Helen McCrory (as troubled matriarch Mary) dived out of a heavily-leaded window in slow motion - made to look considerably easier than one suspects it must be. Still, this tale of rich and boorish northern industrialist Charles Freeman, his fragile, sleepwalking, poetry-writing wife, Mary ('doom spins a grey halo around disconsolate heads'), and the four variously neglected and indulged children all clattering purposelessly around a 28-room house, is such sumptuously gorgeous viewing that everything that doesn't happen happens very seductively indeed. </p> <p>The slowest of slow motion, richly saturated colours (though that may just be my TV, which tends to give even a naked 40-watt light bulb a full-blown Spielbergian glow), lingering close-ups and a wonderfully rich use of music (from kitschy latin bossa novas to the theme from Z-Cars wafting from an off-screen TV as Mary's car made a late-night getaway), have all conspired to sustain interest and create a pretty momentum. But another eight parts? </p> <p>So far I don't feel as though I'm watching episodic dramatised snapshots of the Free man's lives, but that I've been invited round for supper and then, somewhat reluctantly, kidnapped. So slowly do events unfold that, given that the plot now hovers around 1969, by the end I could well be in my sixties. </p> <p>But, if you've already been seduced, for as long as In a Land of Plenty remains just the right side of pretentious, I'd advise sticking with it. TV drama too often fills up all the available empty spaces as if afraid of its own potential visual strength, but by allowing the gaps to weave their own story Plenty pretty much takes the opposite approach - fittingly, since its subject is childhood memory and the games that memories can play. It's really quite brave. </p> <p>Still, this softly-softly approach ensures ratings of 2.2 million, as compared with, say, 14.2m for last week's exhaustingly densely-woven <strong>A Touch of Frost</strong>. Indeed, this was so plot-heavy that the only way David Jason could justify an on-screen snack was because even the sandwich turned out to be responsible for another complicated strand of sub-plot. </p> <p>Meanwhile, was the woman whose hand had been amputated before she'd been mashed to a pulp on the railway line (and who worked for Simple Simon's Sarnies) part of the plot featuring a nasty female heart-surgeon, Dr Gibson ('No one in my team is going into his chest without excluding other inter-cardiac anomalies.' So there!), whose post-operative patients kept dying, especially if they were put in bed five? </p> <p>Unfortunately I wasted far too much time trying to make a link here, thus missing most of sub-plot three (ish), about the unpleasant young man smuggling cigarettes and rubber ducks and intimidating the owners of Denton's corner shops. But I rallied just in time to worry about Jack Frost's new sidekick, methadone-using Falklands war veteran Reid, who had nearly killed himself trying to arrest a Det Insp Jack Frost impostor who (in sub-plot one) had been busying himself groping Denton's female population. Then I faded again by the time we'd uncovered sub-plot four: the hospital's waste management scandal (timely shades of Bedfordshire here, with body parts, not to mention dead female heart surgeons, left in highly unsuitable locations overnight). </p> <p>The Serbian doctor turned out to have murdered Dr Gibson, of course. And, in sub-plot five (come on, keep up!), Anne turned out not to be Frost's long-lost daughter after all, which was a shame. </p> <p>Since the demise of Morse, Frost is now the pre-eminent late middle-aged male detective with a sorry past and no life to speak of, so we must make the most of him. But, if only for the sake of viewers' health, he ought to relax and take up whisky and Wagner in at least a couple of scenes each show. </p> <p>But then along came <strong>The West Wing</strong>, the long-awaited (on terrestrial TV, at least) and now nostalgically Democratic White House drama, which made the complexities of A Touch of Frost suddenly look like the test card as viewed on a particularly quiet Monday afternoon in 1974. </p> <p>I know this was the pilot, so every character not only had to be introduced, provided with a back story and a job description and then given something else to say, too... but hey! guys! like, slow down! </p> <p>Was it Leo or C.J. who was chief of staff? And what, if any, was his working relationship with Rob Lowe's deputy communications director, Sam? And who is Senator Russell? And was the escort agency girl a plant to lure Sam into a honeytrap, or was she really keen on him? And who was the guy who suddenly arrived at the end of the show, reciting the first commandment? Nope, it wasn't Mike Walters, it was Martin Sheen as a President whose clearly absurd levels of decency and commitment were indicated by the saccharine violins that accompanied him - revealed, in the credits, to have been over-orchestrated by my very favourite inspirational TV music maestro. So, congratulations on making it all the way from thirtysomething to the White House, W.G. Snuffy Walden - there's hope for the Free World yet.</p>",

The slowest of slow motion, richly saturated colours (though that may just be my TV, which tends to give even a naked 40-watt light bulb a full-blown Spielbergian glow), lingering close-ups and a wonderfully rich use of music (from kitschy latin bossa novas to the theme from Z-Cars wafting from an off-screen TV as Mary's car made a late-night getaway), have all conspired to sustain interest and create a pretty momentum. But another eight parts? So far I don't feel as though I'm watching episodic dramatised snapshots of the Free man's lives, but that I've been invited round for supper and then, somewhat reluctantly, kidnapped. So slowly do events unfold that, given that the plot now hovers around 1969, by the end I could well be in my sixties. But, if you've already been seduced, for as long as In a Land of Plenty remains just the right side of pretentious, I'd advise sticking with it. TV drama too often fills up all the available empty spaces as if afraid of its own potential visual strength, but by allowing the gaps to weave their own story Plenty pretty much takes the opposite approach - fittingly, since its subject is childhood memory and the games that memories can play. It's really quite brave. Still, this softly-softly approach ensures ratings of 2.2 million, as compared with, say, 14.2m for last week's exhaustingly densely-woven A Touch of Frost. Indeed, this was so plot-heavy that the only way David Jason could justify an on-screen snack was because even the sandwich turned out to be responsible for another complicated strand of sub-plot. Meanwhile, was the woman whose hand had been amputated before she'd been mashed to a pulp on the railway line (and who worked for Simple Simon's Sarnies) part of the plot featuring a nasty female heart-surgeon, Dr Gibson ('No one in my team is going into his chest without excluding other inter-cardiac anomalies.' So there!), whose post-operative patients kept dying, especially if they were put in bed five? Unfortunately I wasted far too much time trying to make a link here, thus missing most of sub-plot three (ish), about the unpleasant young man smuggling cigarettes and rubber ducks and intimidating the owners of Denton's corner shops. But I rallied just in time to worry about Jack Frost's new sidekick, methadone-using Falklands war veteran Reid, who had nearly killed himself trying to arrest a Det Insp Jack Frost impostor who (in sub-plot one) had been busying himself groping Denton's female population. Then I faded again by the time we'd uncovered sub-plot four: the hospital's waste management scandal (timely shades of Bedfordshire here, with body parts, not to mention dead female heart surgeons, left in highly unsuitable locations overnight). The Serbian doctor turned out to have murdered Dr Gibson, of course. And, in sub-plot five (come on, keep up!), Anne turned out not to be Frost's long-lost daughter after all, which was a shame. Since the demise of Morse, Frost is now the pre-eminent late middle-aged male detective with a sorry past and no life to speak of, so we must make the most of him. But, if only for the sake of viewers' health, he ought to relax and take up whisky and Wagner in at least a couple of scenes each show. But then along came The West Wing, the long-awaited (on terrestrial TV, at least) and now nostalgically Democratic White House drama, which made the complexities of A Touch of Frost suddenly look like the test card as viewed on a particularly quiet Monday afternoon in 1974. I know this was the pilot, so every character not only had to be introduced, provided with a back story and a job description and then given something else to say, too... but hey! guys! like, slow down! Was it Leo or C.J. who was chief of staff? And what, if any, was his working relationship with Rob Lowe's deputy communications director, Sam? And who is Senator Russell? And was the escort agency girl a plant to lure Sam into a honeytrap, or was she really keen on him? And who was the guy who suddenly arrived at the end of the show, reciting the first commandment? Nope, it wasn't Mike Walters, it was Martin Sheen as a President whose clearly absurd levels of decency and commitment were indicated by the saccharine violins that accompanied him - revealed, in the credits, to have been over-orchestrated by my very favourite inspirational TV music maestro. So, congratulations on making it all the way from thirtysomething to the White House, W.G. Snuffy Walden - there's hope for the Free World yet.",

But John Knell, of the Industrial Society think-tank, says: 'As jobs shift from physical work to being knowledge-based, fewer people will find that having a bad back or a chronic problem with their knee stops them doing their job.' </p> <p>This means fewer people will need to claim on permanent health plans for losing their jobs because of ill health. </p> <p>Changes are already starting to work through here. The Disability Discrimination Act of 1995 made it illegal to discriminate against people who have long-term medical conditions. Many cases have been brought under this law, and employers are increasingly trying to accommodate workers who have diabetes, industrial accidents, depression and other problems. </p> <p>A demographic shortage of twenty-something workers is making employers search harder for older employees. 'The balance of power has changed in the South of England,' says employment lawyer James Davies of solicitor Lewis Silkin. Employers now have to work far harder to retain staff. </p> <p>The bosses' changed attitudes will, in turn, raise the employment rate among disabled people. Only half of the disabled of working age now have jobs, though some groups do better: 68 per cent of the country's 300,000 diabetics are employed, for example. </p> <p>As employers become better informed and better equipped to deal with individual cases, employment rates will rise among other disabled people. </p> <p><strong> Breakthroughs</strong></p> <p> One of the biggest medical stories so far this year has been the successful work in the search for a cure for Alzheimer's disease. Since an estimated 700,000 people suffer from dementia, the implications of scientific research are enormous. </p> <p>A cure for Alzheimer's would change the equations that long-term care insurers build into their formulae for setting premiums. Govern ment campaigns to reduce the numbers of cancer deaths could also have a significant effect. And if you live in an area that has a first-rate approach to the treatment of stroke sufferers, your chances of maintaining a good quality of life after such an illness will also be substantially improved. </p> <p>Yet people do have to die of something in the end. The ideal would probably be to go suddenly after a lifetime of good health, but we cannot be sure this will be the pattern after we reduce the impact of the current big killers. One of the spooky questions for the new millennium will be to discover the modern causes of death after science does away with the traditional ones. </p> <p><strong> The NHS</strong></p> <p> Promising 7,000 new NHS hospital beds by 2004 and 100 new hospitals by 2010, the Government is increasing health spending. </p> <p>But will this, in the long run, make us healthier? And might this policy change if the Conservative Party ever came to power again? </p> <p>British politicians are unlikely to dismantle the NHS much further, although they have already privatised discreet areas such as dentistry, says Brendan Donnelly, former Tory MEP and healthcare specialist. </p> <p>'The NHS is one of the things that defines us as a country,' he says. 'If there are going to be fundamental changes to the NHS it will be because the Labour Government spends a lot more money on health and concludes that the extra did not make a difference.' </p> <p><strong> Genetic testing</strong></p> <p> The principle was accepted last November that insurers would be able to make use of some kinds of genetic testing information. If such tests become more widespread and insurers are given greater access to the results, a lot of the insurance market could disappear altogether in the long run. </p> <p>If buildings insurers jack up premiums on houses in floodplains, you can bet the same will happen to vulnerable people's medical cover, permanent health insurance, critical illness, life cover and long-term care plans.</p> <p><strong>Well-cushioned against the worst </strong></p> <p>William Stolten is one of that unusual and quite small band of people who are quite happy to pay large sums of money to insurance companies to buy protection. </p> <p>William, a 43-year-old recruitment consultant from Ashford, Kent, pays about \u00a350 a month into a permanent health policy, which would pay out about \u00a3400 a month if he was struck down by a serious illness and unable to continue to work.</p> <p>This PHI plan - arranged through his financial adviser, Torquil Clark - is a relatively uncommon form of insurance for ordinary people to buy.</p> <p>There are about 1.5 million PHI policies in place in the UK, according to the Association of British Insurers.</p> <p>'It makes you feel a lot better knowing that there is a cushion,' William says.</p> <p>'I can see that if you don't have this type of cover, you are possibly looking at a fair amount of misery.'</p> <p>The \u00a3400 a month he would get would not cover all his bills, but it would help maintain his standard of living.</p> <p>As insurer Friends Provident puts it in its literature: 'Statutory sick pay and other state benefits provided by the Government may help. However, they are principally designed to protect against poverty, and do not provide sufficient income to maintain most people's standard of living.'</p> <p>Although he is happy to pay for the cover, he did not get around to it until Torquil Clark raised the issue with him. He was then very positive about it - particularly since 'my mortgage has been rising over the years'.</p> <p>Not only did he buy the permanent health cover, but he also bought a policy to pay his mortgage in the event of accident or sickness.</p> <p>He accepts that all this cover costs him a fair amount, but has no doubt that it is worth while.</p> <p>'You get what you pay for,' says William. 'These policies do cover quite a few things.'</p>",

But John Knell, of the Industrial Society think-tank, says: 'As jobs shift from physical work to being knowledge-based, fewer people will find that having a bad back or a chronic problem with their knee stops them doing their job.' This means fewer people will need to claim on permanent health plans for losing their jobs because of ill health. Changes are already starting to work through here. The Disability Discrimination Act of 1995 made it illegal to discriminate against people who have long-term medical conditions. Many cases have been brought under this law, and employers are increasingly trying to accommodate workers who have diabetes, industrial accidents, depression and other problems. A demographic shortage of twenty-something workers is making employers search harder for older employees. 'The balance of power has changed in the South of England,' says employment lawyer James Davies of solicitor Lewis Silkin. Employers now have to work far harder to retain staff. The bosses' changed attitudes will, in turn, raise the employment rate among disabled people. Only half of the disabled of working age now have jobs, though some groups do better: 68 per cent of the country's 300,000 diabetics are employed, for example. As employers become better informed and better equipped to deal with individual cases, employment rates will rise among other disabled people. Breakthroughs One of the biggest medical stories so far this year has been the successful work in the search for a cure for Alzheimer's disease. Since an estimated 700,000 people suffer from dementia, the implications of scientific research are enormous. A cure for Alzheimer's would change the equations that long-term care insurers build into their formulae for setting premiums. Govern ment campaigns to reduce the numbers of cancer deaths could also have a significant effect. And if you live in an area that has a first-rate approach to the treatment of stroke sufferers, your chances of maintaining a good quality of life after such an illness will also be substantially improved. Yet people do have to die of something in the end. The ideal would probably be to go suddenly after a lifetime of good health, but we cannot be sure this will be the pattern after we reduce the impact of the current big killers. One of the spooky questions for the new millennium will be to discover the modern causes of death after science does away with the traditional ones. The NHS Promising 7,000 new NHS hospital beds by 2004 and 100 new hospitals by 2010, the Government is increasing health spending. But will this, in the long run, make us healthier? And might this policy change if the Conservative Party ever came to power again? British politicians are unlikely to dismantle the NHS much further, although they have already privatised discreet areas such as dentistry, says Brendan Donnelly, former Tory MEP and healthcare specialist. 'The NHS is one of the things that defines us as a country,' he says. 'If there are going to be fundamental changes to the NHS it will be because the Labour Government spends a lot more money on health and concludes that the extra did not make a difference.' Genetic testing The principle was accepted last November that insurers would be able to make use of some kinds of genetic testing information. If such tests become more widespread and insurers are given greater access to the results, a lot of the insurance market could disappear altogether in the long run. If buildings insurers jack up premiums on houses in floodplains, you can bet the same will happen to vulnerable people's medical cover, permanent health insurance, critical illness, life cover and long-term care plans. Well-cushioned against the worst William Stolten is one of that unusual and quite small band of people who are quite happy to pay large sums of money to insurance companies to buy protection. William, a 43-year-old recruitment consultant from Ashford, Kent, pays about \u00a350 a month into a permanent health policy, which would pay out about \u00a3400 a month if he was struck down by a serious illness and unable to continue to work. This PHI plan - arranged through his financial adviser, Torquil Clark - is a relatively uncommon form of insurance for ordinary people to buy. There are about 1.5 million PHI policies in place in the UK, according to the Association of British Insurers. 'It makes you feel a lot better knowing that there is a cushion,' William says. 'I can see that if you don't have this type of cover, you are possibly looking at a fair amount of misery.' The \u00a3400 a month he would get would not cover all his bills, but it would help maintain his standard of living. As insurer Friends Provident puts it in its literature: 'Statutory sick pay and other state benefits provided by the Government may help. However, they are principally designed to protect against poverty, and do not provide sufficient income to maintain most people's standard of living.' Although he is happy to pay for the cover, he did not get around to it until Torquil Clark raised the issue with him. He was then very positive about it - particularly since 'my mortgage has been rising over the years'. Not only did he buy the permanent health cover, but he also bought a policy to pay his mortgage in the event of accident or sickness. He accepts that all this cover costs him a fair amount, but has no doubt that it is worth while. 'You get what you pay for,' says William. 'These policies do cover quite a few things.'",

LWT's entertainment chief turned pop impresario reckons he can spot talent or a malleable wannabe at 20 paces. Maybe, but the ratings-grabbing experiment is a pale shadow of the real thing. The modern pop Svengali plans his teenyboppers' introduction to the public with an efficiency that would impress Alastair Campbell. </p> <p>Lou Pearlman is the current master of hitmaking. The 46-year-old former airline executive is perhaps the most important man in American music. He discovered and moulded Backstreet Boys, NSync and LFO who between them have sold almost 50 million records. (The bestselling album in America last year was NSync's No Strings Attached, which sold 10 million copies.) </p> <p>But Pearlman doesn't trawl the clubs and bars looking for the next big thing. In the Eighties, he made the travel arrangements for New Kids on the Block, but when he saw how much money they earned he decided to switch careers. </p> <p>Now he recruits the bands through ads and then puts them through his hit factory, Trans Continental, in Orlando, Florida. It's a kind of latterday Motown which teaches everything from syrupy harmonies to charming the media, although the end product is inferior. </p> <p>There is method behind his Midas touch.

      "bodyText": "If you've watched ITV's Popstars, you'll know all about Nigel Lythgoe or 'Nasty Nigel' as the tabloids have dubbed him. LWT's entertainment chief turned pop impresario reckons he can spot talent or a malleable wannabe at 20 paces. Maybe, but the ratings-grabbing experiment is a pale shadow of the real thing. The modern pop Svengali plans his teenyboppers' introduction to the public with an efficiency that would impress Alastair Campbell. Lou Pearlman is the current master of hitmaking. The 46-year-old former airline executive is perhaps the most important man in American music. He discovered and moulded Backstreet Boys, NSync and LFO who between them have sold almost 50 million records. (The bestselling album in America last year was NSync's No Strings Attached, which sold 10 million copies.) But Pearlman doesn't trawl the clubs and bars looking for the next big thing. In the Eighties, he made the travel arrangements for New Kids on the Block, but when he saw how much money they earned he decided to switch careers. Now he recruits the bands through ads and then puts them through his hit factory, Trans Continental, in Orlando, Florida. It's a kind of latterday Motown which teaches everything from syrupy harmonies to charming the media, although the end product is inferior. There is method behind his Midas touch. Each band comprises five basic types: one bashful, one rebel, one nice, one heartthrob and one 'ethnic' type. The model first worked for the Backstreet Boys, which he formed in 1993. Since then, Pearlman has become a very busy and rich man. Pearlman's prot\u00e9g\u00e9s are characterised by their slick, sanitised r'n'r, regimented dance steps and lavish promos.

Best men, take a tip from her (she writes fantastic speeches). Brides and grooms, ditto (she has thought hard about marriage). I was rocked by this play, tipped between laughter and dismay. It is lavishly scattered with jokes, like gaudy confetti, but its subject matter is drastic. It is about what happens when the words 'love', 'honour' and 'obey' are lost to Alzheimer's disease. </p> <p>That is not all. It involves two generations of one family: the beginning of a lesbian love affair, the end of a long marriage. What does it mean to pledge yourself to someone for life? Evelyn (Kika Markham) was once a doctor, now she is the patient. At times she sounds like a medical reference book - only no one is consulting her, she is merely discharging herself of facts. Markham manages beautifully to convey a mind that partly knows what is happening but is powerless to control itself. </p> <p>The glaring question is: who should look after her? Her husband (a sympathetic Andrew Hawkins) seems to love her dearly - we're reminded of his promise to look after her in sickness and in health - but she is too much for him. Her children are not up to it either. </p> <p>Lavery knows that laughter is possible even in terrible circumstances, a tonic even when it cannot be a cure. Her humour is wild and impossible to predict and Annie Castledine directs with perfect comic pitch. </p> <p>Evelyn's daughter Sally (Jackie Clunes) is gay - in every sense. Clunes has tremendous presence with her sweep of badly dyed red hair, huge blue eyes and lopsided punchline of a grin. And she sings brilliantly. But she is not as tough as she would like. She wants to control her love affair with Grace (Aicha Kossoko) and keep it light. But love is not always obedient and Grace has other ideas. Kossoko gives a great performance. She looks wonderful, too; a wry African Queen in burgundy velvet with a trailing curtain of dreadlocks. Sally's brother Robin (Brendan O'Hea) is also excellent. He turns every calamity into a film synopsis, a gag that never runs out of steam. </p> <p>I prefer to avoid plays and novels about Alzheimer's. But this should not be missed. I liked Lavery's conclusions about love and the dangers of trying to second-guess fate. Sometimes, she suggests, it is essential to live incautiously. </p> <p>It looks as though a Mediterranean snakes and ladders may be about to begin at the Pit - or wolves and ladders. The atmosphere of Simon Gonella's production (designer Nicky Gillibrand) of <strong> La Lupa</strong> is strange, poised between rural tedium and danger. As shadows give way to harvest light, peasants introduce themselves through dance: a man converts two scythes into a bull's horns; a woman makes her apron animate - as if she had suddenly acquired a new limb. </p> <p>This is a community where nothing escapes. There is no such thing as a private life or a secret lust. A nimble old lady (Janet Whiteside) kicks up her heels and tells alarming fairy tales; men are giddy with lust and boredom; young women watch themselves, for they are easy prey. </p> <p>This slender tragedy, by the Italian playwright Giovanni Verga (1840-1922), is expertly translated by David Lan. His aridly prosaic style has a power of its own; there is no decoration to distract. </p> <p>The drama is at its most involving when La Lupa herself (Brid Brennan) starts to dominate. In this close Catholic environment, her sexuality is seen as feral. She is a predator, a widow, a beauty in early middle age. She has a smiling, distant look, as if enjoying a seductress's private joke. Her daughter, Mara, is a shy version of herself and she proposes to give her away to win Nanni Lasca. Declan Conlon is excellent as the irresolute man who can neither trust nor blame himself. </p> <p>Mali Harries is marvellous, too, as Mara. When she marries, she looks like a traumatised corn dolly in her makeshift veil; her eyes swim with tears. Later, she is a harvest herself: happy and fruitful but not for long. Brid Brennan is formidable at the end: she looks at once like a little girl and an old lady. She is poised but lost forever. </p> <p>The 22nd International Mime Festival kicked off - or shuddered to a start - with <strong> BlackSky White</strong> from Moscow, at the Purcell Room. The show was like a preview of hell: it showed how it might feel to be robbed of speech but with a body on red alert. Masked faces struggled and failed to speak; only their bodies chattered in torment. When the yelling started, it was beyond them, part of a bodiless soundtrack that seemed to come from some groaning, roaring foundry. These clowns from Hades, juggling what looked like blood grapefruits, became tedious. Yet there was skill involved: everything, including gender, seemed to bend. A nightmare on the Embankment.</p>",

He alleges prominent players, including national team captains, had sex with the call girls as part of crooked deals that have destroyed cricket's honourable image.</p> <p>The prostitutes included a doctor, nurse, travel agent and glamorous television presenter. All were Australian apart from one Pakistani and a Chinese.</p> <p>Anti-corruption investigators of the International Cricket Council led by Sir Paul Condon, ex-commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, plan to interview the women next month in Australia.</p> <p>The revelations come as law enforcement agencies and cricket bodies worldwide intensify efforts to find out how deep-rooted the culture of players throwing matches for money has become in the game. Many big names have already been implicated.</p> <p>Ex-England captain Alec Stewart has recently been questioned by Condon's team over claims he received \u00a35,000 for passing information to an Indian bookmaker, which he has denied.</p> <p>Scotland Yard's Serious Crime Squad is probing claims by ex-England all-rounder Chris Lewis that he was approached by Indian sports promoter Aushim Khertepal to persuade three England colleagues to throw an Old Trafford Test against New Zealand in 1999.</p> <p>Condon and his team will take a list of 23 prostitutes when they fly to Melbourne for the ICC's quarterly meeting on 9 and 10 February. Condon's team, composed mostly of ex-senior police officers, will brief cricket's world governing body on the progress of inquiries before seeking to interview both prostitutes and illicit bookmakers also on the list.</p> <p>The list has been provided by Qasim Omar, a Pakistani player in the Eighties who appeared in 28 Test matches alongside such sporting greats as Imran Khan, Wasim Akram and Javed Miandad. He has told investigators about the sex for match-fixing set-up and has provided addresses and telephone numbers of all the women to Condon's team.</p> <p>Omar claims that, from the mid-Eighties, the prostitutes were supplied to the players by an Australian bookmaker through two madams in Sydney and that the network of prostitutes for players stretched across Australia from Brisbane to Perth.</p> <p>A spokesman for the investigating unit confirmed to The Observer that the list will be among the documents it will take, and said: 'There are other people we want to speak to, which we will try to do while we are out there.'

      "bodyText": "British investigators probing cricket's deepening corruption scandal are to question prostitutes who performed sexual favours for top players agreeing to fix matches. The women were used by illegal bookmakers to lure some of the game's best-known players into throwing games or to reward them for under-performing on the field, according to a former Pakistan Test batsman. He alleges prominent players, including national team captains, had sex with the call girls as part of crooked deals that have destroyed cricket's honourable image. The prostitutes included a doctor, nurse, travel agent and glamorous television presenter. All were Australian apart from one Pakistani and a Chinese. Anti-corruption investigators of the International Cricket Council led by Sir Paul Condon, ex-commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, plan to interview the women next month in Australia. The revelations come as law enforcement agencies and cricket bodies worldwide intensify efforts to find out how deep-rooted the culture of players throwing matches for money has become in the game. Many big names have already been implicated. Ex-England captain Alec Stewart has recently been questioned by Condon's team over claims he received \u00a35,000 for passing information to an Indian bookmaker, which he has denied. Scotland Yard's Serious Crime Squad is probing claims by ex-England all-rounder Chris Lewis that he was approached by Indian sports promoter Aushim Khertepal to persuade three England colleagues to throw an Old Trafford Test against New Zealand in 1999. Condon and his team will take a list of 23 prostitutes when they fly to Melbourne for the ICC's quarterly meeting on 9 and 10 February. Condon's team, composed mostly of ex-senior police officers, will brief cricket's world governing body on the progress of inquiries before seeking to interview both prostitutes and illicit bookmakers also on the list. The list has been provided by Qasim Omar, a Pakistani player in the Eighties who appeared in 28 Test matches alongside such sporting greats as Imran Khan, Wasim Akram and Javed Miandad. He has told investigators about the sex for match-fixing set-up and has provided addresses and telephone numbers of all the women to Condon's team. Omar claims that, from the mid-Eighties, the prostitutes were supplied to the players by an Australian bookmaker through two madams in Sydney and that the network of prostitutes for players stretched across Australia from Brisbane to Perth. A spokesman for the investigating unit confirmed to The Observer that the list will be among the documents it will take, and said: 'There are other people we want to speak to, which we will try to do while we are out there.' It is an opportunity to speak to as many of these people as possible.' Omar has also provided information about an identical sex scandal in New Zealand, again organised by a bookmaker, who has also been named. The Pakistani veteran was the first prominent player to blow the whistle on corruption in international cricket back in the mid-Eighties. He offered to give the authorities details of who was involved. But he was not asked for information and nothing was done about his claims. Omar has alleged that an Australian bookmaker lavished money and gifts on players - both Australian and visiting overseas stars - who did what he asked. According to him, batsmen were paid up to \u00a33,600 for throwing their wicket away, and received jewellery, watches, gold pens and bottles of spirits as extra perks. Omar has named one world-class batsman who was offered \u00a39,000 to throw his wicket away in the first four Tests of a five-match series, and a Test skipper who pocketed bungs for advising the bookmaker about the team he intended to field. In addition, he has also identified one top Asian bowler who deliberately under-performed in several matches in Australia because he needed the money to finish building a house. He claims deals were struck in hotels, such as the Sheraton in Sydney, a restaurant in the city's red light district and McDonald's in Melbourne. Condon's investigators will seek to interview Omar, who is now based in Britain, when they return from Australia. The six-strong anti-corruption team, which began its inquiries last September, hopes to present the ICC with an interim report into worldwide cricket corruption by mid-2001. It has been given three years by the ICC to root out corruption and set out how it can be banished from the game.",

      "body": "<p>New figures have revealed what women have long suspected: men are staying single longer so they can enjoy the delights of a bustling sex life. </p> <p>The average age of marriage for men has risen above 30 for the first time since records began, from 26 two decades ago. If the trend continues, 61 per cent of all men between the ages of 25 and 44 will be unmarried within 10 years, backing government predictions that Britain will soon need 500,000 new homes. </p> <p>Sociologists put the rise down to increasingly affluent single lifestyles and a desire to experience more partners before taking the decision to settle down. </p> <p>Marj Thoburn of Relate, the counselling service for couples and families, said: 'Even 20 years ago people were getting married just to have a long-term sexual relationship. It's not necessary now. You can bonk anyone you like.' </p> <p>Latest figures from the Office for National Statistics not only show a reluctance to marry, but also a trend towards single living among young people. </p> <p>Women, who in 1983 married at an average age of 24, are now postponing the event until 28. </p> <p>'It is difficult to know yet whether this represents an abandonment of marriage or a postponement of marriage,' said a spokesman at the Government Actuary's Department. </p> <p>Thoburn said there could be other reasons for the delay in tying the knot. 'We're aware that many more people are reluctant to marry until the biological clock is ticking and children are a consideration.

      "bodyText": "New figures have revealed what women have long suspected: men are staying single longer so they can enjoy the delights of a bustling sex life. The average age of marriage for men has risen above 30 for the first time since records began, from 26 two decades ago. If the trend continues, 61 per cent of all men between the ages of 25 and 44 will be unmarried within 10 years, backing government predictions that Britain will soon need 500,000 new homes. Sociologists put the rise down to increasingly affluent single lifestyles and a desire to experience more partners before taking the decision to settle down. Marj Thoburn of Relate, the counselling service for couples and families, said: 'Even 20 years ago people were getting married just to have a long-term sexual relationship. It's not necessary now. You can bonk anyone you like.' Latest figures from the Office for National Statistics not only show a reluctance to marry, but also a trend towards single living among young people. Women, who in 1983 married at an average age of 24, are now postponing the event until 28. 'It is difficult to know yet whether this represents an abandonment of marriage or a postponement of marriage,' said a spokesman at the Government Actuary's Department. Thoburn said there could be other reasons for the delay in tying the knot. 'We're aware that many more people are reluctant to marry until the biological clock is ticking and children are a consideration. Large numbers of people in their twenties and thirties have witnessed their parents' relationships break up. That can put them off.' Typical of the new breed of affluent single men is Tim Dean, a 28-year-old accountant from East Sussex. 'I've had three serious relationships but I don't feel under any pressure to settle down permanently.

      "bodyText": "Plans to remember millions of victims of the Holocaust next weekend are facing fresh controversy after the Government said the disputed Armenian massacre of 1915 would be included in the day's events. Home Office sources said the slaughter of 1.5 million Armenians by the Turks will now make up part of the Holocaust Memorial Day on Saturday, which will be attended by Tony Blair and Prince Charles. Last night Turkey objected 'in the strongest terms' to the inclusion. The huge event will be the first time there has been an official day to remember genocide victims, with particular emphasis on Jewish suffering. Stars who have agreed to attend the ceremony include Emma Thompson, Bob Geldof, Antony Sher and Ian McKellen. The climbdown came after pressure from Armenian groups which discovered that they were to be excluded from the memorial day because the deaths did not 'come within the right time frame'. They complained they were being ignored because of government sensitivities about Britain's relationship with Turkey, a Nato ally whose air bases are used to attack Iraqi targets. The Refugee Council also said the day was supposed to remember 'all victims of genocide'. The Government's capitulation now threatens a diplomatic row with Turkey which insists that the death of the Christian Armenians living in the Ottoman Empire should not be compared with the killing of six million Jews by the German state during the Second World War. Last week Turkey withdrew its ambassador from Paris after the French National Assembly voted to recognise the Armenian massacre as an act of genocide. 'This is the first we have heard about the Armenians making up part of the day,' a spokesman for the Turkish Embassy in London said. 'It was not genocide, it was different. It was not a systematic attempt by a government to destroy a people. The figures about the number of people who were killed are inaccurate, that is not an opinion, that is a fact.' But the Home Office denied the move could backfire. 'Everything will be mentioned [on the day],' one Home Office official told The Observer, distancing the Government from original plans to allow only atrocities committed after 1939 to be part of the ceremony. 'That was always the plan.' The BBC, which is covering the event and has controversially given overall editorial control to the Home Office, has also made it clear the events in Armenia will make up a section of its broadcast. Veteran BBC reporter John Simpson has been told to mention the massacre during his commentary on the day. 'This is an inclusive event and that means all victims of genocide will be remembered,' a BBC spokesman said, adding that Cambodian, Rwandan and Bosnian victims of genocide would also be included. The row reveals the delicate sensitivities that surround the event, which has been criticised for focusing too exclusively on the suffering of Jewish people. The ceremony, which will be held annually, was originally to be called International Genocide Day but the name was changed when the Government became nervous that not enough recognition was being given to Jewish deaths. The Home Office initially said that there would be a historical cut-off point for victims of genocide, saying the day would concentrate on the Holocaust and later massacres. That rule was relaxed after the event was seen to be in danger of descending into an unseemly row over recognition between different groups. kamal.ahmed@observer.co.uk",

      "body": "<p>The marmoset looked almost human. With bright, inquisitive eyes and a cheekily cocked head, it was fascinated by the world around it. The animals' odd resemblance to little people made South American primates such as this the model for Gremlins , the Hollywood horror movie, in which cute-looking alien beasts mimicked the humans they proceeded to terrorise.</p> <p>It is also these qualities that have led scientists to consider marmosets the near-perfect laboratory animal - although, in the case of the marmoset at Huntingdon Life Sciences (HLS) scuttling around a cage last week, it was the humans rather than the animals who were in control.</p> <p>The Observer was given unprecedented access last week to one of the HLS laboratories at the centre of the vicious, escalating row over animal testing. Scientists working there have received death threats and lobbying by activists forced the Royal Bank of Scotland to withdraw a \u00a322 million overdraft to the company, only for a mysterious American backer to step in and prevent HLS from going bust. The Government yesterday welcomed the deal, saying it would safeguard 1,100 jobs.</p> <p>The activists, in turn, have vowed to find the new backers - thought to be a US financial group - and launch an equally strident campaign to 'out' those responsible for saving the company.</p> <p>Not that this meant much to the marmoset being handled by Sharon, a worker at HLS who is regarded as an evil torturer by animal rights activists. Thrusting a heavily gloved hand into the cage, Sharon took hold of the mammal inside. The marmoset tried to resist, screeching and clinging on to the bars. But it finally stopped struggling and allowed her to carry it into the stark lights of the laboratory.</p> <p>Sharon's boss, a scientist identified only as Peter, explained what would happen next to the marmoset. 'We can dose it orally by mixing substances into its food or with a catheter inserted through the mouth directly into the stomach or intravenously into the leg veins.'</p> <p>Skin reactions were tested by shaving an area of skin and applying the chemical directly to the bald patch. At the end of each experiment the marmosets were killed, dissected and the tissues examined for signs of damage. A barbaric waste of a pre cious animal life or the necessary prelude to the next great medical breakthrough?</p> <p>Marmosets are a convenient size for animal researchers - about as big as a large rat. They weigh less than a kilo and tests can often be carried out by a single handler. Government guidelines say that all new medicines and vaccines must be tested on two distinct species of mammal; researchers usually begin with mice or rats and move on to dogs or monkeys. A rat-sized primate is therefore something of an ideal mammal in the world of vivisection.</p> <p>The marmosets are kept in a carefully monitored artificial environment, initially in family groups and then separately as the offspring reach maturity. Each cage is about two metres high, with enough room for the animals to exercise on hoops and ropes built into the cages. Feed is also sprinkled on the floor to allow them to forage as they would in the wild. Temperature is constant and the industrial striplighting flicks on and off in a regular 12-hourly cycle of laboratory night and day.</p> <p>Apart from their size, the beauty of marmosets for companies such as HLS is that they can be bred in captivity in Britain, unlike their larger Far Eastern primate cousins, which have to be imported. 'The animal rights movement has intimidated all the airlines out of flying primates into this country,' said Brian Cass, managing director. 'The marmoset will never completely replace the beagle or the larger primate, but they are an important new alternative.'</p> <p>At HLS marmosets have become an essential part of the rescue package for the firm - that and yesterday's \u00a322m loan. Just outside the village of Eye in Suffolk, away from the publicity of the main Cambridgeshire site, scientists from HLS are breeding a colony of marmosets for use in tests on pharmaceuticals and chemicals. The species comes from Brazil, but there is also a pure Suffolk breed entirely raised for animal testing. Today protesters from the Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty have organised a national demonstration at the company's Eye facility, which will shift the focus to the Suffolk institute.</p> <p>Last week The Observer obtained exclusive access to the Eye facility, a sprawling collection of warehouses and huts surrounded by razor wire deep in one of the bleakest corners of the Fens. We also visited the HLS main site outside at Alconbury, Cambridgeshire, where the testing on beagles and macaque monkeys is done.</p> <p>No animal-lover would find a visit to an HLS lab anything other than upsetting. There are marmosets that have never seen a jungle; beagles that have never been taken for a walk in the countryside; all manner of mammals, small and large, being bred so that they can be pumped with chemicals and then killed.</p> <p>Yet in our visits to the HLS sites we encountered a dedicated workforce determined to face down the threats from animal rights activists. Katrina, an animal technician who works with rats at Eye, said she came to HLS because she wanted to work with animals. 'I'm reluctant to say where I work, but it's frustrating because I'm proud of what I do,' she sighed.</p> <p>Her colleague Angela has received hate mail from protesters because she has shares in the company. She has to turn off her phone and fax when she goes to bed because otherwise they ring all night. She has also had her name printed on posters plastered around her village naming her as an 'animal abuser'. 'I believe in peaceful protest,' she said. 'But this can become very intimidating when you are just trying to do a job.'</p> <p>We encountered nothing other than well-regulated scientific procedures and animals being cared for as well as could be expected consid ering the fate that awaited them in the name of medicine.</p> <p>But this has not always been the case. HLS has been rocked by a series of undercover investigations, which revealed abuse of animals. The company's financial woes began in 1997 when a Channel 4 documentary, It's a Dog's Life , showed workers at Huntingdon shaking and punching beagles as they struggled to avoid having blood-samples taken.</p> <p>After a Home Office inquiry, the company was allowed to continue trading, but not before the collapse of its share price and the withdrawal of several large financial backers, including the Labour Party's pension fund.</p> <p>Then, last September, documents were leaked about experiments carried out at HLS for the Cambridge-based company Imutran, specialists in the new science of 'xenotransplantation'. The company aims to transplant the hearts of genetically engineered pigs into humans, but experiments on monkeys at HLS showed that more than a quarter of animals died on the operating table and in one case a monkey was mistakenly given a frozen heart.

      "bodyText": "The marmoset looked almost human. With bright, inquisitive eyes and a cheekily cocked head, it was fascinated by the world around it. The animals' odd resemblance to little people made South American primates such as this the model for Gremlins , the Hollywood horror movie, in which cute-looking alien beasts mimicked the humans they proceeded to terrorise. It is also these qualities that have led scientists to consider marmosets the near-perfect laboratory animal - although, in the case of the marmoset at Huntingdon Life Sciences (HLS) scuttling around a cage last week, it was the humans rather than the animals who were in control. The Observer was given unprecedented access last week to one of the HLS laboratories at the centre of the vicious, escalating row over animal testing. Scientists working there have received death threats and lobbying by activists forced the Royal Bank of Scotland to withdraw a \u00a322 million overdraft to the company, only for a mysterious American backer to step in and prevent HLS from going bust. The Government yesterday welcomed the deal, saying it would safeguard 1,100 jobs. The activists, in turn, have vowed to find the new backers - thought to be a US financial group - and launch an equally strident campaign to 'out' those responsible for saving the company. Not that this meant much to the marmoset being handled by Sharon, a worker at HLS who is regarded as an evil torturer by animal rights activists. Thrusting a heavily gloved hand into the cage, Sharon took hold of the mammal inside. The marmoset tried to resist, screeching and clinging on to the bars. But it finally stopped struggling and allowed her to carry it into the stark lights of the laboratory. Sharon's boss, a scientist identified only as Peter, explained what would happen next to the marmoset. 'We can dose it orally by mixing substances into its food or with a catheter inserted through the mouth directly into the stomach or intravenously into the leg veins.' Skin reactions were tested by shaving an area of skin and applying the chemical directly to the bald patch. At the end of each experiment the marmosets were killed, dissected and the tissues examined for signs of damage. A barbaric waste of a pre cious animal life or the necessary prelude to the next great medical breakthrough? Marmosets are a convenient size for animal researchers - about as big as a large rat. They weigh less than a kilo and tests can often be carried out by a single handler. Government guidelines say that all new medicines and vaccines must be tested on two distinct species of mammal; researchers usually begin with mice or rats and move on to dogs or monkeys. A rat-sized primate is therefore something of an ideal mammal in the world of vivisection. The marmosets are kept in a carefully monitored artificial environment, initially in family groups and then separately as the offspring reach maturity. Each cage is about two metres high, with enough room for the animals to exercise on hoops and ropes built into the cages. Feed is also sprinkled on the floor to allow them to forage as they would in the wild. Temperature is constant and the industrial striplighting flicks on and off in a regular 12-hourly cycle of laboratory night and day. Apart from their size, the beauty of marmosets for companies such as HLS is that they can be bred in captivity in Britain, unlike their larger Far Eastern primate cousins, which have to be imported. 'The animal rights movement has intimidated all the airlines out of flying primates into this country,' said Brian Cass, managing director. 'The marmoset will never completely replace the beagle or the larger primate, but they are an important new alternative.' At HLS marmosets have become an essential part of the rescue package for the firm - that and yesterday's \u00a322m loan. Just outside the village of Eye in Suffolk, away from the publicity of the main Cambridgeshire site, scientists from HLS are breeding a colony of marmosets for use in tests on pharmaceuticals and chemicals. The species comes from Brazil, but there is also a pure Suffolk breed entirely raised for animal testing. Today protesters from the Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty have organised a national demonstration at the company's Eye facility, which will shift the focus to the Suffolk institute. Last week The Observer obtained exclusive access to the Eye facility, a sprawling collection of warehouses and huts surrounded by razor wire deep in one of the bleakest corners of the Fens. We also visited the HLS main site outside at Alconbury, Cambridgeshire, where the testing on beagles and macaque monkeys is done. No animal-lover would find a visit to an HLS lab anything other than upsetting. There are marmosets that have never seen a jungle; beagles that have never been taken for a walk in the countryside; all manner of mammals, small and large, being bred so that they can be pumped with chemicals and then killed. Yet in our visits to the HLS sites we encountered a dedicated workforce determined to face down the threats from animal rights activists. Katrina, an animal technician who works with rats at Eye, said she came to HLS because she wanted to work with animals. 'I'm reluctant to say where I work, but it's frustrating because I'm proud of what I do,' she sighed. Her colleague Angela has received hate mail from protesters because she has shares in the company. She has to turn off her phone and fax when she goes to bed because otherwise they ring all night. She has also had her name printed on posters plastered around her village naming her as an 'animal abuser'. 'I believe in peaceful protest,' she said. 'But this can become very intimidating when you are just trying to do a job.' We encountered nothing other than well-regulated scientific procedures and animals being cared for as well as could be expected consid ering the fate that awaited them in the name of medicine. But this has not always been the case. HLS has been rocked by a series of undercover investigations, which revealed abuse of animals. The company's financial woes began in 1997 when a Channel 4 documentary, It's a Dog's Life , showed workers at Huntingdon shaking and punching beagles as they struggled to avoid having blood-samples taken. After a Home Office inquiry, the company was allowed to continue trading, but not before the collapse of its share price and the withdrawal of several large financial backers, including the Labour Party's pension fund. Then, last September, documents were leaked about experiments carried out at HLS for the Cambridge-based company Imutran, specialists in the new science of 'xenotransplantation'. The company aims to transplant the hearts of genetically engineered pigs into humans, but experiments on monkeys at HLS showed that more than a quarter of animals died on the operating table and in one case a monkey was mistakenly given a frozen heart. The monkey died. As a result of pressure from animal rights groups, the Home Office has been forced to investigate the xenotransplantation experiments at HLS. Imutran has now taken out an injunction against Dan Lyons, who led the campaign of animal rights group Uncaged, and the documents cannot be published in this country. The targeted action of groups such as Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty (Shac) and Uncaged has been highly effective. But senior executives at Huntingdon believe that the campaigners have been infiltrated by 'terrorist' elements, who have planted incendiary devices under the cars of lab staff. Shac demonstrators outside HLS last week said talk of terrorists undermining important medical research was a ploy by the company to distract attention from the genuine abuses uncovered by campaigners. 'What has been lost in this debate is that this is a contract laboratory,' said Les Stevens, an activist. 'It is a commercial operation. Most of the work done here has nothing to do with medical research. Its main work is testing household products and agrochemicals.' The client list of HLS is a closely guarded secret, but is known to have included giant pharmaceutical companies such as Glaxo-Wellcome and Roche in the past as well as the GM crops company Monsanto. But HLS's own in-house brochure confirms Shac's clams that a large proportion of its business comes from testing industrial chemicals such as paints, solvents, adhesives, dyes, detergents and flame-retardants. There is now no doubt that extreme elements in the animal rights movement are now prepared to intimidate and threaten people who work in animal laboratories. As The Observer reported last week, Scotland Yard's anti-terrorism branch is convinced that groups such as the Animal Rights Militia and the Justice Department are prepared to cause physical harm in pursuit of their aims. Last week they confirmed that a spate of bombings across the north of England over the past months is believed to be the work of animal rights activists. Last week, The Observer was also invited to the Ipswich Animal Rights campaign, one of a loose coalition of groups that will be demonstrating today at Eye. At the home of Meals On Wheels volunteer Dorren Brand, art teacher Diana Marshall and retired physiotherapist Jane Higgens, we watched Shac footage of abuses at HLS labs in Britain and the US. Marshall, who acts as a spokeswoman for the group, has been described by Huntingdon staff as 'a demonstrator of the cuddly, furry variety'. As the atmosphere of conspiracy heightens, she has become convinced that the firebombings may be the work of agents provocateurs . 'It suits them to label us all as terrorists so that they can bring in more laws to stop demonstrations. When you hold up a placard saying \"silent suffering,\" how threatening is that?' The threats against staff at Huntingdon continue; some staff have received letters telling them they hope their children die of cancer. Tonight a Channel 4 documentary about the history of the animal rights movement will show an interview with a wheelchair-bound Huntingdon shareholder, Andrew Blake, who is hoping that scientists will find a treatment for his rare condition of Friedreich's Ataxia. He has received letters from protesters calling him a 'spastic' and a 'sick cripple'.

      "body": "<p>Pinpricks of blood could soon reveal if a person is suffering from schizophrenia, the most debilitating of all mental illnesses.</p> <p>Scientists have revealed they can detect differences in levels of the brain chemical dopamine - closely linked to schizophrenia - in individuals' blood streams. The researchers claim the test is sufficiently accurate to pinpoint whether that blood came from a schizophrenic or a healthy individual.</p> <p>'We were able to differentiate between blood taken from 14 schizophrenics and a group of 10 people who were unaffected by the disease,' said Professor Sara Fuchs, of the Weizmann Institute in Israel. 'However, we have to make sure this is a reliable indicator of the disease before we can go any further, and have now launched trials on a much bigger sample.'</p> <p>At present, diagnoses of schizophrenia are based on observations of patients' behaviour. Typically, they feel their lives are being controlled, and their thoughts directed by others. They hear voices and can form delusions about the world around them.</p> <p>Just 1 per cent of the population suffer from the condition, which is known to involve the activity of dopamine, a chemical involved in communications between nerve cells. Dopamine locks on to receptor molecules on brain cells and directs their behaviour. The more dopamine receptor cells that a person has, the more likely that person is to have developed schizophrenia, researchers have found.</p> <p>'However, it is virtually impossible to count the dopamine receptors in a person's head,' added immunologist Fuchs, whose team's study is published in the current Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences . 'The only way would be to remove their brain cells, and count their receptors - which is not really practical.'</p> <p>However, the discovery that dopamine receptors are also found on the surfaces of white cells, which circulate in our bloodstream and help protect the body from invading bacteria and other microbes, has opened up new prospects for medical researchers.</p> <p>'Isolating white blood cells is a lot easier than sampling brain cells of living people,' said Fuchs. 'But counting dopamine receptors is still tricky.' So the Weizmann team analysed the genetic material that controls the making of receptors instead - and found a significant difference in one particular type, known as D3 receptors.</p> <p>It was found schizophrenics had, on average, more than three times the amounts of dopamine of healthy individuals, with levels varying from between 2.4 to 7.1.</p> <p>Pinpointing mental status from blood could be a powerful tool in dealing with psychiatric illnesses. But Fuchs warned the technique would have to be rigorously tested before being brought into widespread use. In particular, there could be a danger if tests gave too many false positives, labelling individuals as schizophrenic when they were actually unaffected by mental illness.</p> <p>'It's unlikely to be used to screen populations to uncover potential schizophrenics,' added Fuchs. 'It is unlikely to be accurate enough. However, it can take psychiatrists months to use behavioural criteria to diagnose the disease. This test could cut that dramatically.'</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:robin.mckie@observer.co.uk\">robin.mckie@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

Scientists have revealed they can detect differences in levels of the brain chemical dopamine - closely linked to schizophrenia - in individuals' blood streams. The researchers claim the test is sufficiently accurate to pinpoint whether that blood came from a schizophrenic or a healthy individual. 'We were able to differentiate between blood taken from 14 schizophrenics and a group of 10 people who were unaffected by the disease,' said Professor Sara Fuchs, of the Weizmann Institute in Israel. 'However, we have to make sure this is a reliable indicator of the disease before we can go any further, and have now launched trials on a much bigger sample.' At present, diagnoses of schizophrenia are based on observations of patients' behaviour. Typically, they feel their lives are being controlled, and their thoughts directed by others. They hear voices and can form delusions about the world around them. Just 1 per cent of the population suffer from the condition, which is known to involve the activity of dopamine, a chemical involved in communications between nerve cells. Dopamine locks on to receptor molecules on brain cells and directs their behaviour. The more dopamine receptor cells that a person has, the more likely that person is to have developed schizophrenia, researchers have found. 'However, it is virtually impossible to count the dopamine receptors in a person's head,' added immunologist Fuchs, whose team's study is published in the current Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences . 'The only way would be to remove their brain cells, and count their receptors - which is not really practical.' However, the discovery that dopamine receptors are also found on the surfaces of white cells, which circulate in our bloodstream and help protect the body from invading bacteria and other microbes, has opened up new prospects for medical researchers. 'Isolating white blood cells is a lot easier than sampling brain cells of living people,' said Fuchs. 'But counting dopamine receptors is still tricky.' So the Weizmann team analysed the genetic material that controls the making of receptors instead - and found a significant difference in one particular type, known as D3 receptors. It was found schizophrenics had, on average, more than three times the amounts of dopamine of healthy individuals, with levels varying from between 2.4 to 7.1. Pinpointing mental status from blood could be a powerful tool in dealing with psychiatric illnesses. But Fuchs warned the technique would have to be rigorously tested before being brought into widespread use. In particular, there could be a danger if tests gave too many false positives, labelling individuals as schizophrenic when they were actually unaffected by mental illness. 'It's unlikely to be used to screen populations to uncover potential schizophrenics,' added Fuchs. 'It is unlikely to be accurate enough. However, it can take psychiatrists months to use behavioural criteria to diagnose the disease. This test could cut that dramatically.' robin.mckie@observer.co.uk",

Congolese television reported that the cortege had trouble getting to its destination because thousands of people wanted to touch the coffin.</p> <p>When and where Kabila died still remains unclear, with Congolese and Zimbabwean officials contradicting one another. It emerged that some Western diplomats in Kinshasa had reported suspicions last week that the killing of Kabila showed signs of careful planning.</p> <p>Kabila's body had been loaded on to the presidential aircraft under the eyes of his former ally President Robert Mugabe as a Zimbabwean military band honoured the slain leader.</p> <p>A Congolese delegation escorted Kabila's body back to Congo. A state funeral is planned for Tuesday in Kinshasa. Mugabe, one of Kabila's key military allies, declared three days of mourning in Zimbabwe.</p> <p>Mugabe said his troops would continue to defend Congo from 'acts of aggression,' the state-controlled media reported yesterday.</p> <p>Zimbabwe has 11,000 troops, backed by air power and armour, fighting alongside government forces in Congo's two-and-a-half-year civil war. Angola and Namibia, who also back the government, have said they too will keep their troops in Congo for the time being.</p> <p>Rebels discontented by Kabila's rule launched the war in 1998 with the support of Rwanda and Uganda, who entered the Congo under the pretext of pursuing the Hutu rebels responsible for the Rwandan genocide in which 800,000 people died.</p> <p>In Kinshasa the mood was resigned. 'What do we care about generals and politicians?' said one shopkeeper. 'We do not mind a coup d'\u00e9tat that is for leaders. But we are afraid that if the army do not accept the change, or if they are not paid, they will start looting.'</p> <p>At a press conference in Kinshasa, UN Special Representative Kamel Morjane said all sides in the conflict had agreed to cooperate with the UN peacekeeping mission, sent to monitor a 1999 cease-fire agreement.</p> <p>On Friday, Congolese Communications Minister Dominique Sakombi announced that Kabila's son Joseph, who was named temporary head of government after his father was shot, would soon be sworn as President.</p> <p>To most Congolese, the younger Kabila remains a mystery. His installation as Kabila's replacement was rejected on Friday by rebel representatives and opposition groups in Belgium, Congo's former colonial ruler, who called for talks on Congo's political future.</p> <p>Details of last Tuesday's attack at the presidential palace in Kinshasa were still murky. A member of Kabila's security entourage has said a bodyguard shot the President. A number of bodyguards were arrested in the aftermath of the shooting along with senior members of Kabila's administration, relatives said.</p> <p>Former Belgian Foreign Affairs Minister Louis Michel later said he had received reports that Kabila was killed after a disagreement with some of his army generals. Kabila's hold over the army had grown increasingly tenuous, in recent months, with some troops reportedly threatening to revolt over pay demands.</p> <p>Prospects of a stabilisation of the long-running crisis in the Congo following Kabila's death were dashed yesterday by Information Minister Sakombi who said the late President had wanted to pursue the war. He said Kabila had wanted the forces to remain disciplined and calm, to protect the population, to defend Congo's integrity and 'to kick the aggressors out of the country'.</p> <p>All sides in the war have violated the Lusaka ceasefire, and the UN has balked at sending in troops until fighting stopped.</p> <p>Kabila came to power in May 1997 in a Ugandan and Rwandan-sponsored rebellion against the late dictator Mobutu Sese Seko. He was initially welcomed as an alternative to Mobutu's deeply corrupt, decades-long rule, which left the nation in ruins.</p> <p><b>Related stories</b><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/international/story/0,3604,424955,00.html\">19.1.2001: Kabila's son to be sworn in as president</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/international/story/0,3604,424681,00.html\">19.1.2001: Congo confirms that Kabila is dead</a><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/obituaries/story/0,3604,424653,00.html\">19.1.2001: Obituary</a><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/international/story/0,3604,424682,00.html\">19.1.2001: A son with no shining qualities</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/international/story/0,3604,424683,00.html\">19.1.2001: A country pays as foreigners fight for spoils of war</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "The body of assassinated Congolese President, Laurent Kabila, was flown to his home town of Lubumbashi yesterday as mystery deepened over the circumstances of his murder and his son Jospeh's succession. The white and gold casket, draped in the flag of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, was flown from Zimbabwe where he had been flown immediately after being shot, allegedly by one of his own bodyguards. The body was taken to Lubumbashi, where Kabila spent most of his time while ruling Congo. The former revolutionary, dilettante and brothel keeper, who was thrust into the limelight as a figurehead for the invading Rwandan and Ugandan forces (with whom he latter fell out) will lie in state there before being flown to the capital for the funeral. A band played sombre music as military and government officials filed past the open coffin displayed in front of the June 30th Building, where his hand-picked National Assembly met. Congolese television reported that the cortege had trouble getting to its destination because thousands of people wanted to touch the coffin. When and where Kabila died still remains unclear, with Congolese and Zimbabwean officials contradicting one another. It emerged that some Western diplomats in Kinshasa had reported suspicions last week that the killing of Kabila showed signs of careful planning. Kabila's body had been loaded on to the presidential aircraft under the eyes of his former ally President Robert Mugabe as a Zimbabwean military band honoured the slain leader. A Congolese delegation escorted Kabila's body back to Congo. A state funeral is planned for Tuesday in Kinshasa. Mugabe, one of Kabila's key military allies, declared three days of mourning in Zimbabwe. Mugabe said his troops would continue to defend Congo from 'acts of aggression,' the state-controlled media reported yesterday. Zimbabwe has 11,000 troops, backed by air power and armour, fighting alongside government forces in Congo's two-and-a-half-year civil war. Angola and Namibia, who also back the government, have said they too will keep their troops in Congo for the time being. Rebels discontented by Kabila's rule launched the war in 1998 with the support of Rwanda and Uganda, who entered the Congo under the pretext of pursuing the Hutu rebels responsible for the Rwandan genocide in which 800,000 people died. In Kinshasa the mood was resigned. 'What do we care about generals and politicians?' said one shopkeeper. 'We do not mind a coup d'\u00e9tat that is for leaders. But we are afraid that if the army do not accept the change, or if they are not paid, they will start looting.' At a press conference in Kinshasa, UN Special Representative Kamel Morjane said all sides in the conflict had agreed to cooperate with the UN peacekeeping mission, sent to monitor a 1999 cease-fire agreement. On Friday, Congolese Communications Minister Dominique Sakombi announced that Kabila's son Joseph, who was named temporary head of government after his father was shot, would soon be sworn as President. To most Congolese, the younger Kabila remains a mystery. His installation as Kabila's replacement was rejected on Friday by rebel representatives and opposition groups in Belgium, Congo's former colonial ruler, who called for talks on Congo's political future. Details of last Tuesday's attack at the presidential palace in Kinshasa were still murky. A member of Kabila's security entourage has said a bodyguard shot the President. A number of bodyguards were arrested in the aftermath of the shooting along with senior members of Kabila's administration, relatives said. Former Belgian Foreign Affairs Minister Louis Michel later said he had received reports that Kabila was killed after a disagreement with some of his army generals. Kabila's hold over the army had grown increasingly tenuous, in recent months, with some troops reportedly threatening to revolt over pay demands. Prospects of a stabilisation of the long-running crisis in the Congo following Kabila's death were dashed yesterday by Information Minister Sakombi who said the late President had wanted to pursue the war. He said Kabila had wanted the forces to remain disciplined and calm, to protect the population, to defend Congo's integrity and 'to kick the aggressors out of the country'. All sides in the war have violated the Lusaka ceasefire, and the UN has balked at sending in troops until fighting stopped. Kabila came to power in May 1997 in a Ugandan and Rwandan-sponsored rebellion against the late dictator Mobutu Sese Seko. He was initially welcomed as an alternative to Mobutu's deeply corrupt, decades-long rule, which left the nation in ruins.

Samir Rahmen-Adam, 23, had travelled from London to Bulani to take part in an arranged marriage to Raja's nephew, Mohammed Aslan. The marriage was not successful and after a few weeks Rahmen-Adam returned to London and asked for a divorce. Unusually, her father supported her in the move and agreed to let her remain in Britain.

Raja has been sending back money to support Rahmen-Adam's former husband and was therefore seen as the main UK representative of the family.</p> <p>Suleman secured a second mortgage on his property and used the money to set up an alibi for the murder. By November he had purchased a car, acquired a sawn-off shotgun and then travelled to Paris, telling friends he was going on a long holiday. On 28 November, the day before the murder, he slipped back into the UK and blasted Raja to death minutes after he opened up for business. Suleman then fled back to Pakistan via France and Holland.</p> <p>Four days after Raja died, Suleman phoned Raja's distant cousin, Javid Sharif, the man who had organised his second mortgage. 'Do you like my work? I shot him,' Suleman said. When Javed protested, he continued: 'He had to go. He's the top man. I knew you would not like it. I'm going to go back to kill a few more.'</p> <p>Back in Bulani, Suleman was equally boastful. As Raja's funeral procession passed through the village, he stood on a nearby rooftop and fired an AK47 rifle into the air while shouting out that he had killed him. Suleman was eventually arrested while trying to return to the UK via Holland.</p> <p>During a seven-week murder trial which ended last week, a new picture of Raja surfaced. He had come to Britain in 1992 leaving his first wife and four children behind. While living in Bulani, he was said to have worked as a henchman for a local MP and had spent time in prison for crimes including kidnap and extortion. Raja was also said to have been responsible for the death of a bus conductor whom he killed in a fight following a quarrel.</p> <p>According to Suleman's brother, Qamar, they were the ones who felt threatened. 'It was well known that the person who had murdered our Daddy wanted to murder us too. Raja was a dangerous man. He had committed numerous murders and had numerous enemies in Pakistan,' said Qamar.</p> <p>Last Wednesday Suleman Adam was convicted of murder and sent to jail for life. Qamar and Samir, who had stood trial for murder and conspiracy to murder respectively, were both acquitted.</p> <p>The officer in charge of the case, Detective Chief Inspector Paul McAleenan, told The Observer : 'It is the end of a very sad chapter for both families.

      "body": "<p>Gaving Young, who died in London last week at 72, was a star foreign correspondent of the postwar Observer, who went on to become a famous writer. Unusually for a journalist he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. Less unusually for a journalist of his generation he was also, briefly, a member of MI6.</p> <p>He scarcely fitted the popular idea of a journalist when he arrived at The Observer 's poky offices in Tudor Street, off Fleet Street, in 1959 from a job in Morocco with Radio Maroc. His new colleagues thought the tall, well-built young man with a silk handkerchief in his breast pocket looked like a 'successful young brigadier'.</p> <p>David Astor, then editor, often employed people with little experience of journalism. The Observer quickly helped him discover his own passion for writing, but he was already aware of the other great passion in his life - travel.</p> <p>England never meant much to him. Educated at Rugby and Oxford he seldom talked about either. Inspiration came from the Celtic fringes, holidays in Cornwall and Wales. National Service with the Welsh Guards in Palestine gave him a taste for the Arab way of life.</p> <p>His father was a professional soldier, but other Youngs had travelled the world as traders. Young seemed to be following their example when in 1951, aged 22, he joined a shipping company in Basra in the Persian Gulf, but two encounters changed his life.</p> <p>He met the explorer Wilfred Thesiger, who laughed at Young's suggestion they cross the Saudi desert by camel, and instead took him to the Marsh Arabs of Iraq where Young stayed for two years. And he was recruited into espionage by a pair of enterprising MI6 officers, Nigel Clive and Alexis Forter. Young learnt from Thesiger to travel simply, and to treat all he met as equals.

      "bodyText": "Gaving Young, who died in London last week at 72, was a star foreign correspondent of the postwar Observer, who went on to become a famous writer. Unusually for a journalist he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. Less unusually for a journalist of his generation he was also, briefly, a member of MI6. He scarcely fitted the popular idea of a journalist when he arrived at The Observer 's poky offices in Tudor Street, off Fleet Street, in 1959 from a job in Morocco with Radio Maroc. His new colleagues thought the tall, well-built young man with a silk handkerchief in his breast pocket looked like a 'successful young brigadier'. David Astor, then editor, often employed people with little experience of journalism. The Observer quickly helped him discover his own passion for writing, but he was already aware of the other great passion in his life - travel. England never meant much to him. Educated at Rugby and Oxford he seldom talked about either. Inspiration came from the Celtic fringes, holidays in Cornwall and Wales. National Service with the Welsh Guards in Palestine gave him a taste for the Arab way of life. His father was a professional soldier, but other Youngs had travelled the world as traders. Young seemed to be following their example when in 1951, aged 22, he joined a shipping company in Basra in the Persian Gulf, but two encounters changed his life. He met the explorer Wilfred Thesiger, who laughed at Young's suggestion they cross the Saudi desert by camel, and instead took him to the Marsh Arabs of Iraq where Young stayed for two years. And he was recruited into espionage by a pair of enterprising MI6 officers, Nigel Clive and Alexis Forter. Young learnt from Thesiger to travel simply, and to treat all he met as equals. Clive and Forter showed him how power worked. They failed to interest him in conventional politics, and he came to ridicule most writing about it as 'political knitting'. He once hinted he was involved in the Anglo-American operation that restored the Shah of Persia to his throne in 1953. He was neither guilty nor proud about his short association with the spies, who lost their attraction for him when he started to travel and write for The Observer. In 1961 he trekked into the mountains of north-east India to meet Naga rebels who were resisting the Indian government. The achievement involved more than courage and physical toughness. When growing up he had come across books by Conrad. It was a remark of Conrad's that summed up the essence of the unusual young correspondent's talent: 'By the power of the written word to make you hear, to make you feel - it is before all, to make you see.' The one place Young's readers caught little sight of was New York, where he was posted later in the Sixties, for he filed few, if any, stories from there. New York suited his sociable nature. A 'life enhancer' (his expression), he admired this quality in others, and his parties were attended by the likes of Norman Mailer, Gore Vidal and Mary McCarthy. He had friends in show business and jazz (he played jazz piano himself). He knew, and almost wrote a book about, the American wits such as Groucho Marx and Jack Benny. Young won awards for stories about the subcontinent, Africa and the Middle East, but Vietnam meant most to him: on his first visit there in 1965 he met a Vietnamese family he was bound to for the rest of his life. He came across its young men during a violent demonstration by Buddhist students in the old capital Hue. Later they took him home to meet the family's matriarch. The slight and dignified Madame Bong drew confidence from the correspondent who used his physical presence to inspire calm rather than threat. Young liked teasing friends. He teased the Bong tribe, too, but the amused look that in New York or London might signal a barbed remark reflected only admiration and affection for his Vietnamese. By 1975, when Astor retired as editor, Young was losing his taste for journalism. He went back to the Marsh Arabs and wrote a book about them, but his breakthrough as a writer came with Slow Boat to China and its successor Slow Boats Home. His agent and publisher dismissed as boring his idea of making a voyage to China and back by whatever ships came to hand, and he was in gloomy mood when The Observer' s literary editor Terry Kilmartin took him to lunch with the agent Gillon Aitken. Just back from abroad, Young spent most of the lunch opening his mail, but Aitken liked his idea, and they became friends.

A child so described is exactly the child that anyone with any humanity, and indeed any intellect, would want to protect. Intellect tells us that every child of eight years old that smells of 'urine and faeces' is being neglected. Humanity does not reject disfigurement.</p> <p>The people who turned away from Anna thought only of themselves and had lost their focus on the child. It is at this level that changes need to be made to protect children.<br><b> Margaret Laughton </b><br>London SE27</p> <p>Your reporting on the case of Anna Climbie omits one salient point. Lisa Arthurworrey, the young social worker involved, according to a report on television news, receives \u00a39,000 per annum, approximately equal to the weekly pay of a spotty-faced lager lout in the City of London. If the salary of social workers was trebled by a Government who thinks it a greater priority to waste billions on such fripperies as the Millennium Dome, perhaps a career in social services might appear attractive to persons of high calibre and recruitment could be a deal more successful.<br><b>Stanley Trevor</b><br>Nairn</p> <p>I, like other parents, am sickened and outraged at the vile level of cruelty perpetrated on innocent children. One of the reasons nothing changes is that these defenceless victims are not voters. Another is the total inadequacy of the bureaucratic social services system. Anyone fresh out of university with a degree in sociology can become a social worker. I would like to see a mothers' army of new recruits with a lower age limit of about 30, and without a single degree between them, get behind those closed doors. Will this Government get off its backside and swap bureaucracy for common sense?<br><b>Pat Smith</b><br>Worcestershire</p> <p>Whatever the rights and wrongs of social worker Lisa Arthurworrey's behaviour in the case of Anna Climbie, we shouldn't overlook the way Haringey's social services came through a joint review by the Audit Commission and HM Social Services Inspectorate with flying colours a few months earlier. None of the problems now widely publicised were flagged up in a way that would indicate the crisis levels which clearly exist and are now being cited as causal to this tragedy.</p> <p>Senior staff and ruling Labour councillors need to explain why they thought everything was fine when clearly this was a tragedy waiting to happen.<br><b>Lynne Featherstone</b><br> (Liberal Democrat) Leader of the Opposition Haringey Council</p>",

      "bodyText": "The comment by a social worker that Anna Climbie was smelly and disfigured, not a child that anyone would want to go near including some social workers, is appalling and explains why she was so neglected and died. That social worker is wrong. A child so described is exactly the child that anyone with any humanity, and indeed any intellect, would want to protect. Intellect tells us that every child of eight years old that smells of 'urine and faeces' is being neglected. Humanity does not reject disfigurement. The people who turned away from Anna thought only of themselves and had lost their focus on the child. It is at this level that changes need to be made to protect children. Margaret Laughton London SE27 Your reporting on the case of Anna Climbie omits one salient point. Lisa Arthurworrey, the young social worker involved, according to a report on television news, receives \u00a39,000 per annum, approximately equal to the weekly pay of a spotty-faced lager lout in the City of London. If the salary of social workers was trebled by a Government who thinks it a greater priority to waste billions on such fripperies as the Millennium Dome, perhaps a career in social services might appear attractive to persons of high calibre and recruitment could be a deal more successful. Stanley Trevor Nairn I, like other parents, am sickened and outraged at the vile level of cruelty perpetrated on innocent children. One of the reasons nothing changes is that these defenceless victims are not voters. Another is the total inadequacy of the bureaucratic social services system. Anyone fresh out of university with a degree in sociology can become a social worker. I would like to see a mothers' army of new recruits with a lower age limit of about 30, and without a single degree between them, get behind those closed doors. Will this Government get off its backside and swap bureaucracy for common sense? Pat Smith Worcestershire Whatever the rights and wrongs of social worker Lisa Arthurworrey's behaviour in the case of Anna Climbie, we shouldn't overlook the way Haringey's social services came through a joint review by the Audit Commission and HM Social Services Inspectorate with flying colours a few months earlier. None of the problems now widely publicised were flagged up in a way that would indicate the crisis levels which clearly exist and are now being cited as causal to this tragedy. Senior staff and ruling Labour councillors need to explain why they thought everything was fine when clearly this was a tragedy waiting to happen.

Shell has a Buddhist priest; Boeing offers study classes in the Torah, the Koran and the Bible. Spirituality and creativity - its more productive soulmate - are the latest buzz words, but are they any more than management-speak repackaged to squeeze that last ounce of blood from an overstretched workforce? </p> <p>Richard Reeves of the Industrial Society has been examining this trend for his forthcoming book, Happy Mondays. He says: 'Today's trendy management books all talk about spirituality at work. The sceptical view is that now business has our bodies and our minds, it wants our souls too.' </p> <p>For the board of Lotus Cars this meant reliving the battle of Agincourt. Former theatre director Richard Olivier uses the Shakespearean role in which his father was so acclaimed, Henry V, as a case study in leadership. 'I directed Henry V at the Globe,' says Olivier, 'and was interested by what a 400-year-old play had to tell us about leadership. Pilot course participants told me they'd learned more from Henry than from any management guru.' </p> <p>Now Olivier is on the way to becoming a guru himself. 'We don't just talk about ideas; we use the story to involve participants emotionally, and theatre skills to involve them physically.' </p> <p>Olivier, who also offers courses based on Julius Caesar and Hamlet, sees his work as part of an emerging arts-based type of training that is replacing the old adventure training model. 'Instead of dropping people in a field with a toothbrush, we drop them in the middle of Shakespeare,' he says. </p> <p>However, it is not just big corporate players that are interested in tapping into workers' creativity. A \u00a35 million Art's Council project has seen hundreds of businesses all over the country, including fish and chip shops, sewage farms and even Brighton and Hove Albion football club get their own artist in residence. </p> <p>'Point of Sale', a verse diary by poet Peter Sansom lyrically records his time as poet-in-residence for Marks &amp; Spencer. Unlike fellow poet David Whyte's workshops, Sansom's involve not reciting poetry, but writing it. </p> <p>'When I started doing this 15 years ago it was pretty rare in this country,' he says, 'Now it is becoming commonplace. At M&amp;S, I worked with people across the business - accountants, people who design soup labels, people on the shop floor - most of them would no more write a poem than hang-glide. Many of them expected me to read to them but instead we wrote - there and then.' </p> <p>Sansom describes the process as 'meditation with a finished product', adding: 'It brings things to the surface. Writing allows you to get to grips with what's troubling you, albeit indirectly.' </p> <p>What his work has in common with Olivier's and Whyte's is the use of metaphor. 'Someone may write a poem about a shoe that doesn't fit, but perhaps they're concerned about a job that doesn't fit,' Sansom says. 'Of course, you don't have to deconstruct it any more than you have to deconstruct a dream. However, just as you benefit from dreaming whether you deconstruct it or not, so you benefit from writing. Most people tell me they go back to their jobs feeling more awake and alive.' </p> <p>So tapping into our spiritual side at work may be natural and - as we spend more time at work in increasingly secular societies - necessary, but what does the company get out of it? Olivier is clear: 'The key skill managers need today is creativity - to manage change and apparent chaos. The arts can teach business a lot about this.' </p> <p>Whyte agrees. 'Every organisation wants vitality and adaptability in workers, and you can only get that if you unlock their creativity. The problem is the language of the workplace is not broad enough; the language of the arts and literature is.' Reeves welcomes any initiative that focuses on personal development. 'Our spiritual dimension is bound to impact on our work and the way we do it,' he says. </p> <p>'Cadbury's, for example, was founded on Quaker principles. The Industrial Society was started by a priest. More and more people are looking for work that fits the sort of person they are. That's good. But I worry when people try to train people in spirituality or standardise creativity. </p> <p>'It is clearly better for a firm to be a fun place to work, but you don't achieve that by sending everyone on a \"how to have fun\" course. The same is true of spirituality. You can't impose it.' </p> <p>Indeed, could it not be that for many people, an interesting job, a reasonable workload and a quiet room with time to sit and think may be all that is required to unlock their creativity? 'Once more unto the breach' may do it for some; once more unto the coffee machine for others. </p> <p><strong>Poetry and emotion</strong></p> <p>Poet David Whyte is not afraid to use a stream of Anglo-Saxon language in the management workshops he has put on for clients including Arthur Andersen and American Express. The eighth-century epic Beowulf is just one of 300 poems including 50 of his own that he recites, often by heart, to trigger off what he describes as 'a no bullshit conversation around creativity'. </p> <p> 'I avoid using the word spirituality because it provokes such allergic reactions. I prefer to talk about soul, and how you feel you belong to the world. Good leadership is at the frontier of this conversation. His workshops, which he runs on both sides of the Atlantic, encourage participants to 'live their own lives not someone else's'. </p> <p>Whyte, who has written four books of poetry, is not a natural friend of corporate America. 'I grew up in radical South Yorkshire and had a deep scepticism about the business world. I soon found that the business world had similar prejudices about poets. But I've discovered since I started doing this in 1986 that bringing together two things which don't usually go together creates a chemistry and this leads to all sorts of good stuff coming out. </p> <p>Whyte goes on: 'Many managers find they have left their original technical competency far behind and that most of their work involves structured conversation - something in which they have no training. That's where I can help.' </p> <p> Whyte believes that the best modern managers are what he calls 'apprentices in the phenomenology of human belonging'. He adds: 'At its simplest, people give more if they feel like they are more than cogs in a machine. More importantly, we spend more time at work than anywhere else - and if we're not asking the bigger questions about the soul at work, when are we going to do it?' </p> <p> Contacts: David Whyte - www.davidwhyte.com; <br>Richard Olivier - richardolivier@bt.internet.com; <br>Peter Sansom - edit@poetrybusiness.co.uk</p>",

According to a 'Thinkers 50' survey by management website FTdynamo.com, the stars of the burgeoning executive speaking circuit can earn $100,000 a day, putting them among the highest hourly earners on the planet. </p> <p>Deliciously, even anti-guru Scott Adams, creator of the cynical Dilbert cartoon, clears $15,000 for telling corporate audiences not to believe a word more orthodox colleagues say. </p> <p>Is it worth it? Most people would be sceptical. As the survey suggests, apparently 'new' ideas often turn out to be old ones in trendy (sometimes even non-existent) new clothes. Some are short-lived fads, and others are dubious or just plain wrong - they can't all be right, after all. </p> <p>But the issue is more complicated - and interesting - than that. Start from the fact that gurus past and present are hugely influential, if often at an unconscious level. Every large manufacturing company owes something to the thinking of FW Taylor and Henry Ford II, for instance. To paraphrase Keynes, every company is in thrall to some defunct management theorist. This conventional wisdom may be 'free', but that doesn't necessarily make it a bargain. </p> <p>Indeed, breaking out of the prison of past ideas may be cheap at any price. As Polaroid inventor Edwin Land once put it, moving forward is often due less to a blinding stroke of genius than 'a sudden cessation of stupidity ... not having a new thought, but stopping having an old one'. Some gurus (eg Tom Peters, No 5 on the list) fall into this category. </p> <p>But here's the next problem. Which way to go? One reason that gurus and their nostrums flourish is that, as another of their number (although not in the top 50), John Kay, points out, management is much like medicine in the mid-nineteenth century: some of it is known (routine operations, accounting and finance), but a lot is uncharted. There are plenty of assumptions but no accepted overarching theory. The corpus of management knowledge is a mixture of empirically researched hypothesis, inspired insight, guesswork and superstition - promising territory for the snake-oil salesman as well as the genuine doctor. </p> <p>The gurus are thus the embodiment of a burgeoning market for management ideas. In this perspective, the composition of the Dynamo list is striking. Although a few gurus are primarily theoretical (the influential Michael Porter, No 3) and another minority has successfully parlayed a single big idea into fame and fortune - Kaplan and Norton with the balanced scorecard (15), and, par excellence, Michael Hammer and James Champy with re-engineering (23) - the majority of the top 20 are firmly people-focused. </p> <p>Following the admirable Peter Drucker, whose balance of American optimism and European historical and political sensitivity is a lodestar for the entire discipline, Peters and Handy, Hamel and Prahalad, Mintzberg, Senge, Ghoshal, Bennis, Kanter, Ridderstrale and Nordstrom, Covey and Barnevik all view management through a people-focused lens. </p> <p>If anything, this trend is getting stronger. Ghoshal (12) and Bartlett, who began their influential work on multinationals by looking at top-level structures and processes, have over the years brought analysis down to the individual. They now argue not only that individual emancipation and empowerment are the corporation's bedrock sources of energy, but that they are a just and desirable cause in themselves. </p> <p>So that's all right, then? Well, not quite. If the most influential thinkers are impeccable humanists, how come so many of their consulting clients run companies that are oppressive to work in? One answer may be that the cacophony of competing guru sales pitches makes it hard to concentrate for long on any one. One short-term change programme succeeds another before the first has had a chance to prove itself. Some companies have have as many as 10 or 12 going on at the same time. </p> <p>Disillusion with one idea creates a market for an equal and opposite reaction. The downsizing abuses carried out in the name of re-engineering, for instance, were followed by a wave of books with titles like Healing the Wounds. The presence of Scott Adams and Dilbert on the list (31 - above Sir John Harvey-Jones) is testimony to a regrettable (to some) or healthy (to others) dose of cynicism among consumers. </p> <p>The preponderance of human-focused gurus could also (alas) be a variant on the 'people as most important-asset' syndrome - an expression of wish rather than reality, which has little traction when the going gets tough. Certainly, the two top practising businessmen in the list, Jack Welch and Bill Gates, didn't get where they are now by being nice. GE operates some unforgiving staff practices, and Bill Gates' contribution to management is brilliant technology strategy combined with equally cold-eyed use of share options. Europeans Percy Barnevik and Sir Richard Branson reflect a softer approach: but they are also less influential. Yet it would be hard to argue that the gurus were a force for evil rather than good. Although opportunists and charlatans exist, Warren Bennis' defence of fellow guru Tom Peters against a snide Fortune article rings true for many of the top 50: 'Peters has never given up his passion for a better, more humane, more respectful [not only to shareholders] corporate world.
