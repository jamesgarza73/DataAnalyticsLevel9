      "body": "<p>When a band has been away for nine years they cannot expect to waltz back into the premier league as though nothing has happened. Fortunately, no one has mentioned this to the Stereo MC's. They ambled on stage as that group who did the song from the mobile phones ad, the 52nd best band ever (according to Q magazine) and keepers of a flame most people thought went out when Noel Gallagher was still working for British Gas. By the time they ambled off, they were heroes. </p> <p>Pasty singer Rob Birch exuded a dilapidated charisma, doing a remarkable job of not being upstaged by the irrepressible Cath Coffey and the rest of the female front line. Nick Hallam stayed behind his keyboards, as faceless and hunched as a techno boffin, while drummer Owen If and percussionist Kwaku Dzidzornu laid down the sort of pummelling rhythmical bedrock many drum machine-laden dance acts can only dream about. </p> <p>The band sounded exactly the same as it always did. The MC's are masters of melodious swagger, producing finely chiselled, diamond-hard anthems that are effortlessly streetwise and yet curiously melancholy. Put simply, for all the seamless blending of hip-hop, funk, soul and rock'n'roll, and the goosebump-inducing vocal harmonies, this is just a fantastic pop group with fantastic pop songs. </p> <p>The newer tracks from the Deep Down and Dirty album were slightly anonymous, but that was perhaps inevitable, given the spine-tingling familiarity of the oldies. When the sound engineer applied the Connected vocal effect to Birch's voice during his introduction to that song, a tremor of anticipation shuddered through the auditorium. As the group blasted into the opening groove, the crowd went wild, energised by the sort of emotional escapism that ageing ex-Hacienda veterans remember with a tear. </p> <p>The performance was so infused with energy, the overall sound so sharp and contemporary, that it was impossible to accuse the band of coasting on nostalgia. They are clearly champing at the bit, and ready, one hopes, to stick around and be brilliant for a long while to come. Anyone looking for the greatest band in the world can stop right here - the Stereo MC's have moved from number 52 to number one overnight. </p> <p>\u0095 Stereo MC's are at Fabric, London EC1 (020-7336 8898), tonight. </p>",

They ambled on stage as that group who did the song from the mobile phones ad, the 52nd best band ever (according to Q magazine) and keepers of a flame most people thought went out when Noel Gallagher was still working for British Gas. By the time they ambled off, they were heroes. Pasty singer Rob Birch exuded a dilapidated charisma, doing a remarkable job of not being upstaged by the irrepressible Cath Coffey and the rest of the female front line. Nick Hallam stayed behind his keyboards, as faceless and hunched as a techno boffin, while drummer Owen If and percussionist Kwaku Dzidzornu laid down the sort of pummelling rhythmical bedrock many drum machine-laden dance acts can only dream about. The band sounded exactly the same as it always did. The MC's are masters of melodious swagger, producing finely chiselled, diamond-hard anthems that are effortlessly streetwise and yet curiously melancholy. Put simply, for all the seamless blending of hip-hop, funk, soul and rock'n'roll, and the goosebump-inducing vocal harmonies, this is just a fantastic pop group with fantastic pop songs. The newer tracks from the Deep Down and Dirty album were slightly anonymous, but that was perhaps inevitable, given the spine-tingling familiarity of the oldies. When the sound engineer applied the Connected vocal effect to Birch's voice during his introduction to that song, a tremor of anticipation shuddered through the auditorium. As the group blasted into the opening groove, the crowd went wild, energised by the sort of emotional escapism that ageing ex-Hacienda veterans remember with a tear. The performance was so infused with energy, the overall sound so sharp and contemporary, that it was impossible to accuse the band of coasting on nostalgia. They are clearly champing at the bit, and ready, one hopes, to stick around and be brilliant for a long while to come. Anyone looking for the greatest band in the world can stop right here - the Stereo MC's have moved from number 52 to number one overnight. \u0095 Stereo MC's are at Fabric, London EC1 (020-7336 8898), tonight.",

Headline inflation was expected to remain at around the government's target rate of 2.5% for the foreseeable future, so consumers must \"adjust their expectations\". \"Savers need to understand that low inflation means lower nominal returns.\" Sir Howard said it was important that consumers were not misled into thinking they could obtain high returns from low-risk investments. He singled out for criticism the new breed of individual savings accounts that invite small investors to put money into hedge funds, traditionally the preserve of the very rich. Two of the regulator's biggest headaches, mortgage endowments and the guaranteed annuity rates which landed Equitable Life in trouble, stemmed from the failure to adjust to lower inflation, he said. Low inflation protected the value of savings even though headline rates of return on investments were falling, Sir Howard said. In the late 1970s savers were receiving 15% on National Savings accounts. But that return had to be set against inflation which was running at 18% in 1980.Today, a return of 4.5% left investors better off in real terms.

Of course, the relationship may have broken down a little.</p> <p>PC rage is discovering increased popularity in the modern workplace. Swearing at your PC has always been good sport on the odd occasion, but now outbursts have started to get more frequent and more personal. </p> <p>The problem possibly began when we discovered - not what the pc can do, but what it can't. Customer care is based on two principles: finding out what the customer wants and giving it to them, and constantly exceeding expectations. </p> <p>The love affair with IT lasted only as long as it took us to learn exactly how to use it. Before that point we thought any inadequacies were down to our own stupidity. </p> <p>We believed that the PC was capable of anything and everything, from supplying a recipe for the perfect tarte tartin to giving us a step-by-step guide for world domination.</p> <p>Discovering it has its limits was sobering and a low moment in the customer care relationship. They dawdle. They crash. They deny access. They can be extremely non consumer-friendly. </p> <p>They are great for shopping, having a read, learning and researching. But they can make lousy time managers. Someone, somewhere, will one day compile a honest-to-goodness time log to discover whether they save or lose you time at work overall.</p> <p>Listening to a colleague new to email the other day, I was able to see the time-wastage aspect at source. This is a woman who would normally send three letters a week, and who would get her PA to write them. </p> <p>If she needed to contact someone urgently she would pick up the phone and have an immediate exchange of views. Now she is a slave to email. She is delighted to be able to send messages anywhere, any time. </p> <p>What she has failed to realise is that most of these are sent and received in the evening, from her home. Meaning that her work/life balance has turned very steeply in favour of the work option. Some go out as late as midnight. Some poor sod will find them on their screen first thing the next morning and then feel obliged to respond. One truly sad soul even wrote back at four minutes past midnight, on a saturday night.</p> <p>The secret is to review your PC work and ask the question \"why?\" a lot, as in \"why do I do this electronically?\" Does it save me time or create time? How much quicker and/or convenient is it for me to do it this way? Did I choose the electronic way or did I do it because of external nerd-pressure? </p> <p>Is it really easier for you to access your computer diary than a paper one? Would a letter or phone call be more appropriate than that email?

      "bodyText": "Does your PC give you relief or grief? It could cut a swathe through all those time-consuming admin chores and freeing your brain up for high-level thinking and decision-making. Of course, the relationship may have broken down a little. PC rage is discovering increased popularity in the modern workplace. Swearing at your PC has always been good sport on the odd occasion, but now outbursts have started to get more frequent and more personal. The problem possibly began when we discovered - not what the pc can do, but what it can't. Customer care is based on two principles: finding out what the customer wants and giving it to them, and constantly exceeding expectations. The love affair with IT lasted only as long as it took us to learn exactly how to use it. Before that point we thought any inadequacies were down to our own stupidity. We believed that the PC was capable of anything and everything, from supplying a recipe for the perfect tarte tartin to giving us a step-by-step guide for world domination. Discovering it has its limits was sobering and a low moment in the customer care relationship. They dawdle. They crash. They deny access. They can be extremely non consumer-friendly. They are great for shopping, having a read, learning and researching. But they can make lousy time managers. Someone, somewhere, will one day compile a honest-to-goodness time log to discover whether they save or lose you time at work overall. Listening to a colleague new to email the other day, I was able to see the time-wastage aspect at source. This is a woman who would normally send three letters a week, and who would get her PA to write them. If she needed to contact someone urgently she would pick up the phone and have an immediate exchange of views. Now she is a slave to email. She is delighted to be able to send messages anywhere, any time. What she has failed to realise is that most of these are sent and received in the evening, from her home. Meaning that her work/life balance has turned very steeply in favour of the work option. Some go out as late as midnight. Some poor sod will find them on their screen first thing the next morning and then feel obliged to respond. One truly sad soul even wrote back at four minutes past midnight, on a saturday night. The secret is to review your PC work and ask the question \"why?\" a lot, as in \"why do I do this electronically?\" Does it save me time or create time? How much quicker and/or convenient is it for me to do it this way? Did I choose the electronic way or did I do it because of external nerd-pressure? Is it really easier for you to access your computer diary than a paper one? Would a letter or phone call be more appropriate than that email? How long have you spent weeping over that crashed computer and how long would it have taken had you used an alternative? PCs are great but their use needs to be seen as limited. There are things we can do that we could not without them and there are jobs that are easier using an alternative medium. If in doubt, always ask yourself the classic time-management question: Is this the best use of my time, right now?",

On Wednesday most of the company took a turn centre stage and, during the course of the evening, demonstrated the entertaining mix of styles and personalities within Houston's ranks. </p> <p>Mauricio Canete, for instance (who plays the wimpy Ptolemy in Cleopatra), turned out to have a fast and fizzy technique, with brisk feet and a surprising scale for such a small dancer. Mireille Hassenboehler danced with an admirably grown-up self-possession and elegance. There was also a brief appearance from the company's star principal, Carlos Acosta (well-known to London through his appearances with the Royal Ballet), who performed ballet's equivalent of a rodeo in the pas de deux from Petipa's Diana and Acteon. </p> <p>Acosta, who has been with Houston since 1993, is a superb dance athlete - the dazzle with which he embellishes his enormous jumps is almost blinding. He also manages to combine classical grace with a spontaneous, ever so slightly louche charm. \"Feral\" has become Acosta's personal cliche - used a few times too many in his critical accolades - but he is without question a prince who's walked a little on the wild side. </p> <p>He danced on Wednesday with Lauren Anderson, who also has a big stage personality and an exuberant attack. Unlike Acosta, though, her energy lacks classical finish. A technique that was turned to feisty and exotic purpose in Cleopatra looked naive and a little ragged in the refined sophistication of Petipa. </p> <p>Diana and Acteon was a late addition to the programme and would have struck an oddly archaic note had the three new works looked more convincingly modern. It's a depressing feature of contemporary ballet-making that so few choreographers possess an idea that's original, let alone up to date (and if they do, they are rarely able to please their audience). Each of Houston's new ballets was actually a reworking of genres that have been playing on the international stage for years. </p> <p>Trey McIntyre's Second Before the Ground was by far the best of the bunch, featuring some arrestingly inventive movement.

And finally came Stanton Welch's Bruiser, a perkily upbeat juggling of sports motifs - mostly coy boxing moves and muscular jogging.

First produced by the company in 1994, Helen Edmundson's version of the story has taken a long time to reach the West End but it undoubtedly deserves its berth. It is devastatingly good. </p> <p>The great trick of the adaptation is that it never settles for the bare bones of narrative: it always gives you the emotional tenor of the story and always expresses the themes. Adapting from page to stage is almost always perceived as a second-rate art, but here it is elevated to something that is both true to the original novel and transcends it. But to talk about its being faithful is irrelevant - it is also completely of itself. When I first saw this production some years ago I had never read the novel but, as a result, I rushed out and bought it. Now I know the book intimately, but the stage version is as thrilling as ever. </p> <p>The vision is so complete that it is impossible to say where Edmundson's contribution ends and that of directors Nancy Meckler and Polly Teale begins. At its heart are the three Maggies, played by three actresses: First Maggie is the impetuous, wayward child, maybe her very soul; Second Maggie is the young woman who tries to suppress her nature so she can bow to the wishes of her domineering brother Tom; Third Maggie is the mature woman caught between the two as she struggles to reconcile her love for her cousin's beloved, Stephen Guest, with her need to do the right thing. Some of the best moments come when the struggle between the Maggies is most obvious. There is a lovely scene when Third Maggie is confronted by the knowledge of her love for Stephen while First Maggie creeps slyly around the edge of the piano, leading her on into dangerous waters. </p> <p>This is a dazzlingly acted production, where the boundaries between text and physicality become blurred as feelings are evoked with a swing on a rope or a sudden frozen image. In the rising floodwaters you don't just see but experience every mixed emotion of a woman trapped and doomed by the expectations of a society suspicious of an intelligent woman who thinks and feels too much for her own good. </p> <p>\u0095 Until May 5.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It could be the pitch for a socially minded reality TV show. Take a white kid and raise him in the gang-ruled black and Latino projects of New York City's Lower East Side. Not a tough kid, but a socially awkward one. Give him educated middle-class parents - a father of Mayflower stock and a Jewish mother - but poor, living on food stamps. Send him to a good school across town in Greenwich Village to provoke a heady contrast in his daily life, and see what he learns about race and class. </p> <p>Such is the strange-but-true life story of Dalton Conley, as his new memoir, Honky, will tell you. And as all good made-for-TV stories offer a dramatic epilogue, so does his story: he went on to become one of the hottest stars of the academy, studying - what else? - the sociology of race and class. Now, at 31, he has been poached from his position at Yale, seduced by New York University's promise of tenure and his own social research centre. </p> <p>He has penned a scholarly study of the connection between race and wealth called Being Black, Living in the Red, which argues that the foundation for class inequity between races is based on assets, not household income itself. For this he received accolades within both the academic and popular press. </p> <p>Conley has become a superstar by making connections between the field and the personal, or as the mission for his Centre for Advanced Social Science reads: linking academy to policy to community. And now, in Honky, he has mined his own life as a social science experiment. </p> <p>For all his academic success, Conley is hardly just another tweedy resident of the ivory tower. In his writing, as well as his classroom, Conley has a self-deprecating sense of humour and a hip set of cultural references. Case in point: he begins Honky with the epigraph: \"Your mother is so white she went to her own wedding naked\". His ease with humour, language, and the human world is what elevates him to the level of public intellectual. That skill, combined with what he admits is a \"Machiavellian\" focus on his career, is what makes Conley such a star. He can turn his award-winning Columbia dissertation into a praised book, write scholarly articles, convene symposia. But he can also synthesise the ideas behind his work in an honest and readable coming-of-age tale \"about literary truths, not scientific ones,\" he writes. </p> <p>Conley's story goes like this. His father and mother were living the 60s bohemian life on New York's Lower East Side. He was a painter, she was a writer. They were from families of some privilege and when space opened in Masyryk Towers, one of the projects that lay the foundation of the city's skyline, it seemed like a safe place to raise kids. This was long before crack, before news magazines ran cover stories on gangs, before the progressive housing experiments of the 60s and 70s had given way to the familiar American urban catastrophe of the 80s and 90s. Still, \"the steel door to our apartment was my security blanket,\" Conley writes. </p> <p>In Conley's view, \"learning class is like learning a language\". That education began when he was the only white kid enrolled in the local public school, where he quickly discovered skin privilege. At school, all the kids suffered corporal punishment , except for Conley. And privilege spared him another rod - that of New York's inequitable school system. Using a friend's address cross-town, Conley's parents sneaked him into a progressive school in Greenwich Village, where he felt as though he lived in another country. </p> <p>He lived as a chameleon, transforming his language and attitude on the cross-town bus as he shuttled from one world to another. The resultant awkwardness he thinks kept him away from the magnetic trap of gang life at Masyryk Towers (his best friend, a black boy named Jerome, was shot when a bullet ricocheted off one of those towering blocks). But it's easier not to play when nobody wants you on their team - and when other experiences - summers away at a lakefront cottage, afternoons in oak-panelled libraries, expectations of a college graduation - suggest that the game is played entirely differently elsewhere. </p> <p>This awareness hardly placed Conley solidly in the protected middle class, but instead in the cracks between comfort and poverty. \"If the exception proves the rule,\" Conley writes, \"I'm that exception.\" </p> <p>Certainly, after the Greenwich Village primary school, the exceptional rise gathered pace. He went on to one of New York's best high schools. Success in the sciences led to undergraduate work at Berkeley in California, then graduate work at Columbia, where his interest turned to the science of humankind. </p> <p>\"I wanted to write about homelessness,\" he says. But slowly, his own experience came to the fore. \"I was always interested in the disempowered, in the economically disadvantaged, but I didn't realise the autobiographical connections until later.\" That unique perspective, as well his academic prowess, led to a teaching position at Yale, before his new gig as NYU's social science wunderkind. </p> <p>It's a little hard to differentiate Conley from his students when he enters the lecture hall in NYU's grand main building. The social ineptitude seems years away as he strides in with easy charisma, confident in a huge puffy Spiewak ski parka in hip-hop-hooray silver. Standing before his class in a marble hall he begins doing for his students what he has done in his career - making the meaning of big ideas accessible by linking theory with the reality of personal experience. </p> <p>To illustrate this lecture about the sociology of the medical profession he shows a scene from the cerebral sci-fi movie, Gattaca. It's impossible not to make the connection between Conley's life and what appears onscreen - the story of an awkward kid whose life, like Conley's, was a form of social experiment. \"My real resum\u00e9 was in my [body] cells,\" says Ethan Hawke's protagonist. \"Now we have discrimination down to a science.\" </p> <p>Sitting behind his cluttered desk in a tiny office packed with social texts, Conley says what he's done doesn't differ greatly from what all academics do. \"I think that on an unconscious level all academics are trying to figure out their own experience through the method of science, where it's more comfortable, where you can rely on other sources for authority.\" </p> <p>Conley's experience also motivates the work of his centre, which coordinates academic outreach to kids from his old neighbourhood. But he says it may be time to leave the race-class dynamic debate behind: \"In some ways I feel like I have nothing to say on race any more. What else do I have to say after I've told my own story?\" </p> <p>But while he continues, in his role of public intellectual, to contribute ideas through media websites such as Salon and Feed, his next major project is also inspired by personal experience.

      "bodyText": "It could be the pitch for a socially minded reality TV show. Take a white kid and raise him in the gang-ruled black and Latino projects of New York City's Lower East Side. Not a tough kid, but a socially awkward one. Give him educated middle-class parents - a father of Mayflower stock and a Jewish mother - but poor, living on food stamps. Send him to a good school across town in Greenwich Village to provoke a heady contrast in his daily life, and see what he learns about race and class. Such is the strange-but-true life story of Dalton Conley, as his new memoir, Honky, will tell you. And as all good made-for-TV stories offer a dramatic epilogue, so does his story: he went on to become one of the hottest stars of the academy, studying - what else? - the sociology of race and class. Now, at 31, he has been poached from his position at Yale, seduced by New York University's promise of tenure and his own social research centre. He has penned a scholarly study of the connection between race and wealth called Being Black, Living in the Red, which argues that the foundation for class inequity between races is based on assets, not household income itself. For this he received accolades within both the academic and popular press. Conley has become a superstar by making connections between the field and the personal, or as the mission for his Centre for Advanced Social Science reads: linking academy to policy to community. And now, in Honky, he has mined his own life as a social science experiment. For all his academic success, Conley is hardly just another tweedy resident of the ivory tower. In his writing, as well as his classroom, Conley has a self-deprecating sense of humour and a hip set of cultural references. Case in point: he begins Honky with the epigraph: \"Your mother is so white she went to her own wedding naked\". His ease with humour, language, and the human world is what elevates him to the level of public intellectual. That skill, combined with what he admits is a \"Machiavellian\" focus on his career, is what makes Conley such a star. He can turn his award-winning Columbia dissertation into a praised book, write scholarly articles, convene symposia. But he can also synthesise the ideas behind his work in an honest and readable coming-of-age tale \"about literary truths, not scientific ones,\" he writes. Conley's story goes like this. His father and mother were living the 60s bohemian life on New York's Lower East Side. He was a painter, she was a writer. They were from families of some privilege and when space opened in Masyryk Towers, one of the projects that lay the foundation of the city's skyline, it seemed like a safe place to raise kids. This was long before crack, before news magazines ran cover stories on gangs, before the progressive housing experiments of the 60s and 70s had given way to the familiar American urban catastrophe of the 80s and 90s. Still, \"the steel door to our apartment was my security blanket,\" Conley writes. In Conley's view, \"learning class is like learning a language\". That education began when he was the only white kid enrolled in the local public school, where he quickly discovered skin privilege. At school, all the kids suffered corporal punishment , except for Conley. And privilege spared him another rod - that of New York's inequitable school system. Using a friend's address cross-town, Conley's parents sneaked him into a progressive school in Greenwich Village, where he felt as though he lived in another country. He lived as a chameleon, transforming his language and attitude on the cross-town bus as he shuttled from one world to another. The resultant awkwardness he thinks kept him away from the magnetic trap of gang life at Masyryk Towers (his best friend, a black boy named Jerome, was shot when a bullet ricocheted off one of those towering blocks). But it's easier not to play when nobody wants you on their team - and when other experiences - summers away at a lakefront cottage, afternoons in oak-panelled libraries, expectations of a college graduation - suggest that the game is played entirely differently elsewhere. This awareness hardly placed Conley solidly in the protected middle class, but instead in the cracks between comfort and poverty. \"If the exception proves the rule,\" Conley writes, \"I'm that exception.\" Certainly, after the Greenwich Village primary school, the exceptional rise gathered pace. He went on to one of New York's best high schools. Success in the sciences led to undergraduate work at Berkeley in California, then graduate work at Columbia, where his interest turned to the science of humankind. \"I wanted to write about homelessness,\" he says. But slowly, his own experience came to the fore. \"I was always interested in the disempowered, in the economically disadvantaged, but I didn't realise the autobiographical connections until later.\" That unique perspective, as well his academic prowess, led to a teaching position at Yale, before his new gig as NYU's social science wunderkind. It's a little hard to differentiate Conley from his students when he enters the lecture hall in NYU's grand main building. The social ineptitude seems years away as he strides in with easy charisma, confident in a huge puffy Spiewak ski parka in hip-hop-hooray silver. Standing before his class in a marble hall he begins doing for his students what he has done in his career - making the meaning of big ideas accessible by linking theory with the reality of personal experience. To illustrate this lecture about the sociology of the medical profession he shows a scene from the cerebral sci-fi movie, Gattaca. It's impossible not to make the connection between Conley's life and what appears onscreen - the story of an awkward kid whose life, like Conley's, was a form of social experiment. \"My real resum\u00e9 was in my [body] cells,\" says Ethan Hawke's protagonist. \"Now we have discrimination down to a science.\" Sitting behind his cluttered desk in a tiny office packed with social texts, Conley says what he's done doesn't differ greatly from what all academics do. \"I think that on an unconscious level all academics are trying to figure out their own experience through the method of science, where it's more comfortable, where you can rely on other sources for authority.\" Conley's experience also motivates the work of his centre, which coordinates academic outreach to kids from his old neighbourhood. But he says it may be time to leave the race-class dynamic debate behind: \"In some ways I feel like I have nothing to say on race any more. What else do I have to say after I've told my own story?\" But while he continues, in his role of public intellectual, to contribute ideas through media websites such as Salon and Feed, his next major project is also inspired by personal experience. It's an exploration of sibling differences and dynamics, in which he'll investigate how birth order, genetic predisposition and other factors determine how siblings have disparate experiences in the world. He has long been fascinated with the dynamics that join and separate him from his sister; now he's seeing that play re-enacted by his two young kids. \"I think I'm trying to understand my own family from a different angle,\" he says.

      "body": "<p>A major outbreak of tuberculosis - which may turn out to be one of the biggest in the UK since the disease was brought under control in the 1980s - has been identified at a secondary school in Leicester.</p> <p>Last night public health officials said 24 cases of TB have been confirmed, 20 of them children at Crown Hills community college and one a teacher. About 700 children, aged 11 to 14, have been screened and of those a further 60 look likely to have been infected with the disease.</p> <p>\"This is a major outbreak,\" said Gerry Bryant, specialist registrar in public health with Leicestershire health authority. \"I'm not aware of a published outbreak of this size in a school. We believe it might be part of a larger community outbreak. It is very difficult to tell at this stage.\"</p> <p>Dr Philip Monk, consultant on communicable disease control at the health authority, blamed the outbreak on a particularly virulent strain of the disease that is spreading rapidly.</p> <p>Thousands of children may potentially have to be screened if it is thought the disease had spread. \"We may be looking at six primary schools that feed into Crown Hills community college. That would be 2,000-2,500 pupils as a starting point. Then there are around 3,000 pupils from secondary schools,\" Dr Monk said.</p> <p>It is highly unusual to get a significant number of cases in a school because generally, children tend to be infected not by each other but by very close contact with adults, usually members of their family.</p> <p>There will certainly be more cases to come. Every child and teacher in the school will now be screened. Not every person who develops TB is infectious, but some of the Crown Hills children have proved to be so, and so the disease may well have spread within their families. All those infected have been given the standard course of antibiotic TB treatment, and the 60 who had strongly positive skin-prick tests, indicating likely infection, have been given a shorter course to keep the disease at bay.</p> <p>The outbreak began when one child in year nine developed TB last August. Ninety-three per cent of the children at the school are of Asian origin and it is possible the child became infected on a visit to India, where TB is endemic. The second case, in October, involving a child in the same class, was discovered when the first child's close contacts were screened. When a third child in the class developed TB last month, it was decided to mount a major screening exercise.</p> <p>For Gary Coleby, headteacher of the school in inner-city Leicester, the news of the rising numbers is a blow. Its Ofsted report before Christmas said it was one of the best urban schools in the country. And for three years running it has been one of the government's top 200 improving schools. Mr Coleby is trying hard to reassure everyone that it is business as usual.</p> <p>\"The original three children diagnosed have all been treated and are all back at school,\" he said. \"The parents are concerned but they are being kept very closely informed about what is going on and they are involved in the process so they know what is happening. We do have a lot of parental support here and it is now paying dividends.</p> <p><b> New strains</b><br></p> <p>\"The most important message is that there is no panic and the school is operating absolutely as normal, although with some disruption because of the screening.\"</p> <p>Sixty years ago, this outbreak would have been a disaster and a tragedy, because TB was a regular killer, but the BCG vaccination, together with better drug treatment, surveillance and meticulous follow-up of all the contacts of anyone with the infection have made deaths unnecessary.</p> <p>But nobody takes tuberculosis lightly. The number of cases in the country is rising among people who are born abroad or whose parents were. TB is killing millions in south-east Asia, Africa and eastern Europe - and is frequently the direct cause of death of those whose immune systems have been damaged by HIV.</p> <p>But what alarms public health officials most is the onward march of new strains of TB which are resistant to the antibiotic drugs most used to treat the disease. Unless the disease can be brought under control elsewhere in the world, increasing numbers of multi drug-resistant TB (MDRTB) cases will arrive in the UK. They are hard - and expensive - to treat. The Crown Hills college outbreak is not MDRTB, but it has arrived from abroad and all the vigilance of the public health officials has not been able to prevent it.</p> <p>The finger was immediately pointed at the absence of the BCG vaccination programme in schools. Many parents have voiced anxieties at the temporary halt to vaccinations two years ago which was caused by a shortage of vaccine.</p> <p>Less than two weeks ago, on World TB Day, the government announced that the BCG vaccination programme for schoolchildren would be restarting. In London, which has more TB cases than anywhere else, vaccinations for 13-year-olds have already started again. There is a cohort of children who have been missed, some of whom may be about to leave school and, potentially, travel to countries where TB is endemic. Those, the government has said, will receive a catch-up vaccination in the summer.

      "bodyText": "A major outbreak of tuberculosis - which may turn out to be one of the biggest in the UK since the disease was brought under control in the 1980s - has been identified at a secondary school in Leicester. Last night public health officials said 24 cases of TB have been confirmed, 20 of them children at Crown Hills community college and one a teacher. About 700 children, aged 11 to 14, have been screened and of those a further 60 look likely to have been infected with the disease. \"This is a major outbreak,\" said Gerry Bryant, specialist registrar in public health with Leicestershire health authority. \"I'm not aware of a published outbreak of this size in a school. We believe it might be part of a larger community outbreak. It is very difficult to tell at this stage.\" Dr Philip Monk, consultant on communicable disease control at the health authority, blamed the outbreak on a particularly virulent strain of the disease that is spreading rapidly. Thousands of children may potentially have to be screened if it is thought the disease had spread. \"We may be looking at six primary schools that feed into Crown Hills community college. That would be 2,000-2,500 pupils as a starting point. Then there are around 3,000 pupils from secondary schools,\" Dr Monk said. It is highly unusual to get a significant number of cases in a school because generally, children tend to be infected not by each other but by very close contact with adults, usually members of their family. There will certainly be more cases to come. Every child and teacher in the school will now be screened. Not every person who develops TB is infectious, but some of the Crown Hills children have proved to be so, and so the disease may well have spread within their families. All those infected have been given the standard course of antibiotic TB treatment, and the 60 who had strongly positive skin-prick tests, indicating likely infection, have been given a shorter course to keep the disease at bay. The outbreak began when one child in year nine developed TB last August. Ninety-three per cent of the children at the school are of Asian origin and it is possible the child became infected on a visit to India, where TB is endemic. The second case, in October, involving a child in the same class, was discovered when the first child's close contacts were screened. When a third child in the class developed TB last month, it was decided to mount a major screening exercise. For Gary Coleby, headteacher of the school in inner-city Leicester, the news of the rising numbers is a blow. Its Ofsted report before Christmas said it was one of the best urban schools in the country. And for three years running it has been one of the government's top 200 improving schools. Mr Coleby is trying hard to reassure everyone that it is business as usual. \"The original three children diagnosed have all been treated and are all back at school,\" he said. \"The parents are concerned but they are being kept very closely informed about what is going on and they are involved in the process so they know what is happening. We do have a lot of parental support here and it is now paying dividends. New strains \"The most important message is that there is no panic and the school is operating absolutely as normal, although with some disruption because of the screening.\" Sixty years ago, this outbreak would have been a disaster and a tragedy, because TB was a regular killer, but the BCG vaccination, together with better drug treatment, surveillance and meticulous follow-up of all the contacts of anyone with the infection have made deaths unnecessary. But nobody takes tuberculosis lightly. The number of cases in the country is rising among people who are born abroad or whose parents were. TB is killing millions in south-east Asia, Africa and eastern Europe - and is frequently the direct cause of death of those whose immune systems have been damaged by HIV. But what alarms public health officials most is the onward march of new strains of TB which are resistant to the antibiotic drugs most used to treat the disease. Unless the disease can be brought under control elsewhere in the world, increasing numbers of multi drug-resistant TB (MDRTB) cases will arrive in the UK. They are hard - and expensive - to treat. The Crown Hills college outbreak is not MDRTB, but it has arrived from abroad and all the vigilance of the public health officials has not been able to prevent it. The finger was immediately pointed at the absence of the BCG vaccination programme in schools. Many parents have voiced anxieties at the temporary halt to vaccinations two years ago which was caused by a shortage of vaccine. Less than two weeks ago, on World TB Day, the government announced that the BCG vaccination programme for schoolchildren would be restarting. In London, which has more TB cases than anywhere else, vaccinations for 13-year-olds have already started again. There is a cohort of children who have been missed, some of whom may be about to leave school and, potentially, travel to countries where TB is endemic. Those, the government has said, will receive a catch-up vaccination in the summer. Government policy is that children born in TB endemic areas, or whose parents or grandparents were born there, should be vaccinated at birth. Those who come to live in the UK should be vaccinated on arrival. The vast majority of Crown Hills' 1,200 pupils have been protected from TB, but unfortunately the BCG is only 60 to 70% effective and the strain that has hit the school appears to be particularly virulent. Ironically, what has happened in Leicester underlines the limited usefulness of the schools vaccination programme, which is coming under review in a few years' time and which there may be moves to end. \"There has been discussion in the medical press about how much benefit is achieved by the schools programme,\" said John Watson, a consultant epidemiologist at the Public Health Laboratory Service. \"You have to vaccinate an awful lot of children to prevent a single case of TB. It is not comparable to the childhood vaccination programmes against measles, for instance.\" What is TB and how is it spread? What kind of disease is tuberculosis? Contagious, caused by a bacteria that attacks the lungs, although it can also target the lymph nodes, bones and occasionally the brain. How common is it? It used to be very common in the UK. Known as consumption in Victorian times, it claimed the lives of many poets and writers, notably Keats. There were 50,000 cases a year in the 1940s, which dropped to 5,000 in the late 80s, rising to just below 7,000 now. This is nothing compared to Africa, eastern Europe and south-east Asia.

Children, the elderly and the frail or immuno-compromised are at greatest risk. Before pasteurisation, TB could be contracted from milk from cows infected with bovine TB. Does everybody who comes into contact with TB bacteria get the disease? No. One third of all people are estimated to carry the bacteria, but only one out of 10 of them will develop TB.

      "bodyText": "A regime of bullying and intimidation at Westminster Abbey choir school has been exposed in a confidential report to the school by the local authority. The 31 page report, a copy of which has been seen by the Guardian, details complaints by parents of pupils and former pupils at the school and undermines attempts by the abbey to claim the school has been the subject of criticisms only by an unrepresentative minority. It paints a picture of pupils living under a fierce disciplinary regime in which toys were limited, comics and music centres banned and contact with home severely restricted. The school's headmaster, Roger Overend, was forced out in February after a draft copy of the report, which has since been amended, was shown to the dean of the abbey, Wesley Carr, who is also the school's chairman of governors. The famous 37 pupil choir school is the only school in the country providing education exclusively for choristers. But it has recently been racked by controversies beginning with the dean's decision to sack the former organist, Martin Neary, in 1998. It has suffered a recruitment crisis with only four boys attending auditions for up to 12 places. The report, by Westminster city council's social services department, follows a detailed inspection last autumn, which included 11 visits by a three person team over eight days. The report warns that significant concerns were raised about the welfare of the children and that a further visit will take place before the end of the summer term. The school has refused to publish the report, though it has circulated copies to parents. While acknowledging that most parents were happy with the administration, it said: \"A significant number of parents, choristers and staff have raised concerns about the conduct of the headmaster. These concerns included intimidation through shouting, threats, the tape recording of a conversation with a chorister, humiliation through name calling, gestures and actions, inequality in the treatment and use of disciplinary measures applied to individual choristers.\" It said these were not isolated incidents and added: \"Concerns relating to choristers are roughly proportional to the length of time they have been at the school and have been raised at earlier times with the headmaster and dean.\" When the Guardian first published details of parental concerns about the school and Mr Overend's behaviour in December, the abbey claimed the critics were unrepresentative. It added that social services had been conducting a regular inspection and had not as far as the governors were aware found any case of bullying. The dean's support for the headmaster was withdrawn two months later when he was called to a meeting and asked to resign. According to those present at a parents' meeting last week held to discuss the report, Mr Overend, who is the stepfather of two boys at the school, claimed he had effectively been sacked and placed the blame on parents whom he named. A comment by the school at the end of the report said Mr Overend left for personal reasons and that his resignation was accepted with regret. The report claimed that Mr Overend had been given too much responsibility over decision making and had been subject to excessive stress. It conceded that educational standards were high.",

      "body": "<p>The third weekend of June was the hottest of last year. In the UK and across northern Europe temperatures climbed into the high 30s, and in Rotterdam, Holland, the sun beat down on football fans attending Euro 2000.</p> <p>The great harbour city was still reeling from the party that followed a Dutch victory on Friday evening, and come Sunday June 18 the fine weather was a convenient excuse for more chilled beer. For 60 Chinese illegal immigrants however, huddled in the back of a sealed container lorry in a warehouse in the city's docks, the heat was to prove devastating.</p> <p>Ke Su Di, 20, was among them. A delivery boy from Fujian, he had left his family home just 11 days previously. His parents had paid a Snakehead smuggling gang \u00a34,000, the first instalment of a \u00a320,000 fee - equivalent to 10 years wages - to get him to the UK.</p> <p>When he left his head was full of dreams of prosperity, both for himself and his parents. Now, dressed in three layers of clothing to avoid carrying luggage, he squatted in the container and waited for the last leg of the journey to get under way. He can have had no idea that he would be one of only two to leave the lorry alive.</p> <p>The group had gathered around 2.30 that afternoon, travelling from safehouses to the warehouse in Waalhaven, a section of Rotterdam's harbour. Inside was a white 1995 Mercedes truck hooked up to an 18 metre container, its refrigeration unit long broken.</p> <p>As well as the 60 Chinese, half a dozen other men were present including a lorry driver and petty criminal called Perry Wacker, who helped the Chinese board the lorry. Had Ke or the others looked up as they climbed into the darkness they might have seen a pink teddy bear, incongruously hanging from the rafters. It would have been the last thing most of them saw clearly, save for the bodies of their colleagues.</p> <p>Once all 60 were aboard, four containers of water were passed up, and a stack of tomato boxes were loaded by Wacker and others into a specially built frame at the rear of the container.</p> <p>Using sign language, Wacker pointed out a small vent on the left hand side of the trailer which was to be their only source of light and air. When this was open, he indicated, they should talk only quietly. When it was closed, as it would be at some point, they should remain silent. Then the doors closed.</p> <p>Shortly before 3pm Wacker climbed into the cab and set out for Zeebrugge. He arrived at the ferry terminal around 6pm, 90 minutes before the ferry was due to depart. At 7pm he was waved forwards to board the European Pathway, a P&amp;O freight-only ferry bound for Dover. The time had come for total secrecy.</p> <p>Wacker untied the rope with which the air vent had been held open, forced the small door closed, and went in search of his dinner. With this act he sealed his cargo's fate. Inside Ke Su Di saw Wacker's hand reach up, then blackness.</p> <p>Inside the container the 56 men and four women baked. They discarded layers of clothes until many were bare chested, finished the water then desperately sucked at the tomatoes for moisture.</p> <p>The stagnant air inside the lorry was slowly turning to carbon dioxide; every breath poisoned the atmosphere. Some inside began to pound the side of the lorry and shout, more interested now in survival than secrecy.</p> <p>\"People began to panic because the window was shut and there was no air,\" Ke Su Di told Maidstone crown court.</p> <p>\"Some people removed tomatoes and wanted to kick open the doors. There was a lot of shouting and screaming but noone came to help.\" By the time the European Pathway docked at Dover at 11.30pm everyone but Ke Su Di and Ke Shi Guang, 22, was dead.</p> <p>The first thing the search team noticed as they swung open the rear doors of the container was the heat. Sensing something wasn't right, a senior officer looked over the tomatoes and shouted into the container, \"Hello, hello\".</p> <p>He heard a small noise, then silence. \"lllegals, I think they might be in trouble,\" he called to his colleagues. Two dock workers were summoned and they were the first into the container. One of them, Barry Betts, saw what he thought was a pile of palettes. In fact, it was \"a sea of bodies\".</p> <p>As his eyes adjusted to the darkness, he heard moaning and watched as Di and Guang struggled to free themselves from under the weight of the dead.

      "bodyText": "BBC Worldwide boss Rupert Gavin is being eyed up by Carlton Communications for its vacant head of content job. It is believed he is top of the \"love list\" of candidates the company has drawn up as a possible new head of content. The job was created last year as part of the streamlining that led to the dramatic departure of Lord Alli. Insiders at the ITV giant have confirmed they are poised to approach the former BT executive who is believed to have clashed with BBC director general Greg Dyke. Carlton Communications refused to comment on the reports that emerged at MipTV in Cannes this week. A BBC Worldwide spokeswoman said: \"There have been no talks between Rupert Gavin and Carlton.\" It is said Mr Gavin's relationship with Mr Dyke has become strained over deciding the future strategy for BBC Worldwide. Mr Dyke is said to want a greater say in how Worldwide operates, while under previous director general Sir John Birt Mr Gavin was used to more autonomy. The director general is thought to believe the public service part of the BBC should have more say in how its programming rights are exploited commercially, rather than simply handing the rights over to Worldwide and letting it get on with it. Mr Dyke is also understood to want to cut Worldwide's overheads to increase its profitability. The future direction of the BBC's commercial arm is being thrashed out as part of a review that was due to have been completed earlier this year. One cost-cutting option said to be under consideration is to scrap Worldwide's global marketing brand development division, which is headed by Jeff Taylor. GMBD was set up in 1998 to introduce a more multimedia, marketing led approach to exploiting BBC brands around the globe. The division can point to successes such as Teletubbies and Tweenies. But critics argue that outside children's programmes there are relatively few properties that have the potential to become Teletubbies-style cross-media and merchandising blockbusters. They believe the multimedia marketing operation should be scaled back to concentrate on children's properties. In other areas, it is thought Worldwide may revert to its old system of organising its activities into TV distribution, publishing and merchandising licensing. The review is expected to be completed by May. In the longer term, Mr Dyke is also thought to be considering turning Worldwide into more of a licensing operation, farming activity such as making toys and publishing books based on BBC programmes to third parties. This is another point of difference with Mr Gavin, who has favoured expanding Worldwide's activities, into making Tweenies toys for instance. Relevant stories Click here for latest BBC news",

Now they realise prison officers have a part to play in child protection.\" There are more than 200 men convicted of sex offences against children in Wandsworth prison. \"When you've got that number of sex offenders in one place, there is an awful lot of information sloshing around,\" said Mr Landy. Part of the job of the project is helping prison officers pick up and recognise that information and, just as importantly, pass it on to the relevant child protection agencies. \"Our main achievement is that we have encouraged prison officers to communicate with social services departments,\" said Mr Landy. \"Prison officers have become part of the child protection system.\" Earlier this month, the project won the Lord Woolf award from the Butler Trust, which recognises creative work undertaken in the prison service. Mr Landy praised the governor of Wandsworth for recognising the potential of the project but is campaigning for the same practices to get taken up in institutions around the country. \"Prison governors are required to protect children,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, how it's done across the prison system is very piecemeal. There are other prison establishments where it just isn't happening.\"",

Yahoo! has been reeling from a dire profit warning and a series of management resignations, but today's deal has provided some much-needed relief. The company's shares rose 25% in early trading in New York after it confirmed that it would distribute the Duet music service co-owned by Vivendi Universal and Sony. Duet will be a direct rival to the MusicNet venture launched by AOL Time Warner, EMI, Bertelsmann and Real Networks earlier this week. Vivendi and Sony provide nearly 40% of the world's music sales, and Yahoo!'s massive customer base will give the companies access to millions of music fans worldwide. Today's deal means that the world's five largest music companies have signed up to services designed to counter rogue internet sites such as Napster and Gnutella. The deal also marks Vivendi's first major US distribution deal. Related story Apr 2: Music giants join forces to rival Napster",

You arrive at the hospital, torn between dread and hope, to discuss with the consultant whether he or she thinks your Down's syndrome baby is suitable for heart surgery. There will have been examinations and tests and finally you are there, sitting across the table with your stomach churning waiting for the verdict. Then somebody - perhaps a nurse, perhaps the consultant - puts a tape recorder on the table and turns it on. </p> <p>This is the recommendation of the inquiry into the treatment of Down's syndrome children at the Royal Brompton hospital in London. The inquiry found that doctors who declined to operate to mend the holes in the hearts of Down's children had not meant to discriminate against them, but that in failing to go the extra mile and pursue all the options for them, that was effectively what they did. </p> <p>The parents have been outraged. So hurt and appalled are they that tape recording consultants - to get the evidence if there is bias or a bad judgment - must feel like a good idea. If only they had secreted a machine in a jacket pocket, there would have been no argument. Perhaps they could have got the guilty party sacked. That's how you feel when things have gone wrong. Some of the parents whose babies were sent for heart surgery at the Bristol Royal Infirmary and did not survive, at a time when some doctors were aware that the hospital's success rates were unacceptably low, may feel the same. </p> <p>But what does that tape-recorder on the table do to the conversation between consultant and parent? It puts a barrier of suspicion between them. That tape says that the patient does not trust the doctor. It may also come to say that the doctor does not trust the patient. It's a step further towards the sort of litigation culture that prevails in the US. The doctor is not going to have a full and frank conversation with the parent - he or she is going to say what they know they can defend in court. </p> <p>The sort of \"key consultations\" the inquiry report has in mind are emotional affairs and they need to be. Parent and doctor both usually care passionately about the fate of the child. That needs to be let out. There has to be trust and there has to be an exchange of feelings. How will that happen with the tape going round and round and somebody occasionally checking to make sure the red recording light is still on? </p> <p>Tape recorders are the tools of the police interview. They are not suitable for the consulting room. But the fact that an inquiry can think they might be is a devastating indictment of the state we are in. Huge improvements in communication need to be made and trust in doctors needs to be rebuilt. More openness is needed, less paternalism and encouragement to parents and patients who want a second opinion. Tape recorders will make many doctors shut up like clams. They are not the answer. </p> <p>To HRT or not to HRT. The question becomes increasingly difficult. A recent study has shown that women who take hormone replacement therapy in the shape of oestrogen for 10 years have an increased risk of ovarian cancer. In fact, their death rate from it was twice that of women who had not taken oestrogen. </p> <p>But the numbers are still small. The Cancer Prevention Study in the US recruited 1.2m women, of whom 944 had died within a decade from ovarian cancer. But it's a particularly nasty cancer because survival chances are not good. </p> <p>This isn't the only risk now recognised in taking HRT. Taking oestrogen alone, without progestin, increases the risk of endometrial cancer - cancer of the lining of the womb. It can also lead to bloodclots and gallstones. Last year it was also found that taking combinations of hormones for several years increases the risk of breast cancer. </p> <p>But there are health advantages to taking HRT. Not only does it relieve the menopausal symptoms of hot flushes and sleep disturbances, but oestrogen can help prevent the bone-thinning of osteoporosis. Several studies have found that it also reduces deaths from heart disease. </p> <p>So what should women of a certain age do? It's a tough one. The official line is that they should weigh up the risks and benefits of their own case, but there will always be an element of uncertainty. It's not a good situation for the anxiety-prone. </p> <p>The latest study from the US may increase women's alarm, but at least it is good to know that the effects of HRT are still being studied. Huge numbers of women are now taking it, but as with any long-term medication, they are effectively taking part in an experiment. It may be as well to remember that.</p>",

      "body": "<p>I am slowly recovering from a lumbar laminectomy - the partial removal of a disc from the lower spine. The surgeon visited me every day, while I was in hospital, to look at my impressive sacral scar. He hoped he had carried out an operation to cure me. It was, for me, the last resort after three years of back problems; but for the man who was in the room next door, it had been 15 years of excruciating pain. </p> <p>Perhaps I have wimped out too early. No one seems to think back surgery is a good idea except the surgeons themselves. </p> <p>My problem was that none of the people I saw about my back ever spoke to each other. It was not that there was a communication wall between private and public healthcare or a thick beanstalk between conventional and alternative medicine. There was simply no dialogue, and so each new referral felt like going back to the beginning. </p> <p>It all started nearly three years ago, when I was on holiday in Portugal and woke up with slight back ache. It is not unusual to have back pain from soft hotel beds, so I carried on lifting the cases, driving and dancing. However, that slight lumbar tension worsened when I returned home, so I went to see a physiotherapist. </p> <p>She did the usual manoeuvring of limbs, knees to chest and lots of massage. The back felt more relaxed, but the tightness and spasms had returned by the next morning. I saw her about 10 times until someone recommended another physiotherapist. I never saw the first one again. She must presume I am better. </p> <p>Like hairdressers who ask, rather dismissively, who cut your hair last, the new physio was not impressed with her predecessor's exercises. Now it was twisting knees while in the crucifix position and more violent clicks of my hips. After several unsuccessful sessions I returned to my GP who then sent me away for an x-ray. It was confirmed that I had early-onset osteoarthritis of the spine. Put simply, this means that the cartilages of the joint and bone begin to wear away - along with any hopes I have of improving . </p> <p>The prescribed tablets made no difference. The pain in my back grew more severe and my legs ached, so I went to see a homeopath. He diagnosed compression of the lower spine and gave me comfrey tea as well as drops of alchemilla after every meal. I woke up the next day with no pain at all. Alternative medicine was the answer. I toasted myself with a glass of comfrey tea, but the pain returned the following afternoon. </p> <p>I went to see the homeopath again. He clicked my neck and gave me some glucosamine, more drops and some very expensive Chinese tablets. The pain and muscular spasms were worse than ever. I never saw him again, except on the television. I don't know if he thinks he cured me. </p> <p>Next on the consultation trail was a specialist in cranial osteopathy. While treating me, she said she could see a white dog dancing at my feet. Then a masseuse came to the house. She covered me in extract of St John's wort. I had to take all my clothes off which rather shocked my wife. </p> <p>The following week, now finding it difficult to move, I returned to more conventional medicine with a visit to a renowned lumbar specialist. He diagnosed ankylosing spondylitis, a severe arthritis of the spine, but he suggested I had a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan at a private clinic. He declined my offer of speaking to the physio or the osteo or the homeopath. </p> <p>The scan revealed that I had a large centrally-prolapsed disc between vertebrae L4 and 5. He was pleased with the diagnosis and said that a couple of sessions at a good physiotherapist should do it. If not, I might have to consider keyhole surgery. I went to his recommended physio, but my legs, by this stage, were almost constantly numb, with tingling sensations in my feet and no feeling in my toes. The sessions consisted of a quick look at my back and 25 minutes of her attempts to salvage a broken relationship on a mobile phone which rang incessantly to the tune of Love Story. I told her I was going on holiday. I do not know if she put a tick by my name. </p> <p>My GP was also on holiday. The locum doctor was very concerned and could not understand how the osteoarthritis stated on my record card could lead to leg numbness. Did I feel pins and needles in my saddle? I wasn't sure. If I did, I was to call the emergency department immediately. This is the first sign of loss of bladder and bowel control. That night, at about 3am, I felt pins and needles everywhere, in my saddle, my withers, my stirrups and in my cruppers. My wife drove me to another specialist. </p> <p>At last. He understood about the prolapsed disc. He looked at the MRI scan and told me I would get better, but it would take time. I saw him twice a week for a month or so and then every fortnight for two years. I was more flexible and not in constant pain, but as soon as I began to feel better, I felt worse again. </p> <p>He was very much against me having an operation, having treated many failures from surgery. When the pain was acute, he advised me to put a cold compress on my back. The previous physio had suggested a hot flannel: the one before that had recommended alternating hot and cold. </p> <p>In addition, I was having acupuncture once a week for pain management, shiatsu in my lunch breaks, visits to solar ray therapists, reflexologists, spiritual healers and retching on the twice-daily tincture of St John's wort, horsetail, black cohosh, licorice, skullcap and valerian concocted by my herbalist sister. </p> <p>With this amalgam of remedies, physiotherapy, osteopathy, hot, cold, better, worse, light and darkness, I finally decided to see my first neurosurgeon. Surgeons are doctors of comparatively few words, whose hands shake less when they give you bad news. \"You must have an operation,\" he said. \"This prolapse is too severe to resolve in any other way.\" </p> <p>I continued with my complementary treatments for several months and saw another surgeon for a second opinion. He looked at the same scans all the others had seen, but claimed my spine was a disaster waiting to happen. He said that I needed an implanted nylon rod, fixed into the base of the spine as well as a discectomy (removal of the offending disc). I just wanted two people to agree, any two people, so decided to see one last neurosurgeon. </p> <p>The last one agreed with the first one and so I found myself lying in room 26, staring at the cylinders and tubing surrounding my hospital bed. Most of my get well soon cards had infirm animals on them: a frog sucking a large thermometer, a crocodile with a bandage over one eye and rabbit with only one ear. </p> <p>Illness needs fluffy tails, without the fur: the sick are a grim bunch. Grimmer than that are those who do not get well soon, but who hang around, wincing and snapping at their well-meaning loved-ones. </p> <p>Where or when did it all go wrong? I really tried everything, NHS and private, alternative and conventional, I even put toothpaste on my back one night and prayed before I went to bed, only to wake up to another day with minted sheets. </p> <p>My employers have been very supportive and sympathetic, but for the past few years I have been recruited into a new job, one I share with thousands of others: I have had a career in being unwell and it takes up all my time. </p> <p>I have to ask whether my situation would have been so bad had the main audience of my affliction communicated with each other. They could have held a conference about me at Earl's Court, maybe, with posters of my MRI scans on the wall and flyers detailing the treatments already received. </p> <p>My GP knows nothing about my operation and must imagine that, when I did not return to see her after the brief consultation in 1999, that I've recovered. </p> <p>Christopher Columbus went to his death in 1506, believing that he had discovered Asia.

      "byline": "Laura Barton",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Celebrity Bodies is 92 pages long, with around 500 words a page. The average number of calories burned whilst reading is one every minute. Reading Celebrity Bodies from cover-to-cover will probably burn up around 18.5 calories, maximum. Indeed the only pounds you're certain to lose through reading this latest publication from the Emap stable are those in the cover price of \u00a31.65. </p> <p>The magazine's launch, last week, caused uproar. Tessa Jowell, the minister for women dubbed it \"grim\". From tabloids to broadsheets, everyone was up in arms at the unpalatable concept of an entire magazine devoted to the wacky fitness regimes of the stars. How could any publishing company be so downright irresponsible as to launch a magazine eulogising almost skeletally-thin idols such as Victoria Beckham? </p> <p>Alison Hall, co-editor, denied that the magazine would encourage unhealthy behaviour. \"People want nice bodies and I don't think that it is immoral for us to cater for that,\" she said. But then yesterday it all got worse: pictures of Geri Halliwell, cover girl on the first edition of Celebrity Bodies, looking frighteningly gaunt on the front page of the Mirror. Proof positive that the diets celebrated in Celebrity Bodies are not a good thing. </p> <p>Actually, in the flesh, Celebrity Bodies is a bit of a relief. It's a more refreshing read than Zest, or any of the other health and beauty glossies pedalling their wares with the sort of clear-skinned smugness reserved for the over-tofu-ed. A spokeswoman for the British Nutritional Foundation (BNF) remarks on its tongue-in-cheekness. \"I think it's good that they've been upfront,\" she says. And she's right. Celebrity Bodies is tremendously funny. </p> <p>Seemingly written by a bunch of slightly pudgy wannabes, who maybe eat a M\u00fcllerlite yoghurt from time to time, and once flailed around on the living room floor and called it yoga, they'll stick in the odd wry comment - instructing Jennifer Aniston to \"push the boat out, girl\" when it's claimed that she'll even sometimes allow herself to eat pretzels, in moderation. </p> <p>But it's true that the mag does give detailed guidance on the gamut of mad celeb diets, from the high-protein, low-carbohydrate \"zone\" diet favoured by the likes of Jennifer Aniston and Minnie Driver, to the \"blood-type\"diet followed by actress Martine McCutcheon. </p> <p>The zone diet involves stuff like sausages and fruit juice for breakfast (no toast, natch), warm chicken salad for lunch and a poached salmon fillet and mixed salad for supper. All pretty yummy-sounding, but in minute quantities, of course. The blood-type diet involves eating only foods which are compatible with your blood type. (Type Os, for example, should steer clear of cabbage. You have been warned.) </p> <p>Then there's the living food for health diet - a lot of detoxing and salad - and of course the diet which seems to have reduced Geri to matchstick proportions: apparently a macrobiotic diet designed by \"yoga guru Kisen\", whoever she or he is. It's your run-of-the-mill no-meat, no-dairy, no-caffeine, no-alcohol diet. Brilliant fun. Breakfast might be 100g of porridge, followed by a hearty lunch of pumpkin soup (300ml) and then a tofu stir-fry for dinner. Recipes all included, but if this is all Geri eats, it's hard to see why she's been spotted at meetings of Overeaters Anonymous. </p> <p>\"People know this isn't the way to lose weight,\" says our spokeswoman for the BNF. \"They're unsustainable, you either end up giving up or putting the weight back on.\" </p> <p>But is it really true that people know \"this isn't the way to lose weight\"? There's evidence that dieting doesn't work - that it only leads to a life of dieting, with your weight going up, down, up down - but do young women actually realise this? That simply restricting your calories can mess with your head and appetite for good? In fact, that dieting will probably make you fat? </p> <p>The statistics suggest an emphatic not: right now around 40% of British women are trying to diet. It's a fair guess that most of them have a pretty unhealthy relationship with food and aren't going to stop dieting when they've squeezed into their Christmas party dresses. And the unpleasant truth is that obsessive dieting of this kind may well damage both their health and their happiness. </p> <p>Countless studies show that repeated dieting makes you more likely to get heart disease, gallstones, diabetes, anaemia, cancer, and osteoporosis. It can give you lank hair, sallow skin and dull eyes, make you depressed and, crucially, perilously fat. </p> <p>Last year a study published by the American Psychological Association showed that drastic weight-loss efforts (dieting, exercise, appetite suppressants, laxatives, and vomiting) in teenage girls make them more likely to become obese later in life. Those who don't try to lose weight tend to find it easier keeping off the weight. And recently the American-based National Institutes of Health found that almost 98% of all dieters not only regain the lost weight, but put on more. </p> <p>In 1995, Oxford University researchers discovered that dieting could actually disturb your brain chemistry. The result is a loss of control over eating that could underlie both yo-yo dieting and clinical eating disorders such as bulimia nervosa. </p> <p>The team found that dieting lowered the blood concentration of an amino acid, tryptophan, the main ingredient for making the brain messenger serotonin. Basically, the message is clear: diets can be dangerous. </p> <p>And will images in the media - pictures of the super-thin such as Victoria Beckham - and details of their diets actually influence anyone? \"I would say there's an association between media images and eating disorders,\" says the BNF spokeswoman. \"But it is something which has come through all sorts of problems - low self esteem, abuse ...\" </p> <p>Steve Bloomfield from the Eating Disorders Association (EDA) is less tolerant: \"Research shows that dieting doesn't work.

      "bodyText": "Celebrity Bodies is 92 pages long, with around 500 words a page. The average number of calories burned whilst reading is one every minute. Reading Celebrity Bodies from cover-to-cover will probably burn up around 18.5 calories, maximum. Indeed the only pounds you're certain to lose through reading this latest publication from the Emap stable are those in the cover price of \u00a31.65. The magazine's launch, last week, caused uproar. Tessa Jowell, the minister for women dubbed it \"grim\". From tabloids to broadsheets, everyone was up in arms at the unpalatable concept of an entire magazine devoted to the wacky fitness regimes of the stars. How could any publishing company be so downright irresponsible as to launch a magazine eulogising almost skeletally-thin idols such as Victoria Beckham? Alison Hall, co-editor, denied that the magazine would encourage unhealthy behaviour. \"People want nice bodies and I don't think that it is immoral for us to cater for that,\" she said. But then yesterday it all got worse: pictures of Geri Halliwell, cover girl on the first edition of Celebrity Bodies, looking frighteningly gaunt on the front page of the Mirror. Proof positive that the diets celebrated in Celebrity Bodies are not a good thing. Actually, in the flesh, Celebrity Bodies is a bit of a relief. It's a more refreshing read than Zest, or any of the other health and beauty glossies pedalling their wares with the sort of clear-skinned smugness reserved for the over-tofu-ed. A spokeswoman for the British Nutritional Foundation (BNF) remarks on its tongue-in-cheekness. \"I think it's good that they've been upfront,\" she says. And she's right. Celebrity Bodies is tremendously funny. Seemingly written by a bunch of slightly pudgy wannabes, who maybe eat a M\u00fcllerlite yoghurt from time to time, and once flailed around on the living room floor and called it yoga, they'll stick in the odd wry comment - instructing Jennifer Aniston to \"push the boat out, girl\" when it's claimed that she'll even sometimes allow herself to eat pretzels, in moderation. But it's true that the mag does give detailed guidance on the gamut of mad celeb diets, from the high-protein, low-carbohydrate \"zone\" diet favoured by the likes of Jennifer Aniston and Minnie Driver, to the \"blood-type\"diet followed by actress Martine McCutcheon. The zone diet involves stuff like sausages and fruit juice for breakfast (no toast, natch), warm chicken salad for lunch and a poached salmon fillet and mixed salad for supper. All pretty yummy-sounding, but in minute quantities, of course. The blood-type diet involves eating only foods which are compatible with your blood type. (Type Os, for example, should steer clear of cabbage. You have been warned.) Then there's the living food for health diet - a lot of detoxing and salad - and of course the diet which seems to have reduced Geri to matchstick proportions: apparently a macrobiotic diet designed by \"yoga guru Kisen\", whoever she or he is. It's your run-of-the-mill no-meat, no-dairy, no-caffeine, no-alcohol diet. Brilliant fun. Breakfast might be 100g of porridge, followed by a hearty lunch of pumpkin soup (300ml) and then a tofu stir-fry for dinner. Recipes all included, but if this is all Geri eats, it's hard to see why she's been spotted at meetings of Overeaters Anonymous. \"People know this isn't the way to lose weight,\" says our spokeswoman for the BNF. \"They're unsustainable, you either end up giving up or putting the weight back on.\" But is it really true that people know \"this isn't the way to lose weight\"? There's evidence that dieting doesn't work - that it only leads to a life of dieting, with your weight going up, down, up down - but do young women actually realise this? That simply restricting your calories can mess with your head and appetite for good? In fact, that dieting will probably make you fat? The statistics suggest an emphatic not: right now around 40% of British women are trying to diet. It's a fair guess that most of them have a pretty unhealthy relationship with food and aren't going to stop dieting when they've squeezed into their Christmas party dresses. And the unpleasant truth is that obsessive dieting of this kind may well damage both their health and their happiness. Countless studies show that repeated dieting makes you more likely to get heart disease, gallstones, diabetes, anaemia, cancer, and osteoporosis. It can give you lank hair, sallow skin and dull eyes, make you depressed and, crucially, perilously fat. Last year a study published by the American Psychological Association showed that drastic weight-loss efforts (dieting, exercise, appetite suppressants, laxatives, and vomiting) in teenage girls make them more likely to become obese later in life. Those who don't try to lose weight tend to find it easier keeping off the weight. And recently the American-based National Institutes of Health found that almost 98% of all dieters not only regain the lost weight, but put on more. In 1995, Oxford University researchers discovered that dieting could actually disturb your brain chemistry. The result is a loss of control over eating that could underlie both yo-yo dieting and clinical eating disorders such as bulimia nervosa. The team found that dieting lowered the blood concentration of an amino acid, tryptophan, the main ingredient for making the brain messenger serotonin. Basically, the message is clear: diets can be dangerous. And will images in the media - pictures of the super-thin such as Victoria Beckham - and details of their diets actually influence anyone? \"I would say there's an association between media images and eating disorders,\" says the BNF spokeswoman. \"But it is something which has come through all sorts of problems - low self esteem, abuse ...\" Steve Bloomfield from the Eating Disorders Association (EDA) is less tolerant: \"Research shows that dieting doesn't work. And yet the media is trying to sell another publication focusing on dieting methods. The EDA would question whether aspiring to other people's bodies is appropriate\". Of course it is vastly inappropriate. But Celebrity Bodies does at least has the boldness to be honest, and indeed witty, about it, rather than hiding behind the pretence of health and wellbeing and vitality. It's the last page of the magazine which says it best, poking a finger in the skinny ribs of the stars. The \"What diet are you on then?\" page includes the \"Pleeeease take a photo of me diet\" (for the half-dressed lovelies outside the film premieres) and the \"Damn she's thinner than me diet\" (for the cast of Ally McBeal).

It acknowledges that we all want to be thin. But also that we all like pies. \u0095 A debate at the Institute of Psychiatry tonight will discuss eating disorders and the media.

This perennially contentious issue returned to stoke up the diplomatic temperature on Wednesday when the Japanese education ministry approved a controversial new history textbook that Seoul, Beijing and Pyongyang claim glosses over atrocities by the imperial army in the first half of the twentieth century. Drawn up by the Japanese Society for History Textbook Reform - a group headed by right-wing academics and politicians - the new book makes no mention of the Japanese army's use of \"comfort women\", the euphemism for the hundreds of thousands who were forced into prostitution in government-run frontline brothels. It also plays down the severity of the Nanking Massacre, stating that there are reasons to doubt the Tokyo War Tribunal's judgement that the Japanese army killed a large number of Chinese civilians after occupying the city in 1937. Although the education ministry's screening panel insisted on more than 100 changes to tone down the original text, China and South Korea say the final 337-page version continues to justify Japan's aggression from 1910 to 1945. As soon as the book was approved, the South Korean government summoned the Japanese envoy to Seoul to express its \"deep concerns\" and to warn that introduction of the text in schools would threaten bilateral relations. China's Xinhua news agency criticised the teaching material for \"distorting historical facts and glorifying wars of aggression\". Anti-Japanese fury in Beijing would not have been eased by the fact that the US reconnaissance plane that was forced to land in Hainan flew from Okinawa. Former comfort women who joined a protest outside the Japanese embassy in Seoul issued a statement accusing Japan of hiding from the truth. \"It is an unforgivable sin to turn one's face away from past atrocities while many of the victims are still suffering from the abuse they endured.\" The textbook dispute comes amid growing fears that as the region becomes more polarized, Japan is moving once again to sanitise its wartime history.

In the late 1920s, it was hard for a serious-minded young actress who was not arrestingly pretty to get a training in the classics, which was the only way to get on without backstage influence. </p> <p>Born in Eastbourne of a Scottish family, she grew up in Guildford. After training at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, her first professional role was on a 50-week tour of Many Waters, alongside a fellow RADA student, Robert Morley. After a stint in rep at Cambridge, where the director was Peter Powell, whom she later married, she landed the part of the mother in an Irish revival by the Gate Theatre Company, Dublin, of Eugene O'Neill's Ah, Wilderness! which visited the West End in 1936. When the company returned to Dublin, Anderson joined it for three years as leading lady. </p> <p>In the 1940s, Anderson found herself working at London's Players Theatre Club, then in King Street, Covent Garden, now under Charing Cross Station, where so many other theatrical luminaries (notably Peter Ustinov) first got their footing in the theatre. Anderson enjoyed the atmosphere, camaraderie and hard work of the so-called Late Joys and had a gift for the kind of satirical, nostalgic material which continues to be sung in tribute to the Victorian music hall. She became so popular that during the absence of Leonard Sachs, the legendary founder and co-director with Peter Godfrey of the Players, she proved a most stirring substitute. </p> <p>Whether in the West End or provinces, or with the newly subsidised National Theatre or Royal Shakespeare Company, she made her mark, however briefly, in plays by Rattigan or Fry, Chekhov or Ibsen, Ben Travers or EM Forster, Somerset Maugham or William Douglas Home, Jean-Jacques Bernard or Frank Wedekind - and in particular as Mme Rosamunde in Les Liaisons Dangereuses for the RSC, in which she went to Broadway (1986). </p> <p>Was there a likelier Charley's Aunt (for the same company) or a haughtier dowager in Travers' Corkers End (at Guildford) or a funnier Dame Maud Gosport (looming but listing squiffily) in Rattigan's send-up of actor-managers, Harlequinade? They were typical examples of her familiar character work. </p> <p>Anderson's quiet authority, vocal poise and invisible technique saw her safely through countless parts on stage, screen and television. In the 1950s and 1960s she juggled with all three mediums simultaneously, lending her dependably distinctive gallery of cousins, aunts, mothers, nurses, policewomen, social workers, teachers and officials to the big screen in A Town Like Alice, Heart of a Child, Lucky Jim, The Barretts of Wimpole Street, Spare the Rod, The Inspector, Half a Sixpence, Country Dance and The Lady Van ishes, as well as to the theatre and television. </p> <p>It was the small screen, however, which seemed to bring out the best in her art; perhaps because it had more scope for the kind of kindly if sometimes curt characterisation to which Anderson brought such a compelling restraint. My favourites are still the stoic Mum in The Railway Children, the awful matriarch in The Brothers, the series about a road haulage company, and the eccentric old gambler in Trainer. </p> <p>In its elegance, observation, timing and emotional insight, another gem was Molly Cowper, the ageing English social snob in Julian Mitchell's Survival of the Fittest. Herself as old as the 80-year-old character, Anderson brought out all the private suffering, loneliness, intransigence and maternal possessiveness of an old lady who refused to acknowledge reality. </p> <p>Among scores of other \"types\" which she turned into individuals for the small screen were Jocelyn Holbrook in Tenko, the series about the experiences of European women interned by Japanese militia, Mrs Fortescue in Keeping Up Appearances, Mrs Spencer Ewell in House of Elliot, Dr Goldrup in GBH, Lady Anne in Do Not Disturb, the Dowager in Circles of Deceit, Belle in Campion, Great Aunt Anne in Evelyn Waugh's Scoop, Jo March in Little Women, and Frau Buddenbrook in Buddenbrooks. Her final television role came last year in Samuel Beckett's Endgame, back at the Gate Theatre, Dublin. </p> <p>Her marriage to Peter Powell ended in divorce.

CA Research &amp; Testing Centre officer Roy Booker said viewers simply did not know the distinctions between digital and analogue TV. Consumer confusion is one of the biggest enemies of the government's blueprint for broadcasting in Britain. If insufficient quantities of consumers buy digital TV, the government cannot switch off a single analogue TV transmitter. Technological journalist and broadcaster Barry Fox slammed the government's handling of the analogue switch-off as \"a shambles\". At a Voice of the Listener and Viewer conference today he called for a digital TV tsar to \"shake up this bunch of incompetents\". He said: \"There is a mish-mash of shared responsibility with no chain of command to get this show on the road. \"People need to be persuaded to switch over.\" The conference applauded electronic programme guides, the TiVo personal video recorder service, wider programme choice, better Teletext services, internet and email access.

      "bodyText": "Dutch lorry driver Perry Wacker was today sentenced to 14 years in jail for the manslaughter of 58 Chinese immigrants found dead in his lorry at Dover after he closed the only air vent and they suffocated to death. Mr Justice Alan Moses, sitting at Maidstone crown court, also sentenced Wacker's fellow defendant Ying Guo, of South Woodford, Essex, to six years for conspiring to smuggle illegal immigrants into the UK in June last year. The 60 Chinese would-be illegal immigrants - there were just two survivors - endured several weeks of arduous travel before making their fateful attempt to enter Britain. They were escorted in small groups from China by snakehead minders after agreeing to pay a criminal gang \u00a320,000 each to smuggle them into this country. The journey of the 56 men and four women started in China's capital city Beijing, from where they flew by plane to the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade. They travelled legally on Chinese passports after obtaining permits to leave the People's Republic. During the journey the immigrants' minders forced them to wear black trousers and grey T-shirts, and were issued with a code number, so they would not be picked up by rival gangs. When they arrived in Belgrade they were taken to safe houses and given stolen Asian passports, mainly Korean. From there, still in small escorted groups, they were taken by car over the border and into Hungary. They were transported through Austria and into France hidden in the backs of vans, then boarded a train in France to get to the Netherlands, where they were handed over to the European side of the network, in Rotterdam. The two survivors of the journey, Su Di Ke, 20, and Ke Shi Guang, 22, met at Fujian airport on June 7 and were flown to Beijing. Mr Ke told the jury at the trial that he left the Chinese capital with 15 other immigrants and two snakehead minders. After being smuggled across Europe his group was taken to a safe house in Rotterdam. Other immigrants were already there, awaiting their chance to get into Britain. The court heard that on June 18 the Dutch gang took the 60 immigrants in two delivery vans - 27 in one vehicle and 33 in the other - to a warehouse in the Waalhaven area of Rotterdam. They Dutch gang members loaded them into the front of the lorry container, then used three pieces of wood to make a partition before stacking boxes of tomatoes between them and the lorry doors, to conceal their presence. When they left Rotterdam the air-vent on the side of the trailer was tied open with a piece of string, and the Chinese were given four buckets of water to last the journey. Mr Ke said: \"Once the water was inside it was finished quickly. I did not have time to get any.\" Wacker drove the lorry to Zeebrugge, leaving at 3pm and arriving just after 6pm. Before reaching the Belgian port he stopped at a motorway service station, bought four cans of soft drink and closed the air-vent to avoid his human cargo being spotted at immigration checks. After paying cash for a ticket for the crossing, Wacker queued to get on to a P&amp;O Stena Line ferry. The immigrants were trapped inside the airtight container on one of the hottest days of last summer until the lorry was searched at Dover at 11.43pm. After parking the lorry on the ferry Wacker went upstairs, where he tucked into a meal and watched two films. Mr Ke said his fellow passengers were calm until the air started running out. \"They started panicking after about two to three hours because the vent was shut and there was no air. Some people removed tomatoes and tried to kick open the doors. There was also a lot of shouting and screaming, but nobody came to help.\" Mr Guang burst into tears while recalling the crossing in court.

      "body": "<p>\"We always thought we had a dead duck of a name,\" admits David Millar, chief executive of the charity, which until the end of March, was called Understanding Industry.</p> <p>The charity was set up 23 years ago to offer students an insight into the world of work. It receives high-level business support from blue chip companies and is well respected in schools. </p> <p>However, research among stakeholders suggested that people liked the work of the charity but thought its image was dull and uninspiring. Roger Taylor, a brand strategist who conducted the rebranding of the charity said: \"We discovered that there are people who have enjoyed a seminar but couldn't remember the name of the organisation which provided it.\" </p> <p>Other problems were the word \"understanding\", which was deemed patronising, and students' image of industry, which was associated with \"chimney stacks and pollution\". </p> <p>One teacher in the research said: \"It simply has to be more upbeat, glamorous and fun.\"</p> <p>But Mr Millar didn't want a cosmetic change. \"It is more than fiddling around with pantone colours, we wanted to convey a more high-tech, entrepreneurial image of industry.\" The charity is also using more innovative methods to reach a wider audience. Later this year it will be launching an interactive computer game, which involves students launching and managing a virtual music band. \"We wanted to show that we were more dynamic,\" added Mr Millar. </p> <p>Mr Taylor explains that the charity then set about defining its position in the market place. \"Our next step was to define the target audiences, as the first stage towards getting the positioning and the communications right for each of them.\"</p> <p>The charity defined its raison d'etre as \"opening the eyes of students to the world of business\". It then developed this definition into a mission statement by identifying its role for each of its target audience.</p> <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p> <p>For students: it should be an inspiring source of knowledge, direction and life skills at a crucial stage in their lives</p> <p>For corporate sponsors: it should champion the interests of the business world to the younger generation</p> <p>For the government: it demonstrates their support for business and enterprise</p> <p> Establishing brand values was the next task on the 'to do' list. From the research, the charity concluded it needed to be:<br> \u0095 Young<br> \u0095 Forward-looking<br> \u0095 Dynamic<br> \u0095 Empowering<br> \u0095 Fun<br> \u0095 Innovative<br> \u0095 Creative<br> \u0095 Modern<br> \u0095 Colourful</p> <p>Mr Taylor said: \"Defining these provides guidelines for anyone creating communications about the organisation. At the same time, and equally important, it tells staff how they should behave, how they should deliver the brand.\"</p> <p>The baton was then handed over to the creative team to incorporate the findings of the research and the ideas on positioning into a new name, logo and slogan.</p> <p>The team came up with 50 suggestions for names but only 10 of them were available.

      "bodyText": "\"We always thought we had a dead duck of a name,\" admits David Millar, chief executive of the charity, which until the end of March, was called Understanding Industry. The charity was set up 23 years ago to offer students an insight into the world of work. It receives high-level business support from blue chip companies and is well respected in schools. However, research among stakeholders suggested that people liked the work of the charity but thought its image was dull and uninspiring. Roger Taylor, a brand strategist who conducted the rebranding of the charity said: \"We discovered that there are people who have enjoyed a seminar but couldn't remember the name of the organisation which provided it.\" Other problems were the word \"understanding\", which was deemed patronising, and students' image of industry, which was associated with \"chimney stacks and pollution\". One teacher in the research said: \"It simply has to be more upbeat, glamorous and fun.\" But Mr Millar didn't want a cosmetic change. \"It is more than fiddling around with pantone colours, we wanted to convey a more high-tech, entrepreneurial image of industry.\" The charity is also using more innovative methods to reach a wider audience. Later this year it will be launching an interactive computer game, which involves students launching and managing a virtual music band. \"We wanted to show that we were more dynamic,\" added Mr Millar. Mr Taylor explains that the charity then set about defining its position in the market place. \"Our next step was to define the target audiences, as the first stage towards getting the positioning and the communications right for each of them.\" The charity defined its raison d'etre as \"opening the eyes of students to the world of business\". It then developed this definition into a mission statement by identifying its role for each of its target audience. Examples: For students: it should be an inspiring source of knowledge, direction and life skills at a crucial stage in their lives For corporate sponsors: it should champion the interests of the business world to the younger generation For the government: it demonstrates their support for business and enterprise Establishing brand values was the next task on the 'to do' list. From the research, the charity concluded it needed to be: \u0095 Young \u0095 Forward-looking \u0095 Dynamic \u0095 Empowering \u0095 Fun \u0095 Innovative \u0095 Creative \u0095 Modern \u0095 Colourful Mr Taylor said: \"Defining these provides guidelines for anyone creating communications about the organisation. At the same time, and equally important, it tells staff how they should behave, how they should deliver the brand.\" The baton was then handed over to the creative team to incorporate the findings of the research and the ideas on positioning into a new name, logo and slogan. The team came up with 50 suggestions for names but only 10 of them were available. Mr Taylor warned: \"It is vital to check that domain names are available as well as charity names.\" The team narrowed the selection down to businessdynamics. Mr Taylor explains: \"The word 'business' communicates immediately the organisation's area of operation - and it covers all kinds of companies. 'Dynamics' has two important meanings - what makes something work and the sense of energy, we thought this was a good combination.The slogan, 'bringing business to life for students' was added to encapsulate what the charity does.\" The logo, which is a stylised \"b\" and \"d\", was designed to look like two faces talking to each other as well as a computer connector. Mr Taylor said: \"When you are designing a logo, you have to design it with the internet in mind, which means it must be capable of animation.\" The charity's website illustrates this capacity. And finally the charity went back to the stakeholders for their verdict. \"We all held our breath in case the students would reject it and we would have to start all over again,\" explained Mr Taylor. Fortunately, they liked it and Understanding Industry was consigned to the graveyard and businessdynamics was born. Mr Millar concluded: \"Don't change your name for the sake of it and don't do it lightly and seek professional guidance.\" Mr Taylor added: \"Rebranding should revitalise a charity and give staff a new sense of purpose as well as giving it a competitive edge.\"",

A Palestinian security chief, Mohammed Dahlan, called the shooting an Israeli assassination attempt. His car, a silver Mercedes, was hit by seven bullets. Mr Dahlan and other senior officials were returning to Gaza after a meeting with the Israelis at the home of the US ambassador to Israel, Martin Indyk. The peace talks are the highest level meeting to take place between the two sides since Ariel Sharon became prime minister two months ago. The Palestinian delegation said the talks were \"difficult\" and no agreement was reached. Raanan Gissin, a spokesman for Mr Sharon, said the talks \"may be a dead end, but I don't know. We'll have to see.\" The Palestinians demanded that Israel remove its restrictions on their movements, withdraw its tanks and stop the targeted killing of Palestinian activists.

In exuberant biographies he was depicted as impervious to human pain and weakness. \"Lenin cannot be killed! So long as the proletariat lives - Lenin lives!\" one of his hagiographers declared. </p> <p>So it came as something of a blow to learn on January 21 1924 that Lenin had in fact died. The mundane details of the prolonged illness that left him paralysed and barely able to speak were glossed over in the official reworkings of his life. Instead devoted party artists and sculptors laboured for decades to brand a triumphant, healthy image of the revolutionary leader on the minds of the masses. </p> <p>Now that the Soviet imagery of Lenin has been toppled, the last agonised months of his life have been reclaimed for public consumption. This is the subject of Alexander Sokurov's new film, Taurus, recently shown to a small Moscow audience in preparation for its Cannes debut. For the first time in Russian cinema the reverence demanded by the creators of Lenin's personality cult has been abandoned. In place of adoring respect, there is harsh realism - only not the socialist variety. The 53-year-old Lenin is shown as a broken figure, crazed, rambling and unable to recognise even the distinctively sinister figure of Josef Stalin. </p> <p>At the start of the film, the invalid is shown naked, half-wrapped in a sheet. We see him carried into his bath and tended to by his dreadful, downtrodden, hag-like old wife, who later retires to a back room to scrub his greying underwear by hand. We even witness his toenails being clipped as he lies writhing in his sickbed. </p> <p>If Sokurov had made this film 15 years ago it would have joined six more of his earlier works, locked forever in a censor's cupboard. He would probably have been arrested, he says, before it progressed beyond the screenplay. But Moscow's cultural climate has changed so comprehensively that such an irreverent work prompted not even a stirring of outrage. Critical commentary has focused exclusively on the film's cinematographic qualities; its political content has been shrugged off as irrelevant. </p> <p>This is not merely revisionism, a logical, predictable antithesis to the dozens of admiring biopics created by the hero directors of Soviet cinema. The screenplay does not aim to demonise Lenin: Taurus is a strangely neutral portrayal of an unpleasant, ailing old man, focusing on his human failings and his personal disappointments. Sokurov does not want the film to be seen as a corrective postscript to the canon of official works. \"This is not a political documentary, I wasn't trying to make a political point. This is a film about a person like us,\" he says. </p> <p>Taurus is the second film in Sokurov's planned quartet about the 20th century's most powerful rulers. The first, Moloch, was a human portrayal of Hitler at home with Eva Braun in his last weeks in power. In both works, Sokurov focuses on the intense dissatisfaction experienced by the leaders as they reflect on what they have achieved. \"These are people whose lives have not worked. These were deeply unhappy human experiences - from childhood to the last days of their lives. Both attempted to change the world by violently interfering with people's lives. Neither achieved his ends,\" he says. \"I feel very sorry for them.\" </p> <p>The echoing empty halls of the Gorky estate form the sad backdrop to the last days of Lenin's life. Behind every door a soldier hovers, observing him. The invalid has been told the telephone no longer works; newspapers are confiscated. In a moment of semi-lucidity Lenin is horrified by the grandeur surrounding him. Suddenly struck by the Italian baroque statues and the grand piano of the former inhabitants, he demands to know how much it all cost and begins to berate his wife for her inappropriate extravagance. </p> <p>\"But it's all expropriated,\" she explains. Her husband, his brain rotten with disease, no longer understands this much-loved concept. \"Stolen. It's all stolen,\" she translates, sending him into one of the mad rages that - according to recently declassified documents - were a characteristic of his illness. </p> <p>A hazy, out-of-focus effect was created for the film, achieved with specially designed plastic and glass filters. Sokurov says it was to give the film an oil-painting feel, inspired by the paintings of Velazquez and Rembrandt. The effect is more as though the surroundings are being observed through the cataract-scarred eyes of an old man. </p> <p>Despite the director's desire to inspire pity and not censure, it's hard to feel too sorry for the dying Lenin. His powerful thirst for violence imbues the entire film. When he wakes up in the morning he asks his wife to read to him about different forms of punishment, about how the flesh falls from the human form after a certain amount of beating; when they sit together picnicking in a field, she reads to him in a comforting voice about death and torture. </p> <p>The merciless portrayal of illness makes this a painful film to watch: Lenin never stops groaning and muttering to himself, dragging his useless body around, collapsing as he tries to stand up, crawling on the ground. Only his beautifully observed death offers the audience a moment of respite: the final five minutes of the film are silent as Lenin sits in his wheelchair in the garden listening to the noise of cows and birds and thunder, waiting to die.</p>",

Washington has ruled out an apology, saying the crew of the EP-3E surveillance plane did nothing wrong. The secretary of state, Colin Powell, said yesterday that he regretted the loss of the missing Chinese pilot, who is feared dead, but said it was time to move on.</p> <p>\"The regret expressed by the US side is a step in the right direction to solving this question,\" said foreign ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi, in China's first response to Mr Powell's remarks.</p> <p>\"As for the next step in handling this issue, the key is for the US side to take a cooperative attitude, admit its mistakes, take responsibility for that and apologise,\" Mr Sun said. He gave no sign that the plane's crew members would be released soon, despite warnings from the US president, George Bush, that China risks undermining relations by continuing to hold them.</p> <p>Mr Sun said the crew members were being held while the collision was being investigated, adding: \"They have caused this air collision incident and they also entered illegally into China's airspace.

      "bodyText": "China today welcomed American expressions of regret for a Chinese pilot missing after a US spy plane collided with a Chinese fighter jet on Sunday, but repeated its demand for a full apology for the incident. Hardening its attitude, China said the US plane's 24 crew members had broken the law and were being questioned. Beijing's demand boded ill for a quick resolution to the crisis. Washington has ruled out an apology, saying the crew of the EP-3E surveillance plane did nothing wrong. The secretary of state, Colin Powell, said yesterday that he regretted the loss of the missing Chinese pilot, who is feared dead, but said it was time to move on. \"The regret expressed by the US side is a step in the right direction to solving this question,\" said foreign ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi, in China's first response to Mr Powell's remarks. \"As for the next step in handling this issue, the key is for the US side to take a cooperative attitude, admit its mistakes, take responsibility for that and apologise,\" Mr Sun said. He gave no sign that the plane's crew members would be released soon, despite warnings from the US president, George Bush, that China risks undermining relations by continuing to hold them. Mr Sun said the crew members were being held while the collision was being investigated, adding: \"They have caused this air collision incident and they also entered illegally into China's airspace. It is fully natural for competent authorities in China to question them about this incident.\" US diplomats have been granted just one meeting with the crew and are pressing for another. Mr Sun said the crew were safe and well and that China would consider another visit \"if the US side takes a cooperative approach.\" The crew have been held on Hainan island in the South China sea since making an emergency landing at a Chinese military base there after the collision on Sunday. Six US officials were waiting on Hainan in hopes of meeting them. In Beijing, police detained several Chinese protesters outside the walled US embassy compound today - an indication that the government does not want public anger over the incident to spill into the streets.

The jeans giant took Tesco to court in an attempt to stop it importing cheaper Levi's from outside the European Union to sell at cut prices. Levi's claimed the practice was against EU law. The decision marks a half-way stage in a four-year fight between Britain's biggest supermarket chain and the US jeans manufacturer. Today's ruling from a judge at the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg leaves the matter unresolved and the case will return to the British courts in the summer. But it represents a victory for Tesco, which can carry on selling the jeans until a final decision is reached. Levi's claims Tesco is debasing its brand by selling the jeans as a commodity.

      "body": "<p>It is a struggle to get information about Moldova. Planning a trip to the capital Chisinau this week, I had to explain several times over to friends just where exactly it lies.</p> <p>The telephone operator went so far as to suggest that it didn't even exist: \"Would that come under the Maldive islands, then?\" \"No, it's snugly placed between Romania to the west and Ukraine to the east.\" \"Are you sure it's really a country, as I have nothing on it here.\" Attempts to find weather reports on the internet were fruitless. \"See Romania\", I was told.</p> <p>Precisely because most fail to recognise Moldova, many Moldovans are now applying for Russian citizenship, in the hope of securing jobs elsewhere in Europe. Possess a Moldovan passport and you are likely to end up at the bottom of the bureaucrat's pile.</p> <p>Moldovan officials were deeply upset by an Economist article last year that called Europe's poorest country a \"nowhere land\". They might find, however, that this week Moldova has finally been put on the map - though not in the way they desired.</p> <p>Earlier this week it was revealed that two men were arrested after police caught them selling meat without a licence at a makeshift stall outside a butcher's shop in Chisinau.</p> <p>A customer who had bought some of the meat, on sale at $2 (\u00a31.40) a kilo, had become suspicious as it tasted like nothing he had ever eaten before.</p> <p>Tests soon proved that it was actually human flesh. An investigation has now been launched into a cancer clinic in the city, after the meat-sellers revealed to police that they had acquired the body parts, which included breasts, legs and arms, from the state-run institution. Poorly paid hospital workers are alleged to have sold the parts on.</p> <p>While the men face fines for selling meat without a licence, the clinic is in line for being penalised for not disposing of the parts in the correct manner - astonishingly feeble punishments.</p> <p>Those who devised the legal system could not have imagined needing to establish guidelines against cannibalism.</p> <p>The human flesh scandal is just the latest indication of how desperate this country of 4.5m has become. Monthly wages are between $20 and $30 (\u00a314-20), and many state workers have not been paid for months.</p> <p>Fire brigades have been forced to close down due to lack of money, leaving the government to issue orders for schools to install fire extinguishers instead. The country has been bled of 600,000, mainly young, people since independence from the Soviet Union a decade ago.</p> <p>The haemorrhaging is still going on. It is hard not to find somebody who has been abroad in search of work, or who has a family member who has done so: fathers go to work in olive farms in Greece, mothers go and work as nannies in central and western Europe, and young girls who answer adverts for cleaning jobs abroad often end up in prostitution or even sex-slavery rings, in Romania, Kosovo and other Balkan countries.</p> <p>The latest ways of trying to escape from poverty include selling kidneys and other body parts, or offering oneself as a human incubator. Childless Italian couples in particular are commissioning Moldovan women to bear offspring for them.</p> <p>The Guardian's Italian correspondent reported last year how Lelia, who earned just $10 (\u00a37) a month as a nurse, snapped up the offer to get $6,000 (\u00a34,000) from one couple. It was a far better option than prostitution, she thought, as she saw how the country's economy had collapsed, life expectancy had drastically reduced and hospitals had run out of anaesthetic. In short, giving birth earned her more than she would have got in two lifetimes of nursing.</p> <p>During 10 years of independence, while living standards in other EU would-be lands such as the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary have soared, in Moldova they have sunk drastically. The Russian financial crisis of 1998 caused the traditional markets for the agricultural country to collapse, and a series of droughts hit farmers badly. A severe cold snatch at the end of last year not only left hundreds of thousands of homes without heat and electricity for months, it also ruined crops.</p> <p>The situation became so bad that Moldova's last prime minister, Dumitru Braghis, commented that he felt more like a fire chief than a prime minister. ''It's as if there are fires everywhere - put one out and another starts up,'' he said.</p> <p>The culmination of disastrous events coupled with widespread corruption was Mr Braghis' downfall in February, when the communists returned to power, for the first time in an ex-Soviet state.</p> <p>The 70% of seats now occupied by the communist party have paved the way for its leader, Vladimir Voronin, to become president.

      "bodyText": "It is a struggle to get information about Moldova. Planning a trip to the capital Chisinau this week, I had to explain several times over to friends just where exactly it lies. The telephone operator went so far as to suggest that it didn't even exist: \"Would that come under the Maldive islands, then?\" \"No, it's snugly placed between Romania to the west and Ukraine to the east.\" \"Are you sure it's really a country, as I have nothing on it here.\" Attempts to find weather reports on the internet were fruitless. \"See Romania\", I was told. Precisely because most fail to recognise Moldova, many Moldovans are now applying for Russian citizenship, in the hope of securing jobs elsewhere in Europe. Possess a Moldovan passport and you are likely to end up at the bottom of the bureaucrat's pile. Moldovan officials were deeply upset by an Economist article last year that called Europe's poorest country a \"nowhere land\". They might find, however, that this week Moldova has finally been put on the map - though not in the way they desired. Earlier this week it was revealed that two men were arrested after police caught them selling meat without a licence at a makeshift stall outside a butcher's shop in Chisinau. A customer who had bought some of the meat, on sale at $2 (\u00a31.40) a kilo, had become suspicious as it tasted like nothing he had ever eaten before. Tests soon proved that it was actually human flesh. An investigation has now been launched into a cancer clinic in the city, after the meat-sellers revealed to police that they had acquired the body parts, which included breasts, legs and arms, from the state-run institution. Poorly paid hospital workers are alleged to have sold the parts on. While the men face fines for selling meat without a licence, the clinic is in line for being penalised for not disposing of the parts in the correct manner - astonishingly feeble punishments. Those who devised the legal system could not have imagined needing to establish guidelines against cannibalism. The human flesh scandal is just the latest indication of how desperate this country of 4.5m has become. Monthly wages are between $20 and $30 (\u00a314-20), and many state workers have not been paid for months. Fire brigades have been forced to close down due to lack of money, leaving the government to issue orders for schools to install fire extinguishers instead. The country has been bled of 600,000, mainly young, people since independence from the Soviet Union a decade ago. The haemorrhaging is still going on. It is hard not to find somebody who has been abroad in search of work, or who has a family member who has done so: fathers go to work in olive farms in Greece, mothers go and work as nannies in central and western Europe, and young girls who answer adverts for cleaning jobs abroad often end up in prostitution or even sex-slavery rings, in Romania, Kosovo and other Balkan countries. The latest ways of trying to escape from poverty include selling kidneys and other body parts, or offering oneself as a human incubator. Childless Italian couples in particular are commissioning Moldovan women to bear offspring for them. The Guardian's Italian correspondent reported last year how Lelia, who earned just $10 (\u00a37) a month as a nurse, snapped up the offer to get $6,000 (\u00a34,000) from one couple. It was a far better option than prostitution, she thought, as she saw how the country's economy had collapsed, life expectancy had drastically reduced and hospitals had run out of anaesthetic. In short, giving birth earned her more than she would have got in two lifetimes of nursing. During 10 years of independence, while living standards in other EU would-be lands such as the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary have soared, in Moldova they have sunk drastically. The Russian financial crisis of 1998 caused the traditional markets for the agricultural country to collapse, and a series of droughts hit farmers badly. A severe cold snatch at the end of last year not only left hundreds of thousands of homes without heat and electricity for months, it also ruined crops. The situation became so bad that Moldova's last prime minister, Dumitru Braghis, commented that he felt more like a fire chief than a prime minister. ''It's as if there are fires everywhere - put one out and another starts up,'' he said. The culmination of disastrous events coupled with widespread corruption was Mr Braghis' downfall in February, when the communists returned to power, for the first time in an ex-Soviet state. The 70% of seats now occupied by the communist party have paved the way for its leader, Vladimir Voronin, to become president. Presidential elections are this weekend, and no one is in any doubt that Mr Voronin, a former baker, will succeed. The outgoing president, Petru Lucinschi, a former communist turned centrist, has described as farcical his five years at the top. How many presidents would resort to such negative comments on leaving office? ''The time when I was working was a complete farce,'' he said, explaining that political bickering made it impossible to achieve much. He added that he hoped the little progress that had been made would prevent a ''return to the past''. As his country under the communists turns towards Russia and further away from the EU, his optimism seems a little out of place. The Moldovan response to all this is to roll out an old joke: \"what happens when things hit rock bottom?\" Answer: \"Start digging\". The question is, where to?

Because rovers, whether using wheels or legs, can only cover limited terrain around their landing sites, eventually Nasa plans missions employing aerobots (balloon-borne instrument packages circumnavigating the planet with the ambient wind), or some form of aeroplane.

In 2003 the European Space Agency will launch its Mars Express mission, with the British Beagle 2 lander on board.

Storms over Cape Canaveral this weekend would not be disastrous, just a hiccup. With the cruise to Mars taking about 200 days, arrival is in late October. A retarding thruster burn during approach will slow Odyssey into a 25-hour orbit. Then aerobraking - flying the satellite through the Martian upper atmosphere to dump momentum - will drop it into a low orbit, taking two hours to loop the planet. </p> <p>That should be completed by January.

      "bodyText": "\u0095 Christopher Walken is to tailor his malevolent movie presence in a comic direction when he takes the role of the human lead in Disney's animatronic kids adventure The Country Bears. Directed by Peter Hastings, the film follows the fortunes of a runaway cub (voiced by Haley Joel Osment) who hooks up with a jamboree-playing band of bears. Walken will play a Scrooge-like banker who wants to break up the party. \"Christopher as a heavy is a natural,\" Hastings told Mr. Showbiz. \"But what he really brings to the project is a great sense of humour.\" &amp;149; Gerard Depardieu and Guillaume Depardieu are to duplicate their father-son relationship in Honour Thy Father, a French family drama to be helmed by experienced TV director Jacob Berger. The pair previously acted together in All the Mornings of the World. \u0095 Bruce Greenwood (currently starring as JFK in 13 Days) and Linda Fiorentino, of Last Seduction fame, have both signed on to star in the indie production Spoils, which begins shooting on July 10 in locations around Europe and Canada. Written and directed by Nick Meyer, the film, which is set in the aftermath of the second world war, documents the true story of the theft of the German crown jewels. \u0095 Robert Carlyle has signed on for a leading role in the comedy Das Cowboy, a behind-the-scenes satire about a rogues gallery of actors attempting to make a movie western.",

Did God switch sides, he wondered?</p> <p>It was too much for Eugene Terre'Blanche and his neo-Nazi Afrikaner Resistance Movement (AWB). Almost no one in South Africa had heard of Terre'Blanche until he led the charge to punish Van Jaarsveld's heresy. After that, the AWB's ranks swelled, while the historian was shunned. White South Africa was far from ready to question the myths about God, race and land that provided the deluded basis for apartheid.</p> <p>Two decades later, the Day of the Covenant holiday has been consigned to a very tall scrap heap of discarded fictions once taken as history. But South Africa is grappling to decide what to replace them with. \"The standard thing here is to unlearn what you've learnt in school,\" says Bill Nasson, head of history at the University of Cape Town. \"You have this old history, which is that South Africa starts in 1652 with the arrival of Jan van Riebeeck. That's gone. The problem is what you replace that with. You could replace it with the liberation struggle that begins in 1653, but that simply replaces one form of nationalist history with another.</p> <p>\"South Africa has a very complex history. It's the only country in Africa that had slaves imported from other parts of Africa, and when some of those slaves were freed they took slaves themselves. The problem is to address this kind of thing without vilifying one group and making martyrs of another. Nothing is straightforward in our history.\"</p> <p>The first stage of officially reassessing South Africa's history has focused on schools, which are still waiting for the government to decide what will be taught, let alone rewrite the text books and print them. The education ministry appointed a committee of prominent historians, anthropologists and archaeologists - including Nasson - to mull over how best to address South Africa's complex past. There was common agreement that history is discredited and therefore in crisis.</p> <p>\"It is a considerable irony that we are having to address a 'crisis in history' when the pressing importance of history continues to be demonstrated daily in South Africa,\" the report said. \"For we live in a society in which contemporary issues are continually understood and judged within the powerful context of a past which has bequeathed a violent legacy of conquest, colonialism and apartheid.\"</p> <p>The school system is still heavily reliant on the old history books. Revised textbooks are available for those schools that can afford them. Some, such as the pioneering National Education Crisis Committee Peoples' History book, are widely praised. Others are simply the old version of events with a picture of Nelson Mandela on the cover.</p> <p>The easy bit was deciding to dump the version of history peppered with white heroes with Dutch surnames. For decades children of all races learned that the Afrikaner was the real victim of South Africa's strife. As it was told, the peaceful Boers who settled in the Cape were oppressed by the British in the early 19th century, and so forced to make the Great Trek north. They were attacked and betrayed by the great African chiefs, including the king of the Zulus, and so had to fight for their survival.</p> <p>And when they had finally established their own countries with the Boer republics, the British made war to get their hands on Johannesburg's gold mines. Tens of thousands of Boer women and children were murdered in the infamous British concentration camps. And when it was over, the Afrikaner was a British subject and a second-class citizen.</p> <p>Only in 1948, with the election of the National party government, was the Afrikaner liberated. All of this went to justify the imposition of apartheid. It was not a form of oppression, its authors argued, but a survival strategy for a people persecuted on all sides.</p> <p>In this version of history there was no room for the fate of the Khoikhoi, slaughtered after Van Riebeeck's arrival, or the tens of thousands of black people who also died in the British concentration camps. There was no mention of stolen land or forced removals or the execution of African men for wanting the right to govern. Neither was there recognition of the iron-age settlements in what is now Johannesburg, because that conflicted with the version of history that says the Afrikaners did not steal the land because it was empty.</p> <p>Much of Afrikaner historical orthodoxy emanated from Stellenbosch University. Today the history department is led by Albert Grundlingh, the first person to hold the post who is not a former student at Stellenbosch. \"History in this country is a congealed set of misunderstandings,\" he says. \"The problem today is that after 1994 [and South Africa's first all-race election], history sort of vanished. I would like to suggest that history has served its purpose so far as the liberation movement was concerned. They don't need it to justify being in power.</p> <p>\"That was not the case of the Afrikaners, who used history even after they won power in 1948. It was used to justify everything they did.</p> <p>\"I don't think we want to substitute one set of heroes for another - black for white. But we have to begin somewhere, and I'd like to think that there is a hidden history of black and white cooperation. You can ask yourself how it is possible to maintain a system like apartheid over 300 years without cooperation. That is a good basis for exploration.\"</p> <p>Thabo Bashe knows only too well the shortcomings of the old version of history. Once a political prisoner, he is now deputy headmaster of Zola secondary school in Khayelitsha, a sprawling black township outside Cape Town. \"We wanted to know more about the struggle against apartheid. At school nothing would be said about that. As students we wanted to learn about Mandela and how the land was taken from black farmers. I went to a meeting addressed by Steve Biko, and that was the first time we heard about our own history.\"</p> <p>Yet 11 years after Mandela was released from prison, and seven years after he was elected president, Zola secondary school still relies on apartheid-era history books. Some pupils use a 1987 text, History In Action, written specifically for black schools. It has 30 pages on the Great Trek. There are just three on black South African history.</p> <p>Bashe despairs. \"If you go to class, most teachers are still using the same books and asking the same questions of learners and marking them in the same way,\" he says. \"The sad thing is, the learners don't seem to notice. It takes a long time to get the idea of white superiority out of the system, even among black learners.\"</p> <p>Bashe says that in many ways it would be easier to leave history out of the curriculum. \"But we have to teach history because these learners must be able to understand why we have Khayelitsha and why there are only black people here and why there are no coloured [mixed-race] or white people. They will understand this is a wrong thing, and that is why this must never happen again. So if the government says we are going to oppress the white people who did this to us, they need to understand why that is wrong.\"</p> <p>Many whites have reinterpreted history to suit themselves, though on the whole they prefer to avoid the subject. \"In Afrikaner circles there has been a flight from history because of apartheid,\" says Dr Grundlingh. \"But there are others who are discovering another false history. Among some coloured people there's the deliberate invention of a Khoikhoi heritage as a way of saying we were here before the black people. It's one-upping the Africans. It's a joke because I don't think any of them have Khoikhoi blood. This is how myths are made.\"</p>",

A Tory motion to stop the government's guillotine motion was defeated by 320 votes to 185. The guillotine measure had only been introduced because the Opposition frontbench was incapable of preventing its own backbenchers, Mr Straw said.</p> <p>The Conservative leader William Hague said he would not co-operate with the bill, arguing the local elections should be held back until the foot and mouth crisis had been fully cleared. Conservatives added it was wrong to delay local elections in Northern Ireland since there was only one outbreak of foot and mouth throughout the province. It is the first time local elections have been delayed since the second world war.</p> <p>The bill also allows 50% compensation to cover the extra cost for councils of delaying the elections.

      "bodyText": "Emergency legislation postponing local elections until June 7 because of the foot-and-mouth outbreak came under assault from Tory MPs last night despite government efforts to push the bill through the Commons in a day. Tories claimed the severe restrictions on debate were \"outrageous and absurd\", tyrannical and an \"insult to the parliamentary process\". But the home secretary, Jack Straw, said it was essential to move quickly to provide certainty for everyone involved in the elections. A Tory motion to stop the government's guillotine motion was defeated by 320 votes to 185. The guillotine measure had only been introduced because the Opposition frontbench was incapable of preventing its own backbenchers, Mr Straw said. The Conservative leader William Hague said he would not co-operate with the bill, arguing the local elections should be held back until the foot and mouth crisis had been fully cleared. Conservatives added it was wrong to delay local elections in Northern Ireland since there was only one outbreak of foot and mouth throughout the province. It is the first time local elections have been delayed since the second world war. The bill also allows 50% compensation to cover the extra cost for councils of delaying the elections. It is due to be discussed by the Lords today and on Monday and could become law early next week. MPs were also being asked to speed through the elections (publications) bill which is designed to save political parties having to pulp tens of thousands of election leaflets. It was introduced after the parties realised they were all go ing to be in breach of revised regulations on the printing of election material such as posters.

The Conservative bakcbencher, Eric Forth, claimed the government was \"breaking new parliamentary ground by having the gall and the arrogance to say the law of the land should be made with one hour's consideration\". The shadow home secretary, Ann Widdecombe, accused the government of laziness for setting an 11pm deadline for consideration of the bills last night. She said: \"Members opposite want to go home rather than to stay here and ensure that the legislation being considered ... is in good order.\" For the Liberal Democrats, Andrew Stunnell said the guillotine motion was \"completely out of place\" and unnecessary. \"The government should first of all agree to lift the guillotine and withdraw the motion and let the debate take its course: they would be pleasantly surprised,\" he said.

      "body": "<p>Vivienne Westwood has dressed everyone from the Sex Pistols to supermodels. It is 60 years on Sunday since she was born, near the village of Tintwistle in Derbyshire; 30 years since she opened her legendary Kings Road shop. Once the Queen of Punk, Westwood has become the tabloids' favourite English eccentric, a dotty aunt figure patronised by taxi drivers and kissed in the street by strangers. </p> <p>Westwood still holds a respectable evening slot on the Paris fashion week calendar; she is still sole owner of her company and of her name, no mean feat in a cut-throat industry full of white-toothed alligators hungry to strip the flesh off starry-eyed designers' ideas. Her stature is deserved: she is a great innovator, a unique talent who combines an insatiable appetite for culture and historical references with an unclouded modern eye and a rigorous approach to the craft of making clothes. As the art director of punk and the creator of the Pirates and Mini Crini collections, Westwood is responsible for some of fashion's most memorable images. Currently, moreover, she is enjoying a revival of interest among the edgier, artier ranks of the fashion world, with stylists and the hipper It Girls fighting over vintage Westwood pieces. </p> <p>She is, however, in an absolutely foul mood. She doesn't want revivals, she doesn't want to be a national treasure. She wants to be taken seriously as a contemporary fashion designer. Her ex-husband, Malcolm McLaren, knew how to inflict maximum pain when he said last year that her designs \"seemed to make more sense back in the 80s\". Today she is fuming over the meagre press coverage of her most recent collection. In her surprisingly dowdy Battersea office, dressed in a tartan skirt with pink tights and sweater. With a diamante spider glittering at her throat, she fiddles with her cuffs and chainsmokes Gitanes, her pursed mouth emphasising the flatness of her Derbyshire vowels. Her hair is scooped into the picture-perfect pin curls of a Disney cartoon princess and tinted the colour of peach yoghurt. She is attempting to put a brave face on the disappointment - \"I don't really care about the press. I used to be upset by it, but now it doesn't upset me\" - but the bravado is not entirely convincing. \"It's just annoying when you do what in my opinion is the best show of the whole season and there are no pictures of it, and in a few years someone else will copy it and everyone will think it's new.\" </p> <p>Would it be fair to say she feels bitter? \"Not at all. I'm very happy at the moment.\" She bristles visibly. \"The world is a paradise,\" she snaps. </p> <p>Westwood has never been the cosy figure some would now like to cast her as. Born Vivienne Swire, she married Derek Westwood at 21, and had a son, Ben. But three years later, she left her home and her career as a primary school teacher, and discovered Malcolm McLaren and fashion. Her 15-year relationship with McLaren was a great creative partnership, and produced a son, Joe. Now grown up, Joe Corre (the name came from McLaren's grandmother after McLaren refused to put his name on his son's birth certificate) is co-owner and co-designer of the Agent Provocateur lingerie label with his wife, Serena Rees. Their three-year-old daughter, Cora, took a star turn on Westwood's catwalk last month. Since 1992, Westwood has been married to her third husband, Andreas Kronthaler. </p> <p>But these days, says Westwood, it is becoming difficult to shock anyone. \"When I first started out I was walking around in S&amp;M clothes, and no one else was. But these days those things are so mainstream that I'm not sure where you get that edge of rebellion from.\" </p> <p>She attracts publicity without trying: in 1992 she twirled for the photographers outside Buckingham Palace after collecting her OBE, forgetting she wasn't wearing knickers; in 1999 she found herself in the headlines when it was discovered that Lambeth Council and the Heritage Lottery Fund had given \u00a317,530 to restore iron railings and cracks in the brickwork of her Clapham house, once the home of Captain Cook's mother. Her views on fashion and sex are always provocative: she pronounces today, for instance, that \"it is wonderful to be an object. You learn your power that way. I don't think feminists realise that.\" </p> <p>But she doesn't want to talk about fashion. She wants to talk about reading, \"the most concentrated form of experience you can have\". A committed auto-didact, Westwood has long been a voracious reader: even as a punk, she remembers, \"I'd be designing and in the back of my mind would be, I'll just get this done and then I can read my book.\" </p> <p>Her favourite authors are Aldous Huxley and Bertrand Russell; she has most recently bought the book IBM and The Holocaust: \"Because I think that's very important to read. The lengths that businesses will go to to make money - that sums up the 20th century, doesn't it. They would not have been able to round up all those Jewish people if IBM hadn't supplied all the information.\" </p> <p>For years, Westwood has favoured Paris for staging catwalk shows. \"I've hardly ever shown in London. There was a short time, when there was Rifat [Ozbek] and John Galliano showing here, that it felt like there was quite a high standard. But not now. Whereas there are people working in Paris who I consider to have some sort of professionalism,\" she pronounces haughtily, lighting yet another Gitane. </p> <p>She likes Paris, although an unnamed friend thinks it has \"gone downhill\". Why? \"Because of Marxism. People who consider themselves intellectuals but don't have time to really explore ideas ... Everything comes from Marx, this idea that everyone is supposed to be equal. I'm not harking upon [sic] to any age of privilege, I'm only remarking that in those ages of privilege, you also had a hierarchy of values, and nowadays there's no intrinsic value. This idea that the proletariat is born better than the rest of the world, that anyone can do anything, just because they want to, that it's all subjective.\" </p> <p>Is that not a somewhat different viewpoint from Marxism? \"Everything comes from Marx. Marxism has got completely melded with democracy.\" </p> <p>It's hard to figure out what she's trying to say and how we got here from discussing Paris. Perhaps she is referring to the recent French municipal elections, and Paris' new socialist mayor? \"What elections. I didn't know about any elections,\" she huffs. She is really cross now, whether because France had the temerity to hold elections without informing her personally, or because she suspects me of making up world events, I don't know. Does she read the newspapers? \"Of course I read the newspapers\". And so we go on. </p> <p>She is not easy to talk to today. A few days later she sends me a fax to clarify her opinions on \"the Marxism issue\". Her point is that \"when there are no judges there is no art, because we're left with the idea that everything is equal and nothing has intrinsic value.\" </p> <p>She is in the habit of sending such notes after interviews: detesting interruptions, she is keen to make sure you fully ingest her views. She is naturally a declaimer rather than a debater, shooting out peculiar, brittle shards of dinner-party cleverness, loudly but without eye contact: \"I don't believe there's such a thing as progress\" and even \"There haven't been any ideas in the 20th century.\" </p> <p>She seems unwilling to entertain the concept that there might be interesting ideas of which she is unaware. She rarely visits the theatre, for instance, simply because \"there's not much going on there\". </p> <p>On the subject of her fellow designers she attempts regal disdain - \"It's not of any great interest to me what anyone else is doing\" - but cannot resist adding cattily \"although it would be, if I thought they were doing anything good.\" </p> <p>The trouble with fashion is that: \"There's no professionalism any more. It's all about art school, and designers aren't taught anything technical. They're not taught how to manipulate fabrics. I can make manufactured garments hang like couture, because I understand fabric. If you don't have technique you can't express yourself; you can do whatever drawing you like but it's not going to work, so you can only put together things you've already seen. Art school ruins people. After three or five years there these people think they can make clothes, and they can't. They're very frustrated.\" </p> <p>A weary sigh. \"Actually, they're not frustrated. Some of them think they're wonderful\" she spits, sounding rather frustrated herself.</p>",

They would then hand him over to the Hague not grudgingly or reluctantly but with the full knowledge that it was right for him and them.</p> <p>\"I welcome the arrest of Mr Milosevic and the statement by President Kostunica that no one is above the law. But it is vital that Mr Milosevic is not above international law either,\" Mr Cook said after meeting Mr Kostunica and having lunch with Goran Svilanovic, the Yugoslav foreign minister.</p> <p>\"I fully understand the importance of having Mr Milosevic take responsibility for his crimes against the Serb people. It's an educational process. But when the due legal process is over and when he has stood trial before the Serb people, then there must be an international trial.\"</p> <p>In a separate meeting with the Serbian justice minister, Vladan Batic, the foreign secretary suggested that the Hague's formal indictment of the former president for war crimes be handed by the Serb authorities to Mr Milosevic immediately. This would be a \"good downpayment\", one British diplomat said.</p> <p>In a reminder of the foot and mouth crisis at home, Mr Cook was met at the airport not by a red carpet but a mat soaked in disinfectant, and a basin in which to wash his hands.</p> <p>It was the foreign secretary's first visit to Yugoslavia since the Nato bombardment in 1999, during which he was attacked in the Serb media as an enemy and one of the main architects of Nato's intervention. Asked if he felt remorse, the foreign secretary said Mr Milosevic had caused the bombing by refusing to accept peace proposals and continuing with ethnic cleansing.</p> <p>Mr Svilanovic replied delicately, \"I will never forget those months, nor will any Serb\".</p> <p>\"As a government, we don't forget the events which preceded the bombing.\"</p> <p>Britain is Yugoslavia's biggest single creditor with some \u00a3610m of private and public debt outstanding. Yugoslavia's total debt is \u00a38.4bn and servicing it costs eight times the current export earnings.</p> <p>Mr Cook pledged to help Yugoslavia reform its economy and restructure its debt. Britain was also giving bilateral aid \"in making good for the damage and loss of the Milosevic years\", he said, treading a fine line between reparations, which no western government will accept, and the need to be generous now that a democratic regime is in power.</p> <p>British officials fear that unless the Serbian economy improves soon, there could be a backlash against the new government as well as against the west.</p> <p>Washington wants to link any future aid to collaboration with the Hague tribunal, but Mr Cook flatly rejected yesterday any idea of conditionality. The Hague issue was part of a \"parallel process\", he said.</p> <p>\"The people of Yugoslavia must meet their obligations to the international community. There is a limit as to how far we can go if that partnership is not reciprocated.\"</p> <p>Mr Cook gave no hint as to where the limit is, although it is expected to be sometime before the end of this year.</p> <p>\u0095Guerrillas from Albania are recruiting ethnic Albanians in western Macedonia to open up a second front, reports said.</p> <p>Police said \"uniformed people\" had been seen near Debar, a town of 15,000 people split between ethnic Albanians and Macedonian Muslims.

But it is vital that Mr Milosevic is not above international law either,\" Mr Cook said after meeting Mr Kostunica and having lunch with Goran Svilanovic, the Yugoslav foreign minister. \"I fully understand the importance of having Mr Milosevic take responsibility for his crimes against the Serb people. It's an educational process. But when the due legal process is over and when he has stood trial before the Serb people, then there must be an international trial.\" In a separate meeting with the Serbian justice minister, Vladan Batic, the foreign secretary suggested that the Hague's formal indictment of the former president for war crimes be handed by the Serb authorities to Mr Milosevic immediately. This would be a \"good downpayment\", one British diplomat said. In a reminder of the foot and mouth crisis at home, Mr Cook was met at the airport not by a red carpet but a mat soaked in disinfectant, and a basin in which to wash his hands. It was the foreign secretary's first visit to Yugoslavia since the Nato bombardment in 1999, during which he was attacked in the Serb media as an enemy and one of the main architects of Nato's intervention. Asked if he felt remorse, the foreign secretary said Mr Milosevic had caused the bombing by refusing to accept peace proposals and continuing with ethnic cleansing. Mr Svilanovic replied delicately, \"I will never forget those months, nor will any Serb\". \"As a government, we don't forget the events which preceded the bombing.\" Britain is Yugoslavia's biggest single creditor with some \u00a3610m of private and public debt outstanding. Yugoslavia's total debt is \u00a38.4bn and servicing it costs eight times the current export earnings. Mr Cook pledged to help Yugoslavia reform its economy and restructure its debt. Britain was also giving bilateral aid \"in making good for the damage and loss of the Milosevic years\", he said, treading a fine line between reparations, which no western government will accept, and the need to be generous now that a democratic regime is in power. British officials fear that unless the Serbian economy improves soon, there could be a backlash against the new government as well as against the west. Washington wants to link any future aid to collaboration with the Hague tribunal, but Mr Cook flatly rejected yesterday any idea of conditionality. The Hague issue was part of a \"parallel process\", he said. \"The people of Yugoslavia must meet their obligations to the international community. There is a limit as to how far we can go if that partnership is not reciprocated.\" Mr Cook gave no hint as to where the limit is, although it is expected to be sometime before the end of this year. \u0095Guerrillas from Albania are recruiting ethnic Albanians in western Macedonia to open up a second front, reports said. Police said \"uniformed people\" had been seen near Debar, a town of 15,000 people split between ethnic Albanians and Macedonian Muslims. Camps used by the Kosovo Liberation Army have been reopened inside Albania, too. AFP \u0095 Hear Jonathan Steele reporting from Belgrade at theguardian.com/serbia",

Kansan anger turned instantly to satisfied smiles. But it was a costly admission. Back in Washington, the Post's lawyers were none too pleased. They read my friend the riot act and told him that he must never - but never - say sorry again.</p> <p>As the armed forces of the only nation which claims the right to patrol every corner of the globe in the interests of its own security, it is inevitable that the American military will find itself in more unexpected collisions and accidents than any other.

Whether they are slicing through a ski lift cable in the Italian Alps, or getting into a tangle with the Chinese air force, the thought of quickly uttering the soft words that might drive away wrath never comes naturally to the Pentagon.</p> <p>Instead, the US military - which in some other contexts can be remarkably open, honest and informative, especially by British standards - tends to go into instant denial.

America is a society which is consumed with the need to achieve emotional \"closure\" over its own domestic crises. The inability to see such incidents as others see them, and thus to allow others to achieve similar closure, has become a national attitude of mind.</p> <p>George Bush seems very unlikely to change this approach. He came to power with an election pledge which he calls \"tort reform\" which is specifically designed to absolve large corporations from liability in class action legal suits.

Instead of releasing the US crew and the plane, Beijing persists in demanding a public apology and an end to US surveillance flights. China says it has proof that the US was to blame for the incident and warns it may \"punish\" the pilot. But it seems fairly clear that the mid-air collision was an accident. And the Chinese must surely know that these demands and threats are in any case unacceptable to the Bush administration. So from Beijing's point of view, what purpose is served by prolonging and perhaps exacerbating this stand-off?</p> <p>China's military can no doubt see several possible advantages in such a course. The longer the situation remains unresolved, the longer it has to strip the EP-3 spy plane of its electronic secrets. The presumed loss of the Chinese fighter pilot has cynical domestic propaganda value, as did Nato's bombing of China's Belgrade embassy in 1999. This involuntary \"sacrifice\" buttresses the nationalist credo that has replaced communism as Chinese society's binding glue. The affair is already being used to reinforce China's disputed claims to large areas of the South China sea. It potentially sows discord among discomfited US regional allies such as Japan and South Korea. And it increases the influence of hardline PLA generals, who view the US as an enemy with whom conflict is inevitable and who believe China's political leadership has been too conciliatory up to now.</p> <p>Yet President Jiang Zemin also seems to view the EP-3's descent on Hainan as a gift from the gods. Perhaps he and the politburo reckon that while baulking at an apology, George Bush may be induced to make concessions in other areas to get his people home. China would dearly love to see a postponement of an imminent US decision on new arms sales to Taiwan, for example. Failing that, perhaps it hopes to benefit from reduced pressure over its human rights abuses or in its WTO membership negotiations. And come what may, Hainan has given China a heaven-sent opportunity to test Mr Bush's mettle, to prod and probe and discover just what he is made of.</p> <p>But this is exactly the point at which all such Chinese calculations could go badly awry. Having tried the diplomatic approach, Mr Bush is under growing pressure to act. There is already talk of downgrading ties and cancelling a presidential visit this autumn. The Republican-led Congress may, for example, expedite rather than delay the Taiwan arms transfers - the very opposite of what Beijing wants. But Mr Bush could go much further, and faster, if he wishes, in terms of trade measures and increased military activity in the region. He showed over Iraq and Kyoto that he is ready to make the tough (and wrong) call. He could surprise China and the world by doing so again, for in a situation such as this he remains an unknown quantity. That disturbing scenario apart, there is also the possibly lasting, negative impact of Beijing's tactics to be considered. If the US loses face, the hawks who argue for a tougher overall policy-line on China may definitively prevail.</p> <p>Thus do Mr Jiang's clever strategems over Hainan threaten to be his own undoing. China is now in clear danger of overplaying its hand. It would be best advised to return to restraint and patch matters up. Beijing's various feints and gambits may make for good diplomatic chess. But it should realise that where Mr Bush comes from, they prefer poker.

But none of this money will go to the train operating companies, which claim that they have not been fully re- imbursed by Railtrack for the money they have lost from cancelled services. One of them, Virgin, is planning price increases of up to 10% in May, during the election campaign. Other train operators will also raise their prices, but by not as much. Virgin's long-distance routes are particularly vulnerable since disgruntled customers can travel by plane or car, whereas suburban commuters have not got a choice.

First, it is vital that we modernise our railways as soon as possible and, second, because the taxpayers' money cannot be injected into the railways so they can pay dividends to shareholders. It is worth pointing out that the \u00a31.5bn promised to Railtrack this week - only part of what the railways will receive overall - could have purchased over 50% of the shares in Railtrack at yesterday's (depressed) price on the stock market. There is a strong case that all new public money vested in the railways should be in the form of new equity so the taxpayer has a stake in any returns. More worrying, however, is the danger that there may not be any returns.

What's more, it is able to respond to statements such as \"I'm going for dinner tomorrow with so-and-so,\" with retorts such as: \"Really, you took her to the same restaurant last time.\" And as the robot remembers words from past events, it is also able to continue the conversation with remarks such as, \"You were late for your last date with her, weren't you, so watch yourself,\" and so forth, Tomy said. Memoni, who weighs in at 600 grams and stands 18 cm tall, \"uses artificial intelligence to pick up relevant words within a conversation and can answer accordingly,\" says a Tomy spokesman. It homes in on two words in the conversation such as \"date\" and someone's name and makes an informed guess at what might be an appropriate retort. However, for the time being, Memoni can only converse in Japanese. Initial training of the drone takes one week and it can also be used as a kind of secretary, as it keeps a diary and can remembers users' schedules. Programmed to remember birthdays and meetings, Memoni is capable of greeting its user with a rendition of Happy Birthday on the appropriate morning and ask how yesterday's meeting went. About to go on sale this summer in Japan, Memoni joins a growing band of intelligent electronic companions, including its English-speaking stablemate Dog.com - the latest Aibo rival - to be launched in the UK this May by Tomy. Derided by scientists in the past as idle imagining, androids (or humanoids, to use the preferred robotics term) are now springing to life in labs across the world. From fiction to reality, the circle of the android/ humanoid tale, it seems, is nearing completion.",

In the latest of a series of IT-related humiliations to hit national air traffic control services, it is being sued by the US computing giant EDS for more than \u00a342m in damages after the termination of a 13-year contract to build, install and support a new transatlantic air traffic control computer system at Prestwick. The government announced last week that, subject to regulatory clearance, the operation of Nats will be taken over by a consortium of seven British airlines later this year. The group, which includes British Airways and Virgin Atlantic, has promised to invest \u00a31bn over 10 years. But those investment plans may be undermined by the EDS action, which is due to be heard in the high court next January. If the action is successful, the final legal bill for Nats could be substantially more than the \u00a342.8m that EDS claims it has lost as a direct result of the contract termination. EDS is also claiming for the loss of additional income it would have made if it had been able to exploit its copyright on the new system by selling it to other governments around the world. The official reason given for the cancellation in July last year - a full 18 months before the scheduled completion date - was that EDS had missed an important deadline, making it unlikely that the project would be completed on time. In its writ the company, which was founded by former US presidential candidate Ross Perot in the 1960s and which had revenues of more than $19bn last year, denied both that it missed the deadline and that the final completion date would have been affected.

In a report today Computing Weekly suggests that a more important factor in the decision to cancel was the government's insistence, against the advice of Nats officials, that the project be run under the private finance initiative. It has uncovered evidence that another Nats PFI project, to build a new Scottish air traffic control centre covering the area north of Carlisle to the Faroe Islands, was cancelled after fears were raised about the impact of PFI on the part privatisation of Nats. Officials were concerned that the private sector would be reluctant to invest in Nats if a substantial part of its operations was already being run by another private company under a long-term contract. A memo from the Department of the Environment to the Commons transport committee reveals that the government's financial advisers on the Nats selloff, Credit Suisse First Boston, \"expressed reservations about the desirability of the proposed PFI project in the context of a [public private partnership] for Nats.\" The contract was subsequently cancelled and Nats paid \u00a37m in compensation to the contractor, Sky Solutions.

      "bodyText": "When the Queen delivered her speech to the House of Lords last December spelling out the government's plans for the next parliamentary session, very few MPs expected more than a smattering of the 15 bills to complete the trek through both chambers and gain royal assent before a general election. The prime minister's decision to put back a general election to June 7 means that instead of dissolving parliament for a May 3 election, MPs and peers are now faced with more space than they bargained for in their legislative programme. However, with parliament breaking up next week for a two-week Easter recess, there will be little more than a fortnight's extra time to push through bills before May 14 - the latest date that parliament can be dissolved for a June 7 general election. First, the home secretary, Jack Straw, must get through emergency legislation to delay the local elections in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. With cross-party support, that could be done in two days - however, Conservatives are now calling for the local elections to be postponed indefinitely, and could thereby hold up legislation in the Lords if they wished. But because the leader of the house, Margaret Beckett, decides each Thursday the business for the following week, which bills the government will press ahead with remains to be seen. Thus the options facing the prime minister, and his advisers, on which bills to push, are almost as delicately poised as the decision to delay the election itself. This is the current state of play of the five pieces of legislation directly affecting the public sector: Adoption and children The biggest change in adoption laws for 25 years, the bill will enable more children in care to be adopted, speed up the adoption process and give more support to parents. It will create an independent review mechanism for would-be adopters who are turned down by social services, and a national adoption register to enable children to be matched more quickly with potential parents. What stage is it at? Introduced to the Commons on March 15 in the wake of the public furore over the \"internet twins\" case (although regulations to outlaw adoption over the internet are contained in the separate Intercountry adoption act), it received its second reading on March 26. What happens next? Never expected to complete its passage before the election, now likely to return next session, assuming Labour is returned to government. Useful sites Adoption and children bill Big issue: intercountry adoption Health and social care bill This bill allows the government to take forward its NHS plan, published in July 2000, which aims to \"modernise\" the health service and make the NHS more \"patient-centred\". Includes a range of measures relating to primary care, long-term care of the elderly, local government scrutiny of the NHS, patient advocacy, patient confidentiality, nurse prescribing, the creation of care trusts, employment issues and drugs dispensing. What stage is it at? Introduced to the Commons on December 20 2000, the bill reached the Lords on February 15. The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats threatened to derail the bill unless concessions were made on key areas such as the abolition of community health councils and the provision of powers to enable the health secretary to disclose confidential patient information to cancer researchers.

      "body": "<p>A major outbreak of tuberculosis - which may turn out to be one of the biggest in the UK since the disease was brought under control in the 1980s - has been identified at a secondary school in Leicester. </p> <p>Last night public health officials said 24 cases of TB have been confirmed, 20 of them children at Crown Hills community college and one a teacher. About 700 children, aged 11 to 14, have been screened and of those a further 60 look likely to have been infected with the disease. </p> <p>\"This is a major outbreak,\" said Gerry Bryant, specialist registrar in public health with Leicestershire health authority. \"I'm not aware of a published outbreak of this size in a school. We believe it might be part of a larger community outbreak. It is very difficult to tell at this stage.\" </p> <p>Dr Philip Monk, consultant on communicable disease control at the health authority, blamed the outbreak on a particularly virulent strain of the disease that is spreading rapidly. </p> <p>Thousands of children may potentially have to be screened if it is thought the disease had spread. \"We may be looking at six primary schools that feed into Crown Hills community college. That would be 2,000-2,500 pupils as a starting point. Then there are around 3,000 pupils from secondary schools,\" Dr Monk said. </p> <p>It is highly unusual to get a significant number of cases in a school because generally, children tend to be infected not by each other but by very close contact with adults, usually members of their family. </p> <p>There will certainly be more cases to come. Every child and teacher in the school will now be screened. Not every person who develops TB is infectious, but some of the Crown Hills children have proved to be so, and so the disease may well have spread within their families. All those infected have been given the standard course of antibiotic TB treatment, and the 60 who had strongly positive skin-prick tests, indicating likely infection, have been given a shorter course to keep the disease at bay. </p> <p>The outbreak began when one child in year nine developed TB last August. Ninety-three per cent of the children at the school are of Asian origin and it is possible the child became infected on a visit to India, where TB is endemic. The second case, in October, involving a child in the same class, was discovered when the first child's close contacts were screened. When a third child in the class developed TB last month, it was decided to mount a major screening exercise. </p> <p>For Gary Coleby, headteacher of the school in inner-city Leicester, the news of the rising numbers is a blow.

      "bodyText": "A major outbreak of tuberculosis - which may turn out to be one of the biggest in the UK since the disease was brought under control in the 1980s - has been identified at a secondary school in Leicester. Last night public health officials said 24 cases of TB have been confirmed, 20 of them children at Crown Hills community college and one a teacher. About 700 children, aged 11 to 14, have been screened and of those a further 60 look likely to have been infected with the disease. \"This is a major outbreak,\" said Gerry Bryant, specialist registrar in public health with Leicestershire health authority. \"I'm not aware of a published outbreak of this size in a school. We believe it might be part of a larger community outbreak. It is very difficult to tell at this stage.\" Dr Philip Monk, consultant on communicable disease control at the health authority, blamed the outbreak on a particularly virulent strain of the disease that is spreading rapidly. Thousands of children may potentially have to be screened if it is thought the disease had spread. \"We may be looking at six primary schools that feed into Crown Hills community college. That would be 2,000-2,500 pupils as a starting point. Then there are around 3,000 pupils from secondary schools,\" Dr Monk said. It is highly unusual to get a significant number of cases in a school because generally, children tend to be infected not by each other but by very close contact with adults, usually members of their family. There will certainly be more cases to come. Every child and teacher in the school will now be screened. Not every person who develops TB is infectious, but some of the Crown Hills children have proved to be so, and so the disease may well have spread within their families. All those infected have been given the standard course of antibiotic TB treatment, and the 60 who had strongly positive skin-prick tests, indicating likely infection, have been given a shorter course to keep the disease at bay. The outbreak began when one child in year nine developed TB last August. Ninety-three per cent of the children at the school are of Asian origin and it is possible the child became infected on a visit to India, where TB is endemic. The second case, in October, involving a child in the same class, was discovered when the first child's close contacts were screened. When a third child in the class developed TB last month, it was decided to mount a major screening exercise. For Gary Coleby, headteacher of the school in inner-city Leicester, the news of the rising numbers is a blow. Its Ofsted report before Christmas said it was one of the best urban schools in the country. And for three years running it has been one of the government's top 200 improving schools. Mr Coleby is trying hard to reassure everyone that it is business as usual. \"The original three children diagnosed have all been treated and are all back at school,\" he said. \"The parents are concerned but they are being kept very closely informed about what is going on and they are involved in the process so they know what is happening. We do have a lot of parental support here and it is now paying dividends. New strains \"The most important message is that there is no panic and the school is operating absolutely as normal, although with some disruption because of the screening.\" Sixty years ago, this outbreak would have been a disaster and a tragedy, because TB was a regular killer, but the BCG vaccination, together with better drug treatment, surveillance and meticulous follow-up of all the contacts of anyone with the infection have made deaths unnecessary. But nobody takes tuberculosis lightly. The number of cases in the country is rising among people who are born abroad or whose parents were. TB is killing millions in south-east Asia, Africa and eastern Europe - and is frequently the direct cause of death of those whose immune systems have been damaged by HIV.

It will serve only to enhance Gordon Brown's power, they are warning. Neither Jack Straw, home secretary, nor David Blunkett, who is widely expected to move from the Department of Education and Employment to succeed him, is keen to see his likely new territory dismembered - \"Balkanised\" as one cabinet minister put it - in advance. But John Prescott, who is ready to leave the huge Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions - which Mr Straw could take over - will be reluctant to move unless he can take regional policy and local government with him to a new post, probably in the Cabinet Office. Nothing has yet been decided. But Tony Blair would need a rough idea of changes he wants to make, in advance of Labour's expected second election victory on June 7, in order to fit relatively round ministerial pegs into round departmental holes. If time can be found from the foot and mouth crisis, the five extra pre-election weeks now at No 10's disposal may allow for more radical options to be finalised before the upper tier of cabinet, unchanged since 1997, is reshuffled. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, long the target of reformers for its poor track record, is likely to survive for the time being for precisely that reason: breaking it up or creating a department of rural affairs would divert and demoralise officials now struggling with foot and mouth. Ministers are aware they can be accused of empire building if they resist plans being drawn up in think tanks, the Cabinet Office and the Downing Street performance and innovation unit. So the main reason they advance for resisting \"Balkanisation\" is that it will serve only to increase the octopus-like power of the Treasury under the chancellor, Mr Brown. Mr Blair is famously uninterested in tinkering with the machinery of government. But key members of the Downing Street staff are disappointed with the results of four years spent trying to force Whitehall's \"feudal baronies\", as a key Blair adviser calls them, to co-operate more to push through policies that address problems such as poverty right across the board. A Cabinet Office official, Sonia Phippard, has been drawing up options to present to the cabinet secretary, Sir Richard Wilson. But Geoff Mulgan in the performance and innovation unit and David Miliband, head of the No 10 policy unit, both political appointees, are considering their own blueprints. They will have to square their plans with the personalities and portfolios Mr Blair must juggle. \"David Blunkett wants the home office, but he doesn't want a ministry of justice taken out,\" said one minister. \"Jack [Straw] won't get the foreign office - Tony doesn't want an anti-European there - but he won't want DETR broken up if he goes there.\" Talk of taking transport out of the DETR again is now widely condemned as unwise.

But Mr Blair is now lavish in his praise of the foreign secretary as a safe pair of hands at summits and elsewhere.

John Prescott, the deputy prime minister, later claimed that it would help to bring about an \"urban renaissance\" in these areas. Michael Portillo, the shadow chancellor, last night seized on the delay. \"Gordon Brown has spent the past four years in creasing taxes, like stamp duty,\" he said. \"Now we learn that he is not even able to deliver a tiny relief from his own stealth tax, when he promised he would do so,\" Mr Portillo added The Treasury last night played down the delay, saying that the chancellor had always said that the measure would be introduced only when the finance bill received royal assent. The delay is expected to hold up property sales in deprived areas as buyers wait to benefit from the tax cut. Stamp duty is paid on property deals worth more than \u00a360,000. Buyers have to pay 1% of the value of their property on sales over \u00a360,000 and under \u00a3250,000. This rises to 3% on properties over \u00a3250,000 and under \u00a3500,000. On properties worth more than \u00a3500,000 buyers pay 4%. Michael Osborne, the director of the East London estate agents Hamilton Fox, said: \"Buyers for \u00a3250,000 plus properties will definitely be waiting until they hear the news on stamp duty. They would be crazy not to.\"",

      "body": "<p>The foot and mouth epidemic passed 1,000 cases yesterday but the government's chief scientist, Professor David King, told the prime minister that he believed the worst was over.</p> <p>In a upbeat assessment of the situation, he said that outbreaks were being contained at between 40 to 45 a day compared with 65 to 70 that could be expected if the epidemic was running out of control.</p> <p>At the first scientific briefing to journalists for 10 days he said it was due to the accelerated slaughter policy begun on March 23 when the government first acknowledged foot and mouth was out of control.</p> <p>The worst case scenario of the number of cases doubling every nine days to reach up to 400 cases a day by May 3 was not happening, Prof King said.</p> <p>His briefing was in marked contrast to the views of the army officer in charge of operations in north-east England, around Newcastle, an area that Prof King acknowledged was a new \"hot spot\" for the disease.</p> <p>Lt Colonel Gary Donaldson was quoted in the Northern Echo as saying he did not have enough vets or slaughter teams to cope and that the disease was out of control in the area. \"I cannot wave a magic wand to produce another 150-200 vets,\" he said. \"It is enough to make me weep.\"</p> <p>But yesterday his commanding officer, Brigadier Andrew Farquhar, said: \"It is not out of control but it is a very critical situation. We now have the logistics support in place.\"</p> <p>Prof King revealed that he had briefed the prime minister about the progress of the disease before he made his decision to postpone the elections from May 3 to June 7. He told Mr Blair that by June 7 the epidemic would be fading fast and at worst there would be fewer than five new outbreaks a day.</p> <p>Yesterday, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, the case total had reached 1,019 - with only 28 notified in the last 24 hours.</p> <p>Armed with this advice, Mr Blair yesterday gave MPs a far more upbeat account. He spoke of foot and mouth cases now reaching a \"plateau\" and appealed for the urgent re-opening of most footpaths in time for the Easter break.</p> <p>Mr Blair faced fresh accusations from William Hague that the slaughter and disposal programmes were still lagging, making the spread of disease worse. But Mr Blair insisted that, at 40,000 disposals a week, the rate is more than double what it was two weeks earlier. In some areas, slaughter within 24 hours was 100%, aides said later.</p> <p>Neither the prime minister not his spokesman, Alastair Campbell, risked saying the outbreak is now \"under control.\" Vaccination has currently been ruled out for ordinary farm animals because it is believed the epidemic can be defeated without it. However, last night, the EU vets gave permission for zoo animals and rare breeds to be vaccinated to protect them if they are within 15 miles of an outbreak.</p> <p>Despite official optimism there were worrying new outbreaks yesterday in sensitive areas. Infection was found at a hill farm in the southern Lake District fells near Kendal. \"It is what we have dreaded. It threatens to spread everywhere. It could be a disaster,\" said a national park spokesman.<br> <b>Email update</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/email\">Sign up for our free daily foot and mouth

      "bodyText": "The foot and mouth epidemic passed 1,000 cases yesterday but the government's chief scientist, Professor David King, told the prime minister that he believed the worst was over. In a upbeat assessment of the situation, he said that outbreaks were being contained at between 40 to 45 a day compared with 65 to 70 that could be expected if the epidemic was running out of control. At the first scientific briefing to journalists for 10 days he said it was due to the accelerated slaughter policy begun on March 23 when the government first acknowledged foot and mouth was out of control. The worst case scenario of the number of cases doubling every nine days to reach up to 400 cases a day by May 3 was not happening, Prof King said. His briefing was in marked contrast to the views of the army officer in charge of operations in north-east England, around Newcastle, an area that Prof King acknowledged was a new \"hot spot\" for the disease. Lt Colonel Gary Donaldson was quoted in the Northern Echo as saying he did not have enough vets or slaughter teams to cope and that the disease was out of control in the area. \"I cannot wave a magic wand to produce another 150-200 vets,\" he said. \"It is enough to make me weep.\" But yesterday his commanding officer, Brigadier Andrew Farquhar, said: \"It is not out of control but it is a very critical situation. We now have the logistics support in place.\" Prof King revealed that he had briefed the prime minister about the progress of the disease before he made his decision to postpone the elections from May 3 to June 7. He told Mr Blair that by June 7 the epidemic would be fading fast and at worst there would be fewer than five new outbreaks a day. Yesterday, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, the case total had reached 1,019 - with only 28 notified in the last 24 hours. Armed with this advice, Mr Blair yesterday gave MPs a far more upbeat account. He spoke of foot and mouth cases now reaching a \"plateau\" and appealed for the urgent re-opening of most footpaths in time for the Easter break. Mr Blair faced fresh accusations from William Hague that the slaughter and disposal programmes were still lagging, making the spread of disease worse. But Mr Blair insisted that, at 40,000 disposals a week, the rate is more than double what it was two weeks earlier. In some areas, slaughter within 24 hours was 100%, aides said later. Neither the prime minister not his spokesman, Alastair Campbell, risked saying the outbreak is now \"under control.\" Vaccination has currently been ruled out for ordinary farm animals because it is believed the epidemic can be defeated without it. However, last night, the EU vets gave permission for zoo animals and rare breeds to be vaccinated to protect them if they are within 15 miles of an outbreak. Despite official optimism there were worrying new outbreaks yesterday in sensitive areas. Infection was found at a hill farm in the southern Lake District fells near Kendal. \"It is what we have dreaded. It threatens to spread everywhere. It could be a disaster,\" said a national park spokesman.

The chaos swirling between Maff, Ministry of Defence, Downing Street, Cabinet Office and numerous local authorities, shows how pitifully unequipped any British government is to handle a big emergency. All an opposition leader has to do is judge the tone in which he picks apart the mess. Mr Hague has done that nicely. He has been moderate and constructive. But he is none the better for it. His problems are far deeper. Investigating why he remains the big loser, one lights upon the extraordinary fact that he doesn't even understand what they are.</p> <p>John Major took a decorous crack at him this week, coming to the aid of Ian Taylor, a rare Conservative MP who can plausibly be labelled left of centre. Mr Major once again proclaims the merits of that fabled place of worship and allegiance, the broad church. Every country needs at least two broad churches, with overlapping aisles, if it is to flourish as a democracy. Mr Major evidently fears that Hague has spent four years preaching, by a demonic instinct for self-destruction, to the narrowest sect of the undoubting faithful, with such effect that even the disaster that has overtaken the other side can't make the rest of us begin to listen to him.</p> <p>This is a subject of amazement in the topmost reaches of the Labour party. Politicians whose own upward path began under the leadership of Michael Foot compare Hague unfavourably with that time. Michael, they say, at least knew which side he ought to be on. He fought the hard left, however ineffectively. The ambition of his leadership was to retrieve some of the ground from the zealots. Then Foot begat Neil Kinnock, the originating reformer, and the party was launched towards the condition of being electable.</p> <p>William Hague has treated his zealots in the opposite way. He set out to do nothing except appease them. On every issue that inflames their guts, he has applied the torch. He declines to read them a single lesson in reality, refuses to discomfort them, fears to confront them with reasons for the party's plight, runs away from any search for the centre ground. Major, not Hague, was the Foot of this piece, struggling against the militant minority determined to capture his party. Hague, instead of learning Kinnock's lesson, turns himself to the vain pursuit of satisfying John Redwood and William Cash.</p> <p>So Problem One is cowardice before zealotry. Problem Two is, despite this zeal, a gaping absence of strategic vision. Extremism in the visceral fields is not accompanied by consistency elsewhere. On public spending, Hague has time and again reversed the party line. On tax he once made a plausible promise - to cut it - but then let this dissipate into confusion. His various lines have been part of no ordered philosophical assessment of what modern conservatism means, or how to make it distinctive and relevant. Rhetorically Hague proposes a mistrust of the state. Actually he offers no coherent notion about how the state might be diminished. Psephologically, he proves month by month to be out of touch with the public he is hoping to impress.</p> <p>He is not helped by the Tory press. The newspapers merely fire the zealots up. People say that Tony Blair is over- influenced by the Daily Mail. The charge is now out of date. But it was, in any case, nothing compared with the influence worked on the Conservative leader by the relentlessly Europe- hating, asylum-abominating propaganda from that quarter. The Mail and the Daily Telegraph are the heaviest crosses any Tory leader has to bear who might be searching for the centre ground. At least when Foot was being persecuted, and Kinnock having a difficult time, the progressive press, mainly the Mirror and the Guardian, were not working to savage them for every desertion of the faith. Quite the opposite. The Tory press, instead, takes pleasure in driving its party into the catacombs.</p> <p>Can broad-church Conservatism be rebuilt, so as to make the party the gainers not the losers from some future national calamity? There's defiant talk on the Tory left. They will fight the election quietly, the better to position themselves for a confrontation with Hague as soon as it is over. This is where your hard-line Europhobia and your brutish inhumanity towards a variety of victims have got you, they hope to tell him after the heavy defeat they trust that Mr Blair is about to inflict. Romantics even speak of Chris Patten immediately resigning his place as a European commissioner and crossing the white cliffs to declare himself a candidate to lead his old party back from oblivion.</p> <p>The trouble with this is that anything resembling a Patten constituency has shrunk close to single figures in the electorate that matters. Any parliamentary Conservative party, whether of 160 or 220, will be dominated by hard liners, legatees of this decade of growing sectarianism, which now makes it inadmissible for a pro- Europe Tory to be nominated for a winnable, or indeed any, seat. The great majority of newly nominated candidates now say not merely no but never to the euro: a transgression of the supposed party line that Hague does nothing to reprimand, still less forbid. Such is the measure of his leadership. With the exception of one departing MP, John Townend, there seems to be nothing that any Tory politician says from within the sect that Hague would judge inimical to the party's interests in the world beyond.</p> <p>A measure of its distance from that world is to be found in the intense discussions of his likely successor. These now focus on Michael Portillo as the most credible applicant for what one might call the Patten vote. What a turn-around, what a plight! Mr Portillo is undoubtedly an able man, the most able of any in the field, who also understands the limitations of what has been happening in the past four years. But he is infected with the disease that largely defines the Tory predicament and excludes it from consideration as a party of government: the visceral anti- Europeanism that deforms so much of what else the party might have to say. That Portillo is becoming the candidate of the Tory left shows how truly straitened the gate to salvation has become.</p> <p>The predicament, I think, will not end until the Europe question is resolved, one way or the other. Yet the new emerging battle in the party, waiting to greet any post-election leader, is over how long that resolution can possibly be postponed. If there is a euro referendum, the issue is no longer who fights on which side, but whether the result should be accepted. The ultras, among whom Portillo seems to be one, are preparing to declare the result invalid if it is yes, and to obstruct the single currency, by every possible means, up to the very moment of its birth here.</p> <p>They say that foot and mouth poses no threat to humans. It must be something else eating away at Conservative brains.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:&quot;hugoyoung@compuserve.com&quot;\">hugoyoung@compuserve.com</a></p>",

On public spending, Hague has time and again reversed the party line. On tax he once made a plausible promise - to cut it - but then let this dissipate into confusion. His various lines have been part of no ordered philosophical assessment of what modern conservatism means, or how to make it distinctive and relevant. Rhetorically Hague proposes a mistrust of the state. Actually he offers no coherent notion about how the state might be diminished. Psephologically, he proves month by month to be out of touch with the public he is hoping to impress. He is not helped by the Tory press. The newspapers merely fire the zealots up. People say that Tony Blair is over- influenced by the Daily Mail. The charge is now out of date. But it was, in any case, nothing compared with the influence worked on the Conservative leader by the relentlessly Europe- hating, asylum-abominating propaganda from that quarter. The Mail and the Daily Telegraph are the heaviest crosses any Tory leader has to bear who might be searching for the centre ground. At least when Foot was being persecuted, and Kinnock having a difficult time, the progressive press, mainly the Mirror and the Guardian, were not working to savage them for every desertion of the faith. Quite the opposite. The Tory press, instead, takes pleasure in driving its party into the catacombs. Can broad-church Conservatism be rebuilt, so as to make the party the gainers not the losers from some future national calamity? There's defiant talk on the Tory left. They will fight the election quietly, the better to position themselves for a confrontation with Hague as soon as it is over. This is where your hard-line Europhobia and your brutish inhumanity towards a variety of victims have got you, they hope to tell him after the heavy defeat they trust that Mr Blair is about to inflict. Romantics even speak of Chris Patten immediately resigning his place as a European commissioner and crossing the white cliffs to declare himself a candidate to lead his old party back from oblivion. The trouble with this is that anything resembling a Patten constituency has shrunk close to single figures in the electorate that matters. Any parliamentary Conservative party, whether of 160 or 220, will be dominated by hard liners, legatees of this decade of growing sectarianism, which now makes it inadmissible for a pro- Europe Tory to be nominated for a winnable, or indeed any, seat. The great majority of newly nominated candidates now say not merely no but never to the euro: a transgression of the supposed party line that Hague does nothing to reprimand, still less forbid. Such is the measure of his leadership. With the exception of one departing MP, John Townend, there seems to be nothing that any Tory politician says from within the sect that Hague would judge inimical to the party's interests in the world beyond. A measure of its distance from that world is to be found in the intense discussions of his likely successor. These now focus on Michael Portillo as the most credible applicant for what one might call the Patten vote. What a turn-around, what a plight! Mr Portillo is undoubtedly an able man, the most able of any in the field, who also understands the limitations of what has been happening in the past four years. But he is infected with the disease that largely defines the Tory predicament and excludes it from consideration as a party of government: the visceral anti- Europeanism that deforms so much of what else the party might have to say. That Portillo is becoming the candidate of the Tory left shows how truly straitened the gate to salvation has become. The predicament, I think, will not end until the Europe question is resolved, one way or the other. Yet the new emerging battle in the party, waiting to greet any post-election leader, is over how long that resolution can possibly be postponed. If there is a euro referendum, the issue is no longer who fights on which side, but whether the result should be accepted. The ultras, among whom Portillo seems to be one, are preparing to declare the result invalid if it is yes, and to obstruct the single currency, by every possible means, up to the very moment of its birth here. They say that foot and mouth poses no threat to humans. It must be something else eating away at Conservative brains. hugoyoung@compuserve.com",

As leader of Bosnia's Serbs during the killings and ethnic cleansing of the early 90s, he is one of the men most wanted by the International War Crimes Tribunal in the Hague.</p> <p>The arms for sale, mostly leftovers from the Bosnian Serb and Yugoslav armed forces and police, include Kalashnikov rifles, M-84 machine guns, M-50 grenades, pistols, explosives and detonators. Night sights and telescopic sights for snipers are also on offer.</p> <p>A gang of arms traffickers, led by a Karadzic ally, Veljko Borovina, showed the Spaniards exploding bullets, banned by international treaties.</p> <p>They said they could also get armoured cars and even helicopters, through contacts in the Yugoslav military and the Bosnian Serb army.</p> <p>The traffickers said that Mr Karadzic's relation was a major arms smuggler who had sold weapons to the Real IRA through Germany. He is believed to be in hiding.</p> <p>\"[He] is totally trustworthy. During the war he trafficked in alcohol, tobacco and arms to finance the Serb army. He has the very best contacts and has sold to the IRA,\" explained Lario, one of the gang members who led the documentary team to the Bosnian Serb town of Sokolac.</p> <p>The film makers from El Mundo TV, a production company owned by the Madrid daily El Mundo, posed as drug traffickers buying for paramilitary groups in Colombia.</p> <p>They started their search for arms in Spain by contacting a well known Croatian gangster with property there. They were passed to a series of Balkan mafia contacts, whom they filmed secretly. The trail led to Budapest in Hungary and on to Bosnia - first Sarajevo, then Kiseljak and, finally, Sokolac.</p> <p>There they were taken into a forest by Mr Borovina, who is wanted by police in connection with the murder of a former Bosnian Serb police chief Ljubisa Savic - a Karadzic opponent.</p> <p>Mr Borovina invited his supposed buyers to try out a large range of weaponry.</p> <p>\"We've got Kalashnikovs, machine guns, pistols, grenades, whatever you want,\" he explained. \"These bullets can penetrate a bullet-proof vest and rip it to pieces,\" he said, showing a hollow bullet banned by international treaties.</p> <p>He also said he could supply bullets that carry chemicals, which are also banned under international law.</p> <p>The traffickers explained that most of the weapons had once belonged to the Bosnian Serb army. So many weapons were now on the market, they added, that prices were half the original: a Kalashnikov at \u00a3320, an M-84 machine gun at \u00a3800. The traffickers agreed a price equalling \u00a31.5m for 200 Kalashnikovs, 75 M-84s, 500 pistols, 50 sniper rifles with telescopic sights, half a tonne of TNT, 1,000 crates of ammunition and 5,000 grenades. Payment was to be made half in cash and half in cocaine.</p> <p>In Britain, Ulster Unionist MPs recently claimed that Real IRA members were posing as charity workers to travel to the former Yugoslavia to buy arms.</p> <p>The rocket-propelled grenade launcher used in last September's attack on the MI6 head quarters in London is believed to have been made by Yugoslav Defence Industries and sold by Serbs to the Real IRA. Ireland's Gardai police force discovered last year that the Real IRA had sophisticated Russian RPG18 launchers whose rockets can pierce tank armour.</p> <p>Last July Croatian police discovered an arms haul destined for the Real IRA that included 10 RPG18s in the town of Dobranje, on the border with Bosnia. A similar shipment, also thought to be destined for Northern Ireland, was found in Slovenia.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Allies of Radovan Karadzic,the Bosnian Serb leader charged with war crimes by the Hague tribunal, are supplying arms to the Real IRA and other extremist groups across Europe from hideaways in the Serb part of Bosnia, according to a Spanish documentary team that has filmed the Bosnian Serb arms traffickers in action. Their film - broadcast last night on Spain's third channel, Antena 3 - alleges that a relation of Mr Karadzic, and others in the family's coterie are behind a trade that has turned the Bosnian Serb Republic into an international arms depot supplying groups that include the Real IRA and the Eta Basque bombers. The weaponry is shipped through Kosovo, Croatia, and Germany to Ireland and other countries around the world, the Spanish film reports. The illicit trade is carried on under the nose of the Nato-led S-For peace force in Bosnia. Nato has been consistently criticised for failing to arrest Mr Karadzic. As leader of Bosnia's Serbs during the killings and ethnic cleansing of the early 90s, he is one of the men most wanted by the International War Crimes Tribunal in the Hague. The arms for sale, mostly leftovers from the Bosnian Serb and Yugoslav armed forces and police, include Kalashnikov rifles, M-84 machine guns, M-50 grenades, pistols, explosives and detonators. Night sights and telescopic sights for snipers are also on offer. A gang of arms traffickers, led by a Karadzic ally, Veljko Borovina, showed the Spaniards exploding bullets, banned by international treaties. They said they could also get armoured cars and even helicopters, through contacts in the Yugoslav military and the Bosnian Serb army. The traffickers said that Mr Karadzic's relation was a major arms smuggler who had sold weapons to the Real IRA through Germany. He is believed to be in hiding. \"[He] is totally trustworthy. During the war he trafficked in alcohol, tobacco and arms to finance the Serb army. He has the very best contacts and has sold to the IRA,\" explained Lario, one of the gang members who led the documentary team to the Bosnian Serb town of Sokolac. The film makers from El Mundo TV, a production company owned by the Madrid daily El Mundo, posed as drug traffickers buying for paramilitary groups in Colombia. They started their search for arms in Spain by contacting a well known Croatian gangster with property there. They were passed to a series of Balkan mafia contacts, whom they filmed secretly. The trail led to Budapest in Hungary and on to Bosnia - first Sarajevo, then Kiseljak and, finally, Sokolac. There they were taken into a forest by Mr Borovina, who is wanted by police in connection with the murder of a former Bosnian Serb police chief Ljubisa Savic - a Karadzic opponent. Mr Borovina invited his supposed buyers to try out a large range of weaponry. \"We've got Kalashnikovs, machine guns, pistols, grenades, whatever you want,\" he explained. \"These bullets can penetrate a bullet-proof vest and rip it to pieces,\" he said, showing a hollow bullet banned by international treaties. He also said he could supply bullets that carry chemicals, which are also banned under international law. The traffickers explained that most of the weapons had once belonged to the Bosnian Serb army. So many weapons were now on the market, they added, that prices were half the original: a Kalashnikov at \u00a3320, an M-84 machine gun at \u00a3800. The traffickers agreed a price equalling \u00a31.5m for 200 Kalashnikovs, 75 M-84s, 500 pistols, 50 sniper rifles with telescopic sights, half a tonne of TNT, 1,000 crates of ammunition and 5,000 grenades. Payment was to be made half in cash and half in cocaine. In Britain, Ulster Unionist MPs recently claimed that Real IRA members were posing as charity workers to travel to the former Yugoslavia to buy arms. The rocket-propelled grenade launcher used in last September's attack on the MI6 head quarters in London is believed to have been made by Yugoslav Defence Industries and sold by Serbs to the Real IRA. Ireland's Gardai police force discovered last year that the Real IRA had sophisticated Russian RPG18 launchers whose rockets can pierce tank armour. Last July Croatian police discovered an arms haul destined for the Real IRA that included 10 RPG18s in the town of Dobranje, on the border with Bosnia. A similar shipment, also thought to be destined for Northern Ireland, was found in Slovenia.",

While more than 80% of American hi-tech companies have given profits warnings in the last few months, Surfcontrol was able to report better than expected third quarter results and said it had yet to be hit by the US economic slowdown. Turnover for the third quarter rose 200% to $11.1m, but the group's losses also widened as a result of its continued expansion programme. The firm made a pretax loss of $60m in the nine months to the end of February, up from $16m last year. \"Since the period end, trading has progressed well and we believe that we will have a successful outcome to the full year\", said Steve Purdham, the chief executive. Surfcontrol's shares, which dropped 112.5p on Tuesday, jumped 22.5p to 345p. Analysts were upbeat about the results; one described the figures as a \"cracking set of numbers\" and said investors should take advantage of the company's present weak share price.",

      "body": "<p>Two independent teams of scientists believe that the foot and mouth outbreak has reached a plateau and the daily tally of cases will begin to fall, the government's chief scientist, David King, said yesterday.</p> <p>Key to containing the epidemic was slaughtering infected animals as quickly as possible, and this alone was beginning to turn the situation around, he said.</p> <p>New outbreaks were running at 40 to 45 a day, compared with the 65 to 70 a day that would have been expected if the slaughter policy was not working.</p> <p>Professor King said that as a result of the more optimistic forecasts the option of vaccinating 180,000 cattle in Cumbria and Devon had been dropped, at least for the time being. In a week it would possible to confirm whether the disease had peaked.</p> <p>The rate at which infected animals were being killed was accelerating, even though there were still 380,000 animals awaiting slaughter. The vast majority of these were healthy animals on neighbouring farms which would have to killed as a \"fire wall.\" The urgency was not so great in these cases, but it was hoped that all would be killed within 48 hours of their neighbours getting an outbreak.</p> <p>On March 23, when foot and mouth was first acknowledged to be out of control and scientists believed the outbreaks might reach as many as 400 a day, it was taking 2.8 to 3 days to slaughter infected animals and up to a week to kill potential contacts.</p> <p>This had been cut to 1.5 days or better for infected animals. This alone had brought down the number of outbreaks, and if the time was reduced even further the epidemic would tail off sharply.</p> <p>Prof King said the teams of epidemiologists from Imperial College London and Cambridge had given the government clear advice on how to contain the outbreak.</p> <p>\"They have been working entirely independently and come up with remarkably similar results. This [has] given us a fantastic science base, and we can make policy decisions.\"</p> <p>He said the scientists had been pessimistic because so far this spring the weather had favoured the virus. \"If rain and cold continue, the virus can survive and spread more easily, but warm sunshine kills it.\"</p> <p>The main problems for the government remained the \"hot spots\" of disease, where the spread continued. Cumbria and Dumfries and Galloway had always been the worst, followed by Devon, Mid Wales, Hereford, Gloucestershire and the area north of Birmingham.</p> <p>In the past two weeks two new areas close to Newcastle upon Tyne had emerged. \"We have established a new command and control centre in Newcastle to kill all infected animals as quickly as possible.\"</p> <p>In Cumbria the government was continuing to slaughter animals to the south of the main outbreak to protect the fells. This would be a special fire wall.</p> <p>The policy of killing everything within two miles of an outbreak had been abandoned elsewhere as too difficult; there were just too many animals involved. The work of the scientists showed that the most important action was to take out all the animals on neighbouring farms. This meant on average that for every one infected farm there were four to six neighbours.</p> <p>Teams of scientist advisers were being sent all over the country in the next few days to explain to farmers what the government was trying to achieve, Prof King said. \"If they understand the science and how it is working, then together we can defeat this thing. Their cooperation has been vital so far.\"</p> <p>Ian Gardiner, deputy director of the National Farmers Union, said: \"It does look on this evidence as if the epidemic has peaked. But it is too early to relax; we need to keep working at it, however painful it is.\"</p> <p><b>Email update</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/email\">Sign up for our free daily

      "bodyText": "Two independent teams of scientists believe that the foot and mouth outbreak has reached a plateau and the daily tally of cases will begin to fall, the government's chief scientist, David King, said yesterday. Key to containing the epidemic was slaughtering infected animals as quickly as possible, and this alone was beginning to turn the situation around, he said. New outbreaks were running at 40 to 45 a day, compared with the 65 to 70 a day that would have been expected if the slaughter policy was not working. Professor King said that as a result of the more optimistic forecasts the option of vaccinating 180,000 cattle in Cumbria and Devon had been dropped, at least for the time being. In a week it would possible to confirm whether the disease had peaked. The rate at which infected animals were being killed was accelerating, even though there were still 380,000 animals awaiting slaughter. The vast majority of these were healthy animals on neighbouring farms which would have to killed as a \"fire wall.\" The urgency was not so great in these cases, but it was hoped that all would be killed within 48 hours of their neighbours getting an outbreak. On March 23, when foot and mouth was first acknowledged to be out of control and scientists believed the outbreaks might reach as many as 400 a day, it was taking 2.8 to 3 days to slaughter infected animals and up to a week to kill potential contacts. This had been cut to 1.5 days or better for infected animals. This alone had brought down the number of outbreaks, and if the time was reduced even further the epidemic would tail off sharply. Prof King said the teams of epidemiologists from Imperial College London and Cambridge had given the government clear advice on how to contain the outbreak. \"They have been working entirely independently and come up with remarkably similar results. This [has] given us a fantastic science base, and we can make policy decisions.\" He said the scientists had been pessimistic because so far this spring the weather had favoured the virus. \"If rain and cold continue, the virus can survive and spread more easily, but warm sunshine kills it.\" The main problems for the government remained the \"hot spots\" of disease, where the spread continued. Cumbria and Dumfries and Galloway had always been the worst, followed by Devon, Mid Wales, Hereford, Gloucestershire and the area north of Birmingham. In the past two weeks two new areas close to Newcastle upon Tyne had emerged. \"We have established a new command and control centre in Newcastle to kill all infected animals as quickly as possible.\" In Cumbria the government was continuing to slaughter animals to the south of the main outbreak to protect the fells. This would be a special fire wall. The policy of killing everything within two miles of an outbreak had been abandoned elsewhere as too difficult; there were just too many animals involved. The work of the scientists showed that the most important action was to take out all the animals on neighbouring farms. This meant on average that for every one infected farm there were four to six neighbours. Teams of scientist advisers were being sent all over the country in the next few days to explain to farmers what the government was trying to achieve, Prof King said. \"If they understand the science and how it is working, then together we can defeat this thing. Their cooperation has been vital so far.\" Ian Gardiner, deputy director of the National Farmers Union, said: \"It does look on this evidence as if the epidemic has peaked. But it is too early to relax; we need to keep working at it, however painful it is.\" Email update Sign up for our free daily foot and mouth round-up More on the election and foot and mouth Politics: foot and mouth What's going on?

They pumped out only news, in protest at Tuesday's sudden boardroom coup and takeover of the channel by the Kremlin-backed Gazprom corporation, Russia's biggest company.</p> <p>There were no game shows, no soap operas, no movies, no police serials, just Mr Norkin and his fellow newscaster, Svetlana Sorokina, reading the news, interspersed with NTV's live coverage of its own sit in.</p> <p>Roman Borkov, 25, an NTV news producer, sat in front of a bank of TV monitors feeding the videos into the whirring machines and directing the cameras.</p> <p>\"It's pretty weird. I've never done this before,\" he said. \"We're only broadcasting what's going on within these corridors.\"</p> <p>Mr Norkin and the rebellious NTV staff have suddenly been pitched into the biggest battle for freedom of the press that Russia has seen in the decade since communism collapsed.</p> <p>The stand-off is the result of a year-long saga pitting Gazprom, seen as a Kremlin proxy, against Vladimir Gusinsky, the exiled mogul who founded the station eight years ago. During that time he put together what is arguably the most talented and most professional team of journalists working in Russia. It is also the only important TV channel in the country which does not dance to the Kremlin's tune.</p> <p>On Tuesday Gazprom, which owns 46% of NTV, called a snap shareholders' meeting, and engineered a putsch of the board, from which they removed Mr Gusinsky and the NTV chief and top journalist, Yevgeny Kiselev. The agents of Gazprom installed a new management trio - with their own Alfred Kokh as chairman, Boris Jordan, a US banker, as NTV chief, and Vladimir Kulistikov, head of the state news agency RIA Novosti, as the channel's editor.</p> <p>Still sitting in his director-general's office orchestrating the rebellion yesterday, Mr Kiselev said bluntly: \"I'm not going to work with Kokh. I won't even shake his hand. He's just a toy in the hands of [President Vladimir] Putin.\"</p> <p>It is this kind of unbridled criticism of Russia's powerful, and its exposure of corruption in high places, that have earned NTV the enmity of the Kremlin.</p> <p>With his 1995 International Press Freedom award pinned to the wall behind him, Mr Kiselev vowed that the \"civil disobedience\" campaign he is leading would go on. Sweating heavily, eyes bloodshot, palpably exhausted, the normally dapper TV chief spat his contempt for the new managers.</p> <p>\"Kokh can come in and take over this office. But is he going to read the news, report from parliament, host talk shows? Because no one here is going to do that for him.\"</p> <p>It's a view that is echoed in the corridors outside his office, as tired camera crews, technicians, secretaries, and journalists chainsmoked through the afternoon in adrenaline-driven, coffee-fuelled solidarity. They expect a police raid at any time to evict them.</p> <p>\"Kokh and Jordan have broken the law as far as we're concerned,\" Grigory Krichevsky, director of news programmes, said. \"They can come here, but all they're going to find is empty rooms and empty boxes. No one will pay them any attention and no one will work with them.\"</p> <p>These tactics are to be applied with military rigour.</p> <p>\"This is not about money, it's about convictions and freedom of thought, about ideas,\" Mr Borkov said.</p> <p>\"And it's got nothing to do with Gusinsky, it's about our TV company,\" said Ms Sorokina, whose famously demure screen presence has melted away to reveal a forceful personality.</p> <p>As TV professionals, they have a keen talent for the theatrical and the dramatic, precious weapons being deployed in the national hearts-and-minds campaign to save the station.</p> <p>The men in suits from Gazprom might have the big money and political backers, but they are losing the propaganda battle.</p> <p>Liberal politicians paraded through the studios yesterday, providing more soundbites which were instantly fed into the live broadcasts. The last Soviet president, Mikhail Gorbachev, pronounced the hostile takeover a disgrace and \"a challenge to all of society\".</p> <p>He said he wanted to discuss the matter with President Putin, suggesting that, as ever in Russia, the Tsar was being misled by his courtiers. Mr Kiselev, however insists that the whole crisis has been engineered \"on the orders of the Tsar\".</p> <p>What will happen next in this drama is less than clear. Gazprom has called another emergency NTV board meeting for tomorrow.</p> <p>Mr Norkin, meanwhile, will light another cigarette, fix a stray hair or two and face the cameras to read the latest news about Russia's real-life television drama.</p> <p><b> Ted Turner steps in</b><br></p> <p>The tug-of-war to decide NTV's future could hinge on the US mogul and CNN founder, Ted Turner, who claimed last night to have been offered most of Vladimir Gusinsky's media holding company for $225m (\u00a3157m), writes Ian Traynor .</p> <p>The company includes newspapers and magazines, a Moscow radio station, and 49% of NTV. But the deal is far from done.</p> <p>A western consortium of investors, led by Mr Turner, and including the US financier George Soros and a Swedish media magnate, has been in negotiations for months.</p> <p>Sources close to Mr Gusinsky said yesterday that only a memorandum of understanding had been agreed. The deal's approval appeared to depend on talks scheduled for next week.</p> <p>CNN said yesterday that Mr Turner would only proceed if he could hire and fire the TV channel's board and management.</p> <p>He said that the US banker, Boris Jordan, just appointed NTV chief by Gazprom, would have to go, CNN reported.</p>",

I've never done this before,\" he said. \"We're only broadcasting what's going on within these corridors.\" Mr Norkin and the rebellious NTV staff have suddenly been pitched into the biggest battle for freedom of the press that Russia has seen in the decade since communism collapsed. The stand-off is the result of a year-long saga pitting Gazprom, seen as a Kremlin proxy, against Vladimir Gusinsky, the exiled mogul who founded the station eight years ago. During that time he put together what is arguably the most talented and most professional team of journalists working in Russia. It is also the only important TV channel in the country which does not dance to the Kremlin's tune. On Tuesday Gazprom, which owns 46% of NTV, called a snap shareholders' meeting, and engineered a putsch of the board, from which they removed Mr Gusinsky and the NTV chief and top journalist, Yevgeny Kiselev. The agents of Gazprom installed a new management trio - with their own Alfred Kokh as chairman, Boris Jordan, a US banker, as NTV chief, and Vladimir Kulistikov, head of the state news agency RIA Novosti, as the channel's editor. Still sitting in his director-general's office orchestrating the rebellion yesterday, Mr Kiselev said bluntly: \"I'm not going to work with Kokh. I won't even shake his hand. He's just a toy in the hands of [President Vladimir] Putin.\" It is this kind of unbridled criticism of Russia's powerful, and its exposure of corruption in high places, that have earned NTV the enmity of the Kremlin. With his 1995 International Press Freedom award pinned to the wall behind him, Mr Kiselev vowed that the \"civil disobedience\" campaign he is leading would go on. Sweating heavily, eyes bloodshot, palpably exhausted, the normally dapper TV chief spat his contempt for the new managers. \"Kokh can come in and take over this office. But is he going to read the news, report from parliament, host talk shows? Because no one here is going to do that for him.\" It's a view that is echoed in the corridors outside his office, as tired camera crews, technicians, secretaries, and journalists chainsmoked through the afternoon in adrenaline-driven, coffee-fuelled solidarity. They expect a police raid at any time to evict them. \"Kokh and Jordan have broken the law as far as we're concerned,\" Grigory Krichevsky, director of news programmes, said. \"They can come here, but all they're going to find is empty rooms and empty boxes. No one will pay them any attention and no one will work with them.\" These tactics are to be applied with military rigour. \"This is not about money, it's about convictions and freedom of thought, about ideas,\" Mr Borkov said. \"And it's got nothing to do with Gusinsky, it's about our TV company,\" said Ms Sorokina, whose famously demure screen presence has melted away to reveal a forceful personality. As TV professionals, they have a keen talent for the theatrical and the dramatic, precious weapons being deployed in the national hearts-and-minds campaign to save the station. The men in suits from Gazprom might have the big money and political backers, but they are losing the propaganda battle. Liberal politicians paraded through the studios yesterday, providing more soundbites which were instantly fed into the live broadcasts. The last Soviet president, Mikhail Gorbachev, pronounced the hostile takeover a disgrace and \"a challenge to all of society\". He said he wanted to discuss the matter with President Putin, suggesting that, as ever in Russia, the Tsar was being misled by his courtiers. Mr Kiselev, however insists that the whole crisis has been engineered \"on the orders of the Tsar\". What will happen next in this drama is less than clear. Gazprom has called another emergency NTV board meeting for tomorrow. Mr Norkin, meanwhile, will light another cigarette, fix a stray hair or two and face the cameras to read the latest news about Russia's real-life television drama. Ted Turner steps in The tug-of-war to decide NTV's future could hinge on the US mogul and CNN founder, Ted Turner, who claimed last night to have been offered most of Vladimir Gusinsky's media holding company for $225m (\u00a3157m), writes Ian Traynor . The company includes newspapers and magazines, a Moscow radio station, and 49% of NTV. But the deal is far from done. A western consortium of investors, led by Mr Turner, and including the US financier George Soros and a Swedish media magnate, has been in negotiations for months. Sources close to Mr Gusinsky said yesterday that only a memorandum of understanding had been agreed. The deal's approval appeared to depend on talks scheduled for next week. CNN said yesterday that Mr Turner would only proceed if he could hire and fire the TV channel's board and management. He said that the US banker, Boris Jordan, just appointed NTV chief by Gazprom, would have to go, CNN reported.",

      "bodyText": "Express owner Richard Desmond is holding a crunch meeting with Telegraph owner Hollinger International today, as the multimillion pound dispute over the Westferry printing plant reaches boiling point. Mr Desmond's Northern &amp; Shell company, which co-owns the plant with Hollinger, is set to ignore today's deadline of paying an outstanding \u00a38m printing bill. Sources close to the Westferry board, which is dominated by Hollinger executives, said a writ will be slapped on Northern &amp; Shell if it refused to pay up. \"We hope the talks will produce a payment of the bill, but if they do not legal action will be taken,\" said one source. Mr Desmond is refusing to settle the bill until he is paid the \u00a311m dividend he believes Northern &amp; Shell is owed as a shareholder in the company. However, Hollinger is refusing to authorise this payment until Northern &amp; Shell supplies a budget for its contribution to the plant. According to the Westferry source, the stalemate could threaten the long-term future of the plant, which prints the southern editions of the Daily Telegraph, the Financial Times, the Express newspapers and the Guardian. \"If the dispute goes on long enough, Westferry will run out of cash. You cannot run a business if a major source of revenue is being withheld,\" the source added. Sources close to Northern &amp; Shell dismissed the legal threat, saying the squabble should be settled outside the courts. \"They will sort it out. I would be very surprised if a writ was issued,\" the source said. The dividend row is overshadowing a long-standing dispute between Northern &amp; Shell and Hollinger, in which the Telegraph owner is trying to buy Mr Desmond's 50% stake in the business. Mr Desmond inherited the holding when he paid Lord Hollick's United Business Media \u00a3125m for the Express newspapers in November last year. Both parties are poles apart in valuation, with Northern &amp; Shell demanding \u00a380m and Hollinger offering just \u00a330m. The price will now be settled by an independent arbitrator, who will be appointed over the next few weeks. Jeremy Deedes, managing director of the Telegraph Group, said it will make a decision on the stake as soon as the arbitrator comes up with a price. \"The process of appointing an arbitrator is still going on, and this will lead to a price being fixed. Then the Telegraph group will consider whether or not to buy the stake,\" said Mr Deedes. Related stories Special report: Express takeover",

      "body": "<p>This week Britain managed second from bottom place in a worldwide survey of broadband internet access. According to Netvalue, an IT research house, the UK lags far behind South Korea, the US, Hong Kong and the leading European economies, with only China faring worse out of the 11 countries profiled. </p> <p>It is news that should embarrass the government, which says it wants the UK to have the \"most competitive and extensive broadband market\" of the G7 countries by 2005. But the survey simply confirms what those of us who have attempted to sign up to broadband internet access have known for some time. The situation is desperate, and shows no sign of improving fast. </p> <p>My quest for broadband began one spring afternoon last year. It was a day of hope, almost a year ago now. It seems much longer. </p> <p>That morning I swallowed my scepticism and, through BT's website, \"registered my interest\" in ADSL, the technology which takes an ordinary phone line and turbo charges it for internet access. </p> <p>I, and thousands like me, hoped to wave bye bye to the dull old world wide wait, an au revoir to jerky streaming video and tinny sound. Even if we had to rely on lumbering old BT to deliver it. </p> <p>Right on cue, an evangelistic book by technology vision ary George Gilder came out, giving us an even clearer idea of why broadband would really matter. In Telecosm - How Infinite Bandwidth will Revolutionise our World, Gilder looked beyond the go-faster stripes of broadband and saw a world transformed by a surplus of bandwidth - that invisible commodity that allows computers to talk to each other. </p> <p>To paraphrase Gilder (badly), abundant bandwidth - through the air, over wires, or from the heavens - is the Next Big Thing. </p> <p>It is not just something that makes the internet go faster. It makes the internet go so much faster it changes the online world's very nature: it is the electronic penicillin, capable of curing all manner of ills in commerce, bringing new knowledge to millions and changing the way we entertain ourselves. </p> <p>This is not to say Gilder has bought into the broadband we are being urged to aspire to in Britain today. In fact, despite the advertising millions being devoted to the various \"broadband\" offerings of BT, NTL and Telewest, what's on offer would not meet Gilder's definition of the word. </p> <p>The 0.5Mbps (megabits per second) links of ADSL or cable modems might run at around 10 times the speed of the best dial-up modems, but they are just the forerunners of what Gilder reckons is needed for the Telecosm to come about. In Gilder's broadband world we will have bandwidth to squander, in bringing about the great changes he foresees. </p> <p>If Gilder's previous predictions are anything to go by, his technological dream becomes reality far more quickly than you might expect. A decade ago he described the Microcosm, where many components of the physical world would be transferred to a digital state, and much of what he predicted has since happened, right on cue. </p> <p>The problem is, while Silicon Valley could deliver the Microcosm to the world, the Telecosm relies on local players like BT and NTL.

      "bodyText": "This week Britain managed second from bottom place in a worldwide survey of broadband internet access. According to Netvalue, an IT research house, the UK lags far behind South Korea, the US, Hong Kong and the leading European economies, with only China faring worse out of the 11 countries profiled. It is news that should embarrass the government, which says it wants the UK to have the \"most competitive and extensive broadband market\" of the G7 countries by 2005. But the survey simply confirms what those of us who have attempted to sign up to broadband internet access have known for some time. The situation is desperate, and shows no sign of improving fast. My quest for broadband began one spring afternoon last year. It was a day of hope, almost a year ago now. It seems much longer. That morning I swallowed my scepticism and, through BT's website, \"registered my interest\" in ADSL, the technology which takes an ordinary phone line and turbo charges it for internet access. I, and thousands like me, hoped to wave bye bye to the dull old world wide wait, an au revoir to jerky streaming video and tinny sound. Even if we had to rely on lumbering old BT to deliver it. Right on cue, an evangelistic book by technology vision ary George Gilder came out, giving us an even clearer idea of why broadband would really matter. In Telecosm - How Infinite Bandwidth will Revolutionise our World, Gilder looked beyond the go-faster stripes of broadband and saw a world transformed by a surplus of bandwidth - that invisible commodity that allows computers to talk to each other. To paraphrase Gilder (badly), abundant bandwidth - through the air, over wires, or from the heavens - is the Next Big Thing. It is not just something that makes the internet go faster. It makes the internet go so much faster it changes the online world's very nature: it is the electronic penicillin, capable of curing all manner of ills in commerce, bringing new knowledge to millions and changing the way we entertain ourselves. This is not to say Gilder has bought into the broadband we are being urged to aspire to in Britain today. In fact, despite the advertising millions being devoted to the various \"broadband\" offerings of BT, NTL and Telewest, what's on offer would not meet Gilder's definition of the word. The 0.5Mbps (megabits per second) links of ADSL or cable modems might run at around 10 times the speed of the best dial-up modems, but they are just the forerunners of what Gilder reckons is needed for the Telecosm to come about. In Gilder's broadband world we will have bandwidth to squander, in bringing about the great changes he foresees. If Gilder's previous predictions are anything to go by, his technological dream becomes reality far more quickly than you might expect. A decade ago he described the Microcosm, where many components of the physical world would be transferred to a digital state, and much of what he predicted has since happened, right on cue. The problem is, while Silicon Valley could deliver the Microcosm to the world, the Telecosm relies on local players like BT and NTL. And that is where things begin to go wrong. Here at Online, we hear tales every week of readers being frustrated in their attempts to get ADSL or a cable modem. My experiences are no different: all BT has done with my details since that optimistic day last year is lose them to hackers, thanks to a website security glitch. By the end of last year, my mind was beginning to turn to my local cable company, NTL.

A police spokesman said that the matter, which has been referred to the health and safety executive, was being treated as an industrial accident.</p> <p>Paramedics were called to Great Orton to treat the slaughterman.

It was Britain's 1,000th foot and mouth case and cars slowed down beside the field to let their occupants have a look. Foot and mouth case number 1,000 was confirmed yesterday in the heart of an area known as Cumbria's \"carcass production line\". Gordon and Alice Moffat's dairy farm was one mile from the army's foot and mouth slaughter and burial pit. The nearest infected farm was 500 yards away and pyres burned all around. Cumbria accounts for nearly half the total cases in Britain. The fields in the north of the county are empty. Despite the government's efforts, the Moffats said they knew it would get them. \"We were surrounded,\" they said. On their farm the wind could blow three ways bringing differing smells: rotting flesh, burning fleece, or now the meaty stench of their own dead animals. It was the smell, villagers said, of \"all your Sunday dinners at once\". Yesterday disinfectant turned the air acid. A neighbour was in tears at her front door. A young driver eased past in a Mercedes and retched. The Moffats had a 150 acre farm with 260 sheep and 125 cattle. Foot and mouth was confirmed yesterday morning. By the afternoon the neighbouring fields were so silent vets could be heard snapping plastic gloves off their hands at the gates. Then stun guns sounded across fields, in corrugated sheds.

      "bodyText": "A Cumbrian pub chain said yesterday that its sales were flat due to the impact of foot and mouth on the number of visitors to rural areas. Jennings Brothers, based in Cockermouth in Cumbria, said that half its 175 pubs were in areas heavily affected by government restrictions. Some of the pubs could not be reached due to the restrictions; others had suffered due to the decline in visitors. The firm's finance director, John Houghton, said the epidemic had not had a \"material effect\" on trading in the financial year to March 3. But he thought the chain could suffer in the coming months, particularly over the Easter and August Bank Holiday weekends - its busiest periods. He said he hoped people would listen to the government's message urging tourists back to parts of the countryside unaffected by the crisis. \"There is lots to do here without going walking in the hills. Research shows that walking is only the third most popular countryside activity - the first is visiting towns and interesting places. \"When you come to the Lake District you say you will go walking, but most people tend to spend their time in the pub.\" Jennings Brothers' share price fell 7%, or 10p, to 130p after the statement.

      "body": "<p>The government and NFU leaders are holding their breath that the foot and mouth epidemic has peaked in Britain - but it may just be starting in the two most visited national parks and some of the most remote but treasured upland areas.</p> <p>Yesterday, as the army admitted there was a possibility that the disease had reached the high fell flocks, there was a confirmed outbreak at a hill farm at Selside in the heart of the southern Lake District near Windermere, and a suspected case in the Peak District national park.</p> <p>\"This what we have been dreading,\" said Bob Cartwright, head of management with the Lake District national park authority. \"We fear that that we may now lose a whole farming system and a cultural landscape.\"</p> <p>There have so far been two other outbreaks in the park in the Duddon Valley, and several right on the northern and western edges. None are believed to have infected upland sheep.</p> <p>But yesterday's outbreak was at Forest Farm, near Kendal, which has grazing rights over thousands of acres of open moorlands and has \"rough fell\" sheep, a distinct but endangered breed.</p> <p>Lieutenant Colonel Gary Donaldson, who is in charge of the army's response in the north-east, said: \"Our intelligence tells us foot and mouth is on the fells and we have lost them.\"</p> <p>The Moorland Association, which represents the owners of 750,000 acres of English upland areas, yesterday joined leading British conservationists and ecologists and the Peak and Lake national park authorities in calling for urgent vaccination.</p> <p>Yesterday the National Trust, which has also called for vaccination, said that up to 7,000 of its \"hefted\" flocks (sheep which live permanently on the moor) had so far been culled.</p> <p>The Lowther estate, one of the largest landowners in Cumbria, said that the Selside outbreak meant that its 4,500 acre Abbey Farm, which has 2,500 hefted sheep and takes in much of Shap Fell, may now have to be culled. It is estimated that up to to a third of the hefted flocks in Cumbria have already been killed or condemned.</p> <p>The Rare Breeds Survival Trust said it was planning to take emergency measures to protect six breeds of sheep which were under threat from the cull.</p> <p>The suspected case of foot and mouth in the Peak District national park, which has been so far free of the disease, could devastate the park, according to the farmer whose premises are being inspected again.</p> <p>Spray House Farm in Little Hayfield has 2,000 sheep, which roam on around 2,600 acres of hill with the potential to wander on a further 20,000 acres.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Peak District national park authority said it was still planned to reopen trails within the park.

      "bodyText": "The government and NFU leaders are holding their breath that the foot and mouth epidemic has peaked in Britain - but it may just be starting in the two most visited national parks and some of the most remote but treasured upland areas. Yesterday, as the army admitted there was a possibility that the disease had reached the high fell flocks, there was a confirmed outbreak at a hill farm at Selside in the heart of the southern Lake District near Windermere, and a suspected case in the Peak District national park. \"This what we have been dreading,\" said Bob Cartwright, head of management with the Lake District national park authority. \"We fear that that we may now lose a whole farming system and a cultural landscape.\" There have so far been two other outbreaks in the park in the Duddon Valley, and several right on the northern and western edges. None are believed to have infected upland sheep. But yesterday's outbreak was at Forest Farm, near Kendal, which has grazing rights over thousands of acres of open moorlands and has \"rough fell\" sheep, a distinct but endangered breed. Lieutenant Colonel Gary Donaldson, who is in charge of the army's response in the north-east, said: \"Our intelligence tells us foot and mouth is on the fells and we have lost them.\" The Moorland Association, which represents the owners of 750,000 acres of English upland areas, yesterday joined leading British conservationists and ecologists and the Peak and Lake national park authorities in calling for urgent vaccination. Yesterday the National Trust, which has also called for vaccination, said that up to 7,000 of its \"hefted\" flocks (sheep which live permanently on the moor) had so far been culled. The Lowther estate, one of the largest landowners in Cumbria, said that the Selside outbreak meant that its 4,500 acre Abbey Farm, which has 2,500 hefted sheep and takes in much of Shap Fell, may now have to be culled. It is estimated that up to to a third of the hefted flocks in Cumbria have already been killed or condemned. The Rare Breeds Survival Trust said it was planning to take emergency measures to protect six breeds of sheep which were under threat from the cull. The suspected case of foot and mouth in the Peak District national park, which has been so far free of the disease, could devastate the park, according to the farmer whose premises are being inspected again. Spray House Farm in Little Hayfield has 2,000 sheep, which roam on around 2,600 acres of hill with the potential to wander on a further 20,000 acres. A spokesman for the Peak District national park authority said it was still planned to reopen trails within the park. A final decision will be made today by Derbyshire county council.

But another panel member, the French co-discoverer of the HIV virus, Luc Montagnier, has urged the South African government to be pragmatic about treating Aids rather than engaging in academic arguments about its cause. A year ago, Mr Mbeki wrote to Bill Clinton, then US president, comparing critics of the Aids dissidents to the tyranny of the Spanish Inquisition and apartheid. But some scientists were so outraged by Mr Mbeki's stance that 5,000 of them signed a declaration before last year's international Aids conference in Durban stating categorically that Aids was the direct result of HIV.

Dr Tshabalala-Msimang said that while the division among panellists on the cause of Aids was fundamental, there was more agreement than before on the importance of factors such as poverty, literacy and sexism in the spread of HIV and Aids.

      "body": "<p>Since Tony Blair and George Bush met at Camp David more than a month ago to discover they shared so much in common - Colgate - they have not spoken again. Both men are undoubtedly busy. Mr Bush has had his spy plane shot down in China and Mr Blair has had his election plans shot down in the killing fields of northern Cumbria.</p> <p>It speaks volumes for the new transatlantic froideur that the two leaders have not been in contact. Nevertheless, the view in Whitehall is that George W is no dupe. Downing Street may privately sniff at some of his public performances, but in private, the word is that he is well briefed, intelligent and formidable. Comparisons with the cue-card reading Ronald Reagan do not wash. They believe they are facing a genuine rightwing ideologue. All the more reason to take seriously the president's decision to tear up the Kyoto agreement on climate change.</p> <p>The announcement is causing shock waves not just in the environmental movement, but throughout the capitals of Europe.</p> <p>But as one cabinet minister frankly admits: \"The Republican administration may trust us, but in terms of leverage - whether it is Star Wars or Kyoto - the plain fact is that the United States are going to do whatever they want to do.\"</p> <p>The rejection of the Kyoto Protocol by Washington has left Europe struggling to adopt a coherent response. At best the Europeans can only hope to hold the line and hope no one else peels off. At Prime Minister's Questions, Tony Blair stood by the Kyoto agreement and predicted there will be intensive talks in the run-up to the next round of talks in July. Mr Blair, in the second of his two recent speeches on the environment, described Kyoto as a \"monument to enlightened global diplomacy.\"</p> <p>In the short term, the aim must be to go on showing that good environmentalism and good economics need not be in conflict.</p> <p>An announcement today by the Department of Trade and Industry will start to show that Mr Blair is serious about meeting its ambitious target of ensuring that by 2010, at least 10% of future energy needs will be met from renewables.</p> <p>Mr Blair went on to offer an extra \u00a3100m to support renewables technology, in addition to the cash already provided. At present 2.8% of electricity comes from renewables.</p> <p>A lords select committee published a report in July 1999 warning that it was \"inconceivable that UK targets for electricity from renewables can be met without much fuller development on onshore and particularly offshore wind energy\".</p> <p>To meet the 10% target, the lords said that wind power \"in each year of the next decade needs to grow at about five times the best annual rate achieved in recent years'.'</p> <p>Yet the development of offshore wind has been ridiculously slow and bedevilled by planning permission problems. Developers need to make up to seven different approaches to gain consent. The law of the sea is opaque and despite the willingness of the Crown Estates, and Prince Charles, to cooperate, the process has been frustrating and slow.</p> <p>Consent has been needed under the Electricity Act 1989, the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985, the Coast and Protection Act 1949, the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, the Electricity Act 1989, the Water Resources Act 1991 and Transport and Works Act 1992. In addition, a lease is required from the Crown Estates commissioners for any project inside British territorial waters.</p> <p>Faced by this unsurpassed example of un-joined up government, it is not altogether surprising that the first offshore wind farm at Blyth harbour, in Northumberland, took nearly six years from conception to opening in December 2000. It has precisely two turbines.</p> <p>Following much inter- departmental wrangling, the new energy minister, Peter Hain, finally announced plans for a one-stop shop based in the DTI. Permission, as a consequence, may take as little as a year.</p> <p>Today progress will move to an altogether different dimension. Mr Hain, in conjunction with the Crown Estates, will announce 18 coastal sites for which planning permission can now be sought. Each site will have as many as 30 turbines, generating 90mw - or, together, the equivalent of 1% of total electricity supply. It is expected that more than 1m households will be able to receive their full energy needs from these wind farms.</p> <p>Greenpeace, not known for fawning, is preparing to welcome the announcement as a \"huge, huge improvement\". The British Wind Energy Association reckons it is a huge step for just one announcement. Britain will move from bottom of the league in wind power generation to near the top, or close to a par with Denmark.</p> <p>The sites to be leased include the Bristol Channel, the Solway Firth, Teesside, Humberside, Skegness, and the Kentish Flats.</p> <p>The projects will attract government funding, as generating costs are higher than for nuclear or fossil fuels.

      "bodyText": "Since Tony Blair and George Bush met at Camp David more than a month ago to discover they shared so much in common - Colgate - they have not spoken again. Both men are undoubtedly busy. Mr Bush has had his spy plane shot down in China and Mr Blair has had his election plans shot down in the killing fields of northern Cumbria. It speaks volumes for the new transatlantic froideur that the two leaders have not been in contact. Nevertheless, the view in Whitehall is that George W is no dupe. Downing Street may privately sniff at some of his public performances, but in private, the word is that he is well briefed, intelligent and formidable. Comparisons with the cue-card reading Ronald Reagan do not wash. They believe they are facing a genuine rightwing ideologue. All the more reason to take seriously the president's decision to tear up the Kyoto agreement on climate change. The announcement is causing shock waves not just in the environmental movement, but throughout the capitals of Europe. But as one cabinet minister frankly admits: \"The Republican administration may trust us, but in terms of leverage - whether it is Star Wars or Kyoto - the plain fact is that the United States are going to do whatever they want to do.\" The rejection of the Kyoto Protocol by Washington has left Europe struggling to adopt a coherent response. At best the Europeans can only hope to hold the line and hope no one else peels off. At Prime Minister's Questions, Tony Blair stood by the Kyoto agreement and predicted there will be intensive talks in the run-up to the next round of talks in July. Mr Blair, in the second of his two recent speeches on the environment, described Kyoto as a \"monument to enlightened global diplomacy.\" In the short term, the aim must be to go on showing that good environmentalism and good economics need not be in conflict. An announcement today by the Department of Trade and Industry will start to show that Mr Blair is serious about meeting its ambitious target of ensuring that by 2010, at least 10% of future energy needs will be met from renewables. Mr Blair went on to offer an extra \u00a3100m to support renewables technology, in addition to the cash already provided. At present 2.8% of electricity comes from renewables. A lords select committee published a report in July 1999 warning that it was \"inconceivable that UK targets for electricity from renewables can be met without much fuller development on onshore and particularly offshore wind energy\". To meet the 10% target, the lords said that wind power \"in each year of the next decade needs to grow at about five times the best annual rate achieved in recent years'.' Yet the development of offshore wind has been ridiculously slow and bedevilled by planning permission problems. Developers need to make up to seven different approaches to gain consent. The law of the sea is opaque and despite the willingness of the Crown Estates, and Prince Charles, to cooperate, the process has been frustrating and slow. Consent has been needed under the Electricity Act 1989, the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985, the Coast and Protection Act 1949, the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, the Electricity Act 1989, the Water Resources Act 1991 and Transport and Works Act 1992. In addition, a lease is required from the Crown Estates commissioners for any project inside British territorial waters. Faced by this unsurpassed example of un-joined up government, it is not altogether surprising that the first offshore wind farm at Blyth harbour, in Northumberland, took nearly six years from conception to opening in December 2000. It has precisely two turbines. Following much inter- departmental wrangling, the new energy minister, Peter Hain, finally announced plans for a one-stop shop based in the DTI. Permission, as a consequence, may take as little as a year. Today progress will move to an altogether different dimension. Mr Hain, in conjunction with the Crown Estates, will announce 18 coastal sites for which planning permission can now be sought. Each site will have as many as 30 turbines, generating 90mw - or, together, the equivalent of 1% of total electricity supply. It is expected that more than 1m households will be able to receive their full energy needs from these wind farms. Greenpeace, not known for fawning, is preparing to welcome the announcement as a \"huge, huge improvement\". The British Wind Energy Association reckons it is a huge step for just one announcement. Britain will move from bottom of the league in wind power generation to near the top, or close to a par with Denmark. The sites to be leased include the Bristol Channel, the Solway Firth, Teesside, Humberside, Skegness, and the Kentish Flats. The projects will attract government funding, as generating costs are higher than for nuclear or fossil fuels. But Mr Hain believes Britain, with its engineering skills generated from the North Sea oil industry, is uniquely well-placed. The industry will also benefit from the \u00a3100m aid for renewable energy announced by Tony Blair last year. Although coastal sites will clearly not attract the same level of planning opposition, as on shore sites, they may yet be controversial. Nimbyism does not stop at new housing estates, or animal burial sites. Blyth, for instance, is a couple of miles offshore and visible from the coastline on a clear day. Many of these sites will be near coastal resorts. If this all comes off, it might even make oil men like George Bush sit up and take notice.

This week however, rumours became reality as it emerged that spy software is the latest weapon in the entertainment industry's war against copyright pirates. But as file trading peer to peer networks like Napster and its successors become increasingly popular, can corporations force millions of people to obey laws they don't believe in? </p> <p>News site <a href=\"http://www.7amnews.com\" target=\"_new\">7amnews.com</a> has exposed a piece of software called Media Tracker, which it alleges the entertainment industry is using to spy on individuals using P2P networks. Media Tracker can tell exactly what pirated music, video or software files you are trading. It can trace your identity back through the network of servers and internet service providers (ISPs) you use when you access the web, and it can root out your computer's unique IP number. Lawyers can then use this to trace your identity, and send out a cautionary letter to your ISP insisting that you stop sharing copyrighted material, or potentially face prosecution. </p> <p>Industry lawyers have contacted ISPs over a hundred times in the past few weeks asking them to exclude individuals involved in file trading. By tracking over one million Roy Orbison songs being traded on Napster, lawyers were able to deduce the offenders' ISPs, demand from them names of the 60,000 individuals involved, and then force Napster to block their access. Similar legal action by the thrash metal band Metallica also led to users being barred from Napster. </p> <p>But these are small victo ries given the many millions of users in dozens of countries all disobeying copyright through P2P networks every day. Effectively engaged in a mass act of uncoordinated civil disobedience, people power looks set to overwhelm legal muscle and technical espionage. </p> <p>Unable to prosecute every user, the entertainment industry's options are already looking limited. Perhaps by making examples of a few high profile users they might intimidate others into stopping, but attacking your own customers is hardly good business. When Metallica took legal action against Napster - and effectively its own fans - they turned themselves into a joke, destroyed their rebellious image overnight and alienated the very people buying their albums. \"It was a disaster,\" said an EMI new media spokesman. \"The same teenagers who had Metallica posters on their walls were parodying the band on websites all over the internet, and re-doubling their efforts to copy and circulate the group's music\". </p> <p>In addition, the long-term success of any surveillance campaign would depend on the co-operation of ISPs, which are unlikely to want take on the time-consuming, and incredibly unpopular burden of becoming a global internet police force. </p> <p>If ISPs start accepting responsibility for what is held on subscribers' hard drives, it will not only dramatically increase their responsibilities, but also severely compromise the privacy of their customers, who will simply leave and join another less discriminating ISP. Any attempt to force ISPs to comply would pit the entertainment industry in a legal battle against very wealthy and powerful companies. </p> <p>Even if the entertainment industry lawyers overcome these obstacles, and manage to find a practical way of using the technology, it may already be out of date and unable to cope with the most recent P2P innovations. New file trading networks such as Freenet <a href=\"http://freenet.sourceforge.net\" target=\"_new\">http://freenet.sourceforge.net</a> are totally decentralised and spread files across all the computers involved. There is no central hub or index, and no way for individual users to tell what is being stored on their computers. No one keeps track of users, and this makes it nearly impossible for even sophisticated programs to track who is sharing what with whom. Even if other networks become unsafe, pirates could escape the prying eyes of entertainment industry lawyers by moving on to Freenet. </p> <p>Unless internet users decide to stop voluntarily, there seems very little the entertainment industry can do to force them. In a bizarre millennial twist on people power, popular greed has succeeded where socialism failed and capitalism is about to take a knock from the largest display of selfish solidarity the world has ever seen.</p>",

Unable to prosecute every user, the entertainment industry's options are already looking limited. Perhaps by making examples of a few high profile users they might intimidate others into stopping, but attacking your own customers is hardly good business. When Metallica took legal action against Napster - and effectively its own fans - they turned themselves into a joke, destroyed their rebellious image overnight and alienated the very people buying their albums. \"It was a disaster,\" said an EMI new media spokesman. \"The same teenagers who had Metallica posters on their walls were parodying the band on websites all over the internet, and re-doubling their efforts to copy and circulate the group's music\". In addition, the long-term success of any surveillance campaign would depend on the co-operation of ISPs, which are unlikely to want take on the time-consuming, and incredibly unpopular burden of becoming a global internet police force. If ISPs start accepting responsibility for what is held on subscribers' hard drives, it will not only dramatically increase their responsibilities, but also severely compromise the privacy of their customers, who will simply leave and join another less discriminating ISP. Any attempt to force ISPs to comply would pit the entertainment industry in a legal battle against very wealthy and powerful companies. Even if the entertainment industry lawyers overcome these obstacles, and manage to find a practical way of using the technology, it may already be out of date and unable to cope with the most recent P2P innovations. New file trading networks such as Freenet http://freenet.sourceforge.net are totally decentralised and spread files across all the computers involved. There is no central hub or index, and no way for individual users to tell what is being stored on their computers. No one keeps track of users, and this makes it nearly impossible for even sophisticated programs to track who is sharing what with whom. Even if other networks become unsafe, pirates could escape the prying eyes of entertainment industry lawyers by moving on to Freenet. Unless internet users decide to stop voluntarily, there seems very little the entertainment industry can do to force them. In a bizarre millennial twist on people power, popular greed has succeeded where socialism failed and capitalism is about to take a knock from the largest display of selfish solidarity the world has ever seen.",

It was up and running the following day and it stayed up for the rest of the show, but by then the obituaries had already been written.

      "body": "<p>When was the last time you sent yourself shopping on the internet? It sounds bizarre but this new concept is set to become a reality this week when a free service will be launched allowing web surfers to clone their own heads. </p> <p>New internet start up Digimask, backed by the media-owning brothers, Sir David and Sir Frederick Barclay, is providing technology so consumers can create colour 3D animated models of their heads in a matter of minutes. Consumers are being encouraged to email their heads to friends and use them to try on products when shopping at web-based stores. </p> <p>Sitting in his sleek office in Richmond, surrounded by advertising posters that proclaim that \"faceless e-commerce is dead\", Digimask's business development director Tony Pearce says the innovative service will help bring internet shopping back to life. \"We believe we are the missing link in e-commerce. The one missing link is you. Now you can take yourself into websites.\" He adds that people will also be able to take their virtual head into chat rooms, mobile phones and video games. </p> <p>So how does Digimask work? All that is required are two photos of yourself, one from the front and one from the side, transferred to your PC either by using a digital camera or by using a scanner if they are traditional photos. You go to <a href=\"http://www.digimask.com\">Digimask's website</a> and load them into a program called the launchpad, fill in a few questions about your height and weight and then email them off. Digimask sends you back a 3D model of your head in about 10 minutes. It is the equivalent of being cloned online. </p> <p>Retrieving and watching your own disembodied head floating on your computer screen is a fascinating and eerie experience. The heads speak too but not with your own voice and the conversation has been limited for this application. Mine greeted me with an American accent. \"Hi, I'm a Digimask,\" it said. \"Welcome to the future.\" </p> <p>So are virtual heads the future for e-commerce and do they actually herald a new phase in interactive entertainment? Sony appears to think so and has already signed up Digimask technology for PlayStation games including a wrestling title which is scheduled for release later this year. Gamers using web-enabled consoles will be able to dial up Digimask's database to transfer their own virtual faces on to one of the main wrestlers to personalise the matches. </p> <p>The company has also signed up an optician so you can try on a pair of specs on your virtual head, and a woman's portal is licensing the software so shoppers can give themselves a virtual makeover before buying any make up products. As the business develops, Pearce says they are planning to target clothes retailers, wig-makers, online jewellers and job search sites, so you can theoretically send your face on your CV to potential employers. </p> <p>Once created, a copy of the virtual head is stored on a database hosted by Intel. Each user is given an individual PIN number to use when collecting it. \"You can upload your head onto a website that has licensed our technology and try on their products,\" Pearce explains. She adds that it is difficult to create a head of someone else without them knowing because you need to provide two precisely different photos. </p> <p>The software that creates the heads is based on Microsoft e-business technologies. It has been developed for Digimask by Aris, a software systems development company with offices here and in the United States. </p> <p>When I visited the company they were still beta-testing and I was given expert help when I created my own virtual head. So it remains to be seen how people will cope on their own and whether it will deliver results quickly and reliably when it goes live. To accompany its launch this week, Digimask is unveiling a major advertising campaign. Large heads will be appearing on posters and a close look shows the eyes have been slightly altered. In one the iris is square-shaped. </p> <p>This cutting edge technology cannot accurately reproduce your hair style (hair is traditionally extremely difficult to copy) so you have to choose a virtual wig instead and long hair must be tied back as the Digimask system needs to see your ears to create a model. My virtual head looked a tad alien-like but was immediately recognisable. You also get a brand new set of shiny virtual teeth which I didn't mind. But I was not too happy about being given a Disney-esque American accent for the initial greeting. But at least it is over with quickly. </p> <p>Pearce explains that the ability to talk has been restricted to users of the free consumer service. But the company has linked up with US-based technology company LIPSinc which will enable Digimask to create talking heads capable of longer speeches, so potentially they can act as online customer service reps. </p> <p>The company is also hoping to take online dating to a new level. Linking up with software publisher SCi, it is shortly to launch a mobile dating service, which will let lonelyhearts send their faces to one another over Wap and next generation 3G phones. There will also be a private area on the website to meet, and exchange virtual faces. </p> <p>Virtual creation of people is quickly becoming a highly-specialised and competitive technology market. Biovirtual, another small start-up based in Didsbury in Cheshire, was recently commissioned to create animated representations of Anne Robinson to promote BBC2's Comedy Nights. Working from standard photographs, the company has created striking 3D talking models of the sharp-tongued presenter dressed, among other things, as a punk. </p> <p>\"It's quite a strange pursuit,\" admits Mike Sherwood, creative director of Biovirtual, as he extends Anne Robinson's nose on his computer screen. The process involves creatively aligning 3D structures to 2D images. \"You feel like a theatre direc tor working with an actor. You're trying to create the right emotional gestures.\" </p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.biovirtual.com\">Biovirtual</a> is already working with the police generating 3D models based on artist representations of eye-witness reports. At one stage, the company also considered working in the plastic surgery market to see if it could, for example, create accurate 3D models of breast implants based on photographs. But the idea was scrapped as surgery does not deliver such precise results, Sherwood explains. \"Even if a plastic surgeon has a hand as steady as a rock, you cannot predict exactly how the body will heal and react.\" </p> <p>Whatever the future holds for this innovative emerging technology industry, no one can dispute the scale of their ambitions. </p> <p>Pearce predicts that the next step in early 2002 will be fully animated virtual bodies so surfers can, for example, go to sites and try on wedding dresses or participate in interactive TV soaps alongside their favourite characters. </p> <p>Whether or not you do decide to go ahead and clone your head this week, it is probably wise to keep an eye out for strange objects arriving in your in-box.</p>",

Retrieving and watching your own disembodied head floating on your computer screen is a fascinating and eerie experience. The heads speak too but not with your own voice and the conversation has been limited for this application. Mine greeted me with an American accent. \"Hi, I'm a Digimask,\" it said. \"Welcome to the future.\" So are virtual heads the future for e-commerce and do they actually herald a new phase in interactive entertainment? Sony appears to think so and has already signed up Digimask technology for PlayStation games including a wrestling title which is scheduled for release later this year. Gamers using web-enabled consoles will be able to dial up Digimask's database to transfer their own virtual faces on to one of the main wrestlers to personalise the matches. The company has also signed up an optician so you can try on a pair of specs on your virtual head, and a woman's portal is licensing the software so shoppers can give themselves a virtual makeover before buying any make up products. As the business develops, Pearce says they are planning to target clothes retailers, wig-makers, online jewellers and job search sites, so you can theoretically send your face on your CV to potential employers. Once created, a copy of the virtual head is stored on a database hosted by Intel. Each user is given an individual PIN number to use when collecting it. \"You can upload your head onto a website that has licensed our technology and try on their products,\" Pearce explains. She adds that it is difficult to create a head of someone else without them knowing because you need to provide two precisely different photos. The software that creates the heads is based on Microsoft e-business technologies. It has been developed for Digimask by Aris, a software systems development company with offices here and in the United States. When I visited the company they were still beta-testing and I was given expert help when I created my own virtual head. So it remains to be seen how people will cope on their own and whether it will deliver results quickly and reliably when it goes live. To accompany its launch this week, Digimask is unveiling a major advertising campaign. Large heads will be appearing on posters and a close look shows the eyes have been slightly altered. In one the iris is square-shaped. This cutting edge technology cannot accurately reproduce your hair style (hair is traditionally extremely difficult to copy) so you have to choose a virtual wig instead and long hair must be tied back as the Digimask system needs to see your ears to create a model. My virtual head looked a tad alien-like but was immediately recognisable. You also get a brand new set of shiny virtual teeth which I didn't mind. But I was not too happy about being given a Disney-esque American accent for the initial greeting. But at least it is over with quickly. Pearce explains that the ability to talk has been restricted to users of the free consumer service. But the company has linked up with US-based technology company LIPSinc which will enable Digimask to create talking heads capable of longer speeches, so potentially they can act as online customer service reps. The company is also hoping to take online dating to a new level. Linking up with software publisher SCi, it is shortly to launch a mobile dating service, which will let lonelyhearts send their faces to one another over Wap and next generation 3G phones. There will also be a private area on the website to meet, and exchange virtual faces. Virtual creation of people is quickly becoming a highly-specialised and competitive technology market. Biovirtual, another small start-up based in Didsbury in Cheshire, was recently commissioned to create animated representations of Anne Robinson to promote BBC2's Comedy Nights. Working from standard photographs, the company has created striking 3D talking models of the sharp-tongued presenter dressed, among other things, as a punk. \"It's quite a strange pursuit,\" admits Mike Sherwood, creative director of Biovirtual, as he extends Anne Robinson's nose on his computer screen. The process involves creatively aligning 3D structures to 2D images. \"You feel like a theatre direc tor working with an actor. You're trying to create the right emotional gestures.\" Biovirtual is already working with the police generating 3D models based on artist representations of eye-witness reports. At one stage, the company also considered working in the plastic surgery market to see if it could, for example, create accurate 3D models of breast implants based on photographs. But the idea was scrapped as surgery does not deliver such precise results, Sherwood explains. \"Even if a plastic surgeon has a hand as steady as a rock, you cannot predict exactly how the body will heal and react.\" Whatever the future holds for this innovative emerging technology industry, no one can dispute the scale of their ambitions. Pearce predicts that the next step in early 2002 will be fully animated virtual bodies so surfers can, for example, go to sites and try on wedding dresses or participate in interactive TV soaps alongside their favourite characters. Whether or not you do decide to go ahead and clone your head this week, it is probably wise to keep an eye out for strange objects arriving in your in-box.",

It anticipates that by 2005 it will be able to squeeze an average of \u00a3400 a viewer a year through each set top box.

Well, you cannot access news groups, or upload content to the net through the set top box. Also, a PC screen has many more pixels per inch than a television and the images are much better defined.

At best you have to open up your web page authoring program and amend your pages there, before uploading them to your ISP. At worst you have to delve into the raw HTML code that makes up the page, and change it all by hand. You might get better with practice, but it is still a deterrent. </p> <p>One solution to this problem is the weblog, or \"blog\". A blog is a fairly simple web page which has short, diary-like entries added in at the top. This is fast to produce, makes it clear when you have updated the page, and keeps the older material below so infrequent visitors can catch up. </p> <p>Blogs are now hugely popular, for all sorts of subjects. Some review other websites, while others exist as a centrepoint to an online community of interest. Others are used to keep colleagues in touch with each other, or manage projects. There are also a huge number that contain vaguely confessional musings - a new web style which for many has come to define what a blog is. A good example of this form is the Daily Brad at <a href=\"http://www.bradlands.com/dailybrad\">www.bradlands.com/dailybrad</a>.</p> <p> Blogs are, in short, hugely versatile. And, to make things even easier, there is a web service that makes setting up your own blog a 10-minute process. The blog can then be incorporated in your own website, or posted on a special server. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.blogger.com\">Blogger</a> is the service used to create the Daily Brad and thousands of other blogs across the net. These are the 10 simple steps to setting up your own. </p> <p> <strong> 1 Register with the site.</strong> <br> Happily, Blogger does not demand too much information. Go to <a href=\"http://www.blogger.com\">www.blogger.com</a> and fill in the Sign Up! box in the bottom right hand corner of the screen. You'll arrive at another screen that asks for your name and email address. After you complete that screen, you'll be returned to the front page. </p> <p> <strong> 2 Click on Create a Blog</strong> <br> You will then be asked to name your page, and provide a description. You will be able to amend these later, if you want. You will also be given the option to advertise your blog in public, although if you choose \"no\" it will not be completely secure - just unadvertised. </p> <p> <strong> 3 Choose a location for your blog</strong> <br> Blogger.com then asks if you want to have your blog put in its own home at the free, but advertising-supported, Blogspot.com. This is the easiest option for beginners; you can always move it later if you want. If you choose this option, you will be asked to choose a \"subdomain\" for your website - this will form the unique part of the web address of your blog (See <a href=\"http://www.yoursite.blogspot.com\">www.yoursite.blogspot.com</a>) You might find popular words are already used, so this might take a few attempts. When you have chosen an acceptable name, you arrive at the template screen. Move straight to step 4. </p> <p>The alternative for the more experienced web master is to have the blog incorporated in your own site. If you already have a website and know how it was set up, this is the neatest option. You will need to tell Blogger.com the FTP address of your site, the file path for the blogger page, as well as the file name and eventual URL of that page. You will need to enter further server details on the settings screen, off the editing screen (see panel). </p> <p>Note that Blogger will not be able to upload its pages to your webspace if you use a webspace provider which only allows you to update your pages when connected to their dial-up service. Possibly for this reason, Blogger is known not to work with AOL's free web space. </p> <p>The simplest workaround, apart from getting new webspace that allows FTP access from anywhere, is to use Blogger's own servers to host your blog, and create a link to the blog from your site. </p> <p>More HTML-savvy readers could, alternatively, create a framed page on their site which calls up the blog page held on Blogger's servers. </p> <p> <strong> 4 Choose a template for your blog</strong> <br> Pick a basic layout for your page from four options. Click on Finish! </p> <p> <strong> 5 The Blogger editing screen</strong> <br> You now arrive at the page from which most of the work is done for your blog. In the top half of the screen is the input window, where you type what you want to appear on your page. In the bottom half of the screen is a preview window, which shows what your entries will look like when published. </p> <p> <strong> 6 Type your first entries</strong> <br> To get your blog started, type your first entry in to the editing window. See the panel on this page for an explanation of the various buttons on this screen. </p> <p> <strong> 7 Creating web links and headlines</strong> <br> It is possible to add HTML tags to your entries, which can do things like create links to other web pages and create larger text for headlines. For instance, to get larger text simply type \"This is a headline \". To create a link, type: \"Here is a link to my website \". The word \"website\" will be a clickable link. </p> <p> <strong> 8 Preview entry</strong> <br> Click on the post button to see how your new entry will look. </p> <p> <strong> 9 Amending entries</strong> <br> Click on the [edit] link at the end of the entry you want to change. </p> <p> <strong> 10 Finished entry</strong> <br> When you are happy with your first weblog, click on the Post and Publish button. Your weblog will be available for the world to see! </p> <p>This, of course, is only the beginning. The beauty of Blogger is that it starts out easy, but allows you to get as complicated as you like. You can change the templates to create a more sophisticated look, for instance. Blogger has a useful help section - just click on the help button in the editing window. </p> <p> <strong> Buttons</strong> </p> <p> The editing window has several important buttons </p> <p><strong> Posts</strong> brings up the main editing screen </p> <p><strong> Settings</strong> allows you to change the important information for your site, like where it is to be published. You can also enter and amend server details, including the username and password, if you are FTPing your pages. </p> <p><strong> Template</strong> allows users more expert in HTML to customise their own blog templates. </p> <p><strong> Archive</strong> allows you to archive, or republish, parts of your blog. </p> <p><strong> Team </strong> allows you to set who has access to edit your blog - useful if you want several people to be able to post to the blog. </p> <p><strong> My blogs</strong> allows you to switch between blogs, if you have several. </p> <p><strong> Post</strong> takes the words you have typed in to the top box on the editing screen and puts them in the preview pane below, showing you how it would look when published. </p> <p><strong> Post and Publish </strong> both updates the Preview pane, and uploads your new words to the blog that can be seen by passing readers. </p>",

This is the easiest option for beginners; you can always move it later if you want. If you choose this option, you will be asked to choose a \"subdomain\" for your website - this will form the unique part of the web address of your blog (See www.yoursite.blogspot.com) You might find popular words are already used, so this might take a few attempts. When you have chosen an acceptable name, you arrive at the template screen. Move straight to step 4. The alternative for the more experienced web master is to have the blog incorporated in your own site. If you already have a website and know how it was set up, this is the neatest option. You will need to tell Blogger.com the FTP address of your site, the file path for the blogger page, as well as the file name and eventual URL of that page. You will need to enter further server details on the settings screen, off the editing screen (see panel). Note that Blogger will not be able to upload its pages to your webspace if you use a webspace provider which only allows you to update your pages when connected to their dial-up service. Possibly for this reason, Blogger is known not to work with AOL's free web space. The simplest workaround, apart from getting new webspace that allows FTP access from anywhere, is to use Blogger's own servers to host your blog, and create a link to the blog from your site. More HTML-savvy readers could, alternatively, create a framed page on their site which calls up the blog page held on Blogger's servers. 4 Choose a template for your blog Pick a basic layout for your page from four options. Click on Finish! 5 The Blogger editing screen You now arrive at the page from which most of the work is done for your blog. In the top half of the screen is the input window, where you type what you want to appear on your page. In the bottom half of the screen is a preview window, which shows what your entries will look like when published. 6 Type your first entries To get your blog started, type your first entry in to the editing window. See the panel on this page for an explanation of the various buttons on this screen. 7 Creating web links and headlines It is possible to add HTML tags to your entries, which can do things like create links to other web pages and create larger text for headlines. For instance, to get larger text simply type \"This is a headline \". To create a link, type: \"Here is a link to my website \". The word \"website\" will be a clickable link. 8 Preview entry Click on the post button to see how your new entry will look. 9 Amending entries Click on the [edit] link at the end of the entry you want to change. 10 Finished entry When you are happy with your first weblog, click on the Post and Publish button. Your weblog will be available for the world to see! This, of course, is only the beginning. The beauty of Blogger is that it starts out easy, but allows you to get as complicated as you like. You can change the templates to create a more sophisticated look, for instance. Blogger has a useful help section - just click on the help button in the editing window. Buttons The editing window has several important buttons Posts brings up the main editing screen Settings allows you to change the important information for your site, like where it is to be published. You can also enter and amend server details, including the username and password, if you are FTPing your pages. Template allows users more expert in HTML to customise their own blog templates. Archive allows you to archive, or republish, parts of your blog. Team allows you to set who has access to edit your blog - useful if you want several people to be able to post to the blog. My blogs allows you to switch between blogs, if you have several. Post takes the words you have typed in to the top box on the editing screen and puts them in the preview pane below, showing you how it would look when published. Post and Publish both updates the Preview pane, and uploads your new words to the blog that can be seen by passing readers.",

      "bodyText": "Having a biological father who maintained a close relationship with his son, whether or not he lived in the family home, might be crucial in preventing susceptible boys becoming criminals, research presented yesterday suggested. But stepfathers appeared to do little to decrease the risk that a boy will turn to crime, the conference of the British Psychological Society's division of forensic psychology heard in Birmingham. The study by the clinical psychologist Jenny Taylor looked at why a proportion of boys with all the \"risk factors\" associated with criminal behaviour resisted a life of crime. Drawing on data from socially deprived areas of south London, she compared a group of \"good boys\", who had no criminal convictions and had caused teachers no trouble, with a group of \"bad boys\" at a secure unit for unmanageable adolescents, many of them persisitent offenders convicted of sexual assault, theft and stealing vehicles. All 68 boys, aged between 12 and 16, were from working class backgrounds, had lower than average intellectual ability, had similar problems with their peers and with hyperactivity, had equally large families, and in both groups 40% suffered from dyslexia. But there was one \"very striking\" difference between the two groups: 55% of the \"good boys\" lived with their biological fathers, compared with only 4% of the \"bad boys\". Almost 80% of the \"good boys\" spoke of being close to their biological fathers. Among these were 24% of the group who said they had a biological father living away from home who was an influence in their lives. Only 18% said there was no one they regarded as a father figure, while 3% said they had a stepfather. Among the \"bad boys\", 45% said they had no one they considered a father figure, 30% said they had a stepfather, 22% a biological father not living at home and only 4% a father living at home. Such findings would appear to back research suggesting that having a stepfather was an additional \"risk factor\", said Dr Taylor, who carried out the research while at the South London and Maudsley NHS trust. It also suggested that a father who disapproved of crime and showed an interest in his son acted as a crucial social control, countering negative influences such as criminal peers. Boys gained a sense of being loved and approved of, and the fear of jeopardising this proved enough to deter them from crime, she said. \"For children in this age group, formal controls - such as being told off by police - aren't enough.\" Dr Taylor denied that her work suggested that \"at risk\" boys needed to live in a nuclear family. \"It's not necessarily about them living with their biological fathers but about having someone they think of as a father who shows an interest in them and what they're doing,\" she said. The research, far from providing fodder for the rightwing family values lobby, could be seen as a boon for single mothers, she said. \"This suggests we should move away from pathologising single mums and instead see that, if there are dangers, it's due to the absence of fathers.\" \u0095 When offenders don a disguise, such as a balaclava, hood or mask, it makes them more violent and destructive to people and property, a forensic psychologist, Andrew Silke, of the University of Leicester, told the conference. He believed this was less because they thought there would be no comeback than because, by becoming anonymous, they felt freed from the normal constraints. The findings emerged from comparing police, victim and media reports in his study of 500 paramilitary punishment beatings in Northern Ireland, 205 of which (41%) involved offenders wearing disguises.",

But the government is unlikely to provide any more assistance without a contribution from shareholders, and that still means a rescue rights issue. But, with the shares in freefall, at what price? Without it, as some analysts were pointing out yesterday, Railtrack could still be heading for the buffers and a Eurotunnel-style crisis.",

He's wearing a fleece with Team Stella emblazoned on it. A few minutes later a former director of the Tate Gallery pops in to say hello. Whatever Stella does now, even if he goes senile and starts exhibiting doodles, he will be remembered as a great American artist. He has known this since he was in his early 20s. </p> <p>Stella was born in 1936, grew up in a suburb of Boston, and was just out of Princeton when he produced his so-called Black Paintings. With such grimly evocative titles as Die Fahne Hoch! (The Banner High), named after a Nazi marching song, and The Marriage of Reason and Squalor, Stella's first paintings are shocking. Each consists of a layering of black rectangular stripes, fanning out like the citadels of some lost Assyrian city, taking their shape from the canvas itself. They have been interpreted as both an attack on the high modernist art of the abstract expressionist artists who came before him - Pollock, Rothko and Newman - and the continuation of their achievement. He has been acclaimed as both the founder of minimalism and the last artist to stand against it. </p> <p>Either way, Stella's debut was a sensation. His Black Paintings were shown at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1960 in an exhibition that also showcased Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg. But the 24-year old Stella stood out. The paintings were bought by the museum, and are now displayed alongside such masterpieces as Johns's Flag, Pollock's One and Matisse's Piano Lesson. </p> <p>Stella was a prodigy, a figure of exceptional glamour, the champ, characterised as a genius while still at Princeton. Genius is a big word, but before he left university, Stella was accustomed to people applying it to him and the praise in the 1960s only got more elevated. </p> <p>But what does a genius do next? </p> <p>Frank Stella is in London to promote a book, Frank Stella's Moby Dick by Robert K Wallace. It chronicles and analyses the series that Stella himself sees as central to his later career - artworks made during the 1980s and 1990s, including lithographs, sculptures and installations, each of which takes its title from one of the 135 chapters of Herman Melville's great American novel. \"Why couldn't there be a British Melville?\" wonders Stella. \"They had great explorers, but, I don't know, a quest for God or chasing the white whale is different from a quest for empire, right? The British want to really own it somehow; the Americans just want to be able to grasp it. Maybe they're slightly less materialistic - it's hard to believe.\" </p> <p>Indeed it is. But American art such as Stella's is less materialistic, pushing for abstraction while British art remains defiantly earthbound. Stella's spiritual apprehension of the visual world may be linked to his origins in puritan Boston (not that far from Nantucket from where the Pequod sets sail in Moby Dick). </p> <p>It occurs to you, seeing him behind that big desk and listening to his dryly humorous voice telling his tale, that Stella himself would make a character in a great American novel. He's a modern Queequeg - the supremely talented harpoonist in Moby Dick, who, when asked for his credentials, throws his harpoon at a tiny blob of tar on a roof, hitting the target dead centre. If that was a whale's eye, he says, the whale would be dead now. Stella once told his friend Michael Fried, the critic and art historian, that his own idea of genius was the baseball player Ted Williams, because he could see the ball perfectly and then hit it right out of the park. </p> <p>Stella became a revered American artist when he was in his early 20s, but he didn't rest on his laurels and he didn't make more and more brutal paintings. Instead he tried to stage that elusive second act. He began to make his paintings more complex in structure, colour and shape, and then brought them off the wall, welding, shaping, doing what a sculptor does, but still - in fact more recognisably than with the Black Paintings - seeing as a painter. </p> <p>Critics have been, to say the least, divided about what happened to the art of Frank Stella. Right now, art is in a swing back to the minimalist objective art of the 1960s; artists are acclaimed for their starkness, and Stella's early work looks modern in a way that his later work does not. Young artists are transfixed and influenced by Die Fahne Hoch! or Six Mile Bottom (1960), with its silvery authority, in a way they are not by 138 attractive but inessential works responding to Moby Dick. But then, as Stella says, when he started out, some critic described his stripe paintings as \"boring\". \"People say I jump around a lot, but it seems to me like I spend plenty of time on everything I work on. I can't say I left many stones unturned. But things do wear out for me.\" </p> <p>If Stella's career were a great American novel, the most important supporting character would be Fried. It's not just that they went to Princeton together and both became towering figures in the nation's cultural establishment (Fried has become one of America's most lauded academics) but that Fried's and Stella's ideas are intertwined. At one point, Stella criticises the art of his contemporary, the minimalist Donald Judd, as \"literalist\". It's one of Fried's favourite words. </p> <p>Fried loathed the minimalists - Donald Judd, Robert Morris, Carl Andre - artists who emerged in New York in the 1960s, wanting to do something different from the generation of Pollock and Rothko, and who simply presented \"objects\" to the viewer, brutally shorn of traditional aesthetic values. In a famous 1967 article in the New York magazine Artforum, Fried denounced minimalism as \"theatrical\" - claiming that it made cheap claims on people's attention - and \"literal\" - ie misunderstanding the nature of art as illusion. Modern art, he argued, was the opposite of this - a repudiation of theatre, false values, and the merely objective; ultimately, a spiritually uplifting art. It's a debate that still matters because minimalism is the underpinning of art today. All those vitrines and casts, the shark and the house. </p> <p>But what did Fried have to say about his friend Stella? For many, Stella's early paintings were the founding statements of minimalism. Fried argued, however, that as Stella developed, he was making it more and more plain that he was a painterly painter, who believed in art, and that his works, with their increasing richness, were deliberate corrections of the minimalist mistake. Yet, in his youth, Stella said some tough and undeniably minimalist things about art. He said that in his paintings, \"What you see is what you see\". He said, \"I tried to keep the paint as good as it was in the can.\" </p> <p>Today he says that he never wanted to destroy anyone's idea of a well-made painting. The Black Paintings are, \"quite painterly - although they're one colour, they seem to me to be closer to Rothko than just about anything else. The idea that these were such a rejection of abstract expressionism I don't think is accurate.\" Stella describes his Moby Dick series as a kind of tribute to those Captain Ahabs, the abstract expressionists. \"They're still the generation I admire. This is paying my debt, or not so much paying my debt as expressing my admiration for the abstract expressionist generation that I grew up with and that I admired the most, and that I still admire.\" </p> <p>Moby Dick, Ahab's doomed pursuit of the mystical image of the great white whale, was a touchstone for the abstract expressionist painters. Jackson Pollock named at least one painting after the novel and intended to give its name to his classic early work Pasiphae, then switched to something from Greek myth because his patron Peggy Guggenheim didn't like the Melville reference. Pollock's sense of space is absolutely suggested by Melville, and the rolling, wild wave forms of Stella's Moby Dick - inspired by observing beluga whales swimming in the New York aquarium - are very Pollock. </p> <p>In the Moby Dick series, Stella sees himself challenging the deepest assumptions of modern art with a new understanding of what abstraction can do: \"Abstraction in the 20th century is dependent on cubism, which is arranging planes in space, but the planes are arranged in a kind of stiff and geometric kind of way. Once the planes begin to bend and curve and deform then you get into what happens in Moby Dick - it's a way of opening things up for abstraction.\" </p> <p>Stella certainly has more in common with the American painters of Pollock's generation than he does with the ironising, theatrical minimalists who thought he was on their side. But he has ended up cast adrift in an open boat, an American individualist making his own eccentric way, as the watchers from the shore try and fail to categorise him - a minimalist, a modernist, a postmodernist. This makes the novel in which he is a character, the champ, the American genius, a troubling read. Frank Stella has never done anything that lived up to his early work. But who has? </p> <p>\u0095 Frank Stella's Moby Dick by Robert K Wallace is published by Michigan University Press, price \u00a342.50.</p>",

Fried loathed the minimalists - Donald Judd, Robert Morris, Carl Andre - artists who emerged in New York in the 1960s, wanting to do something different from the generation of Pollock and Rothko, and who simply presented \"objects\" to the viewer, brutally shorn of traditional aesthetic values. In a famous 1967 article in the New York magazine Artforum, Fried denounced minimalism as \"theatrical\" - claiming that it made cheap claims on people's attention - and \"literal\" - ie misunderstanding the nature of art as illusion. Modern art, he argued, was the opposite of this - a repudiation of theatre, false values, and the merely objective; ultimately, a spiritually uplifting art. It's a debate that still matters because minimalism is the underpinning of art today. All those vitrines and casts, the shark and the house. But what did Fried have to say about his friend Stella? For many, Stella's early paintings were the founding statements of minimalism. Fried argued, however, that as Stella developed, he was making it more and more plain that he was a painterly painter, who believed in art, and that his works, with their increasing richness, were deliberate corrections of the minimalist mistake. Yet, in his youth, Stella said some tough and undeniably minimalist things about art. He said that in his paintings, \"What you see is what you see\". He said, \"I tried to keep the paint as good as it was in the can.\" Today he says that he never wanted to destroy anyone's idea of a well-made painting. The Black Paintings are, \"quite painterly - although they're one colour, they seem to me to be closer to Rothko than just about anything else. The idea that these were such a rejection of abstract expressionism I don't think is accurate.\" Stella describes his Moby Dick series as a kind of tribute to those Captain Ahabs, the abstract expressionists. \"They're still the generation I admire. This is paying my debt, or not so much paying my debt as expressing my admiration for the abstract expressionist generation that I grew up with and that I admired the most, and that I still admire.\" Moby Dick, Ahab's doomed pursuit of the mystical image of the great white whale, was a touchstone for the abstract expressionist painters. Jackson Pollock named at least one painting after the novel and intended to give its name to his classic early work Pasiphae, then switched to something from Greek myth because his patron Peggy Guggenheim didn't like the Melville reference. Pollock's sense of space is absolutely suggested by Melville, and the rolling, wild wave forms of Stella's Moby Dick - inspired by observing beluga whales swimming in the New York aquarium - are very Pollock. In the Moby Dick series, Stella sees himself challenging the deepest assumptions of modern art with a new understanding of what abstraction can do: \"Abstraction in the 20th century is dependent on cubism, which is arranging planes in space, but the planes are arranged in a kind of stiff and geometric kind of way. Once the planes begin to bend and curve and deform then you get into what happens in Moby Dick - it's a way of opening things up for abstraction.\" Stella certainly has more in common with the American painters of Pollock's generation than he does with the ironising, theatrical minimalists who thought he was on their side. But he has ended up cast adrift in an open boat, an American individualist making his own eccentric way, as the watchers from the shore try and fail to categorise him - a minimalist, a modernist, a postmodernist. This makes the novel in which he is a character, the champ, the American genius, a troubling read. Frank Stella has never done anything that lived up to his early work. But who has? \u0095 Frank Stella's Moby Dick by Robert K Wallace is published by Michigan University Press, price \u00a342.50.",

In their iconic encapsulations of the burnished nirvana of southern California, the Beach Boys were dazzled by visions of girls driving around in T-birds having \"fun fun fun\".

The car represented freedom and mobility for the suddenly affluent postwar teen - the American postwar teen, at any rate. Before the invention of the pubescent dotcom billionaire, teenagers didn't own their own homes, so the car was the perfect parent-free venue for such necessary pastimes as \"necking\" or even \"going all the way\".

Where American youth might find itself tooling around in gas-guzzling Thunderbirds and Mustangs, its impoverished UK counterparts were probably trapped on British Rail's clattering rust-buckets or, at best, braving the elements on the back of a sputtering Lambretta scooter.

You could write a thesis on love and death in the American automobile, so intricately is the car entwined with the American psyche and America's economic growth, but we British have never quite managed to see it the same way. James Dean sealed his own legend by getting decapitated in a silver Porsche Spyder on a California highway, but by bathetic contrast Marc Bolan was killed when his badly maintained purple Mini drove into a tree on Barnes common. Jan &amp; Dean's cars-and-death classic Dead Man's Curve, complete with blasting horns and crash noises, gave the car a love-in-death aura Wagner himself would have admired, but it's a thoroughly un-British approach.

America was where Prince would sing about a Little Red Corvette, but in Blighty we had to put up with Tom Robinson telling us about his Ford Cortina. Bruce Springsteen's Born To Run used hurtling imagery of engines, wheel-rims and fuel-injection to concoct a kind of West Side Story with jacked-up suspension and go-faster stripes, whereas our own Gary Numan took the word \"cars\" and turned it into a suicidal dirge. </p> <p>Berry Gordy's Motown label was named after the throbbing hub of the American motor industry, and its streamlined approach in some ways echoed the industrial practices of the big car-makers.

For example, Don Henley's elegiac hit The Boys of Summer managed to nail the doubts of a generation with its line \"I saw a Dead Head sticker on a Cadillac\", a brilliant shorthand depiction of how the hippies gave up flower-power and went into advertising. When Neil Young wrote Long May You Run, it wasn't just a nostalgic ode to a favourite car, it was a coded depiction of the journey from innocence to experience, or perhaps from youth to manhood - \"we've been through some things together, with trunks of memories still to come.

According to testimony published yesterday by Le Monde, the former deputy-director of the city's public works department Fran\u00e7ois Ciolina told investigators: \"Certain businessmen told me openly that, in order to win contracts, it was necessary to deposit cash at the office of the mayor.\" Mr Ciolina said that Mr Chirac was the inspiration for the scam - alleged to have skimmed money off public building and maintenance contracts - and that the coffers of his Gaullist RPR party were the main beneficiary. His revelations came on the day that Mr Chirac was supposed to be questioned by the investigating magistrate, Eric Halphen. The president, who has immunity from prosecution as long as he is in office, refused last week to obey the summons, arguing that to do so would be \"contrary to the principle of the separation of powers and to the demands of the continuity of the state\". Mr Ciolina, who is himself under investigation for influence peddling in the ever-widening scandal, confirmed many of the accusations levelled against Mr Chirac by Jean-Claude M\u00e9ry, a former property developer and senior RPR fundraiser who died in 1999. In a confession recorded in 1996 but released late last year, Mr M\u00e9ry said the covert fundraising system was run \"exclusively on Mr Chirac's orders\", and brought the RPR some \u00a310m a year. According to Le Monde, Mr Ciolina confirmed that this sum was a \"credible\" amount.",

A heated meeting of club members yesterday finally overturned last month's decision to blackball the famous soprano and nine other women who had applied to join. That decision provoked outrage across Spain and in the international opera world. But yesterday's was a pyrrhic victory for the club's president, Joan Anton Maragall, and the rest of his board; they had to resign when their macho opponents took revenge by proposing a successful motion of no confidence. Mr Maragall's wife, Magda Ferrer, was one of those admitted to the club by yesterday's special assembly. The meeting also decided to end a application system, using black and white balls, whereby only a third of votes was needed to block candidates. An emergency committee has taken over the running of the 1,200-member club, which holds private recitals and hosts debates on opera, music and the arts. The news was greeted with delight by some of the women who were given approval for membership. \"At least I will not now have to ask my husband's permission every time I want to go in. This is a great victory for women,\" businesswoman Adela Subirana said. Ms Subirana, one of the wealthiest people in Barcelona, would previously have needed written permission from a male member before entering the rooms, decorated with modernist Catalan art, that the club occupies within the recently rebuilt opera house on the tree-lined Ramblas boulevard. \"This is one of the last outposts of die-hard conservatism,\" one outgoing board member said. The opponents of the reform accepted, if somewhat ungraciously, that women had now become Cercle members. \"I don't think that anyone will insult them when they get here,\" said Alberto Roca, an opposition leader who has joined the emergency committee. A new board is to be elected later this year. Women, in theory, will be allowed to stand.",

The Israeli foreign minister, Shimon Peres, is believed to have tabled a four-point plan during talks in Athens with his Palestinian counterpart, Nabil Sha'ath, and the chief Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat. As well as the Athens meeting, the Jordanian government hoped that a plan it was putting forward jointly with Egypt may prove successful, while three doveish Israeli MPs travelled to Ramallah on the West Bank to discuss options for reducing violence with the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat. An Israeli foreign ministry spokesman said there were reports that Mr Arafat was considering flying to Athens for talks with Mr Peres but he had no firm information about his intentions. Mr Peres, speaking after more than two hours of talks at an economic conference, said he hoped security officers from both sides would meet within 24 hours to discuss how to end the violence. US representatives are to be included in the security talks at the border between Israel and the Gaza Strip. Mr Peres said: \"This is the first sign that there is truly an intention to stop the terror and begin to talk.\" He added: \"We shall continue to talk. Better talking than shooting.\" But Mr Erekat warned against raising expectations. \"We have different points of views in the way we see things on the ground.\" Behind the scenes, there was near-total pessimism on both sides about the prospects of finding a peace formula. Israeli officials stressed that there was no contradiction between Mr Sharon's refusal to negotiate until the violence has ended and Mr Peres's meeting in Athens. \"This was an exchange of views, not negotiation,\" a spokesman for Mr Peres said.

Despite military and financial support from Russia, Iran, India and Tajikistan, Cmdr Masood's forces have struggled to regain large areas of land, including their political headquarters at Taloqan, lost to the Taliban last summer. He has since agreed fragile military alliances with rival commanders, many of whom have betrayed him in past battles, and promised to mount a new offensive in the coming weeks as the winter snows melt. Cmdr Masood said he was willing to accept European aid in any form, whether political, military or humanitarian. \"We face major human problems in health, education and with refugees,\" he said. \"I have to signal with regret that the aid provided in the past has been minimal and insignificant. Due to the lack of food in the north, lives have been lost.\" A French foreign ministry spokesman said Mr V\u00e9drine had promised a package of humanitarian aid measures for the Afghan people suffering from a drought that has brought famine to several areas of the country.",

The official reason is to improve competitiveness. We all know that Switzerland is a cheap place to do business. But future generations won't know what they're missing! Poor little blighters. So how will we get our kids to fall asleep? Don't worry, supplies will be imported from the Swiss factory. Anyway, it's now being marketed as energy-giving rather than yawn-inducing. Get away! 25,000 cups were served to athletes in the 1948 Olympics actually. And Sir Edmund Hillary used it on his successful ascent of Everest in 1953. Has anyone touched the stuff since then? More than 10m jars are apparently sold in the UK each year. Some people must be guzzling it. Enough to sing about? Ad campaigns have been memorable. The \"We're the Ovaltineys\" jingle made the top 20 in 1980. Who was that by? The Ovaltineys, a bunch of child stars who promoted its nutritional benefits. They even had their own show on Radio Luxembourg. Is it really good for you? Novartis, who make it, reckon you can virtually live off its nutrients. After all, Great Britain was brought up on it, so it must work. All that history lost. Jobs as well? The plant in Kings Langley, Hertfordshire, will close, with the loss of 245 jobs. Most likely to say: \"Because we all drink Ovaltine, we're happy boys and girls.\" Not to be confused with: Horlicks.",

Yet there they were, all wrinkles, recollections and rheumy eyes in <strong> Through The Eyes Of The Old</strong> (BBC1). And blimey, what absorbing, moving viewing they made. </p> <p>That shouldn't come as a surprise. Why wouldn't a collection of older people reflecting upon the past and ruminating on the present be engrossing television? Isn't it obvious that those with the most life experience have an awful lot to say about life? There is a reason for that phrase \"older and wiser\", isn't there? And even if there wasn't, they are - like teenagers, say - people with stories to tell. </p> <p>But unlike other people's, old folks' stories get lost. Not in an accidental, down-the-back-of-the-sofa kind of way. More in a sack-of-kittens-in-the-canal kind of way. For if we're honest, most of us young 'uns don't like old people. Even the phrase \"old people\" sounds like an insult. The scorn that taints those words has meant the evolution of supposedly nicer sounding alternatives like \"senior citizens\", \"pensioners\" and \"the elderly\", but these still sound opprobrious because any description of those in the autumn of their lives is unavoidably contaminated with contempt. We could describe everyone over 70 as \"wonderful human beings\" and it would still sound like a slur. Any stories these wonderful human beings have to tell, goes the logic, aren't really worth listening to. </p> <p>(The logic, naturally, is flawed but we follow it nonetheless. Just as when a grandparent dies - or worse, goes loopy and forgets pretty much everything about everything - and you yearn to have the time back so you could ask them all about their lives, so Through The Eyes Of The Old was riven with sadness. You want to be able to fill in the gaps between the fragments of stories they told you as you were growing up, stories you weren't really listening to because you were too preoccupied with how to get them to buy you candy floss or American Cream Soda. This you learn as you get older. And when it's too late.) </p> <p>Of course, this loathing is nothing personal - towards them, at least. We may detest their Rainmates, their tartan shopping trolleys, their dithering in M&amp; S and their doddering down the street, but we do so generically and instinctively. We don't care whether they are a veteran of the suffragette movement (Margaret, 94), a Parkinson's sufferer and campaigner for pensioners' rights (Zelda, 77), or a pet bereavement counsellor and Mrs Pepperpot lookalike (Rita, 88-and-a-half). </p> <p>We reduce these people down to a collection of cliches - rheumy eyes and Rainmates, for example - until they are just old. And then we hate them for it. We do this for the same reason we don't like fat people or people with disabilities: because they remind us of our own frailty, the inevitability of our own mortality. There, but for the grace of God, we go. Unfortunately for them, old people are the unwelcome reminder that one day, God will stop being quite so graceful. </p> <p>When, in one of Through The Eyes Of The Old's many poignant moments, Margaret explained how suddenly old age creeps up on you - \"It's like waking up, looking in the mirror and a different face being there. It's not you any more\" - she articulated one of our greatest fears. When Zelda confessed how she hates not being in control of her body, she expressed another. Strokes, arthritis, cataracts, incontinence: it's all in store for all of us. </p> <p>But not all of us. Maurice Chevalier said he preferred old age to the alternative, but there are those who would disagree, however subconsciously. </p> <p>If you can live fast, die young and leave a beautiful corpse, who'd be old and wrinkled and despised by society? Worse, who'd be erased from a youth-obsessed society like a vanished commissar? You have to stop being a kidult sometime. Old age, as Bette Davis rightly observed, isn't for sissies. </p> <p>Through The Eyes Of The Old may have been overlong but it was an admirable, brave and engaging documentary.

      "body": "<p>What would happen to your nervous system if you stared intently into the eyes of Michelle Pfeiffer for two minutes? One of several possible answers can be inferred from a paper recently published in Nature Neuroscience. The eyes of Ms Pfeiffer, as you may have observed, are unusually far apart. On the continuum leading from rabbits to foxes, she is definitely the hunted rather than the hunter. </p> <p>The authors of the Nature Neuroscience paper have discovered that staring at an unusual face for a while makes other faces seem distorted in the opposite direction. Staring at Ms Pfeiffer would probably cause you to see the eyes of ordinary faces as unusually close together, like those of tennis player Bjorn Borg. </p> <p>People in the trade call this kind of distortion \"sensory adaptation\". We often stare for hours on end at images in an attempt to alter our brain, though seldom do we see such interesting images as that of Michelle Pfeiffer. In fact, most adaptation experiments are so mind-numbingly boring that the method could only have been invented by the Germans, according to William James. </p> <p>A classical example of sensory adaptation is the waterfall effect. In 1834 the physicist R Addams visited the Fall of Foyers, near Loch Ness. In his own words: \"Having steadfastly looked for a few seconds at a particular part of the cascade, admiring the confluence and decussation of the currents forming the liquid drapery of waters, and then suddenly directed my eyes to the left, to observe the vertical face of the sombre age-worn rocks immediately contiguous to the waterfall, I saw the rocky surface as if in motion upwards\". </p> <p>The effect had previously been observed in the Austro-Hungarian Empire after inspecting columns of marching troops. With typical technical ingenuity, psychologists have managed to bring the waterfall effect into the laboratory and prove that it really exists. Over 1,000 scientific papers have been published on the phenomenon. Marlowe (the private eye, not the playwright) said that chess was the most elaborate waste of human effort to be found outside of an advertising agency. He was mistaken. </p> <p>The waterfall effect is usually explained by fatigue in sensory nerve cells. We know that many nerve cells in the visual pathway respond vigorously to movement on the retina, and that each cell has it own preferred direction of motion. Since a particular moving object, and even a stationary one, stimulates all these cells to some extent, but some more than others, the perceived direction of movement must depend upon a delicate balance in the population of cells as a whole. In effect, perception is decided by a vote in which every cell has a voice. If one kind of cell is repeatedly stimulated by movement in its preferred direction, it becomes fatigued and its voice is diminished. When the movement stops, the overall vote goes in the opposite direction. The same is seen with colour. Adapting to a bright red swatch makes a yellow swatch look green. This is how we know that the perception of yellow depends upon a hung vote between the reds and the greens. </p> <p>In the face adaptation experiment, people were shown computer-processed images of faces which could be distorted to exaggerate features such as the distance between the eyes. They learned to distinguish between \"Adam\" and \"Anti-Adam\", who were distorted in opposite directions. They then adapted for several minutes to Adam. Finally, they were shown a face midway between Adam and Anti-Adam; adaptation to Adam made them more likely to classify the intermediate face as Anti-Adam. The logic of adaptation experiments leads us to infer that face perception depends on an electoral contest between cells specialised to detect certain facial features, like the distance between the eyes. After adaptation to Michelle Pfeiffer, the ayes narrowly have it. </p> <p>A final twist has been provided by Peter Thompson, a psychologist at the University of York, who asked people to estimate the distance between their own eyes, in centimetres or inches. You might like to try this yourself before reading what Thompson found. Think how your eyes look in the mirror. How far are they apart? Three inches? Most people over-estimate their inter-pupillary distance. Why they do so is as big a mystery as why the experiment was done in the first place. The Committee Internationale des Mesures Inutiles has defined the milli-Helen as the amount of pulchritude required to launch one ship. If the Pfeiffer be adapted as the unit of inter-ocular distance. I calculate the average overestimation by people of their own interocular distance as about 50 milli-Pfeiffers. </p> <p>\u0095 Professor Michael Morgan is at the applied vision research centre of the City University</p>",

Since a particular moving object, and even a stationary one, stimulates all these cells to some extent, but some more than others, the perceived direction of movement must depend upon a delicate balance in the population of cells as a whole. In effect, perception is decided by a vote in which every cell has a voice. If one kind of cell is repeatedly stimulated by movement in its preferred direction, it becomes fatigued and its voice is diminished. When the movement stops, the overall vote goes in the opposite direction. The same is seen with colour. Adapting to a bright red swatch makes a yellow swatch look green. This is how we know that the perception of yellow depends upon a hung vote between the reds and the greens. In the face adaptation experiment, people were shown computer-processed images of faces which could be distorted to exaggerate features such as the distance between the eyes. They learned to distinguish between \"Adam\" and \"Anti-Adam\", who were distorted in opposite directions. They then adapted for several minutes to Adam. Finally, they were shown a face midway between Adam and Anti-Adam; adaptation to Adam made them more likely to classify the intermediate face as Anti-Adam. The logic of adaptation experiments leads us to infer that face perception depends on an electoral contest between cells specialised to detect certain facial features, like the distance between the eyes. After adaptation to Michelle Pfeiffer, the ayes narrowly have it. A final twist has been provided by Peter Thompson, a psychologist at the University of York, who asked people to estimate the distance between their own eyes, in centimetres or inches. You might like to try this yourself before reading what Thompson found. Think how your eyes look in the mirror. How far are they apart? Three inches? Most people over-estimate their inter-pupillary distance. Why they do so is as big a mystery as why the experiment was done in the first place. The Committee Internationale des Mesures Inutiles has defined the milli-Helen as the amount of pulchritude required to launch one ship. If the Pfeiffer be adapted as the unit of inter-ocular distance. I calculate the average overestimation by people of their own interocular distance as about 50 milli-Pfeiffers. \u0095 Professor Michael Morgan is at the applied vision research centre of the City University",

      "body": "<p>Dora Scarlett, who has died aged 95, was a writer, broadcaster, communist activist, and above all the founder and driving force of an organisation providing medical care to the poor in India.</p> <p>But, throughout her life, her real love was gardening and living a simple rural existence. Her last 40 years were spent in India, where she started a rural clinic giving free treatment to poor villagers. From very simple beginnings it grew to encompass three health and development organisations working with hundreds of thousands of poor and marginalised people. Dora was made an MBE in 1994.</p> <p>The daughter of a schoolteacher, Dora grew up modestly in Liverpool, with strong memories of the strange plants in the Sefton Park glasshouse. She shone at school, but refused the expected move to university, because she was more interested in horticulture. She worked first on a chicken farm in Oxfordshire and later farmed her own smallholding in Devon. There, long before the idea became fashionable in the 1970s, self-sufficiency and simple living appealed to her.</p> <p>She became involved with the Communist party, and after the war went at the party's instruction to Hungary to work as a broadcaster for Radio Budapest. She was supposed to beam stories of a communist paradise to British audiences, but found herself increasingly disillusioned with communism - and equally taken with the peasant life of eastern Europe. When the Soviet invasion came in 1956, Dora left in a hurry, with the help of the British embassy. Back in London, she left the party and wrote a book about her experiences, Window Onto Hungary. She then spent several less than happy years in London, and in 1959, without telling a soul, she left. Six weeks later she was in Madras, after travelling by cargo ship.</p> <p>Having found the simple rural life, Dora was soon working in a village clinic outside Madras. She formed a friendship with a local farmer and his wife, and together they went deep into south India, finally settling some way west of the ancient temple city of Madurai, in the foothills of the Western Ghats, which run down the spine of India. Here was a place remote from the modern world, with empty land and little in the way of medical facilities.</p> <p>Dora sometimes recalled those early days, which must have been the high spot of her life: finding the land, divining water, digging an open well, the first crops on hitherto unused soil. She told of trudging from village to village with a bag of basic medicines, learning how people lived. And she had special memories of the first western volunteers - American Peace Corps members at the time of Vietnam - and how they toiled all day in the heat, digging pits to plant the coconut trees that now ring the place she called Seva Nilayam, or Home of Service.</p> <p>Everything was to be modest - the buildings of mud and tile in the local style, traditional farming methods and an absence of vehicles. Certainly antibiotics were to be used where needed, but simple homespun medicine would serve where they were not. Seva Nilayam soon had a reputation for caring as well as effective treatment, and for being welcoming to the poorest and least regarded.</p> <p>Seva Nilayam attracted volunteers from around the world, and funding from Switzerland, Denmark, Australia, the US and Britain. The centre took \"in-patients\", but not conventionally on rows of beds in wards. Rather, these were patients who needed rest and good food as much as treatment, or who lived too far away to attend daily. The in-patients were part of the community, some staying a few days or weeks, others much longer. They helped out in the farm, garden, kitchen or clinic, in an environment not much different from that of their village.</p> <p>In the 1970s, a new challenge arose. Western development agencies were moving to more progressive policies - preferring preventative to curative medical work. Dora's philosophy was that westerners had no right to impose their views on what Indian society might or might not need. Undeterred by the loss of funding from agencies, she became her own fundraiser. Sitting on a wooden stool in a mud-walled building, bashing at a 1920s typewriter, she composed a letter that started: \"I am writing to you from a remote corner of India . . .\" and mailed copies to all the people she could think of.</p> <p>She believed that if you simply stated your need, people would respond. And they did. Soon Dora was writing a bi-monthly newsletter; not appealing for money but describing the life she saw around her in clinic, village or further afield in India, and adding her insights. Over the years these letters - each one a wonderful read - came to comprise a very individual statement about Dora Scarlett and her life and work in India.</p> <p>Many compared her beliefs to those of Gandhi - whom she had met in the 1930s when he visited London. She recalled taking early morning walks with him in the East End and being deeply impressed by his presence. But she always insisted her ideas were her own. Dora Scarlett's collected letters and information about her work are available from a UK registered charity that supports Seva Nilayam: Village Service Trust, Shoreditch Town Hall, 380 Old Street, London EC1V 9LT, telephone and fax 020-7739 9630, email: <a href=\"mailto:villageservicetrust@lineone.net\">villageservicetrust@lineone.net</a></p> <p>As disabilities of sight and hearing grew in old age, Dora stepped back and the Seva Nilayam board appointed a director to manage the organisation. She remained at Seva Nilayam, taking an interest in the clinic and garden, and in turn being cared for. In her later years she returned to the Catholicism of her upbringing.</p> <p>But Seva Nilayam had always embraced all faiths, indeed it was predominantly Hindu in its customs. So naturally her funeral followed local custom. Hundreds of local people attended the simple burial service in the beautiful garden she had created at Seva Nilayam.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Nicholas Hammond, who has died aged 93, was a classical scholar of great distinction and prodigious output. Like that of a number of his classicist and archaeologist contemporaries, his knowledge of Greece, its modern language and topography were put to good service by the Special Operations Executive (SOE) in occupied Greece during the second world war.</p> <p>He won scholarships to Fettes College and Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. After an outstanding performance in the classical tripos, he was elected a fellow of Clare College, Cambridge, at the age of 22. Summer vacations in the 1930s were spent in feats of walking that led to the unrivalled knowledge of the topography of northern Greece and southern Albania that was to stand him in such good stead during the war. His first-hand knowledge of Greece and its modern language (he also spoke Albanian) made him an obvious recruit for SOE.</p> <p>When SOE first tried to send him into Greece in the summer of 1940, in the hope that he would be able to foment resistance in Italian-occupied Albania, he was denied entry by the suspicious Greek authorities. Once Greece had entered the war, their attitude changed, and he was allowed into the country in March 1941. On behalf of SOE, he taught sabotage techniques to Greeks, many of them communists, who were intended to act as the nucleus of post-occupation resistance groups. When the Germans invaded Greece in April 1941, he himself destroyed stockpiles of material of use to the enemy. He made the rendezvous with the ca\u00efque that was to evacuate him to Crete with only minutes to spare.</p> <p>His SOE activities continued on Crete in the month before the German airborne attack on the island, one of his last acts being to blow up the ammunition dump that SOE had established on an island in Suda Bay. He had a narrow escape when two members of the crew of the ca\u00efque on which he withdrew to Egypt were killed in an air attack. On arrival in Alexandria, Hammond was invited to dinner by an admiral who sought, without success, to convince him that the Odyssey had been written by a woman.</p> <p>Hammond's expertise in sabotage techniques was deployed to good effect at SOE's training school in Haifa, where Moshe Dayan was one of his pupils. After SOE's success, in collaboration with Greek resistance groups, in blowing up the Gorgopotamos railway viaduct in November 1942, the military authorities in the Middle East gave a high priority to subversion in Greece, and Hammond was parachuted into Thessaly in February 1943. He experienced a hard landing and was knocked unconscious. At 35, he was 10 or more years older than most British liaison officers, and one of the very few who was already married.</p> <p>Among his many exploits was a perilous clandestine journey to Thessaloniki disguised as a Vlach shepherd visiting the big city. So effective was the heavily-moustachioed Hammond's disguise that he was asked for advice on cheese-making. Like many British liaison officers, he was frustrated by the amount of time he had to spend on politics and on trying to keep the peace between rival resistance groups, and his experiences led him to develop a marked antipathy towards the largest of these, the communist-controlled AM/ELAS.</p> <p>In the summer of 1944, he temporarily assumed com mand of the Allied military mission to the Greek resistance. In this capacity he was responsible for handling the totally unexpected and precipitate arrival of a Soviet military mission in Greece. He established a good rapport with his Soviet opposite number, the enigmatic and reticent Colonel Grigorii Popov, at a series of \"teas\". At one of these, hosted by Popov and consisting of a saucer of sliced tomatoes washed down with bottles of whisky, vodka and Georgian brandy, with a demijohn of ouzo in reserve, all five colonels present - three Russian, one American and one British (Hammond himself) - passed out, but without any of them revealing anything of substance about their respective missions.</p> <p>Venture Into Greece, Hammond's memoir of his wartime service - for which he was awarded the DSO and the Greek Order of the Phoenix - was written while he was recuperating in hospital after being evacuated from Greece in September 1944. It was not published until 1983, a time when Britain's wartime role was the subject of impassioned debate in Greece.</p> <p>After the war, Hammond returned as senior tutor to Clare College, where he remained until 1954, when he became headmaster of Clifton College, Bristol. In 1962 he was appointed professor of Greek at Bristol University, a post which he held until his retirement in 1973. He subsequently held a number of appointments as visiting professor at American and Australian universities. He served both as president of the Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies and as chairman of the British School at Athens, and was elected a member of the British Academy in 1968.</p> <p>As don, as schoolmaster and in retirement, he published at a rapid rate, focusing in particular on the history of ancient Macedonia and Epirus, his research being informed by his intimate knowledge of the topography of these regions. In 1993, he published a further volume on the Allied military mission and the resistance in Western Macedonia.</p> <p>When the Yugoslav republic of Macedonia emerged as an independent state in 1991, Hammond became a popular figure in Greece when he backed Greek protests that the Macedonians had plundered a name, Macedonia, and a symbol, the 16-pointed Star of Vergina, to which Greece claimed exclusive title. His suggestion, however, that the new state be given the ancient name of Paeonia was never very realistic. He retained his interest in Greek affairs until the very end.</p> <p>Three weeks before his death, he and three Cambridge colleagues drew attention in a letter to the press to the threat to the site of the battle of Marathon posed by Greek plans for the 2004 Olympics.</p> <p>He is survived by his wife Margaret and their two sons and two daughters. Another daughter predeceased him.</p> <p>\u0095 Nicholas Geoffrey Lempri\u00e8re Hammond, academic and resistance hero, born November 15 1907; died March 24 2001.</p>",

His SOE activities continued on Crete in the month before the German airborne attack on the island, one of his last acts being to blow up the ammunition dump that SOE had established on an island in Suda Bay. He had a narrow escape when two members of the crew of the ca\u00efque on which he withdrew to Egypt were killed in an air attack. On arrival in Alexandria, Hammond was invited to dinner by an admiral who sought, without success, to convince him that the Odyssey had been written by a woman. Hammond's expertise in sabotage techniques was deployed to good effect at SOE's training school in Haifa, where Moshe Dayan was one of his pupils. After SOE's success, in collaboration with Greek resistance groups, in blowing up the Gorgopotamos railway viaduct in November 1942, the military authorities in the Middle East gave a high priority to subversion in Greece, and Hammond was parachuted into Thessaly in February 1943. He experienced a hard landing and was knocked unconscious. At 35, he was 10 or more years older than most British liaison officers, and one of the very few who was already married. Among his many exploits was a perilous clandestine journey to Thessaloniki disguised as a Vlach shepherd visiting the big city. So effective was the heavily-moustachioed Hammond's disguise that he was asked for advice on cheese-making. Like many British liaison officers, he was frustrated by the amount of time he had to spend on politics and on trying to keep the peace between rival resistance groups, and his experiences led him to develop a marked antipathy towards the largest of these, the communist-controlled AM/ELAS. In the summer of 1944, he temporarily assumed com mand of the Allied military mission to the Greek resistance. In this capacity he was responsible for handling the totally unexpected and precipitate arrival of a Soviet military mission in Greece. He established a good rapport with his Soviet opposite number, the enigmatic and reticent Colonel Grigorii Popov, at a series of \"teas\". At one of these, hosted by Popov and consisting of a saucer of sliced tomatoes washed down with bottles of whisky, vodka and Georgian brandy, with a demijohn of ouzo in reserve, all five colonels present - three Russian, one American and one British (Hammond himself) - passed out, but without any of them revealing anything of substance about their respective missions. Venture Into Greece, Hammond's memoir of his wartime service - for which he was awarded the DSO and the Greek Order of the Phoenix - was written while he was recuperating in hospital after being evacuated from Greece in September 1944. It was not published until 1983, a time when Britain's wartime role was the subject of impassioned debate in Greece. After the war, Hammond returned as senior tutor to Clare College, where he remained until 1954, when he became headmaster of Clifton College, Bristol. In 1962 he was appointed professor of Greek at Bristol University, a post which he held until his retirement in 1973. He subsequently held a number of appointments as visiting professor at American and Australian universities. He served both as president of the Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies and as chairman of the British School at Athens, and was elected a member of the British Academy in 1968. As don, as schoolmaster and in retirement, he published at a rapid rate, focusing in particular on the history of ancient Macedonia and Epirus, his research being informed by his intimate knowledge of the topography of these regions. In 1993, he published a further volume on the Allied military mission and the resistance in Western Macedonia. When the Yugoslav republic of Macedonia emerged as an independent state in 1991, Hammond became a popular figure in Greece when he backed Greek protests that the Macedonians had plundered a name, Macedonia, and a symbol, the 16-pointed Star of Vergina, to which Greece claimed exclusive title. His suggestion, however, that the new state be given the ancient name of Paeonia was never very realistic. He retained his interest in Greek affairs until the very end. Three weeks before his death, he and three Cambridge colleagues drew attention in a letter to the press to the threat to the site of the battle of Marathon posed by Greek plans for the 2004 Olympics. He is survived by his wife Margaret and their two sons and two daughters. Another daughter predeceased him. \u0095 Nicholas Geoffrey Lempri\u00e8re Hammond, academic and resistance hero, born November 15 1907; died March 24 2001.",

      "body": "<p>Anyone would think an election was in the offing. Suddenly, the political spotlight is back on women's votes, and poor Worcester Woman is once more being dragged from her people carrier to account for her voting preferences. As the party war rooms gear up for the probable June 7 election, a survey out today finds that women are sceptical that any political party really has their interests at heart.</p> <p>The poll, which was conducted for Good Housekeeping magazine, found that 29% felt Labour best served women's interests, while just 13% thought the Conservatives put their concerns first and a mere 9% chose the Lib Dems.</p> <p>Within the Labour and Conservative parties, meanwhile, women are fighting to convince strategists that an appeal to the female vote is vital. Women's ministers Baroness Jay and Tessa Jowell and the employment minister Margaret Hodge are warning Downing Street that it cannot continue to sideline issues such as new rights to flexible working if it hopes to maintain Labour's 1997 record in winning over women.</p> <p>In Conservative central office, meanwhile, there are suggestions to compel the frequently reactionary local selection boards to include women on their future lists of potential Westminster candidates, as the party finds it has once again failed to select more than a handful of women in winnable seats.</p> <p>Amid such last-minute scrambling to woo the women's vote, new research to be published next week suggests the pattern of female voting in Britain may be undergoing a sea-change which will require the Conservatives, in particular, to try far harder to win women's support.</p> <p>An analysis by Rosie Campbell, a researcher at Birkbeck College, of the 1997 British election study - a major survey of more than 3,500 voters examining voting preferences and a wide array of other data - suggests that women's traditional voting patterns are moving from right to left.</p> <p>Where once women were generally more Conservative than men, except for the youngest age group, women are now staying leftwing longer. In 1979, only women in the under-25 age group were more likely to vote Labour than their male counterparts; by 1992, that trend had extended to the under-35s, and in 1997, women up to 45. \"The age at which women are more likely than men to vote Labour is creeping up,\" says Campbell, who will be presenting her findings at a Political Studies Association conference in Manchester. \"What we are seeing is a new trend in women's voting.\"</p> <p>The shift could mean that Britain may be starting to follow the example of the US, where women are more leftwing than men in all age groups. The gender voting gap in the recent Bush-Gore US presidential race is estimated at some 20 points, with women strongly favouring the Democrat candidate.</p> <p>It certainly seems true that young women are more left-leaning than young men - a trend that, according to recent research by the Harvard academic Pippa Norris, is found generally across western post-industrial countries.</p> <p>The reasons may be various but, Campbell suggests, a link is likely with the changing lives of women, who are now more likely to go to work and return after having children than their grandmothers, and to base their vote on the public as well as the domestic sphere.</p> <p>The findings undoubtedly make bleak reading for William Hague, whose party is stuck at around 34% in the polls with little expectation of a miraculous reversal on polling day. The image of the loyal legions of sturdy matrons waving their union flags at Tory conference was already looking outdated: the Campbell study appears to confirm that the death knell is sounding for the blue-rinse brigade who for so long formed the backbone of the party.</p> <p>Tessa Keswick, director of the centre for policy studies and a fierce Tory campaigner for reforms to win more female MPs and voters to the party, readily acknowledges women voters' drift towards Labour. \"Women have very different interests from men and face absolutely different essential life choices,\" she says. \"I think the Conservatives have been left behind in addressing those concerns. Even among older women now Labour is winning support - it has done a lot for the pensioners, so even among the older vote there has been a strong move against the Tories.\"</p> <p>While Labour developed a strategy to win women in the late 80s and 90s, the Conservatives did not, Keswick points out. This time, there will be real post-election changes to try to secure more female Westminster candidates, she says: \"At a senior level, some steps have been taken, but it has not really translated into anything very obvious to the public.\"</p> <p>But the Conservatives' battle to bring back women voters will have to be much bigger than a drive to select more candidates. Mary-Ann Stephenson, director of the women's campaign group the Fawcett Society, suggests the shift to the left among women could be linked to fundamental changes in the Labour party. The party's strong union links and \"blokeish\" image used to put women off, so the loosening of those connections and \"women-friendly\" changes in the unions have attracted female voters.</p> <p>\"At the same time,\" Stephenson says, \"more women have begun to work outside the home, and they do not see the Conservative party offering a role for women. These voting changes suggest the gender gap is not a given - that women are somehow genetically conservative - but it is related to what is going on in women's lives, and what is going on within the parties.\"</p> <p>But while the Campbell research appears to be good news for Labour, Tony Blair should avoid getting too smug. Labour still has to deal with the enemy of all parties - apathy. \"There is a shift for women to be more leftwing than men in the younger age ranges, but what the Labour party has to do is mobilise that into votes,\" Campbell says. \"If women are turned off by the [electoral] process, they may sympathise with traditionally Labour issues, but not turn out on polling day.\"</p> <p>The Good Housekeeping poll suggests that, while women were more likely than men to vote in the last general election, an enormous 42% of women in the 18-24 age group and a quarter of the 25-34 age group are not planning to vote in the forthcoming election. And, for all that they appear to be left-leaning, women are also the most volatile voters - the survey finds only 17% putting party loyalty first when deciding how to vote, while 56% vote on the basis of policies.</p> <p>It is also possible that, after four years of new Labour, the optimism reflected in the 1997 survey data and Labour's election landslide could have faded. Fawcett research published in February highlighted a \"dissatisfaction gap\", with only 31% of women compared with 40% of men saying they were satisfied with the government.</p> <p>Polling expert Deborah Mattinson, who has conducted focus group research among women voters for the Labour party, is sceptical even of the suggestion that women are staying leftwing longer. \"The gender gap has had a lot to do with the parties and how, historically, they have been perceived. In the 70s, the Tories had a very positive image among women which has gradually faded. I don't particularly see evidence that women are changing their views - they remain the most volatile part of the electorate and it could be that when Tony Blair's gloss fades off and the Tories have a new leader who women like, the vote will swing back.\"</p> <p>Harriet Harman, former social security secretary and a consistent campaigner for greater Labour moves to woo women voters during this parliament, is urging her party not to let its new attractiveness to women fade. \"We need to entrench women's support for Labour, and that means not only policies such as flexible working rights but also women sharing power in the party. That is why there is such a worry that our record number of women MPs could go down.\"</p> <p>A shift of views among younger women may be less a rush from the arms of Labour to the Tories but something subtler, according to the feminist writer Beatrix Campbell. \"It is not so much that Labour is changing the minds of women voters - neither Labour or the Conservatives dare engage with women on anything that matters, and both will scurry into the arms of the Institute of Directors rather than consult women. It may be that women are more confidently in the progressive portion of society, but that may bear no relationship to the party system - hence this suggestion that so few will vote.</p> <p>\"And if young women don't vote, that is very worrying for new Labour, and very, very worrying for society.\"</p> <p><b>Poll positions</b><br></p> <p><b> Good Housekeeping surveyed 1,000 women - here's what they said:</b></p> <p><b>How will the floaters vote?</b></p> <p>\u0095 56% of women said policies were their priority.</p> <p>\u0095 Loyalty to a party scored just 17%</p> <p>\u0095 Two million more women than men voted in the last election</p> <p>\u0095 42% of 18 to 24-year-olds and 25% of 25 to 34-year-old women will not vote at all</p> <p>\u0095 Only 2% of women are swayed by how partners vote</p> <p><b> Which party best serves women?</b></p> <p>\u0095 29% said New Labour</p> <p>\u0095 13% chose Conservative and only 9% went for the Liberal Democrats</p> <p><b> What women really want </b></p> <p>\u0095 Health is top priority for 60%</p> <p>\u0095 Education scores second at 17%</p> <p>\u0095 Environment comes first for 10%</p> <p>\u0095 Just 4% put taxation first</p> <p><b> Women's favourites</b></p> <p>\u0095 More than 25% of women vote Tony Blair the most attractive politician</p> <p>\u0095 William Hague, beaten by Charles Kennedy and Michael Portillo, polled just 4% but he fared better than Mandelson, Brown and Cook</p> <p>\u0095 Blair is the most admired politician (26%) although a quarter of women didn't admire any of those listed</p> <p>\u0095 William Hague and Ann Widdecombe won just 10% each of the most-admired politician vote</p> <p><b> Should we bring back Thatcher? </b></p> <p>\u0095 More than 40% of women would welcome Lady Thatcher back as leader</p> <p>\u0095 But another 37% think she didn't actually do the country any good at all</p>",

It may be that women are more confidently in the progressive portion of society, but that may bear no relationship to the party system - hence this suggestion that so few will vote. \"And if young women don't vote, that is very worrying for new Labour, and very, very worrying for society.\" Poll positions Good Housekeeping surveyed 1,000 women - here's what they said: How will the floaters vote? \u0095 56% of women said policies were their priority. \u0095 Loyalty to a party scored just 17% \u0095 Two million more women than men voted in the last election \u0095 42% of 18 to 24-year-olds and 25% of 25 to 34-year-old women will not vote at all \u0095 Only 2% of women are swayed by how partners vote Which party best serves women? \u0095 29% said New Labour \u0095 13% chose Conservative and only 9% went for the Liberal Democrats What women really want \u0095 Health is top priority for 60% \u0095 Education scores second at 17% \u0095 Environment comes first for 10% \u0095 Just 4% put taxation first Women's favourites \u0095 More than 25% of women vote Tony Blair the most attractive politician \u0095 William Hague, beaten by Charles Kennedy and Michael Portillo, polled just 4% but he fared better than Mandelson, Brown and Cook \u0095 Blair is the most admired politician (26%) although a quarter of women didn't admire any of those listed \u0095 William Hague and Ann Widdecombe won just 10% each of the most-admired politician vote Should we bring back Thatcher? \u0095 More than 40% of women would welcome Lady Thatcher back as leader \u0095 But another 37% think she didn't actually do the country any good at all",

      "bodyText": "The former wife of Neal Cassady, one of the two central figures in Jack Kerouac's novel On the Road, yesterday denounced as \"blasphemy\" an auction at which the original manuscript of the story is expected to sell for up to $1.5m. Carolyn Cassady, who appears as a character in the novel, now lives at Bracknell, Berkshire. She is the most eminent and intimate survivor from the personalities of the early Beat generation. She called the sale a tragedy. The manuscript was expected to be acquired for display at New York public library, which held it for some years. But its owner, Tony Sampas, who inherited it through the family of Kerouac's third wife, explained the decision to offer it to private collectors by telling the New York Times: \"We have a financial imperative. I have an estate to settle and some bills.\" Christie's, which is holding the auction in New York on May 22, said the first version of one of the 20th century's most influential literary bestsellers should reach the same price league as a manuscript by Kafka, Joyce or Proust. On the Road still sells 110,000-130,000 copies a year. For sale is the 120ft long scroll of tracing paper on which Kerouac wrote his account of the \"irresponsible wanderlust of the soul\" in a three-week burst. April 22 will be the 50th anniversary of the day he finished writing it in 1951. He wrote soon afterwards to his closest friend, Neal Cassady, who is called Dean Moriarty in the novel: \"Story deals with you and me on the road... marks complete departure from previous American Lit[erature].\" His original title for the novel, heavily revised before it was published in 1957, was Visions of Neal. Carolyn Cassady, 78, said: \"He typed a lot of it on my college typewriter in my attic - he liked it because it was my sister's. She was educated in Europe, so it had European punctuation, which he preferred. \"I will always remember how concentrated he was on writing, how rapidly he typed and that I had to furnish him with a lot of coffee.\" Cassady died in 1968, Kerouac in 1969. Carolyn, mother of Neal's three children, had a long affair with Kerouac at her husband's suggestion. She divorced Cassady in 1967 after 17 years of marriage, but they remained close.

Calls to a TUC hotline showed the two main complaints to be stringent rules about spending any time in the loo, and a lack of adequate rest breaks during long shifts. A breakdown of 733 calls received since February 12 found one in four call handlers was unhappy about the extreme levels of supervision. Workers frequently had to ask permission to go the lavatory and some had been required to explain why they went so often, the TUC said. In one case, it was alleged, a manager produced disposable nappies and threatened that whoever made the most visits would be made to wear one. The report is part of a campaign to improve conditions in the call centre industry, which employs 400,000 in the UK. Long term damage to health was another prominent complaint; more than one in 10 callers mentioning symptoms ranging from hearing problems to work-related stress. One worker admitted dreading night shifts because there was no policy for dealing with abusive callers though staff were banned from hanging up.

The lucky few had a flushing toilet and a cold tap that worked.</p> <p>In years to come, it will be last night and this morning that I will remember from the trek. During an evening impromtu firework display, the last and loudest caught fire on the dry foliage on the hillside above us and spread quickly. A combined force of guests and staff soon put it out.</p> <p>In the morning there was ice on the ground and no showers for any of us. However a cheerful breakfast of burgers (eggs and spam) and porridge greeted us. As coffee came readymade with milk and sugar, I just had hot water as my morning beverage. </p> <p>Today's trek was entirely on a tarmac road through the Yunmang Shan national park. The rock formations, peaks and deep, deep valleys were amazing and we walked under clear blue skies in T-shirt temperatures.</p> <p>The trek gave me plenty of time for reflection. I have been an individual member of the British Agencies for Fostering and Adoption (BAAF) for many years and have a longstanding love affair with the Far East. I had walked on the Great Wall before, so when BAAF's Great Walk of China flyer arrived through my letterbox it took only a short time to decide to join. All of the money we have raised has come from sponsorship, with BAAF in the UK and Care for Children in China as the beneficiaries. </p> <p>I have been a social worker since the 1970s and have specialised in adoption and fostering since 1977. I had spent all of my working life in councils until the past three years when I joined Father Hudson's Society, a voluntary agency based in the Midlands.</p> <p>My work now is mainly with adults, who either want to adopt or who have been adopted. We place children on behalf of authorities and in the past year we have placed 20 children for adoption including family groups of five, four and three children. We also have a small fostering project, so the fostering work of Care for Children is of special interest to me. I am glad its work is spreading beyond its starting base in Shanghai, though to do so it inevitably will have a constant need for funds.</p> <p>To return to the trek - after four hours our coach collected our tired and blistered group and took us to our hotel in Huarimo, a large and bustling town about an hour's drive from Beijing. The hot baths and showers were particularly welcome after our icy start to the day.</p> <p>There was time before the evening meal to visit the local shops. Our curiosity value to the local inhabitants once again proved amusing. As two of our members were celebrating birthdays, three of us stopped off at a local cake shop and emerged half an hour later with a birthday cake, decorated with a dragon amid a pattern of clouds and roses. All of the negotiations were conducted with paper and pencil, as language proved a distinct barrier. Photos of the cake artist and his wife were taken for posterity.</p> <p>Another memorable and exhausting day, rounded off with a warm bed and the prospect of our final day on the Great Wall at Mutianyu.</p>",

During an evening impromtu firework display, the last and loudest caught fire on the dry foliage on the hillside above us and spread quickly. A combined force of guests and staff soon put it out. In the morning there was ice on the ground and no showers for any of us. However a cheerful breakfast of burgers (eggs and spam) and porridge greeted us. As coffee came readymade with milk and sugar, I just had hot water as my morning beverage. Today's trek was entirely on a tarmac road through the Yunmang Shan national park. The rock formations, peaks and deep, deep valleys were amazing and we walked under clear blue skies in T-shirt temperatures. The trek gave me plenty of time for reflection. I have been an individual member of the British Agencies for Fostering and Adoption (BAAF) for many years and have a longstanding love affair with the Far East. I had walked on the Great Wall before, so when BAAF's Great Walk of China flyer arrived through my letterbox it took only a short time to decide to join. All of the money we have raised has come from sponsorship, with BAAF in the UK and Care for Children in China as the beneficiaries. I have been a social worker since the 1970s and have specialised in adoption and fostering since 1977. I had spent all of my working life in councils until the past three years when I joined Father Hudson's Society, a voluntary agency based in the Midlands. My work now is mainly with adults, who either want to adopt or who have been adopted. We place children on behalf of authorities and in the past year we have placed 20 children for adoption including family groups of five, four and three children. We also have a small fostering project, so the fostering work of Care for Children is of special interest to me. I am glad its work is spreading beyond its starting base in Shanghai, though to do so it inevitably will have a constant need for funds. To return to the trek - after four hours our coach collected our tired and blistered group and took us to our hotel in Huarimo, a large and bustling town about an hour's drive from Beijing. The hot baths and showers were particularly welcome after our icy start to the day. There was time before the evening meal to visit the local shops. Our curiosity value to the local inhabitants once again proved amusing. As two of our members were celebrating birthdays, three of us stopped off at a local cake shop and emerged half an hour later with a birthday cake, decorated with a dragon amid a pattern of clouds and roses. All of the negotiations were conducted with paper and pencil, as language proved a distinct barrier. Photos of the cake artist and his wife were taken for posterity. Another memorable and exhausting day, rounded off with a warm bed and the prospect of our final day on the Great Wall at Mutianyu.",

Wimbledon proved that by doing well in the top division year after year. </p> <p> \"It wasn't a great night for us but we are second at the end of it. The ball is still in our court.\" </p> <p> Warnock countered: \"I'd also be disappointed if I had Graeme's millions and didn't come away with a result. I don't know about calling us the new Wimbledon - we played some good football out there tonight. </p> <p> \"Still, I suppose I'd be a bit bitter if a club with a wage bill one sixth of my team's ended up getting a result. It would have been a crime if we had been beaten.\" </p> <p> Souness had stressed the need to compete first and play later against Warnock's feisty team and Berg gave Rovers the lead inside four minutes. The defender, a title winner with Blackburn six years ago, rose above Shaun Murphy to head Alan Mahon's free-kick past Simon Tracey for his first goal since returning to Ewood Park from Manchester United in September. </p> <p> But unlike Burnley, United were stung into action by the early goal. Robert Kozluk almost levelled on 25 minutes with a viciously struck effort from 25 yards that Brad Friedel did well to tip over. </p> <p> With United giving notice of regaining a foothold in the match as the second half got under way, Souness opted to dispense with the attacking skills of Eyal Berkovic in favour of a full-back, Stig Inge Bjornebye. Even so Matt Jansen soon went close when he cut inside the penalty area before seeing his left-foot shot hit the post. </p> <p> But United continued to press forward with the pacy strike partnership of Carl Asaba and Ndlovu. The marauding Ndlovu had terrible problems with Blackburn's offside trap but eventually broke through to make his point.</p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "bodyText": "Peter Ndlovu's late volley salvaged a point for Sheffield United against promotion-chasing Blackburn here last night, a deserved reward for a stirring second-half fightback by Neil Warnock's side that kept their play-off ambitions alive - and prompted the Rovers manager Graeme Souness to dismiss United as \"a modern-day Wimbledon\". The striker's equaliser, a fine chest trap and volley following Henning Berg's half-clearance, could not stop Rovers from returning to the automatic promotion places but certainly slowed the momentum the home side had built with Saturday's 5-0 romp over Burnley. \"They are in your face and they are good at it,\" Souness said. \"It's a simple style of football and not my way of playing the game, but it's effective. Wimbledon proved that by doing well in the top division year after year. \"It wasn't a great night for us but we are second at the end of it. The ball is still in our court.\" Warnock countered: \"I'd also be disappointed if I had Graeme's millions and didn't come away with a result. I don't know about calling us the new Wimbledon - we played some good football out there tonight. \"Still, I suppose I'd be a bit bitter if a club with a wage bill one sixth of my team's ended up getting a result. It would have been a crime if we had been beaten.\" Souness had stressed the need to compete first and play later against Warnock's feisty team and Berg gave Rovers the lead inside four minutes. The defender, a title winner with Blackburn six years ago, rose above Shaun Murphy to head Alan Mahon's free-kick past Simon Tracey for his first goal since returning to Ewood Park from Manchester United in September. But unlike Burnley, United were stung into action by the early goal. Robert Kozluk almost levelled on 25 minutes with a viciously struck effort from 25 yards that Brad Friedel did well to tip over. With United giving notice of regaining a foothold in the match as the second half got under way, Souness opted to dispense with the attacking skills of Eyal Berkovic in favour of a full-back, Stig Inge Bjornebye. Even so Matt Jansen soon went close when he cut inside the penalty area before seeing his left-foot shot hit the post. But United continued to press forward with the pacy strike partnership of Carl Asaba and Ndlovu. The marauding Ndlovu had terrible problems with Blackburn's offside trap but eventually broke through to make his point. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
