In his defence, Frank pleaded that if he had waited to eat it at home, his pizza would have been cold (it was a snowy night in Edinburgh). He was made to refund the \u00a350 fare and withstand a withering attack from both bosses. </p> <p>Frank was a sports journalist and as such fell into a category recognised by auditors as temperamentally inclined towards what they refer to as \"taking the piss\". Last week, an alleged expenses fraudster was exposed when an employment tribunal upheld a suit brought by Antonio Fernandes against Netcom Consultants in Reading. Netcom was found to have unfairly dismissed Fernandes after he blew the whistle on Steven Woodhouse, the boss who allegedly asked him to sign off bogus expenses amounting to \u00a3370,000. </p> <p>There is no better introduction to a business than its attitude towards expenses claims, since it relies on a combination of financial necessity and something more indefinable, something closer to what members of august old banking houses probably think of in terms of \"class\". The idea of having a written expenses policy, where you are told how much to spend on lunch and which class of travel to take, is still viewed with horror in certain quarters. These are the companies in which it is happily assumed that at a certain level within the hierarchy, you will enter a bubble-wrapped zone in which you can bank your income and charge all your daily expenses to the corporate AmEx. To question such a thing, as Antonio Fernandes did, is to risk looking terribly d\u00e9class\u00e9 and to lose one's job. </p> <p>\"We are told we can use our expenses to buy anything we wouldn't be ashamed of telling our client about,\" says a management consultant at one of the world's biggest firms. \"But nobody really checks.

Harbhajan Parwar, a trading standards officer from Birmingham, was sacked for faking petrol mileage claims to the tune of \u00a3115.

Chief superintendent Colin Macdonald from the West Midlands was convicted, in December 1998, of filing \u00a326,000 in bogus expenses claims based on undercover surveillance operations that never happened. He was jailed for two years and sacked from his \u00a355,000 per year post. And in 1997, BBC administrator Penelope Jefferson received a 12-month jail sentence for an expenses fiddle of \u00a334,000, though police estimated the total to be in excess of \u00a3100,000 over six years. Her fraud, carried out by altering the cash amounts on credit card slips and shop receipts, was discovered in a routine audit when a stationer's receipt for nearly \u00a33,000 was found to be based on an original bill of \u00a36.49. On another occasion, she took seven friends to lunch at a cost of \u00a3143.30, then used the receipt to claim \u00a3743.30 as business expenses. </p> <p>However, it was Roger Lyons, general secretary of the Manufacturing, Science and Finance Union, who last month emerged as the most intriguing of the expenses blaggers. When his claims were broken down, it became clear that he had blown over \u00a36,000 on assorted bric-a-brac and takeaways: a radio for the bathroom, bought because his partner couldn't stand listening to the Today programme in the bedroom, a video, an embarrassing claim for a 25p bun. He didn't sound like a man on a thieving spree so much as one enjoying a blanket expenses culture at odds with the industry he was in. </p> <p>\"What is acceptable to put down on expenses depends on who are seen to be the stakeholders in the organisation,\" says Professor Leo Murray, director of Cranfield School of Management. \"If you're working in the public sector, it's quite difficult to go and lunch at the Savoy because the stakeholders are people lying on trolleys in hospital corridors.\" </p> <p>Murray took up his position at Cranfield after working in the private sector as a manager in the consumer goods business. \"I found that people were very careful with the odd penny at Cranfield. I decided to loosen it up a bit and enforce a policy that if you had to travel on a plane for more than five hours, you could travel club class.\" </p> <p>Such enforcement of an expenses policy is becoming more standard now. \"It's amazing how many companies haven't got a clue how much they spend on travel and entertainment expenses,\" says Mike Platt, managing director of travel management company Hogg Robinson.

This is up from 3% in 1994, ranking it as a company's third largest controllable expense and one of the most easily exploitable for expenses scams. </p> <p>\"We went into a company that had a policy saying you must travel economy unless there are only first-class seats available on the date and time you have to travel,\" Platt says. \"So people were phoning up in advance and getting details of which flights were full [in the cheaper seats] and which weren't, then demanding a seat on the ones that were full.\" Only 51% of companies now assign tickets purely by the position of the traveller in a company's hierarchy, but it remains a delicate operation. There are egos to be tiptoed around, to the extent that British Airways has come up with a new class of travel - \"business economy\" - which separates executive flyers from the riffraff at the back of the plane, but with the key word \"economy\" in the title so it doesn't break company travel policy. </p> <p>The most efficient way of auditing expenses is either by taking a percentage sample or by targeting claims over a certain value, yet according to American Express, 54% of companies still audit every single claim - at a considerable cost.

      "body": "<p>Gabrielle shouldn't be a star, but here she is, emoting to a full Empire as if she's been waiting years for this. In many ways, she could only have happened in this country. Her voice is pleasant at best, with none of the aching highs and lows of the true (ie American) soul diva. Then there's her self-consciousness about what she considers to be \"my enormous butt and huge feet\", and the sunglasses worn to hide a droopy eye. To top it off, she utterly lacks the imperiousness of her US counterparts, chatting so easily that it wouldn't have seemed out of place if she'd invited us all back to her south London pad after the show. Whitney and Mariah would never permit such familiarity. </p> <p>Despite this, Gabrielle is the closest thing Britain's got to a soul superstar. The album Rise and its title track are among this year's biggest hits, reinstating her after a fallow period during which it looked as if she'd never match the success of her 1993 debut, Dreams. In that time she only hit the headlines when her son's father was convicted of murdering his stepfather, an incident that led to the redemptive Rise. </p> <p>Her acoustic version has people swaying to its soothing chorus: \"I'm building bridges from these scenes, now I'm ready to rise again\". Like many of her tunes, the sentiment is anodyne, but her warm delivery invests it with meaning. She carries the whole show, in fact, by force of personality, transforming MOR torch songs such as If You Cared into intimate slices of life by singing imperfectly and making up for it with an apologetic smile. If you want perfection, she semaphores, go see Whitney, but if you want real life, albeit glossily packaged (indeed, she's nothing short of gorgeous in floor-length white and the ubiquitous shades), I'm your girl. </p> <p>The show does follow R&amp;B tradition after a fashion, but where Houston would have a slick session band, Gabs had a comfy crew that looked like her Brockley mates; where Whitney would have 10 dancers, Gabrielle had four, frugging old-fashionedly to the Motownish new single, When a Woman. And where La Houston would have a lackey dabbing away perspiration, Gabrielle mopped her face with an inelegant blue towel. Maybe it was that towel, but by the end you felt a lot better about the world. </p> <p> Until tonight. Box office: 020-7771 2000, then touring.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Gabrielle shouldn't be a star, but here she is, emoting to a full Empire as if she's been waiting years for this. In many ways, she could only have happened in this country. Her voice is pleasant at best, with none of the aching highs and lows of the true (ie American) soul diva. Then there's her self-consciousness about what she considers to be \"my enormous butt and huge feet\", and the sunglasses worn to hide a droopy eye. To top it off, she utterly lacks the imperiousness of her US counterparts, chatting so easily that it wouldn't have seemed out of place if she'd invited us all back to her south London pad after the show. Whitney and Mariah would never permit such familiarity. Despite this, Gabrielle is the closest thing Britain's got to a soul superstar. The album Rise and its title track are among this year's biggest hits, reinstating her after a fallow period during which it looked as if she'd never match the success of her 1993 debut, Dreams. In that time she only hit the headlines when her son's father was convicted of murdering his stepfather, an incident that led to the redemptive Rise. Her acoustic version has people swaying to its soothing chorus: \"I'm building bridges from these scenes, now I'm ready to rise again\". Like many of her tunes, the sentiment is anodyne, but her warm delivery invests it with meaning. She carries the whole show, in fact, by force of personality, transforming MOR torch songs such as If You Cared into intimate slices of life by singing imperfectly and making up for it with an apologetic smile. If you want perfection, she semaphores, go see Whitney, but if you want real life, albeit glossily packaged (indeed, she's nothing short of gorgeous in floor-length white and the ubiquitous shades), I'm your girl. The show does follow R&amp;B tradition after a fashion, but where Houston would have a slick session band, Gabs had a comfy crew that looked like her Brockley mates; where Whitney would have 10 dancers, Gabrielle had four, frugging old-fashionedly to the Motownish new single, When a Woman. And where La Houston would have a lackey dabbing away perspiration, Gabrielle mopped her face with an inelegant blue towel. Maybe it was that towel, but by the end you felt a lot better about the world. Until tonight. Box office: 020-7771 2000, then touring.",

      "body": "<p>Confirmation that many people in Britain work harder, faster and under more pressure than they did 10 or 20 years ago will come in a research paper later this week. </p> <p>The rise in the intensity of our work has been steeper than in any other country in Europe and much higher than in Germany, which saw the smallest rise out of 13 European states. </p> <p>The average British household with two adults was working seven hours a week more at the end of the 1990s than in the early 1980s, according to Francis Green, professor of economics at Kent University. </p> <p>Some 42% of workers felt strongly in 1997 that \"my job requires I work very hard\", compared with 40% in 1992. Work rates have intensified more for women than for men. </p> <p>But, despite a widespread belief, this is not due to job insecurity. The cause is partly a decline in trades union power in Britain. But it owes more to new technology, to organisational changes by management which speed up work tempo and to a \"call centre\" culture, which now employs 400,000 people. </p> <p>\"The call centre is the assembly-line of the modern era,\" says Prof Green, who also teaches at the centre for economic performance at the London School of Economics. He compares these centres to the high pressure, 24 hour car production lines at the start of the 20th century. </p> <p>Prof Green will give his findings in a lecture headed It's Been A Hard Day's Night - But Why? at Canterbury on Friday. They are based partly on his own research and partly on depth analysis of statistics in six other official workplace surveys over the last 20 years. </p> <p>He dismisses media commentaries which claim people are working harder out of fear for their jobs. </p> <p>\"Here is where rumour fares badly in its encounter with statistical reality\", says Prof Green, \"There has been a remarkable overall stability in the pattern of job tenure over the last three decades. </p> <p>\"The average man's job lasted about 10 years in the 1970s and about nine and a half years nowadays. Women's jobs last as long as they used to. </p> <p>\"The actual facts make common pronouncements about 'an end to jobs for life' seem like either misguided, or wishful, thinking.\" </p> <p>Moreover, unemployment is now lower and no evidence exists of increasing job loss fears. Both in 1986 and in 1997, some 84% of workers told surveys they saw little likelihood of unemployment. </p> <p>The explanation for media hype about insecurity is \"almost certainly\" that it is now more strongly felt by professional workers, who are close to the media and other sources. </p> <p>In 1997 just over two-thirds of professionals feared for their jobs, compared with only one-third in 1986. By contrast, among sales staff this worry dropped from nearly half to less than a third in the same period. \"Only when it hits the chattering classes does insecurity seem to become an issue for public discussion,\" notes the professor. </p> <p>On average, figures in all Prof Green's surveys show that the British working week has remained stable at around 37 hours for the last two decades. </p> <p>But \"the widespread sense of rising work pressure\" is linked to the fact that within this average more people of both sexes are working longer as well as shorter hours. </p> <p>In 1981, one person in six worked over 48 hours a week. By the end of the 1990s, this number rose to one in five. The cause of the seven-hour increase in two-adult households is partly because more wives now go out to work part time. </p> <p>Prof Green's graph of Europe shows a stronger, faster rise in work intensity in Britain than anywhere else in the 1990s. In Germany, one of our key competitors, there was virtually no rise. </p> <p>What lies behind this harder, faster work rate, he concludes, is the spread of management concepts, aiming to maximise the flow of work to workers. </p> <p>The extreme example of this is the call centre, where time spent on refreshment breaks is often deducted from pay. </p> <p>But many other companies, partly through making workers responsible for their own quality checks, have reduced \"interruptions where people could slack off a bit, reduce concentration and even have a break\". </p> <p>Emails and mobile phones have intensified use of working time and extended work out of hours. </p> <p>Suggestion schemes and consultation meetings encourage employees to find ways of working harder voluntarily.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Confirmation that many people in Britain work harder, faster and under more pressure than they did 10 or 20 years ago will come in a research paper later this week. The rise in the intensity of our work has been steeper than in any other country in Europe and much higher than in Germany, which saw the smallest rise out of 13 European states. The average British household with two adults was working seven hours a week more at the end of the 1990s than in the early 1980s, according to Francis Green, professor of economics at Kent University. Some 42% of workers felt strongly in 1997 that \"my job requires I work very hard\", compared with 40% in 1992. Work rates have intensified more for women than for men. But, despite a widespread belief, this is not due to job insecurity. The cause is partly a decline in trades union power in Britain. But it owes more to new technology, to organisational changes by management which speed up work tempo and to a \"call centre\" culture, which now employs 400,000 people. \"The call centre is the assembly-line of the modern era,\" says Prof Green, who also teaches at the centre for economic performance at the London School of Economics. He compares these centres to the high pressure, 24 hour car production lines at the start of the 20th century. Prof Green will give his findings in a lecture headed It's Been A Hard Day's Night - But Why? at Canterbury on Friday. They are based partly on his own research and partly on depth analysis of statistics in six other official workplace surveys over the last 20 years. He dismisses media commentaries which claim people are working harder out of fear for their jobs. \"Here is where rumour fares badly in its encounter with statistical reality\", says Prof Green, \"There has been a remarkable overall stability in the pattern of job tenure over the last three decades. \"The average man's job lasted about 10 years in the 1970s and about nine and a half years nowadays. Women's jobs last as long as they used to. \"The actual facts make common pronouncements about 'an end to jobs for life' seem like either misguided, or wishful, thinking.\" Moreover, unemployment is now lower and no evidence exists of increasing job loss fears. Both in 1986 and in 1997, some 84% of workers told surveys they saw little likelihood of unemployment. The explanation for media hype about insecurity is \"almost certainly\" that it is now more strongly felt by professional workers, who are close to the media and other sources. In 1997 just over two-thirds of professionals feared for their jobs, compared with only one-third in 1986. By contrast, among sales staff this worry dropped from nearly half to less than a third in the same period. \"Only when it hits the chattering classes does insecurity seem to become an issue for public discussion,\" notes the professor. On average, figures in all Prof Green's surveys show that the British working week has remained stable at around 37 hours for the last two decades. But \"the widespread sense of rising work pressure\" is linked to the fact that within this average more people of both sexes are working longer as well as shorter hours. In 1981, one person in six worked over 48 hours a week. By the end of the 1990s, this number rose to one in five. The cause of the seven-hour increase in two-adult households is partly because more wives now go out to work part time. Prof Green's graph of Europe shows a stronger, faster rise in work intensity in Britain than anywhere else in the 1990s. In Germany, one of our key competitors, there was virtually no rise. What lies behind this harder, faster work rate, he concludes, is the spread of management concepts, aiming to maximise the flow of work to workers. The extreme example of this is the call centre, where time spent on refreshment breaks is often deducted from pay. But many other companies, partly through making workers responsible for their own quality checks, have reduced \"interruptions where people could slack off a bit, reduce concentration and even have a break\". Emails and mobile phones have intensified use of working time and extended work out of hours. Suggestion schemes and consultation meetings encourage employees to find ways of working harder voluntarily.",

Naturally Del Piero, who has been Italy's coming man longer than Jamie Redknapp has been England's, wanted to start his first game at Euro 2000. But before hitting last night's winning goal he must have got the sniffles when he saw the company he was keeping. Italy's starting line-up last night bore no resemblance to the side that played in the previous two games here, which is the likely one to face England, assuming the latter do not lose to Romania and survive disqualification. There was no Demetrio Albertini or Stefano Fiore to provide sweet through-balls and no Filippo Inzaghi alongside to produce a dying swan im personation to earn a free-kick opportunity for Del Piero on the edge of the box. Instead, as a striking partner, he had to make do with Vincenzo Montella, who made his international debut only 12 months ago and who is most famous for celebrating goals by doing one of those rolling aeroplane salutes which English fans love doing to the Germans. We almost got a demonstration of it in the 18th minute when Montella broke into the box and, ignoring Del Piero's screams in the middle, went for goal and saw an excellent effort stopped by Magnus Hedman. Montella did provide a wonderful diagonal pass for his strike partner in the fifth minute but Del Piero gave it an almost petulant thump with his left foot and watched it go so high over the bar that Montella might have done his aeroplane impression by way of taking the mickey. Del Piero is apparently the highest paid player in the world, putting even Roy Keane and David Beckham in the Nationwide when it comes to the pay packet league.

Yes, things are starting to look pretty good for Italy who - ale-sodden yobs and ageing Romanian footballers permitting - will stand toe to toe with England in Brussels on Saturday night to contest a place in the tournament's last four. Sweden will head home feeling slightly aggrieved for they attacked gamely all night long and possibly deserved more than the Henrik Larsson goal 13 minutes from the end, which all-too-briefly was to ensure parity. Fine goal that it was, it was not even sufficient to snare a point for, as the game approached its final minute, Alessandro del Piero reminded us all of his rare gifts with a marvellous rising drive from the edge of the penalty area. The tired and aching limbs of the Swedes may have been pounding away but it was inevitable that their minds would wander, for their fate lay in the hands of others. With their best-laid plans largely undone by their failure to overcome Turkey at the same venue last Thursday, Sweden could do no more than chisel away at a traditionally impenetrable Italian defence in the hope that if things went well for them in Eindhoven, things would go badly for Belgium in Brussels. In truth, so much of Sweden's football in this tournament has been underpinned by anxiety and fear that the quality of their play in the opening quarter last night must have surprised even the most outlandish optimist in blue and yellow. Italian footballers have a lethargic air about them even when they are in a hurry so, having already claimed top spot in Group B, they were their usual selves - artistic, precise and, yes, infuriatingly lazy at times. But the days of footballing largesse are virtu ally over, and if the Swedes had been anticipating a helping hand from the Azzurri they will have been disappointed. The Italian coach Dino Zoff used the evening to blood his players who had previously been inactive, and there is no more enthusiastic a creature than one trying to impress its keeper. Zoff made eight changes to the line-up which overwhelmed Belgium; in came del Piero, Paolo Negro and Luigi di Biagio. That really is some second string. To their credit, Sweden showed unexpected spirit and had fortune smiled on them - as it did at times in their qualifying programme - they could have been three goals to the good inside 14 highly intriguing minutes. After Angelo di Livio had headed a Johan Mjallby effort off the line, both Yksel Osmanovski and Fredrik Ljungberg spurned marvellous openings, the latter missing dreadfully when scoring appeared to be the easier option. But Italy eventually settled and, with their opponents pursuing a policy of reckless ambition, they were hugely effective on the counterattack. England beware. Until his heroics at the death Del Piero had spent most of the evening providing for his partner, Vincenzo Montella, rather than pressing his claim for inclusion in the quarter-final. But Montella was wasteful with the ammunition, driving wide and then high when he should have done much better. It did not matter. Seven minutes before the interval Del Piero finally found someone capable of adding a cutting edge to one of his incisive passes, Di Biagio arriving almost unannounced to head in his corner. Italy promptly switched to cruise control, making light of the loss just before the interval of their captain Paolo Maldini, who was withdrawn as a precaution shortly after finding a carelessly-placed Swedish boot in his groin region. Sweden gamely shuffled their pack, showering the pitch with substitutes like confetti at a wedding. Their bravery paid off when Larsson found the net but the sweeter, more beguiling, football still came from the Italians.",

The Yorkshire club faxed an official offer to Parkhead yesterday and Viduka is expected at Elland Road before the weekend to discuss personal terms with the chairman Peter Ridsdale. \"We have had a written offer accepted by Celtic,\" said Ridsdale. \"The player is currently in Japan but we hope he will be with us in the next few days.\" The Leeds manager David O'Leary took advantage of being in the same Brussels hotel as his Celtic counterpart Martin O'Neill, on Euro 2000 duty with the BBC, to negotiate his second major transfer deal of the summer. He has already signed the French midfielder Olivier Dacourt for a club record \u00a37.2m and had an \u00a311m bid turned down for Manchester United's striker Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Chris Sutton is expected to replace Viduka at Celtic after Chelsea confirmed that they had accepted a \u00a36m offer for the striker. Chelsea have already accepted an offer of the same value from Middlesbrough and will leave it to Sutton to decide where he wishes to continue his career. Meanwhile, the Liverpool manager G\u00e9rard Houllier confidently expects to tempt Germany's Christian Ziege away from Middlesbrough once Euro 2000 is over. The Merseyside club made contact with Middlesbrough over the weekend with an offer of \u00a35m. Ziege joined Middlesbrough from Milan in a \u00a34m deal 12 months ago, but is believed to have already informed his manager at the Riverside, Bryan Robson, that he would like the opportunity to speak to Liverpool. Ziege would be the third high-profile German at Anfield following Dietmar Hamann, who signed from Newcastle United, and Markus Babbel, who will shortly join on a free transfer from Bayern Munich. However, Robson last night insisted that Ziege was going nowhere. \"He is not for sale and Liverpool do not have enough money to buy him,\" he said. \"There is no get-out clause in his contract which allows Ziege to talk to any club which shows interest in him.\"",

First they drank heavily and then they began swearing at the locals, singling out ethnic minorities for particularly vile abuse. When the police intervened there were running street battles, with chairs thrown, windows broken and bottles smashed. It is reasonable to assume that, on hearing the visitors were in Mansfield to watch their football team, the government of the day would be unimpressed. Promises that something would be done in future would probably not wash. Not only would the rowdy offenders be kicked out, their footballers would be told politely but firmly to go home. Swap Mansfield for Charleroi and you have a point fast being approached by England and the ullage among their travelling fans. Normally Lennart Johansson, the Swedish president of Uefa, has the lawyer's mastery of the non-committal statement but on Sunday night he was unequivocal: any more violence when England play Romania in Charleroi tonight and the team will be thrown out of Euro 2000, lock, stock and two smelly socks.

This, of course, is Johansson's point. Having suffered nearly 30 years, on and off, of bad English behaviour abroad Uefa is not about to condone another generation of violence. Some may feel that slinging England out would be giving in to the hooligans; it is an old response. But surely turning quiet towns into armed camps and causing considerable disruption to their routine activities merely because an international football is being played amounts to the same thing. True, this does not apply only to English supporters; the Germans, Dutch and Belgians have their own hooligan problems. Yet it is an established fact that when England do not qualify for a European Championship or a World Cup the atmosphere is infinitely more relaxed. The argument between those who would like to see potential troublemakers kept at home by the confiscation of their passports and others who see in this a denial of the basic liberty to travel unimpeded until an offence has been committed is as old as football hooliganism itself. For several days before England and Germany met in Charleroi on Saturday German security turned back hundreds of undesirables at the Belgian and Dutch frontiers. Small wonder, then, that Alain Courtois, the director of Euro 2000, asked how it was that so many rowdies were allowed to leave an island called Britain.

What the outside world saw and thought about it was one thing. For the England players, it was impossible to ignore the positive impact of their supporters.</p> <p>Their encouragement had given Keown the impetus he needed when, in the 58th minute, he raced over to the right-hand touchline to smother an attempted cross from Jens Jeremies and then, when the rebound fell at the feet of the German midfielder, stretched again to block the second attempt. Jeremies's head dropped. In that moment, five minutes after his side had taken the lead, Keown had told the Germans all they needed to know about their chances of breaching England's defence.</p> <p>One of the more thoughtful members of the squad, Keown was also its most effectively resolute player on a night to which resolution held the key. Yet although he was inspired by the crowd's incessant chanting, he had probably not spent too much time worrying about what those chants were saying.</p> <p>He was not on the pitch, for instance, during the preliminaries to the match, when thousands of England fans sang the Dambusters' March and mimed the action of planes on their way to bomb the Germans. In all probability, many of those indulging in a gleeful playground insult were the well-dressed middle-aged pro- fessional people of whom we have been hearing so much as commentators struggle to construct a typology of the modern English football fan.</p> <p>Nor was Kevin Keegan paying attention to the specific messages coming from the grandstands. A day later, he was uncomfortable enough when invited to make a general comment on the disturbances in Brussels and Charleroi during the hours before the match.</p> <p>\"I said what I wanted to say about it before we left England,\" he declared, \"when I said that I wanted the fans to come out and enjoy themselves in all the right ways.</p> <p>\"If you look at it just purely from our point of view in the stadium, it was everything you would want an England game to be. The atmosphere, the way they got behind us, things like that. The other things that have happened saddened me. I've said that before, and I'm not going to go down that road again, because I made it very clear how I felt about it before I came out.\"</p> <p>Then someone asked him how he responded to hearing the crowd sing \"No surrender to the IRA\", an anthem surely performed less in observance of its specific political message than out of a generalised desire to deliver the maximum cultural shock. \"I'm sorry,\" Keegan replied, evidently irritated, \"but I can't comment on something I didn't hear.\" His inquisitor gave a gesture of frustration. \"You can shrug your shoulders,\" the coach retorted. \"You may have heard it, but do expect me to take your word on that? I didn't hear it. I'm sorry.\"</p> <p>No one, including Keegan, to judge by his air of embarrassment, was impressed by this display of selective deafness. But what a position to be in. You go into the most important match of your life - certainly in the case of Keegan, who is old enough to remember the last significant defeat of Germany, 34 years earlier - with the focus that you have been refining for a year, a year in which you have been carefully tuning out all potentially disruptive signals. You need all the help you can get and the fans give it to you. Then you are expected to turn round and condemn them.</p> <p>Keegan's strategic refusal to accept the invitation said nothing about him as a man. He may have been brought up to revere Bill Shankly, but he knows that there is more to life than football. After the match, it had been a pleasure to hear the coach of England answer questions from a group of German journalists in their own language. This was a rare respite from the state-sponsored isolation to which we have been condemned by the insularity of our attitudes and the inadequacies of our education system, exemplified by the fact that out of the 16 referees controlling the matches at Euro 2000, only two - both of the British representatives - are monolinguists.</p> <p>Within the England camp, the reaction to the disruption caused by their supporters in the streets of Belgium is to blank it out. Something different is happening among the Italy squad, who may meet England in a quarter-final on Saturday night in the King Baudouin stadium in Brussels, built on the site of the old Heysel, where 34 Juventus fans and five Belgians died in 1985 as a consequence of English hooliganism. Italy's players placed wreaths under a memorial plaque before their match against Belgium in the stadium last week and, not unnaturally, they are preoccupied by the subtext of a meeting with Keegan's men.</p> <p>\"There's a week in which to try and calm things down,\" Gianluca Pessotto, a current Juventus player, said at the weekend. \"Maybe Uefa's warning [of expulsion] will help. And there's nothing to say that England will definitely get the result they need against Romania. But the coincidence of playing the English in Brussels is bound to raise the emotional temperature of the game.\" Many of his team-mates are saying that they do not want their families and friends to attend the match, if it takes place.</p> <p>Meanwhile Keegan's players will probably continue to close their ears and eyes when they return to Charleroi tonight. What else can they do? Even professional observers are nowhere near unanimity on the causes, the effects or the solutions.</p> <p>And at this stage, anecdotal evidence is virtually worthless. One man travels from Brussels to Charleroi on a train with English fans and calls it one of the worst experiences of his life, having been forced to listen to songs about gassing the Germans.

Belgium were always vulnerable to the counter-attack and so it was in the 69th minute. Suat Kaya streaked away on the right and angled a low pass for Sukur to score from close range. De Wilde, crowning a personal nightmare, was sent off in the 84th minute after rushing out from his area and lunging wildly at Arif.",

As a result, Martin Keown was constantly exhorting the back line to push out.</p> <p>Up front, too, possession was difficult to keep. Passes played up to Alan Shearer and Michael Owen invariably found the strikers heavily marked and with no immediate forward support from a midfield programmed to hold rather than probe.</p> <p>\"We definitely need to start passing the ball better,\" admitted Keegan on Sunday. \"We pass it well in training, we just need to do it on the pitch.\" England have done it on the pitch already in this tournament, in the first 20 minutes against Portugal.

And when it was inventive, the man in possession invariably failed to spot the option or took so long controlling the ball that the destructive value of an early pass was lost. Ideally a player should be aware of what is going on around him and where he might pass the ball before he even gains possession. This is akin to playing chess thinking one move ahead. But England struggle to master even this gambit, especially at the back where the aim of too many clearances against Germany was to get the ball out the area rather than find a team-mate as well. All this wasted possession simply invited Germany back on to England, prompting the defence to drop deeper, searching for what the England coach Les Reed calls \"the comfort zone that comes with knowing there is no space behind you\". As a result, Martin Keown was constantly exhorting the back line to push out. Up front, too, possession was difficult to keep. Passes played up to Alan Shearer and Michael Owen invariably found the strikers heavily marked and with no immediate forward support from a midfield programmed to hold rather than probe. \"We definitely need to start passing the ball better,\" admitted Keegan on Sunday. \"We pass it well in training, we just need to do it on the pitch.\" England have done it on the pitch already in this tournament, in the first 20 minutes against Portugal. Now they need to repeat that virtuosity against Romania while retaining the solidity of the Germany match. Thankfully England need only a draw to qualify for the quarter-finals, though Paul Ince insists: \"You know the English mentality. We never play for a draw.\" Either way, it must be hoped that Keegan the cement mixer has sorted out the right ingredients.",

Subs: Belodedici, Ciobotariu, Ganea, Hildan, Lincar, Lobont, Lupescu, Petre, Prunea, Rosu. 1 England kick-off needing only a point to be sure of reaching the quarter-finals. Surprisingly there is no customary punt upfield and England opt for some early passing moves before giving away possession. 3 Romania win a free-kick right on the edge of the area after Mutu is allowed through form midfield. Ilie takes and forces Martyn to make a great save diving to his left. Early let-off for Engalnd. 4 First cross from Beckham on the right, but there is no one there to meet it. 5 Romania push up again with Mutu on the left; the ball is spread wide to Contra on the right before Ilie fails to connect with the cross. 7 England free-kick. Wise sprays it wide to G Neville on the right, Romania clear and break upfield before losing possession for a goal-kick. 8 Munteanu has a crack from 25 yards but his effort is well wide of the left-hand upright. 10 England start to knock it around on the right after a lively start by Romania. Beckham fires a cross into space. 13 Ilie makes an early run onto a through-ball from deep but it runs ahead of him. 14 Romania corner, Contra takes, Keown mis-kicks but England still manage to clear. Romania still looking the more lively. 15 Petrescu does well to play in Moldovan on the edge of the area, but his shot is straight at Martyn. 16 Owen gets round the back of Filipescu on the edge of the six-yard box to meet a long throw, but he can only direct his shot into the stands. 18 Booking Chivu after he upended Beckham just when England wrer passing well. Free-kick on the right corner of the area. Beckham takes, but no one can reach the ball as it flies across goal. Sol Campbell the nearest. 20 Owen turns well to get away from his marker but his touch is too strong. Encouraging movement from the England striker. 21 Romania corner on the Romanian right. 22 GOAL! Romania 1 - 0 England From the corner, the ball goes out to Chivu on the left and his cross to Moldovan at the far post instead bounces into the goal off the upright. 25 Wise blows a shooting chance form 20 yards when his first touch lets him down and he shoots wide. 27 Owen fails to use a lovely pass from Beckham, more out of surprise that Beckham managed to find the angle. 29 England push up and knock the ball around the edge of the area but no onemanages to get in a shot. 32 Substitution Belodedici on for Popescu after Popescu injures himself trying to injure Beckham. 34 Ilie gets behind Keown and on to the end of a cross by Petrescu; no offside, but Ilie's header is straight at Martyn. 36 Chivu races away on the left, gets past G Neville and shoots from 20 yards, but luckily for England it flies over. England being comprehensively out-numbered and out-played in midfield much in the smae way as they were in the second half against Portugal. 38 England corner after Scholes just fails to meet a Beckham cross. It is cleared, pumped back in and cleared again for a goal-kick. 40 Booking Petrescu 41 Penalty: Romania 1 - 1 England Ince is brought down just as he was about to shoot with his left foot. Shearer takes to Stelea's right and puts England back on level terms. 44 England fans in full voice now after a pretty ropey start from Keegan's men. Great work by Ince ends in a free-kick to the left of the area. Contra earns himself a booking in the process. Romania clear from the corner. 45 Booking Ilie, for trying to get a penalty when under pressure form Martyn. GOAL! Scholes knocks the ball over the top to send Owen away, he rides the challenge of 'keeper Stelea, prods the ball past and his pace sees him to the far post to cut back for the goal. Half-time. Romania on top for most of the half, but England have used the evident spirit in the side to pull back and take the lead. 46 Romania kick-off the second half with England fans singing the national anthem. 47 Romania corner, played short, cleared for a throw. Romania knock it back in, but England clear. 48 GOAL! Romania 2 - 2 England England all over the place at the back. Martyn comes out to punch clear what shouild have been handled by a central defender before Munteanu fires in from just inside the area. 51 England free-kick. Beckham floats in from deep but Shearer is penalised trying to help the ball on to Scholes. 55 Quick passing by England on the left almost sees Owen away on a run but his first touch is too heavy. 57 Wise finds Beckham wide on the right, his cross is played behind Owen in the direction of Scholes, but Romania get there first. 59 Romania attack the England goal again with a succession of crosses from Ilie on the right. Offside eventually given. 60 Beckham cross towards Shearer in the six-yard box but Stelea gets there first. 61 Ilie tries a weak shot from close range but it is easy for Martyn. England living dangerously. 64 Booking Shearer for diving. And he did. 66 Galca tries a long-range shot but sends it into the crowd. 67 Substitution Heskey on for Owen. 68 Substitution Rosu on for Galca. 69 Heskey unlucky not to reach a Beckham cross, Belodedici heads clear. 70 Petrescu shoots from 30 yards; he keeps it down but Martyn is behind it. 71 Booking Filipescu, after felling Heskey just as he was setting off on a run. 74 Ilie waltzs into the penalty area, Keown blocks and then clears the rebound. Substitution: Galea on for Ilie. 75 Substitution Barmby on for Wise. 77 Mutu's shot forces Martyn to the ground to save as Moldovan races in for the rebound. 79 Scholes finds Barmby on the left, he finds Heskey for a one-two but his shot goes well wide. 81 Substitution Southgate on for Scholes, signalling a change of tactics for England as they seek to hang on to what they have got. 84 Romania corner. England clear and break with Shearer and Heskey. Munteanu tackles for a throw. 88 Penalty Romania 3 - 2 England Nightmare! Moldovan is brought down by P Neville and Ganea puts it past Martyn with ease. 90 England throw near the corner flag, Romania clear. England frantic now and win a free-kick on the left. Beckham takes and tries to find Shearer but he misses it and Stelea gets there first. Full-time. Romania 3 - 2 England England are out.",

This article focuses on shorter courses and provides some guidance to help you answer these questions.</p> <p>The sort of course you choose depends on what your intentions are. The vast majority of postgraduates are not locked away in some mythical ivory tower doing pure research leading to a PhD or DPhil. They are studying shorter masters courses and diplomas, which are often intended to provide a specific training. These can be directly related to your previous undergraduate degree, to give you more detailed and advanced knowledge of the subject.</p> <p>Alternatively, they can enable you to retrain in a new area or develop skills and knowledge relevant to your work or career. Diploma courses usually last six to nine months and masters courses may last one or two years.</p> <p>Before you consider doing a postgraduate course you must ask yourself why you want to do it. And, more importantly, you must answer yourself honestly.</p> <p>Courses may be entirely taught (PG Dip), have a small research element (MA and MSc), act as a training in research techniques (MRes) or be pure research (MPhil). Most shorter postgraduate courses provide a training for work and some are aimed at equipping you for further study or research.</p> <p>There are many different reasons why you might want to study at postgraduate level, but the three main categories people fall into are academic, vocational and drifting.</p> <p>Academic reasons are often the most obvious for continuing in or returning to higher education. You may have developed a keen interest in a particular subject and want to advance your knowledge. This can be for career reasons leading to work in a university, or it may simply be that you want to extend your learning and expand your knowledge for pleasure. You can, of course, do both.</p> <p>Vocational factors are often easier to identify where a course and qualification provides specific career benefits. For example, diplomas in social work, counselling or law all provide clear career benefits and training. Masters courses also may be explicitly vocational and can provide a fast route to enhancing your previous qualifications and giving you an advantage in the job market. Examples include an MA in town and country planning and the MSc in transport engineering.</p> <p>Drifting is unfortunately a common reason for people doing postgraduate courses, and can often lead to a bad experience. You may feel that doing a postgraduate course is a \"natural\" progression from an undergraduate degree. You may find yourself doing a course because of general inertia, indecision or the desire to postpone other decisions.</p> <p>So it is crucial that you identify what your motivations are so that you can get the best out of your course. Masters courses (and diplomas) are intensive, rewarding and often provide clear career benefits. </p> <p>They can also be stressful, demanding and frustrating. If you are not sure what you want to get out of your course it can make your life very difficult.</p> <p>It is important to choose carefully.

But don't be misled, these are commercial loans for courses which offer career benefits or training and can be limited to the legal or health care professions. </p> <p>The repayments are not linked to salary and start one or two months after the course finishes. Fees also vary dramatically with no standard level. The Department for Education and Employment (DfEE) sets a recommended rate each year (\u00a32,740 for 2000-2001 for students from within the EU) but many courses cost considerably more than this. For example, MBA courses can cost \u00a310,000 or more. Ask about funding when contacting departments and check with a university careers service for information on charitable sources, trusts and scholarships. </p> <p>Make sure that you also find out about any additional fees you might need to pay on top of the base rate for the university.

It can be too easy to focus on the different settings for work with young people - the club, the college, the streets - and on the content or curriculum of what's on offer,\" he says. </p> <p>\"Clarity of purpose and relevant content are important. But what will make this work are the values and skills of those engaged with young people, regardless of the setting or service in which they're operating.\" </p> <p>If the Connexions service is to get beyond cerebral concept and really make a difference, then it has to be designed to meet young peoples' needs, rather than what politicians or even education professionals imagine they need, Wylie adds. </p> <p>Even then it may not go far enough. After all, you could talk to Kevin three times a week for three years. But all the expert advice given would be wasted if, at the end of the day, there still were no adequate services around to keep him occupied or, indeed, catering for his \"holistic\" development. </p> <p>\"There's a danger too,\" Wylie warns, \"of the partnership process being more about the practicalities of bringing diverse parties to the table to find an accommodation, than about a radical new service.\" </p> <p>Many government departments are involved in Connexions, yet some may not easily give up their sole control over different parts of present youth sector provision. Certainly the history of Whitehall collaboration is not a trouble-free zone. </p> <p>Of course, Britain's scouting movement will continue to swear allegiance to the Queen.

The school is in a working-class area, and she is dedicated to ensuring pupils enjoy drama, believing it key in helping them to \"glow and grow\", as her principal said. \u0095 Five of last year's national awards winners received OBEs in Saturday's birthday honours list: Barbara \"Paddy\" Beels of Wingate Nursery School, County Durham; Elizabeth Seddon of Elmtree First School, Chesham, Bucks; Jean Heslop of Cliffe Hill School, Halifax; Keith Parry, of Hyde Technology School, Cheshire and Wendy Crockett of Alderman Blaxill School, Colchester.",

      "body": "<p>Parents who are sending children off to university this autumn are likely to have drummed in warnings about safe sex, spiked drinks and careful management of student grants. What few tell their young adult offspring is to beware the friendly fellow student who approaches them in the corridor to talk about Bible study groups, or hands out leaflets on world peace. </p> <p>Yet these are the kind of techniques favoured by the fringe religious and esoteric groups whose numbers appear to be mushrooming in tandem with the expansion in higher education. As one university chaplain put it: \"Any campus now is a bazaar with different groups screaming for the minds and hearts of everybody.\" </p> <p>While some movements are harmless or benign, others exert heavy psychological pressure to divert students into a life of fundraising and recruiting for the cause. Sarah Cope-Faulkner, now 30, was recruited to an evangelical Christian group by a fellow student who was \"very friendly, very open, always wanting to spend time with me\". </p> <p>Then a second-year student of business and economics at Wolverhampton University, Cope-Faulkner describes herself as from a typical \"non-religious C of E background\". But under the influence of her new friend she quickly progressed through a series of bible studies and meetings to \"repentance\", baptism and full membership of the church. </p> <p>\"You joined when you were baptised, and your duties were recruiting, giving 10 per cent of your income and 'love gifts', and attending meetings,\" she says. \"You were made to feel you had to do these things or God wouldn't love you.\" </p> <p>Sarah dropped her old friends, became distant from her family - \"they said I shouldn't visit because I wasn't spiritual enough to be in that sinful environment\" - and increasingly withdrew from university life. </p> <p>\"I attempted to carry on with my studies, but my marks were getting lower and lower because in thought you were never away from it. None of my tutors knew me well enough to have any idea what was happening.\" </p> <p>She broke away from the International Church of Christ after 15 months, \u00a31,500 the poorer, had a nervous breakdown and left college without taking her finals. </p> <p>\"It took me a year to begin to function properly and to come off anti-depressants,\" she says. \"It was a form of mental rape. They got inside my head and it is very difficult to get them out again.\" The Cult Information Centre, run by former cult member Ian Haworth, stresses that students are prime targets for cults. \"The likely candidate for cult membership is someone of average to above-average intelligence, well-educated, idealistic and intellectually alert,\" he says. \"University campuses are saturated with people like that - smart people, who care.\" </p> <p>The problem, he says, is that students don't see themselves as cult recruitment material. \"If you turn up and give a lecture on cult awareness,\" he says, \"students don't show. Because they assume, wrongly, that people join cults rather than being recruited, and that they join because they're vulnerable, because there's a problem.\"</p> <p>The International Church of Christ (known also as the London Church of Christ, Birmingham Church of Christ etc) makes no secret of the interest undergraduates hold for them. In a 1990 publication Shining Like Stars, campus ministry is described as \"the goose that laid the golden egg\" and student recruiters are urged to \"set personal goals of between 10-20 new acquaintances each day\": \"Take special note of those who seem open and try to see them daily. The key is not spending a lot of time with them but making the time you do spend exciting. In general, 30 minutes or less is sufficient.\" </p> <p>Once contact has been made, ICC members are persistent. One student who recently attended a Sunday meeting in north London already had two messages from the group on her mobile phone by the time she got off the underground on her way home. </p> <p>In 1998 chaplains at Cardiff University issued a strongly worded warning to students about ICC practices and methods. Paul Overend, Anglican chaplain at Cardiff, says: \"We all find meaningful paradigms by which to live and if that's not abusing us, fine. But we can sometimes be offering too much freedom in order to be loved, and students are very vulnerable to that.\" The ICC were banned at the University of Birmingham ten years ago. </p> <p>\"They were recruiting aggressively on campus and interfering with students as they went about their business,\" said a spokesperson. \"Once recruited, students were subjected to intense pressure, which interfered with their studies.\" </p> <p>But some people in higher education now believe that attempts to ban groups are ineffectual. Some have been intimidated by threats of legal action; others fear that cults have abandoned a stall at the Freshers Fair for the more sophisticated and harder-to-police tactic of student plants in halls of residence. </p> <p>With 50,000 students in the city, Leeds is a good hunting ground. \"It's certainly a matter of concern,\" says Leeds University chaplain Simon Robinson. \"We've had a number of new religious movements recruiting just off campus. There is no policy of banning but a strong policy of raising levels of awareness about the potential difficulties of joining such groups.\" </p> <p>Inform, a government-funded charity providing information on new religious movements, have more than 2,000 groups in their database, ranging from large international organisations such as the Scientologists to individuals with a handful of followers. \"Clearly there are groups that focus specifically on university students,\" says information officer Amanda Van Eck. \"Often students have no responsibilities, so it is much easier for them to drastically change their lives around. And they're young and energetic, so if the group is looking for missionaries, students are going to be popular.\" </p> <p>\"I supply university chaplains with leaflets on movements including the School of Economic Science, Rajneeshism (now called Osho) and the Jesus Fellowship.\" The University Bible Fellowship is a name that crops up regularly in relation to student recruitment, as is the Unification Church - and the ubiquitous International Church of Christ. </p> <p>Questions about what constitutes a cult and what a new religious movement, what is exploitative and what a matter of individual choice, are crystallised around young adults' membership of sects and belief groups. Stephen Williams, senior Anglican chaplain to universities in the diocese of London, takes a dispassionate view, telling parents not to be alarmed when they come to him with concerns about the group their son or daughter has joined. </p> <p>\"It's an exploration, finding oneself and one's purpose, a relationship with God, and not in itself a bad thing,\" he says. \"Most use this as an entry point into some sort of belief system and don't get stuck.\" When young people do get stuck in manipulative and isolating groups, the results can be agonising for their families. One parent who had an adult child in a cult described it as 'like a hostage situation'. </p> <p>\"Parents are very, very vulnerable,\" he says. \"My son was with the Unification Church for nine months but it seemed like nine years. We put on a tremendous amount of pressure and he was eventually sent home to pacify us.\" Another parent, whose student daughter was recruited over a year ago and has not been in direct contact since, says it is 'a living bereavement'. For those concerned about NRM activity on campus, there is little they can do. Student union bodies may choose not to recognise organisations on the grounds of equal opportunities, but there is a presumption in favour of free speech on campus which militates against banning organisations. </p> <p>Some who have tried to initiate bans on letting premises to unwelcome organisations have been threatened with legal action; many cult-like groups are litigious and rich enough to pursue court action. \"Every cult in creation can come and set up in a UK university without let or hindrance,\" said one university chaplain. \"And for students, who increasingly tend to be spiritually ignorant, confronted at 19 by different religious pundits they have no way of assessing what is mainstream and what is a wacky and way-out cult.\"</p> <p><strong>'The need to study was no excuse'</strong></p> <p>Student <strong>Sally Eyden 22</strong>, attended a recent meeting of the International Church of Christ in London.</p> <p>\"The North London sector of the ICC uses the facilities of South Camden Community College for its Sunday services - they have a separate service for students. There were about 50 people there, all young, all dashing about greeting each other and giving each other these sideways hugs. They all speak in the same way, using this pseudo-American drawl and using the word 'awesome' a lot. </p> <p>\"It wasn't your traditional church service at all. It was very jolly with tea and coffee and nibbles being passed around, and when people in the audience were moved by something they'd call out 'preach it' to the person giving the talk. It was more like a team-building exercise than a religious event. </p> <p>\"Everyone seemed incredibly happy and alert. But these are not ordinary students. No one smokes, gets drunk or has sex before marriage; people are even discouraged from kissing. One girl told me she wouldn't kiss her boyfriend until they were at the altar: Well, we all know where kissing leads to - immoral thoughts and then weakness [sex],' she said. </p> <p>\"The preacher filled his sermon with references to 'being fruitful' - going out and recruiting new members to the church. The service was specially tailored to students: they were saying that the need to study was no excuse, you still had to come and worship, that God comes first and that Christ died for you. </p> <p>\"They talked about one particular guy there, how he had a new recruit who hadn't turned up for bible study because he had an exam the next day, and how this guy had gone round to his house to do the bible study there, till 11 pm. That was considered very good.\" </p> <p>\"I felt uncomfortable and self-conscious. Everybody seemed to know my name, although I'd only told it to a couple of people. I returned home emotionally and physically drained and found I already had two messages from members.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Parents who are sending children off to university this autumn are likely to have drummed in warnings about safe sex, spiked drinks and careful management of student grants. What few tell their young adult offspring is to beware the friendly fellow student who approaches them in the corridor to talk about Bible study groups, or hands out leaflets on world peace. Yet these are the kind of techniques favoured by the fringe religious and esoteric groups whose numbers appear to be mushrooming in tandem with the expansion in higher education. As one university chaplain put it: \"Any campus now is a bazaar with different groups screaming for the minds and hearts of everybody.\" While some movements are harmless or benign, others exert heavy psychological pressure to divert students into a life of fundraising and recruiting for the cause. Sarah Cope-Faulkner, now 30, was recruited to an evangelical Christian group by a fellow student who was \"very friendly, very open, always wanting to spend time with me\". Then a second-year student of business and economics at Wolverhampton University, Cope-Faulkner describes herself as from a typical \"non-religious C of E background\". But under the influence of her new friend she quickly progressed through a series of bible studies and meetings to \"repentance\", baptism and full membership of the church. \"You joined when you were baptised, and your duties were recruiting, giving 10 per cent of your income and 'love gifts', and attending meetings,\" she says. \"You were made to feel you had to do these things or God wouldn't love you.\" Sarah dropped her old friends, became distant from her family - \"they said I shouldn't visit because I wasn't spiritual enough to be in that sinful environment\" - and increasingly withdrew from university life. \"I attempted to carry on with my studies, but my marks were getting lower and lower because in thought you were never away from it. None of my tutors knew me well enough to have any idea what was happening.\" She broke away from the International Church of Christ after 15 months, \u00a31,500 the poorer, had a nervous breakdown and left college without taking her finals. \"It took me a year to begin to function properly and to come off anti-depressants,\" she says. \"It was a form of mental rape. They got inside my head and it is very difficult to get them out again.\" The Cult Information Centre, run by former cult member Ian Haworth, stresses that students are prime targets for cults. \"The likely candidate for cult membership is someone of average to above-average intelligence, well-educated, idealistic and intellectually alert,\" he says. \"University campuses are saturated with people like that - smart people, who care.\" The problem, he says, is that students don't see themselves as cult recruitment material. \"If you turn up and give a lecture on cult awareness,\" he says, \"students don't show. Because they assume, wrongly, that people join cults rather than being recruited, and that they join because they're vulnerable, because there's a problem.\" The International Church of Christ (known also as the London Church of Christ, Birmingham Church of Christ etc) makes no secret of the interest undergraduates hold for them. In a 1990 publication Shining Like Stars, campus ministry is described as \"the goose that laid the golden egg\" and student recruiters are urged to \"set personal goals of between 10-20 new acquaintances each day\": \"Take special note of those who seem open and try to see them daily. The key is not spending a lot of time with them but making the time you do spend exciting. In general, 30 minutes or less is sufficient.\" Once contact has been made, ICC members are persistent. One student who recently attended a Sunday meeting in north London already had two messages from the group on her mobile phone by the time she got off the underground on her way home. In 1998 chaplains at Cardiff University issued a strongly worded warning to students about ICC practices and methods. Paul Overend, Anglican chaplain at Cardiff, says: \"We all find meaningful paradigms by which to live and if that's not abusing us, fine. But we can sometimes be offering too much freedom in order to be loved, and students are very vulnerable to that.\" The ICC were banned at the University of Birmingham ten years ago. \"They were recruiting aggressively on campus and interfering with students as they went about their business,\" said a spokesperson. \"Once recruited, students were subjected to intense pressure, which interfered with their studies.\" But some people in higher education now believe that attempts to ban groups are ineffectual. Some have been intimidated by threats of legal action; others fear that cults have abandoned a stall at the Freshers Fair for the more sophisticated and harder-to-police tactic of student plants in halls of residence. With 50,000 students in the city, Leeds is a good hunting ground. \"It's certainly a matter of concern,\" says Leeds University chaplain Simon Robinson. \"We've had a number of new religious movements recruiting just off campus. There is no policy of banning but a strong policy of raising levels of awareness about the potential difficulties of joining such groups.\" Inform, a government-funded charity providing information on new religious movements, have more than 2,000 groups in their database, ranging from large international organisations such as the Scientologists to individuals with a handful of followers. \"Clearly there are groups that focus specifically on university students,\" says information officer Amanda Van Eck. \"Often students have no responsibilities, so it is much easier for them to drastically change their lives around. And they're young and energetic, so if the group is looking for missionaries, students are going to be popular.\" \"I supply university chaplains with leaflets on movements including the School of Economic Science, Rajneeshism (now called Osho) and the Jesus Fellowship.\" The University Bible Fellowship is a name that crops up regularly in relation to student recruitment, as is the Unification Church - and the ubiquitous International Church of Christ. Questions about what constitutes a cult and what a new religious movement, what is exploitative and what a matter of individual choice, are crystallised around young adults' membership of sects and belief groups. Stephen Williams, senior Anglican chaplain to universities in the diocese of London, takes a dispassionate view, telling parents not to be alarmed when they come to him with concerns about the group their son or daughter has joined. \"It's an exploration, finding oneself and one's purpose, a relationship with God, and not in itself a bad thing,\" he says. \"Most use this as an entry point into some sort of belief system and don't get stuck.\" When young people do get stuck in manipulative and isolating groups, the results can be agonising for their families. One parent who had an adult child in a cult described it as 'like a hostage situation'. \"Parents are very, very vulnerable,\" he says. \"My son was with the Unification Church for nine months but it seemed like nine years. We put on a tremendous amount of pressure and he was eventually sent home to pacify us.\" Another parent, whose student daughter was recruited over a year ago and has not been in direct contact since, says it is 'a living bereavement'. For those concerned about NRM activity on campus, there is little they can do. Student union bodies may choose not to recognise organisations on the grounds of equal opportunities, but there is a presumption in favour of free speech on campus which militates against banning organisations. Some who have tried to initiate bans on letting premises to unwelcome organisations have been threatened with legal action; many cult-like groups are litigious and rich enough to pursue court action. \"Every cult in creation can come and set up in a UK university without let or hindrance,\" said one university chaplain. \"And for students, who increasingly tend to be spiritually ignorant, confronted at 19 by different religious pundits they have no way of assessing what is mainstream and what is a wacky and way-out cult.\" 'The need to study was no excuse' Student Sally Eyden 22, attended a recent meeting of the International Church of Christ in London. \"The North London sector of the ICC uses the facilities of South Camden Community College for its Sunday services - they have a separate service for students. There were about 50 people there, all young, all dashing about greeting each other and giving each other these sideways hugs. They all speak in the same way, using this pseudo-American drawl and using the word 'awesome' a lot. \"It wasn't your traditional church service at all. It was very jolly with tea and coffee and nibbles being passed around, and when people in the audience were moved by something they'd call out 'preach it' to the person giving the talk. It was more like a team-building exercise than a religious event. \"Everyone seemed incredibly happy and alert. But these are not ordinary students. No one smokes, gets drunk or has sex before marriage; people are even discouraged from kissing. One girl told me she wouldn't kiss her boyfriend until they were at the altar: Well, we all know where kissing leads to - immoral thoughts and then weakness [sex],' she said. \"The preacher filled his sermon with references to 'being fruitful' - going out and recruiting new members to the church. The service was specially tailored to students: they were saying that the need to study was no excuse, you still had to come and worship, that God comes first and that Christ died for you. \"They talked about one particular guy there, how he had a new recruit who hadn't turned up for bible study because he had an exam the next day, and how this guy had gone round to his house to do the bible study there, till 11 pm. That was considered very good.\" \"I felt uncomfortable and self-conscious. Everybody seemed to know my name, although I'd only told it to a couple of people. I returned home emotionally and physically drained and found I already had two messages from members.\"",

      "bodyText": "Detectives investigating the racist murder of a black clubber were yesterday granted an extra 36 hours to question three soldiers they are treating as their prime suspects. Glyne Agard, 34, was kicked and beaten to death outside a nightclub in Westbury, Wiltshireon, on Sunday morning. North Wiltshire magistrates court granted police the extra time to question the three soldiers from the Green Howards, based at Battlesbury barracks, Warminster. The three are in their late teens to early twenties. Officers have also arrested a 17-year-old girl from Trowbridge on suspicion of murder, who they were questioning yesterday. A fourth soldier, who was black, was released without charge. Mr Agard, from Reading, had gone to Westbury for a night out with his brother Stephen, 32, who was treated in the Royal United hospital, Bath, for head, neck and chest injuries. A third friend, Gary Belgrave, who was attacked, was released from hospital on Sunday after suffering concussion. Wiltshire police described the incident as a \"racially motivated, brutal and unprovoked attack\". Mr Agard's girlfriend, Lisa Andrews, yesterday spoke of her grief: \"We had been together eight years and were the best of friends. I loved him so much. Glyne was such a good person, quiet, helpful and generous. He would never hurt anyone.\" Ms Andrews told of her last evening with Mr Agard, a train ticket collector. He was watching the England v Germany match on television. \"He had watched about 20 minutes of it before he was asked if he wanted to go out. Glyne wanted to stay in, but he never likes saying no to people. He agreed to go out and I think it was to please Stephen and Gary. He didn't really go to nightclubs. When he left he said 'I will see you later, take care'. The next time I saw him he was dead.\"",

      "body": "<p>The gangs who organise Chinese illegal migration are believed to have targeted western Europe in greater numbers after a recent clampdown in Canada and the US. The 58 who died on their way to Dover may have been assured that Britain was a safer destination.</p> <p>Experts in illegal emigration from China said last night that it was much harder to control the land and air routes to Europe than those across the oceans to north America. \"They can go in any direction,\" said a senior security official in Hong Kong. \"The old route was via Russia or one of the former Soviet bloc states. But many now fly directly to a west European capital and then move on.</p> <p>\"We know a lot about the snakeheads who control the boats going across to Canada and the US from the south China coast. But, increasingly, Chinese migrants are just taking the train to Moscow, or getting a tourist visa for Austria or Greece.\"</p> <p>The smugglers have been known as snakeheads for many years: their clients are described as \"human snakes\".</p> <p>A group that arrives in England is unlikely to have travelled en masse from China. \"They may or may not know one another already,\" said the security official, \"but they will only assemble at the last stage of the journey.\"</p> <p><b>Triads</b></p> <p>A small number of migrants flee for political reasons, fearing that they will be detained, often without trial, because of association with an illegal protest group or with a religious cult such as the banned Falungong.</p> <p>But the great majority are economic migrants from south China, particularly the coastal provinces of Guangdong, Fujian and Zhejiang. The outward flow of Chinese workers began more than 150 years ago and is taken for granted in the region.</p> <p>The snakeheads place public advertisements with the slogan \"overseas labourers wanted\", often on city walls or lamp-posts or outside local factories.</p> <p>Would-be migrants may pay up to $30,000 (\u00a320,400) for the snakeheads' service. In many cases they can only afford a deposit, and must agree to pay off the rest when they find employment abroad. Women who fall into debt may be forced into prostitution.</p> <p>Chinese snakehead gangs have close connections with western-based triads which originate in the southern provinces.</p> <p>Chinese illegal migrants often travel with passports issued by other Asian countries, such as Malaysia or Thailand, obtained illegally by the snakeheads. They may not need a visa to enter their first European stopping place. Or they will travel with an \"invitation letter\" written, for a price, by a citizen of the destination country.</p> <p>A typical route might be by train to Hungary or Poland, then on foot or by car into Austria or Germany and on to France or the Netherlands. Another route might be by air to Turkey or Greece, then by train though Austria to Italy. A third route is by air to Thailand or Malaysia where bogus documents are collected, then to Moscow and on to Prague or Bucharest.</p> <p>Direct air travel has become more popular than the long train journey via Russia, which requires more frontiers to be crossed. With the growth of tourism abroad, Chinese travellers have become less of a rarity.</p> <p>A Beijing airport border inspector was jailed yesterday, according to a human rights group, for helping a Chinese national leave the country with false documents. The Hong Kong-based information centre for human rights and democracy claimed that more than 3,000 people trying to leave illegally were stopped at Beijing airport last year.</p> <p>The economic migrants usually come from Chinese towns rather than the countryside, and possess enough funds to pay at least a deposit to the snakeheads. They are not living in desperate poverty but seek a better life. They may include doctors, musicians, clerks and teachers as well as unskilled workers.</p> <p>Some will have a relative abroad who has painted an attractive picture of the opportunities available. Britain already has a large, well-established population of legal Chinese migrants from Guangdong, the province that borders Hong Kong, and to a lesser extent from Fujian.</p> <p>Some illegal migrants have been apprehended after travelling long distances by air. South Africa and some South American countries have been used as the first stepping stone.</p> <p>The traffic began to attract western attention in the early 1990s. The German border guards directorate concluded in 1993 that the smugglers were adept at evading controls and possessed sufficient funds to bribe frontier officials.</p> <p>The Chinese government is fully aware of the negative publicity aroused by recent boat arrivals in north America and has taken more energetic steps to stop the traffic. Government publicity in the coastal provinces warns those who are tempted that they may face deportation if they arrive, or death on the way.</p> <p>China's public security ministry says that more than 9,000 stowaways and more than 900 snakeheads were arrested last year by border police. In January, the ministry called for \"a tighter crackdown on crimes in border and coastal areas\" involving smuggling of people. These were \"detrimental to the country's stability and national interest\" and had damaged China's reputation abroad.</p> <p>Also in January the United States deported 246 stowaways back to Fujian province in an effort to stem the flow.</p> <p><b>Trapped</b></p> <p>In the wake of closer US and Chinese cooperation, experts believe that would-be Chinese migrants and asylum seekers are increasingly shifting to European destinations. Many are deceived by illegal operators who claim that entry into an EU country is easier and that asylum is guaranteed on arrival.</p> <p>Land and air travel is regarded as less dangerous than passage in the containers crossing the Pacific where the migrants are trapped for more than a week in foul air and darkened boxes.</p> <p>Tragically the 58 who died on the way to Dover would have thought that their ordeal would be safe and short. Their fate is likely to be widely reported in the Chinese press, which is now less inhibited than it used to be about reporting national disasters.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The gangs who organise Chinese illegal migration are believed to have targeted western Europe in greater numbers after a recent clampdown in Canada and the US. The 58 who died on their way to Dover may have been assured that Britain was a safer destination. Experts in illegal emigration from China said last night that it was much harder to control the land and air routes to Europe than those across the oceans to north America. \"They can go in any direction,\" said a senior security official in Hong Kong. \"The old route was via Russia or one of the former Soviet bloc states. But many now fly directly to a west European capital and then move on. \"We know a lot about the snakeheads who control the boats going across to Canada and the US from the south China coast. But, increasingly, Chinese migrants are just taking the train to Moscow, or getting a tourist visa for Austria or Greece.\" The smugglers have been known as snakeheads for many years: their clients are described as \"human snakes\". A group that arrives in England is unlikely to have travelled en masse from China. \"They may or may not know one another already,\" said the security official, \"but they will only assemble at the last stage of the journey.\" Triads A small number of migrants flee for political reasons, fearing that they will be detained, often without trial, because of association with an illegal protest group or with a religious cult such as the banned Falungong. But the great majority are economic migrants from south China, particularly the coastal provinces of Guangdong, Fujian and Zhejiang. The outward flow of Chinese workers began more than 150 years ago and is taken for granted in the region. The snakeheads place public advertisements with the slogan \"overseas labourers wanted\", often on city walls or lamp-posts or outside local factories. Would-be migrants may pay up to $30,000 (\u00a320,400) for the snakeheads' service. In many cases they can only afford a deposit, and must agree to pay off the rest when they find employment abroad. Women who fall into debt may be forced into prostitution. Chinese snakehead gangs have close connections with western-based triads which originate in the southern provinces. Chinese illegal migrants often travel with passports issued by other Asian countries, such as Malaysia or Thailand, obtained illegally by the snakeheads. They may not need a visa to enter their first European stopping place. Or they will travel with an \"invitation letter\" written, for a price, by a citizen of the destination country. A typical route might be by train to Hungary or Poland, then on foot or by car into Austria or Germany and on to France or the Netherlands. Another route might be by air to Turkey or Greece, then by train though Austria to Italy. A third route is by air to Thailand or Malaysia where bogus documents are collected, then to Moscow and on to Prague or Bucharest. Direct air travel has become more popular than the long train journey via Russia, which requires more frontiers to be crossed. With the growth of tourism abroad, Chinese travellers have become less of a rarity. A Beijing airport border inspector was jailed yesterday, according to a human rights group, for helping a Chinese national leave the country with false documents. The Hong Kong-based information centre for human rights and democracy claimed that more than 3,000 people trying to leave illegally were stopped at Beijing airport last year. The economic migrants usually come from Chinese towns rather than the countryside, and possess enough funds to pay at least a deposit to the snakeheads. They are not living in desperate poverty but seek a better life. They may include doctors, musicians, clerks and teachers as well as unskilled workers. Some will have a relative abroad who has painted an attractive picture of the opportunities available. Britain already has a large, well-established population of legal Chinese migrants from Guangdong, the province that borders Hong Kong, and to a lesser extent from Fujian. Some illegal migrants have been apprehended after travelling long distances by air. South Africa and some South American countries have been used as the first stepping stone. The traffic began to attract western attention in the early 1990s. The German border guards directorate concluded in 1993 that the smugglers were adept at evading controls and possessed sufficient funds to bribe frontier officials. The Chinese government is fully aware of the negative publicity aroused by recent boat arrivals in north America and has taken more energetic steps to stop the traffic. Government publicity in the coastal provinces warns those who are tempted that they may face deportation if they arrive, or death on the way. China's public security ministry says that more than 9,000 stowaways and more than 900 snakeheads were arrested last year by border police. In January, the ministry called for \"a tighter crackdown on crimes in border and coastal areas\" involving smuggling of people. These were \"detrimental to the country's stability and national interest\" and had damaged China's reputation abroad. Also in January the United States deported 246 stowaways back to Fujian province in an effort to stem the flow. Trapped In the wake of closer US and Chinese cooperation, experts believe that would-be Chinese migrants and asylum seekers are increasingly shifting to European destinations. Many are deceived by illegal operators who claim that entry into an EU country is easier and that asylum is guaranteed on arrival. Land and air travel is regarded as less dangerous than passage in the containers crossing the Pacific where the migrants are trapped for more than a week in foul air and darkened boxes. Tragically the 58 who died on the way to Dover would have thought that their ordeal would be safe and short. Their fate is likely to be widely reported in the Chinese press, which is now less inhibited than it used to be about reporting national disasters.",

      "body": "<p><strong> No 26: Sleep apnoea</strong> </p> <p> Up to 4% of people experience sleep apnoea, where they repeatedly stop breathing for 10 seconds or more while asleep. It is often related to heavy snoring. Doctors have linked the condition to stroke, heart disease and other problems. But a review of the evidence shows that sleep apnoea is not a major health hazard and raises question marks over common treatments. </p> <p> <strong> What is it?</strong> </p> <p> Understanding of sleep apnoea is still in its infancy. The condition, identified in the last 15 years, is caused by repeated collapsing of the upper airways, often due to excess fat in the neck area, which stops breathing for short periods.

      "bodyText": "No 26: Sleep apnoea Up to 4% of people experience sleep apnoea, where they repeatedly stop breathing for 10 seconds or more while asleep. It is often related to heavy snoring. Doctors have linked the condition to stroke, heart disease and other problems. But a review of the evidence shows that sleep apnoea is not a major health hazard and raises question marks over common treatments. What is it? Understanding of sleep apnoea is still in its infancy. The condition, identified in the last 15 years, is caused by repeated collapsing of the upper airways, often due to excess fat in the neck area, which stops breathing for short periods. This may cause loud snoring. It typically affects middle-aged, overweight men but the problem increases with age. Many sufferers do not realise they have the condition. Often it is partners who send them to a doctor. Daytime sleepiness - due to poor rest at night - is a common symptom, but also experienced by nearly half of the population. Is it bad for the health?

      "bodyText": "Detectives are holding the driver of a Dutch-registered vehicle on suspicion of manslaughter, over the deaths of 54 men and four women discovered in the back of a lorry on Sunday at Dover. Two survivors were this afternoon still too traumatised to be thoroughly questioned by police. The Kent police superintendent Dennis McGookin, who led the hunt for the M25 killer, Kenneth Noye, told a lunchtime press conference that the two men are being held at a secure police facility after receiving treatment yesterday at the Kent and Canterbury hospital. Police fear that criminal gangs behind the illegal trade could seek to track down the two survivors. Those who did not survive their journey in the back of a sealed refrigeration unit were all in their twenties, police said today. Preliminary postmortem examinations suggest they died from respiratory failure. Three Dutch police officers have joined the Kent investigation, which, Mr McGookin said, has also received \"excellent communication and support from the Chinese embassy\" and Beijing police. Van der Spek Transporten, the company which leased the 15-meter truck, was set up just last week in Rotterdam by a 24-year-old Dutch engineer, Dutch authorities said. Police refused to comment on speculation that the same man, identified as Arie van der Spek, may have driven the truck over. The illegal immigrants were stowed with a consignment of tomatoes and the refrigeration was turned off. Police could not confirm whether their suspect would be charged or released this evening, although Mr McGookin reaffirmed that the deaths of the 58 was being treated as \"a homicide\". Mr McGookin appealed for family members of the 58 to come forward, although \"no decision\" has been made on the issue of an amnesty for relatives who may also be illegal immigrants. Solicitor Wahplow Tan last night said he had been contacted by British-based families who suspected that they might have relatives among the dead. He said some relatives may themselves be illegal immigrants and therefore be reluctant to come forward with information.",

Our system of control is led by science - with different arrangements for control and different penalties according to the classification of the drug.

Together with the 1995 white paper, 'Tackling Drugs Together', time was the only barrier preventing common sense from emerging. The delayed Police Foundation report is likely to recommend decriminalisation of personal possession. You, the PM and the deputy PM, are together the biggest obstacle preventing a change of law in this country. But public opinion is not with you on the subject of cannabis. </p> <p><b>JS:</b> postperson, we have built on the drugs strategy of the previous government, not least by the appointment of the UK drugs coordinator (Keith Hallawell), and by additional funds for prisons' drug treatment, and for the new drug treatment and testing order. We are working hard to improve coordination, especially between the NHS and the criminal justice system. I agree: the prime minister, John Prescott and I are obstacles in the way of legalising cannabis, since we do not believe that this is sensible. </p> <p> <b>quux:</b> Words by a certain Mr T Blair on the government proposals for the FoI act: \"This white paper explains our proposals for meeting another key pledge - to legislate for freedom of information, bringing about more open government. The traditional culture of secrecy will only be broken down by giving people in the United Kingdom the legal right to know. This fundamental and vital change in the relationship between government and governed is at the heart of this white paper.\" </p> <p>Can I ask how you could square this with a) Giving yourself power to veto the release of any documents. b) Withholding certain documents for 30 or 75 years before making them available. Why are you attempting to maintain direct (or indeed any) government control over the release of information ? Just what have you got to hide ? </p> <p><b>JS:</b> Comrade, there is a fundamental flaw in your argument. We are not taking a power in the FoI bill by which ministers can \"veto the release of any document\" (don't believe everything you read in the Guardian.) Under the bill, public authorities will be required by law to release all kinds of documents, and can be ordered to do so by the information commissioner, the tribunal or the courts. It is only where the commissioner, the tribunal or the courts say that there is no duty to release that the authority then has a discretion as to whether to release or not. Even here, the law is tilted in favour of release. </p> <p> <b>robbarnes:</b> Having been a member of the armed forces since 1985, and holding a position now which is considered to be middle management, I would like to ask you how the government feels when it is publicly announced that approximately 30% of junior ranks within the forces are eligible to draw either income support or family credit benefits? Surely a man who is representing the government and the country in the way that we do has the right to a decent wage in order to keep his family. </p> <p><b>JS:</b> I am sorry that I'm not immediately familiar with the pay structure of the armed forces - but I will pass on your concerns to Geoff Hoon, the defence secretary and ask him to send you a reply. However, I applaud people who serve in the armed forces and can tell you that as a government we are committed to the proper defence of this country. </p> <p><b>MaxSurvise:</b> If the home secretary realises that there is such furore over Pinochet's extradition, and countries as far as Belgium are vehemently protesting over him being sent home, why does he not feel compelled to review the case? The landmark indictment of the Chadian dictator on Friday was inspired by the Pinochet case. Perhaps Mr Straw could take note and also make history? </p> <p><b>JS:</b> Of course I understand the strong feelings which people have about this case. However, my duty in this extradition case, as in any other, is to apply the law in the fairest way I can. </p> <p><b>JS:</b> I'm sorry that I have to go. I've greatly enjoyed this conversation. I'll do my best to reply separately to some of the specific questions asked, but for which I have not had time to answer now. </p> <p>Best wishes,</p> <p>Jack Straw.</p>",

I agree: the prime minister, John Prescott and I are obstacles in the way of legalising cannabis, since we do not believe that this is sensible. quux: Words by a certain Mr T Blair on the government proposals for the FoI act: \"This white paper explains our proposals for meeting another key pledge - to legislate for freedom of information, bringing about more open government. The traditional culture of secrecy will only be broken down by giving people in the United Kingdom the legal right to know. This fundamental and vital change in the relationship between government and governed is at the heart of this white paper.\" Can I ask how you could square this with a) Giving yourself power to veto the release of any documents. b) Withholding certain documents for 30 or 75 years before making them available. Why are you attempting to maintain direct (or indeed any) government control over the release of information ? Just what have you got to hide ? JS: Comrade, there is a fundamental flaw in your argument. We are not taking a power in the FoI bill by which ministers can \"veto the release of any document\" (don't believe everything you read in the Guardian.) Under the bill, public authorities will be required by law to release all kinds of documents, and can be ordered to do so by the information commissioner, the tribunal or the courts. It is only where the commissioner, the tribunal or the courts say that there is no duty to release that the authority then has a discretion as to whether to release or not. Even here, the law is tilted in favour of release. robbarnes: Having been a member of the armed forces since 1985, and holding a position now which is considered to be middle management, I would like to ask you how the government feels when it is publicly announced that approximately 30% of junior ranks within the forces are eligible to draw either income support or family credit benefits? Surely a man who is representing the government and the country in the way that we do has the right to a decent wage in order to keep his family. JS: I am sorry that I'm not immediately familiar with the pay structure of the armed forces - but I will pass on your concerns to Geoff Hoon, the defence secretary and ask him to send you a reply. However, I applaud people who serve in the armed forces and can tell you that as a government we are committed to the proper defence of this country. MaxSurvise: If the home secretary realises that there is such furore over Pinochet's extradition, and countries as far as Belgium are vehemently protesting over him being sent home, why does he not feel compelled to review the case? The landmark indictment of the Chadian dictator on Friday was inspired by the Pinochet case. Perhaps Mr Straw could take note and also make history? JS: Of course I understand the strong feelings which people have about this case. However, my duty in this extradition case, as in any other, is to apply the law in the fairest way I can. JS: I'm sorry that I have to go. I've greatly enjoyed this conversation. I'll do my best to reply separately to some of the specific questions asked, but for which I have not had time to answer now. Best wishes, Jack Straw.",

The commission said that a minority of members should be elected, but refused to say how many.</p> <p>Mrs Beckett told MPs yesterday that ministers were \"minded to accept the broad outlines\" of the Wakeham proposals. But she said the government first wanted to listen to the views of MPs from both sides of the house.</p> <p>Watched by Lord Wakeham, sitting in the peers' gallery, Mrs Beckett indicated that ministers would opt for Wakeham's lowest recommendation of the number of elected members because the government was determined to prevent the new chamber from challenging the Commons.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The government served notice yesterday that it has no intention of stepping up the pace of House of Lords reform, prompting accusations that the issue has been \"kicked into the long grass\". In the first Commons debate of the year on the future of the Lords, opposition MPs rounded on the government after ministers failed to indicate when they will set up a joint committee of MPs and peers to oversee reform. Margaret Beckett, leader of the Commons, said that the committee - a Labour manifesto pledge - would be set up \"in due course\". Asked whether this could be before the general election, she said: \"I would anticipate that. But there is a considerable period of time before that.\" Her remarks, in the first Commons debate since publication in January of the royal commission report on Lords reform, indicated that ministers are unlikely to embrace further changes to the upper chamber until well after the next election. Mrs Beckett said that the cross-party royal commission, which was chaired by the former Tory cabinet minister Lord Wakeham, \"may\" form the basis of further lords reform. Sir George Young, the shadow leader of the house, said Mrs Beckett's remarks showed that the government has no idea of how to press ahead with reform, even though ministers gave themselves five months to respond to the Wakeham report. \"We can see the long grass opening up to embrace this report,\" Sir George said. The royal commission was set up by ministers to consider proposals for the \"second stage\" of Lords reform after the majority of hereditary peers were removed last year. The 12-member commission called for members of the up per house to be largely nominated by an independent appointments commission, stripping the prime minister of one of his most important powers of patronage. There would be a balance of political opinion to reflect the results of the latest general election, although no party would have an overall majority. The commission said that a minority of members should be elected, but refused to say how many. Mrs Beckett told MPs yesterday that ministers were \"minded to accept the broad outlines\" of the Wakeham proposals. But she said the government first wanted to listen to the views of MPs from both sides of the house. Watched by Lord Wakeham, sitting in the peers' gallery, Mrs Beckett indicated that ministers would opt for Wakeham's lowest recommendation of the number of elected members because the government was determined to prevent the new chamber from challenging the Commons.",

      "body": "<p>\"I feel safe and secure,\" said the secretary of state for Northern Ireland, Peter Mandelson, in Cork, 300 miles away from his residence of Hillsborough Castle. Army bomb disposal experts were combing the eight acres of Mandelson's official residence after a farmer discovered a crude home-made bomb in the grounds.</p> <p>The explosive device, which had \"partially exploded\", is believed to have been thrown over the walls of the grounds weeks earlier, possibly by republican dissidents. If so, the device was probably intended to disrupt a planned garden party for victims of the Troubles, which was attended by the Prince of Wales last Tuesday.</p> <p>It was during the visit by Prince Charles that the secretary of state came as close as he ever will to injury, or at least embarrassment, when a police dog snarled at him during a morale boosting mission to the RUC drugs squad in Ballymena, Co Antrim.</p> <p>The secretary of state is very well defended. Everywhere he goes in Ulster he is flanked by three tall men. The two with earpieces and muscles are to catch any bullet or missile with Mandy's name on it. The tall skinny one, who seems have a rare condition which causes him to nod his head sagely whenever the secretary of state speaks, is Tom Kelly, the director of information at the Northern Ireland office. His job is to prevent any inquiring question reaching the ears of his master.</p> <p>According to \"friends\" of the previous occupant of Hillsborough, Mo Mowlam, the greatest threat to the secretary of state is internal. Ms Mowlam was plagued by a series of damaging leaks while in office.

      "bodyText": "\"I feel safe and secure,\" said the secretary of state for Northern Ireland, Peter Mandelson, in Cork, 300 miles away from his residence of Hillsborough Castle. Army bomb disposal experts were combing the eight acres of Mandelson's official residence after a farmer discovered a crude home-made bomb in the grounds. The explosive device, which had \"partially exploded\", is believed to have been thrown over the walls of the grounds weeks earlier, possibly by republican dissidents. If so, the device was probably intended to disrupt a planned garden party for victims of the Troubles, which was attended by the Prince of Wales last Tuesday. It was during the visit by Prince Charles that the secretary of state came as close as he ever will to injury, or at least embarrassment, when a police dog snarled at him during a morale boosting mission to the RUC drugs squad in Ballymena, Co Antrim. The secretary of state is very well defended. Everywhere he goes in Ulster he is flanked by three tall men. The two with earpieces and muscles are to catch any bullet or missile with Mandy's name on it. The tall skinny one, who seems have a rare condition which causes him to nod his head sagely whenever the secretary of state speaks, is Tom Kelly, the director of information at the Northern Ireland office. His job is to prevent any inquiring question reaching the ears of his master. According to \"friends\" of the previous occupant of Hillsborough, Mo Mowlam, the greatest threat to the secretary of state is internal. Ms Mowlam was plagued by a series of damaging leaks while in office. Somebody in Stormont did not like her and fed the DUP with a series of embarrassing documents from her office, the best of which was Tom Kelly's masterplan on how to manipulate the media ahead of the 1998 referendum on the Belfast Agreement. The paramilitaries have been more of an embarrassment to the secretary of state than a danger. The IRA may have come close to killing the then secretary of state Peter Brooke in 1991, but that was nothing personal, so to speak.

The former Greek prime minister, Constantine Mitsotakis, is willing to act as an interlocutor between the west and Mr Milosevic, his \"close friend\" and sailing partner.</p> <p>Mr Mitsotakis, who belongs to the opposition New Democracy party, has a reputation as the only western politician the Yugoslav leader trusts.</p> <p>Last week Mr Mitsotakis reportedly vowed to undertake the mission if the US guaranteed that it was serious and that he was not made an \"international laughing stock\".</p> <p>Denying the New York Times report, the state department yesterday repeated the official position tha Washington would never contemplate offering Mr Milosevic an amnesty from war crimes.</p> <p>Any international amnesty deal behind the back of the Hague tribunal would seriously undermine its authority in administering justice in the wake of the Croatian, Bosnian and Kosovo wars.</p> <p>Last year the US slapped down opposition leaders in Serbia who sought to arrange an asylum deal for Mr Milosevic as a means of ensuring a peaceful transition of power.</p> <p>\"If there is any place where he seeks sanctuary, I would recommend the Hague,\" the US defence secretary, William Cohen, said at the time. Washington has offered a $5m reward for information leading to Mr Milosevic's arrest and delivery to the Hague tribunal.</p> <p>One year on, however, the Serbian opposition remains as divided as ever and apparently no closer to ousting Mr Milosevic under its own steam. Disillusionment has made the people of Belgrade sceptical of suggestions that he may step down. The rumours tend to be believed only by senior opposition figures. \"Wishful thinking. They've screwed it up so that's all they've left,\" said one Belgrade shop assistant.</p> <p>But the Clinton administration is running out of time, and is deeply concerned about its final balance sheet. Greek officials at the foreign ministry said they believed Mr Milosevic was biding his time until the US presidential election - a view echoed in Belgrade - in the hope of a Republican victory.</p> <p>A British diplomat said the Clinton administration's hopes were deluded. \"I don't see why he would do it. It's more dangerous for him to quit than it is to stay put.\"</p> <p>Once he cedes power Mr Milosevic will lose all his bargaining chips. Though he is beleaguered, the official opposition in Serbia is in disarray and unpopular. The police and army remain loyal. Street protests have fizzled out.</p> <p>One Nato country official insisted, however, that an amnesty was on the cards, saying: \"It's in the best solution for everyone, and they [Nato] could spin it as victory. There is a strong argument that democracy should be put ahead of the person.\"</p> <p>Greece, Belarus and Iraq are believed to be among countries ready to provide a haven. Shortly after the Bosnian war the Serb monastery on the self-governing Republic of Mount Athos, in northern Greece, prepared accommodation for Radovan Karadzic and General Ratko Mladic, though both remained in Serbia.</p> <p>According to the Serb opposition leader, Zoran Djindjic, Mr Milosevic has also been offered asylum in China. Of all possible bolt-holes, that is the most likely. His son, Marko, is believed to have recently flown to Beijing to negotiate transfers of family funds with officials in the government, with which his mother's Marxist party, the Yugoslav United Left, enjoys excellent relations.</p> <p>Chinese money has been pouring into Belgrade since the end of the Kosovo bombing. Advertisements in China encouraging nationals to emigrate have increased the number of Chinese people living in Serbia to nearly 100,000.</p> <p>However last year's indictment as a war criminal would complicate any deal. James Landale, the Hague tribunal's spokesman, said yesterday: \"The mandate of the tribunal is handed down by the security council. All states are obliged to cooperate. Anyone who is indicted is indicted for life. No one can nullify or dismiss an indictment, other than the security council.\"</p> <p>Any package deal for Mr Milosevic will have to include his unceasingly loyal wife. \"My husband is a perfect man,\" she wrote in her regular column in a women's magazine.</p> <p><b>The war leaders: at home, in prison - or dead</b><br><br>\u0095 <b>Radovan Karadzic</b> The Bosnian Serb wartime leader who was charged with crimes against humanity and genocide is still living in seclusion in his home in Pale.

Mr Mitsotakis, who belongs to the opposition New Democracy party, has a reputation as the only western politician the Yugoslav leader trusts. Last week Mr Mitsotakis reportedly vowed to undertake the mission if the US guaranteed that it was serious and that he was not made an \"international laughing stock\". Denying the New York Times report, the state department yesterday repeated the official position tha Washington would never contemplate offering Mr Milosevic an amnesty from war crimes. Any international amnesty deal behind the back of the Hague tribunal would seriously undermine its authority in administering justice in the wake of the Croatian, Bosnian and Kosovo wars. Last year the US slapped down opposition leaders in Serbia who sought to arrange an asylum deal for Mr Milosevic as a means of ensuring a peaceful transition of power. \"If there is any place where he seeks sanctuary, I would recommend the Hague,\" the US defence secretary, William Cohen, said at the time. Washington has offered a $5m reward for information leading to Mr Milosevic's arrest and delivery to the Hague tribunal. One year on, however, the Serbian opposition remains as divided as ever and apparently no closer to ousting Mr Milosevic under its own steam. Disillusionment has made the people of Belgrade sceptical of suggestions that he may step down. The rumours tend to be believed only by senior opposition figures. \"Wishful thinking. They've screwed it up so that's all they've left,\" said one Belgrade shop assistant. But the Clinton administration is running out of time, and is deeply concerned about its final balance sheet. Greek officials at the foreign ministry said they believed Mr Milosevic was biding his time until the US presidential election - a view echoed in Belgrade - in the hope of a Republican victory. A British diplomat said the Clinton administration's hopes were deluded. \"I don't see why he would do it. It's more dangerous for him to quit than it is to stay put.\" Once he cedes power Mr Milosevic will lose all his bargaining chips. Though he is beleaguered, the official opposition in Serbia is in disarray and unpopular. The police and army remain loyal. Street protests have fizzled out. One Nato country official insisted, however, that an amnesty was on the cards, saying: \"It's in the best solution for everyone, and they [Nato] could spin it as victory. There is a strong argument that democracy should be put ahead of the person.\" Greece, Belarus and Iraq are believed to be among countries ready to provide a haven. Shortly after the Bosnian war the Serb monastery on the self-governing Republic of Mount Athos, in northern Greece, prepared accommodation for Radovan Karadzic and General Ratko Mladic, though both remained in Serbia. According to the Serb opposition leader, Zoran Djindjic, Mr Milosevic has also been offered asylum in China. Of all possible bolt-holes, that is the most likely. His son, Marko, is believed to have recently flown to Beijing to negotiate transfers of family funds with officials in the government, with which his mother's Marxist party, the Yugoslav United Left, enjoys excellent relations. Chinese money has been pouring into Belgrade since the end of the Kosovo bombing. Advertisements in China encouraging nationals to emigrate have increased the number of Chinese people living in Serbia to nearly 100,000. However last year's indictment as a war criminal would complicate any deal. James Landale, the Hague tribunal's spokesman, said yesterday: \"The mandate of the tribunal is handed down by the security council. All states are obliged to cooperate. Anyone who is indicted is indicted for life. No one can nullify or dismiss an indictment, other than the security council.\" Any package deal for Mr Milosevic will have to include his unceasingly loyal wife. \"My husband is a perfect man,\" she wrote in her regular column in a women's magazine. The war leaders: at home, in prison - or dead \u0095 Radovan Karadzic The Bosnian Serb wartime leader who was charged with crimes against humanity and genocide is still living in seclusion in his home in Pale. The S-For peacekeeping troops patrolling the area have been reluctant to storm his house for fear of casualties. \u0095 Ratko Mladic The Bosnian Serbs' top general, who is living in retirement in the Yugoslav capital, is also wanted for genocide. He commanded the constant shelling of Sarajevo and the massacre of more than 7,000 Muslim men from Srebrenica. His full address is: 119 Blagoja Parovica, Banovo Brdo, Belgrade. He likes to go to horse races and football matches, and continues to draw a monthly pension from the Yugoslav government. \u0095 Zeljko Raznjatovic, known as Arkan. The leader of the paramilitary group the Tigers was charged last year in a sealed indictment, which was thought to include his role in massacres in Croatia in 1991, Bosnia in 1992 and possibly in Kosovo last year. He was gunned down in a Belgrade hotel soon after the indictment was issued. At the time of his murder, he had been exploring his options, sounding out at least one western country for asylum. \u0095 Momcilo Krajisnik Karadzic's right-hand man, and the most senior war crimes suspect to have been captured by Nato troops and delivered to the Hague, in April this year. He is accused of genocide and crimes against humanity for his part in implementing a policy of ethnic cleansing across Bosnia from 1991 to 1995. \u0095 Dusan Tadic Convicted on 11 war crimes counts by the Hague tribunal in 1997 for his part in running the horrific Omarska camp in the Bosnian Serb Republic where inmates, mostly Muslims, were tortured, raped and killed. He is currently appealing against his sentence.",

John Hunter Cambridge \u0095 We cannot stand the royals, positively loathe the Conservatives and football. We still support Labour. As cash-strapped OAPs, should we cancel the Guardian? PG Samways Christchurch, Dorset \u0095 Don Benlow asks (Letters, June 17) whether anyone remembers the song The Wibbly Wobbly Walk. I don't, but I do have a Blue Amberol cyclinder of a recording of Jack Charman singing it. The refrain concludes: \"They all smile the wibbly wobbly smile when the day is dawning, and all through the wibbly wobbly walk they get a wibbly wobbly feeling in the morning.\" Leonard Jacobs London \u0095 The recording can be found on Saydisc CD-SDLC 362 (Pleasures and Treasures 1986) or on Saydisc SDL 350.

      "body": "<p>Magistrates were yesterday under fire for failing to use newly strengthened powers to impose orders banning convicted football hooligans from travelling abroad to games. </p> <p>Police and Home Office sources argued that, despite being given the \"tools for the job\", magistrates were still reluctant to issue the bans, which can apply for up to 10 years.</p> <p>Only 23 international banning orders have been imposed since their introduction in October, compared with 203 domestic banning orders, which apply to home games.</p> <p>Amid yesterday's search for blame over the rioting in Belgium, magistrates, the govern ment, police and the crown prosecution service all sought to shrug off responsibility.</p> <p>Only one of the 584 Britons detained at the weekend had a order against him, prompting the government to claim at first that the system had worked.</p> <p>But the home secretary, Jack Straw, later underlined the widely shared conclusion that magistrates' powers are not being sufficiently used. He issued proposals to combine domestic and international bans under a single order. Courts would also be reminded to implement the orders, he told the Commons.</p> <p>Magistrates were granted wider powers to deal with hooligans, together with a greater obligation to act to prevent violence, under legislation which came into force in September. The Football (Offences and Disorder) Act imposes a duty on courts to impose banning orders if magistrates are satisfied \"there are reasonable grounds to believe\" doing so will reduce disorder at matches.</p> <p>One problem with the system is that, while the number of orders issued is known, the cases where courts have cho sen not to impose a ban is not centrally recorded, so no conclusions can be drawn over how often magistrates are shying away from issuing bans.</p> <p>One police source said: \"Magistrates courts are just not using the tools they now have to do the job. They should have been reminded of their legal responsibilities as they were before the last world cup.\"</p> <p>The source suggested that magistrates believed themselves to be concerned primarily with local law enforcement. \"Often magistrates will have people in front of them who is a local thug fighting at a local game and they don't regard him as a threat to international competition. They ban him from Cardiff City but don't prevent him getting to Charleroi.\"</p> <p>The Magistrates Association yesterday could offer no explanation over why courts had imposed so few international bans. Magistrates' clerks in the main footballing cities pointed out that the number of football-related offences coming before courts was now far lower than in the 70s and 80s, giving courts fewer opportunities to impose the orders.</p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.euro2000.org\">Euro 2000 Official site</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.the-fa.org\">Football Association</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ncis.co.uk\">National Criminal Intelligence Service</a> </p>",

      "bodyText": "Magistrates were yesterday under fire for failing to use newly strengthened powers to impose orders banning convicted football hooligans from travelling abroad to games. Police and Home Office sources argued that, despite being given the \"tools for the job\", magistrates were still reluctant to issue the bans, which can apply for up to 10 years. Only 23 international banning orders have been imposed since their introduction in October, compared with 203 domestic banning orders, which apply to home games. Amid yesterday's search for blame over the rioting in Belgium, magistrates, the govern ment, police and the crown prosecution service all sought to shrug off responsibility. Only one of the 584 Britons detained at the weekend had a order against him, prompting the government to claim at first that the system had worked. But the home secretary, Jack Straw, later underlined the widely shared conclusion that magistrates' powers are not being sufficiently used. He issued proposals to combine domestic and international bans under a single order. Courts would also be reminded to implement the orders, he told the Commons. Magistrates were granted wider powers to deal with hooligans, together with a greater obligation to act to prevent violence, under legislation which came into force in September. The Football (Offences and Disorder) Act imposes a duty on courts to impose banning orders if magistrates are satisfied \"there are reasonable grounds to believe\" doing so will reduce disorder at matches. One problem with the system is that, while the number of orders issued is known, the cases where courts have cho sen not to impose a ban is not centrally recorded, so no conclusions can be drawn over how often magistrates are shying away from issuing bans. One police source said: \"Magistrates courts are just not using the tools they now have to do the job. They should have been reminded of their legal responsibilities as they were before the last world cup.\" The source suggested that magistrates believed themselves to be concerned primarily with local law enforcement. \"Often magistrates will have people in front of them who is a local thug fighting at a local game and they don't regard him as a threat to international competition. They ban him from Cardiff City but don't prevent him getting to Charleroi.\" The Magistrates Association yesterday could offer no explanation over why courts had imposed so few international bans. Magistrates' clerks in the main footballing cities pointed out that the number of football-related offences coming before courts was now far lower than in the 70s and 80s, giving courts fewer opportunities to impose the orders.

The home secretary also told MPs that he intended to require the courts to impose international travel bans automatically on any hooligan convicted of a football-related offence in Britain. Magistrates have rarely used their discretionary power to impose bans, despite tightening of the law last September. Mr Straw added that the government's aim had always been to give the courts powers to impose travel bans on unconvicted fans, if police gave evidence that they were likely to commit violence. Ann Widdecombe, for the Tories, said she was willing to back emergency legislation to push through the crackdown, and accused Mr Straw of wasting a year before considering the measure. The plan was denounced by by the civil rights group Liberty since it breached the principle that everyone is innocent until proven guilty. However, senior football figures are exasperated with Mr Straw for failing to give the courts the extra powers already widely used in Germany. They also say that the level of policing at British ports and airports was minimal, one of the biggest causes of anger within Uefa. In another sign of tension between the Home Office and some British clubs, the clubs said the initiative to impose a life ban on convicted supporters came from them and not the Home Office. The Home Office yesterday revealed that a third of the 584 British citizens arrested in Belgium, and on which the police had any information, had criminal records. However, of nearly 400 deported, only 15 had previously been identified as football hooligans and one had been banned by the courts from attending games in Britain.

      "body": "<p> First of all, the cliches - an indispensable part of any commentary on football. The English thugs who rioted in Charleroi last Saturday cruelly damaged the reputation of more than what is sometimes called the \"beautiful game\". England, as a whole, has been diminished in the eyes of the world. The sceptred isle has become the home of hooligans - a country which breeds drunken louts who the government is unable or unwilling to control. </p> <p>The guilt should be widely spread and I am willing to accept my share. When I heard that the team - so recently victorious over Germany - might be ejected from Euro 2000, my immediate reaction was outrage and disbelief. Like David Davies, the executive director of the Football Association, I regarded disqualification as \"too awful to contemplate\". A more rational reaction would have been agreement that losing our place in the quarter finals was far less important than taking a stand against violence.</p> <p>No doubt the claims in mitigation are justified. Some innocent, genuine fans were penalised by the Belgium police. Many of the thugs were no more interested in the football than Zen Buddhism. None of that changes the basic facts of either the disgrace or the inadequate way in which we have responded to it. A hysterical media seems incapable of facing the awful truth that the disease is now endemic.</p> <p>On Sunday night radio, the junior home office minister, Lord Bassam, was asked why he ruled out emergency legislation to prevent Saturday's mayhem recurring on Tuesday. Parliament is probably in a mood to pass a bill in a single parliamentary sitting. But it seems unlikely that the SAS could have been deployed sufficiently swiftly to snatch the miscreants off the streets before the kick off. We need a change in culture at least as much as we need a change in the law.</p> <p>The disease is so widespread that it is impossible to identify the potential troublemakers.

      "bodyText": "First of all, the cliches - an indispensable part of any commentary on football. The English thugs who rioted in Charleroi last Saturday cruelly damaged the reputation of more than what is sometimes called the \"beautiful game\". England, as a whole, has been diminished in the eyes of the world. The sceptred isle has become the home of hooligans - a country which breeds drunken louts who the government is unable or unwilling to control. The guilt should be widely spread and I am willing to accept my share. When I heard that the team - so recently victorious over Germany - might be ejected from Euro 2000, my immediate reaction was outrage and disbelief. Like David Davies, the executive director of the Football Association, I regarded disqualification as \"too awful to contemplate\". A more rational reaction would have been agreement that losing our place in the quarter finals was far less important than taking a stand against violence. No doubt the claims in mitigation are justified. Some innocent, genuine fans were penalised by the Belgium police. Many of the thugs were no more interested in the football than Zen Buddhism. None of that changes the basic facts of either the disgrace or the inadequate way in which we have responded to it. A hysterical media seems incapable of facing the awful truth that the disease is now endemic. On Sunday night radio, the junior home office minister, Lord Bassam, was asked why he ruled out emergency legislation to prevent Saturday's mayhem recurring on Tuesday. Parliament is probably in a mood to pass a bill in a single parliamentary sitting. But it seems unlikely that the SAS could have been deployed sufficiently swiftly to snatch the miscreants off the streets before the kick off. We need a change in culture at least as much as we need a change in the law. The disease is so widespread that it is impossible to identify the potential troublemakers. If they were all real football supporters - hooligans who watch league matches and then enjoy a little violence on the side - they would be much easier to catch, convict and prevent from travelling abroad.

She put England on the way to victory in the first match, with her economic spell of 1-14 from nine overs.</em></p> <p> <strong>What does the MBE mean to you?</strong><br> I was delighted to receive it, especially as it was for something which I enjoy doing anyway. It's nice as well because it gives a bit of recognition to women's sport in general. </p> <p> <strong>Did you hear about it in advance?</strong><br> I actually heard on May 12. The letter came through to the ECB and they opened it by mistake. I got a message on my phone from Keith Pont of ECB saying, I want to talk to you urgently. At first I thought that I was in trouble but I phoned back anyway. He was more excited than I was I think - initially I was just relieved that I hadn't done anything wrong. He told me in strictest confidence but once it had sunk in I had to tell someone, so I told my Mum.</p> <p> <strong>What is the mood like in the England camp?</strong><br> Confident. There is a really good buzz around the squad. We desperately want to improve on the Australia and New Zealand tours in the winter [England lost all nine of their one-day internationals]. The Australian leg was dismal but the New Zealand leg wasn't too bad. It looked far worse on paper than it actually was. If we could have found another 30-40 runs from somewhere we would have been challenging them.</p> <p><strong> How do you think England will fare against South Africa?</strong><br> Realistically, going on past results and on current form, we should win. We need this series to build our confidence for the World Cup at the end of the year.</p> <p> <strong>How does it feel to be the senior player now that Karen Smithies [the ex-captain, dropped from the squad] is no longer in the team?</strong><br> Barbara Daniels is just in front of me in terms of age , which I'm very glad of. There is a lot of inexperience. Arran Thompson and Laura Harper are new and Dawn Holden and Nicki Shaw are fairly new so it is up to the older ones - me, BB [Barbara Daniels] Lucy Pearson and even Charlotte Edwards, who is still young but very experienced - to inspire them. But the new players are very enthusiastic and confidence won't be a problem.</p> <p> <strong>Have you played against the South Africans before? </strong><br> We played against them in 1997 and beat them 2-1, and then beat them in a 20-over thrash in our first game of the last World Cup. Three-quarters of their side are the same.</p> <p> <strong>Which of their players poses the biggest threat?</strong><br> Possibly they are a stronger batting side than bowling. Helen Davies, Kim Price, the captain, and Linda Olivier are the most experienced batswomen. And Cindy Eksteen, their vice-captain, is their fastest bowler. She is probably on a par with me, speed-wise.</p> <p> <strong>Is there any one ground you are particularly looking forward to playing at?</strong><br> I haven't got very fond memories of Taunton. They beat us there last time. We got 253 on the board and then they beat us off the final ball. It was a televised match and really put the cat among the pigeons. I've never played at Chelmsford before, and Worcester is a lovely ground, but I don't think the venue makes that much difference.</p> <p> <strong> Have you any goals in this series?</strong><br> I aim to play in all the games and to do well, and for the team to do well. I think that I am bowling better now than at any time in my career. Probably because I'm now looking over my shoulder - there is real competition for places, which is a good thing.</p> <p> <strong>Has Graham Dilley [England's bowling coach] helped you much?</strong><br> Yes, he is a very quiet bloke but what he says is worth listening to. I am now concentrating more on using the front arm, not just waving it about.</p> <p> <strong>What about your batting?</strong><br> Yes, well, I don't really talk about that. I'm definitely a member of the 10 and 11 union. I give it my best shot but it is usually tip-and-run with me.</p> <p> <strong> Will you miss Karen Smithies?</strong><br> Yes, on the personal level. She is quite a close friend and it is always sad when something like that happens. You always want to name the day when you retire. And it is hard to know what to say. But that is sport I suppose, and you end up being a bit selfish and, though you care about your teammates, concentrating on yourself. But hopefully she is going to come down for a few of the games so I can get to see her.</p> <p> <strong>Will you be able to watch the England v Romania match? </strong><br> All being well, we'll get South Africa in and get them out early. Then we can have a shower and see the match. We've been training for a week up at Lilleshall and we watched the other two England games in the bar there.</p> <p> <strong>Did you manage to catch any of the Edgbaston Test? </strong><br> Well we were looking forward to spending our rest day on Sunday watching it but ...</p> <p> <strong>When do you plan to retire? </strong><br> I hope to play in the World Cup in December and then see how that goes. I am still enjoying my cricket, and in the bleep test I register between 11 and 11.5, so I can still see off some of the youngsters.</p> <p><em>Tanya Aldred is assistant editor of Wisden Cricket Monthly. <a href=\"http://www.lords.org/ecb/itineraries/its_0020981.html\">Click here</a> for England's fixtures against South Africa this summer.

On Monday, she spoke to wisden.com about her MBE, her mate Karen Smithies and England's prospects in the one-day series against South Africa, which started on Tuesday. She put England on the way to victory in the first match, with her economic spell of 1-14 from nine overs. What does the MBE mean to you? I was delighted to receive it, especially as it was for something which I enjoy doing anyway. It's nice as well because it gives a bit of recognition to women's sport in general. Did you hear about it in advance? I actually heard on May 12. The letter came through to the ECB and they opened it by mistake. I got a message on my phone from Keith Pont of ECB saying, I want to talk to you urgently. At first I thought that I was in trouble but I phoned back anyway. He was more excited than I was I think - initially I was just relieved that I hadn't done anything wrong. He told me in strictest confidence but once it had sunk in I had to tell someone, so I told my Mum. What is the mood like in the England camp? Confident. There is a really good buzz around the squad. We desperately want to improve on the Australia and New Zealand tours in the winter [England lost all nine of their one-day internationals]. The Australian leg was dismal but the New Zealand leg wasn't too bad. It looked far worse on paper than it actually was. If we could have found another 30-40 runs from somewhere we would have been challenging them. How do you think England will fare against South Africa? Realistically, going on past results and on current form, we should win. We need this series to build our confidence for the World Cup at the end of the year. How does it feel to be the senior player now that Karen Smithies [the ex-captain, dropped from the squad] is no longer in the team? Barbara Daniels is just in front of me in terms of age , which I'm very glad of. There is a lot of inexperience. Arran Thompson and Laura Harper are new and Dawn Holden and Nicki Shaw are fairly new so it is up to the older ones - me, BB [Barbara Daniels] Lucy Pearson and even Charlotte Edwards, who is still young but very experienced - to inspire them. But the new players are very enthusiastic and confidence won't be a problem. Have you played against the South Africans before? We played against them in 1997 and beat them 2-1, and then beat them in a 20-over thrash in our first game of the last World Cup. Three-quarters of their side are the same. Which of their players poses the biggest threat? Possibly they are a stronger batting side than bowling. Helen Davies, Kim Price, the captain, and Linda Olivier are the most experienced batswomen. And Cindy Eksteen, their vice-captain, is their fastest bowler. She is probably on a par with me, speed-wise. Is there any one ground you are particularly looking forward to playing at? I haven't got very fond memories of Taunton. They beat us there last time. We got 253 on the board and then they beat us off the final ball. It was a televised match and really put the cat among the pigeons. I've never played at Chelmsford before, and Worcester is a lovely ground, but I don't think the venue makes that much difference. Have you any goals in this series? I aim to play in all the games and to do well, and for the team to do well. I think that I am bowling better now than at any time in my career. Probably because I'm now looking over my shoulder - there is real competition for places, which is a good thing. Has Graham Dilley [England's bowling coach] helped you much? Yes, he is a very quiet bloke but what he says is worth listening to. I am now concentrating more on using the front arm, not just waving it about. What about your batting? Yes, well, I don't really talk about that. I'm definitely a member of the 10 and 11 union. I give it my best shot but it is usually tip-and-run with me. Will you miss Karen Smithies? Yes, on the personal level. She is quite a close friend and it is always sad when something like that happens. You always want to name the day when you retire. And it is hard to know what to say. But that is sport I suppose, and you end up being a bit selfish and, though you care about your teammates, concentrating on yourself. But hopefully she is going to come down for a few of the games so I can get to see her. Will you be able to watch the England v Romania match? All being well, we'll get South Africa in and get them out early. Then we can have a shower and see the match. We've been training for a week up at Lilleshall and we watched the other two England games in the bar there. Did you manage to catch any of the Edgbaston Test? Well we were looking forward to spending our rest day on Sunday watching it but ... When do you plan to retire? I hope to play in the World Cup in December and then see how that goes. I am still enjoying my cricket, and in the bleep test I register between 11 and 11.5, so I can still see off some of the youngsters. Tanya Aldred is assistant editor of Wisden Cricket Monthly.

Such is the degree of concern about fuel prices in the mid-west American heartland that President Bill Clinton last week asked the federal trade commission to investigate the prices being charged at the pumps - some of which are reported to have run dry in Detriot at the weekend.

With the Opec meeting tomorrow pressure is now building for the oil producing nations to increase production to help reduce prices. Speaking yesterday, Ali Rodriguez, Opec's president, appeared to suggest that the nations were prepared to increase output for the second time since March, when it was raised by 7%. Mr Rodriguez, while insisting that there was not a supply problem, was quoted as saying: \"There is an intense problem of speculation, especially in the US because of the gasoline problem. \"If necessary, production will be raised - but that is what we have to analyse, whether an increase is necessary because there is no supply problem.\" His comments were cited as a reason for slight easing of oil prices yesterday on the major exchanges but the key indicator, crude oil, remained above the $30-a-barrel mark which even the producers themselves are thought to regard as being too high.

A \u00a3571m writedown on the computer system was forced after the government announced earlier this year that pensions and benefits would be paid directly into claimants' bank accounts from 2003 instead of being handled by the Post Office. Those payments account for over a third of the income for branch post offices. The Post Office had earmarked \u00a31bn to be spent on introducing a computer sys tem across its 18,500-strong network which would have dealt with pension and benefit payments and other services.

In 2001 the government requires the Post Office to achieve a pre-tax profit of \u00a3392m. Domestic letters carried by Royal Mail increased by 4.6% to 80m in the year. However, the explosion of text messaging on mobile phones and email has shaved 1.7% off the growth in Royal Mail volumes.

      "body": "<p>The mobile phone revolution hit Wales last week and crashed, leaving 2,000 mainly young entrants to the new economy redundant at a stroke. Angry ex-employees of 1st Line Mobile Communications, many of them unable to meet their bills, gathered outside the company's two call centres in Swansea and Cardiff to demand an explanation - and their weekly wages, which went unpaid. </p> <p>In Swansea the anger was so intense that windows were smashed, but the directors of a company that had promised to be part of a paradigm shift in the Welsh economy from traditional manufacturing to services were nowhere to be found.</p> <p>1st Line had abruptly ceased trading, blaming the withdrawal of support from \"a major creditor\" - and owing, it is understood, millions of pounds. Only now, as former staff, some of whom had worked for the company for a matter of days, learn they may get some of their money and/or redundancy payments, is that understandable ire beginning to abate.</p> <p>On June 27 the few remaining directors, shareholders and creditors will be asked to approve insolvency experts Grant Thornton, or another firm of accountants, as liquidator.</p> <p>This sorry demise of a company born less than two years ago has brought a fair share of anger, too, to hapless members of the new national assembly, including first secretary Rhodri Morgan, unable to intervene because no government aid is involved, and to frustrated union officials, denied negotiating rights and told just four days before the company went under that an initial swath of 450 job losses would rescue it.</p> <p>There are signs a week after 1st Line's collapse that the company is being treated, as Max Munday of the Welsh economy research unit at Cardiff business school puts it, as \"an aberration\" and one that poses no serious risk to the present and future role of call centres in propelling Wales towards a high-quality, hi-tech service economy.</p> <p>Certainly, the company engaged in some unusual business and employment practices, which one MP has likened to those of the 19th century.</p> <p>Consumer programmes such as the BBC television's Watchdog (and our own consumer pages) reported a spate of complaints from customers, many of them elderly, about hard-sell cold-calling and activating bank direct debits before the promised 30-day trial period was over.</p> <p>Too much, too soon</p> <p>But 1st Line grew to the extent it could claim to be Britain's biggest retailer of post-pay mobile phones, with 250,000 customers and staff, often teenagers, earning up to \u00a31,000 a week in pay and commission. But the staff was undergoing about the same rate of \"churn\" as the customers, many of them leaving in disgust at practices such as waving fistfuls of tenners to encourage them to sell, forcing slow learners to stand in corners with a dunce's hat on and dressing down in public those unable to make a quick sale.</p> <p>This year the business ran into financial difficulties as daily sales fell from 500 to just five at the end of May. A television relaunch featuring Melinda Messenger, and extensive retraining of staff failed to staunch the losses. 1st Line was, essentially, a telesales unit with no assets and, as churn grew, four directors quit the board.</p> <p>One, Philip Ruddall, has said he was told that the company had no chance of succeeding. Its marketing agency, it is understood, presented a winding-up order to it, and Cellular Ops, which handled billing and supplied the Ericsson mobile phone handsets, pulled the plug.</p> <p>But the company was just one of 80 call centres in Wales where, after its demise, more than 12,000 still work in the sector. Mr Munday says Wales has been successful in attracting relatively low-skilled jobs such as back-office functions within the financial services sector as a whole - rather than the high-quality call centres deliberately sought and won by cities such as Dublin and Glasgow.</p> <p>He is worried that Wales will lose out as business and its clients switch to web-based technology which does not rely on human contact.

      "bodyText": "The mobile phone revolution hit Wales last week and crashed, leaving 2,000 mainly young entrants to the new economy redundant at a stroke. Angry ex-employees of 1st Line Mobile Communications, many of them unable to meet their bills, gathered outside the company's two call centres in Swansea and Cardiff to demand an explanation - and their weekly wages, which went unpaid. In Swansea the anger was so intense that windows were smashed, but the directors of a company that had promised to be part of a paradigm shift in the Welsh economy from traditional manufacturing to services were nowhere to be found. 1st Line had abruptly ceased trading, blaming the withdrawal of support from \"a major creditor\" - and owing, it is understood, millions of pounds. Only now, as former staff, some of whom had worked for the company for a matter of days, learn they may get some of their money and/or redundancy payments, is that understandable ire beginning to abate. On June 27 the few remaining directors, shareholders and creditors will be asked to approve insolvency experts Grant Thornton, or another firm of accountants, as liquidator. This sorry demise of a company born less than two years ago has brought a fair share of anger, too, to hapless members of the new national assembly, including first secretary Rhodri Morgan, unable to intervene because no government aid is involved, and to frustrated union officials, denied negotiating rights and told just four days before the company went under that an initial swath of 450 job losses would rescue it. There are signs a week after 1st Line's collapse that the company is being treated, as Max Munday of the Welsh economy research unit at Cardiff business school puts it, as \"an aberration\" and one that poses no serious risk to the present and future role of call centres in propelling Wales towards a high-quality, hi-tech service economy. Certainly, the company engaged in some unusual business and employment practices, which one MP has likened to those of the 19th century. Consumer programmes such as the BBC television's Watchdog (and our own consumer pages) reported a spate of complaints from customers, many of them elderly, about hard-sell cold-calling and activating bank direct debits before the promised 30-day trial period was over. Too much, too soon But 1st Line grew to the extent it could claim to be Britain's biggest retailer of post-pay mobile phones, with 250,000 customers and staff, often teenagers, earning up to \u00a31,000 a week in pay and commission. But the staff was undergoing about the same rate of \"churn\" as the customers, many of them leaving in disgust at practices such as waving fistfuls of tenners to encourage them to sell, forcing slow learners to stand in corners with a dunce's hat on and dressing down in public those unable to make a quick sale. This year the business ran into financial difficulties as daily sales fell from 500 to just five at the end of May. A television relaunch featuring Melinda Messenger, and extensive retraining of staff failed to staunch the losses. 1st Line was, essentially, a telesales unit with no assets and, as churn grew, four directors quit the board. One, Philip Ruddall, has said he was told that the company had no chance of succeeding. Its marketing agency, it is understood, presented a winding-up order to it, and Cellular Ops, which handled billing and supplied the Ericsson mobile phone handsets, pulled the plug. But the company was just one of 80 call centres in Wales where, after its demise, more than 12,000 still work in the sector. Mr Munday says Wales has been successful in attracting relatively low-skilled jobs such as back-office functions within the financial services sector as a whole - rather than the high-quality call centres deliberately sought and won by cities such as Dublin and Glasgow. He is worried that Wales will lose out as business and its clients switch to web-based technology which does not rely on human contact. But Sandra Busby, head of the Cardiff and Newport call centre initiative, a body backed by the WDA and local authorities, disputes this. Future on the web Her remit is to attract new web-enabled, multi-channel call centres to south-east Wales, and so far, out of the 53 set up in the area, around a dozen have this greater technological facility. These include ones established by the Royal College of Nursing, the health and safety executive, Yes TV and the inland revenue, which tend to employ graduates and offer advice and consultancy on an interactive basis. \"Call centres are all about delivering customer services and the key to that is the skill and ability of the people working in them and any company which does not embrace that won't survive,\" she said. \"And these centres offer proper training and higher salaries. We are new compared to Dublin and Glasgow, and Wales employs just 1.1% of the labour force in call centres compared with a UK average of 1.9%. \"We are in a prime position to capture the new, multi-channel centres and many of the existing ones are upgrading to that status.\" Wales, which traditionally suffers from poor education and training, has pioneered a range of national vocational qualifications courses up to Level 4 which are geared towards call centre work and about to be launched and then rolled out across Britain.",

The announcement came less than 24 hours before the group was due to give details of a planned market listing for Europ@web, which had been expected to take place early next month. Groupe Arnault - the holding company of Bernard Arnault, the head of luxury goods group LVMH - said the decision followed \"recent discussions regarding strategic alternatives\". Industry watchers believe that one possibility could be that the group may have been concerned that market conditions might have affected the value it would realise from a listing. Europ@web's biggest investment is holding around one third of internet services provider Liberty Surf. The company's portfolio includes shareholdings in companies such as the British auction site, i-Collector, artprice.com and e-Luxury. Groupe Arnault said yesterday that it would continue to discuss its strategy options before going ahead with any listing for Europ@web. The group did not commit itself to a listing timetable - saying only that it had told the French stock market authorities that \"it will not be proceeding with the initial public offering of Europe@web before the summer\".",

The married father of three suggested the trio went on for a pizza and then \"out on the razzle\", Miss Melvin said. She had agreed and they had gone to Pizza Express for a meal and two bottles of wine - for which the Clwyd West AM had paid. At the end of the meal, Miss Melvin had ordered two cabs, but had been surprised when Mr Richards had joined the sisters in theirs. \"He said he wanted to see us home and that he would drop us en route,\" she told the court. But she thought this \"very odd\" since his Richmond flat was in the opposite direction to theirs. She said when the cab arrived at the sisters' flat some time after 11pm, Mr Richards \"said something about coming in for a coffee\". \"I said it would have to be quick as I was extremely tired,\" she said. But once inside the flat, Miss Melvin told the court, the 53-year-old declined the offer of a drink and smoked some cannabis with her sister. Tiffany Melvin quickly phoned for a minicab, however, later explaining to her sister he had been rude and she had wanted him to leave immediately, it was alleged. Cassandra Melvin, who said she had no idea of her unwanted guest's profession, told the court that, at the sound of a car, she showed the politician to the door and tried to shut it on him when she realised it wasn't his cab. A scuffle then ensued, she said. \"He said something like: 'It's not the cab, you fucking bitch.' He started pushing on one side. I was pushing on the other to try and close it. I was calling to Tiffany to help. She looked extremely distraught.\" As her sister phoned the police, Miss Melvin managed to push shut the door. But she opened it 20 seconds later to check if Mr Richards had gone. \"I took two steps forward and he jumped out, started swearing, and punching me straight in my face, on my nose. \"He then went to turn around and I grabbed his jacket. I said: 'you can't do this to me, you've no right to do this to me.' There was a bit of a scuffle... He grabbed my arm and literally threw me into a parked car. \"The pain was so severe I must have been knocked out. The last thing I remember was him being very close on top of me, lots of swearing and feeling petrified.\" She came to on the ground moments later to see Mr Richards running off, she said. The sisters then took a cab to Kingston hospital where Cassandra Melvin was treated for a broken left elbow, scraped knee and bruises to her nose. She still requires physiotherapy and has suffered depression and a breakdown in her relationship with her sister, whom she partly blames for the incident, the court heard. Under cross examination by Lady Mallalieu QC, Miss Melvin denied she had broken her arm falling in the street or that she had been the aggressor. Mr Richards, had behaved \"like a gentleman\" during the evening, said Lady Mallalieu. \"Here's a man who was trying to run away. It was you who were attacking him,\" she said. Miss Melvin replied that this was not true. The case continues today.",

In 35 years, Lord Mostyn never said a word in the House of Lords in defence of his vast, but shrinking, domain; indeed, he died without having made his maiden speech in the chamber.</p> <p>By 1997, his farming company, Mostyn Estates, was worth \u00a325m, making him the 859th wealthiest Briton. Increasingly, the family concentrated on urban land, particularly around Llandudno, which had become \"the queen of Welsh resorts\" because his great-grandfather, the local MP, EML Mostyn, put through an act of parliament controlling its development, and because the family controlled virtually all the town's freeholds. The well-planned Victorian community has thus been been protected from the vulgarity disfiguring nearby Rhyl.</p> <p>Born in Mostyn Hall, Flintshire, Mostyn went from Eton to the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst; aged 19 when the war broke out, he joined the 9th Queen's Royal Hussars, a tank regiment. He saw action in France, North Africa and Italy. Wounded twice, he was mentioned in dispatches, and was awarded the military cross in 1943, the year he married his first wife, Yvonne Stuart Johnson.</p> <p>After the war, the couple settled in Ireland, where they established a stud - which turned out several successful racehorses - and Mostyn be came a \"relentless point- to-point rider\". Their son, Llewellyn, and daughter, Virginia, were born there. The marriage ended in 1957, when he married Sheila Edmondson Shaw.</p> <p>It was only when Mostyn's father died in 1965 that they returned to Mostyn Hall, to take over the family estate, particularly the 250-acre farm. \"We entertain a lot during grand national week,\" his second wife disclosed. \"We have about 15 to 20 people staying here.\"</p> <p>Mostyn also played the role of lord of the manor. In 1966, he donned period costume to emulate an ancestor, who, 400 years earlier, had ridden into Caerwys to convey the Queen's blessing on the first eisteddfod. He continued his interest in horseracing, at least until 1968, when he took a bad fall at Worcester.</p> <p>Because of what his father had described as \"crippling taxation\", assets accumulated since the time of the first baronet in 1778 were liquidated. By 1974, the last of the magnificent Mostyn library was sold, in five separate Christie's auctions. In 1982, the British Museum paid him \u00a3500,000 for a 17th-century spring clock, made for William III by Thomas Tompion, Britain's greatest horologist. In 1991, Plas Mawr, in Conway - the country's finest surviving Elizabethan town house - was given to the nation, partly because it required expensive repairs.</p> <p>Mostyn's son becomes the 6th baron, no longer faced by the problem of speaking or voting in the Lords. His daughter and second wife also survive him.</p> <p>Roger Edward Lloyd Lloyd-Mostyn, 5th Baron Mostyn, landowner, born April 17 1920; died June 5 2000</p>",

      "bodyText": "The family of the 5th Baron Mostyn, who has died aged 80, were long the largest landowners in north Wales. In 35 years, Lord Mostyn never said a word in the House of Lords in defence of his vast, but shrinking, domain; indeed, he died without having made his maiden speech in the chamber. By 1997, his farming company, Mostyn Estates, was worth \u00a325m, making him the 859th wealthiest Briton. Increasingly, the family concentrated on urban land, particularly around Llandudno, which had become \"the queen of Welsh resorts\" because his great-grandfather, the local MP, EML Mostyn, put through an act of parliament controlling its development, and because the family controlled virtually all the town's freeholds. The well-planned Victorian community has thus been been protected from the vulgarity disfiguring nearby Rhyl. Born in Mostyn Hall, Flintshire, Mostyn went from Eton to the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst; aged 19 when the war broke out, he joined the 9th Queen's Royal Hussars, a tank regiment. He saw action in France, North Africa and Italy. Wounded twice, he was mentioned in dispatches, and was awarded the military cross in 1943, the year he married his first wife, Yvonne Stuart Johnson. After the war, the couple settled in Ireland, where they established a stud - which turned out several successful racehorses - and Mostyn be came a \"relentless point- to-point rider\". Their son, Llewellyn, and daughter, Virginia, were born there. The marriage ended in 1957, when he married Sheila Edmondson Shaw. It was only when Mostyn's father died in 1965 that they returned to Mostyn Hall, to take over the family estate, particularly the 250-acre farm. \"We entertain a lot during grand national week,\" his second wife disclosed. \"We have about 15 to 20 people staying here.\" Mostyn also played the role of lord of the manor. In 1966, he donned period costume to emulate an ancestor, who, 400 years earlier, had ridden into Caerwys to convey the Queen's blessing on the first eisteddfod. He continued his interest in horseracing, at least until 1968, when he took a bad fall at Worcester. Because of what his father had described as \"crippling taxation\", assets accumulated since the time of the first baronet in 1778 were liquidated. By 1974, the last of the magnificent Mostyn library was sold, in five separate Christie's auctions. In 1982, the British Museum paid him \u00a3500,000 for a 17th-century spring clock, made for William III by Thomas Tompion, Britain's greatest horologist. In 1991, Plas Mawr, in Conway - the country's finest surviving Elizabethan town house - was given to the nation, partly because it required expensive repairs. Mostyn's son becomes the 6th baron, no longer faced by the problem of speaking or voting in the Lords. His daughter and second wife also survive him. Roger Edward Lloyd Lloyd-Mostyn, 5th Baron Mostyn, landowner, born April 17 1920; died June 5 2000",

The Partners programme, involving 40 schools and six further education colleges on Tyneside, swaps lower A-level entry requirements at Newcastle for a programme of seminars, student-shadowing and a summer school on the campus in the city centre.</p> <p>Pupils selected from the region's most deprived areas by postcode, and then filtered by school heads and a joint school-university study of their classroom records, must complete the year-long programme to qualify.</p> <p>The university denied yesterday that the scheme represented any \"dumbing down\". There have also been worries among heads about the risk of a two-tier application system, decided on criteria too simplistic.</p> <p>Alan Smithers, of Liverpool University's centre for education and employment research, said universities put academic standards at risk if they bowed to pressure from the government for wider access through crude measures, such as postcodes. Newcastle said postcodes were only part of the system and were used with caution.</p> <p>Its vice-chancellor for teaching and learning, Madeleine Atkins, said: \"None of us has any doubt that Partners is getting at people whose past results have not told the full story about their academic potential; school students, for instance, who have worked long hours to bring money into homes where no one is in work.\"</p> <p>The programme is part of a \u00a31.7m scheme to widen access approved by the higher education funding council for England last year, and pre-dates the Tyneside pupil Laura Spence's failure to win an Oxford place - the rejection that triggered the elitism debate.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A radical plan to widen university intake by lowering the A-level entry requirements for some applicants has been set up to counter allegations of elitism. Seventy extra places have been created at Newcastle University for pupils previously thought likely to under-achieve in A-levels or from families where higher education had not been considered a realistic option. The Partners programme, involving 40 schools and six further education colleges on Tyneside, swaps lower A-level entry requirements at Newcastle for a programme of seminars, student-shadowing and a summer school on the campus in the city centre. Pupils selected from the region's most deprived areas by postcode, and then filtered by school heads and a joint school-university study of their classroom records, must complete the year-long programme to qualify. The university denied yesterday that the scheme represented any \"dumbing down\". There have also been worries among heads about the risk of a two-tier application system, decided on criteria too simplistic. Alan Smithers, of Liverpool University's centre for education and employment research, said universities put academic standards at risk if they bowed to pressure from the government for wider access through crude measures, such as postcodes. Newcastle said postcodes were only part of the system and were used with caution. Its vice-chancellor for teaching and learning, Madeleine Atkins, said: \"None of us has any doubt that Partners is getting at people whose past results have not told the full story about their academic potential; school students, for instance, who have worked long hours to bring money into homes where no one is in work.\" The programme is part of a \u00a31.7m scheme to widen access approved by the higher education funding council for England last year, and pre-dates the Tyneside pupil Laura Spence's failure to win an Oxford place - the rejection that triggered the elitism debate.",

What also makes me despair is all this hatred unleashed against me, both in my husband's country and in the Lebanon of my childhood. But I have time to discover other riches. At 43 years of age, I'd like to start living.\"",

Coe wanted him to find something which would provide interest, pleasure and - key Coe word - \"balance\". Hague admitted that he had always been interested in martial arts. So Coe arranged for Ray Stevens, his old Olympic chum (a silver medalist in Barcelona), to teach them both judo.</p> <p>It has been a source of much merriment to the rest of us and created a mini-scandal when Hague failed to declare that he was using the gym below Jeffrey Archer's riverside penthouse in the Commons Register of Members Interests. Coe was unrepentent - they paid for their own gear and Archer was not the only resident to invite them in, he insisted.</p> <p>All the same, it remains a sensitive subject and the photographs of the pair grappling with each other in their judo kit are no longer available. \"They weren't helpful,\" explains one insider. Did Hague once nearly strangle Seb, as reported? No. Did he knock him out and have to slap him awake? No. Does Hague always win? No, though he is younger and a stone or so heavier.</p> <p>\"Old age and treachery will always defeat youth and skill,\" Coe has been heard to joke.

      "body": "<p>The tragic discovery in Dover yesterday morning of 58 bodies in an airtight container lorry underlines the urgency of tackling the root causes of this murderous trade in asylum seekers. It is now virtually impossible for anybody, whether a genuine asylum seeker or an abusive economic migrant, to enter Britain legally.</p> <p>The Geneva convention on refugees was never designed to regulate the mass migration of people across the planet fleeing from poverty. Instead it is time to consider reform of Britain's and Europe's immigration policy. Asylum problems must be managed with asylum tools and migration problems with migration tools.</p> <p>Britain's 1971 Immigration Act was framed at a time when London was keen to honour its obligations to Commonwealth countries by ensuring that those who had already come had rights to bring the rest of their families. Beyond that, the door was firmly shut on any further primary immigration.</p> <p>It is no wonder that economic migrants from the developing world, especially after the fall of the Berlin Wall, started to batter on the asylum door instead. The growth of low-paid, \"black-economy\" service-sector jobs across Europe made it possible to live as an illegal, undocumented, person in a way that would have been impossible 20 years before.</p> <p>But the tragedies of mass deaths in the backs of lorries or of those who cling to the undercarriage of a plane leaving an African airport will continue until a better way of handling these migration flows is found.</p> <p>Politically it is difficult. Im migration has to be reinvented as a positive force and a way of reinvigorating our economy, culture and traditions in each generation, as it is in America, Australia and Canada.</p> <p>It is already recognised that the British Asian and Chinese millionaires play a crucial role in penetrating Britain's markets in Asia. Even the Daily Telegraph yesterday ran an editorial entitled Immigration Does Work and recognising that successive waves of migrants had saved the corner store and were significant generators of national prosperity today.</p> <p>The demographers and economists forecast that western Europe, Britain included, is heading for rising numbers of elderly people and a shrinking younger generation. The OECD believes that high volumes of migration will be needed to change the trend to ageing populations in Europe's prosperous countries.</p> <p>So what would an new comprehensive immigration policy for the era of globalisation in the 21st century look like? A policy of no immigration controls would soon see any government in power turned out of office. But a policy of opening the door could undermine the clandestine trade and be in Britain's economic interests.</p> <p>Already the Department for Education and Employment's overseas labour division has begun to acknowledge that Britain needs once again to open the door to an immigration policy based on its economic needs rather than its foreign policy objectives or asylum sympathies. It has just started advertising a fast-track entry to Britain for those with information technology and other skills in short supply.</p> <p>The Australians learned this lesson in the mid-1980s. They realised that their \"keep Australia white\" immigration policy was damaging their economy. It was politically difficult, but Australia's leading politicians maintained a consensus that they would not play the race card as their country opened up to Asian immigration. The net result was a far more flexible immigration policy, with all the economic and cultural benefits that have followed.</p> <p>America has long faced this problem and has a well-established system of greencard quotas for specific jobs. It meets the problem of weighing up the claims of economic migrants by simply putting the names of all those who qualify into a lottery to see who should be admitted. Canada operates a slightly more rational, but similar, points system.</p> <p>Difficult problems are involved. Those who flee tend to be the most motivated and the most hungry for success. It is a kind of social Darwinism that says those who survive the worst journeys, say across the Sahara, should be rewarded with a job and legal status in their chosen country.</p> <p>It is also indefensible to deprive the poorest countries of those with the most skills. It is said there are more doctors from Sierra Leone in Chicago than in the country itself.</p> <p>But these \"brain-drain\" arguments tend to prove marginal when looked at more closely. In a way, migrant communities prove a far more potent and effective way of helping the developing world than official overseas aid policies. The IMF estimated at the beginning of the 1990s that the global value of remittances sent home by migrant workers totalled $65bn a year - some $20bn more than the official global overseas aid effort.</p> <p>The tide of migrants will continue to flow. The question is whether death while in the hands of criminal traffickers should be a regarded as a normal part of life in the 21st century.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:alan.travis@theguardian.com\">alan.travis@theguardian.com</a></p>",

Britain's 1971 Immigration Act was framed at a time when London was keen to honour its obligations to Commonwealth countries by ensuring that those who had already come had rights to bring the rest of their families. Beyond that, the door was firmly shut on any further primary immigration. It is no wonder that economic migrants from the developing world, especially after the fall of the Berlin Wall, started to batter on the asylum door instead. The growth of low-paid, \"black-economy\" service-sector jobs across Europe made it possible to live as an illegal, undocumented, person in a way that would have been impossible 20 years before. But the tragedies of mass deaths in the backs of lorries or of those who cling to the undercarriage of a plane leaving an African airport will continue until a better way of handling these migration flows is found. Politically it is difficult. Im migration has to be reinvented as a positive force and a way of reinvigorating our economy, culture and traditions in each generation, as it is in America, Australia and Canada. It is already recognised that the British Asian and Chinese millionaires play a crucial role in penetrating Britain's markets in Asia. Even the Daily Telegraph yesterday ran an editorial entitled Immigration Does Work and recognising that successive waves of migrants had saved the corner store and were significant generators of national prosperity today. The demographers and economists forecast that western Europe, Britain included, is heading for rising numbers of elderly people and a shrinking younger generation. The OECD believes that high volumes of migration will be needed to change the trend to ageing populations in Europe's prosperous countries. So what would an new comprehensive immigration policy for the era of globalisation in the 21st century look like? A policy of no immigration controls would soon see any government in power turned out of office. But a policy of opening the door could undermine the clandestine trade and be in Britain's economic interests. Already the Department for Education and Employment's overseas labour division has begun to acknowledge that Britain needs once again to open the door to an immigration policy based on its economic needs rather than its foreign policy objectives or asylum sympathies. It has just started advertising a fast-track entry to Britain for those with information technology and other skills in short supply. The Australians learned this lesson in the mid-1980s. They realised that their \"keep Australia white\" immigration policy was damaging their economy. It was politically difficult, but Australia's leading politicians maintained a consensus that they would not play the race card as their country opened up to Asian immigration. The net result was a far more flexible immigration policy, with all the economic and cultural benefits that have followed. America has long faced this problem and has a well-established system of greencard quotas for specific jobs. It meets the problem of weighing up the claims of economic migrants by simply putting the names of all those who qualify into a lottery to see who should be admitted. Canada operates a slightly more rational, but similar, points system. Difficult problems are involved. Those who flee tend to be the most motivated and the most hungry for success. It is a kind of social Darwinism that says those who survive the worst journeys, say across the Sahara, should be rewarded with a job and legal status in their chosen country. It is also indefensible to deprive the poorest countries of those with the most skills. It is said there are more doctors from Sierra Leone in Chicago than in the country itself. But these \"brain-drain\" arguments tend to prove marginal when looked at more closely. In a way, migrant communities prove a far more potent and effective way of helping the developing world than official overseas aid policies. The IMF estimated at the beginning of the 1990s that the global value of remittances sent home by migrant workers totalled $65bn a year - some $20bn more than the official global overseas aid effort. The tide of migrants will continue to flow. The question is whether death while in the hands of criminal traffickers should be a regarded as a normal part of life in the 21st century. alan.travis@theguardian.com",

      "body": "<p>A suicidal University of Westminster lecturer lured a young colleague into a laboratory before bludgeoning her to death with a rolling pin because he did not want to die alone, Middlesex crown court heard yesterday.</p> <p>Steven Reid, 34, of Marylebone, west London, asked Elizabeth Stacey for help with his computer but when the 24-year-old IT technician sat down at a desk he struck her over the head with the cooking utensil, said Orlando Pownall, prosecuting.</p> <p>The court heard that when Miss Stacey was not immediately knocked unconscious by the blow, he attempted to tape her mouth and nose with masking tape he had bought the day before. He had previously cut it into strips and stuck it to the edge of a desk in order to suffocate her.</p> <p>She was found to have suffered multiple skull and facial bone fractures, said Mr Pownall.</p> <p>Her body was not found until shortly before noon the next day, Saturday, November 6.</p> <p>Friends and family had grown concerned at her disappearance after she failed to meet a close friend, Chris Bishop, who had travelled from Loughborough to meet her the day she disappeared. Mr Bishop reported her missing to Marylebone police who later that evening began a search of the university premisies.</p> <p>Reid denies murder, although the court heard that when interviewed by police he admitted killing her.</p> <p>The crown contends that Reid's actions leading up to and surrounding the death of Miss Stacey showed that he was in control of his acts and had meticulously planned to murder his colleague.</p> <p>The jury heard that on November 4 1999 Reid had gone to the John Lewis department store in London where he purchased a rolling pin, then later went to a Ryman's stationery shop and bought adhesive tape and a craft knife.</p> <p>Reid told police that the knife was a \"stop-gap\" measure that he would use to slash his wrists if an overdose failed.</p> <p>\"In the days leading up to November 5 he frequently considered committing suicide in Edinburgh, his place of birth,\" Mr Pownall told the court.</p> <p>\"He decided he did not want to die alone and chose the deceased as he wanted to go with someone he liked and respected. Of all the people in the office she was the only person who 'fitted the bill', to quote his words.</p> <p>\"Because Miss Stacey was kind to him he decided that he would kill her before committing suicide.\"</p> <p>The court heard that on the night before the murder Reid withdrew the maximum \u00a3250 from his bank account, and then removed the same sum the next morning.</p> <p>He later told police how he had left Westminster University and made his way to the first of two hotels in St Pancras, north London. Reid said that he had taken an overdose of aspirin, but was later sick. He then tried to slash his wrists but also survived this suicide attempt. Realising that the only two options available were to either give himself up or get out of London, he chose the latter.</p> <p>Police officers eventually caught up with Reid in Brighton after his photo had appeared on the BBC television programme Crimewatch on November 16.

      "bodyText": "A suicidal University of Westminster lecturer lured a young colleague into a laboratory before bludgeoning her to death with a rolling pin because he did not want to die alone, Middlesex crown court heard yesterday. Steven Reid, 34, of Marylebone, west London, asked Elizabeth Stacey for help with his computer but when the 24-year-old IT technician sat down at a desk he struck her over the head with the cooking utensil, said Orlando Pownall, prosecuting. The court heard that when Miss Stacey was not immediately knocked unconscious by the blow, he attempted to tape her mouth and nose with masking tape he had bought the day before. He had previously cut it into strips and stuck it to the edge of a desk in order to suffocate her. She was found to have suffered multiple skull and facial bone fractures, said Mr Pownall. Her body was not found until shortly before noon the next day, Saturday, November 6. Friends and family had grown concerned at her disappearance after she failed to meet a close friend, Chris Bishop, who had travelled from Loughborough to meet her the day she disappeared. Mr Bishop reported her missing to Marylebone police who later that evening began a search of the university premisies. Reid denies murder, although the court heard that when interviewed by police he admitted killing her. The crown contends that Reid's actions leading up to and surrounding the death of Miss Stacey showed that he was in control of his acts and had meticulously planned to murder his colleague. The jury heard that on November 4 1999 Reid had gone to the John Lewis department store in London where he purchased a rolling pin, then later went to a Ryman's stationery shop and bought adhesive tape and a craft knife. Reid told police that the knife was a \"stop-gap\" measure that he would use to slash his wrists if an overdose failed. \"In the days leading up to November 5 he frequently considered committing suicide in Edinburgh, his place of birth,\" Mr Pownall told the court. \"He decided he did not want to die alone and chose the deceased as he wanted to go with someone he liked and respected. Of all the people in the office she was the only person who 'fitted the bill', to quote his words. \"Because Miss Stacey was kind to him he decided that he would kill her before committing suicide.\" The court heard that on the night before the murder Reid withdrew the maximum \u00a3250 from his bank account, and then removed the same sum the next morning. He later told police how he had left Westminster University and made his way to the first of two hotels in St Pancras, north London. Reid said that he had taken an overdose of aspirin, but was later sick. He then tried to slash his wrists but also survived this suicide attempt. Realising that the only two options available were to either give himself up or get out of London, he chose the latter. Police officers eventually caught up with Reid in Brighton after his photo had appeared on the BBC television programme Crimewatch on November 16. They arrested him the following day. Reid told police and psychologists that in 1987 he tried to commit suicide by taking a combination of antibiotic pills and alcohol, but was sick and the attempt failed. He moved to London in 1992 and worked in a jobcentre. However, he \"found it difficult to make friends\", said Mr Pownall. As he was \"interested in psychology\" and \"hoped it might help him to get on with other people\" he enrolled at the University of Westminster and took a psychology degree. Hazel Dewart, chairwoman of the department of psychology at the University of Westminster, told the court Reid \"was very bright but not particularly sociable, he was certainly someone who tended to be withdrawn\". This was in contrast to Cambridge graduate Miss Stacey who graduated from Christchurch College two years ago with a BA and masters degree in physics, the court heard. Last September, she decided that she wanted to improve her IT skills, and began working at the University of Westminster as a lab psychology technician. \"What the defendant lacked in social skills, she had in abundance,\" said Mr Pownall. \"Those who had dealings with her described her as attractive, sweet, bright, gentle and warm. She always seemed to have time for everybody and became very popular. It may be those very attributes that caused the defendant to take her life.\" The trial continues.",

The government has a stated commitment to do exactly this - what it terms gender-impact assessment - yet it does not seem to happen often enough. For example, this year's budget statement contained little analysis of how new measures will affect women and men.

The national childcare strategy is beginning to address the large deficit in the number of places where children can be cared for while a parent works. However, expenditure is relatively small compared with the jobs programmes. Some \u00a3470m has been allocated for childcare over a five- year period and that is less than a fifth of the spending on the employment-focused new deals or an annual spend of about 0.01% of GDP. By comparison, Sweden spends almost 2% of GDP on childcare (and an additional 1% on maternity and parental leave); it also experiences some of the highest rates of female employment in Europe . In order to redress the imbalance in public spending between men and women, all policies are going to have to be examined for their incidence between the sexes and corrected if there is bias. The government has a stated commitment to do exactly this - what it terms gender-impact assessment - yet it does not seem to happen often enough. For example, this year's budget statement contained little analysis of how new measures will affect women and men. There was no examination at all of who does benefit from the bulk of public expenditure. \u0095 Katherine Rake lectures in social policy at the London School of Economics.

      "bodyText": "Conservative attempts to attack Labour's record on urban regeneration backfired yesterday when the shadow environment secretary told how he \"wound up all the windows\" while driving through the Toxteth district of Liverpool. Archie Norman was accused of \"negative stereotyping\" over the remark, made following a visit to the area which was the scene of riots in 1981. Gideon Ben Tovim, leader of the city's Labour group, whose Granby ward lies in Toxteth, said: \"It is just another example of negative stereotyping which ignores the gradual but significant improvements which are being made in the area.\" Mr Norman, who was speaking to MEPs, councillors and representatives of the region's business communities, said there \"wasn't a policeman in sight\" during his tour. A Conservative spokesman said: \"Archie's remarks were taken out of context. He had spent the whole day on foot in Toxteth before driving through the area and one of the issues people constantly raised with him was street crime. He was reflecting their concerns.\"",

Buoyed by a crisis-free summit which did not leave his government isolated in the traditional British fashion, the prime minister portrayed the EU's mid-summer get together as a vindication of his \"far more engaged and constructive\" approach to Europe, despite the tensions within the cabinet and the EU over his wait-and-see stance on membership of the euro. For Britain the crucial gain was a majority against the original version of the savings tax - leaving Luxembourg and Austria holding out against an alternative model - and routine exchanges of information between banks and tax collectors. The savings tax had threatened thousands of City jobs and could have undermined London's status as a leading financial capital. Though a final decision was delayed, Downing Street used the shift to praise Gordon Brown's \"extraordinarily relentless negotiating skills and tenacity\" - balm to the chancellor's soul after a week which saw him attacked by cabinet colleagues for trying to stifle debate in favour of Britain joining the single currency.

      "bodyText": "John Major is expected to strongly support the role of Parliament in tackling \"sleazy\" behaviour among MPs and the need for a tough ministerial code for ministers when he gives evidence to the Commons public administration committee next month. The former prime minister - who announced his unusual decision to give evidence yesterday - is understood to be keen to do so because he believes that Tony Blair has downgraded the importance of Parliament since he won his landslide victory in 1997. Mr Blair refused to give evidence to the same inquiry by the committee, sending Mo Mowlam, Chancellor of Duchy of Lancaster in his place. MPs plan to question Mr Major over the background to the cash for questions affair which led to the resignations of former ministers Neil Hamilton and Tim Smith. He will also face questions over his government's handling of the Jonathan Aitken affair, after the Guardian showed that the former cabinet minister's hotel bill at the Paris Ritz was paid by a Saudi Arabian arms dealer. The committee is examining whether the present ministerial code needs to be strengthened, as recommended by Lord Neill, chairman of the committee on standards in public life. It is also looking at whether an ethics commissioner should be appointed to police the code, which was rejected by Lord Neill. Lord Neill instead believes that the prime minister should be able to appoint an accountant or lawyer to investigate an erring minister and report to him in confidence. Mr Major encountered considerable criticism from Tory MPs when the last government implemented proposals from Lord Nolan, then chairman of the committee on standards on public life, which forced MPs to declare their income from directorships and consultancies, in the wake of the cash for questions scandal. Mr Major has always defended the former Cabinet secretary, Lord Butler, for his handling of the Aitken affair, although it was later proved in court that Mr Aitken had lied to both Lord Butler and Mr Major about his stay at the Ritz. Lord Butler has always maintained that it was difficult for a Cabinet secretary to handle an investigation into a minister but he also rejected the creation of a separate ethics commissioner. Mr Major is also expected to be questioned about the Tony Blair's huge increase in the number of special advisers, who have doubled inside the government and trebled inside Downing Street since Labour's 1997 election victory.",

To prosecute we need to catch them red-handed and for that we need to anticipate where they'll strike. I can't hide men behind every bush every night.</p> <p>\"If they see us coming they drop everything and say they were out for a walk. The older ones are teaching the next generation where to look.\" From beneath his desk the commander took out a cardboard box with two vases and a figurine wrapped in newspapers. \"We got these last week.

Bulldozers have been used in daylight. In 18th century watercolours of Pompeii frescoes can be seen which have since vanished.</p> <p>The world's largest collection of allegedly stolen archaeological treasures was found last year in the Sicilian home of art collector Vincenzo Cammarata, who police say was the mafia's conduit to Switzerland. Mr Cammarata says the more than 30,000 artefacts, valued at \u00a320m, were all registered. Five other Sicilians, including two professors, were charged with aiding and abetting him.</p> <p>Italian police have scored other successes. Last November six people were caught looting 250 relics from Hadrian's villa. In May an elaborately carved Roman sarcophagus was seized from a farmhouse near Rome. Four art dealers and a university lecturer are being investigated.</p> <p>Police systematically trawl the catalogue of auction houses like Sotheby's and Christie's, checking suspicious items on a database of stolen artworks. Some major pieces have been extricated from auction houses and museums.</p> <p>\"The trade is fuelled partly by competition among museums to acquire superstars,\" said the American Journal Archaeology.</p> <p>Lord Renfrew, professor of archaeology at Cambridge, is scathing about Britain's role. \"The government is in the pocket of the art market, which wants to keep the flow of antiquities. It's a scandal.\"</p> <p>He has been appointed to a committee established last month by the Department of Culture to report by the autumn on how to tackle the trade. Some archaeologists have a grudging respect for the tombaroli 's skill. Not Lord Renfrew: \"Thieves, looters, that is what they are.\"</p> <p>Back in Viterbo, Antonio shakes his head. \"I am not a criminal.

Antonio complains that surveillance is making his job impossible but the local police commander, who asked not to be named, sighed. \"If only. To prosecute we need to catch them red-handed and for that we need to anticipate where they'll strike. I can't hide men behind every bush every night. \"If they see us coming they drop everything and say they were out for a walk. The older ones are teaching the next generation where to look.\" From beneath his desk the commander took out a cardboard box with two vases and a figurine wrapped in newspapers. \"We got these last week. A fluke.\" Lack of resources is a refrain of the culture ministry, which watches over more than 3,000 museums, 6,000 libraries, 100,000 churches, 50,000 other buildings and more than 1,000 archaeological sites. In Sicily and southern Italy the tombaroli , reinforced by the mafia, are bolder. Bulldozers have been used in daylight. In 18th century watercolours of Pompeii frescoes can be seen which have since vanished. The world's largest collection of allegedly stolen archaeological treasures was found last year in the Sicilian home of art collector Vincenzo Cammarata, who police say was the mafia's conduit to Switzerland. Mr Cammarata says the more than 30,000 artefacts, valued at \u00a320m, were all registered. Five other Sicilians, including two professors, were charged with aiding and abetting him. Italian police have scored other successes. Last November six people were caught looting 250 relics from Hadrian's villa. In May an elaborately carved Roman sarcophagus was seized from a farmhouse near Rome. Four art dealers and a university lecturer are being investigated. Police systematically trawl the catalogue of auction houses like Sotheby's and Christie's, checking suspicious items on a database of stolen artworks. Some major pieces have been extricated from auction houses and museums. \"The trade is fuelled partly by competition among museums to acquire superstars,\" said the American Journal Archaeology. Lord Renfrew, professor of archaeology at Cambridge, is scathing about Britain's role. \"The government is in the pocket of the art market, which wants to keep the flow of antiquities. It's a scandal.\" He has been appointed to a committee established last month by the Department of Culture to report by the autumn on how to tackle the trade. Some archaeologists have a grudging respect for the tombaroli 's skill. Not Lord Renfrew: \"Thieves, looters, that is what they are.\" Back in Viterbo, Antonio shakes his head. \"I am not a criminal. I find history and I sell it.\" He prepares for another night among the tombs of his ancestors. His tools, a tube of mints and cigarettes will keep him going till 2am. \"I stick to the Etruscans now, my arms aren't so strong and their tombs are shallower. The Romans I'm leaving to future tombaroli .\" Recovered loot \u0095 Golden phial, 450 BC Excavated illegally near Palermo around 1984. Sold to a collector, for $1.2m. Returned to Italy in February \u0095 Marble sarcophagus, 2nd century BC Seized by police last month, foiling alleged plot to smuggle it to Switzerland for $1m \u0095 \u00a37.5 m statue of Aphrodite Returned by the Paul Getty Museum in California after it accepted it had been stolen \u0095 Capitoline Triade, 2nd century BC Marble statue stolen in 1992 and sold for \u00a32m to a Swiss dealer who was planning to sell it for \u00a33m to a collector when it was recovered",

Self-effacement was the name of the game as Davies admitted to trotting out routines he was doing back in 1992. His partner Catherine Porter assured us that he's not funny at home, and indeed he wasn't very funny off stage either. Nervous before a show, or exhausted and hungry afterwards, he was never likely to shine.

There was some tentative theorising about the roots of comedy as Davies discovered that Izzard, like him, lost his mother when he was six years old, and that Dave Allen's father had died when the budding comedian was 12. Did a craving for unqualified love propel these young men to the stage? Davies appeared embarrassed by the seriousness of the question he had raised - to which, after all, there can never be an answer. Ardal O'Hanlon announced that the only taboo area in his work was jokes about eating kebabs on the way back from the pub - mere moments after we'd watched Davies's spin on that very topic. Back in north London, Davies attended a cabaret workshop where a man did a mime of a fish out of water; it wasn't funny. If only he'd watched The Natural World, he might have made something out of that.",

      "bodyText": "The Russian army base of Khatuni, the frontline posting on the edge of Chechnya's still unconquered mountainous territory, has become one of the most perilous places in the war-torn region for the troops who serve there. Situated in the foothills of the dramatic mountain range dividing the separatist region from Dagestan to the east and Georgia to the south, the camp is highly vulnerable to nightly attacks from rebels living in the forests which surround it. Somewhere in these densely wooded mountains, the most powerful Chechen rebel leaders, Shamil Basayev and Khattab, are thought to be hiding alongside the Chechen president, Aslan Maskhadov. Russian generals estimate that around 3,000 guerrillas survived the eight-month onslaught on the region, and they believe most of them are roaming the hills in small bands, living in mountain camps. Now that the Russians' sweeping bombing campaign of the region has calmed, the army has adopted a new tactic for the remaining Chechen fighters: groups of soldiers are sent to hunt down the rebels in the woods and gorges. So far this approach has had limited success. Last week soldiers discovered a rebel camp, but it had been abandoned days earlier. After months of searching, the main guerrilla leaders remain at liberty. During the conflict, a few journalists have tracked down the warlords in their bases in the hills - but the army has been unable to catch them.

      "body": "<p>Poor shark. What a shrivelled and, according to some accounts, stinking shell of its former terrifying self. The organisers of an exhibition at the Museum of Decorative Arts in Paris, in which Damien Hirst's 1991 sculpture was supposed to appear, claim the famous shark is now just too rotten to go on show. It smells, it's green and a fin has fallen off. The shark's owner, Charles Saatchi, says, on the contrary, it's in \"fantastic condition\".</p> <p>Whatever the exact current state of the shark, there's no doubt that it has deteriorated. The wrinkly, leathery, dried-out remnant of a beast that appeared in Sensation at the Royal Academy in 1997 has little of the original terrifying appearance of Hirst's tiger shark. It has aged. Hirst called the work The Physical Impossibility of Death in The Mind of Someone Living. As the title implies, Hirst's artwork - which he made by commissioning an Australian shark-hunter to catch a full-grown shark - deceived the eye as to whether it was dead or not. When you stood in front of the tank of green liquid, and looked in the shark's grinning mouth, you could savour the illusion that a tiger shark was swimming towards you through the white space of the Saatchi Gallery. You were dinner.</p> <p>Seeing the shark now is more like creeping down into the Bates fruit cellar and finding mother embalmed in her chair. It's shocking, but in a Grand Guignol way. No one is going to confuse this dessicated relic with a living beast. Oliver Crinnen, curator of fish at the Natural History Museum, says it was not preserved properly back in 1991. Hirst and his team failed to inject formaldehyde fixing agent into its internal organs and it has rotted from the inside out.</p> <p>But if the shark is doomed, so are are many other contemporary artworks that are designed to collapse, fade and decay into the earth. Owning these artworks, whether you are Charles Saatchi or a museum, is a peculiar responsibility. You have to love them, nurture them, and yet accept that however much you spend on hi-tech storage your prized possession is, in the long run, doomed. Spare a thought for New York's Dia Foundation, which last year acquired Robert Smithson's 1970 artwork Spiral Jetty, a 1500ft earthwork in Salt Lake, Utah, that Smithson built without realising the lake was unusually low that year; because of his miscalculation, the Spiral Jetty has been submerged almost throughout its existence. People go on pilgrimages and come back saying they think they saw it.</p> <p>But this was more than a mistake. Smithson believed modern culture is psychotically unable to accept the existence of mortality. Conceptual art - of which Smithson was a key theorist - can be understood as a systematic attack on this culture of immortality, aka capitalism, with its need to believe that commodities are infinitely renewable and markets go on forever. \"Many would like to forget time altogether,\" wrote Smithson, \"because it contains the 'death principle'.\" Conceptual art takes the odd forms it does - rotting sharks, lumps of fat, vanishing earthworks - as an attack on this illusion. When you buy such a work of art, it doesn't matter if you are as rich as Saatchi because what you are buying is an emblem of your own mortality.</p> <p>This radical perishability has been relished by conceptual artists ever since Marcel Duchamp exhibited a urinal at a New York art exhibition in 1917. Duchamp made no attempt to preserve his urinal or any of the other \"readymades\" he exhibited around the time of the first world war, from a shovel to a bicycle wheel on a stool. When he became revered in the 60s, all his famous, iconic works had to be reconstructed because they had long since been thrown in the bin. Duchamp's masterpiece, The Bride Stripped Bare By Her Bachelors, Even, is a monument to time and fragility; when this large decorated glass panel was being transported from an exhibition in 1927, it was accidentally smashed to pieces. Duchamp hailed the breakage as a \"chance completion\" and although he meticulously reconstructed it, he did not attempt to hide the cracks and splinters, which are now part of its meaning (and what stops the Tate's replica being the original).</p> <p>Some conceptual artworks are easier to own than others. Turner Prize nominee Tomoko Takahashi's installations of broken clocks, disgorged electronic circuits and loose wiring may look unwieldy, but for selling purposes they can be divided up into small, convenient chunks. If you want to own a work by leading artist Martin Creed all you have to buy is the text that describes it and that is, technically, the work. But what do you do once you buy Creed's most famous work of art to date, Work 201, Half the Air in a Given Space?</p> <p>The lucky owner of this work gets the text, and the right to have the work installed. To install Work 201 you measure the air in a room, inflate large coloured balloons to consume exactly half that air, and that's your artwork. Obviously, it decays even more quickly than an improperly preserved shark. The more people enjoy the balloons, the quicker it all goes pop. Pop, pop, pop. That's the sound of time passing. In the end there's nothing but bits of torn rubber.</p> <p>Creed's balloon installation is an emblem of mortality in the same way as a firework display or the aftermath of a party. Unlike Saatchi's shark, however, this art is easy to renew. You just inflate more balloons. The work can be owned forever - what you buy is an idea.</p> <p>The Catholic church might wish Leonardo da Vinci had just issued them with a text describing the Last Supper, instead of painting it in unstable oil paints. Leonardo's wall painting in the refectory of the church of Santa Marie delle Grazie in Milan only exists today as a trace, a ghost of a painting; he used his own experimental methods instead of proper fresco techniques and so his painting is woefully mortal.</p> <p>Art has always been perishable. Paintings disintegrate, colours fade - as the regular rows over whether paintings are saved or ruined by restorers show, we do not really know what any of the great European paintings looked like when they were first shown, not even the ones that survive, because colours fade over time.</p> <p>The most revered artist in the Renaissance was Apelles, an ancient Greek painter none of whose works survived much beyond his own lifetime, and artists down the centuries have tried to recreate his works entirely from textual accounts. This is the supreme instance of the mortality of art, proof that the only perfect and timeless work of art is the one that has already disappeared forever.</p>",

The Home Office-funded research will conclude that drug-assisted rape is definitely on the increase but is not an epidemic. It will call for tighter controls on some of the drugs known to be used in rape cases and will make a series of recommendations designed to promote greater cooperation among the agencies involved in handling cases of drug-assisted rapes and to improve criminal investigations to ensure successful convictions. For while the government has admitted that drug-assisted rape is the fastest growing recorded crime against women, as yet there have been only a handful of convictions here compared with 1,000 in the US.</p> <p>One helpline says it received 757 calls last year from people claiming they had been drugged and raped - a sharp increase from 507 in 1998. But according to women's rights campaigners, drug rape is nothing new. \"Men have always drugged and raped women,\" says Julie Bindel of Justice for Women. \"It's nothing new. These drugs just make it a little bit easier for them.\"</p> <p>Peter Sturman, the Metropolitan police officer who led the research, spent more than a year travelling all over the UK, interviewing 123 victims of drug-assisted rape, as well as visiting America and Australia. He has since set up, with his wife, a charity called the Drug Rape Trust and has been rewarded for his efforts with a promotion to the rank of detective chief inspector. What he wants to see now, he says, is a more \"victim-driven\" approach.</p> <p>Sue Lees, professor of women's studies and rape trial expert, recently interviewed a victim of a suspected drug-assisted attack who had passed out after a couple of drinks and came round while she was being assaulted. It took three or four months to get the forensic results back - after which it emerged that she had been raped by three different men. No evidence of drugs has yet been established. According to Lees, the forensic services are hopelessly underfunded and ill-equipped to cope with what appears to be a growing crime.</p> <p>There is powerful evidence, she says, particularly in the US where the problem is more widespread, of organised drug-assisted rape. \"Watching your drink is something you have to do nowadays. There's a lot on the net about drug-assisted rape in the States and there are some sophisticated serial rapists around.\"</p> <p>But it's not fair and not enough always to put on women the burden of responsibility for protecting themselves. According to Lees, what is needed is a specialist police unit that can handle the forensic analysis involved in investigating drug-assisted rape and can deal sympathetically and skilfully with the women who come forward with complaints.</p> <p>Betsy Stanko, professor of criminology, first gave lectures to police at Hendon training college 20 years ago. \"There's been a fairly substantial turnaround in the Metropolitan police about how important it is to take sexual violence seriously,\" she says. \"But the way they've dealt with that is to issue warnings - if there's a rape by a minicab driver, they say don't go in minicabs until we catch him. We end up never discussing what should be discussed: why men want to rape women. We are accepting a natural predatory state of maleness and letting men off the hook again.\"</p> <p>Stanko is not exercised by the rise in drug-assisted rape. \"I know there's been a lot of discussion about it, particularly in the US. Much of it focuses on the evilness of the drug, rather than the man using it,\" she points out, \"which is very strange because it's not the drug that's evil. It's another variation, a new technology that assists men to commit sexual violence. There will always be new technologies that will do that.\"</p> <p>Research by Zero Tolerance, the Edinburgh-based group that campaigns against domestic and sexual violence, suggests that one in two young men thinks raping a woman is acceptable in certain circumstances. \"So some of them carry pills,\" Stanko says. \"But quite frankly, drugs are not doing the raping. They may be doing some form of disarmament, but not the raping. The boys are doing that.\"</p> <p>Whether the Sturman report will make any real difference when a woman comes to report a suspected drug rape remains to be seen. At a time when conviction rates for reported rapes are at an all-time low of 6%, it's certainly a tall order. Getting a conviction for a rape that does not involve drugs is hard enough; if the woman has little or no memory because she was drugged, it must be nigh-on impossible.</p> <p>Who was it that said a life lived in fear is a life wasted? If we go on a night out, we can appoint someone to guard our drinks; we can clutch our beer bottles to us and never accept a drink from a stranger. The Sturman report has to be welcomed, but what will really make a difference for women is a seismic shift in the way the criminal justice system responds to rape - drug-assisted or not.</p>",

One helpline says it received 757 calls last year from people claiming they had been drugged and raped - a sharp increase from 507 in 1998. But according to women's rights campaigners, drug rape is nothing new. \"Men have always drugged and raped women,\" says Julie Bindel of Justice for Women. \"It's nothing new. These drugs just make it a little bit easier for them.\" Peter Sturman, the Metropolitan police officer who led the research, spent more than a year travelling all over the UK, interviewing 123 victims of drug-assisted rape, as well as visiting America and Australia. He has since set up, with his wife, a charity called the Drug Rape Trust and has been rewarded for his efforts with a promotion to the rank of detective chief inspector. What he wants to see now, he says, is a more \"victim-driven\" approach. Sue Lees, professor of women's studies and rape trial expert, recently interviewed a victim of a suspected drug-assisted attack who had passed out after a couple of drinks and came round while she was being assaulted. It took three or four months to get the forensic results back - after which it emerged that she had been raped by three different men. No evidence of drugs has yet been established. According to Lees, the forensic services are hopelessly underfunded and ill-equipped to cope with what appears to be a growing crime. There is powerful evidence, she says, particularly in the US where the problem is more widespread, of organised drug-assisted rape. \"Watching your drink is something you have to do nowadays. There's a lot on the net about drug-assisted rape in the States and there are some sophisticated serial rapists around.\" But it's not fair and not enough always to put on women the burden of responsibility for protecting themselves. According to Lees, what is needed is a specialist police unit that can handle the forensic analysis involved in investigating drug-assisted rape and can deal sympathetically and skilfully with the women who come forward with complaints. Betsy Stanko, professor of criminology, first gave lectures to police at Hendon training college 20 years ago. \"There's been a fairly substantial turnaround in the Metropolitan police about how important it is to take sexual violence seriously,\" she says. \"But the way they've dealt with that is to issue warnings - if there's a rape by a minicab driver, they say don't go in minicabs until we catch him. We end up never discussing what should be discussed: why men want to rape women. We are accepting a natural predatory state of maleness and letting men off the hook again.\" Stanko is not exercised by the rise in drug-assisted rape. \"I know there's been a lot of discussion about it, particularly in the US. Much of it focuses on the evilness of the drug, rather than the man using it,\" she points out, \"which is very strange because it's not the drug that's evil. It's another variation, a new technology that assists men to commit sexual violence. There will always be new technologies that will do that.\" Research by Zero Tolerance, the Edinburgh-based group that campaigns against domestic and sexual violence, suggests that one in two young men thinks raping a woman is acceptable in certain circumstances. \"So some of them carry pills,\" Stanko says. \"But quite frankly, drugs are not doing the raping. They may be doing some form of disarmament, but not the raping. The boys are doing that.\" Whether the Sturman report will make any real difference when a woman comes to report a suspected drug rape remains to be seen. At a time when conviction rates for reported rapes are at an all-time low of 6%, it's certainly a tall order. Getting a conviction for a rape that does not involve drugs is hard enough; if the woman has little or no memory because she was drugged, it must be nigh-on impossible. Who was it that said a life lived in fear is a life wasted? If we go on a night out, we can appoint someone to guard our drinks; we can clutch our beer bottles to us and never accept a drink from a stranger. The Sturman report has to be welcomed, but what will really make a difference for women is a seismic shift in the way the criminal justice system responds to rape - drug-assisted or not.",

It was just over 18 months ago and probably the darkest hour of the House's closure, with ballet and opera staff panicking about a complete shutdown. </p> <p>But for Kaiser, the legendary Mr Fix-It of arts organisations, it could hardly have been better. Recalling that day in his immaculately ordered office, Kaiser insists: \"I love problems. I love solving problems.\" And, looking back over the past successful season, he has done a classy job in sorting out the problems at the House. A few rumbles persist over ticket pricing and the malfunctioning stage machinery that jinxed the House's reopening, but the new building is slowly becoming an object of affection. </p> <p>Kaiser is proud that the House's historic deficit has been paid off and that, against all expectation, the organisation broke even in the last financial year. Some ticket prices were cut and 40% of the audience during Kaiser's first season had apparently never visited the House before. </p> <p>The staff seem happier, too. When he arrived, Kaiser says, the House \"was in a state typical of troubled organisations everywhere. There was a lack of clear roles and people didn't know who was running the show.\" Now he believes almost everyone in the building \"feels they have a vital role\". </p> <p>All this sounds like the triumph of some iron-willed troubleshooter, but Kaiser's story is more complex. His steady exterior is known to shelter a shy, emotional personality and it has been widely rumoured that he felt so browbeaten by the hostile British press, the politics within the House and the monumental labours of getting it reopened that he planned to resign at the end of this season. Kaiser tackles the claim head-on. \"I expect you've heard all the rumours about my resigning,\" he says cheerfully, and goes on to say how seriously exhausted he is. </p> <p>He came to Britain straight after leaving the American Ballet Theatre in New York, where he had spent three years turning the company around. Once here, he worked from 6am to midnight every day overseeing the myriad aspects of the reopening, from the new bar staff to the heating systems and the temperamental stage machinery. Asked what his doctor thinks, Kaiser, aged 46, shrugs. \"Oh, I don't even have to go see him. I could just play the record: 'Get more rest... take a holiday... get more exercise... lose weight...'\" </p> <p>While Kaiser was slogging his guts out - along with fellow staff and board members, to whom he is quick to give equal credit - the press didn't stop hurling mud, and although he accepts that the House requires public monitoring, his frustration over the number of misleading and badly informed stories fuelled a desire to leave. </p> <p>Now, though, he has signed up for another season - but for one only. This, he insists, is not a signal of his definite departure in 2001, only of his refusal to commit longer term, but it surely puts a question mark over the future. The board may not have to scrabble around for a replacement just yet, but there's a danger that Kaiser's temporising may unsettle the balance he has laboured to create. He could be gone before either the new ballet director, Ross Stretton, or the new music director, Antony Pappano, start their jobs. </p> <p>Kaiser counters this by insisting that both men are already talking to staff at the House. And, he points out, he never works on a long term contract. Again, he offers his candour like an embrace - \"Let me share a part of my emotional life with you\"- confiding that he always burns out at the end of a season, and has to be sure he can regenerate himself before committing to another. He says, self-mockingly, that it wouldn't help any organisation for him to stay after the big issues were sorted, because he would start meddling with affairs that weren't his concern. </p> <p>This might suggest Kaiser has a fear of commitment - that he gets excited by crises but lacks the staying power for daily, domestic detail. Yet this isn't exactly the case. Like a man showing photos of his children, he says that he keeps close contact with the companies where he has previously worked. Even more significant is the interest he takes in the working lives of his artists. As executive director, his style is neither bland suit nor flamboyant politician, but an idiosyncratic mix of amateur enthusiast and philanthropist. </p> <p>It is a matter of pride to him that he can talk to artists intelligently about their work. And one reason why his days are so long is that he opts to watch most performances and discuss them with the performers. Before becoming an arts manager he trained as an opera singer - \"My voice was terrible\" - and he also took ballet classes for a year. He loves the joke of how unlike a dancer he looks. He beams plumply that he had \"great turn out\" but never got the hang of turning: \"I kept going into the wall.\" </p> <p>More hours are eaten up by his special interest, the development of new work, especially dance. When he agreed to join the House, Kaiser was fired by the promise of the Clore Studio and Linbury Theatre, small-scale facilities that would allow choreographers to make works away from the demands of the main auditorium. It scares him how expensive it has become to create ballets for today's big companies and how damaging this is to choreographers' development. \"Ashton or Balanchine could create four or five works a year and think nothing of it,\" he says, \"but today's choreographers can often only make one. It's become much harder for them to mature, to learn from their mistakes.\" </p> <p>The Royal Ballet's New Works season is thus very close to his heart. It presents a mix of ballets by established choreographers and younger artists, and Kaiser hopes that its varied line-up and low ticket prices should \"get different parts of the dance audience into the House, create links, and allow the company to loosen up a little.\" </p> <p>It is, though, only the first move in a much larger push towards experiment. In collaboration with dancer Deborah Bull, Kaiser has created a timetable for choreographers, inside and outside the company, to develop work in the Clore Studio during the year, and a system to provide them with structured feedback. He thinks there's a critical lack of education among choreographers and believes there are some \"wonderful minds in England who could come in and share their experience\". </p> <p>His prime motive is to widen the pool of artists able to create ballets for the Royal, but he takes a keen interest in the whole UK dance scene. He watches a range of smaller modern dance companies and is shocked by the talent wasted through poor management and underfunding. So he is helping two independent choreographers, Matthew Hawkins and Sheron Wray, teaching them about fundraising and marketing. The couple have been paired with two Royal dancers who are working as unpaid administrators (and, incidentally, picking up training for their own post-dancing careers). </p> <p>Kaiser says simply: \"It's painful to me to see talent being wasted because of a lack of support.\" And he is adamant it will continue after him. \"You create a damaging lack of trust if you just do a little then take it away.\" </p> <p>All this is genuine, big-hearted stuff, and though Kaiser may be driven by a private as well as a public agenda, there's no denying the infectiousness of his vision. It may be an accident of timing that he has led the House into the 21st century. But his dogged hopefulness is helping it to feel that it belongs there. </p> <p>The New Works season is in rep at the Linbury Studio (020-7304 4000) till July 2.</p>",

      "body": "<p>This year's New Contemporaries, the annual exhibition of students and recent graduates selected from Britain's art colleges, serves as a warning of what might happen to British art in the next 10 years. If the star in the 90s was the artist, now it is the museum. We live in an age of great exhibitions rather than great artists. But although we can live with curators imposing their vision on art history, what happens when they do the same with new art, and young artists are rewarded for second-guessing what might fit into a group show? There is no room for solitary brilliance. </p> <p>When Damien Hirst showed his shark at the Saatchi Gallery in 1991, it had nothing in common with anything around it. Everything in New Contemporaries 2000 - supposedly a showcase of new talent - conforms to a preconceived idea of what art should be. This show is pleasant as a whole, weak in particulars, with no single work that takes your breath away. But art that takes your breath away is the only art you need. </p> <p>This is not to say the very young artists in this exhibition are talentless, but there's something overbearing about the way the exhibition has been selected and the portrait it claims to paint of new art. This does not feel like an open exhibition, although it is one, with the selectors - critic Sarah Kent, artist Gavin Turk and curator Jeremy Millar - examining slides without any knowledge of the artist's name or college. </p> <p>Entering the new Milton Keynes Gallery, it is immediately impossible to see this as anything other than a heavily curated group show exploring a specific theme: landscape, introspection, romantic inwardness. Almost everything here, from Justin Carter's Mobile Retreat, a portable tent/art studio in which he shelters in the wild and draws nature, to Josephine Butler's photographs of overgrown countryside, entitled City of London, touches on the inward life of the rural rambler. And you thought young artists spent their time in bars in Shoreditch... </p> <p>Why does this open exhibition have such a strong theme? It might just be that art students are all obsessed with alpine kitsch and horse-riding. But I smell a curator. Millar, the brightest spark on this year's selection panel, has strong ideas about what he likes. He likes JG Ballard, American land artist Robert Smithson, Tacita Dean and the idea of entropy - of time running down and the art work running down with it. The huge amount of art here that exudes pastoral melancholy has his signature all over it. </p> <p>A life-size wooden outline of a cable car by an artist identified only as Eric stands next to Jeff Ty Lee's intricate drawings of mountain scenery. Jennifer Beattie's Beautiful Trees (real uprooted trees with paper leaves) hang in front of Andrew Mania's wall-filling installation with werewolf-like figures and pastiched portraits and, dominating everything, a series of - you guessed it - mountain landscape paintings with a cute little ladder down to the ground. </p> <p>Mania's installation is too aware of its own fine insanity to be convincing - the problem with a lot of the art here. When it comes to painting and drawing, young artists seem to expect their works to be seen in quotation marks as \"paintings\" or \"drawings\" - like Edward Weldon with his painting of Concorde without its nose. Ho ho. </p> <p>Then there are pictorial tableaux, like Mick Peter's blue-painted Alpine house with sinister megaphone, or James Ireland's picture-postcard landscape with a \"real\" waterfall consisting of tap water running into a bucket. So dreamy, so self-consciously pathetic. These art works are overloaded with attitude, with ideas about nature and what we do to it. If they like nature so much, why don't they go and live there? </p> <p>This exhibition is full of people striking attitudes - a natural student activity - but instead of keeping pretension in check, the selectors have rewarded every cool posture. This landscape stuff shrivels next to Smithson, who built Spiral Jetty, a vast earthwork that slowly sank into Salt Lake. Ilana Halperin photographs herself boiling some milk in a Scandinavian hot spring. Beata Veszely makes model heads of horses you can wear. These works are too easily translated into words and conscious of their weirdness. </p> <p>In another context all this art might look much better. Here the artists who stand out are the ones whose work does not fit. Art that is not pictorial, that does not have an instantly decodable meaning, is like a fresh spring in this overcurated wilderness. Melanie Titmuss has drawn in pencil around the perimeter of a huge sheet of paper, and then cut away the paper. The grey rectangle on the wall, snaking out over the floor, shares some of the humour of the 60s postminimalist artist Eva Hesse in the way it plays on order and chaos. Marta Marce's paintings don't namecheck anyone, or picture anything, or evoke a mood. In one of them blackness radiates across the canvas. This is odd. The painting does not rush to tell you what it is about. Another painting resembles a multicoloured Scalextric set_ no, it doesn't resemble anything but the movements Marce made as she painted around cans placed on the canvas. I kept coming back to it, and it looked better every time. </p> <p>Britain's love affair with modern art has never really been about the artists, but about what we get from looking at and arguing about their work. But as the catalogue essay for New Contemporaries gratuitously puts it, \"Really, the work would not be there without those that make it.\" And if curators and selectors become the dominant force in the age of Tate Modern we may wander through our beautiful new public galleries without ever coming across that unplanned, unexpected, astonishing thing we were looking for. </p> <p>New Contemporaries 2000 is at Milton Keynes Gallery (01908 676 900) till August 13.</p>",

Ilana Halperin photographs herself boiling some milk in a Scandinavian hot spring. Beata Veszely makes model heads of horses you can wear. These works are too easily translated into words and conscious of their weirdness. In another context all this art might look much better. Here the artists who stand out are the ones whose work does not fit. Art that is not pictorial, that does not have an instantly decodable meaning, is like a fresh spring in this overcurated wilderness. Melanie Titmuss has drawn in pencil around the perimeter of a huge sheet of paper, and then cut away the paper. The grey rectangle on the wall, snaking out over the floor, shares some of the humour of the 60s postminimalist artist Eva Hesse in the way it plays on order and chaos. Marta Marce's paintings don't namecheck anyone, or picture anything, or evoke a mood. In one of them blackness radiates across the canvas. This is odd. The painting does not rush to tell you what it is about. Another painting resembles a multicoloured Scalextric set_ no, it doesn't resemble anything but the movements Marce made as she painted around cans placed on the canvas. I kept coming back to it, and it looked better every time. Britain's love affair with modern art has never really been about the artists, but about what we get from looking at and arguing about their work. But as the catalogue essay for New Contemporaries gratuitously puts it, \"Really, the work would not be there without those that make it.\" And if curators and selectors become the dominant force in the age of Tate Modern we may wander through our beautiful new public galleries without ever coming across that unplanned, unexpected, astonishing thing we were looking for. New Contemporaries 2000 is at Milton Keynes Gallery (01908 676 900) till August 13.",

This year's Turner shortlist - Japanese artist Tomoko Takahashi, German photographer Wolfgang Tillmans, Dutch painter Michael Raedecker and lone Brit Glenn Brown - has already raised attention with its inclusion of three artists who are not British but live and work here. \"I thought it was meant for British artists,\" one peeved contender who failed to make the final four said last week. I found this reaction a bit unsettling. Art has never respected borders. </p> <p>Medieval and Renaissance artists moved from court to court. Artists as well as their works migrate from city to city, taking up residencies, setting up stall in the art fairs and museums of the world. Everywhere is local, everywhere is international. </p> <p>Ten days ago a show of works by artists shortlisted for a new European art prize, the Vincent, was launched at the Bonnefantenmuseum in Maastricht in Holland. The Vincent, worth 50,000 euros (\u00a332,000), emulates the Turner, down to the appointment of Nicholas Serota as chair of the judging panel, which includes Swiss artists Fischli and Weiss, and Italian artist Luciano Fabro. The winner will be announced in September. </p> <p>\"In a world of global culture, individual countries no longer set the standards,\" writes the Bonnefanten's director, Alexander van Grevenstein, \"and although there is no other continent that demonstrates so many views and self-inflicted differences, the Vincent is not designed to celebrate Europe's pre-eminent status, but rather to celebrate diversity.\" </p> <p>The Vincent shortlist comprises Antwerp painter Luc Tuymans, Carsten Holler (Belgian-born, residing in Cologne), Warsaw sculptor Miroslaw Balka, film-maker Eija Liisa Ahtila from Helsinki, Lisbon artist Pedro Cabrita Reis and London-based, Nigerian-born film and installation artist Oladele Ajiboye Bamgboye. Cities are more important in Europe than countries. But at the press conference - attended mostly by Dutch critics and journalists - the question why there were no Dutch artists was foremost, predictably anticipating the peevish xenophobia in the complaints over this year's Turner line-up. </p> <p>The Vincent is a terrific group show, even though the artists were not selected with a theme in mind. Ahtila's film installations manage to be arresting as environments and also maintain strong narrative drive, even though she refers to one work here as a \"sketch\". One of her multi-screen projections (an apt word) is displayed in a kind of analyst's room. You can lie on a couch, hear unseen voices, feel that you are projecting your own fantasies. Of Bamgboye's two video works, one was shot from a pay-to-view porn channel in a Canadian hotel, to which the artist declined to subscribe: fragments of bodies swoon amid the scrambled signals. Bamgboye will be seen at Tate Britain next month, in a show called Intelligence. The Vincent is more about the long-term vitality of an artist's work than it is about the novelty of this year's model. The show reflects this, even though Ahtila and Bamgboye have yet to develop a mature style. </p> <p>Carsten Holler is the joker. His Giant Psycho Tank is a big, waxy white polypropylene bathing unit. You can float in a pool of heated water made twice as salty as the Dead Sea: so saline, you can almost walk on it. I declined a dip. His is a kind of psychological chamber, as is one of the two rooms dedicated to Miroslaw Balka. Familiar Balka elements - a head-high hawser (part of which is wrapped in human hair) crossing the space; an athlete's exercise bar below it, indented to accept an arm, a neck or a leg; a metal grille-like door leading nowhere - are arrayed around the room. On the floor is a grey box. In the box is a perfect mock-up of the room you are in, and its contents. Looking down into the box, you feel as if human scale has been somehow altered, like Alice presented with the bottle labelled Drink Me. </p> <p>Pedro Cabrita Reis has hacked out the doorways to his room, and leant the wrecked plasterboard and door frames against the wall. He made a similar work in the new Serralves Museum in Oporto some months back. This particular series of works - leaving the architecture in a state of arrest between building and demolition, clean and dirty, finished and unfinished - is undoubtedly a metaphor for the creative process and the relation between the artist and the gallery. He is the only artist here never to have shown in Britain. </p> <p>Luc Tuymans is well known, and one of the best painters working anywhere today. His small, history-laden, metaphoric and frequently nasty paintings are all about European-ness. Whether he is painting a dozing Nazi, a landscape, a corner of a bed or a fragment of a packet of Ecover soap powder, you know he has something furtive and unsettling in mind. </p> <p>He is one of those artists I return to again and again, in the way one returns to certain poets, novelists, film-makers. They always give you the same story, whatever the imagery, the same emotional tenor, the same slant on the world. Their power depends on the richness of their language, how well they sustain their vision, the degree to which we want to return to them. These, surely, are the criteria. This, rather than nationality, is what we should care about, and attend to. If this is what the Vincent continues to be about, it deserves to succeed. </p> <p>The Vincent shortlist is at the Bonnefantenmuseum, Maastricht (00 31 43 329 01900), till September 24.</p>",

But they deserve more than squashing. They are very good at what they do and their blood-sucking is only a part of a fascinating life-cycle. </p> <p> <strong> Do all mosquitoes and midges feed on human blood?</strong> </p> <p> No, for many mosquitoes and midges human blood is not the food of first choice. Not all mosquitoes need blood; some prefer specific animals such as birds, horses or cattle, and some will feed on almost anything. There are about 30 varieties of mosquito and hundreds of species of midge in Britain. The commonest British mozzie is called Culex pipens and it rarely bites people. Non-biting midges outnumber biters by over two to one. </p> <p>Male mosquitoes and midges are harmless - they eat nectar from plants. The females need the blood before they can lay eggs, although some can lay their first batch without blood, so their survival is guaranteed. </p> <p> <strong> How can you tell male and female midges and mosquitoes apart?</strong> </p> <p> The males have feathery feelers (antennae). Male mosquitoes also make less noise. The females beat their wings about 400 times a second and create that characteristic whine. </p> <p> <strong> Is it dangerous to be bitten by a mosquito or midge?</strong> </p> <p> In many parts of the world it can be. Mosquitoes carry some of the planet's deadliest diseases, including malaria and yellow fever. It is estimated that over 400m people catch malaria every year and that nearly 2m people die as a result. </p> <p>We are lucky in Britain. We only have four kinds of anopheline mosquito - the kind that can carry human malaria. But don't think you have to stay inside all summer. Malaria has died out in this country. Many of the wetlands which mosquitoes like have been drained and the temperatures here are too cold for the parasite that causes the malaria to survive. </p> <p>It was not always so. Shakespeare is full of mentions of the \"ague\" and Oliver Cromwell may have died from the disease. Nowadays, the only outbreaks of malaria in Europe have occurred near airports thanks to infected mosquitoes hitching a lift here on aeroplanes. </p> <p> <strong> Can you tell which mosquitoes are the anophelines?</strong> </p> <p> At rest or when feeding, anopheline mosquitoes raise their tails in the air, while Culex mosquitoes hold their body parallel to the surface on which they stand. </p> <p> <strong> How do mosquitoes and midges suck our blood?</strong> </p> <p>Mosquito mouthparts are perfect for the job. They are needle-sharp. Mosquito and midge saliva contain chemicals that stop the blood from clotting so they can keep feeding. Mosquitoes also inject a kind of anaesthetic into us so we can't feel what is going on. Our bodies' immune system fights these chemicals and itchy lumps come up where we have been bitten. </p> <p>Midges are less sophisticated. We can feel their bites because they have to saw their way into our skin with their stubby mouth-parts. Their advantage is that they are silent and small. In North America they are known as \"noseeums\". </p> <p> <strong> Are some people more attractive to mosquitoes and midges?</strong> </p> <p> Yes. Midges and mosquitoes seem to be attracted to the carbon dioxide gas we breathe out. They are also drawn to heat and to sweat. Research just out suggests that pregnant women are bitten more often - perhaps because they are generally hotter and smell differently or maybe because they have to get up more in the night. </p> <p> <strong> How can you learn more?</strong> </p> <p> You can find Culex pipens mosquito eggs and larvae in standing water - rainwater butts are a good place to look. Eggs can be found from April onwards forming rafts on the water surface. Collect them, keep them in a jar of water and watch their life cycle. Feed the larvae on small amounts of fish food, baby food or any other protein diet. When the mosquitoes appear, give them a stick to rest on and see if you can tell the males and the females apart. Put a few small holes in the top of the jar and place your hand over them. The females should fly up, attracted by the smell. It is not a good idea to let them feed on you! </p> <p>There are mosquitoes and midges in literature. DH Lawrence wrote a poem to a mosquito, although he gets it wrong and calls the insect biting him \"monsieur\". John Keats writes about \"a wailful choir\" of small gnats in his Ode to Autumn. </p> <p> <strong> Can you find any other references?</strong> </p> <p> There are many midge, mosquito and malaria sites online.</p> <p>\u0095 Search through the <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/\">article archives</a></p> <p>Malaria is explained at <a href=\"http://www.anopheles.com/lifec.html\">www.anopheles.com</a>.

M\u00e1s de doscientas asociaciones c\u00edvicas criticaron el desfile militar del 27 de mayo en Barcelona. Seg\u00fan ellos, era un \"acto de apolog\u00eda militarista y de ostentaci\u00f3n de armas\". </p> <p>Y contestaron la parada militar en Barcelona con la organizaci\u00f3n de un Festival por la Paz. El desfile fue contemplado por 20.000 personas. El Festival por la Paz reuni\u00f3 a 45.000 personas. </p> <p>Cu\u00e1l es la funci\u00f3n y el futuro de los ej\u00e9rcitos en los pa\u00edses democr\u00e1ticos? Seg\u00fan el ministro de defensa del gobierno espa\u00f1ol, Federico Trillo, \"ninguna democracia avanzada ha renunciado a sus fuerzas armadas. Cuando el sistema pol\u00edtico es democr\u00e1tico y representativo, las Fuerzas Armadas defienden un Estado que representa a todos. Su tarea es la defensa de la comunidad\". El ministro tambi\u00e9n defiende la contribuci\u00f3n del ej\u00e9rcito espa\u00f1ol \"a la paz de otros pueblos\". </p> <p> <strong> Est\u00e1s a favor de los desfiles militares? Por qu\u00e9? Crees que los militares deben desfilar en las procesiones religiosas de Semana Santa?</strong></p> <p><strong>Manuel Ort\u00edz </strong> tiene 18 a\u00f1os, vive en Madrid y es militante de las juventudes del Partido Popular, actualmente en el gobierno: Estoy a favor de los desfiles militares. Es una tradici\u00f3n, y estoy a favor de mantener las tradiciones. Adem\u00e1s en los desfiles la sociedad ve a d\u00f3nde va el dinero de sus impuestos. En cuanto a las procesiones de Semana Santa, por qu\u00e9 no? Si es un ej\u00e9rcito de paz, que tiene misiones humanitarias, entonces no hay contradicci\u00f3n. </p> <p> <strong> Alex P\u00e9rez </strong> tiene 17 a\u00f1os, vive en Barcelona y pertenece al grupo scout de Sant Cugat del Vall\u00e9s: Si un desfile es una demostraci\u00f3n de poder y de armas, entonces no estoy a favor. Yo particip\u00e9 en el Festival por la Paz celebrado en el parque de la Ciutadella el d\u00eda 27 de mayo. Mientras el ej\u00e9rcito desfilaba en otro lado de la ciudad. Un ej\u00e9rcito, en principio, es para defender a los ciudadanos. Pero en Espa\u00f1a, donde hay antecedentes de una dictadura militar, estos temas despiertan sensibilidades. Hay personas que interpretan el desfile militar por las calles de su ciudad como una amenaza al pueblo. En cuanto a las procesiones de Semana Santa, mezclar religi\u00f3n y armas es peligroso. </p> <p> <strong> Qu\u00e9 funci\u00f3n tiene hoy el ej\u00e9rcito espa\u00f1ol? Qu\u00e9 funci\u00f3n tienen los ej\u00e9rcitos en los pa\u00edses democr\u00e1ticos? </strong></p> <p><strong>Manuel Ort\u00edz: </strong> El ej\u00e9rcito es la instituci\u00f3n en Espa\u00f1a que m\u00e1s ha evolucionado desde la instauraci\u00f3n de la democracia. Se ha adaptado al nuevo sistema y se ha transformado en un ej\u00e9rcito de paz, que participa en misiones humanitarias. El ej\u00e9rcito defiende el sistema democr\u00e1tico, sistema que defiende la gran mayor\u00eda de la sociedad espa\u00f1ola. </p> <p>Adem\u00e1s, el ej\u00e9rcito hoy es nece sario para la protecci\u00f3n de los ciudadanos. Tenemos que ser realistas. Ning\u00fan pa\u00eds est\u00e1 libre de un posible ataque por parte de otros pa\u00edses. Tambi\u00e9n hemos visto la actuaci\u00f3n del ej\u00e9rcito en cat\u00e1strofes, cuando hay una situaci\u00f3n de alarma entre los ciudadanos, como inundaciones. Por \u00faltimo, el ej\u00e9rcito tiene una labor de formaci\u00f3n. Muchos j\u00f3venes que quieren estudiar aviaci\u00f3n o marina, por ejemplo, deciden entrar en el ej\u00e9rcito. Es el \u00fanico sistema para aprender a volar o navegar en un centro p\u00fablico. La alternativa es una escuela privada, donde cuesta unos ocho millones de pesetas. </p> <p> <strong> Alex P\u00e9rez: </strong> El ej\u00e9rcito tiene como funci\u00f3n principal defendernos de cualquier ataque. Las acciones humanitarias es algo que se han sacado de la manga ahora los ej\u00e9rcitos. Para la solidaridad internacional no hace falta un ej\u00e9rcito armado ni todo el dinero que cuesta. Si la misi\u00f3n principal es ayudar y construir una escuela, por ejemplo, lo pueden hacer personas que no est\u00e9n preparadas para la defensa. </p> <p> <strong> Crees que los ej\u00e9rcitos en los pa\u00edses democr\u00e1ticos deber\u00edan desaparecer en el futuro?</strong></p> <p><strong>Manuel Ort\u00edz: </strong> No. Creo que debemos ser realistas. Todos los pa\u00edses estamos expuestos a un posible conflicto b\u00e9lico, y el ej\u00e9rcito es el \u00fanico medio de protecci\u00f3n de los ciudadanos. Las inversiones en armas son para defender la vida de los ciudadanos. </p> <p> <strong> Alex P\u00e9rez: </strong> El ej\u00e9rcito representa guerra. Ser\u00eda mejor educar para que se respeten los derechos fundamentales. En Espa\u00f1a, por ejemplo, se dedican miles de millones al ej\u00e9rcito y en cambio mucho menos dinero a la educaci\u00f3n y a la sanidad. Los ej\u00e9rcitos deber\u00edan desaparecer y destinar sus presupuestos a educar en la paz. Este es el objetivo por el que deber\u00edamos luchar. En todo caso es dif\u00edcil que desaparezca el ej\u00e9rcito, al menos de momento. Pero entonces yo prefiero un ej\u00e9rcito de la Otan (Organizaci\u00f3n del Tratado del Atl\u00e1ntico Norte) en vez de un conjunto de ej\u00e9rcitos nacionales. </p> <p><strong>Glosario/Glossary</strong></p> <p> <strong> la amenaza</strong> threat <br><strong> las armas</strong> weapons <br><strong> el desfile</strong> parade <br><strong> los impuestos</strong> taxes <br><strong> peligroso</strong> dangerous <br><strong> el presupuesto</strong> budget <br><strong> rodeado </strong> surrounded <br><strong> sacarse de la manga</strong> to pull out of the hat (lit. sleeve) <br><strong> la sensibilidad</strong> sensitivity</p>",

M\u00e1s de doscientas asociaciones c\u00edvicas criticaron el desfile militar del 27 de mayo en Barcelona. Seg\u00fan ellos, era un \"acto de apolog\u00eda militarista y de ostentaci\u00f3n de armas\". Y contestaron la parada militar en Barcelona con la organizaci\u00f3n de un Festival por la Paz. El desfile fue contemplado por 20.000 personas. El Festival por la Paz reuni\u00f3 a 45.000 personas. Cu\u00e1l es la funci\u00f3n y el futuro de los ej\u00e9rcitos en los pa\u00edses democr\u00e1ticos? Seg\u00fan el ministro de defensa del gobierno espa\u00f1ol, Federico Trillo, \"ninguna democracia avanzada ha renunciado a sus fuerzas armadas. Cuando el sistema pol\u00edtico es democr\u00e1tico y representativo, las Fuerzas Armadas defienden un Estado que representa a todos. Su tarea es la defensa de la comunidad\". El ministro tambi\u00e9n defiende la contribuci\u00f3n del ej\u00e9rcito espa\u00f1ol \"a la paz de otros pueblos\". Est\u00e1s a favor de los desfiles militares? Por qu\u00e9? Crees que los militares deben desfilar en las procesiones religiosas de Semana Santa? Manuel Ort\u00edz tiene 18 a\u00f1os, vive en Madrid y es militante de las juventudes del Partido Popular, actualmente en el gobierno: Estoy a favor de los desfiles militares. Es una tradici\u00f3n, y estoy a favor de mantener las tradiciones. Adem\u00e1s en los desfiles la sociedad ve a d\u00f3nde va el dinero de sus impuestos. En cuanto a las procesiones de Semana Santa, por qu\u00e9 no? Si es un ej\u00e9rcito de paz, que tiene misiones humanitarias, entonces no hay contradicci\u00f3n. Alex P\u00e9rez tiene 17 a\u00f1os, vive en Barcelona y pertenece al grupo scout de Sant Cugat del Vall\u00e9s: Si un desfile es una demostraci\u00f3n de poder y de armas, entonces no estoy a favor. Yo particip\u00e9 en el Festival por la Paz celebrado en el parque de la Ciutadella el d\u00eda 27 de mayo. Mientras el ej\u00e9rcito desfilaba en otro lado de la ciudad. Un ej\u00e9rcito, en principio, es para defender a los ciudadanos. Pero en Espa\u00f1a, donde hay antecedentes de una dictadura militar, estos temas despiertan sensibilidades. Hay personas que interpretan el desfile militar por las calles de su ciudad como una amenaza al pueblo. En cuanto a las procesiones de Semana Santa, mezclar religi\u00f3n y armas es peligroso. Qu\u00e9 funci\u00f3n tiene hoy el ej\u00e9rcito espa\u00f1ol? Qu\u00e9 funci\u00f3n tienen los ej\u00e9rcitos en los pa\u00edses democr\u00e1ticos? Manuel Ort\u00edz: El ej\u00e9rcito es la instituci\u00f3n en Espa\u00f1a que m\u00e1s ha evolucionado desde la instauraci\u00f3n de la democracia. Se ha adaptado al nuevo sistema y se ha transformado en un ej\u00e9rcito de paz, que participa en misiones humanitarias. El ej\u00e9rcito defiende el sistema democr\u00e1tico, sistema que defiende la gran mayor\u00eda de la sociedad espa\u00f1ola. Adem\u00e1s, el ej\u00e9rcito hoy es nece sario para la protecci\u00f3n de los ciudadanos. Tenemos que ser realistas. Ning\u00fan pa\u00eds est\u00e1 libre de un posible ataque por parte de otros pa\u00edses. Tambi\u00e9n hemos visto la actuaci\u00f3n del ej\u00e9rcito en cat\u00e1strofes, cuando hay una situaci\u00f3n de alarma entre los ciudadanos, como inundaciones. Por \u00faltimo, el ej\u00e9rcito tiene una labor de formaci\u00f3n. Muchos j\u00f3venes que quieren estudiar aviaci\u00f3n o marina, por ejemplo, deciden entrar en el ej\u00e9rcito. Es el \u00fanico sistema para aprender a volar o navegar en un centro p\u00fablico. La alternativa es una escuela privada, donde cuesta unos ocho millones de pesetas. Alex P\u00e9rez: El ej\u00e9rcito tiene como funci\u00f3n principal defendernos de cualquier ataque. Las acciones humanitarias es algo que se han sacado de la manga ahora los ej\u00e9rcitos. Para la solidaridad internacional no hace falta un ej\u00e9rcito armado ni todo el dinero que cuesta. Si la misi\u00f3n principal es ayudar y construir una escuela, por ejemplo, lo pueden hacer personas que no est\u00e9n preparadas para la defensa. Crees que los ej\u00e9rcitos en los pa\u00edses democr\u00e1ticos deber\u00edan desaparecer en el futuro? Manuel Ort\u00edz: No. Creo que debemos ser realistas. Todos los pa\u00edses estamos expuestos a un posible conflicto b\u00e9lico, y el ej\u00e9rcito es el \u00fanico medio de protecci\u00f3n de los ciudadanos. Las inversiones en armas son para defender la vida de los ciudadanos. Alex P\u00e9rez: El ej\u00e9rcito representa guerra. Ser\u00eda mejor educar para que se respeten los derechos fundamentales. En Espa\u00f1a, por ejemplo, se dedican miles de millones al ej\u00e9rcito y en cambio mucho menos dinero a la educaci\u00f3n y a la sanidad. Los ej\u00e9rcitos deber\u00edan desaparecer y destinar sus presupuestos a educar en la paz. Este es el objetivo por el que deber\u00edamos luchar. En todo caso es dif\u00edcil que desaparezca el ej\u00e9rcito, al menos de momento. Pero entonces yo prefiero un ej\u00e9rcito de la Otan (Organizaci\u00f3n del Tratado del Atl\u00e1ntico Norte) en vez de un conjunto de ej\u00e9rcitos nacionales.

      "body": "<p>The government is promising an extra \u00a31m to boost basic skills through \"financial literacy\" and \"citizenship\". But what has citizenship got to do with the problem of the seven million adults with poor basic skills? </p> <p>At the Basic Skills Agency we have been working in the community for long enough to know just how important \"citizenship\" and \"community\" are for encouraging people to learn. </p> <p>Adults want to improve their basic skills for many different reasons; some to help them get a job or gain promotion, some so that they can read to their children and help with homework. But there are other important reasons that are not so obvious and straightforward. </p> <p>People with poor basic skills are vulnerable consumers and they're often excluded citizens. They are likely to have the least money and the greatest need to be able to compare prices and read the small print. They are most likely to fall prey to loan sharks and dodgy deals. To get by in life a little better and not be exploited is a strong motivation to do something about your poor literacy or numeracy. </p> <p>Life for a consumer is not simple. No longer do you sign up for your gas from the local gas board, but choose between 60 different companies. Being a tenant requires complex knowledge of rights and finances. Tenants need to read tenancy agreements and handbooks, fill in forms for utilities and benefits, deal with bills and negotiate with landlords over repairs and conditions. Increasingly, they are being encouraged to attend meetings, complete survey forms and get involved in community consultation exercises. People with poor basic skills are often intimidated by the reading and writing involved in all this and opt out altogether. </p> <p>Poor skills stop people getting involved in their communities. Improving these essential skills, the agency's work conclusively shows, breaks down barriers to social exclusion. Through the Adult and Community Learning Fund, we have seen hostel residents with improved basic skills now willing to contribute to house meetings; parents on skills courses in family centres getting keen to organise a parent-toddler group; tenants who've done a meeting-skills course joining the residents action group; young probation clients on a basic skills and IT course producing an in-house newsletter; people completing a numeracy course being encouraged to join the credit union. These examples are commonplace. </p> <p>With help from Citizens Advice Bureaux workers and Refugee Council tutors, the agency has developed Citizen 2000, a course which puts skills into context and motivates people to learn by making them real. To improve reading, the course uses material people come across every day - circulars, letters from social security, notices from local councillors and community newsletters. By giving people the skills to read and understand such literature, we know that they are more likely to respond to local campaigns, contribute to local initiatives, speak up at meetings, take on roles in local community groups and perhaps even vote. </p> <p>Learners are prompted into debate and discussion, to use the web to find out more, to differentiate between fact and opinion, to write letters to officials, to take accurate minutes at meetings and much more. </p> <p>To tackle the terrible basic skills problems in this country, learning must be taken into people's communities and made relevant to the people who are actually going to take part in it. Perhaps only then will we see the real sense of community re-established in Britain today and a level of literacy and numeracy that is acceptable for an industrialised country in the 21st century.</p> <p>\u0095 Andrea Mearing is assistant director (Adult and Community Learning Fund) of the Basic Skills Agency.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The government is promising an extra \u00a31m to boost basic skills through \"financial literacy\" and \"citizenship\". But what has citizenship got to do with the problem of the seven million adults with poor basic skills? At the Basic Skills Agency we have been working in the community for long enough to know just how important \"citizenship\" and \"community\" are for encouraging people to learn. Adults want to improve their basic skills for many different reasons; some to help them get a job or gain promotion, some so that they can read to their children and help with homework. But there are other important reasons that are not so obvious and straightforward. People with poor basic skills are vulnerable consumers and they're often excluded citizens. They are likely to have the least money and the greatest need to be able to compare prices and read the small print. They are most likely to fall prey to loan sharks and dodgy deals. To get by in life a little better and not be exploited is a strong motivation to do something about your poor literacy or numeracy. Life for a consumer is not simple. No longer do you sign up for your gas from the local gas board, but choose between 60 different companies. Being a tenant requires complex knowledge of rights and finances. Tenants need to read tenancy agreements and handbooks, fill in forms for utilities and benefits, deal with bills and negotiate with landlords over repairs and conditions. Increasingly, they are being encouraged to attend meetings, complete survey forms and get involved in community consultation exercises. People with poor basic skills are often intimidated by the reading and writing involved in all this and opt out altogether. Poor skills stop people getting involved in their communities. Improving these essential skills, the agency's work conclusively shows, breaks down barriers to social exclusion. Through the Adult and Community Learning Fund, we have seen hostel residents with improved basic skills now willing to contribute to house meetings; parents on skills courses in family centres getting keen to organise a parent-toddler group; tenants who've done a meeting-skills course joining the residents action group; young probation clients on a basic skills and IT course producing an in-house newsletter; people completing a numeracy course being encouraged to join the credit union. These examples are commonplace. With help from Citizens Advice Bureaux workers and Refugee Council tutors, the agency has developed Citizen 2000, a course which puts skills into context and motivates people to learn by making them real. To improve reading, the course uses material people come across every day - circulars, letters from social security, notices from local councillors and community newsletters. By giving people the skills to read and understand such literature, we know that they are more likely to respond to local campaigns, contribute to local initiatives, speak up at meetings, take on roles in local community groups and perhaps even vote. Learners are prompted into debate and discussion, to use the web to find out more, to differentiate between fact and opinion, to write letters to officials, to take accurate minutes at meetings and much more. To tackle the terrible basic skills problems in this country, learning must be taken into people's communities and made relevant to the people who are actually going to take part in it. Perhaps only then will we see the real sense of community re-established in Britain today and a level of literacy and numeracy that is acceptable for an industrialised country in the 21st century. \u0095 Andrea Mearing is assistant director (Adult and Community Learning Fund) of the Basic Skills Agency.",

      "body": "<p>Japanese students have a word for it. A \"freeter\" is someone doing a series of casual jobs after leaving university or high school, and staying free from a company career. It is a sign that things are changing from the days when graduates filed from campus into the most prestigious firm they could and stayed there. The job for life is disappearing and students know it. </p> <p>So they are beginning to want more from university - traditionally seen as a four-year doss between intensive cramming at school and a workaholic career - and the government is certainly beginning to demand more from the country's higher education institutions. It wants to see more intitiative from academics when it comes to research and links with industry - at present, staff at the main public universities are civil servants - and it wants to see universities fostering the ability of students to think for themselves. </p> <p>The 21st century will be unpredictable territory and, in one of the seismic shifts that seem to occur in Japanese society from time to time, schools, universities, government ministers and business leaders are all talking about the need to develop imagination and initiative. (The contrast with England's drive for basic skills measured by more and more tests is striking.) </p> <p>\"The future of this country depends on our brains - we have no natural resources,\" said Masao Homma, director general for policy at the education ministry. </p> <p>Institutions will also have to think for themselves if the government's plan to make them independent agencies is carried through after this Sunday's general election. (A reshuffle of ministers but no great changes in policy is the most common prediction.) </p> <p>The country's 650 universities are nervous about the future, it seemed to me. Not all are enthusiastic about the government's proposed reforms. Shigehiko Hasumi, president of Tokyo University, which is considered the most prestigious and difficult to get into, said he did not call them \"reforms\" because all the government's reforms had been unsuccessful. Being given the legal status of an independent body (as a British university has) would allow public universities to earn more income from research - at present it goes into to the coffers of the education ministry. But ministers' chief motive was simply to cut the number of civil servants by altering the status of 100,000 academics, said Hasumi. There would be a lot of upheaval with few results. </p> <p>More fundamental is Japan's steeply declining birthrate. It has fallen from 13.6 per 1,000 of the population in 1980, to 10.0 in 1990 and 9.6 in 1998. Unlike Britain, which is struggling to raise participation in higher education to 50%, Japan has been at this level for years. In addition to the large number of universities - 80% of them private - there are about 600 junior colleges. Competition to get into the best universities has been intense, though work is said to slacken off once students arrive. University is hard to get into but easy to get out of (ie graduate from), say the Japanese. There is jubilation and despair when Tokyo University posts the lists of entrants - successful candidates are tossed in the air. </p> <p>Tokyo is still a magnet but some universities are struggling to keep up admissions, and by 2009 there will be enough higher education places for every single 18-year-old. Clearly not all these institutions will survive. On one prediction, more than 100 will go bankrupt or be merged by the education ministry. Applications for some of the big private universities like Keio and Nihon have dropped by a third since 1992. </p> <p>This is easing the exam hell for students. It is university entrance exams which dominate the senior years of high school. A typical student might sit four or five entrance exams at a cost of \u00a3250 each - a handy source of income for the universities and part of the country's large exam-coaching industry - and the exam format has reinforced rigid teaching methods in schools. </p> <p>Some universities have reacted by cutting fees. (Japanese parents pay such whopping fees to both public and private universities - students themselves are not expected to go into debt - that it is tempting to speculate that it is the cost of higher education that has cut the birth rate so drastically.) The first year at Keio, a well respected university in Tokyo, would set you back \u00a36,700 (including a \u00a32,000 entrance fee); it is \u00a34,800 at Tokyo University, one of the national (public) institutions. </p> <p>Others, like Hosei, a 120-year-old private university in Tokyo, are relying on revamped courses to attract applicants. Its president, Tadao Kiyonari, is proud applications have held up and attributes this to new degrees like intercultural communication, and computer science. Numbers choosing traditional subjects like literature or economics have fallen as students and employers demand more vocational education. </p> <p>None of the students I spoke to at Hosei expected to go into a company for life. The university is also offering a one-year masters for computer professionals, which has attracted a lot of 30-year-olds who had quit their firms, said Professor Kiyonari. He added proudly that a quarter of the students on the course were starting their own companies, and a third were women. </p> <p>Hosei is starting an American outpost in California's Silicon Valley to tap into high-tech business and academic talent there. Professor Kiyonari thinks international collaborations will increase so postgraduates can do half their credits in Japan and half, say, in the US. </p> <p>Few foreign students attend Japanese universities but the government wants this to change. Language has been a problem. British universities have been choosy about which institutions they associate with, believing the quality to be variable, and Universitas 21, the international grouping of leading research universities, has signed up three Chinese members - Beijing, Fudan and Hong Kong - but none in Japan. Talks are understood to be under way with Kyoto University. </p> <p>When it comes to research, Japan has a reputation for checking and replicating results from scientists elsewhere, and it rankles with academics that companies award research contracts abroad. The pharmaceutical company Yoshitomi, for instance, recently opened a \u00a32m laboratory with Glasgow and Strathclyde to develop drugs for schizophrenia.</p> <p>The government's response has been to announce an assessment modelled on Britain's Research Assessment Exercise to sort out the wheat from the chaff, implying that government funding will soon become more selective. Teaching will also be evaluated. A succession of British vice-chancellors has been describing the pros and cons of the RAE and teaching quality assessments, but with a generally positive message.</p> <p>Academics are nervous about this, admits Tsutomo Kimura, president of the National Institute of Academic Degrees and Evaluation. \"We have evaluations of different countries and our conclusion is that the British system would suit us best.\" </p> <p>Taking universities out of the civil service would mean academics could be paid more on merit and less on seniority, and give more power to principals. Would Japan see the growth of short-term contracts for researchers and lecturers? \"The British system is a little too radical for us,\" said Kimura. He thought the American system where staff could work towards secure tenure would be better.</p>",

The 21st century will be unpredictable territory and, in one of the seismic shifts that seem to occur in Japanese society from time to time, schools, universities, government ministers and business leaders are all talking about the need to develop imagination and initiative. (The contrast with England's drive for basic skills measured by more and more tests is striking.) \"The future of this country depends on our brains - we have no natural resources,\" said Masao Homma, director general for policy at the education ministry. Institutions will also have to think for themselves if the government's plan to make them independent agencies is carried through after this Sunday's general election. (A reshuffle of ministers but no great changes in policy is the most common prediction.) The country's 650 universities are nervous about the future, it seemed to me. Not all are enthusiastic about the government's proposed reforms. Shigehiko Hasumi, president of Tokyo University, which is considered the most prestigious and difficult to get into, said he did not call them \"reforms\" because all the government's reforms had been unsuccessful. Being given the legal status of an independent body (as a British university has) would allow public universities to earn more income from research - at present it goes into to the coffers of the education ministry. But ministers' chief motive was simply to cut the number of civil servants by altering the status of 100,000 academics, said Hasumi. There would be a lot of upheaval with few results. More fundamental is Japan's steeply declining birthrate. It has fallen from 13.6 per 1,000 of the population in 1980, to 10.0 in 1990 and 9.6 in 1998. Unlike Britain, which is struggling to raise participation in higher education to 50%, Japan has been at this level for years. In addition to the large number of universities - 80% of them private - there are about 600 junior colleges. Competition to get into the best universities has been intense, though work is said to slacken off once students arrive. University is hard to get into but easy to get out of (ie graduate from), say the Japanese. There is jubilation and despair when Tokyo University posts the lists of entrants - successful candidates are tossed in the air. Tokyo is still a magnet but some universities are struggling to keep up admissions, and by 2009 there will be enough higher education places for every single 18-year-old. Clearly not all these institutions will survive. On one prediction, more than 100 will go bankrupt or be merged by the education ministry. Applications for some of the big private universities like Keio and Nihon have dropped by a third since 1992. This is easing the exam hell for students. It is university entrance exams which dominate the senior years of high school. A typical student might sit four or five entrance exams at a cost of \u00a3250 each - a handy source of income for the universities and part of the country's large exam-coaching industry - and the exam format has reinforced rigid teaching methods in schools. Some universities have reacted by cutting fees. (Japanese parents pay such whopping fees to both public and private universities - students themselves are not expected to go into debt - that it is tempting to speculate that it is the cost of higher education that has cut the birth rate so drastically.) The first year at Keio, a well respected university in Tokyo, would set you back \u00a36,700 (including a \u00a32,000 entrance fee); it is \u00a34,800 at Tokyo University, one of the national (public) institutions. Others, like Hosei, a 120-year-old private university in Tokyo, are relying on revamped courses to attract applicants. Its president, Tadao Kiyonari, is proud applications have held up and attributes this to new degrees like intercultural communication, and computer science. Numbers choosing traditional subjects like literature or economics have fallen as students and employers demand more vocational education. None of the students I spoke to at Hosei expected to go into a company for life. The university is also offering a one-year masters for computer professionals, which has attracted a lot of 30-year-olds who had quit their firms, said Professor Kiyonari. He added proudly that a quarter of the students on the course were starting their own companies, and a third were women. Hosei is starting an American outpost in California's Silicon Valley to tap into high-tech business and academic talent there. Professor Kiyonari thinks international collaborations will increase so postgraduates can do half their credits in Japan and half, say, in the US. Few foreign students attend Japanese universities but the government wants this to change. Language has been a problem. British universities have been choosy about which institutions they associate with, believing the quality to be variable, and Universitas 21, the international grouping of leading research universities, has signed up three Chinese members - Beijing, Fudan and Hong Kong - but none in Japan. Talks are understood to be under way with Kyoto University. When it comes to research, Japan has a reputation for checking and replicating results from scientists elsewhere, and it rankles with academics that companies award research contracts abroad. The pharmaceutical company Yoshitomi, for instance, recently opened a \u00a32m laboratory with Glasgow and Strathclyde to develop drugs for schizophrenia. The government's response has been to announce an assessment modelled on Britain's Research Assessment Exercise to sort out the wheat from the chaff, implying that government funding will soon become more selective. Teaching will also be evaluated. A succession of British vice-chancellors has been describing the pros and cons of the RAE and teaching quality assessments, but with a generally positive message. Academics are nervous about this, admits Tsutomo Kimura, president of the National Institute of Academic Degrees and Evaluation. \"We have evaluations of different countries and our conclusion is that the British system would suit us best.\" Taking universities out of the civil service would mean academics could be paid more on merit and less on seniority, and give more power to principals. Would Japan see the growth of short-term contracts for researchers and lecturers? \"The British system is a little too radical for us,\" said Kimura. He thought the American system where staff could work towards secure tenure would be better.",

      "body": "<p>There's a notice outside Jane Nissen's 18th-century riverside home in west London: Please shut the gate. High tide today. Flooding. Sure enough, quite soon, the whole road is submerged and ducks swim merrily among the marooned cars. Immediately (if you're not in a hurry) there's a sense of adventure: the water lapping round the gateposts recalls the opening chapter of The Children of Green Knowe. And, inside, the clock in the cool stone-flagged hall makes me think of Tom's Midnight Garden.</p> <p>Appropriate really, for, as Jane Nissen tells me, she's always been obsessed with children's books: they've been part of her life at every stage: as a \"very bookish\" child in America, as a mother (she married an Englishman and has four children) as a grandmother, and, of course, as a publisher with a long and distinguished career in children's books. She started off at Puffin. \"Kaye Webb was a neighbour. She had acquired a boat and she knocked on the door one day, in the sixties, to ask if she could park it in our front garden, on the river. I said yes, if you'll take me on as a reader...\"</p> <p>Thirty years on, in 1998, when Jane retired from Hamish Hamilton, she had no intention of putting her feet up. With seemingly boundless energy, and in addition to the work she still does as a consultant and editor, she has set up her own imprint to revive a personal selection of books that are out of print but which, she believes, have a lot to offer today's children.</p> <p>It's an enterprise well in tune with the times - the turn of the century has prompted many publishers to examine their backlists and even, as Fiona Kenshole at OUP tells me, to ransack their own bookshelves for ideas. \"Classic is the new buzzword,\" she says and, across the board, dozens of modern classics have been given a new look. Ann Jungman's new imprint, Barn Owl Books, is bringing back relatively recent books that have gone out of print, and, increasingly, in new fiction there's a return to longer, literary books.</p> <p>\"I feel that quality is coming back into fashion,\" says Jane Nissen - \"of course, we've always had a huge number of wonderful writers but, for too long, they've been up against a rising tide of, well, less 'challenging' books. And, while I'd certainly never condemn all those 'series' books - because they undoubtedly get children reading - I do think that there has been a radical change.</p> <p>\"Yes, certainly JK Rowling has made a huge difference, and another important factor was Philip Pullman's rousing acceptance speech when he won the Carnegie medal in 1996 with Northern Lights - and we should thank David Fickling at Scholastic for daring to publish that trilogy - which, in spite of its length and complexity, has proved that children can cope with long, demanding books. It allowed the doors to swing open, and it's clear that there's a hunger for longer, all-engrossing books by writers of real substance.

      "bodyText": "There's a notice outside Jane Nissen's 18th-century riverside home in west London: Please shut the gate. High tide today. Flooding. Sure enough, quite soon, the whole road is submerged and ducks swim merrily among the marooned cars. Immediately (if you're not in a hurry) there's a sense of adventure: the water lapping round the gateposts recalls the opening chapter of The Children of Green Knowe. And, inside, the clock in the cool stone-flagged hall makes me think of Tom's Midnight Garden. Appropriate really, for, as Jane Nissen tells me, she's always been obsessed with children's books: they've been part of her life at every stage: as a \"very bookish\" child in America, as a mother (she married an Englishman and has four children) as a grandmother, and, of course, as a publisher with a long and distinguished career in children's books. She started off at Puffin. \"Kaye Webb was a neighbour. She had acquired a boat and she knocked on the door one day, in the sixties, to ask if she could park it in our front garden, on the river. I said yes, if you'll take me on as a reader...\" Thirty years on, in 1998, when Jane retired from Hamish Hamilton, she had no intention of putting her feet up. With seemingly boundless energy, and in addition to the work she still does as a consultant and editor, she has set up her own imprint to revive a personal selection of books that are out of print but which, she believes, have a lot to offer today's children. It's an enterprise well in tune with the times - the turn of the century has prompted many publishers to examine their backlists and even, as Fiona Kenshole at OUP tells me, to ransack their own bookshelves for ideas. \"Classic is the new buzzword,\" she says and, across the board, dozens of modern classics have been given a new look. Ann Jungman's new imprint, Barn Owl Books, is bringing back relatively recent books that have gone out of print, and, increasingly, in new fiction there's a return to longer, literary books. \"I feel that quality is coming back into fashion,\" says Jane Nissen - \"of course, we've always had a huge number of wonderful writers but, for too long, they've been up against a rising tide of, well, less 'challenging' books. And, while I'd certainly never condemn all those 'series' books - because they undoubtedly get children reading - I do think that there has been a radical change. \"Yes, certainly JK Rowling has made a huge difference, and another important factor was Philip Pullman's rousing acceptance speech when he won the Carnegie medal in 1996 with Northern Lights - and we should thank David Fickling at Scholastic for daring to publish that trilogy - which, in spite of its length and complexity, has proved that children can cope with long, demanding books. It allowed the doors to swing open, and it's clear that there's a hunger for longer, all-engrossing books by writers of real substance. And that's why I feel that it's now possible to bring back classics from the 1940s, and even earlier, which still have a lot to say. Of course there's an element of risk, but publishing's a risky business.\" Nissen works from home, with a huge desk at the kitchen window.

      "body": "<p>Companies that are offering services to schools and colleges are stock market high-flyers, according to a report that will make uncomfortable reading for ministers. </p> <p>\"The sector has continued to grow revenues at impressive rates of around 30% per annum,\" the City finance house Capital Strategies reports approvingly. \"Since our first report in February 1999, the sector has witnessed some dramatic changes and significant merger and acquisition activity.\" </p> <p>The UK education and training index measures the relative performance of stock market quoted companies with significant parts of their income derived from the education and training sectors. Since January 1 1996 the E&amp;T index has out performed the FT-SE 100, which tracks Britain's top 100 plcs, by a factor of three. While \u00a31,000 invested in the FT-SE all-share index at the start of 1996 would be worth \u00a31,690 at the end of May, the same money invested in the E&amp;T index would be worth an impressive \u00a33,289. </p> <p>James Tooley would approve. The right-wing professor of education policy at Newcastle University has consistently argued for more private-sector involvement in education. </p> <p>The virtue of the profit motive, argues Tooley, is that it \"can motivate investors... and inspire gifted school principals\".</p> <p>Tooley watched the government gingerly put a toe into the shark-infested waters of privately operated education. Education Action Zones were to be funded by industry, which would invest out of a spirit of altruism. Ministers waited for the rush of chief executives waving cheque books, but altruism was in short supply. The kind of high-profile multinationals the government had in mind were bemused by the prospect. \"It's very hard to see how we could do it or what exactly we would get out of it,\" said burger giant McDonald's at the time. \"It's just not our area of expertise.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile, the companies with the expertise lobbied hard for a change of approach. The government needed to take the next step and invite the companies to manage education - and a year later, in 1999, ministers did just that, with advertisements inviting companies to express interest in contracts: \"Which might be for consultancy... or for the provision of the education services themselves.\"</p> <p>The growth of the edubusiness started in the early nineties, when the Thatcher government introduced local management of schools - and headteachers became responsible for a large proportion of their budgets. Labour have accelerated the principle. In September, under new \"fair-funding\" proposals, schools will be free to contract even more services out to the private sector.</p> <p>Whether heads have either the time or the training to manage budgets on this scale is another issue. In independent schools a professional bursar would run the budget and deal with contractors. In state schools, the work is often done by an overworked head or deputy. The edubusiness companies include giants such as Capita. In October last year, the Capita Group acquired Capstan, which had been the largest privately owned recruitment specialist. Months later, Capita snapped up LHR Education, another supply agency. </p> <p>SIMS, the management software used in 22,000 of the UK's 26,000 schools, gives Capita a massive profile in education and moving into teacher recruitment and supply was a natural step for the company, say the report's authors. </p> <p>Capital Strategies predicts further mergers as the largest companies seek to consolidate their positions. The City finance house describes the favourable dynamics of the teacher recruitment business. Favourable for the companies, that is, rather than for the schools searching for staff. </p> <p>Other lucrative areas of operation include school meals, where the UK market is worth an estimated \u00a3800m a year, and consultancy. </p> <p>Cambridge Education Associates are co-ordinating the training for heads and management consultants implementing the government's performance-related pay package.

Local authorities have been the latest group in the education arena to be given the named and shamed spotlight.

Clusters of schools could offer support to each other. A more fundamental problem is the flow of government initiatives. </p> <p>\"The Department for Education needs to realise that they must stop channelling policy through local authorities. You can't take their funding away and still expect them to implement a plethora of policies.\" </p> <p>McNeany would like to see full control of schools, including ownership of their capital assets, offered to edubusiness along with a recognition that contracts need to have longer-term targets. Nord Anglia has stayed out of the bidding for some contracts because the targets were seen as unrealistic, but the education department is getting the message. </p> <p>\"The private sector has helped to shape government policy,\" he said. \"The market brings in concepts of value for money and customer service. It wouldn't require an enormous percentage of schools to be run privately to make a big difference.\" </p> <p>It's a message that rightwingers like James Tooley never believed a Labour government would be receptive to. \"David Blunkett is continuing to support everything I have been talking about,\" he says. Whether Blunkett is happy to see private companies reap rich rewards from the sector is another matter. Either way, investors looking for a nice little earner might consider the E&amp;T index the next time they check the market. Edubusiness is a growth area - for some.</p> <p><strong>Education's entrepreneurs</strong></p> <p><strong> Nord Anglia</strong></p> <p>Led by Kevin McNeary, one of the few teachers to have become a millionaire working in education. He set up a chain of language schools and expanded into independent schools, Ofsted inspections and teacher supply. Went public in 1997. This year's turnover was up 11% to \u00a31.2m with profits up 156%. </p> <p><strong> Chartwells</strong> </p> <p>School caterers Chartwells signed a private financing deal last year in Lewisham, south-east London, to run the authority's entire catering operation - 67 kitchens catering for nearly 100 schools. The market for school meals is huge, with 80% still in local authority hands, but companies such as Chartwells are eroding that lead: \"We operate in 1,330 schools,\" says Mike Sparrow, the managing director. \"That's \u00a340m turnover this year, a growth from \u00a314m three years ago.\" </p> <p><strong> RM</strong> </p> <p>Abingdon-based Research Machines is the leading supplier of software and IT systems to the education market, its current order book is worth more than \u00a3100m.

      "bodyText": "Companies that are offering services to schools and colleges are stock market high-flyers, according to a report that will make uncomfortable reading for ministers. \"The sector has continued to grow revenues at impressive rates of around 30% per annum,\" the City finance house Capital Strategies reports approvingly. \"Since our first report in February 1999, the sector has witnessed some dramatic changes and significant merger and acquisition activity.\" The UK education and training index measures the relative performance of stock market quoted companies with significant parts of their income derived from the education and training sectors. Since January 1 1996 the E&amp;T index has out performed the FT-SE 100, which tracks Britain's top 100 plcs, by a factor of three. While \u00a31,000 invested in the FT-SE all-share index at the start of 1996 would be worth \u00a31,690 at the end of May, the same money invested in the E&amp;T index would be worth an impressive \u00a33,289. James Tooley would approve. The right-wing professor of education policy at Newcastle University has consistently argued for more private-sector involvement in education. The virtue of the profit motive, argues Tooley, is that it \"can motivate investors... and inspire gifted school principals\". Tooley watched the government gingerly put a toe into the shark-infested waters of privately operated education. Education Action Zones were to be funded by industry, which would invest out of a spirit of altruism. Ministers waited for the rush of chief executives waving cheque books, but altruism was in short supply. The kind of high-profile multinationals the government had in mind were bemused by the prospect. \"It's very hard to see how we could do it or what exactly we would get out of it,\" said burger giant McDonald's at the time. \"It's just not our area of expertise.\" Meanwhile, the companies with the expertise lobbied hard for a change of approach. The government needed to take the next step and invite the companies to manage education - and a year later, in 1999, ministers did just that, with advertisements inviting companies to express interest in contracts: \"Which might be for consultancy... or for the provision of the education services themselves.\" The growth of the edubusiness started in the early nineties, when the Thatcher government introduced local management of schools - and headteachers became responsible for a large proportion of their budgets. Labour have accelerated the principle. In September, under new \"fair-funding\" proposals, schools will be free to contract even more services out to the private sector. Whether heads have either the time or the training to manage budgets on this scale is another issue. In independent schools a professional bursar would run the budget and deal with contractors. In state schools, the work is often done by an overworked head or deputy. The edubusiness companies include giants such as Capita. In October last year, the Capita Group acquired Capstan, which had been the largest privately owned recruitment specialist. Months later, Capita snapped up LHR Education, another supply agency. SIMS, the management software used in 22,000 of the UK's 26,000 schools, gives Capita a massive profile in education and moving into teacher recruitment and supply was a natural step for the company, say the report's authors. Capital Strategies predicts further mergers as the largest companies seek to consolidate their positions. The City finance house describes the favourable dynamics of the teacher recruitment business. Favourable for the companies, that is, rather than for the schools searching for staff.
