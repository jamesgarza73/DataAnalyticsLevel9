But supporters expecting a massive influx of money for new signings are likely to be disappointed. </p> <p>The \u00a322m deal will result in Enic owning 29.9% of Tottenham with Daniel Levy, the company's chief executive and a Tottenham season-ticket holder, becoming a non-executive director of the north London club. Sam Chisholm, the former BSkyB chief executive and the club's media adviser, is expected to announce his intention to step down as a director at the same time. </p> <p>Enic stopped at 29.9% because this is the maximum allowed under Stock Exchange rules before Enic would have to launch a bid for the entire company. Sugar, who owned 40% of the shares, has sold 27% to Enic and is expected to divest himself of the other 13% in the new year. The remaining 60% of the club is owned by City institutions and fans. </p> <p>Levy, 38, will be responsible for overseeing a five-year plan for Tottenham designed to return the club to its position as one of the country's top sides. A formal announcement of the deal will be made this morning to the Stock Exchange. </p> <p>Sugar is expected to step down as chairman in February, ending a 10-year association with Spurs. Sugar's initial investment in Tottenham was just under \u00a38m but he finally decided to sell his controlling interest after a constant campaign of criticism from fans. The Tottenham chairman approached Enic last Saturday asking it to make an offer. </p> <p>Enic has made two previous bids for Spurs, the first in July 1998 when it offered just over 80p a share. A second offer of \u00a31.20 a share was also rejected in July this year but as fans became increasingly hostile towards Sugar his family convinced him to sell. The price of yesterday's deal was thought to be around 80p a share, valuing the club at \u00a360m. </p> <p>Tottenham fans expecting immediate change will be disappointed. Levy's advisers emphasised that it would be business as usual until a new managing director and chairman could be found. </p> <p>Levy hates publicity and has no desire to take on the chairmanship, preferring instead to find a figurehead and pull the strings in the background. Other new faces are likely to be appointed to the board in a clean break from the Sugar era. </p> <p>His first priority will be to put together the plan to bring the glory days back to White Hart Lane. He is likely to start with a blank sheet of paper and examine every detail of the club, from the playing staff through to the way the club shop is run. He is certain to invest in the club but will not let his passion for the team overrule his business sense. \"He won't be spending wildly just for the sake of it,\" a friend said. </p> <p>Finding a media partner is likely to be an urgent priority. Levy believes in the power of the internet and television to generate new revenues for the club and boost Spurs' profile in foreign markets like the Far East and the US. Broadcasters will be encouraged to invest in the club in return for a slice of future television money. </p> <p>City analysts who have followed the mediocre performance of Spurs' share price warn he has a lot to do. \"He's going to have to spend a lot of money if they're going to catch up with Arsenal,\" said one analyst. \"I just hope he knows how big a job he's got.\" Enic owns stakes in Rangers, Slavia Prague, Vicenza, FC Basle and AEK Athens. </p> <p>Oliver Butler, editor of the business magazine Soccer Investor, said: \"Tottenham will be Enic's flagship club but the company is unlikely to make millions available overnight. They have not done that with their other clubs and are unlikely to change their approach.\" </p> <p>Mark Jacob, co-founder of Save Our Spurs, a pressure group formed this season to oust Sugar, said: \"We are cautiously optimistic. We would like to thank Mr Sugar for his period of tenure at Tottenham. He put the financial standing of the club on an even keel but unfortunately he was not able to speculate to accumulate. </p> <p>\"We were disappointed that Mr Sugar felt that he and his family were being abused but the feelings of passionate supporters are such that Spurs is in their blood and perhaps they do go overboard.\" </p> <p><strong>Enic's football empire</strong></p> <p><strong>Rangers</strong><br> The partnership has so far been a disappointment to Enic, who purchased a 25.1% stake in January 1997 but diluted to 20.2% by a rights issue in March. The stake is now worth around 30m. Enic's chairman Howard Stanton resigned from Rangers' board last year, allegedly in protest at the club's business plan. Enic policy is to take stakes in clubs who regularly appear in European competition, tighten management structures and then capitalise on the marketing and media rights. </p> <p> <strong>Slavia Prague</strong><br> A year ago Enic increased its stake from 63.7% to 96.7% prompted by the club's on-pitch success and the fact they tend to earn a place in European competitions.

      "body": "<p><strong>Social care</strong></p> <p><strong>Ian Johnston</strong>, director of the British Association of Social Workers</p> <p>The BASW wants: </p> <ul> <li>The challenges and achievements of social workers and other social care staff to be recognised by politicians and the general public. <ul> <li>An end to social workers being held up as scapegoats for the failings of society and for them to be valued for their contribution to the wellbeing of the very substantial number of people of all ages, from every walk of life, who depend on their services. </li> <li>And, of course, for the staff team to win the lottery.</li> </ul></li> </ul> <p><strong>Jennifer Bernard</strong>, chief executive of the Central Council for Education and Training in Social Work</p> <p>All I want for Christmas is: </p> <ul> <li>For everyone who works in social care to make a new year's resolution to review their training needs - and to act on the results. There should be no more reliance on unaccredited training or vintage qualifications. <ul> <li>That every practice teacher takes responsibility for at least one student placement during 2001 - it would help the student's development and the practice teacher's ability to demonstrate that they want to continue to learn themselves. </li> <li>If you have started a qualification and stalled, to get on and finish it, ending social care's reputation of being a registration-only zone with completion trailing on into infinity. </li> <li>That all employers will make sure that their agency has a staff development plan that matches their business plan and objectives. Given that staff will be doing the work their skills must be developed to deliver the organisation's goals. </li> <li>More mentors for schemes such as that run by the ADSS to work alongside people from black and minority ethnic groups and ensure that their career development is supported. </li> <li>That no one is selected for employment in social care in 2001 who has not been fully assessed as suitable - preferably with the help of people who will be using their services. </li> <li>And, of course, that we find more funds to make the wider delivery of training strategies affordable for all agencies and individuals - not least the poverty-stricken social work students.</li> </ul></li> </ul> <p><strong>Daphne Statham</strong>, director of the National Institute of Social Work</p> <p>I have three wishes for 2001: </p> <ul> <li>Achieving good results for people using services remains central to the new organisations that will set standards and regulate both the services themselves and the delivery of them. Work in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales is being pushed forward. In England services are being reshaped, and chief executive, chair and council members are being appointed. Keeping on the target of being user friendly will be crucial to their success. <ul> <li>The people appointed to run these organisations should be expert at connecting services and networking. A range of standards are being put into place in social care: the national service frameworks, standards of conduct and practice for workers, for education and training, together with best practice guides based on reviews of social care knowledge. All these need to connect with each other and with existing and developing frameworks on health, housing and education. Skilled communicators able to connect with other areas of social care are therefore essential. Only then will front line workers and service users have a coherent and accessible framework to work within, and only then will they be able to make a difference to people's lives. </li> <li>Some of the media and some politicians should spend less time beating social workers and social care staff about the head in 2001. Social workers and social care staff help people to remain in their homes, keep families together, supplement or replace family support when risks are too high and contribute to health, employment and education objectives. Being accountable for what we do and any failures is obviously necessary. What I object to is attacks on the whole of social care. The national task force on violence to social care staff found that front line workers thought these attacks paved the way for verbal and physical abuse. If the message is \"you are rubbish\", that's how you tend to get treated.</li> </ul></li> </ul> <p><strong>John Buttle</strong>, business manager of CareandHealth</p> <p>What would CareandHealth, a company providing information for the social care sector, like for Christmas:</p> <ul> <li>A new bank holiday, when for one day only people promise not to fall ill or suffer hardship so that social workers and nurses can for once share a holiday with the rest of the population. <ul> <li>A series of in-depth nationwide tabloid expos\u00e9s of all the good practice that changes thousands of lives a year but never normally gets a mention. </li> <li>A sense of pride and public confidence in the work we do brought about through the fulfilment of the dream for a general social care council. </li> <li>A means to spread good tidings to the whole care sector through universal internet access and email for all social work staff. </li> <li>A brighter, more secure future for thousands of children though the success of the government's adoption task force.</li> </ul></li> </ul> <p><a href=\"http://www.careandhealth.com\">CareandHealth</a> </p> <p><strong>Felicity Collier</strong>, chief executive of the British Agencies for Fostering and Adoption</p> <p>The white paper on adoption has been delivered for Christmas - which reminds me of the Downing Street adoption summit I attended at Easter. Both Christmas and Easter are special occasions for children and families, so what better time to talk about real families for those children who do not have them?</p> <p>If Christmas is for presents, then the new year is certainly for wishes and resolutions - what would be at the top of BAAF's wish list?</p> <ul> <li>For every child to be in a safe place for 2001. <ul> <li>A new understanding between the public and social workers, with an end to \"blaming\" and instead an appreciation of the tough job social workers do on the front line. </li> <li>More people having confidence in social workers, which would lead to more adopters and foster carers coming forward. </li> <li>Better financial support for adoptive families. </li> <li>Full implementation of the Children Leaving Care Act. </li> <li>Women who relinquished their infants for adoption many years ago to be given access to records so that they can pass messages to their adopted adult children.</li> </ul></li> </ul> <p><strong>Housing</strong></p> <p><strong>Dilys Fletcher</strong>, vice-chair of the Higginshaw Estate Management Board, Oldham</p> <p>If I could have just one thing for Christmas, it would be to wipe out the stigma attached to being a council house tenant. I come from a generation who got vetted to live on this estate. Now people lie about living here. Even the kids feel the stigma.</p> <p>My tenants don't perceive themselves as socially excluded and socially disadvantaged, but in order to get money for an estate I have to say that they are. I would like not to have to degrade people in order to get money to improve their lives.</p> <p>I would like to feel that when the government says all these lovely things about tenants' involvement and bottom-up working that they really mean them. But they don't. </p> <p>I would like to go into meetings side by side with ministers. I sit on many committees in Oldham. People ask for my opinions but we are not making any decisions \u00ad they are dictated by the party in power and the personality of the director. I want to be making policy.</p> <p>Tenants are the biggest providers of employment at the moment - consultants, the DETR and the universities must have made millions of pounds out of tenants. I go to committees and tenants pay for my second-class train fare for a full day in London. The only attempt to pay tenants has come from the Audit Commission for best value reviews, but they too don't use the tenants properly. They ask them to telephone residents to ask how they feel about repairs. The tenants should be interviewing the directors.</p> <p>Finally, I would like to sign Mel Gibson up for one of our properties. This estate is 80% women on their own \u00ad it would be all their Christmas dreams come true.</p> <p><strong>Carol Radmore</strong>, chief executive of the Family Housing Group</p> <p>My best Christmas present would be a housing benefit system that is simple and that delivers - most of all for our tenants. I'm fed up with the angst they have to go through to get what is theirs by right and sick of the time our staff have to spend helping tenants to get their benefits. I would much rather could spend those resources on more constructive projects.</p> <p>I would like mainstream funding for community regeneration work to be available for registered social landlords. At the moment, we are all doing it on the side but we're constantly asking ourselves, \"Should we be doing this or shouldn't we?\"</p> <p>I would also get rid of the right to buy because it does not help to promote mixed communities. I would like VAT to be taken off refurbishment so that there is less of an incentive to build new houses when refurbishment is often a better option.</p> <p>On the professional side, there is still a \"them and us\" culture between registered social landlords and local authorities that I would like to see broken down. </p> <p>When I used to work in a local authority, people used to resent housing associations because they were not subject to compulsory competitive tendering.

Our biggest wish is that this happens quickly and seamlessly, that government agrees to \"buy\" a single set of outcomes from RDAs, with sensible monitoring and review arrangements.

If Santa could just pull this one off, the RDAs would be forever indebted.</p> <p>Second, we would love a decision from Europe on setting up regional venture capital funds, and for funds to be made available quickly.

We wish for the urgent go-ahead of major investment in our roads and railways, to unlock bottlenecks and help economic regeneration and renewal.</p> <p>The RDAs have a crucial role to play, not just in physical regeneration, but in social regeneration too. A quick decision on single regeneration budget, round seven, or its replacement, would be really welcome, so that we can tackle the problems in our most needy communities. </p> <p>The rural white paper was on our Christmas wishlist last year, and we welcome this brave new policy statement. Policies being developed from it should form the cornerstones of a thriving economy. Central to issues in rural areas is the need to relax red tape for rural businesses and to make planning a quicker and simpler process, so that farmers and other rural businesses can diversify more quickly. </p> <p>Also in the rural white paper was a pledge to give local power to country towns and villages, to help them play a central role in shaping the future of their own communities. We hope that this happens quickly, and that local people take up the opportunity to make a positive difference and take advantage of the new funding which will be available across rural areas.</p> <p><strong>Regeneration</strong></p> <p><strong>Professor Brian Robson</strong>, Geography, Manchester University</p> <p>My best Christmas present would be for my mantra 'No cities; no civilization' to top the list of Christmas carols. The urban white paper outlines a new framework through which towns and cities could be put more firmly to the fore of the agenda. </p> <p>The economy needs strong cities; social justice requires targeted intervention to re-engage the excluded who are overwhelmingly found in cities. General national schemes for competitiveness, education, crime and the like do not necessarily benefit either cities or their poor. We need to recognise that place matters and that legislation needs to be place-specific and focused on supporting the efforts of cities to reinvent themselves and to link their fortunes with those of their poor. </p> <p>Getting cities to the top of the policy agenda is vital. The danger is that the rural lobbies are so much better organised and that, with an election apparently in the offing, the momentum of the white paper could dissipate. </p> <p>The white paper builds in some milestones - an urban forum in 2002, a state-of-the-cities report in 2005. But we need 'friends of the cities' to sing the praises of regeneration schemes that have worked, as well as to keep pointing to the urban problems that remain. Far better that than more murder and mayhem that merely captures the short-term attention of the media.</p> <p><strong>Voluntary sector</strong></p> <p><strong>Lis Pritchard</strong>, director of the National Association of Councils for Voluntary Service</p> <p> What do I want for Christmas? </p> <p>On the serious side, adequate and consistent statutory funding for local infrastructure bodies such as CVS to enable them to play a full part in the government's social inclusion initiatives. The Local Strategic Partnerships (LSPs) will only work if the voluntary and community sector is resourced properly to enable effective participation.</p> <p>Central and local government need to agree on the best way to fund this involvement. In both Scotland and Wales there is already some central funding for local infrastucture bodies.

      "bodyText": "Social care Ian Johnston, director of the British Association of Social Workers The BASW wants: The challenges and achievements of social workers and other social care staff to be recognised by politicians and the general public. An end to social workers being held up as scapegoats for the failings of society and for them to be valued for their contribution to the wellbeing of the very substantial number of people of all ages, from every walk of life, who depend on their services. And, of course, for the staff team to win the lottery. Jennifer Bernard, chief executive of the Central Council for Education and Training in Social Work All I want for Christmas is: For everyone who works in social care to make a new year's resolution to review their training needs - and to act on the results. There should be no more reliance on unaccredited training or vintage qualifications. That every practice teacher takes responsibility for at least one student placement during 2001 - it would help the student's development and the practice teacher's ability to demonstrate that they want to continue to learn themselves. If you have started a qualification and stalled, to get on and finish it, ending social care's reputation of being a registration-only zone with completion trailing on into infinity. That all employers will make sure that their agency has a staff development plan that matches their business plan and objectives. Given that staff will be doing the work their skills must be developed to deliver the organisation's goals. More mentors for schemes such as that run by the ADSS to work alongside people from black and minority ethnic groups and ensure that their career development is supported. That no one is selected for employment in social care in 2001 who has not been fully assessed as suitable - preferably with the help of people who will be using their services. And, of course, that we find more funds to make the wider delivery of training strategies affordable for all agencies and individuals - not least the poverty-stricken social work students. Daphne Statham, director of the National Institute of Social Work I have three wishes for 2001: Achieving good results for people using services remains central to the new organisations that will set standards and regulate both the services themselves and the delivery of them. Work in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales is being pushed forward. In England services are being reshaped, and chief executive, chair and council members are being appointed. Keeping on the target of being user friendly will be crucial to their success. The people appointed to run these organisations should be expert at connecting services and networking. A range of standards are being put into place in social care: the national service frameworks, standards of conduct and practice for workers, for education and training, together with best practice guides based on reviews of social care knowledge. All these need to connect with each other and with existing and developing frameworks on health, housing and education. Skilled communicators able to connect with other areas of social care are therefore essential. Only then will front line workers and service users have a coherent and accessible framework to work within, and only then will they be able to make a difference to people's lives. Some of the media and some politicians should spend less time beating social workers and social care staff about the head in 2001. Social workers and social care staff help people to remain in their homes, keep families together, supplement or replace family support when risks are too high and contribute to health, employment and education objectives. Being accountable for what we do and any failures is obviously necessary. What I object to is attacks on the whole of social care. The national task force on violence to social care staff found that front line workers thought these attacks paved the way for verbal and physical abuse. If the message is \"you are rubbish\", that's how you tend to get treated. John Buttle, business manager of CareandHealth What would CareandHealth, a company providing information for the social care sector, like for Christmas: A new bank holiday, when for one day only people promise not to fall ill or suffer hardship so that social workers and nurses can for once share a holiday with the rest of the population. A series of in-depth nationwide tabloid expos\u00e9s of all the good practice that changes thousands of lives a year but never normally gets a mention. A sense of pride and public confidence in the work we do brought about through the fulfilment of the dream for a general social care council. A means to spread good tidings to the whole care sector through universal internet access and email for all social work staff. A brighter, more secure future for thousands of children though the success of the government's adoption task force. CareandHealth Felicity Collier, chief executive of the British Agencies for Fostering and Adoption The white paper on adoption has been delivered for Christmas - which reminds me of the Downing Street adoption summit I attended at Easter. Both Christmas and Easter are special occasions for children and families, so what better time to talk about real families for those children who do not have them? If Christmas is for presents, then the new year is certainly for wishes and resolutions - what would be at the top of BAAF's wish list? For every child to be in a safe place for 2001. A new understanding between the public and social workers, with an end to \"blaming\" and instead an appreciation of the tough job social workers do on the front line. More people having confidence in social workers, which would lead to more adopters and foster carers coming forward. Better financial support for adoptive families. Full implementation of the Children Leaving Care Act. Women who relinquished their infants for adoption many years ago to be given access to records so that they can pass messages to their adopted adult children. Housing Dilys Fletcher, vice-chair of the Higginshaw Estate Management Board, Oldham If I could have just one thing for Christmas, it would be to wipe out the stigma attached to being a council house tenant. I come from a generation who got vetted to live on this estate. Now people lie about living here. Even the kids feel the stigma. My tenants don't perceive themselves as socially excluded and socially disadvantaged, but in order to get money for an estate I have to say that they are. I would like not to have to degrade people in order to get money to improve their lives. I would like to feel that when the government says all these lovely things about tenants' involvement and bottom-up working that they really mean them. But they don't. I would like to go into meetings side by side with ministers. I sit on many committees in Oldham. People ask for my opinions but we are not making any decisions they are dictated by the party in power and the personality of the director. I want to be making policy. Tenants are the biggest providers of employment at the moment - consultants, the DETR and the universities must have made millions of pounds out of tenants. I go to committees and tenants pay for my second-class train fare for a full day in London. The only attempt to pay tenants has come from the Audit Commission for best value reviews, but they too don't use the tenants properly. They ask them to telephone residents to ask how they feel about repairs. The tenants should be interviewing the directors. Finally, I would like to sign Mel Gibson up for one of our properties. This estate is 80% women on their own it would be all their Christmas dreams come true. Carol Radmore, chief executive of the Family Housing Group My best Christmas present would be a housing benefit system that is simple and that delivers - most of all for our tenants. I'm fed up with the angst they have to go through to get what is theirs by right and sick of the time our staff have to spend helping tenants to get their benefits. I would much rather could spend those resources on more constructive projects. I would like mainstream funding for community regeneration work to be available for registered social landlords. At the moment, we are all doing it on the side but we're constantly asking ourselves, \"Should we be doing this or shouldn't we?\" I would also get rid of the right to buy because it does not help to promote mixed communities. I would like VAT to be taken off refurbishment so that there is less of an incentive to build new houses when refurbishment is often a better option. On the professional side, there is still a \"them and us\" culture between registered social landlords and local authorities that I would like to see broken down. When I used to work in a local authority, people used to resent housing associations because they were not subject to compulsory competitive tendering. A similar situation exists with best value. People spend too much time agonising rather than pulling together, yet the regimes governing the two sectors are in fact similar. Harris Beider, executive director of the Federation of Black Housing Organisations I would like to see much greater social justice that enables people to reach their full potential and a debate about what it means to live in a society that is driven by equal opportunity. In mainstream housing associations, 16% of employees are black but there are only two black chairs and one chief executive. The problem is not lack of qualifications it is the old boys' network and the macho drinking culture. Most black people, and most women I know, don't want to get involved in that. We need a new organisational culture that is transparent, accountable and meritocratic. If we had more black people in senior management posts, the whole culture would change. We need new systems of working that reach out to black graduates and fast-stream them. In the corporate sector, companies are doing it because they believe this will make them a better business. The Lawrence report changed the terms of the debate but only created a small window of opportunity that we must seize. I'd like to see black and minority ethnic housing associations (BME) getting the investment to be local champions in rebuilding communities. BME associations are trusted because of their radical roots and campaigning past. But there are also debates to be had within the black community. When I came to the FBHO there was a culture of talking mainly to black organisations. You don't learn much if you always talk to people with the same perspective. Things are changing. White people who grew up in the 70s and 80s are more relaxed in terms of black culture and working with black colleagues, though we still have to fight the old \"whiteguard\". For my last wish and given the success of the English cricket team since Nasser Hussain took over as captain I'd like to see a black housing minister. Then we'll know we really have arrived. Health Roy Lilley, fellow of the Imperial College, London, and former NHS trust chair Just like most factories, offices and workplaces, staff in the NHS will be getting together for their Christmas parties. They will go to a nearby restaurant or pub for some festive cheer. Heaven forbid they are given a dirty glass. They will create hell with the bar staff and insist on it being changed. They will be oblivious to the fact that 1,500 of their customers - patients in the NHS - are likely to have died this year from infections they have acquired in hospital, mainly because staff in the NHS don't remember to wash their hands often enough. Probably NHS staff, like the rest of us, will leave their shopping to the last minute and rely on late-opening shops. They will overlook the fact that for most of the working population, GP surgeries open too late for them to visit a doctor before they start a journey to work and close well before they get home. If they are given a Christmas present that doesn't work, doesn't fit or isn't the right colour, they will take it back and demand a refund or something more to their taste. They will forget the number of hip operations that have to be redone, breast-screening results that have been wrong, muddled or misleading, doctors who have killed their patients and hospitals that have removed the wrong organ. What would I give the NHS for Christmas? Tied up in a big bow would be a large measure of common sense. The NHS is full of some of the brightest and best educated people you are ever likely to meet. The trouble is, when they come to work they leave the real world behind. NHS staff should bring real-world expectations to work. The standards they insist upon in stores, corner shops, garages and restaurants should be imported to their work place. No great expectations, just the ordinary, reasonable expectations they come face to face with every day. The best presents are always the simplest.

Vincent Watts, lead chair of the English Regional Development Agencies A well-earned Christmas break is top of the wish list for staff at the nine English Regional Development Agencies this Christmas. In just 21 months of operation, the eight agencies that were set up in April 1999 have recorded significant successes on the road to improving economic performance across the English regions, as has the London Development Agency, established earlier this year.

We hope that this happens quickly, and that local people take up the opportunity to make a positive difference and take advantage of the new funding which will be available across rural areas. Regeneration Professor Brian Robson, Geography, Manchester University My best Christmas present would be for my mantra 'No cities; no civilization' to top the list of Christmas carols. The urban white paper outlines a new framework through which towns and cities could be put more firmly to the fore of the agenda. The economy needs strong cities; social justice requires targeted intervention to re-engage the excluded who are overwhelmingly found in cities. General national schemes for competitiveness, education, crime and the like do not necessarily benefit either cities or their poor. We need to recognise that place matters and that legislation needs to be place-specific and focused on supporting the efforts of cities to reinvent themselves and to link their fortunes with those of their poor. Getting cities to the top of the policy agenda is vital. The danger is that the rural lobbies are so much better organised and that, with an election apparently in the offing, the momentum of the white paper could dissipate. The white paper builds in some milestones - an urban forum in 2002, a state-of-the-cities report in 2005. But we need 'friends of the cities' to sing the praises of regeneration schemes that have worked, as well as to keep pointing to the urban problems that remain. Far better that than more murder and mayhem that merely captures the short-term attention of the media. Voluntary sector Lis Pritchard, director of the National Association of Councils for Voluntary Service What do I want for Christmas? On the serious side, adequate and consistent statutory funding for local infrastructure bodies such as CVS to enable them to play a full part in the government's social inclusion initiatives. The Local Strategic Partnerships (LSPs) will only work if the voluntary and community sector is resourced properly to enable effective participation. Central and local government need to agree on the best way to fund this involvement. In both Scotland and Wales there is already some central funding for local infrastucture bodies. This needs to be resolved in England as well. Apart from this, I would like to be able to take holidays without having to come back to several hundreds of emails as well as all the usual pile of accumulated work. Stuart Etherington, CEO of the National Council of Voluntary Organisations The two things I would like the voluntary sector to get for Christmas are: For the government to follow the example set by the Scottish Executive and grant free criminal record checks for volunteers working for charities and community groups. Some prior warning if the general election is not going to be next May, so the NCVO has time to prepare itself. What is your Christmas wish for the public sector? Email Patrick.Butler@theguardian.com with your wish list for the new year.",

      "bodyText": "The charity managers known as the Cambridge Two, jailed for allowing drugs to be peddled at a Cambridge hostel for the homeless where they worked, today lost their appeal to clear their names. Ruth Wyner and John Brock, who worked for the Wintercomfort charity, immediately warned that the decision leaves the threat of imprisonment hanging over all professionals who work on drug addiction projects. But police and prosecutors said the ruling vindicated their finding that Ms Wyner and Mr Brock had clearly broken the law, and said that they would not hesitate to pursue similar actions in the future. The pair were convicted in 1999 for knowingly permitting the supply of heroin to Overstream House at the Wintercomfort Centre hostel. Ms Wyner and Mr Brock, both 50, will not return to jail because they have already spent 207 days in prison before being released on bail in July to appeal against their conviction. The jailing of the Cambridge Two has been a cause of concern for workers at hostels and day centres across the country. The charity had operated a policy of confidentiality under which information about the homeless and vulnerable people who attended the centre would not generally be passed on to outside agencies, including the police. After the conviction of the pair, some charities began turning away drug addicts and suffered staff shortages because people were unwilling to run the risk of imprisonment for failing to inform on those seeking shelter.

Disappointment at the failure of the Federal Reserve, America's central bank, to cut interest rates on Tuesday prompted a second day of heavy selling on Wall Street and put pressure on the dollar. The technology-focused Nasdaq index and the broad-based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index both dropped to their lowest points of the year, with share prices in Tokyo, London and Frankfurt taking their lead from New York's woes. Overnight, the Nikkei-Dow in Japan fell by more than 200 points to just below 14,000, close to its lowest for 10 years. The sell-off continued in Europe, where London's FTSE 100 closed down 118.3 points at 6176.7, before rippling back to the US where all the main share-price indices suffered heavy early losses. By lunchtime in New York, the Nasdaq Composite was down 6%, dropping more than 150 points to 2360.99, while the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average was more than 162 points lower at 10,422 points and the S&amp;P 500 lost 32 points to 1273.53.

Cisco Systems, the networking group, led Nasdaq's fall, with its shares shedding more than 11% to touch a fresh year's low of $36.50 after Merrill Lynch cut its investment rating, blaming a slowdown in technology spending. The panic in the equity market, driven by worries about the outlook for corporate profits as the economy slows, helped boost demand for US government securities. \"The Nasdaq is hitting new lows and the Dow is off nearly 200 points,\" said Michael Maurer, debt strategist at AG Edwards. \"It's a mess out there so there is a flight to safety going on.\" On the foreign exchanges, the euro rose to its highest against the dollar since August. \"In an environment where relative growth performances are the dominant theme, the risk of a faster downturn in the US and concern that the Fed may not be moving quickly enough does not look very good for the dollar,\" said Chase economist Malcolm Barr. \"Financial markets got the verbiage confirming that the Fed sees the risks of slowdown - but then the Fed did not follow up with a rate cut.\" There was some speculation in the markets that the Fed could cut interest rates be tween meetings of its open market committee - a tactic it has used in the past- but analysts suggested that such action could smack of panic, adding to market uncertainty. President-elect George W Bush's decision to nominate Paul O'Neill, the boss of aluminium group Alcoa, as treasury secretary had little impact on the foreign exchange markets. The improvement in the euro - helped by projections from the European central bank indicating that the 11-nation single currency zone is on track for a modestly lower but still encouraging growth over the next two years - was welcomed by European policymakers.

Bill Morris, the transport union leader, likened Mr Hague's stance to Enoch Powell's \"rivers of blood\" speech in 1968, and dismay was expressed by Steven Norris, the Conservative party vice-chairman who has been outspoken in support of racial and sexual inclusivity.</p> <p>Gurbux Singh, chair of the commission for racial equality, has warned Mr Hague against \"throwing away\" the good race relations built up in Britain, while the bishop of Southwark, Tom Butler, has turned on him for making political capital out of the Macpherson report.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The race row engulfing the Tories intensified last night after a shadow cabinet minister was forced to apologise for telling a joke that was both racist and sexist. Liam Fox, the shadow health secretary and an increasingly prominent frontbencher, was told to apologise by William Hague's office after the joke, told at a Christmas party, found its way into the Guardian's Diary column. Conservative central office stressed that Mr Hague had not demanded the apology, but the fact it was pushed for hints at the Tories' sensitivity over allegations that they are willing to play the race card. At the party, held on Monday night by his colleague, the shadow foreign secretary Francis Maude, Dr Fox asked fellow guests: \"What do you call three dogs and a blackbird?\" Receiving no response, he supplied the answer: \"The Spice Girls.\" Yesterday he issued a statement apologising for the joke, which he repeated at the party and uttered in the presence of journalists. \"In repeating a widely circulated joke, I very much regret if anyone was offended,\" the statement read. \"I naturally apologise if any offence was caused.\" Last night, Dr Fox was unavailable for comment, and an aide said he did not know if the apology amounted to an admission that the joke was sexist and racist. The apology came just days after Dr Fox's leader, Mr Hague, sparked the current race storm when he claimed that Sir William Macpherson's description of the Metropolitan police as \"institutionally racist\" had led to a decline in morale among officers. While the Tory leader rejected claims that he was playing the race card as \"truly disgusting and disgraceful\", his comments drew fierce criticism. Bill Morris, the transport union leader, likened Mr Hague's stance to Enoch Powell's \"rivers of blood\" speech in 1968, and dismay was expressed by Steven Norris, the Conservative party vice-chairman who has been outspoken in support of racial and sexual inclusivity. Gurbux Singh, chair of the commission for racial equality, has warned Mr Hague against \"throwing away\" the good race relations built up in Britain, while the bishop of Southwark, Tom Butler, has turned on him for making political capital out of the Macpherson report.",

      "bodyText": "A shocked Neil Hamilton said he was \"utterly perplexed\" by the high court's decision to turn down his appeal against last year's 'cash for questions' libel action. A bitter Mr Hamilton said outside the court: \"This is the most bizarre and unexpected of results. \"I came to this court to prove that Fayed was a willing participant in the purchase of documents stolen from my lawyers.\" In the appeal, Mr Hamilton accused Mr Al Fayed of \"gross impropriety\" at the time of the trial, alleging that - unknown to his legal team - he was involved in paying \u00a310,000 for stolen legal documents taken from dustbins outside the chambers of Mr Hamilton's lawyers. He said he had proved that involvement and the part played by a \"henchman\" in the break-ins. \"I had assumed that if one had proved a case one would have won,\" he added. Mr Hamilton said he had been put in an \"impossible situation\" because he could never cross-examine a jury about their reasons for reaching their decision because it was forbidden in law. Mr Hamilton, standing next to his wife Christine, said he was now consulting his lawyers about taking his case to the European Court of Justice. \"I have been fighting this case for six and a quarter years and I cannot believe that this is English justice,\" he said. His formidable wife, Christine, was virtually speechless, on the steps of the high court. Looking sombre and anxious, she said: \"I feel as though I have been punched in the stomach and robbed. I am pretty speechless as you can see. \"I feel physically sick.\"",

Big blue boxes with strange writing that children will pass without a hint of curiosity or desire. But right now, a few days before Christmas, these same boxes are of indescribable value. They contain what every small boy wants: Tracy Island. </p> <p>It is a plastic re-creation of the Tracy family's island home in the long-running children's TV puppet show, Thunderbirds. And it is this year's must-have toy. What is more, last weekend I achieved the seemingly impossible. Using extraordinary levels of cunning and dedication I tracked a Tracy Island down and bought it for my son. Brains would have been proud of me. I now consider myself a good parent. </p> <p>It is not the children who have created the shortage that has led to emergency airfreight supplies and round-the-clock assembly lines. It is fathers like me who are the real problem, because after months of Buzz Lightyear and all the nonsense about \"to infinity and beyond\", boys are finally talking our language. That's why we have to buy Tracy Island: Thunderbirds are back and it's FAB. </p> <p>Hence the mayhem that has gripped toy stores up and down the country. Two weeks ago, a fight broke out in Harrods, of all places, after two shoppers each made a grab for the last remaining Tracy Island. Hamleys has been reduced to handing out tickets - 50 a day - to parents queuing outside the store. All because we obsessives will not be denied. And, believe me, m'lady, you can still get one for Christmas. Nothing is impossible in Thunderbirds - and the manufacturers are delivering 20,000 TIs to shops this week. </p> <p>My own mission began in Bentalls in Kingston on Friday morning. At this early stage I hadn't quite clocked on how desperate you have to be to get hold of one. I knew there weren't supposed to be many around, but that was all probably manufacturer's hype, right? Wrong. </p> <p>Rule one is to plan your operation like an International Rescue mission: there is no margin for error. I arrived at the shop two hours after a consignment of 60 TIs had arrived. And they had all disappeared from the shelves within minutes of delivery. The girl behind the counter said they did not expect any more before Christmas. But do not be put off if this happens to you: experienced Tracy Island hunters know this is a ruse to prevent mission accomplishment. </p> <p>It was the same story at John Lewis: \"You must be joking sir.\" And Toys'R'Us: \"We're not saying when we expect any more in\". After two hours, I spotted a Thunderbirds satchel, and wondered briefly whether that might do. It would not. I couldn't have my boy arrive at school with a naff satchel, to be confronted with a load of Tracy Islands, bought by parents who really cared. </p> <p>By Saturday morning I had discovered rule two: find out delivery times. I was up much earlier. None of this arriving at 11am nonsense. I was through the door at Selfridges at 9.30am, straight up the escalator to the toy department, and on to the counter. There were already people circling round. There was a rumour, no more than that, of a delivery at 11am, although the manageress was not sure if they would be put out \"for security reasons\". And so a group of us waited, surreptitiously eyeing each other with looks of quiet desperation. </p> <p>Eleven came and went before the formal announcement that no Tracy Islands would go on sale before 5pm. The girl on the cuddly-toy counter beckoned me over and whispered that the smart thing to do was to return at 4.30pm because they might put them out early to fool everybody. I thanked her over-enthusiastically and failed to pass on the information (rule three: never help the opposition). </p> <p>The street-smart among us knew that no matter what the manageress said, the big bosses might pull a fast one. That's why we didn't fall for the line about Tracy Islands going on sale at the main counter. We knew the rush would be too great. No, we kept our eyes open (rule four), and sure enough, at 4.47pm - 13 minutes early - I saw a discreet queue forming 50 yards from the toy department. There were 42 on sale, and they were snapped up before anyone else worked out what we were about. </p> <p>The only delay was caused by the elderly lady in front of me who almost broke down in tears when told that purchases were restricted to one per person. She wanted two, one for each grandson, and admitted defeat only when they threatened to evict her. They said she could rejoin the queue after buying her first, but by then it was hopeless - the word was out. I wouldn't like to be in her house on Christmas Day. </p> <p>All of which brings us to rule five: it's probably worth it. I know this because, for reasons that are too complicated to go into, my son has already opened his present this year and spent the entire weekend playing with it. Or rather we both did. It doesn't matter that the Thunderbird 2 I had 30-odd years ago was metal, and his is plastic. Or that his speaks, and mine didn't. He knows that Daddy used to have one, and that's why he likes it more than Buzz Lightyear, which doesn't get me off the armchair. </p> <p>I suspect he is aware that nothing else will move me in quite the same way. He is right, because next year when he is desperate for a digitally-enhanced Harry Potter model (having seen the film, of course) I shall not be in the market place.

Mr Hamilton, who was in the Court of Appeal today with his wife, Christine, wanted Lord Phillips, the Master of the Rolls, Lord Justice Sedley and Lady Justice Hale to set aside the verdict and enter judgment for him.

The Hamiltons showed no emotion at the announcement of the judgment which in effect was a refusal of permission to bring an appeal against the jury's unanimous verdict. Mr Hamilton had sued over claims made by Mr Al Fayed in a January 1997 Channel 4 Dispatches programme that he had corruptly demanded and accepted cash payments, gift vouchers and a free holiday at the Paris Ritz in return for asking parliamentary questions on behalf of Harrods. Today, Lord Phillips, the Master of the Rolls, Lord Justice Sedley and Lady Justice Hale made no order for costs arising out of the appeal but lifted \"stays\" on costs orders relating to the trial which means that Mr Hamilton must now contemplate meeting an estimated \u00a32m costs bill and the loss of his home at Nether Alderley, Cheshire. In the appeal, Mr Hamilton accused Mr Al Fayed of \"gross impropriety\" at the time of the trial, alleging that - unknown to his legal team - he was involved in paying \u00a310,000 for stolen legal documents taken from dustbins outside the chambers of Mr Hamilton's lawyers. Lord Phillips said today that the court had concluded \"that the appeal which Mr Hamilton has sought permission to bring against the verdict in this case would have no reasonable prospect of success and that his application in that regard should be dismissed\". He ruled that Mr Al Fayed's conduct in relation to the documents was \"discreditable\". But, he added: \"It did not, in fact, impact upon the way in that he, let alone his legal representatives, conducted his defence.\"",

Paul Winder, from Chelmsford, Essex, and Tom Hart Dyke, from Eynsford, Kent, said they had been taken hostage after stumbling across the rebels while hunting for rare species of orchid. The two men flew into Gatwick at around 2pm today for an emotional reunion with their families. Mr Hart Dyke's father Guy said: \"This is the best Christmas present we could have hoped for.\" Mr Hart Dyke had not seen his family since he set off on a round-the-world trip in November 1997. Wearing flip-flops and jeans, he said: \"It is fantastic, unbelievable to be back on British soil.\" Looking tired but pleased to be home Mr Hart Dyke, 24, said he had been frightened during the ordeal but that there had been moments of camaraderie with the guerrillas. The two men emerged from the rainforest on Tuesday after trekking through wilderness for eight days following their unexpected release on December 10. Describing their capture, Mr Hart Dyke said: \"They had us on the floor with our hands tied up. \"Initially they used their guns to get us on to the ground, they tied us up for half an hour and said 'are you going to run?' \"After that it never happened again.\" He said they had been well looked after by their captors, who had fed them well and even built a bed with cushions for them to lie on. Mr Hart Dyke said he had put on weight during the ordeal after being fed large amounts of beef and bananas. At one point the rebels had told them that they wanted a ransom. \"They did mention that we had to pay a ransom and they said $5m [\u00a33.3m] for each person,\" Mr Winder, 29, said. \"There were low times, high times, terrifying times and fantastic times. \"It was a huge rollercoaster of emotion,\" he added.

The agency, which has 10m holidays on its database, is trying to boost sales at a time when there is growing scepticism about the online booking market. The First Resort, in which tour operator Thomson owns a 30% share and Channel 5 a minority stake, is deliberately launching the deal in January - the peak holiday booking period. Matthew Prior, The First Resort managing director, said: \"We are looking to shake up the travel market with the first ever price-beating promotion on summer holidays.\" The brand will run heavy TV advertising and programme sponsorship during Channel 5's Christmas Day and Boxing Day schedules. It is believed to be the first time any company has guaranteed to discount every holiday on the market. The company's gamble comes just days after British Airways pulled the plug on Project Quicksilver, its internet portal aimed at Executive Club members. Meanwhile the share price of high-profile leisure brand Lastminute.com continues to fall. Forrester Research said it was downgrading growth in the online travel sector. Analyst Shobhit Kakkar said earlier forecasts of \u00a34bn of online bookings by 2005 were \"over optimistic\". He expected only \u00a3600m of holidays to have been booked online by the end of 2000. Forrester says that while 7% of UK consumers have booked flights online, only 2% have booked holidays in this way. The First Resort said it will undercut like-for-like holidays departing between May and October 2001 and booked by 31 January, by \u00a320 per booking. Despite being branded an online agency, Prior said almost all The First Resort's holidays required a phone call to an operator and that it was now repositioning itself as a 'multi-channel travel agent'.",

      "bodyText": "Vodafone has rounded off its Christmas shopping spree with a \u00a32.8bn acquisition of Irish rival Eircell. The deal comes just days after the world's largest mobile phone company splashed out \u00a31.5bn on a 15% stake in Japan Telecom. Ireland's mobile market is the third-fastest growing in western Europe, with Eircell's market share standing at around 60%. Julian Horn-Smith, Vodafone chief executive, said: \"Vodafone is adding more than 1.2m customers to its base in an attractive mobile market with a high proportion of young people and a fast-growing population.\" However, analysts are concerned that Vodafone has once again used new shares to clinch the deal. Around 10% of Vodafone's stock is comprised of these shares, and their potential sale has kept down the company's stock market value. The deal continues Vodafone's rivalry with BT, which owns 51% of Esat Digifone, Eircell's closest competitor. Both companies are already vying for control of Japan Telecom, which is seen as the perfect gateway to the world's most mature mobile phone market.",

      "body": "<b>What is Alzheimer's disease?</b> <br> Alzheimer's is a degenerative brain disorder that affects 600,000 people in Britain. Symptoms include memory loss, language deterioration, poor judgment and indifferent attitude - a sufferer loses much of what makes them who they are. It is the most widespread form of dementia and, although sufferers can be under 40-years-old, it is especially prevalent among the elderly. <p><b>What causes it? </b> <br> Nobody is certain and, as yet, there is no cure. The disease was discovered in 1906 by Alois Alzheimer, a German doctor, who noticed microscopic clumps and tangles in the brain tissue of a woman who had died of an unusual mental illness. These clumps, or plaques, are believed to block sufferers' ability to learn and remember.</p> <p><b>What is the breakthrough? </b> <br> Neuroscientists at Edinburgh university have carried out an experiment which, they say, distinguishes between recent memories (the kind Alzheimer's sufferers find hard to keep) and those from early in life, which do not cause as much trouble. </p> <p><b>What was it? </b> <br> Mice were put in an elaborate water maze where the exits kept changing. Those with raised levels of a protein called beta-amyloid, thought to cause the clumps in an Alzheimer's sufferers' brain, got confused and found it harder to remember the exits than the mice with less. All the mice were fine when the escape location did not change.</p> <p><b>What did it show? </b> <br> That the clumps associated with the protein beta-amyloid block short term memories but do not affect those from earlier in life. This is consistent with Alzheimer's disease - a relationship that had until now eluded researchers.</p> <p><b>So how can a vaccine help? </b> <br> Researchers in Toronto and Florida have found that brain clumps clear in affected mice who are vaccinated against the protein. Significantly, the mice are protected against further decline and in both experiments demonstrated improved memories.</p> <p><b> How long until it's available for people? </b> <br> At least five years. The vaccine is undergoing safety trials on humans but, as with any similar discovery, the dissimilarity of mice and men means that the vaccine may have an unexpected affect on humans.

      "bodyText": "What is Alzheimer's disease? Alzheimer's is a degenerative brain disorder that affects 600,000 people in Britain. Symptoms include memory loss, language deterioration, poor judgment and indifferent attitude - a sufferer loses much of what makes them who they are. It is the most widespread form of dementia and, although sufferers can be under 40-years-old, it is especially prevalent among the elderly. What causes it? Nobody is certain and, as yet, there is no cure. The disease was discovered in 1906 by Alois Alzheimer, a German doctor, who noticed microscopic clumps and tangles in the brain tissue of a woman who had died of an unusual mental illness. These clumps, or plaques, are believed to block sufferers' ability to learn and remember. What is the breakthrough? Neuroscientists at Edinburgh university have carried out an experiment which, they say, distinguishes between recent memories (the kind Alzheimer's sufferers find hard to keep) and those from early in life, which do not cause as much trouble. What was it? Mice were put in an elaborate water maze where the exits kept changing. Those with raised levels of a protein called beta-amyloid, thought to cause the clumps in an Alzheimer's sufferers' brain, got confused and found it harder to remember the exits than the mice with less. All the mice were fine when the escape location did not change. What did it show? That the clumps associated with the protein beta-amyloid block short term memories but do not affect those from earlier in life. This is consistent with Alzheimer's disease - a relationship that had until now eluded researchers. So how can a vaccine help? Researchers in Toronto and Florida have found that brain clumps clear in affected mice who are vaccinated against the protein. Significantly, the mice are protected against further decline and in both experiments demonstrated improved memories. How long until it's available for people? At least five years. The vaccine is undergoing safety trials on humans but, as with any similar discovery, the dissimilarity of mice and men means that the vaccine may have an unexpected affect on humans. Sceptics say that another protein, not beta-amyloid, may be responsible for the disease. What are the current treatments? Alzheimer's is a progressive disease, meaning it gets worse the longer a sufferer has it. The damage starts with mild memory problems and ends with severe mental damage. For some people in the early and middle stages of Alzheimer's, the drug Aricept may alleviate some symptoms but not halt the disease.

      "bodyText": "Sweeping reforms which aim to increase the number of children who are adopted by 40% over the next five years were announced by the health secretary, Alan Milburn, today. Under the proposals, children should have to wait no longer than six months for a family to be found for them. The government's white paper on adoption is designed to speed up the process and clear the backlog of more than 2,000 children waiting for a permanent home, with 1,200 families waiting to adopt. The proposals include a new national target to increase the number of adoptions by 40% by 2005. At present only 6,000 youngsters a year are adopted, compared with more than 20,000 in the 1960s. Shortages of potential adoptive families mean thousands of children are left in care homes for years while social workers try to find a home for them. The white paper aims to free up the process and set down new National Adoption Standards. Within six months of being in permanent care, children are to be given a plan for their future and, if it is decided that they should be adopted, a family found for them within six months. People have complained that the adoption process screens out suitable parents on the grounds of race or other criteria and stops thousands of children from being found a home. The proposals will give potential adopters the right to an independent review if their application is rejected. Mr Milburn said: \"Last year there were 2,400 children waiting to be adopted. These children need the safety, stability and loving care of a permanent new family. And they need that stability as quickly as possible. That is not the case at present. \"Children stay in the care system far longer than they should. Too often they are passed from pillar to post. These children deserve a better chance in life.\" To coincide with today's white paper, the prime minister, Tony Blair, spoke publicly about how his father Leo was fostered when his travelling entertainer parents left him with a couple they met on tour. Mr Blair, with his wife Cherie at his side, spoke about this at a meeting with a group of adopted children and their families. The prime minister has taken a personal interest in the adoption shakeup, chairing a cabinet committee which led to the introduction of new laws. After listening to the families' problems coping with the bureaucracy of the adoption system during an informal chat at the Coram Family Centre in St Pancras, north London, Mr Blair told the families: \"My own father was fostered.\" He added: \"In those days there weren't any rules at all. I don't think my grandmother would have passed any tests at all. \"But then a framework of rules grew up in a very random and ad-hoc way. Now is the right time to get back to basics and ask what we want to achieve for children.\" Later Mr Blair added: \"I know how much difference a loving and caring family made to me. My own father was adopted and not brought up by his own parents.\" Mr Blair's father Leo was the illegitimate son of travelling entertainers Celia Ridgeway and Charles Parsons. The social stigma of having a child out of wedlock and their hectic lifestyles prompted Leo's parents to give him to poor Clydesdale shipworker James Blair and his wife Mary, who they met on tour in Glasgow. Leo Blair went on to become a successful barrister, although his foster mother Mary prevented contact between him and his biological family. The prime minister's father was later reunited with his biological half-sister Pauline Harding.

      "body": "<p>Without Yoko Ono there would have been no Janov. She was the guiding force from about 1968 onwards. In agreeing to primal therapy, Lennon became the groom stripped bare by his suitor: it was Yoko who saw that he would have to stand naked before he could choose how he wanted to appear, to himself and others. It was also Yoko who spurred his interest in what used to be called avant-gardism. From the outset he was taken by the fact that she was a bona fide 'artist' in the sense that a rock and roll man is not. She had exhibition credits to her name and an eye for attractive ironies, drawn from Zen Buddhism and other oblique descriptive habits, whose origins lay well to the east of Maharishi country, and she could recast them as clever forms of New York minimalism. Her irony was evidence of something real, simple and true. She could stick an apple in an exhibition and ask for \u00a3200 to watch it decompose, somehow saying all that needed to be said about... what? The consumer society? The transience of matter? The Beatles? 'Here was someone,' Lennon remarks, 'that could turn me on to a million things.' He'd believed as much about the Maharishi, but he was in love with Yoko, and she with him. </p> <p>He was also in a fix about her work. It got up his nose and then he adored it and then again he didn't, but really he did. She was 'avant-garde' and she was 'underground', and these were conditions to which he aspired. Very admirable models in those days, and a fulcrum of sorts on which the hippy thing, and the rock and roll thing, could turn fitfully towards an education in history. By 1966, when he saw her work at the Indica Gallery in Mason's Yard, only Russ Conway and Mrs Mills were less underground than the Beatles; only Herman's Hermits and the Way In boutique at Harrods were less avant-garde. The exhibition appealed to the Lennon of In Your Own Write and A Spaniard in the Works (and to the Lennon of 'Don't Let Me down' waiting in the wings): </p> <p>'There was... a ladder which led to a painting which was hung on the ceiling. It looked like a black canvas with a chain with a spyglass hanging on the end of it. This was near the door when you went in. I climbed the ladder. You look through the spyglass and in tiny letters it says 'yes'. So it was positive. I felt relieved. It's a great relief when you get up the ladder and you look through the spyglass and it doesn't say 'no' or 'fuck you' or something, it said 'yes'.'</p> <p>He continued to be impressed and, in these interviews, he describes Yoko Ono as 'an intellectual', as though this was the source of his passion. But her case is more complex, as we can tell from a cursory glance at her CV. Zen Buddhism in postwar Japan was an anti-intellectual vogue and Yoko was very much a postwar person. Before the war, her father had worked overseas for the Yokohama Specie Bank and her early years were spent in San Francisco. She returned to Japan in 1937 at the age of five. Her mother took her back to San Francisco in 1940 and they went home in 1941. In March 1945, she survived the fire raid on Tokyo in the family bunker; her mother subsequently moved the children to a small village. After the war Yoko returned to school in Tokyo. All this is carefully explained by Murray Sayle in the catalogue of the Yes Yoko Ono exhibition in New York.'When Yoko and her classmates looked outside the school's high walls in the spring of 1946,' Sayle writes, 'they saw a city all but returned, as General Curtis LeMay had promised, to the Stone Age. Whole districts were sterile wastelands of twisted iron and blackened stones. People lived in holes clawed in the ground, roofed with stray sheets of metal... To sharpen the misery, American soldiers tootled around the ruins in jeeps.' </p> <p>John and Yoko's infatuation with 'peace' turns out to have particular origins, while 'bed' - the peace bed - can now be seen as a kind of body-polemic not just against Vietnam, but against two strange and distressing pasts. Hers the turmoil of Japanese warmongering and American occupation. His, more personally, the austere milieu of peacetime reconstruction, in Liverpool especially, followed by the dizzying propulsion out of that world during the economic boom of the early 1960s and onto the Lennon-McCartney treadmill. </p> <p>It was a roundabout case of West meets West. For, as Sayle points out, Zen Buddhism wasn't the only fashion in Japan during the brief cultural renaissance that followed defeat. There was also Dada, which had first reached Tokyo in the 1920s. The Dada of Hugo Ball and the Cabaret Voltaire had derived its health from the sickness of the Great War, but in Japan a few years later, it was simply a modish pudding in search of a proof. By the end of the Second World War, however, that was no longer the case and by the early 1960s, when Yoko returned to Tokyo after a decade in New York, she was exhibiting as part of a busy avant-garde which included a contingent of artists who thought of themselves as 'neo-Dadaists'. </p> <p>All this has a bearing on the revised John Lennon. For if any member of the Beatles had a hidden affinity with Yoko - in terms of a taste for odd little juxtapositions, contrived production values, associative leaps and natty bricolage, it was surely Paul McCartney, who powered the band through its two triumphant perversities, the 'White Album' and Abbey Road. He liked to dub and mix and fiddle about and counterpoint one song against the other. Lennon may have seemed more outr\u008e and inquisitive, and of course he wasn't averse to montage - 'Happiness Is a Warm Gun' was one of his favourite tracks - but if both men were intrigued by the tricks of the late Modernist trade, McCartney (who met Yoko before Lennon did) found them easier to transpose to pop music, while Lennon remained a little in awe of them, preferring them in galleries and books, including his own, with their cheery, paronomastic homage to the late Joyce. On the factory floor, so to speak, he hadn't the magpie instinct or the flair for asymmetry that went with the pop experiments of the period. In falling in love with Yoko, he fell for a more illustrious, less irritating version of McCartney. </p> <p>Yet on John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band, the great John Lennon album - and on much of what followed - the drift was emphatically unexperimental, autobiographical and expressive of John Himself. There simply was no interest in form as anything other than a means to that end. Fury about the death of Mama and the absence of Father ('Mother'); disdain transposed as funeral oration ('God'), thoroughgoing helplessness in love ('Look at Me'), likely-lad ressentiment ('Working-Class Hero') and so on. There's no arguing with the power of all these modes, the appeal to sympathy or the paradoxical achievement: the child's view of the world, so cherished in the 1960s, seems both to be recovered and irretrievably lost - Infant Joy flings all its toys out of the cot and goes into mourning, with one eye on survival and the clear space opening up ahead. There's nothing like it for another ten years, when Marianne Faithfull records Broken English. </p> <p>'I'm not just talking about the Beatles is over,' Lennon said of 'God': 'I'm talking about the generation thing. The dream's over, and I have personally got to get down to so-called reality.' But there was no great awakening in the 1970s, only a recasting of earlier enthusiasms. And though Lennon talked more openly about politics and hitched his wagon more conspicuously to causes, he was strangely wide of the mark. He believed, as only a millionaire could, that 'Working-Class Hero' was 'a revolutionary song' (true, inasmuch as it forecast the Thatcher revolution); he had half a mind to idolise Mao (a lot of people did, from Richard Nixon to Julia Kristeva). At the same time, by putting his name to the idea of peace, he became an asset to the anti-war movement in the US. But 'me' remained uppermost, as he felt it should for an artist - to that extent he was a slave of convention - and, in the end, 'me' was him all over, the best place he could have ended up. </p> <p>But, whoever one had become, being 'me' in the 1970s was no longer what it had been. By now, the pop-intellectual ideas of the self were at odds with one another and they'd grown more sophisticated. Feminism and 'men's groups' required a thorough remapping of 'me', and other pronouns. So did the sharp turn into the royal road of 'language' - with 'desire' bringing up the rear - which promised the revolution of the subject, and then a transformation of the world, almost by dint of radical representation alone. Language was the avant-garde's last big idea and Yoko Ono understood it better than Lennon. But ever since his exasperation with the Beatles, Lennon had kept a weather eye on what poets, artists, filmmakers and other musicians were doing. He studied the form. Whence his best remark of the interview - 'I'm a cin\u008ema-v\u008erit\u008e guitarist-musician' - which suggests that he saw the point of all this disparate and opaque activity, even if he thought that lowly, ragged rock and roll did something just as drastic and engaging. </p> <p>Elsewhere during the 1970s, older pop versions of 'me' seemed to consolidate. Not the extremist accounts of the damaged, beatific self in RD Laing and David Cooper, but a running tally of private hurt combined with an inventory of (equally private) need that thrived on a domestication of the visionary beliefs which gained currency in the 1960s. 'Alienation' was still being claimed as a negative human right and the celebration of the Hermann Hesse-like outsider - a wide-eyed, fragile soul, bullied into inconsequence by a brutish world - was common enough. It was okay to think of oneself as a china doll in Sparta. But the less Spartan the world became for the many prosperous survivors of the 1960s, the more insistent they seemed to be that the doll was traduced. Thirty years later, we have the four-wheel drive, assertiveness training and much else with which to pamper our dolls - and it's still possible to turn them into proto-radicals by clinging to the superstition that their every wish is by definition 'subversive'. </p> <p>To hold John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band accountable for this would be to 'get the therapy confused with the music'. The music is about the pain of John Winston Lennon, as described by the new John Ono Lennon, ex-sibling of the Beatles, also orphaned by his first family which, for the purposes of this record, is the one that mattered: child of the absent and the dead. The new screaming and wailing, by the pain-artist, is a stoical performance. Indeed, it could hardly be further from the anti-stoicism of the 1960s, which was based on pleasure and dissent. At the same time it's a milestone on the winding road towards a degraded anti-stoicism in which nothing is more interesting than injury, or puts us more at ease. </p> <p>As a loyal member of the multi-million artificial family that kept up an interest in black sheep, I still love John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band, and almost all the Beatles music, but it always puts me in mind of the many goings-on in the great concourse, as it was in the 1960s, with everyone swanning around under marshmallow skies - and of the ways people had of thinking they were all up to much the same thing. The openness of that great domain began to close around the time that Lennon discovered self-discovery in earnest. Structural cracks appeared in the fa\u008dades and these became fissures; screens went up, partitions were built, it suddenly felt like an enormous flat-conversion. 'Personal space' began to matter. </p> <p>Meanwhile, some kinds of politics, with which the hippy thing and the rock and roll thing could muddle along, began to achieve a healthy momentum that was too much for the freaks. They followed behind as best they could - especially in the US, largely because of the anti-war movement. But Haskell Wexler's movie, Medium Cool, set - and shot - at the Democratic Convention in Chicago in 1968 and released the following year, explains how fast things were changing, with five years of Vietnam to run. In Europe, it was La Chinoise and Weekend that infiltrated the land of magic mushrooms and patchouli. And before long the alliance of utopians, hedonists, anarchists and very satisfied music promoters that was tenuous enough at Woodstock seemed to come apart, with one tribe holding their copies of Steppenwolf and the other... I don't know, the new Penguin edition of The Wretched of the Earth or Eldridge Cleaver's Soul on Ice. </p> <p>Yet at the time of Lennon's murder in 1980, the concourse was under reconstruction. Everyone basked in the same life-giving warmth of market forces. In the Beatles generation, we could almost hear the strains of 'Good Day Sunshine' - very Paul McCartney - as we were decorously informed that the value of our share portfolios could go up as well as up. Some big ambitions had been reconfigured, the best things in life were undoubtedly for birds and bees, and cynicism, once a useful antidote to the old fantasies, was suddenly a badge of mediocrity. Lennon had a disagreeable wise guy side, but he was scarcely a cynic. </p> <p>Everyone knows where John Lennon died - the Dakota Apartments, a morose cultural march stolen on Walt Disney in 1884, half a century before Snow White or Dumbo, by the architect Henry Hardenberg. I was living quite close at the time. Someone rang in what seemed like the middle of the night and I lay awake with the light on, intent on proving that I really couldn't care less. Pretty much like the Maharishi in fact - 'fucking idiot.' The following morning I bought some roses on Broadway and trudged towards the scene, taking my place by the police barriers with the weeping crowds. It was a mortified version of that screaming and wailing again, painfully frank and, by now, rather subdued. No need to threaten anyone with a shoe. </p> <p>The longer I stayed, the stronger my dislike of the Dakota became. Even the flowers at its sinister gates took on the air of a tribute not to Lennon but to the building itself, which would sport this murder as a nasty feather in its cap, along with Rosemary's Baby and everything else. And it looked now as it was meant to look, scornfully unreal (un-simple, far from 'true'). You could imagine the fake thunderheads massing behind its towers as lightning rippled over Central Park. And all the while it lowered, like a cartoon palace in an out-take from Fantasia. Pepperland had finally been swallowed up by Disney and the man who wrote 'Strawberry Fields' had been claimed by America, the most voracious place on earth. </p> <p> \u0095 To read more online essays from the current edition of the London Review of Books visit the <a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/\">LRB</a>.

For if any member of the Beatles had a hidden affinity with Yoko - in terms of a taste for odd little juxtapositions, contrived production values, associative leaps and natty bricolage, it was surely Paul McCartney, who powered the band through its two triumphant perversities, the 'White Album' and Abbey Road. He liked to dub and mix and fiddle about and counterpoint one song against the other. Lennon may have seemed more outr\u008e and inquisitive, and of course he wasn't averse to montage - 'Happiness Is a Warm Gun' was one of his favourite tracks - but if both men were intrigued by the tricks of the late Modernist trade, McCartney (who met Yoko before Lennon did) found them easier to transpose to pop music, while Lennon remained a little in awe of them, preferring them in galleries and books, including his own, with their cheery, paronomastic homage to the late Joyce. On the factory floor, so to speak, he hadn't the magpie instinct or the flair for asymmetry that went with the pop experiments of the period. In falling in love with Yoko, he fell for a more illustrious, less irritating version of McCartney. Yet on John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band, the great John Lennon album - and on much of what followed - the drift was emphatically unexperimental, autobiographical and expressive of John Himself. There simply was no interest in form as anything other than a means to that end. Fury about the death of Mama and the absence of Father ('Mother'); disdain transposed as funeral oration ('God'), thoroughgoing helplessness in love ('Look at Me'), likely-lad ressentiment ('Working-Class Hero') and so on. There's no arguing with the power of all these modes, the appeal to sympathy or the paradoxical achievement: the child's view of the world, so cherished in the 1960s, seems both to be recovered and irretrievably lost - Infant Joy flings all its toys out of the cot and goes into mourning, with one eye on survival and the clear space opening up ahead. There's nothing like it for another ten years, when Marianne Faithfull records Broken English. 'I'm not just talking about the Beatles is over,' Lennon said of 'God': 'I'm talking about the generation thing. The dream's over, and I have personally got to get down to so-called reality.' But there was no great awakening in the 1970s, only a recasting of earlier enthusiasms. And though Lennon talked more openly about politics and hitched his wagon more conspicuously to causes, he was strangely wide of the mark. He believed, as only a millionaire could, that 'Working-Class Hero' was 'a revolutionary song' (true, inasmuch as it forecast the Thatcher revolution); he had half a mind to idolise Mao (a lot of people did, from Richard Nixon to Julia Kristeva). At the same time, by putting his name to the idea of peace, he became an asset to the anti-war movement in the US. But 'me' remained uppermost, as he felt it should for an artist - to that extent he was a slave of convention - and, in the end, 'me' was him all over, the best place he could have ended up. But, whoever one had become, being 'me' in the 1970s was no longer what it had been. By now, the pop-intellectual ideas of the self were at odds with one another and they'd grown more sophisticated. Feminism and 'men's groups' required a thorough remapping of 'me', and other pronouns. So did the sharp turn into the royal road of 'language' - with 'desire' bringing up the rear - which promised the revolution of the subject, and then a transformation of the world, almost by dint of radical representation alone. Language was the avant-garde's last big idea and Yoko Ono understood it better than Lennon. But ever since his exasperation with the Beatles, Lennon had kept a weather eye on what poets, artists, filmmakers and other musicians were doing. He studied the form. Whence his best remark of the interview - 'I'm a cin\u008ema-v\u008erit\u008e guitarist-musician' - which suggests that he saw the point of all this disparate and opaque activity, even if he thought that lowly, ragged rock and roll did something just as drastic and engaging. Elsewhere during the 1970s, older pop versions of 'me' seemed to consolidate. Not the extremist accounts of the damaged, beatific self in RD Laing and David Cooper, but a running tally of private hurt combined with an inventory of (equally private) need that thrived on a domestication of the visionary beliefs which gained currency in the 1960s. 'Alienation' was still being claimed as a negative human right and the celebration of the Hermann Hesse-like outsider - a wide-eyed, fragile soul, bullied into inconsequence by a brutish world - was common enough. It was okay to think of oneself as a china doll in Sparta. But the less Spartan the world became for the many prosperous survivors of the 1960s, the more insistent they seemed to be that the doll was traduced. Thirty years later, we have the four-wheel drive, assertiveness training and much else with which to pamper our dolls - and it's still possible to turn them into proto-radicals by clinging to the superstition that their every wish is by definition 'subversive'. To hold John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band accountable for this would be to 'get the therapy confused with the music'. The music is about the pain of John Winston Lennon, as described by the new John Ono Lennon, ex-sibling of the Beatles, also orphaned by his first family which, for the purposes of this record, is the one that mattered: child of the absent and the dead. The new screaming and wailing, by the pain-artist, is a stoical performance. Indeed, it could hardly be further from the anti-stoicism of the 1960s, which was based on pleasure and dissent. At the same time it's a milestone on the winding road towards a degraded anti-stoicism in which nothing is more interesting than injury, or puts us more at ease. As a loyal member of the multi-million artificial family that kept up an interest in black sheep, I still love John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band, and almost all the Beatles music, but it always puts me in mind of the many goings-on in the great concourse, as it was in the 1960s, with everyone swanning around under marshmallow skies - and of the ways people had of thinking they were all up to much the same thing. The openness of that great domain began to close around the time that Lennon discovered self-discovery in earnest. Structural cracks appeared in the fa\u008dades and these became fissures; screens went up, partitions were built, it suddenly felt like an enormous flat-conversion. 'Personal space' began to matter. Meanwhile, some kinds of politics, with which the hippy thing and the rock and roll thing could muddle along, began to achieve a healthy momentum that was too much for the freaks. They followed behind as best they could - especially in the US, largely because of the anti-war movement. But Haskell Wexler's movie, Medium Cool, set - and shot - at the Democratic Convention in Chicago in 1968 and released the following year, explains how fast things were changing, with five years of Vietnam to run. In Europe, it was La Chinoise and Weekend that infiltrated the land of magic mushrooms and patchouli. And before long the alliance of utopians, hedonists, anarchists and very satisfied music promoters that was tenuous enough at Woodstock seemed to come apart, with one tribe holding their copies of Steppenwolf and the other... I don't know, the new Penguin edition of The Wretched of the Earth or Eldridge Cleaver's Soul on Ice. Yet at the time of Lennon's murder in 1980, the concourse was under reconstruction. Everyone basked in the same life-giving warmth of market forces. In the Beatles generation, we could almost hear the strains of 'Good Day Sunshine' - very Paul McCartney - as we were decorously informed that the value of our share portfolios could go up as well as up. Some big ambitions had been reconfigured, the best things in life were undoubtedly for birds and bees, and cynicism, once a useful antidote to the old fantasies, was suddenly a badge of mediocrity. Lennon had a disagreeable wise guy side, but he was scarcely a cynic. Everyone knows where John Lennon died - the Dakota Apartments, a morose cultural march stolen on Walt Disney in 1884, half a century before Snow White or Dumbo, by the architect Henry Hardenberg. I was living quite close at the time. Someone rang in what seemed like the middle of the night and I lay awake with the light on, intent on proving that I really couldn't care less. Pretty much like the Maharishi in fact - 'fucking idiot.' The following morning I bought some roses on Broadway and trudged towards the scene, taking my place by the police barriers with the weeping crowds. It was a mortified version of that screaming and wailing again, painfully frank and, by now, rather subdued. No need to threaten anyone with a shoe. The longer I stayed, the stronger my dislike of the Dakota became. Even the flowers at its sinister gates took on the air of a tribute not to Lennon but to the building itself, which would sport this murder as a nasty feather in its cap, along with Rosemary's Baby and everything else. And it looked now as it was meant to look, scornfully unreal (un-simple, far from 'true'). You could imagine the fake thunderheads massing behind its towers as lightning rippled over Central Park. And all the while it lowered, like a cartoon palace in an out-take from Fantasia. Pepperland had finally been swallowed up by Disney and the man who wrote 'Strawberry Fields' had been claimed by America, the most voracious place on earth. \u0095 To read more online essays from the current edition of the London Review of Books visit the LRB.

Rolling Stone published the interview early the following year, with the album already in the shops. Between them, the record and the interview seemed to round off the 1960s nicely - or nastily, come to that. Many things seemed to do the same, of course, but in this case the dating was pretty precise. It was ten years since John, Paul, George and Ringo had recorded their first session together at the Akustik, a small studio in Hamburg (apparently a single 78 rpm copy of 'Summertime' still survives); and Lennon's declaration that 'the dream isover' in 'God', track ten on John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band, felt like a speech from the heart at the last-ever anniversary party. </p> <p>What makes the Lennon interview rewarding second time around is not that this is an interviewer's cut, so to speak - very little of interest was excised for the magazine edition: it's simply that the perplexing contradictions it revealed at the time seem easier to grasp in retrospect. They're still interesting: rock and roll fundamentalism v. avant-gardism; therapy v. politics; and, above all for Lennon, John v. the Beatles and all they stood for. It's also clear that this clever man profited from his relationship with Yoko Ono, who served his purposes in serving her own. Under her guidance, he became both a public solipsist and something of a radical - affirming the paramount value of being John before going on to adopt the campaigning postures of the 1970s: anti-war, anti-consumerism, anti-Nixon, anti-clericalism, a brief bout of workerism, 'power to the people' and so on. </p> <p>It was rickety stuff, but for most of the time he meant it, and within a few years of his liaison with Yoko, he had graduated from the knowing boy of the 1960s to the naive man-child we associate with his last years. 'Imagine' - his transnational anthem of 1971 - is typical of the new universalist peering out through smoked-glass spectacles. Direct, fantastical, awash with grandeur and schmaltz, and apparently harmless, it might nowadays have been commissioned for a Vodafone ad. Even so, it must have had an edge to it when Lennon performed it at a benefit for the relatives of inmates killed by police after the Attica State Prison riot in 1971 and it was BBC policy, nearly twenty years later, to keep it off the air for the duration of the Gulf War.</p> <p> For the rest, the John Lennon story is a tortuous family affair, in many intersecting senses of the term, and it's remained so, largely because the heyday of his avatar, John Beatle, and of his three siblings, must for commercial reasons be extended for as long as possible. But early on, everyone sensed that there was something distinctive about Lennon. In my family and others I knew, the Beatles met with condescending parental approval, and so it was natural to view them with suspicion. In 1966, when the press got hold of Lennon's 'bigger than Jesus' remark, he became a villain, at least where I grew up - one of a mixed bunch of Labour ministers, student revolutionaries and TV personalities (including, for some reason, the variety pianists Russ Conway and Mrs Mills). In the Home Counties, the maxim 'Know your enemy' was applied with latitude and as Lennon entered the pantheon of hate figures - a medium to al dente subversive whose name was reviled at gymkhanas and golf tournaments around the county - he rose in our esteem. </p> <p>I find it odd, but not surprising, that he's once again a family man - in my family at any rate. In the last two years I've reinvested in the productions of Mopheads Inc at the request of two boys under the age of six for whom the death of the person who didn't 'believe in Beatles' is so significant that it determines most of what they know or think about music. (For example: 'Who is this music by?' 'Johann Sebastian Bach.' 'Is he dead?' 'Yes.' 'Was he shot?') Striking, too, that in the run-and-run saga of the Beatles, we can't get away from the band and they can't get away from each other. It's as though they'd been condemned to an eternity of group therapy without a counsellor, a slanging match between the living and the dead, while younger admirers, plunderers and acolytes-at-one-remove, like Blur and the Gallaghers, pin messages of sympathy to the door of the consulting room. And then, quite easily, that little room begins to expand in a dream-like distortion until it's a vast concourse that appears to contain us all. Here, every thought or memory, however private, comes complete with a transfiguring riff by Lennon and McCartney. The stores are decorated with Pepperland hangings, the sun shines like a cartoon sun, the coffee machines play 'Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da' and mobile phones ring with a digitised version of 'Penny Lane'. Another family affair, on a much larger scale. 'Very strange.' </p> <p>Not so strange, perhaps, is Lennon's wish, from the late 1960s, to have done with this ever-extending artificial family. Neither is the fact that he failed to do so. On the face of it, the relationship with Yoko Ono was a more intimate venture, but it was also extraordinarily stagey and public. And 'the public' - that's us - was part of the baggage Lennon carried with him. We went as an enormous cast of pseudo-cousins, adopted brothers and sisters. We didn't have to concur with his snide (and amusing) remarks about the other Beatles: it was more a case of taking an interest in a new branch of the family, a divagation of an extreme kind that was sometimes hard to put up with. </p> <p>There were memorable lows - among them, 'Don't Worry Kyoko' and 'John, John', Yoko's contributions to the Plastic Ono Band's Live Peace in Toronto 1969 - but you could always spin back to Rubber Soul or Revolver for a big family get-together, repatriating Lennon to the land from which he'd done a very noisy runner. 'That... album with the drawing by Klaus Voorman on it,' he asks Jann Wenner apropos Revolver. 'Was that before Rubber Soul or after?' Nowadays, too, the happy family solution's at hand, with both those albums somewhere in the upper layer of chaos spread around the tape deck of the car. But as younger consumers in the Beatles Emporium come 'onstream', lapping up the recordings of the mid-1960s and imagining that Bach was wasted on the way to choir practice, one longs for a break in the story and a breather from the Beatlish-Lennonish mixture of knowing chic and know-nothing bonhomie which little boys seem to find as seductive as their mothers and fathers did. </p> <p>But perhaps not their grandparents, in whose eyes Lennon had blown it by becoming the person he is in this interview: self-engrossed, witty, malicious, foolish - someone who is always ready to be disabused and reabused, obstinately drawn to contending kinds of ruin, aloft between frying pan and fire and flipping like a dervish pancake, yet equally convinced of a redemptive universe which has delivered him safe and sound into the arms of Yoko Ono ('nothing works better than to have somebody you love hold you'). A confused figure waging several wars at once and taking no prisoners. An attractive figure, I find, and a model of frankness. This is a person gloriously incapable of circumspection. </p> <p>Even so, he has a project, which comes into focus early on in the interview: the articulation of a revitalised John Lennon, a chip off the old block certainly, but a New Man, too, replenished with the old values of rock and roll; a pain-artist with a Promethean gift to offer (rock and roll again, in its raw form, without the dinky, mediating talents of the Beatles) and a Promethean sacrifice to make: this welcome ordeal is forecast in 'Yer Blues' on the 'White Album' (1968), where the liver's left alone, but the eagle goes straight for the eyes - vision itself, a Lennonologist would tell you. </p> <p>This notion of the rock and roll performer going back to what he knows best is opposed to what the made-over Lennon describes as 'that sort of dead Beatles sound or dead recording sound', a multitude of tracks laid down under the supervision of George Martin and Paul McCartney. And not long after the old production values have come under fire, so has the material itself. Again, the issue is mediation, a lack of feeling or veracity in the fanciful little narratives - 'Eleanor Rigby' comes to mind - that stormed up the charts but had nothing to do with the business of speaking one's mind and singing one's soul. </p> <p>From this morass of trivia, apparently, the new, discerning Lennon rescues his best songs, his 'me' songs: 'In My Life', 'I'm a Loser', 'Help!', 'Strawberry Fields' ('all personal records'). 'They were the ones that I really wrote from experience and not projecting myself into a situation and writing a nice story about it, which I always found phony' - 'third-person songs about people who lived in concrete flats and things'. The emphasis now is on a music that comes from the inside, no virtuosity, none of the courtesies of 'projection', no more correlative niceties. Instead, a 'first-person music', bubbling forth from the self in anguish, revealed at last, like a run of leaking pipes with the lagging triumphantly torn away. </p> <p>It's stretching it a bit to describe 'In My Life' or 'Strawberry Fields' as rock and roll, but perhaps it's a manner of speaking as well as an expression of narrow allegiance. What matters is how to be John Lennon with a minimum of interference and rock and roll does a lot of work on this front. It also puts everyone in their place. </p> <p>'What do your personal tastes run to?'</p> <p>'Wop bop a loo bop. You know?... I don't like much else.'</p> <p>'Why rock and roll?'</p> <p>'That's the music that inspired me to play... There's nothing conceptually better than rock and roll. No group, be it Beatles, Dylan or Stones, has ever improved on 'Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' on' for my money.' Rock and roll sorts you out, then; like a therapy, it helps to distinguish the real you from the specious ones. And, of course, it's by means of this distinction that you're able to identify the good songs you wrote and the not-so-good songs, which is how you elect a song like 'Strawberry Fields' to the canon. It is by you and about you and about what you felt. What it has in common with 'Money' or 'Dizzy Miss Lizzy' (there are good renditions of both these standards on Live Peace in Toronto) is lack of adornment, and the quality of something properly authentic, an encounter in which the material has come readily to the composer, presenting itself in the form of an abundant natural resource: the opposite of the synthetic rummage-and-collage process that begins in 1967 with 'A Day in the Life' on Sgt Pepper and goes on through the 'White Album' to Abbey Road (1969). 'Real', 'true' and 'simple' are Lennon's catch-all descriptions of what he's after. On rock and roll again: 'You recognise something in it that is true, like all true art. Whatever art is, readers. Okay? It's that. If it's real, it's simple usually. And if it's simple, it's true. Something like that.' </p> <p>These remarks are by way of priming - maybe bracing - both himself and his fans for the forthcoming album. And in December 1970, with the record finished but not yet released, it's as though everything will stand or fall on this piece of work. The ground needs preparing for its reception -'people have to be hyped in a way, they've got to have it presented to them in all the best ways possible' - and a certain amount needs to be said about the real and the unreal, about the unpacking of the self and the recovery of the authentic John Lennon. Fans must also be readied for the album's hair-raising combination of fury and defencelessness - and for my money (as Lennon liked to say), 'Look at Me' is as good as any other song he elects to the party of simplicity, reality and truth. Much of the interview, then, is about the distresses and rewards of his self-revelation, under the tutelage of Yoko Ono and - from April 1970, when he embarked on primal therapy - Arthur Janov, author of The Primal Scream. These are the new and more helpful Maharishis chaperoning John towards his irreducible core of Lennonness. </p> <p>The old mentor is reviled. So is the stab at self-abandon, in the form of meditation, a natural place to have gone with LSD, hard on the heels of Brian Epstein's death in 1967 ('I thought: \"We've fuckin' had it\"'), but it didn't work out. It was a fraud masterminded by an earthly purveyor of cosmic wisdom who splashed his transcendental pheromones around the ashram, or whatever it was, every time he set eyes on Mia Farrow or her sister Prudence, all the while raking it in, courtesy of John, the three siblings and their girls. On the double album, the Maharishi becomes 'Sexy Sadie' - 'You made a fool of everyone' - and here, in one of several parting shots, Lennon describes how the news of Epstein's death reached the Beatles as they were set to attend a lecture by the Maharishi in Bangor. It was probably the moment that propelled Lennon to India, and it's revisited in that faintly hysterical, yet deeply economical style that reduces the world to a three-way contest between pain, intelligence and cant. The press said: '\"Brian's dead.\" I was stunned. We all were. And the Maharishi - we went into him, \"He's dead,\" and all that. And he was sort of saying: \"Oh, forget it, be happy.\" Fucking idiot.' </p> <p>Arthur Janov was a huge improvement. Sadie had shed no light, after all, on Lennon's feelings for his first family, the real disaster waiting to happen on the steps of Mount Pleasant Register Office, Liverpool, in December 1938, two years before he was born. The album proved that Janov could help him feel his way around the business of Freddy, the absconded father ('I wanted you but you didn't want me'), and Julia, the dead mother ('you had me but I never had you'). Janov also seems to have come up with a cure for the cure (screaming as the remedy for meditation), which must have posed a serious challenge. </p> <p>The most pressing issue was surely that Lennon had been boxed into a world of fantastic disproportion. With millions of people doting on your songs - the ones you like and the others you don't - you could be forgiven for thinking your difficulties were more than merely personal. Inasmuch as the real you was being consumed, understood or misunderstood across about a quarter of the earth's non-marine surface (plus a few bobbing pirate radio stations), your problems could be said to have a global dimension. And with the teachings of the Maharishi kicking in, and then out, it would all have taken on another dimension still. You may not have remained at one with the universe, but somehow the erstwhile notion that you became it by being part of it, then all of it, and that it became you in microcosm, would have left you feeling that immense forces were in play when you tried to figure out who you were. </p> <p>Janov was more usefully parochial. The thing to do with the 'self' was to shuck it, like something on a seafood platter, get 'in touch' with the injured child and redeem that injury with a primal enactment of pain. Lennon took to Janov, and after the embarrassing remark, 'We primal almost daily,' he disposes of the therapy quite honourably, refusing to betray it or allow it to betray him. In explaining what it was and how it worked, he contrives to strip it of babble, i.e. to Lennonise it. 'Primal therapy allowed us to feel feelings continually, and those feelings usually make you cry. That's all.' Whatever the vices of simplicity, they're hard to finger here. </p> <p>Lennon had called John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band 'the first primal album', but screaming and wailing were already modes that he knew well before his sessions with Janov. For years, the fans had been screaming and wailing and fainting wherever the Beatles went, and like spent witchfinders huddling in their cowls, the band would beat a retreat from this Devils of Loudun sound-effect to their blowsy cars and hotel suites. (I saw them at the Hammersmith Odeon around the time they released Beatles for Sale - 1964, I suppose. The screaming was so wild that my 12-year-old soulmate removed his shoe and threatened the girls in front, but they were intent on burning at the stake.) Screaming, too, was part of the band's act. 'Pain and screaming was before Janov,' Lennon says. 'Listen to \"Twist and Shout\"' - an Isley Brothers cover - 'I couldn't sing the damn thing. I was just screaming. Listen to\"a wop bop a loo bop a wop bam boom\"' - a Little Richard vocal line (garbled) from 'Tutti Frutti'. 'Don't get the therapy confused with the music.' And what's true (and 'simple' and 'real') of the voice is also true of the instrument: </p> <p>'How do you rate yourself as a guitarist?'</p> <p>'Well, it depends what kind of guitarist... '</p> <p>'Rock and roll.'</p> <p>'I'm okay. I'm not technically very good, but I can make it fucking howl and move.' Janov, then, is a way station - a 'mirror', as the unexpurgated Yoko now interjects - like all Lennon's 'phases'. Matters are reassessed; there's a pause from the general exhaustion, perhaps the first real pause since Hamburg, and a retrospective. A narrative order is impressed on the junkheap of fame and talent; John learns how to get 'centred'; scores are settled, good jokes are made; ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/lrb/articles/0,6109,414551,00.html\">Read part two here</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Lennon Remembers: The Complete Rolling Stone Interviews by Jann Wenner. Verso, 151 pp., \u00a320, 9 October 2000, 1 85984 600 9 Buy it at BOL John Lennon gave his famous interview to Jann Wenner of Rolling Stone magazine at the end of 1970, a few days before the release of the most important solo-Beatle record, John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band. Rolling Stone published the interview early the following year, with the album already in the shops. Between them, the record and the interview seemed to round off the 1960s nicely - or nastily, come to that. Many things seemed to do the same, of course, but in this case the dating was pretty precise. It was ten years since John, Paul, George and Ringo had recorded their first session together at the Akustik, a small studio in Hamburg (apparently a single 78 rpm copy of 'Summertime' still survives); and Lennon's declaration that 'the dream isover' in 'God', track ten on John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band, felt like a speech from the heart at the last-ever anniversary party. What makes the Lennon interview rewarding second time around is not that this is an interviewer's cut, so to speak - very little of interest was excised for the magazine edition: it's simply that the perplexing contradictions it revealed at the time seem easier to grasp in retrospect. They're still interesting: rock and roll fundamentalism v. avant-gardism; therapy v. politics; and, above all for Lennon, John v. the Beatles and all they stood for. It's also clear that this clever man profited from his relationship with Yoko Ono, who served his purposes in serving her own. Under her guidance, he became both a public solipsist and something of a radical - affirming the paramount value of being John before going on to adopt the campaigning postures of the 1970s: anti-war, anti-consumerism, anti-Nixon, anti-clericalism, a brief bout of workerism, 'power to the people' and so on. It was rickety stuff, but for most of the time he meant it, and within a few years of his liaison with Yoko, he had graduated from the knowing boy of the 1960s to the naive man-child we associate with his last years. 'Imagine' - his transnational anthem of 1971 - is typical of the new universalist peering out through smoked-glass spectacles. Direct, fantastical, awash with grandeur and schmaltz, and apparently harmless, it might nowadays have been commissioned for a Vodafone ad. Even so, it must have had an edge to it when Lennon performed it at a benefit for the relatives of inmates killed by police after the Attica State Prison riot in 1971 and it was BBC policy, nearly twenty years later, to keep it off the air for the duration of the Gulf War. For the rest, the John Lennon story is a tortuous family affair, in many intersecting senses of the term, and it's remained so, largely because the heyday of his avatar, John Beatle, and of his three siblings, must for commercial reasons be extended for as long as possible. But early on, everyone sensed that there was something distinctive about Lennon. In my family and others I knew, the Beatles met with condescending parental approval, and so it was natural to view them with suspicion. In 1966, when the press got hold of Lennon's 'bigger than Jesus' remark, he became a villain, at least where I grew up - one of a mixed bunch of Labour ministers, student revolutionaries and TV personalities (including, for some reason, the variety pianists Russ Conway and Mrs Mills). In the Home Counties, the maxim 'Know your enemy' was applied with latitude and as Lennon entered the pantheon of hate figures - a medium to al dente subversive whose name was reviled at gymkhanas and golf tournaments around the county - he rose in our esteem. I find it odd, but not surprising, that he's once again a family man - in my family at any rate. In the last two years I've reinvested in the productions of Mopheads Inc at the request of two boys under the age of six for whom the death of the person who didn't 'believe in Beatles' is so significant that it determines most of what they know or think about music. (For example: 'Who is this music by?' 'Johann Sebastian Bach.' 'Is he dead?' 'Yes.' 'Was he shot?') Striking, too, that in the run-and-run saga of the Beatles, we can't get away from the band and they can't get away from each other. It's as though they'd been condemned to an eternity of group therapy without a counsellor, a slanging match between the living and the dead, while younger admirers, plunderers and acolytes-at-one-remove, like Blur and the Gallaghers, pin messages of sympathy to the door of the consulting room. And then, quite easily, that little room begins to expand in a dream-like distortion until it's a vast concourse that appears to contain us all. Here, every thought or memory, however private, comes complete with a transfiguring riff by Lennon and McCartney. The stores are decorated with Pepperland hangings, the sun shines like a cartoon sun, the coffee machines play 'Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da' and mobile phones ring with a digitised version of 'Penny Lane'. Another family affair, on a much larger scale. 'Very strange.' Not so strange, perhaps, is Lennon's wish, from the late 1960s, to have done with this ever-extending artificial family. Neither is the fact that he failed to do so. On the face of it, the relationship with Yoko Ono was a more intimate venture, but it was also extraordinarily stagey and public. And 'the public' - that's us - was part of the baggage Lennon carried with him. We went as an enormous cast of pseudo-cousins, adopted brothers and sisters. We didn't have to concur with his snide (and amusing) remarks about the other Beatles: it was more a case of taking an interest in a new branch of the family, a divagation of an extreme kind that was sometimes hard to put up with. There were memorable lows - among them, 'Don't Worry Kyoko' and 'John, John', Yoko's contributions to the Plastic Ono Band's Live Peace in Toronto 1969 - but you could always spin back to Rubber Soul or Revolver for a big family get-together, repatriating Lennon to the land from which he'd done a very noisy runner. 'That... album with the drawing by Klaus Voorman on it,' he asks Jann Wenner apropos Revolver. 'Was that before Rubber Soul or after?' Nowadays, too, the happy family solution's at hand, with both those albums somewhere in the upper layer of chaos spread around the tape deck of the car. But as younger consumers in the Beatles Emporium come 'onstream', lapping up the recordings of the mid-1960s and imagining that Bach was wasted on the way to choir practice, one longs for a break in the story and a breather from the Beatlish-Lennonish mixture of knowing chic and know-nothing bonhomie which little boys seem to find as seductive as their mothers and fathers did. But perhaps not their grandparents, in whose eyes Lennon had blown it by becoming the person he is in this interview: self-engrossed, witty, malicious, foolish - someone who is always ready to be disabused and reabused, obstinately drawn to contending kinds of ruin, aloft between frying pan and fire and flipping like a dervish pancake, yet equally convinced of a redemptive universe which has delivered him safe and sound into the arms of Yoko Ono ('nothing works better than to have somebody you love hold you'). A confused figure waging several wars at once and taking no prisoners. An attractive figure, I find, and a model of frankness. This is a person gloriously incapable of circumspection. Even so, he has a project, which comes into focus early on in the interview: the articulation of a revitalised John Lennon, a chip off the old block certainly, but a New Man, too, replenished with the old values of rock and roll; a pain-artist with a Promethean gift to offer (rock and roll again, in its raw form, without the dinky, mediating talents of the Beatles) and a Promethean sacrifice to make: this welcome ordeal is forecast in 'Yer Blues' on the 'White Album' (1968), where the liver's left alone, but the eagle goes straight for the eyes - vision itself, a Lennonologist would tell you. This notion of the rock and roll performer going back to what he knows best is opposed to what the made-over Lennon describes as 'that sort of dead Beatles sound or dead recording sound', a multitude of tracks laid down under the supervision of George Martin and Paul McCartney. And not long after the old production values have come under fire, so has the material itself. Again, the issue is mediation, a lack of feeling or veracity in the fanciful little narratives - 'Eleanor Rigby' comes to mind - that stormed up the charts but had nothing to do with the business of speaking one's mind and singing one's soul. From this morass of trivia, apparently, the new, discerning Lennon rescues his best songs, his 'me' songs: 'In My Life', 'I'm a Loser', 'Help!', 'Strawberry Fields' ('all personal records'). 'They were the ones that I really wrote from experience and not projecting myself into a situation and writing a nice story about it, which I always found phony' - 'third-person songs about people who lived in concrete flats and things'. The emphasis now is on a music that comes from the inside, no virtuosity, none of the courtesies of 'projection', no more correlative niceties. Instead, a 'first-person music', bubbling forth from the self in anguish, revealed at last, like a run of leaking pipes with the lagging triumphantly torn away. It's stretching it a bit to describe 'In My Life' or 'Strawberry Fields' as rock and roll, but perhaps it's a manner of speaking as well as an expression of narrow allegiance. What matters is how to be John Lennon with a minimum of interference and rock and roll does a lot of work on this front. It also puts everyone in their place. 'What do your personal tastes run to?' 'Wop bop a loo bop. You know?... I don't like much else.' 'Why rock and roll?' 'That's the music that inspired me to play... There's nothing conceptually better than rock and roll. No group, be it Beatles, Dylan or Stones, has ever improved on 'Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' on' for my money.' Rock and roll sorts you out, then; like a therapy, it helps to distinguish the real you from the specious ones. And, of course, it's by means of this distinction that you're able to identify the good songs you wrote and the not-so-good songs, which is how you elect a song like 'Strawberry Fields' to the canon. It is by you and about you and about what you felt. What it has in common with 'Money' or 'Dizzy Miss Lizzy' (there are good renditions of both these standards on Live Peace in Toronto) is lack of adornment, and the quality of something properly authentic, an encounter in which the material has come readily to the composer, presenting itself in the form of an abundant natural resource: the opposite of the synthetic rummage-and-collage process that begins in 1967 with 'A Day in the Life' on Sgt Pepper and goes on through the 'White Album' to Abbey Road (1969). 'Real', 'true' and 'simple' are Lennon's catch-all descriptions of what he's after. On rock and roll again: 'You recognise something in it that is true, like all true art. Whatever art is, readers. Okay? It's that. If it's real, it's simple usually. And if it's simple, it's true. Something like that.' These remarks are by way of priming - maybe bracing - both himself and his fans for the forthcoming album. And in December 1970, with the record finished but not yet released, it's as though everything will stand or fall on this piece of work. The ground needs preparing for its reception -'people have to be hyped in a way, they've got to have it presented to them in all the best ways possible' - and a certain amount needs to be said about the real and the unreal, about the unpacking of the self and the recovery of the authentic John Lennon. Fans must also be readied for the album's hair-raising combination of fury and defencelessness - and for my money (as Lennon liked to say), 'Look at Me' is as good as any other song he elects to the party of simplicity, reality and truth. Much of the interview, then, is about the distresses and rewards of his self-revelation, under the tutelage of Yoko Ono and - from April 1970, when he embarked on primal therapy - Arthur Janov, author of The Primal Scream. These are the new and more helpful Maharishis chaperoning John towards his irreducible core of Lennonness. The old mentor is reviled. So is the stab at self-abandon, in the form of meditation, a natural place to have gone with LSD, hard on the heels of Brian Epstein's death in 1967 ('I thought: \"We've fuckin' had it\"'), but it didn't work out. It was a fraud masterminded by an earthly purveyor of cosmic wisdom who splashed his transcendental pheromones around the ashram, or whatever it was, every time he set eyes on Mia Farrow or her sister Prudence, all the while raking it in, courtesy of John, the three siblings and their girls. On the double album, the Maharishi becomes 'Sexy Sadie' - 'You made a fool of everyone' - and here, in one of several parting shots, Lennon describes how the news of Epstein's death reached the Beatles as they were set to attend a lecture by the Maharishi in Bangor. It was probably the moment that propelled Lennon to India, and it's revisited in that faintly hysterical, yet deeply economical style that reduces the world to a three-way contest between pain, intelligence and cant. The press said: '\"Brian's dead.\" I was stunned. We all were. And the Maharishi - we went into him, \"He's dead,\" and all that. And he was sort of saying: \"Oh, forget it, be happy.\" Fucking idiot.' Arthur Janov was a huge improvement. Sadie had shed no light, after all, on Lennon's feelings for his first family, the real disaster waiting to happen on the steps of Mount Pleasant Register Office, Liverpool, in December 1938, two years before he was born. The album proved that Janov could help him feel his way around the business of Freddy, the absconded father ('I wanted you but you didn't want me'), and Julia, the dead mother ('you had me but I never had you'). Janov also seems to have come up with a cure for the cure (screaming as the remedy for meditation), which must have posed a serious challenge. The most pressing issue was surely that Lennon had been boxed into a world of fantastic disproportion. With millions of people doting on your songs - the ones you like and the others you don't - you could be forgiven for thinking your difficulties were more than merely personal. Inasmuch as the real you was being consumed, understood or misunderstood across about a quarter of the earth's non-marine surface (plus a few bobbing pirate radio stations), your problems could be said to have a global dimension. And with the teachings of the Maharishi kicking in, and then out, it would all have taken on another dimension still. You may not have remained at one with the universe, but somehow the erstwhile notion that you became it by being part of it, then all of it, and that it became you in microcosm, would have left you feeling that immense forces were in play when you tried to figure out who you were. Janov was more usefully parochial. The thing to do with the 'self' was to shuck it, like something on a seafood platter, get 'in touch' with the injured child and redeem that injury with a primal enactment of pain. Lennon took to Janov, and after the embarrassing remark, 'We primal almost daily,' he disposes of the therapy quite honourably, refusing to betray it or allow it to betray him. In explaining what it was and how it worked, he contrives to strip it of babble, i.e. to Lennonise it. 'Primal therapy allowed us to feel feelings continually, and those feelings usually make you cry. That's all.' Whatever the vices of simplicity, they're hard to finger here. Lennon had called John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band 'the first primal album', but screaming and wailing were already modes that he knew well before his sessions with Janov. For years, the fans had been screaming and wailing and fainting wherever the Beatles went, and like spent witchfinders huddling in their cowls, the band would beat a retreat from this Devils of Loudun sound-effect to their blowsy cars and hotel suites. (I saw them at the Hammersmith Odeon around the time they released Beatles for Sale - 1964, I suppose. The screaming was so wild that my 12-year-old soulmate removed his shoe and threatened the girls in front, but they were intent on burning at the stake.) Screaming, too, was part of the band's act. 'Pain and screaming was before Janov,' Lennon says. 'Listen to \"Twist and Shout\"' - an Isley Brothers cover - 'I couldn't sing the damn thing. I was just screaming. Listen to\"a wop bop a loo bop a wop bam boom\"' - a Little Richard vocal line (garbled) from 'Tutti Frutti'. 'Don't get the therapy confused with the music.' And what's true (and 'simple' and 'real') of the voice is also true of the instrument: 'How do you rate yourself as a guitarist?' 'Well, it depends what kind of guitarist... ' 'Rock and roll.' 'I'm okay. I'm not technically very good, but I can make it fucking howl and move.' Janov, then, is a way station - a 'mirror', as the unexpurgated Yoko now interjects - like all Lennon's 'phases'. Matters are reassessed; there's a pause from the general exhaustion, perhaps the first real pause since Hamburg, and a retrospective.

Launchit2001, a competition announced today by Cross Atlantic Capital Partners (XACP), a venture capital management firm, and Brainspark, an internet and technology incubator, and supported by The Guardian, hopes to unlock the innovation hidden in university campuses and find Britain's next big name in the IT and telecoms industries. The competition is open to any individual in higher education or teams that include a student or academic staff member. XACP and Brainspark will select the best new business ventures submitted from universities, engineering and business schools in Britain. The best two or more winning ventures will be eligible for direct investment from XACP and Brainspark from a fund of \u00a31m in total, ranging from \u00a3100,000 to \u00a3500,000 packages. XACP and Brainspark are seeking entries for concepts that are beyond the initial research phase. Ideally, entries will have products and services that are ready to be commercialised or ideas that have passed a successful proof of concept. Entries will address one of four key areas within the IT and telecoms sectors: new enabling technologies (including nanotechnology and optoelectronics), internet infrastructure, enterprise software, e-communications and wireless infrastructure and applications. Launch2001 is supported by The Guardian, whose Online section has taken a special interest in technology and has reported extensively on the venture capital industry and the challenges associated with raising money.

You can ask <a href=\"http://www.kenjin.com\">Kenjin</a> to keep an eye on whatever you're typing or reading. It can then suggest related resources and present them to you as links. These can be web pages as well as documents and emails on your hard drive and the email addresses of other people in the Kenjin community whose interests are similar to yours. So if you are emailing a friend about a holiday in Mexico, it will automatically bring up links to maps, tourist information, flights and accommodation and your emails on the subject, all displayed at the bottom of your screen. </p> <p><strong> Why don't personal agents do all this for us? </strong> They can, but only if the technology behind them is intelligent. Most personal agents are keyword-based. This is useless for anyone who uses puns, jargon, slang or archaic expressions.

      "bodyText": "What does Kenjin offer that conventional search engines don't? Kenjin is an extremely effective way of showing users how information can be brought to them, as opposed to their having to seek it out. You can ask Kenjin to keep an eye on whatever you're typing or reading. It can then suggest related resources and present them to you as links. These can be web pages as well as documents and emails on your hard drive and the email addresses of other people in the Kenjin community whose interests are similar to yours. So if you are emailing a friend about a holiday in Mexico, it will automatically bring up links to maps, tourist information, flights and accommodation and your emails on the subject, all displayed at the bottom of your screen. Why don't personal agents do all this for us? They can, but only if the technology behind them is intelligent. Most personal agents are keyword-based. This is useless for anyone who uses puns, jargon, slang or archaic expressions. The keyword agent simply would not understand, for example, that 'Michael Heseltine', 'Hezza' and 'Tarzan' are all part of the same concept.

Police also searched another address this morning but made no further arrests.</p> <p>The arrest is the latest development in the investigation into the murder of Nigerian-born Damilola, who bled to death in a stairwell on a run-down estate in Peckham, south London after being stabbed in the leg as he walked home from an after-school computer class.</p> <p>He dragged himself 100 yards along the street before collapsing.</p> <p>Last Thursday, 11 boys aged between 12 and 16 were arrested in London in a series of dawn raids involving about 200 officers.</p> <p>Six of them were released on bail pending further inquiries. Another, aged 14, was released with no further action to be taken. A 39-year-old woman was also arrested and questioned over Damilola's death.</p> <p>The spotlight fell on this already high-profile case again today when it emerged that a police officer whose job as schools liaison officer in the area of south London where Damilola lived was about to be axed shortly before the murder.</p> <p>PC Ian Wright worked to improve relations between police and youngsters on the Peckham and Camberwell beat, and headteachers were furious when the Metropolitan Police announced last month that his post would be withdrawn.</p> <p>Scotland Yard said PC Wright had instead been \"seconded\" to a team designed to tackle violent crime among young people.</p> <p>Today the Police Federation said they were concerned that important work to build trust between officers and local youngsters will seriously damaged by PC Wright's move.</p> <p>Among the schools on the constable's patch was the Oliver Goldsmith primary school in Peckham, which was attended by Damilola before his fatal stabbing.</p> <p>The chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, Glen Smyth, said: \"PC Wright built up such a good relationship with the children that when they were told he was being withdrawn, the headteachers of the schools wrote independently of each other saying they were desperate to keep him.</p> <p>\"If these tragic events hadn't taken place he would have gone. Even with his new role we are very concerned about the impact it will have on relations with young people in the area.\"</p> <p>PC Wright, who is qualified as a teacher, concentrated on primary schools in the area, added Mr Smyth. \"It is important to catch them early because by the time they go to secondary schools you have lost them.</p> <p>\"This area has a large refugee population and some of them may come from countries where policing is done down the barrel of a gun. It's vital to build trust for the police in those circumstances, because these children could become the gang members of the future,\" said Mr Smyth.</p> <p>The move of an officer from a community role was typical of the shortages being suffered by the Met, which is 3,250 officers below strength, he added.</p> <p>A Met spokesman said: \"As part of our creation of a team to help tackle youth crime on the estate it was important to ensure that this team was linked closely with schools that had a catchment area that included the North Peckham Estate.</p> <p>\"Because of Ian's local knowledge and expertise he has been seconded into this team for three months.

      "bodyText": "A 15-year-old boy was arrested in a dawn raid today by police investigating the murder of 10-year-old Damilola Taylor, the 13th person to be picked up in connection to the November 27 stabbing. The youth was arrested at an address in Camberwell and was being questioned at a London police station, said a Scotland Yard spokeswoman. The 15-year-old, who is black, had not been arrested before, the spokeswoman said. Police also searched another address this morning but made no further arrests. The arrest is the latest development in the investigation into the murder of Nigerian-born Damilola, who bled to death in a stairwell on a run-down estate in Peckham, south London after being stabbed in the leg as he walked home from an after-school computer class. He dragged himself 100 yards along the street before collapsing. Last Thursday, 11 boys aged between 12 and 16 were arrested in London in a series of dawn raids involving about 200 officers. Six of them were released on bail pending further inquiries. Another, aged 14, was released with no further action to be taken. A 39-year-old woman was also arrested and questioned over Damilola's death. The spotlight fell on this already high-profile case again today when it emerged that a police officer whose job as schools liaison officer in the area of south London where Damilola lived was about to be axed shortly before the murder. PC Ian Wright worked to improve relations between police and youngsters on the Peckham and Camberwell beat, and headteachers were furious when the Metropolitan Police announced last month that his post would be withdrawn. Scotland Yard said PC Wright had instead been \"seconded\" to a team designed to tackle violent crime among young people. Today the Police Federation said they were concerned that important work to build trust between officers and local youngsters will seriously damaged by PC Wright's move. Among the schools on the constable's patch was the Oliver Goldsmith primary school in Peckham, which was attended by Damilola before his fatal stabbing. The chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, Glen Smyth, said: \"PC Wright built up such a good relationship with the children that when they were told he was being withdrawn, the headteachers of the schools wrote independently of each other saying they were desperate to keep him. \"If these tragic events hadn't taken place he would have gone. Even with his new role we are very concerned about the impact it will have on relations with young people in the area.\" PC Wright, who is qualified as a teacher, concentrated on primary schools in the area, added Mr Smyth. \"It is important to catch them early because by the time they go to secondary schools you have lost them. \"This area has a large refugee population and some of them may come from countries where policing is done down the barrel of a gun. It's vital to build trust for the police in those circumstances, because these children could become the gang members of the future,\" said Mr Smyth. The move of an officer from a community role was typical of the shortages being suffered by the Met, which is 3,250 officers below strength, he added. A Met spokesman said: \"As part of our creation of a team to help tackle youth crime on the estate it was important to ensure that this team was linked closely with schools that had a catchment area that included the North Peckham Estate. \"Because of Ian's local knowledge and expertise he has been seconded into this team for three months. This team reports directly to the inspector for the Peckham and Camberwell sector and so, although he has changed his role, he will still be working in the same area with the same schools, but with a particular focus on violent crime and young people.\" The Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, Simon Hughes, said two schools in his Southwark North and Bermondsey constituency covered by PC Wright had protested at his withdrawal. He said: \"The police are under such pressure that these sorts of jobs are jobs they have to consider losing in order to do a simple response job. This is exactly the sort of job we need people to do - police officers in schools, police officers becoming role models for youngsters are crucially important. The reality is that they are desperately short of police.\" A Met spokesman said that PC Wright's job had been re-advertised, although he was free to re-apply for the post, which he has held for 10 years. \"The decision to re-advertise his post was taken two weeks before Damilola's murder,\" the spokesman said. The time taken to fill the vacancy would depend on \"the quality of the candidates\" but it would, he hoped, be fairly quick.

      "body": "<p>\u0095 Ang Lee's martial art-house movie <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Title?0190332\">Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</a>(pictured) was last night named as the best film of 2000 by the Toronto Film Critics Association. The Canadian award further muddies the waters in the run up to Oscar night, arriving hot on the heels of rival award triumphs by Steven Soderbergh's <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Title?0181865\">Traffic</a> (from the New York critics), the coming-of-age rock movie <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Title?0181875\">Almost Famous</a> (the Boston critics) and Ridley Scott's <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Title?0172495\">Gladiator</a> (the Broadcast awards). With no apparent consensus on the year's most significant movie, expect the 2001 Academy Awards to throw up a few surprises. </p> <p>\u0095 As he waits to see whether his film will connect with the Academy voters, Crouching Tiger director <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Name?Lee,+Ang\">Ang Lee</a> is mulling over his next move. Having dabbled in British high society with Sense and Sensibility, Nixon-era angst in The Ice Storm and American Civil War strife in Ride With the Devil, Lee appears likely to try his hand at a big-style Hollywood musical next. In an interview with Wednesday's Washington Post, the director confessed that he wants to: \"Work in the [Hollywood] system, see how it takes. I'm curious. I might do a singing movie in New York. But I have to use the genre to tell a personal story. That's important for me. I hope my career can be like a long film school.\"</p> <p>\u0095 Having researched the Cuban missile crisis in preparation for his role in the thriller, Thirteen Days, <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Name?Costner,+Kevin\">Kevin Costner</a> identified one of the crisis's unsung heroes - and sent the man a cheque. According to Costner, the true hero of the day was a lowly Russian soldier who turned the world back from the brink of nuclear catastrophe. These days the retired soldier survives on a scant state pension. \"He lives off of $50 a month, so I'm sending him $500,\" said the millionaire actor. \"That should last him a few years by that standard.\" $500 for saving the planet? Sounds like Costner has got himself a bargain. </p> <p>\u0095 The final pieces of the <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Title?0145487\">Spider-Man</a> jigsaw have been filled with the casting of a trio of supporting actors, Cliff Robertson, Rosemary Harris and JK Simmons. Robertson and Harris will appear as Uncle Ben and Aunt May, the gentle guardians of the youthful Peter Parker (who, unbeknown to them, is also Spider-Man). Simmons takes on a more meaty role as the cigar-chomping J Jonah Jameson, irascible editor of the New York newspaper where Parker works. They join Tobey Maguire (as Spiderman), Kirsten Dunst (as love-interest Mary Jane Watson) and Willem Dafoe (as the Green Goblin). The film begins shooting next month. </p> <p>\u0095 <a href=\"/Film/Player/Player_Page/0,4159,81094,00.html\">Catherine Zeta-Jones</a> is to be honoured by her home town when she becomes the first person ever to receive the freedom of Mumbles, a village near Swansea. John Pickard, clerk of Mumbles Community Council, told the Sun newspaper that, \"Before her wedding to Michael Douglas not many people had heard of Mumbles.

      "bodyText": "\u0095 Ang Lee's martial art-house movie Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon(pictured) was last night named as the best film of 2000 by the Toronto Film Critics Association. The Canadian award further muddies the waters in the run up to Oscar night, arriving hot on the heels of rival award triumphs by Steven Soderbergh's Traffic (from the New York critics), the coming-of-age rock movie Almost Famous (the Boston critics) and Ridley Scott's Gladiator (the Broadcast awards). With no apparent consensus on the year's most significant movie, expect the 2001 Academy Awards to throw up a few surprises. \u0095 As he waits to see whether his film will connect with the Academy voters, Crouching Tiger director Ang Lee is mulling over his next move. Having dabbled in British high society with Sense and Sensibility, Nixon-era angst in The Ice Storm and American Civil War strife in Ride With the Devil, Lee appears likely to try his hand at a big-style Hollywood musical next. In an interview with Wednesday's Washington Post, the director confessed that he wants to: \"Work in the [Hollywood] system, see how it takes. I'm curious. I might do a singing movie in New York. But I have to use the genre to tell a personal story. That's important for me. I hope my career can be like a long film school.\" \u0095 Having researched the Cuban missile crisis in preparation for his role in the thriller, Thirteen Days, Kevin Costner identified one of the crisis's unsung heroes - and sent the man a cheque. According to Costner, the true hero of the day was a lowly Russian soldier who turned the world back from the brink of nuclear catastrophe. These days the retired soldier survives on a scant state pension. \"He lives off of $50 a month, so I'm sending him $500,\" said the millionaire actor. \"That should last him a few years by that standard.\" $500 for saving the planet? Sounds like Costner has got himself a bargain. \u0095 The final pieces of the Spider-Man jigsaw have been filled with the casting of a trio of supporting actors, Cliff Robertson, Rosemary Harris and JK Simmons. Robertson and Harris will appear as Uncle Ben and Aunt May, the gentle guardians of the youthful Peter Parker (who, unbeknown to them, is also Spider-Man). Simmons takes on a more meaty role as the cigar-chomping J Jonah Jameson, irascible editor of the New York newspaper where Parker works. They join Tobey Maguire (as Spiderman), Kirsten Dunst (as love-interest Mary Jane Watson) and Willem Dafoe (as the Green Goblin). The film begins shooting next month. \u0095 Catherine Zeta-Jones is to be honoured by her home town when she becomes the first person ever to receive the freedom of Mumbles, a village near Swansea. John Pickard, clerk of Mumbles Community Council, told the Sun newspaper that, \"Before her wedding to Michael Douglas not many people had heard of Mumbles. But that's history now.\" Thanks to Zeta-Jones' marriage, the world now rings with Mumbles.",

Geoffrey Clifton-Brown solemnly warned: \"There is a danger animals might be arrested.\" Tony Banks said pro-hunters were \"the political descendants of slavers and people who sent little boys up chimneys\".</p> <p>\"Grow up!\" shouted furious Tories. \"It's about human pleasure, it's about the chase, the bloodlust and the kill!\" he yelled, and I swear I heard a rousing cry of \"Bollocks!\"</p> <p>Then Michael Heseltine produced a fabulous rant, 10 minutes of the noise you hear at a speedway without the relief of the Doppler effect. When Mr Banks went fishing, he asked, \"does he pat the fish on the head, throw it back, and say 'Do your best to survive, after I have taken the guts out of you'?\" Was this really the most important issue facing the nation? Of course not! The bill existed purely in the narrow class interests of the Labour party.</p> <p>At this, Labour's Ronnie Campbell was reproved for saying something roughly similar to \"bollocks\", but nothing would slow Hezza down. \"His backside is pretty eloquent!\" he raved.</p> <p>And this is not the real debate on the three options: that's next year. I may need to flee the country, possibly to comfort Sir Richard Branson on his tropical paradise.</p>",

David Lidington, the Tory spokesman (his boss, Ann Widdecombe, is ferociously anti-hunting) was opposed to \"lamping\", which means blinding foxes with lights, then shooting them with high-powered rifles. It could be dangerous to humans, he said, and he's right: for centuries amorous swains and sportive maids have regarded the countryside at night as one huge knocking shop. Mike Foster, the MP who first moved a ban three years ago, was pinned down on his own sport, fishing. Wasn't that cruel to the fish? \"I do not go fishing with a pack of dogs,\" he said. Eh? Was anyone on either side going to deploy any logic here? John Major, who knows a bit about being hunted to destruction, defended it for animals. \"All violent death is distasteful, unless the fox dies in comfort, surrounded by his friends, and mourned by the neighbouring chickens.\" Mr Major uses sarcasm like a pugil stick on Gladiators, designed to unbalance rather than to wound. Then the debate began to become truly bonkers, the landscape strewn with bollocks. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown solemnly warned: \"There is a danger animals might be arrested.\" Tony Banks said pro-hunters were \"the political descendants of slavers and people who sent little boys up chimneys\". \"Grow up!\" shouted furious Tories. \"It's about human pleasure, it's about the chase, the bloodlust and the kill!\" he yelled, and I swear I heard a rousing cry of \"Bollocks!\" Then Michael Heseltine produced a fabulous rant, 10 minutes of the noise you hear at a speedway without the relief of the Doppler effect. When Mr Banks went fishing, he asked, \"does he pat the fish on the head, throw it back, and say 'Do your best to survive, after I have taken the guts out of you'?\" Was this really the most important issue facing the nation? Of course not! The bill existed purely in the narrow class interests of the Labour party. At this, Labour's Ronnie Campbell was reproved for saying something roughly similar to \"bollocks\", but nothing would slow Hezza down. \"His backside is pretty eloquent!\" he raved. And this is not the real debate on the three options: that's next year. I may need to flee the country, possibly to comfort Sir Richard Branson on his tropical paradise.",

Not only were students borrowing more money than ever before from banks and credit card companies, the research showed, but prospective undergraduates were also being deterred from applying to university because of fears about being saddled with debt. Opposition MPs claimed the findings proved the government's higher education policies - including the controversial introduction of tuition fees - were in disarray, and criticised ministers for putting a \"positive spin\" on them. The research into student finances is carried out by the Department for Education every three years, and was commissioned this time from Claire Callender of South Bank University and NOP Research. The survey, based on personal interviews with 2,800 students on degree courses in the 1998-99 academic year, showed that student debts had trebled since 1995-96 when the last research took place. Nearly nine out of 10 students faced financial difficulties, while nearly two-thirds of respondents said a member of their peer group had opted not to go into higher education because of worries about debt. In the three years of the study, between 1996 and 1999, student expenditure rose above the rate of inflation, fuelled by a 66 % increase in money borrowed from banks and credit card companies, in addition to official student loans. The average student debt was \u00a32,473, compared with \u00a3777 three years earlier. The research covered the 1998-99 academic year, a transitional period involving the first students affected by the Labour government's introduction of tuition fees. Since 1995-96 younger students have experienced a drop of 30% in grant income and a fall of 17% in regular parental contributions. Students are also supplementing their income by taking on more paid work, and using up more of their savings to fund their university education. Owain James, president of the National Union of Students, warned: \"The DfEE's own survey is a damning indictment of the government's student funding system.\" He added: \"These figures show that student hardship is widespread.\" Higher education minister Tessa Blackstone said in a statement: \"The survey evidence confirms that the great majority of full time students are taking our new fairer income loans, which are interest free in real terms with repayment linked to income.\" Evan Harris, the Liberal Democrat higher education spokesman, said that the survey was a condemnation of the government's policy on students.

A veteran of 50 Hong Kong kung fu movies, he is widely credited with catapulting Jackie Chan to international superstardom with his first two films as director, Snake in the Eagle's Shadow (1978) and Drunken Master (1979). </p> <p>But it is his airborne stunt choreography, known as \"wirework\", that has brought Wo Ping world renown. Not only does he make you believe a man can fly; he makes you believe he can glide, soar, hover, swoop, and all the other tricks in which birds had previously cornered the market. When you consider that he did all this for Keanu \"I know kung fu\" Reeves in The Matrix - 55-year-old Yuen's first Hollywood movie - the awesome scale of his achievement becomes apparent. </p> <p>Yuen takes things a stage further in Ang Lee's remarkable fantasy epic, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, in which Chow Yun-Fat, Michelle Yeoh and newcomer Zhang Ziyi, as crusading 17th-century warriors, do battle across rooftops, over mountains and lakes and, in one remarkable sequence, while swaying in the tops of bamboo trees. </p> <p> <strong> How did you get started in the business?</strong> </p> <p> My family were all involved in Chinese opera, and my father, Simon Yuen HsaioTien, was a movie actor and stuntman. He was my trainer, my own master, if you like. I used to go to movie sets to watch him work and got involved in my own right as a stuntman and background fighter in old-style martial arts movies in the 1950s. In the early days, they always picked me to be the one to die first. I was very good at falling down dead. </p> <p> <strong> How did you get into wirework?</strong> </p> <p> The turnover in movies in Hong Kong is pretty fast, so you get to try out all kinds of different styles. I started off doing period movies, then cop movies with a kung fu flavour, then we went back to swashbuckling heroics, where you have a freer hand with the choreography; you can heighten the swordplay and make it more operatic. I am more into the softer styles, rather than the hard, fast cut-cut-cut of a lot of movies, so I use the wire to bring that out. </p> <p> <strong> How does it work?</strong> </p> <p> The actors have to wear a heavy canvas corset attached by metal cables to a wire, which hoists them 75ft in the air. These are worked by a team of \"puppeteers\", working in tandem with the opposing actor's team to avoid mid-air collisions. There is no computer trickery involved - the only \"special effect\" is when we remove the wire in post-production. </p> <p> <strong> Would you say that you are the best wireworker in the world?</strong> </p> <p> That's not for me to say. I've done around 50 movies now, but it would be wrong ethically for anyone in our field to compare themselves. We admire each other's work. There's no jealousy: if someone comes up with a great new movie, it inspires the rest of us to do better next time. </p> <p> <strong> But you did 'make' Jackie Chan?</strong> </p> <p> The movies I did with Jackie put him on the map, but that was mainly because we changed the genre a little by taking some of the grimness out that had been there since Bruce Lee. We made it more slapstick, more fun. </p> <p> <strong> How does training Hollywood actors compare with working with Hong Kong actors?</strong> </p> <p> American actors aren't brought up in the Hong Kong tradition: Jackie Chan or Jet Li will already know how to fight, whereas those in Hollywood have to be trained. For instance, it took four months to teach Keanu Reeves the techniques. </p> <p> <strong> Kung fu has gone mainstream in Hollywood with movies such as Charlie's Angels. How do you account for its popularity?</strong> </p> <p> I don't really understand why this has happened. I think it must be that audiences in the US don't see too many Hong Kong movies, and they're not familiar with this kind of movement. And when they do see it, they love it, and they want more of it. </p> <p> <strong> Purists argue that the art of kung fu is being devalued because the likes of Keanu and Drew Barrymore claim they 'know kung fu' after a few months of training. Do you think this is the case?</strong> </p> <p> I didn't work on Charlie's Angels, but I know that Drew trained for five months. But I wouldn't call it devaluation; it's just a different way of working. You tailor-make the movement to the physicality and flexibility of the actor or actress. You can't compare Drew or Keanu to, say, Jet Li, or Jackie. There's a huge difference there in terms of movement, and I think everyone realises that. </p> <p> <strong> Have CGI and new technology changed the way you work?</strong> </p> <p> The major difference is that they have extended the boundaries of what is possible. I can do movements now that couldn't be done before. There has also been a transformation from the short cut to the longer take, so you can see more of the movement in a single shot. In Crouching Tiger, when they start flying over the rooftops, you can watch their movements in single takes. The technique was probably tailor-made for this project. So maybe \"evolve\" is a better word. As for CGI, I never use it. </p> <p> <strong> Have you done things in Crouching Tiger you've never done before?</strong> </p> <p> The main difference was that I had a lot of time to prepare, which you don't normally get in Hong Kong, where everything is so rushed, so I was able to work with the difficulties of the movement on the wire, and work out how to extend the movements over the rooftops and in the bamboo forest. When I first started in films like Iron Monkey, I wanted the martial arts to be very down to earth. That's a more practical and realistic approach. </p> <p>But in Crouching Tiger, I was trying to express the more magical characteristics of old-fashioned wu xia [\"martial chivalry\", a genre akin to sword and sorcery]. I still tried to incorporate some realistic touches, though. You might notice that they fly through the air, but for every leap they make they come back down to earth at some point. I knew that working with Ang Lee would bring out some incredible chemistry. He has strong ideas and I'm a great admirer of that. </p> <p> <strong> How did you shoot the bamboo forest scene?</strong> </p> <p> It was probably the hardest scene I've ever done, mainly because it was location work instead of studio work, so you couldn't put the usual precautions in place. You have to work out where to peg the wires in, try and find a supportive enough spot for the crane ... it's precision working. I usually have a team of 15, but for that scene it went up to about 40. If I'd had more time I'd have made it better. </p> <p> <strong> How long would, say, the first swordfight scene take to shoot?</strong> </p> <p> Ang Lee would tell me his requirements and I'd choreograph the scene in the studio. From conception to training to shooting, the whole thing would probably take about a week. </p> <p> <strong> Are the actors ever spooked by the things they're asked to do?</strong> </p> <p> It is normal to be scared of heights, of course, but we have very specific safety demonstrations to try and make the actors feel comfortable; safety is our first priority. If I'm not 100% focused every second, someone could end up dead. I'll work on the movement until I'm satisfied, and only then will I get the actor or actress involved. Crouching Tiger was only Zhang Ziyi's second movie, I think, but she'd been training with a coach for some months. Michelle Yeoh was already experienced in all kinds of movement. The biggest surprise for me was Chow Yun-Fat. He'd maybe only done one or two action films before, and it was his first time with wirework, but I was amazed. His movement was great. Maybe he saw a lot of Hong Kong movies beforehand. </p> <p> <strong> Do you think you've advanced the art form in Crouching Tiger?</strong> </p> <p> Again, it's not for me to say. It's a kind of trial, this movie. It's very nuanced, so it looks very different, and I tried to improvise a lot more on the wire, so hopefully it looks more artistic. Whether it's a \"new way\" or not is probably up to the future to decide. Basically on every project I just do the best I can. The director and actors are the stars, not me. If the market likes what I do, the boss will be happy. But even if it doesn't do so well, I know I've worked to the best of my ability. </p> <p>\u0095 Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is released on January 5.</p>",

For instance, it took four months to teach Keanu Reeves the techniques. Kung fu has gone mainstream in Hollywood with movies such as Charlie's Angels. How do you account for its popularity? I don't really understand why this has happened. I think it must be that audiences in the US don't see too many Hong Kong movies, and they're not familiar with this kind of movement. And when they do see it, they love it, and they want more of it. Purists argue that the art of kung fu is being devalued because the likes of Keanu and Drew Barrymore claim they 'know kung fu' after a few months of training. Do you think this is the case? I didn't work on Charlie's Angels, but I know that Drew trained for five months. But I wouldn't call it devaluation; it's just a different way of working. You tailor-make the movement to the physicality and flexibility of the actor or actress. You can't compare Drew or Keanu to, say, Jet Li, or Jackie. There's a huge difference there in terms of movement, and I think everyone realises that. Have CGI and new technology changed the way you work? The major difference is that they have extended the boundaries of what is possible. I can do movements now that couldn't be done before. There has also been a transformation from the short cut to the longer take, so you can see more of the movement in a single shot. In Crouching Tiger, when they start flying over the rooftops, you can watch their movements in single takes. The technique was probably tailor-made for this project. So maybe \"evolve\" is a better word. As for CGI, I never use it. Have you done things in Crouching Tiger you've never done before? The main difference was that I had a lot of time to prepare, which you don't normally get in Hong Kong, where everything is so rushed, so I was able to work with the difficulties of the movement on the wire, and work out how to extend the movements over the rooftops and in the bamboo forest. When I first started in films like Iron Monkey, I wanted the martial arts to be very down to earth. That's a more practical and realistic approach. But in Crouching Tiger, I was trying to express the more magical characteristics of old-fashioned wu xia [\"martial chivalry\", a genre akin to sword and sorcery]. I still tried to incorporate some realistic touches, though. You might notice that they fly through the air, but for every leap they make they come back down to earth at some point. I knew that working with Ang Lee would bring out some incredible chemistry. He has strong ideas and I'm a great admirer of that. How did you shoot the bamboo forest scene? It was probably the hardest scene I've ever done, mainly because it was location work instead of studio work, so you couldn't put the usual precautions in place. You have to work out where to peg the wires in, try and find a supportive enough spot for the crane ... it's precision working. I usually have a team of 15, but for that scene it went up to about 40. If I'd had more time I'd have made it better. How long would, say, the first swordfight scene take to shoot? Ang Lee would tell me his requirements and I'd choreograph the scene in the studio. From conception to training to shooting, the whole thing would probably take about a week. Are the actors ever spooked by the things they're asked to do? It is normal to be scared of heights, of course, but we have very specific safety demonstrations to try and make the actors feel comfortable; safety is our first priority. If I'm not 100% focused every second, someone could end up dead. I'll work on the movement until I'm satisfied, and only then will I get the actor or actress involved. Crouching Tiger was only Zhang Ziyi's second movie, I think, but she'd been training with a coach for some months. Michelle Yeoh was already experienced in all kinds of movement. The biggest surprise for me was Chow Yun-Fat. He'd maybe only done one or two action films before, and it was his first time with wirework, but I was amazed. His movement was great. Maybe he saw a lot of Hong Kong movies beforehand. Do you think you've advanced the art form in Crouching Tiger? Again, it's not for me to say. It's a kind of trial, this movie. It's very nuanced, so it looks very different, and I tried to improvise a lot more on the wire, so hopefully it looks more artistic. Whether it's a \"new way\" or not is probably up to the future to decide. Basically on every project I just do the best I can. The director and actors are the stars, not me. If the market likes what I do, the boss will be happy. But even if it doesn't do so well, I know I've worked to the best of my ability. \u0095 Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is released on January 5.",

The pay-TV venture combines the UK's largest broadband company with a major Hollywood studio and its a back catalogue of blockbusters including The Mummy and Notting Hill. Following the thumbs-up from the European Commission, the channel will broadcast from next year. \"The commission's analysis showed that the creation of The Studio Channel will neither create nor reinforce a dominant position on any market,\" the commission said in a statement. Universal Studios is now part of the Vivendi Universal media conglomerate, which was formed by the \u00a350bn merger of French media company Vivendi and Seagram of Canada. When the deal was announced in September, it was expected to put a strain on relations between Vivendi boss Jean-Marie Messier and Rupert Murdoch, owner of NTL rival BSkyB.

      "bodyText": "The controversy over the Conservative treasurer, Lord Ashcroft, came back to haunt the party last night after leaked Foreign Office memos disclosed details of a blazing row with the British high commissioner in Belize. According to the memos, the billionaire peer told the commissioner, Tim David, during a Christmas drinks party that he was pompous, a liar and that he \"could fucking well get out now\". The row was so heated that the following day Lord Ashcroft sent a handwritten letter of apology and offered to make a donation to a charity of Mr David's choice. The party was held on December 9 in Belmopan, the capital of the former colony, and was hosted by the Belize Bank, in which Lord Ashcroft is a major shareholder. The diplomat described Lord Ashcroft's behaviour as shocking and deeply offensive. The 54-year-old peer is a close ally of the Conservative leader, William Hague, who has stuck by him despite a series of revelations that have damaged the party. Lord Ashcroft's links with the tiny Commonwealth country have been the source of embarrassment to the Conservative party, to which he has donated at least \u00a33m. The flare-up at the drinks party took place against the background of a British government investigation, being conducted by the accountants KPMG, into the secretive financial set-up in Belize, a tax haven where Lord Ashcroft has substantial holdings. A friend of Lord Ashcroft last night confirmed there had been a confrontation between the two men and described it as a sensitive issue. He said the latest disclosures were politically motivated and that the government was \"putting the bite on Michael [Ashcroft] to weaken him\" by trying to undermine his financial base. He insisted that the KPMG investigation had only been mentioned in passing during the row. Mr David, 43, who has been based in Belize for two years, having previously served in in Zimbabwe, Geneva, and Tanzania, told the Foreign Office that the Belize Bank had phoned him on December 8 to check he would be at its party the next day. Mr David said that after arriving at the party Lord Ashcroft had begun berating him over various issues, including attempts by the Labour party to block his elevation to the peerage. In the memo, which was intended to be seen by only a restricted number of people in the Foreign Office, Mr David said Lord Ashcroft had then raised the KPMG study. The British government is angry that KPMG's report, which is still at a draft stage, failed to look into the tax exemptions enjoyed by big multinationals operating in Belize. The government has suspended debt relief promised to Belize until it ends tax breaks for companies such as Lord Ashcroft's. Mr David said Lord Ashcroft had raised several points about the KPMG inquiry. He described the peer as having then gone nuclear, accusing the diplomat of having been nothing but trouble since being posted to Belize. Lord Ashcroft then advanced towards him and Mr David said he feared he was about to be hit. The diplomat told him he would finish his drink and leave in his own time. The following day, a Sunday, Lord Ashcroft faxed a letter, marked strictly private, to Mr David at the high commission. The peer said: \"To varying 'degrees' I don't suppose our diplomatic skills yesterday evening would have obtained a first. For my part, I sincerely apologise where such skills would not have made a third.\" He asked Mr David to contact Phil Johnson, who works at the Belize Bank, to nominate a charity to which he would make an appropriate donation. Mr David sought guidance from the Foreign Office on how he should reply, rejecting any suggestion that he himself had been undiplomatic and expressing no desire to apologise. Tim Roberts, director of corporate media relations for KPMG, refused to comment yesterday, referring the inquiry to the government: \"Our position on any report is we do it for a client and it is up to the client whether they want to comment on them.\" The chancellor, Gordon Brown, promised tax relief to Commonwealth countries but the government was uneasy about helping a country that had both ended VAT and was offering substantial tax exemptions. It is understood that KPMG has told government officials that it could not look into either the VAT question or the tax breaks because to do so would run foul of a treaty between Belize and Britain in 1982, the year after independence. This is the second time Lord Ashcroft has fallen foul of the British diplomatic service. In July last year a former high commissioner, David Mackilligin, wrote to the Times saying Conservatives should be questioning Lord Ashcroft's suitability for high office because of his involvement in Belize. He said the system of offshore trusts that Lord Ashcroft had established in Belize had left the country vulnerable to drug runners and others wanting to launder money. Lord Ashcroft helped to rescue a heavily indebted Tory party after the 1997 general election but ran into trouble when an honours scrutiny committee twice turned down a proposal that he become a peer. Having finally overcome this hurdle, he became a peer in October after promising to take up residency in Britain. He sued the Times last year over allegations about his business dealings in Belize but both sides later backed down. Questions have continued about whether someone who is the Conservative party's main benefactor should also be the party treasurer. Lord Ashcroft made his maiden speech in the Lords last week, condemning the \"cancer\" of drug trafficking in the Caribbean - an apparent rebuke to his critics. Such was his hold on Belize that he was until recently the country's ambassador to the UN. Giving up the post was part of the deal that allowed him to become a peer.",

The hospital is even considering sending some emergency cases to hotels and having a nurse on standby. </p> <p>A management memo circulated to consultants said: \"Clearly we would only be transferring patients to a hotel if it was safe to do so and with consultant agreement ... Are there are any emergency admissions which could use hotels at all? ... Any ideas?\" </p> <p>But consultants argued that hotels did not have the facilities to cope should anything go wrong. According to internal documents leaked to a local newspaper, one doctor said: \"I am not sure I would be happy for any of my patients to be in a hotel following surgery. If I was that happy, they could simply go home.\" </p> <p>Managers said the hotel plan would help them to treat patients who lived too far away to travel home after surgery. </p> <p>A spokeswoman said the hospital trust was looking at a number of schemes to help ease pressure over the winter. </p> <p>By accommodating locally those patients who lived some distance away \"we are able to provide more patients with routine day-case surgery\", she said. </p> <p>Consultants in the orthopaedic department have said it is at \"crisis point\", with concerns raised about hygiene. A leaked internal document said: \"The operating theatres are so poorly equipped that it was recommended that patients sign a consent form to say they know they are taking a risk over and above the normal.\" </p> <p>The trust said orthopaedic services were \"of excellent quality and perfectly safe\". Paul Roberts, chief executive, said: \"While we all agree the need for further investment, we have no doubt the managers and doctors will work together to keep services going and improving.\" </p> <p>Derriford hospital has been dogged by problems this year. The former chief executive and his deputy resigned after it emerged that waiting lists had been massaged to hit targets. </p> <p>One surgeon is taking the hospital to an employment tribunal claiming sexual discrimination and victimisation under the race relations act. </p> <p>Two other consultants settled out of court over claims that they had missed out on merit awards because of their race.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Consultants have expressed concern about a hospital's proposal to book patients into hotels to ease waiting lists. Managers at Derriford hospital in Plymouth would pay a minimum of \u00a365 a night for hotel beds rather than keep patients in hospital after their operations. The hospital is even considering sending some emergency cases to hotels and having a nurse on standby. A management memo circulated to consultants said: \"Clearly we would only be transferring patients to a hotel if it was safe to do so and with consultant agreement ... Are there are any emergency admissions which could use hotels at all? ... Any ideas?\" But consultants argued that hotels did not have the facilities to cope should anything go wrong. According to internal documents leaked to a local newspaper, one doctor said: \"I am not sure I would be happy for any of my patients to be in a hotel following surgery. If I was that happy, they could simply go home.\" Managers said the hotel plan would help them to treat patients who lived too far away to travel home after surgery. A spokeswoman said the hospital trust was looking at a number of schemes to help ease pressure over the winter. By accommodating locally those patients who lived some distance away \"we are able to provide more patients with routine day-case surgery\", she said. Consultants in the orthopaedic department have said it is at \"crisis point\", with concerns raised about hygiene. A leaked internal document said: \"The operating theatres are so poorly equipped that it was recommended that patients sign a consent form to say they know they are taking a risk over and above the normal.\" The trust said orthopaedic services were \"of excellent quality and perfectly safe\". Paul Roberts, chief executive, said: \"While we all agree the need for further investment, we have no doubt the managers and doctors will work together to keep services going and improving.\" Derriford hospital has been dogged by problems this year. The former chief executive and his deputy resigned after it emerged that waiting lists had been massaged to hit targets. One surgeon is taking the hospital to an employment tribunal claiming sexual discrimination and victimisation under the race relations act. Two other consultants settled out of court over claims that they had missed out on merit awards because of their race.",

The caller had argued that Mr Tyson, who has been imprisoned for rape, had served his punishment and should be allowed to box in the UK.

      "body": "<p><strong> Branded email </strong><br> Further to the article on branded email (Online, November 30) and letters in Feedback, how do I go about putting a logo and live hyperlink at the top of all my emails? Do I need to know HTML coding, or is there a Wizard of some form that will help me? I do not wish to force recipients to be online to see the logo: I want it sent with the email. <strong>David Fardon</strong> <br> <a href=\"mailto:DFardon@igroup.co.uk\">DFardon@igroup.co.uk</a> </p> <p><strong> Jack Schofield replies: </strong> Probably the simplest way is to create a letter with the embellishments you want and save it as stationery. In Outlook Express, do this using the File|Save as Stationery menu command. </p> <p>To create stationery, you must have elected to send HTML mail, which is email in web page format. To set this globally in Outlook Express, go to View|Options, choose the tab for Send, and click the radio button for HTML, which is under Mail Sending Format. However, you can also select this format for an individual email message by using its Format menu to select Rich Text (HTML). </p> <p>With HTML selected, you can use the Format|Apply Stationery menu item to load your own stationery, or one of the pre-written examples Microsoft supplies. </p> <p>With Microsoft Outlook - a different program from Outlook Express - go to Tools|Options, select the Mail Format tab, and set HTML mail. Then click the Stationery Picker button half way down the sheet, and click New to create your stationery. </p> <p>When creating stationery, you can import pictures and graphics such as company logos. It may be simplest to keep these in the stationery directory, which is usually </p> <p>C:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\Microsoft Shared\\ Stationery </p> <p>Any complete internet address (including the http://) that you type in will automatically be converted into a live link. </p> <p>Alternatively, you can create similar branded email in a word processor such as Microsoft Word, using your logo and live links, then send the resulting doc file as an attachment. In Word, go to Tools|Options, select the General tab, and click Email Options (in the bottom right-hand corner) for the Personal Stationery settings. </p> <p>However, it is not necessarily a good idea to use branded email. Images and stationery greatly increase the size of the email you send, and you should make sure your messages are as small as possible. Clueless and stupid PRs often send me messages with multicoloured logos that add up to half a megabyte, and this has a very negative impact on my opinion of their company's competence. </p> <p>HTML email is also inconvenient for people whose mail software does not recognise HTML formatting. It should never be used when posting to Usenet newsgroups, writing to mailing lists, or writing to Online. </p> <p><strong> Mail fails</strong><br> Two months ago we had the KAK virus on our home PC and installed Norton AntiVirus. Since then we have been unable to receive incoming mail via Outlook Express. Mailing out is no problem. Can you advise? <br><strong> Margaret Weaver </strong> <br> <a href=\"mailto:M.Weaver@derby.ac.uk\">M.Weaver@derby.ac.uk</a> </p> <p><strong> JS: </strong> Norton AntiVirus interposes itself between your email software and your mailbox so as to check email for viruses. If it does not install correctly, this can disable either incoming or outgoing mail, and this seems to be a fairly common problem. Go to <a href=\"http://www.symantec.com/techsupp/\">Symantec's online support service</a> and read a document called How to configure Outlook Express 5.0 with Norton AntiVirus 2000. (It is Document ID: 1999120717064306 but unfortunately Symantec's system cannot find a document from its official ID.) Alternatively, you may find <a href=\"http://www.io.com/~robertl/nav-help.html\">www.io.com/~robertl/nav-help.html</a> useful. </p> <p><strong> Back off</strong><br> In preparation for transferring material from my old computer, running Windows 95, to its replacement running Windows Me, I prepared a large number of backup discs using the MS Backup program in Windows 95. To my horror, Windows Me does not seem to support msbackup. How can I make use of the discs that I prepared? <br> <strong> P T Sherwood </strong> <br> <a href=\"mailto:psherwood@waitrose.com\">psherwood@waitrose.com</a> </p> <p><strong> JS: </strong> Don't. MS Backup is designed for backing up a particular PC: it is not intended or recommended for transferring files or moving programs between PCs. </p> <p>There are lots of different ways to move files between two machines. If they are side by side, the easiest is to use a cable to connect the two (preferably via their parallel printer ports) with Microsoft Direct Connection, which is part of Windows. A commercial alternative is <a href=\"http://www.laplink.com\">Laplink</a>, which is usually used with a Laplink serial cable. The latest version is called PCsync. </p> <p>Do not try to use DCC with a Laplink cable. </p> <p>An alternative is to transfer files using Iomega Zip disks that nominally hold 100MB or 250MB each or CD-R discs that hold more than 550MB.

      "bodyText": "Branded email Further to the article on branded email (Online, November 30) and letters in Feedback, how do I go about putting a logo and live hyperlink at the top of all my emails? Do I need to know HTML coding, or is there a Wizard of some form that will help me? I do not wish to force recipients to be online to see the logo: I want it sent with the email. David Fardon DFardon@igroup.co.uk Jack Schofield replies: Probably the simplest way is to create a letter with the embellishments you want and save it as stationery. In Outlook Express, do this using the File|Save as Stationery menu command. To create stationery, you must have elected to send HTML mail, which is email in web page format. To set this globally in Outlook Express, go to View|Options, choose the tab for Send, and click the radio button for HTML, which is under Mail Sending Format. However, you can also select this format for an individual email message by using its Format menu to select Rich Text (HTML). With HTML selected, you can use the Format|Apply Stationery menu item to load your own stationery, or one of the pre-written examples Microsoft supplies. With Microsoft Outlook - a different program from Outlook Express - go to Tools|Options, select the Mail Format tab, and set HTML mail. Then click the Stationery Picker button half way down the sheet, and click New to create your stationery. When creating stationery, you can import pictures and graphics such as company logos. It may be simplest to keep these in the stationery directory, which is usually C:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\Microsoft Shared\\ Stationery Any complete internet address (including the http://) that you type in will automatically be converted into a live link. Alternatively, you can create similar branded email in a word processor such as Microsoft Word, using your logo and live links, then send the resulting doc file as an attachment. In Word, go to Tools|Options, select the General tab, and click Email Options (in the bottom right-hand corner) for the Personal Stationery settings. However, it is not necessarily a good idea to use branded email. Images and stationery greatly increase the size of the email you send, and you should make sure your messages are as small as possible. Clueless and stupid PRs often send me messages with multicoloured logos that add up to half a megabyte, and this has a very negative impact on my opinion of their company's competence. HTML email is also inconvenient for people whose mail software does not recognise HTML formatting. It should never be used when posting to Usenet newsgroups, writing to mailing lists, or writing to Online. Mail fails Two months ago we had the KAK virus on our home PC and installed Norton AntiVirus. Since then we have been unable to receive incoming mail via Outlook Express. Mailing out is no problem. Can you advise? Margaret Weaver M.Weaver@derby.ac.uk JS: Norton AntiVirus interposes itself between your email software and your mailbox so as to check email for viruses. If it does not install correctly, this can disable either incoming or outgoing mail, and this seems to be a fairly common problem. Go to Symantec's online support service and read a document called How to configure Outlook Express 5.0 with Norton AntiVirus 2000. (It is Document ID: 1999120717064306 but unfortunately Symantec's system cannot find a document from its official ID.) Alternatively, you may find www.io.com/~robertl/nav-help.html useful. Back off In preparation for transferring material from my old computer, running Windows 95, to its replacement running Windows Me, I prepared a large number of backup discs using the MS Backup program in Windows 95. To my horror, Windows Me does not seem to support msbackup. How can I make use of the discs that I prepared? P T Sherwood psherwood@waitrose.com JS: Don't. MS Backup is designed for backing up a particular PC: it is not intended or recommended for transferring files or moving programs between PCs. There are lots of different ways to move files between two machines. If they are side by side, the easiest is to use a cable to connect the two (preferably via their parallel printer ports) with Microsoft Direct Connection, which is part of Windows. A commercial alternative is Laplink, which is usually used with a Laplink serial cable. The latest version is called PCsync. Do not try to use DCC with a Laplink cable. An alternative is to transfer files using Iomega Zip disks that nominally hold 100MB or 250MB each or CD-R discs that hold more than 550MB. A standalone Zip, CD-R or other high-capacity drive can be plugged into the old PC via its parallel printer port or, better, USB port for copying, then plugged into the new PC to upload the files. However, your old PC is unlikely to have a USB port and Windows 95 does not support USB. I use a MicroSolutions Backpack CD writer, which is excellent, but expensive unless you do this all the time. Word switch I have installed Microsoft Word 2000. Is there any way by which to transfer my files from MS Works to Word 2000? Sometimes Wordpad is transferred but not MS Works. Any ideas, please? Eric Powell e.e.powell@btinternet.com JS: Word comes with a file called Works432.cnv to load files created with Works for Windows 4.0. It should be in C:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\Microsoft Shared\\ TextConv but if not, install it from your Word CD. A converter for Works 3 files (Works332.cnv) is available in The Microsoft Office Converter Pack on the web at www.microsoft.com/office/ork/2000/appndx/toolbox.htm You may have to load earlier files into Works and re-save them in a format that is easier to transfer between programs and between PCs.

The reforms - billed as the biggest changes to adoption law in 25 years - will give parents more power to appeal against decisions which prevent them adopting because they are of a different race to the child. Local authorities that fail to meet stringent targets aimed at speeding up the adoption process could find themselves stripped of their powers to handle adoptions. The proposals, contained in a white paper on adoption, were widely welcomed by adoption experts and lobbyists. Felicity Collier, chief executive of the British Agencies for Adoption and Fostering, said: \"The emphasis on more support for adoptive families and their children and the promised allocation of funds will make a tremendous difference to society's most disadvantaged children.\" The white paper is designed to speed up the process and clear the backlog of more than 2,000 children waiting for a permanent home.

My own father was adopted and not brought up by his own parents.\" </p> <p>Mr Blair's father, Leo, was the illegitimate son of travelling entertainers Celia Ridgeway and Charles Parsons. </p> <p>The social stigma of having a child out of wedlock and their hectic lifestyles prompted Leo's parents to give him to poor Clydesdale ship worker James Blair and his wife, Mary, who they met on tour in Glasgow. </p> <p>Leo Blair went on to become a successful barrister, although his foster mother, Mary, prevented contact between him and his biological family. </p> <p>The prime minister's father was later reunited with his biological half-sister Pauline Harding. The prime minister, his wife and their three eldest children were present at the emotional family reunion. </p> <p>Mr Blair said the adoption system needed national co-ordination to reduce arbitrary regional differences, and a nationwide register to match children with suitable parents. </p> <p>He said: \"The whole purpose of this is to clear away the clutter of rules that stop children having a decent home. We have got to get some common sense back into the system. </p> <p>\"No matter how good a care home is, it isn't as good as having a loving family.\" </p> <p>Earlier, Mr and Mrs Blair sat down for an informal chat with a few of the 300 adoptive families and children placed through the Coram Family Centre. </p> <p>The families told the Blairs of their struggles with the bureaucracy of the adoption system, the stresses caused by the drawn out legal process, financial problems faced by adoptive families and the detrimental effects of the process on children. </p> <p>Amuda and Ian, who declined to give their surnames to protect their children, said they adopted Gareth, now nine, six years ago and called for more financial support for adoptive families. </p> <p>At the age of three Gareth had already been looked after by eight different families. </p> <p>The couple, both social workers, said it then took a further two-and-a-half years to battle through the legal system to adopt Gareth. </p> <p>Poor post-adoption care meant his behavioural problems were not diagnosed until he was eight. </p> <p>Amuda, 47, told the Blairs: \"Adoption is a very long road. It's that commitment beyond normal parenting. </p> <p>\"It will take Gareth a whole lifetime to overcome what he experienced in the first three years of his life.\" </p> <p>Another adoptive mother, Margaret, said her 17-year-old son, David, waited five years to be placed with a family. </p> <p>She said: \"People were doing their best but there was no feeling of hope.\" </p> <p>The Coram Family, England's oldest charity, is an adoption agency which specialises in helping children who have suffered abuse or neglect, and those who have disabilities or learning difficulties. </p>",

My own father was adopted and not brought up by his own parents.\" Mr Blair's father, Leo, was the illegitimate son of travelling entertainers Celia Ridgeway and Charles Parsons. The social stigma of having a child out of wedlock and their hectic lifestyles prompted Leo's parents to give him to poor Clydesdale ship worker James Blair and his wife, Mary, who they met on tour in Glasgow. Leo Blair went on to become a successful barrister, although his foster mother, Mary, prevented contact between him and his biological family. The prime minister's father was later reunited with his biological half-sister Pauline Harding. The prime minister, his wife and their three eldest children were present at the emotional family reunion. Mr Blair said the adoption system needed national co-ordination to reduce arbitrary regional differences, and a nationwide register to match children with suitable parents. He said: \"The whole purpose of this is to clear away the clutter of rules that stop children having a decent home. We have got to get some common sense back into the system. \"No matter how good a care home is, it isn't as good as having a loving family.\" Earlier, Mr and Mrs Blair sat down for an informal chat with a few of the 300 adoptive families and children placed through the Coram Family Centre. The families told the Blairs of their struggles with the bureaucracy of the adoption system, the stresses caused by the drawn out legal process, financial problems faced by adoptive families and the detrimental effects of the process on children. Amuda and Ian, who declined to give their surnames to protect their children, said they adopted Gareth, now nine, six years ago and called for more financial support for adoptive families. At the age of three Gareth had already been looked after by eight different families. The couple, both social workers, said it then took a further two-and-a-half years to battle through the legal system to adopt Gareth. Poor post-adoption care meant his behavioural problems were not diagnosed until he was eight. Amuda, 47, told the Blairs: \"Adoption is a very long road. It's that commitment beyond normal parenting. \"It will take Gareth a whole lifetime to overcome what he experienced in the first three years of his life.\" Another adoptive mother, Margaret, said her 17-year-old son, David, waited five years to be placed with a family. She said: \"People were doing their best but there was no feeling of hope.\" The Coram Family, England's oldest charity, is an adoption agency which specialises in helping children who have suffered abuse or neglect, and those who have disabilities or learning difficulties.",

      "body": "<p>There's a man in Downing Street, close to Tony Blair, who is rather keen on NMD, the national missile defence system which George W Bush has said he will deploy. He believes there will soon be so many loose missiles in rogue states that appropriate counter-missiles may be essential. His voice won't be decisive.</p> <p>Most official British opinion is strongly, if discreetly, opposed to NMD. But a straw flutters in the wind. An accommodation is possibly being prepared. What Bush proposes and Colin Powell disposes, Tony Blair may decide he cannot oppose. Not far over the horizon, the ground is opening up for the most awkward struggle in the modern history of Anglo-American relations.</p> <p>General Powell upped the ante on Monday, his first outing as Bush's secretary-of-state designate. The ambiguities of the Clinton attitude to NMD are already being dispelled. \"We're going to go forward,\" Powell firmly said. There would be tough negotiations with those countries that \"don't yet understand our thinking with respect to national missile defence\". The thinking is very committed. Bush made that clear several times in the election campaign. Powell, though once listed as a Pentagon man who feared NMD would take money away from more treasured military ventures, is now the voice of an opposite decision already made in principle.</p> <p>His statement coincided with another. A CIA study-project, making an assessment of the next 15 years, asserts that the threat to the mainland US from nuclear missiles, among other weapons, is greater than it was for most of the cold war. This will, the CIA thinks, get worse. Terrorists and rogue states will have the power and motivation to launch attacks that produce \"mass casualties\".</p> <p>This wasn't said to justify NMD. But it nourishes the mind-set that is demanding a new $60bn defence programme, irrespective of what might happen in the rogue states in question. Both North Korea and Iran arguably show reason for mild optimism. Iraq could soon be the solitary credible danger. No matter. No matter, either, that Russia, with whom the US has an anti-ballistic missile treaty, is fiercely opposed. Russia no longer matters, argues Richard Perle, a close Bush associate. The lead-time to build NMD is long, the world is usually changing for the worse, and the Washington voices prepared to speak up against unilateral defence may soon be hard to hear.</p> <p>At present, Downing Street professes to be quite comfortable. Blair got Clinton and Russian president Putin talking about NMD. He wants to be, as ever, the contact man, mediator, bridge. Since the election, his people have talked to Powell and, at greater length, to Condoleezza Rice, Bush's new national security adviser. The talks have apparently been more reassuring than Powell's public statement. Rice vowed to proceed with caution, sensitive to allied worries.</p> <p>Maybe she will. These advisers matter hugely. Bush's personal contribution to all complicated subjects will be far less creative than Clinton's. He will be heavily adviser-dependent. Rice says she is interested in sea-based defence missiles aimed to hit rogues at the point of launch, rather than the scheme Clinton half-backed which depended on the hit being made in space. The work required to switch schemes would be massive. But a boost-phase system would at least not depend on British and Danish tracking stations.</p> <p>As presently conceived, NMD proposes a new hi-tech skyscraper on Fylingdales moor, a project which, as British ministers have tried to explain in Washington, would be relentlessly picketed not only by CND and Greenpeace but by the north Yorkshire branch of the Women's Institute, furious at defilement of the countryside.</p> <p>Under Clinton, British and European objections to NMD fed into an administration inclined to take them seriously. They weren't limited to the region's interest in not being targeted, as helpless accomplices to American unilateralism, but put most weight on the global instability provoked by a new arms race. If NMD ever did happen, Russia and especially China would feel obliged to counter it. Whitehall, like Paris and Berlin, has made these arguments copiously. A quiet turmoil of alarm has gripped the Foreign Office and Ministry of Defence for months.</p> <p>They now face a Washington being peopled by voices that make a different analysis: scornful of Russia, arrogant about China, intolerant of European sensitivities, overwhelmingly impressed by the case for defending US territory - and confident that the practical failure of NMD so far, like the untested capacities of a boost-phase project, are mere blips on the relentless American path towards technological mastery.</p> <p>One answer being given to the choice between space- attack and launch-attack systems is that both should be pursued. Though it remains to be seen how Congress will react to the financial burden, missile defence is not guaranteed to be one of the aspects of the Bush programme that founders on a bitterly divided legislature. My conversations tell me that the commitment to build and deploy is likely to be made: much more likely, at any rate, than not.</p> <p>This will present Tony Blair with a challenge he has not so far faced. His time in office has been spent with a fellow spirit in the White House, someone to whom he grew close. We may be sure he will attempt to attain real intimacy with Bush, and he's likely to be more successful at it than John Major was with Clinton. Mr Blair makes a good fist of being friends with every species on the political spectrum, the only exception being a certain kind of Tory politician.</p> <p>He will strain every muscle to get on with Bush. And Bush, never having visited a major European country, will be more than usually susceptible to the charms of a land whose language he understands, whose history his father knows, and which matters more than Aznar's Spain, the only other contender.</p> <p>Blair, in other words, could become a safe haven for the Texas ingenu. His personal instincts will be to do whatever he can to help Bush; and now he has a voice or two whispering words of encouragement to persuade him that NMD may not, after all, be as dangerous as the defence and diplomatic establishment has been telling him. There are, after all, a lot of loose missiles about. Maybe NMD, if the Americans can produce one that works, is just what we need. Maybe the big picture says that it's the prime minister's duty to rise above conventional wisdom.</p> <p>If this became Blair's formal position, it would create his deepest rupture with continental Europe. A moment of truth almost certainly beckons. Will NMD become a pretext that requires one more affirmation of the old special relationship? Or the project that at last obliges Britain to recognise she cannot continue as the compliant poodle? Without doubt it will be the issue that shatters the Blair axiom that there's no choice to be made.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:hugoyoung@compuserve.com\">hugoyoung@compuserve.com</a></p>",

His remarks, at the outset of the reading of a government bill setting out three options for the future of hunting, will strengthen the hand of those who oppose a ban. It may also increase support for the licensing option in the Lords, where the ban proposal is expected to meet passionate opposition in the run-up to the general election. Last night MPs voted to give the bill a second reading by 373 votes to 158, a majority of 215. The size of the majority does not give a clear indication if there is support for Mr Straw's choice, but backers of an outright ban were pleased. Mr Straw insisted the expression of his personal views on the subject for the first time in 21 years was not designed to give a lead to other government members. But it may encourage other cabinet ministers, such as Robin Cook, to support licensing rather than an outright ban. He said his opinion had been informed by the official inquiry into the economic impact of a ban on fox hunting which was led by Lord Burns. Under the licensing scheme, only hunts which have been granted permission from a statutory hunting authority would be allowed to ride. Downing Street indicated that Mr Blair would vote for a full ban when MPs come to vote for one of the three options early in January. Mr Blair's advisers believe a confrontation with the hunting lobby in the run-up to a general election could enthuse voters in the 20- to 30-year-old age group, who are believed to have become disillusioned with the government. More than 1,000 hunt protesters demonstrated outside Westminster yesterday, severely disrupting traffic in central London and forcing Mr Blair to change his route. Meanwhile, inside the Commons Tories attacked the ban proposal as illiberal and intolerant and warned that pro-hunting groups would carry out a campaign of civil disobedience if it was approved. The three options before MPs are a complete ban; voluntary self-regulation, in which only hunts registered with the independent supervisory authority on hunting would be immune from prosecution on grounds of animal cruelty; or the compromise option favoured by Mr Straw. This would require all hunts to apply for a licence from a hunting authority, which would appoint inspectors to visit hunts and draw up codes of practice.",

Lieutenant General Carlo Cabigiosu met the Serbian deputy prime minister, Nebojsa Covic, in Bujanovac, close to where ethnic Albanian guerrillas and Yugoslav security forces have clashed over the last month. The meeting came hours after British troops arrested 13 ethnic Albanians found carrying a large number of heavy weapons. They had been travelling towards Serbia. Around the same time a UN police station in Serb-dominated northern Kosovo came under attack from machine-gun fire and a rocket-propelled grenade. No one was hurt. The talks in Serbia followed calls from the Yugoslav president, Vojislav Kostunica, for a renegotiation of a peace agreement which prevents Yugoslav troops entering a three-mile exclusion zone along the boundary with Kosovo. The area has been used by ethnic Albanian rebels to attack Serbian troops with virtual impunity. Calls for a change to the agreement have been repeated by Serb politicians in the run-up to Serbian parliamentary elections due this Saturday. But a K-For spokesman, Major Steve Shappell, denied that the accord, signed by Nato and Yugoslavia at the end of war in Kosovo, was up for discussion. \"There will be no change to the military technical agreement,\" he said. He added that the meeting was part of an \"ongoing dialogue to look for a peace solution to the situation\".

The soldiers had been deployed in the area the day before, specifically to prevent the flow of weapons and men across to Serbia. The weapons seized included 30 rocket-propelled grenades, 50 hand grenades, rocket launchers, anti-tank mines and heavy machineguns. The group was taken to the main American army base in the region, Camp Bondsteel, for questioning. While K-For has been concentrating its attention on the border with Serbia, the UN administration in Kosovo has been struggling to cope with a wave of violence in the north of the province. A UN spokeswomen, Susan Manuel, condemned the attack on the police station, which also houses the local council headquarters, as \"another act of mindless violence\". Four police cars were raked with automatic gunfire and another blown up by a grenade late on Tuesday night. A rocket-propelled grenade was fired through a window. Police were out on patrol at the time. The attack follows a weekend of violence in which one Serb was shot dead by K-For soldiers and seven Belgian troops were taken hostage for three hours in the town of Leposavic. Following the violence, the UN ordered its international and locally recruited police service and all UN personnel to withdraw from the town. \"We definitely think there is some kind of pattern going on.

Officers have compiled a collection of intelligence agents' favourite songs about their profession - the tunes chosen to help operatives to relax after a hard day's spying - to mark the country's annual Chekist's Day, which commemorates the establishment of the Soviet secret police, the Cheka, on December 20 1917. The CD, titled Being an Agent is Their Difficult Job, is unlikely to be a chartbuster in Russia, where memories of Stalinist secret police repression are fresh, so it will not go on sale to the public.

A fleeting extract from one patriotic ballad, sung by a retired officer, was broadcast on state television yesterday. Its mournful chorus is: \"The words intelligence, motherland and honour were always sacred to us.\" Boris Labusov, a spokesman for the Foreign Intelligence Service which is celebrating its 80th anniversary, said the songs had been chosen to represent the realities of life as an intelligence officer, and added that many of the lyrics would be incomprehensible to those not initiated in the traditions and jargon of the force. The project was primarily motivated by gratitude to retired officers, he said, many of whom missed the excitement of their years of service. \"I spoke to many veterans who admitted that they often dream at night of the Forest,\" he said, referring to the security services headquarters which are hidden in a forest at Yasenevo, near Moscow. \"We hoped to soften these moments of nostalgia for them by releasing this compact disc.\" Russia's most famous former spy is the president, Vladimir Putin, a career KGB officer.

      "bodyText": "Banning hunting with hounds is a \"wicked proposal\" with severe civil liberties implications, the Tories claimed yesterday. As several thousand pro-hunt protesters ringed Parliament, Conservative backbenchers said a ban would be an affront to the rights of minorities. \"This wicked proposal would separate liberty from justice and is a thoroughly undesirable thing to do,\" warned Nicholas Soames, MP for Mid Sussex. The former agriculture minister, John Gummer, said: \"This is a serious matter, very deep, about freedom, which, if it is carried through, will threaten every minority in this country.\" Tories also took the opportunity to link a hunting ban with the decline in police numbers, with Nigel Evans, MP for Ribble Valley, saying many of his rural constitutents rarely saw \"a local bobby\" and this situation could only worsen if officers were diverted into \"pursuing a group of people who have now become criminals\". Questioned on how many more police would be required to enforce the ban, the home secretary, Jack Straw, quoted an Association of Chief Police Officers estimate that the police resources channelled into this would be similar to those currently brought in to deal with protests by hunt saboteurs. Mr Straw stressed that after 22 failed backbench attempts to deal with fox hunting, the bill had not been determined by the government itself, but rather contained three options suggested by leading interest groups. The first option, self regulation, was put forward by the Countryside Alliance. The second option, regulation, was put forward by the Middle Way Group and based on the premise that hunting with dogs should be allowed to continue but only on a statutorily licensed basis. The third option, a complete ban, was put forward by the RSPCA, the League Against Cruel Sports and the International Fund for Animal Welfare.

If Parliament \"were to decide quite deliberately to take away the livelihood of even one man or woman in this country that would be a matter which should cause real heart-searching in the house\", he added. Describing the ban as \"misguided and unecessary\", Mr Lidington said the case for a ban on animal welfare grounds was \"shaky\". In animal welfare terms, a ban would lead to more wounded animals suffering due to different methods of animal control such as snaring and shooting. Labour MP Michael Foster, whose private member's bill to ban hunting was supported by 411 MPs in November 1997, said the chase involved in fox hunting inflicted unnecessary pain on the prey and that this chase was intrinsic to hunting. \"The chase is unnecessary but it is the very essence of the sport which is associated with hunting. \"It causes the animal unnecessary suffering and therefore is by definition cruel and no amount of regulatory approaches can fail to reach the same conclusion.\" The Burns inquiry had disproved hunters' claims that foxes suffered a quick death from \"a nip to the back of the neck\", he said, cataloguing the serious injuries uncovered by post mortems on hunted animals. He warned the end of hunting was nigh. \"For all those people that enjoy the ride, the countryside and the camaraderie, I say take the hint.

There were seven other girls there, some bigger, some smaller, all waiting on something they knew very little about.</p> <p>When an older girl told Ara that she was about to have her genitals cut, she fled, but one of the village women ran after her and brought her back. Four women did the cutting and they took the girls into a small hut, one by one.</p> <p>Ara winces as she speaks. \"They did it without an anaesthetic. I think I fainted. Four women held me down and they cut something, I don't know, maybe the clitoris, because I fainted and I didn't know anything else of what happened to me. When I woke up, I was in a hut. All of these girls, their legs were bandaged together and they were lying like that and they were not saying anything, but I screamed when I woke up. My grandmother said: 'Look at all these girls, it has happened to them, too'.\"</p> <p>The next thing Ara remembers is the pain - Ara was not just circumcised but infibulated, the most severe form of genital mutilation. \"You have pain, you have sores, you cannot wee, you cannot do anything for four or five days. You cannot get up, you cannot move. After this day, the woman who did the cutting comes back. They put a thorn through you to make the stitches and she comes back and rips it out and puts that stuff that smells horrible on you.</p> <p>\"Sometimes, the cutting doesn't heal up. What I will never forget in my life is that two of the girls' stitches never came together - when they take the thorn out, the skin must stitch together; if it comes apart, you have to do it again. Those two girls had to have it done again. Even now, if I see a knife or blood, I can't bear it. It shouldn't happen to anybody.\"</p> <p>Ara, who is from Somalia but now lives in east London, was a victim of female genital mutilation, one of 2m girls worldwide who have their genitals cut each year. The age of the child can vary; cutting can happen to babies as well as to young girls whose cultures believe it is a rite of passage.</p> <p>The prevalence of FGM in the UK is unknowable, the subject itself taboo. Euphemisms such as \"cutting the rose\" have allowed us to hide from its horrible reality. In the past, debates over cultural integrity - given credence by Germaine Greer's recent claim in her book The Whole Woman that \"one man's beautification is another man's mutilation\" - have distorted the issue.</p> <p>Now, though, FGM is becoming increasingly discussed in some major institutions and the brutality of the practice is clear. This week, a GP was struck off the register after he agreed to carry out genital mutilation at \u00a350 a time. Abdul Ahmed was videotaped in 1997 agreeing to cut an eight-year-old girl and \"circumcise and stitch\" two older girls. The General Medical Council did not believe his claims that he was talking about circumcising boys, not girls.</p> <p>Last month, the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Population, Development and Reproductive Health published its Parliamentary Hearings report on Female Genital Mutilation. At the same time, a conference in Brussels heard campaigners call for women to be allowed asylum if they were fleeing from the practice; the European Union is considering the implications of FGM as a fundamental abuse of human rights.</p> <p>The Parliamentary Hearings report notes that \"there is currently a severe shortage of data on the prevalence of FGM in the UK and overseas\". However, the hearings were told that around 6,000 girls in the UK are at risk of FGM.</p> <p>Comfort Momoh, an FGM specialist midwife with Guy's &amp; St Thomas', told MPs that since her clinic started in September 1997, over 300 women have turned up with FGM-related problems. The clinic carries out around 10 reversals every two weeks.</p> <p>Momoh said: \"It is a big problem and it is growing. We now have lots of communities that practise FGM migrating here because of domestic problems in African countries.\"</p> <p>The report calls on the government to change the law to ensure that adults who take children abroad to be cut will be prosecuted and to categorise FGM as a form of child abuse. Christine McCafferty MP, chair of the cross-party group, suggests that any reticence to act as a result of cross-cultural implications should be cast aside. \"It is not a question of culture or race. Cultures are sacred only if they are consistent with human rights. We should not be afraid to address this issue in the UK. By enforcing FGM legislation, we are ensuring that black children are not distinguished from white children. No child should suffer from the practice of FGM.\"</p> <p>FGM is the term used to refer to the removal of all or part of the female genitalia. The most severe form of this is infibulation - often known as pharaonic circumcision - which involves the removal of the clitoris, the labia majora and the labia minora. The majority of genital mutilation consists of clitoridectomy or excision; the least severe is the removal of the clitoral hood. The World Health Organisation now believes that the average age at which it is performed is falling.</p> <p>Girls can die as a result of FGM and those who don't are likely to have serious health problems. Many suffer shock, can haemorrhage and have infections. Those who practise FGM believe it maintains cleanliness, increases a girl's chances of marriage, protects her virginity, discourages promiscuity, improves fertility or prevents stillbirth. Ultimately, a \"sewn\" woman with a smaller opening will achieve a higher bride price.</p> <p>In 1985, FGM was outlawed in the UK, with the introduction of the Prohibition of Female Circumcision Act, but there have been no prosecutions to date. It is the lack of any real action or investigation into the prevalence of FGM in the UK that frustrates campaigners working to eradicate the practice.</p> <p>Shamiz Dirir is the director of the London Black Women's Health Action Project, a 17-year-old organisation which was one of the prime organisers behind the introduction of the 1985 Act. She believes female cutting is child abuse, but acknowledges that the communities that practice it do not recognise it as such.</p> <p>She says: \"It will take a long, long time to stop this. It's a deep-rooted habit. The government have said so many times that it has to be eradicated but they are not giving us the resources to do it. FGM is still happening and it is happening in this country, and if the government want to do something, they should do it quick.\" Dirir believes the law has to be altered to stop women taking their children away to have the mutilation done and to make sure people are not being brought here on a short holiday to have it done.</p> <p>In 1997, Forward, a charity that campaigns against FGM, uncovered four people who were willing to perform genital mutilation. Forward's acting director, Faith Mwangi-Powell, says FGM is undoubtedly going on in this country - she had even heard of one mother in Leicester with two four-week-old girls she was planning to have circumcised.</p> <p>\"It is very hard to establish,\" she points out, \"because people don't tell you whether they have had it done. In 1991, it was estimated that around 3,000 girls are done in this country. There's a chance that figure may have gone up because there are so many refugees who have come from practising countries.</p> <p>\"There are rumours. You speak to people one-to-one and they say, yes, you can have it done. Sometimes they will bring somebody over to do it.\"</p> <p>Mwangi-Powell believes the law must be tightened up and that the possibility of using customs officers to check whether children have been mutilated while on holiday may have to be considered. Most importantly, she says, it must be seen as a human rights issue. \"It's not really seen as that because the people who are practising it don't view it as a form of child abuse. They want to do it for their children and they mean well, but it's subjecting children to something terrible and they don't know what's happening to them.\"</p> <p>Khadija Coll was infibulated in her village in Kenya when she was just five years old. She now lives in Scotland and has set up a website to help educate people about the horrors of the practice. Like Dirir and Mwangi-Powell, she believes that education and increased awareness are the way forward.</p> <p>\"Some of my friends and relatives died from the operations,\" she says. \"They bled to death because there were no medical facilities around. I was very upset by this. They were very young and thinking about that made me realise it was child abuse.</p> <p>\"I want to educate women about the risk of FGM, to help them to be competent to talk about it. People are coming here from Africa and that's the only culture they know, and if they don't get educated about this issue, they will continue with it because it's their culture. The main thing is to teach women about the risk and that's a very difficult thing to do.\"</p>",

Those who practise FGM believe it maintains cleanliness, increases a girl's chances of marriage, protects her virginity, discourages promiscuity, improves fertility or prevents stillbirth. Ultimately, a \"sewn\" woman with a smaller opening will achieve a higher bride price. In 1985, FGM was outlawed in the UK, with the introduction of the Prohibition of Female Circumcision Act, but there have been no prosecutions to date. It is the lack of any real action or investigation into the prevalence of FGM in the UK that frustrates campaigners working to eradicate the practice. Shamiz Dirir is the director of the London Black Women's Health Action Project, a 17-year-old organisation which was one of the prime organisers behind the introduction of the 1985 Act. She believes female cutting is child abuse, but acknowledges that the communities that practice it do not recognise it as such. She says: \"It will take a long, long time to stop this. It's a deep-rooted habit. The government have said so many times that it has to be eradicated but they are not giving us the resources to do it. FGM is still happening and it is happening in this country, and if the government want to do something, they should do it quick.\" Dirir believes the law has to be altered to stop women taking their children away to have the mutilation done and to make sure people are not being brought here on a short holiday to have it done. In 1997, Forward, a charity that campaigns against FGM, uncovered four people who were willing to perform genital mutilation. Forward's acting director, Faith Mwangi-Powell, says FGM is undoubtedly going on in this country - she had even heard of one mother in Leicester with two four-week-old girls she was planning to have circumcised. \"It is very hard to establish,\" she points out, \"because people don't tell you whether they have had it done. In 1991, it was estimated that around 3,000 girls are done in this country. There's a chance that figure may have gone up because there are so many refugees who have come from practising countries. \"There are rumours. You speak to people one-to-one and they say, yes, you can have it done. Sometimes they will bring somebody over to do it.\" Mwangi-Powell believes the law must be tightened up and that the possibility of using customs officers to check whether children have been mutilated while on holiday may have to be considered. Most importantly, she says, it must be seen as a human rights issue. \"It's not really seen as that because the people who are practising it don't view it as a form of child abuse. They want to do it for their children and they mean well, but it's subjecting children to something terrible and they don't know what's happening to them.\" Khadija Coll was infibulated in her village in Kenya when she was just five years old. She now lives in Scotland and has set up a website to help educate people about the horrors of the practice. Like Dirir and Mwangi-Powell, she believes that education and increased awareness are the way forward. \"Some of my friends and relatives died from the operations,\" she says. \"They bled to death because there were no medical facilities around. I was very upset by this. They were very young and thinking about that made me realise it was child abuse. \"I want to educate women about the risk of FGM, to help them to be competent to talk about it. People are coming here from Africa and that's the only culture they know, and if they don't get educated about this issue, they will continue with it because it's their culture. The main thing is to teach women about the risk and that's a very difficult thing to do.\"",

The committee recommended that councils should only authorise flood plain development in exceptional circumstances, and that local plans should be revised to remove flood risk land from areas designated for development. Home buyers should also be told of the likelihood of their new home flooding with information on flood risk being a standard part of local authority searches. The price of houses on former flood plains should also reflect this risk. \"Information is the key thing when people are buying properties,\" added Mr Bennett, Labour's MP for Denton and Reddish. The report, which acknowledged flexibility was important in inner-city areas to ensure not all brown field developments were ruled out, was welcomed by the House Builders Federation for acknowledging that technological advances could help prevent flooding.",

      "body": "<p>Has a glass ever looked more half-full? And yet, at the same time, more half-empty? Those of us who have doubted Tony Blair's wisdom in applying this form of efficacy-evaluation to the political mainstream can only concede its aptness to the work of the national lottery commission, and hang our heads. For it is, in its way, a perfect summary of the lottery outcome. </p> <p>On the one hand the glass is half-full: Branson, the crown prince of gittishness, has lost. On the other, the glass is half-empty: Camelot, a practised gang of profiteers, has won. You don't know whether to laugh or cry, do you Tone? Well, you do actually. That little tear glistening in the corner of one of Branson's eyes, as he took in the tragic scale of this abrupt fortune-reversal, was the funniest thing since the death of little Nell. </p> <p>Then again, the revival of Camelot's fortunes must be terribly distressing for New Labour. It is only five years, after all, since the first waves of revulsion caused by Camelot's surging, \u00a31m-a-week profits had Blair and his shadow cabinet queueing up to denounce Camelot and promise their own, cleansing reforms. \"Camelot has a licence to print tickets and another to print money\", objected Jack Cunningham, then shadow heritage spokesman, who went on to describe the operator as \"another private monopoly set up by a Conservative government\". </p> <p>In his celebrated \"People's Lottery\" speech, Tony Blair confirmed that he would open bids for a non-profit-making operator in 2000, \"so we can release more money for the benefit of good causes\". He pointed out that \"No other country in Europe runs a private profit-making lottery\". Meanwhile, Chris Smith, shadow heritage secretary, declared that Labour would make sure that, \"the lottery serves the people\". He said: \"The government promised that the lottery would benefit every man, woman and child in Britain. Instead, the distribution of money has become a joke.\" </p> <p>Since when the joke has got progressively more side-splitting. In fact the story of Labour and the lottery is, in some ways, even more comically terrible than that of Labour and the dome. Labour had not, in opposition, set its face against the dome. And where the dome builders were culpably vainglorious, the lottery commissioners seem to have been plain thick. The great similarity between these two calamities, of course, is that no one of political consequence is going to be held accountable for the mess. </p> <p>Just as the dome emerged as a natural disaster, a force of nature no man could possibly have tamed, so the awarding of the lottery licence is already being portrayed as a task so impossibly huge and complex - think of all those awesome piles of papers! Think of all those big sums! - that we should be grateful that anyone has been found to run it at all, even the beastly old monopoly we all despised back in 1995. </p> <p>Like the genesis of the dome, the selection of a lottery licence will turn out to be so Byzantine a procedure that its complexities can never be satisfactorily explained. We shall never know, for example, why Smith chose to fill his spanking new quango, the national lottery commission, with five people who so consummately lacked any sign of having the \"wider range of knowledge, experience, and expertise\" that this body was supposed to \"bring to bear on lottery regulation\". The emergence of Dame Helena Shovelton will remain, for ever, a mystery. </p> <p>Perhaps the commission's task might have been easier had it received more bids. But when the deadline fell, it had just two to consider: one from the fat cats, one from the Cheshire. Branson, recently dubbed Sir Richard by Blair and appointed to Smith's creative industries taskforce, would describe winning the lottery as \"the most important thing in my life\". </p> <p>Why did he want it so? Not, we know, out of \"self-glorification\", because Branson has decided to sue Tom Bower, his unauthorised biographer, for supplying this explanation. But if not self-glorification, then what? The simple desire to do good? Possibly. Then again, a job as Britain's Lord Bountiful could not adversely affect Branson's other interests, all of which depend on the bearded person of Branson for their successful branding. </p> <p>Far from instilling doubts about his motivation, the potent Branson brand seemed to appeal powerfully to the commission's chairman Dame Helena and her band of Shoveltons. So much so, that when the dame announced in August that neither bid would do, it was Branson, alone, who got a second chance, a piece of favouritism which would have most toddlers reeling with sympathetic indignation. Branson exulted that his success would make it \"worthwhile being born\". </p> <p>Camelot, having been everywhere obituarised, successfully sought a judicial review. At this point another cabinet minister might have disbanded his commission and started again. Smith did not. In court, his commission defended itself on the grounds that its process had been like \"an architectural competition\", in which the People's Lottery had produced a building that was \"very nearly there\" (a claim which hardly conforms with this week's revised \"risky\" verdict). The judge, as we know, disagreed, describing the commission's behaviour as \"conspicuously unfair\", \"unlawful\" and \"an abuse of power\". </p> <p> Astonishingly, Dame Helena did not instantly resign. Quite the opposite: she defended her decision, and was, even more incredibly, supported by Smith - who presum ably believes that \"conspicuously unfair\" conduct is something that might afflict anyone. Only after a week did Dame Shovelton resentfully agree to go, attributing her departure - in a very dome-like way - to \"media vilification\". </p> <p>Her four, equally conspicuously unfair colleagues (for the judgment had been unanimous) chose - presumably with Smith's blessing - to remain. It must have been obvious to Lord Burns, Shovelton's successor, that the commission was now irredeemably discredited as well as none too bright - but thanks to the earlier prevarication and mistakes, there was now no time to replace these incompetents. </p> <p>The appointment of new commissioners, Lord Burns said, \"would delay the process by several months ... the risks regarding that are much greater than the risks in carrying on\". Well, we shall see.

      "bodyText": "Has a glass ever looked more half-full? And yet, at the same time, more half-empty? Those of us who have doubted Tony Blair's wisdom in applying this form of efficacy-evaluation to the political mainstream can only concede its aptness to the work of the national lottery commission, and hang our heads. For it is, in its way, a perfect summary of the lottery outcome. On the one hand the glass is half-full: Branson, the crown prince of gittishness, has lost. On the other, the glass is half-empty: Camelot, a practised gang of profiteers, has won. You don't know whether to laugh or cry, do you Tone? Well, you do actually. That little tear glistening in the corner of one of Branson's eyes, as he took in the tragic scale of this abrupt fortune-reversal, was the funniest thing since the death of little Nell. Then again, the revival of Camelot's fortunes must be terribly distressing for New Labour. It is only five years, after all, since the first waves of revulsion caused by Camelot's surging, \u00a31m-a-week profits had Blair and his shadow cabinet queueing up to denounce Camelot and promise their own, cleansing reforms. \"Camelot has a licence to print tickets and another to print money\", objected Jack Cunningham, then shadow heritage spokesman, who went on to describe the operator as \"another private monopoly set up by a Conservative government\". In his celebrated \"People's Lottery\" speech, Tony Blair confirmed that he would open bids for a non-profit-making operator in 2000, \"so we can release more money for the benefit of good causes\". He pointed out that \"No other country in Europe runs a private profit-making lottery\". Meanwhile, Chris Smith, shadow heritage secretary, declared that Labour would make sure that, \"the lottery serves the people\". He said: \"The government promised that the lottery would benefit every man, woman and child in Britain. Instead, the distribution of money has become a joke.\" Since when the joke has got progressively more side-splitting. In fact the story of Labour and the lottery is, in some ways, even more comically terrible than that of Labour and the dome. Labour had not, in opposition, set its face against the dome. And where the dome builders were culpably vainglorious, the lottery commissioners seem to have been plain thick. The great similarity between these two calamities, of course, is that no one of political consequence is going to be held accountable for the mess. Just as the dome emerged as a natural disaster, a force of nature no man could possibly have tamed, so the awarding of the lottery licence is already being portrayed as a task so impossibly huge and complex - think of all those awesome piles of papers! Think of all those big sums! - that we should be grateful that anyone has been found to run it at all, even the beastly old monopoly we all despised back in 1995. Like the genesis of the dome, the selection of a lottery licence will turn out to be so Byzantine a procedure that its complexities can never be satisfactorily explained. We shall never know, for example, why Smith chose to fill his spanking new quango, the national lottery commission, with five people who so consummately lacked any sign of having the \"wider range of knowledge, experience, and expertise\" that this body was supposed to \"bring to bear on lottery regulation\". The emergence of Dame Helena Shovelton will remain, for ever, a mystery. Perhaps the commission's task might have been easier had it received more bids. But when the deadline fell, it had just two to consider: one from the fat cats, one from the Cheshire. Branson, recently dubbed Sir Richard by Blair and appointed to Smith's creative industries taskforce, would describe winning the lottery as \"the most important thing in my life\". Why did he want it so? Not, we know, out of \"self-glorification\", because Branson has decided to sue Tom Bower, his unauthorised biographer, for supplying this explanation. But if not self-glorification, then what? The simple desire to do good? Possibly. Then again, a job as Britain's Lord Bountiful could not adversely affect Branson's other interests, all of which depend on the bearded person of Branson for their successful branding. Far from instilling doubts about his motivation, the potent Branson brand seemed to appeal powerfully to the commission's chairman Dame Helena and her band of Shoveltons. So much so, that when the dame announced in August that neither bid would do, it was Branson, alone, who got a second chance, a piece of favouritism which would have most toddlers reeling with sympathetic indignation. Branson exulted that his success would make it \"worthwhile being born\". Camelot, having been everywhere obituarised, successfully sought a judicial review. At this point another cabinet minister might have disbanded his commission and started again. Smith did not. In court, his commission defended itself on the grounds that its process had been like \"an architectural competition\", in which the People's Lottery had produced a building that was \"very nearly there\" (a claim which hardly conforms with this week's revised \"risky\" verdict). The judge, as we know, disagreed, describing the commission's behaviour as \"conspicuously unfair\", \"unlawful\" and \"an abuse of power\". Astonishingly, Dame Helena did not instantly resign. Quite the opposite: she defended her decision, and was, even more incredibly, supported by Smith - who presum ably believes that \"conspicuously unfair\" conduct is something that might afflict anyone. Only after a week did Dame Shovelton resentfully agree to go, attributing her departure - in a very dome-like way - to \"media vilification\". Her four, equally conspicuously unfair colleagues (for the judgment had been unanimous) chose - presumably with Smith's blessing - to remain. It must have been obvious to Lord Burns, Shovelton's successor, that the commission was now irredeemably discredited as well as none too bright - but thanks to the earlier prevarication and mistakes, there was now no time to replace these incompetents. The appointment of new commissioners, Lord Burns said, \"would delay the process by several months ... the risks regarding that are much greater than the risks in carrying on\". Well, we shall see. Burns will just have to hope that a spokesman for the People's Lottery was being honest, in October, when he said: \"We have absolute confidence that Lord Burns will be fair and impartial.\" Branson is not famed, however, for shrinking from litigation. On the contrary. According to Bower, Branson considered seeking a judicial review back in 1994, when he was first refused the lottery licence. This week he was already asking \"do we or do we not go to court?\" If he does go, then the referral of this extraordinary mess back to courts will be no more than the logical continuation of a saga which seems, in the absence of any competent leadership from those nominally in charge, to have been settled from the start, by the wrangling of professional lawyers.

But as Bob B Soxx, the ostensible leader of a group called the Blue Jeans, he briefly became one of the figures identified with the Wall of Sound, the style of pop music devised in the early 60s by the record producer Phil Spector, whose musical innovations and eccentric behaviour also established the archetype of the brilliant and autocratic Svengali of early rock and roll.</p> <p>Born in St Louis, Missouri, Sheen's family moved to southern California and, like Spector, he grew up in West Hollywood, then a mixed district. His early showbusiness experience came as a member of various touring versions of the Robins and the Coasters, two of the most popular Los Angeles vocal groups of the late 50s. A tall young man who dressed his hair in a fashionable pompadour, he sang in a high voice heavily influenced by Clyde McPhatter, who was the Drifters' first important lead singer in the early 50s before he embarked on a successful solo career.</p> <p>In 1962 Sheen hooked up with Spector through a recommendation from Lester Sill, a prominent Hollywood music business figure who had just gone into partnership with the 21-year-old pro ducer to form the Philles label. Spector was also briefly employed as head of A&amp;R for Liberty Records, and his first venture with Sheen was a single for that label titled How Many Days, a competent copy of McPhatter's solo records, recorded in New York.</p> <p>A few months later Spector moved his recording operation to Los Angeles, where he booked time at a studio, Gold Star, located at the corner of Santa Monica Boulevard and Vine Street. The site of many hit recordings, Gold Star was noted for its exceptionally resonant echo chamber, located in the bathroom. It also employed a young engineer, Larry Levine, who was eager to collaborate in Spector's more unorthodox notions. Their first session together produced He's A Rebel, released under the name of the Crystals, even though all the singing was done by session singers - one of whom was Sheen. It was at a second Gold Star session, in the autumn of 1962, that Sheen found himself singing the lead part on a version of Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah, a children's song from a 1940 Walt Disney film, Song Of The South, which Spector had reimagined as a mini-epic of avant-garde rhythm and blues.</p> <p>At the session, Spector had assembled three guitarists, three bass players, at least two pianists, four saxophonists, a drummer and a percussionist. Levine spent almost three hours trying vainly to capture the correct sound balance on the studio's primitive three-track desk. In frustration, he turned off all the microphones. One by one he turned them back on, until Spector shouted: \"That's it! That's the sound!\" But one microphone had been inadvertently left off, and the distant, metallic sound of Billy Strange's electric guitar solo leaking into the microphones of the other musicians became the signature of a record also distinguished by the disembodied clanging of its weirdly ponderous rhythm track - a sound unlike anything heard before. A top 10 hit over the Christmas of 1962, it helped prepare the way for the records by the Crystals and the Ronettes which established Philles as the last great phenomenon before the arrival of the Beatles ended pop's age of innocence.</p> <p>With Darlene Love and Fanita James, two session singers who did duty as the Blue Jeans, Sheen released two more Bob B Soxx singles in 1963, the charming Why Do Lovers Break Each Other's Heart? and the rowdy Not Too Young To Get Married, on both of which Love sang the lead part - as she had, uncredited, on He's A Rebel and the Crystals' next hit, He's Sure The Boy I Love.</p> <p>When neither Bob B Soxx follow-up matched the success of Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah, Spector turned his interest elsewhere. But the group's final appearance, as contributors to the producer's legendary Christmas Album, also permitted Sheen his finest hour, delivering a soaring lead vocal on a magnificently thunderous arrangement of The Bells Of St Mary's. An unlikely vehicle for one of Spector's \"little symphonies for the kids\", it now seems fully the equal of Be My Baby or River Deep - Mountain High, the acknowledged classics of Spector's Wagnerian style.</p> <p>Sheen signed a contract with Capitol, and in 1966 released an excellent single called Dr Love, which failed to make the pop charts but nevertheless found - and continues to find - favour with the dancers of Britain's northern soul scene (an original UK promo copy is currently available on an internet site for \u00a360). Later, he resumed his earlier career as a member of one of several groups trading under the name of the Coasters, and for a while ran a label of his own, Salsa Picante.

The frail, bespectacled pensioner, painfully thin and ghostly pale in a neat navy blue suit, sat bolt upright listening intently to every word in the Belfast court of appeal's 52-page judgment summary. It took just over an hour for Sir Robert Carswell, Northern Ireland's lord chief justice, to read the finding, but it was the verdict that the 68-year-old Glaswegian had waited 48 years to hear: not guilty of the notorious killing that shocked 1950s Ulster.

      "body": "<p>John V Lindsay, who has died aged 79, was one of the last of the breed of liberal Republicans in American politics. Mayor of New York City from 1965 to 1973, he was briefly, as a Democrat, a presidential contender in 1972.</p> <p>Linday presided over a time of union turmoil, rising crime and angry racial and political conflict in New York. He showed great physical courage in confronting rioting mobs in Harlem in 1967, but became involved in damaging confrontations with New York's teachers over \"community control\" of schools, and with the police over a proposed civilian review board. He left the city headed for the financial crisis that left it all but bankrupt two years after he had gone from office.</p> <p>As a white Anglo-Saxon protestant from an upper-class background, Lindsay belonged to one of the smallest ethnic minorities in a city whose politics were largely defined by ethnicity, and that was bitterly divided in the 1960s between Jews and Catholics, whites and blacks. Elected to his first term as mayor largely by middle-class voters, he was widely seen as siding with poor black and Puerto Rican and some Jewish voters against middle-class Irish and Italian voters, and ended up being re-elected largely with black and hispanic votes. It was Lindsay's misfortune to serve as mayor of America's biggest city at the height of the urban crisis brought on by the coincidence of racial conflict, labour unrest, rashly generous liberal reforms, fiscal improvidence and political confusion.</p> <p>He won election with the help of a campaign in the friendly New York Herald Tribune calling it \"a city in crisis\", and in many ways he left it a city in crisis too. Yet in spite of numerous mistakes, and the turbulent, troubled character of his years in Gracie Mansion, the mayoral residence, he has come to be seen as one of New York's better mayors.</p> <p>When he left office in 1973 the New York Times acknowledged that he had alienated \"blue collar and middle-class citizens\", but judged that his accomplishments would \"place him securely among the outstanding mayors of New York. And mayor Kevin White of Boston, another gifted man frustrated by the angry racial politics of the time, called Lindsay \"probably the most significant politician in the history of municipal government in doing something for the cities\".</p> <p>Lindsay came from an upper-class family. His father was an investment banker and he was educated at the private boarding Buckley School, at St Paul's School, Concord, and at Yale University. He became a lawyer with the long-established New York firm of Webster and Sheffield. In 1958, aged 27, after serving briefly as a government lawyer in the Eisenhower administration, he was elected to Congress from the 14th \"Silk Stocking\" district on Manhattan's East Side; the wealthiest congressional district in the United States.</p> <p>Six foot four, with blond hair and greenish eyes, Lindsay was often compared to John F Kennedy, and the same adjectives were applied to him as to Kennedy, four years his senior: patrician, elegant, cool, glamorous, stylish. He was fascinating to the media, and adept at manipulating them. From an early stage in his career he thought in terms of an eventual run for the presidency. But he was handicapped by his particular brand of Republican politics, which had an appeal to the predominantly liberal inhabitants of the Silk Stocking district, but was already going out of style by the late 1950s.</p> <p>Lindsay belonged to the \"goo-goo\" tradition of Republican liberalism, so called by its opponents both in the Democratic party, dominated in New York by working-class Irish politicians, and in the increasingly conservative Republican party. Lindsay had an aristocratic disdain for corruption, which was rife among both politicians and policemen in New York in those days, and for racial prejudice, destined to be a menacing factor in the city's politics in his time.</p> <p>In 1964, Lindsay was already sufficiently disillusioned with the party's shift to the right that he refused to endorse its conservative candidate for the presidency, Senator Barry Goldwater. In spite of the twin handicaps of birth and liberalism, Lindsay was elected mayor in 1965. He was a glamorous as well as a gracious figure. Few other mayors of New York, certainly none since his time, would have played the lead in a white tie and tails sketch at a press party supposed to lampoon him, dancing in the Fred Astaire manner with beautiful actresses. He gathered a brilliant assembly of aides around him, generally assumed to be the nucleus of a Kennedy-style Camelot that would take the shuttle down to Washington in due course.</p> <p>When Lindsay moved into Gracie Mansion on New Year's Day 1966, a tiny shamrock was lying on his desk. It was an ominous reminder left behind by his Democratic opponents, of the tough Irish labour boss, Mike Quill, who brought the city's buses and subway trains to a halt on Lindsay's first day in office.</p> <p>That was only the beginning of a time of labour disputes and disruptions comparable to the \"winter of discontent\" in Britain a decade and more later. The bus and subway strike was said to have been the \"costliest and most paralysing\" strike in American history. In 1968 the policemen went on a \"sick-out\", and the teachers and dustmen were on strike. In 1971 it was the turn of the bridge tenders, the sewage workers and the policemen again. Potentially most dangerous of all was the firemen's strike in 1973.</p> <p>Yet although the period bulks large in New Yorkers' memories as a time of labour disturbances, the actual number of days lost through strikes was not especially high, and Lindsay succeeded in bringing a new efficiency and rationality to labour negotiations.</p> <p>An admirer of Kennedy's hyper-numerate defence secretary, Robert McNamara, Lindsay also adopted managerial modernity to New York's government. He reorganised it into eight \"super-agencies\" and shook up the ancient cosy ways of patronage and plunder. Yet it was in his day that New York's finances began to deteriorate, thanks to reckless short-term borrowing that brought the city to the brink of bankruptcy in the mid-70s. New York was largely dependent for money on New York State, and Lindsay was on terrible terms with the state's Republican governor, Nelson Rockefeller. Throughout his time in office he quarrelled with Rockefeller, who had been one of his original sponsors, but who may well have been jealous of Lindsay's political appeal and ambitions.</p> <p>Lindsay first installed a social worker, Mitchell Ginsberg, to run welfare. The welfare rolls promptly shot up, from 500,000 recipients in 1965 to 1.2m in 1969 - one in six of the population. The cost kept pace, going from $500m to $1.2bn. In 1969, realising that welfare spending was deeply unpopular, Lindsay changed tack and appointed a tough manager, Jule Sugarman, who held the line on numbers and costs.</p> <p>It was only a couple of years after Lindsay left Gracie Mansion, however, that the New York Daily News ran its famous headline about President Ford's unwilling ness to back a federal bail-out for New York's budget: \"Ford To City: Drop Dead\".</p> <p>His attempt to reform New York's once magnificent but already troubled, public school system turned out to be catastrophic. Lindsay brought in the Ford Foundation, led by President Kennedy's immensely able national security adviser, McGeorge Bundy, to advise how to tackle racial problems in the schools.</p> <p>The foundation recommended \"community control\", which meant handing over control of the teachers, two thirds of them Jewish, and their powerful union, to local boards of control. In one district, Ocean Hill-Brownsville in Brooklyn, once the heart of New York's Jewish community, but by 1968 largely black, this led to angry confrontations and to a teachers' strike that left lasting resentments between blacks and many Jews.</p> <p>That was absolutely the last thing Lindsay and his allies had intended. Yet Dr Kenneth B Clark, the black sociologist who had proposed the decentralisation plan, himself came to the conclusion that it had been \"disastrous\". The Ocean Hill-Brownsville affair had a lasting and damaging effect on the politics of the city, since in the past Jews and African Americans had formed a powerful liberal bloc; now many Jews drifted to the \"neo-conservative\" right, while many black New Yorkers were alienated from mainstream politics and driven to back more or less demagogic black politicians.</p> <p>When he came into office. Lindsay issued a \"white paper on crime and safety\". \"We will make New York City safe again,\" it promised, \"no matter what the cost, no matter what the effort.\" The police department's strength grew from 24,000 to more than 30,000 in Lindsay's time, and a lot of money was invested in walkie-talkies and other new technology. But opinions differed as to whether New York was any safer - many thought it was not.</p> <p>The mayor also instituted a civilian police review board which deeply alienated many of \"New York's finest\". He set up a commission to fight corruption after a shocking investigation by the New York Times, but the commission found that corruption was endemic and \"indulged in to some degree by a sizeable majority of those on the force\", and that Lindsay's administration had done little about it.</p> <p>In 1969, guided by a brilliant journalist, Richard Aurelio, as his campaign manager, Lindsay was re-elected with only 42% of the vote, the city's new conservative majority being divided between a conservative Democrat, Mario Procaccini, and a conservative Republican, John Marchi.</p> <p>The most remarkable thing about the re-election was the fact that Lindsay won with a completely different constituency in 1969 from that which had brought him into office in 1965. In his first election, he was supported by the Republican establishment of Wall Streeters and political lawyers, leading the city's largely Catholic middle class. In 1969, he found himself the tribune of the poor and disinherited blacks and Hispanics, while middle-class Jews, Irish and Italians for various reasons turned their backs on him.</p> <p>When Lindsay left office, it was widely assumed that he had a promising political career ahead of him. In fact, he disappeared almost totally from political sight. At a time when the centre of gravity of American political life was moving to the right, he moved rapidly in the opposite direction.</p> <p>Already in 1968 he came down on the side of the city's black and poor citizens, angering the middle class. In that year, too, he was spoken of as a possible vice-presidential candidate for the Republicans, but was persuaded to endorse the disastrous Spiro T Agnew, subsequently forced to resign for bribery. Asked how he could have done such a thing, Lindsay's salty-spoken wife Mary said \"politics acquaints a man with strange bedfellows\".</p> <p>In late 1971, typically after a skiing holiday in Colorado, he announced that he was becoming a Democrat. This was supposed to be the opening move in a campaign for the presidency. The idea was that the newly radicalised Lindsay would knock out George McGovern in the early primaries and challenge Richard Nixon in the November election. It didn't work out like that. Jewish voters, on whom he had counted, were particularly disillusioned with him, according to the New York Times.</p> <p>Lindsay made little impact and withdrew after being badly beaten in the Wisconsin and Florida primaries. It was generally assumed that he would have a glittering future somewhere, somehow, in American politics. But the caravan had moved on.</p> <p>Lindsay returned to practising law in Manhattan, but even that was not a great success. He worked for two law firms, both of which were dissolved. His later years were sad. Both his health and his finances deteriorated. He was badly hurt when a dog knocked him off his bicycle in Central Park.</p> <p>He had heart surgery in 1988, suffered a mild stroke in 1989 and was taken to hospital in 1990 after collapsing with low blood pressure at a public luncheon. In 1994, he had to be taken by ambulance to hospital after feeling faint on a hot, steamy day while waiting for a train at Track 18 in Grand Central station.</p> <p>His wealth as well as his health suffered. In May 1996 mayor Rudolph Giulani agreed to find him two city jobs because Lindsay was broke; the jobs would qualify him for city health insurance and perhaps later for a pension.

      "bodyText": "John V Lindsay, who has died aged 79, was one of the last of the breed of liberal Republicans in American politics. Mayor of New York City from 1965 to 1973, he was briefly, as a Democrat, a presidential contender in 1972. Linday presided over a time of union turmoil, rising crime and angry racial and political conflict in New York. He showed great physical courage in confronting rioting mobs in Harlem in 1967, but became involved in damaging confrontations with New York's teachers over \"community control\" of schools, and with the police over a proposed civilian review board. He left the city headed for the financial crisis that left it all but bankrupt two years after he had gone from office. As a white Anglo-Saxon protestant from an upper-class background, Lindsay belonged to one of the smallest ethnic minorities in a city whose politics were largely defined by ethnicity, and that was bitterly divided in the 1960s between Jews and Catholics, whites and blacks. Elected to his first term as mayor largely by middle-class voters, he was widely seen as siding with poor black and Puerto Rican and some Jewish voters against middle-class Irish and Italian voters, and ended up being re-elected largely with black and hispanic votes. It was Lindsay's misfortune to serve as mayor of America's biggest city at the height of the urban crisis brought on by the coincidence of racial conflict, labour unrest, rashly generous liberal reforms, fiscal improvidence and political confusion. He won election with the help of a campaign in the friendly New York Herald Tribune calling it \"a city in crisis\", and in many ways he left it a city in crisis too. Yet in spite of numerous mistakes, and the turbulent, troubled character of his years in Gracie Mansion, the mayoral residence, he has come to be seen as one of New York's better mayors. When he left office in 1973 the New York Times acknowledged that he had alienated \"blue collar and middle-class citizens\", but judged that his accomplishments would \"place him securely among the outstanding mayors of New York.

Shares in the company climbed 8p to 48.5p after a statement said a mystery party was mulling an offer expected to be at least 60p per share. Rival golf operator Crown Sports and a venture capital backed management buyout team are seen as the most likely suitors. However, analysts said leisure groups such as De Vere and Whitbread should not be discounted. Clubhaus shares have landed in the rough, under-performing the wider leisure sector by 42% this year. Management has been unable to hack its way out of the slump despite the booming popularity of golf - with record-breaking performances from young golf stars like Tiger Woods, Lee Westwood and Sergio Garcia encouraging more young people than ever before to pick up a set of clubs. Clubhaus has attempted to accommodate that shift by developing a more family focused atmosphere at its courses and adding on country club facilities like health clubs and spas. With 21 clubs across Britain, Germany, Spain and Italy and 26,000 members, it is Europe's largest quoted golf club operator. Group revenues climbed 40% in the half year, as membership grew 21%.

His, he proudly reveals, is Mrs Doubtfire. At which point his potential partner decides that they have no future together. </p> <p>So maybe my friend is a massive snob, but most of us have made that kind of judgment at some point or other. Partly, it is a matter of aesthetic judgment, but there is also the worrying thought that someone wants to be Robin Williams ineptly impersonating a Scottish housekeeper. Because we instinctively feel that your taste in films, like your taste in music or books, must reveal something about who you really are. </p> <p>Which is why we read about celebrities' CD collections, or watch something like FilmFour's Doubletake, in which vaguely famous people get to programme a couple of films, all of which gives us a chance to play armchair shrink as well as howling at bad taste. If I were to tell you that Craig from Big Brother's favourite films were Four Weddings And A Funeral and The Usual Suspects, what do we learn about him? Initially, that he is a master of the obvious with an eye for the consensus. Some people might hate one of the films, some the other, but only the truly difficult will hate both. </p> <p>\"He would appear to have those two sides to him: the sensitive new man and the original macho violent instinct\", suggests Dr Glenn Wilson of the Institute of Psychiatry. Ponder a little more, though, and the choice of The Usual Suspects begins to look interesting. Maybe Craig is drawn in by the story of an unassuming, seemingly ineffectual little man who turns out to have been the ruthless mastermind all along, controlling the people who thought they were using him. </p> <p>But is there any academic basis to this? \"You can learn something about a person from all their choices in life,\" argues Andrew Samuels, professor of analytical psychology at Essex University, \"assuming they have got room to make choices. The technical jargon for this is that people project something of themselves in whatever they like, so that in the case of someone who likes action movies this is often part of themselves that they haven't really developed very much. People identify with a character who least resembles what they are like. People live vicariously through movies, novels, artworks.\" </p> <p>Of course, a lot depends on how genuine their choices are. Craig couldn't pick any two films: he was limited to FilmFour's inherently respectable repertoire; no chance to chose Revenge Of The Nerds V or Mortal Kombat: Annihilation. But even given total freedom, people often bluff, according to Dr Wilson. </p> <p>\"I think people would be immediately on their guard that they would be giving something away about themselves. I doubt that they would be one hundred per cent honest. They would be managing the impression. If you knew it was going in the paper you wouldn't say you watched nothing but pornography...\" </p> <p>Equally, people don't want to appear too intellectual, Professor Samuels argues. \"I have noticed the way that highbrow people forcefully demonstrate that they are really plebeian by coming up with satisfactorily earthy movies of one kind or another. There is a bit of cultural second guessing going on.\" And a bit of blatant provocation, too, judging by Nick Bateman's choice of man-impersonates-doctor thriller Paper Mask for his Doubletake. </p> <p>If people do tell the truth, though, can their choices be of any use to practising psychologists? Say a patient lets slip to their therapist that they are inseparable from their DVD of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, does it reveal anything? \"Yes and no\", says Dr Wilson. \"I think the facts show that people of a violent disposition do enjoy violence in the media, but I don't think it necessarily goes back the other way. It raises the possibility, but on the other hand the violence in the film might be an outlet. It suggests that it is there somewhere, but it's not necessarily going to break out into serial killing!\" </p> <p>In fact, violent films can be therapeutic, he says. \"If you don't have violence in your life, you might want to see Gladiator, and that would be a sufficient dose of violence such as you wouldn't want to go out on the street and mug anybody.\" </p> <p>It's not all psychology. We are also engaging in amateur sociology every time we try to read people's tastes. The Big Brother Doubletake reveals Melanie is a fan of Krzysztof Kieslowski's Three Colours: Blue, which is a reminder of the glaring fact, obscured by race and sex, that Melanie was the most overwhelmingly bourgeois of the guinea pigs. </p> <p>Ultimately, though, Andrew Samuels is sceptical about how much we can learn from favourite film lists and TV slots. \"People are telling you their favourite films, but what one really needs to know is what their favourite image is, who their favourite star is, one needs to know why . You need what it is about the movie that Brad Pitt is thinking about when he or his publicist decides that he likes that film. I think one needs to second-guess this whole enterprise.\" </p> <p>This is the Catch-22 of the whole notion: we want to use films and books as a short cut to understanding people, but only if we understand the way their mind works do their choices tell us much. Although avoiding people with alove of Robin Williams movies still looks like a decent bet. </p> <p>\u0095 Big Brother contestants will be picking their favourite films from December 24, FilmFour.</p>",

It suggests that it is there somewhere, but it's not necessarily going to break out into serial killing!\" In fact, violent films can be therapeutic, he says. \"If you don't have violence in your life, you might want to see Gladiator, and that would be a sufficient dose of violence such as you wouldn't want to go out on the street and mug anybody.\" It's not all psychology. We are also engaging in amateur sociology every time we try to read people's tastes. The Big Brother Doubletake reveals Melanie is a fan of Krzysztof Kieslowski's Three Colours: Blue, which is a reminder of the glaring fact, obscured by race and sex, that Melanie was the most overwhelmingly bourgeois of the guinea pigs. Ultimately, though, Andrew Samuels is sceptical about how much we can learn from favourite film lists and TV slots. \"People are telling you their favourite films, but what one really needs to know is what their favourite image is, who their favourite star is, one needs to know why . You need what it is about the movie that Brad Pitt is thinking about when he or his publicist decides that he likes that film. I think one needs to second-guess this whole enterprise.\" This is the Catch-22 of the whole notion: we want to use films and books as a short cut to understanding people, but only if we understand the way their mind works do their choices tell us much. Although avoiding people with alove of Robin Williams movies still looks like a decent bet. \u0095 Big Brother contestants will be picking their favourite films from December 24, FilmFour.",

The move to begin cloning the animal was prompted by unsuccessful attempts to increase its population using in virtro fertilisation and artificial insemination. </p> <p>Pandas are notorious for their feeble efforts when it comes to mating. Even in the wild, where their sex drive may be higher, the survival rate of the cubs is very low: more than half of them die shortly after birth. </p> <p>Unusually, this summer six panda cubs were born in the Wolong Giant Panda Reserves in the south west province of Sichuan, in China. However, zoologists were reluctant to join in the celebrations: it is widely held that the panda will become extinct within 10 years. Three years ago, researchers at the Cheng Du Zoo and the biology department of the United University of Sichuan successfully cloned a gene linked to a nervous disorder, one which commonly leads to death in giant pandas. A year later, Dr Chen Dayuan, from China's Academy of Sciences, began a research programme aimed at cloning a panda. </p> <p>Dayuan took the nucleus from the cell of an adult panda (this is the part of the cell that contains all the genetic material) and inserted it into an egg from a rabbit which had had its nucleus removed, to produce a ball of cells that could become a panda embryo. </p> <p>So far this step has proved successful. The difficulty will be growing a panda out of a collection of cells. Dayuan is currently looking for suitable surrogate mothers and is considering black and sloth bears as candidates. Dayuan hopes to have a panda clone within the next five years. </p> <p>Not everyone in China is in favour of trying to clone the panda. One of the country's leading panda experts, Dr Pan Wenshi, has studied them in the wild for two decades. He believes that attempts to clone this rare animal will detract from efforts to preserve the species in the wild. </p> <p>He has also dismissed the widely accepted theory that the panda's threatened extinction is due to its decline in fertility. He argues that the main reason pandas are an emdangered species is because humans have decimated their habitat. </p> <p>Meanwhile, in Australia, attempts to clone an extinct species, the Tasmanian tiger, have begun. This is not a cat at all, but rather a wolf-like marsupial wiped out by British settlers, who blamed them for killing sheep and other farm animals. A bounty was even put on the animal's head in 1888. As a result, the last Tasmanian tiger died in a zoo in 1936. </p> <p>The great white hope of the Australian Museum in Sydney is a six-month-old Tasmanian tiger pup preserved in alcohol since 1866. Researchers have already extracted samples from the dead animal's heart, liver, muscles and bone marrow. These DNA samples, approximately 2,000 bases long, will be used to create a genetic library. Its genes will then be inserted into the egg of a close relative, probably the Tasmanian devil or the numbat, another marsupial. </p> <p>Dr Don Colgan, head of the evolutionary biology depart ment of the Australian Museum, believes that it could take 10 to 15 years before the tiger is successfully cloned. Other scientists are sceptical whether the project will work at all, or whether it should even be carried out. </p> <p>\"This is just boys playing with genetic toys,\" says Michael Lynch, manager of the Tasmanian Conservation Trust in Hobart. \"We could better take that money and put it into saving the species we humans are driving to extinction every year,\" he adds. </p> <p>However, Colgan argues that his team's research will create new scientific break-throughs that will help conservation efforts in other species. </p> <p>\"From an evolutionary biologist's point of view, we should be looking at the longer term, such as 200 to 300 years ahead,\" Colgan says, \"And this whole research area is where you should be looking if you really want to save species.\"</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>In the wake of the Claire Swires email furore, it has finally become apparent why employers are so keen for us to not to send out \"personal\" emails. Not because of fears for decreasing productivity, but because, like Norton Rose - which has overnight become the best-known law firm in the western world - they do not want their name all over a real-life corporate- sponsored knob gag read by a few million people. </p> <p>Be honest now, when you read \"that email\", was there any hesitation about immediately sending it to a dozen of your nearest and dearest? </p> <p>I certainly pondered, and may I say that I am quietly proud of those two or three seconds of rumination before I pressed the Send button. The reason it took so little deliberation for me was simple - I just did not believe it. </p> <p>I was not the only one either. The normally excellent technology news site <a href=\"http://www.theregister.co.uk\">The Register</a> was taken in too. At the start of the week, days before Old Media got hold of it, The Register asked \"Is this the Greatest Ever Email Hoax?\", positing that Claire Swires was a figment of Bradley Chait's imagination. </p> <p>Of course, the truth is that poor old Miss Swires was the victim of an exemplary case of 21st century Peter and the Wolf. Everybody has been hoaxed by email at one point or another, and we are just not sure who to believe any more, be it the plea to send old T-shirts to Colombia to pay for little Juan's lifesaving operation, the chain email that purports to be from Microsoft and Disney that will earn you a free trip to Disneyland, or my favourite: the Yale University graduation speech allegedly made by Oracle supremo and billionaire Larry Ellison. The hoax begins: \"As I look out before me today, I don't see a thousand hopes for a bright tomorrow. I don't see a thousand future leaders in a thousand industries. I see a thousand losers.\" </p> <p>So where should you look if you do not want to find yourself looking a bit silly? For starters you should visit <a href=\"http://www.urbanlegends.com\">www.urbanlegends.com</a>. Urban Legends has been going since 1991, and does not just deal with internet hoaxes.

      "bodyText": "In the wake of the Claire Swires email furore, it has finally become apparent why employers are so keen for us to not to send out \"personal\" emails. Not because of fears for decreasing productivity, but because, like Norton Rose - which has overnight become the best-known law firm in the western world - they do not want their name all over a real-life corporate- sponsored knob gag read by a few million people. Be honest now, when you read \"that email\", was there any hesitation about immediately sending it to a dozen of your nearest and dearest? I certainly pondered, and may I say that I am quietly proud of those two or three seconds of rumination before I pressed the Send button. The reason it took so little deliberation for me was simple - I just did not believe it. I was not the only one either. The normally excellent technology news site The Register was taken in too. At the start of the week, days before Old Media got hold of it, The Register asked \"Is this the Greatest Ever Email Hoax?\", positing that Claire Swires was a figment of Bradley Chait's imagination. Of course, the truth is that poor old Miss Swires was the victim of an exemplary case of 21st century Peter and the Wolf. Everybody has been hoaxed by email at one point or another, and we are just not sure who to believe any more, be it the plea to send old T-shirts to Colombia to pay for little Juan's lifesaving operation, the chain email that purports to be from Microsoft and Disney that will earn you a free trip to Disneyland, or my favourite: the Yale University graduation speech allegedly made by Oracle supremo and billionaire Larry Ellison. The hoax begins: \"As I look out before me today, I don't see a thousand hopes for a bright tomorrow. I don't see a thousand future leaders in a thousand industries. I see a thousand losers.\" So where should you look if you do not want to find yourself looking a bit silly? For starters you should visit www.urbanlegends.com. Urban Legends has been going since 1991, and does not just deal with internet hoaxes. Its remit is much broader than that - it deals with any online or offline urban legend. The site describes an urban legend as a story that \"appears mysteriously and spreads spontaneously in varying forms\" and \"contains elements of humor or horror (the horror often 'punishes' someone who flouts society's conventions).\" So it's easy to see why most of us thought the Claire Swires email was a put-up job by someone with too much time on their hands. A site that not only identifies the latest potential hoaxes, but also digs around to find out whether they are true or not, is the impressive www.snopes2.com . Such is the boundary-free aspect of the internet that it has all the lowdown on the Swires email. The truly gullible would do well to spend five minutes browsing David Spalding's informative Hoax du jour page at http://korova.com/virus/ .

Windows almost never has enough real memory (Ram chips), so it stores pages of code it isn't using in a large file (Win386.swp) on the hard drive.

This lets you set minimum and maximum sizes for the swap file, and move it to another drive or partition. </p> <p>Some people find that defragmenting the drive and fixing the size of the swap file can increase performance, since this avoids the swap file growing and shrinking over a patchwork of disk space. However, in my experience, Windows is usually best if left to manage its own swap file. </p> <p>But there is one useful change to make at this point. Click the File System button, and on the Hard Disk page, change the setting for \"Typical role of this computer\" to Network server. This will allocate more memory for handling file directories. </p> <p>The Performance tab of System Properties also tells you how many resources Windows has free, though it is not the most convenient place to look. For a quick update, use Windows Explorer: the raw number is under the Help|About menu option. Further information is also available from the Resource Meter in Start| Programs|Accessories| System Tools. The Resource Meter runs as a background program, but you can get the details by double-clicking the icon in the System Tray (Systray) next to the clock on the far right of the Task Bar. </p> <p>Most of Windows's problems start when it runs out of resources, so it is doubly unfortunate that one of the worst resource leaks is Internet Explorer. Opening and closing a lot of browser windows consumes resources because IE fails to release them properly afterwards. </p> <p>When resources are below 25%, Windows' performance starts to deteriorate, and when the number falls below 10%, you are heading for a crash. You can usually get some resources back by closing all program windows, including Windows Explorer, and waiting a couple of minutes for Windows to sort itself out.

It is less convenient to run these things separately but it may be worth the effort. </p> <p>Some Systray programs can be disabled by right-clicking them and selecting the appropriate configuration. Some can be disabled by removing them from the StartUp folder. In Windows 98 and Me, some can be disabled by selecting Start|Run and typing msconfig to run the configuration utility.

      "body": "<p> The pill of choice for many people in 2000 was one that had no taste, and absolutely no effect on their digestive system: the Combat Boost. Other gamers will fondly remember the year as the one that first let them set up a love triangle in a virtual household, skate along the tops of bus shelters and deface police cars with aerosol paint, or - most bizarrely of all - get a job in an imaginary world. </p> <p>It was also the year that saw much-hyped games failing to deliver on their promises. Jon Romero's Daikatana (PC) turned out to be a fat, stinking dog, while the laudably creative ideas in Shiny's Messiah (PC) or Sega's Shenmue (DC) never gelled into outstanding games. Shenmue (the game where you had to get a job) created a jaw-droppingly beautiful and detailed environment, but in it you spent most of your time walking up to people and pressing A, or hanging around looking at your watch. It's very clever to simulate the tedium of everyday life, but in the end it's still tedious. </p> <p>Perfect Dark (N64), meanwhile, the long-awaited \"spiritual sequel\" to Goldeneye that finally hit the shelves in the summer, was fascinating and horribly flawed in equal measure. Its great achievement was an astonishing array of beautifully designed gadgetry. Here were the Combat Boost (a pill that slowed down time to enable you to rescue hostages with John Woo-style headshots to kidnappers), the Farsight (a weapon that could aim and shoot through walls), and the superb Laptop Gun, a rapid-fire weapon that could be deployed on walls as a friendly comrade. </p> <p>But the attempt to characterise the game's heroine, Joanna Dark, as a post-Lara Croft cyberbabe fell laughably flat, and the gruesomely bad cut-scenes attempted to tell an increasingly absurd and incoherent pulp sci-fi story. What was most galling was the framerate problem: the screen update slowed to a jerky crawl at higher difficulty levels, and all the time in the co-operative and counter-operative mission modes, thus rendering some interesting ideas thoroughly unplayable. </p> <p>Elsewhere, other developers were also asking current videogame hardware to do more than was strictly possible, and gameplay always suffered as a result. Vastly hyped for its pre-Christmas appearance, for example, was 1970s mission-driving sequel Driver 2, a pig-ugly product crippled by laughable pop-ups (with scenery winking into existence about 30 feet away) and a framerate that would have disgraced the original arcade Pole Position. </p> <p>Driver 2 is also a symptom of the burgeoning \"sequelitis\" of the industry. Game done well? OK, just iron out the bugs and slap a few more features in, and call it a sequel. </p> <p>Trouble is, it's usually only ever what the first game should have been. Stand up and be counted: Ready to Rumble 2, Syphon Filter 2, Medal of Honor Underground. </p> <p>The glowing exception to that rule this year was Nintendo's Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask: a game that matches the depth and variety of ideas in its illustrious predecessor (Ocarina of Time: the Best Game Ever) while being in some ways more tightly focused, and adding an intriguing Groundhog Day-style temporal scenario. Inevitably, it didn't seem quite as fresh or ground-breaking this time round, but the game is still a masterpiece. </p> <p>Also offering an impressive menu of action, but in a very different style of unreality, was Ion Storm's Deus Ex, a dark sci-fi shooter that offered the player unparalleled freedom in her approach to combat situations. Run in, all guns blazing, confuse them with a gas grenade, or pick 'em off at a distance? Train yourself in lock-picking, sniping, or explosives? Nearly anything you could think of would work. Deus Ex wore its influences very heavily on its sleeve - hello, The Matrix; hello, Half-Life - and if it wasn't a particularly original game, it was a masterful compendium of well-executed ideas. </p> <p>Real conceptual originality was, as always, thin on the ground. The Sims (PC) was an amusing if limited \"people simulator\" in which little artificially intelligent denizens of chintzy households relied upon you for the success or otherwise of their love lives and their careers. The one spark of creativity in an otherwise terminally dull year for PlayStation, meanwhile, was Sony's own budget oddity Vib Ribbon, which dusted off black-and-white vector graphics (ah, Asteroids_) and had you controlling a cartoon rabbit who had to negotiate obstacles in time to a joyfully eccentric Japanese soundtrack, in order to avoid turning into a worm. </p> <p>For sheer aesthetic origi nality, on the other hand, the best game of the year was undoubtedly Sega's Jet Set Radio. Its \"cel-shaded\" graphics combined traditional 3D rendering with a fresh, cartoony look, and - this is the magic touch of Sega's in-house developers - the skating 'n' spraying gameplay was simple to pick up but enjoyably challenging to master. Dreamcast was also blessed with a lovely conversion of Crazy Taxi (barking arcade gameplay soaked in American alt-rock), a brace of extremely good-looking driving games (Ferrari 335 Challenge and Metropolis Street Racer), and a very fine conversion of Quake III: Arena. And even though Soul Calibur came out last year, I'm going to mention it here again, because the visual and mechanical genius of Namco's fighter remains thoroughly undimmed. </p> <p>It was also, eventually, the year of PlayStation2, although the sleek super- console almost failed to turn up to its own party owing to chip shortages. Its one early success, Timesplitters, offers a four-way console deathmatch that is unrivalled in the sheer ultraviolent joy of its speedy and fabulously smooth rocket-propelled m l\u00e9es. I'll be playing a lot of that well into the new year. </p> <p>Despite a few stand-out games, 2000 hasn't been a particularly vintage 12 months in the digital arts. In fact, almost the single most exciting videogame moment was the first glimpse of footage from Hideo Kojima's Metal Gear Solid 2 - which is still about nine months away from release. Will it live up to the hype? That's a question for the Ghost of Christmas Future. </p> <p> Steven Poole is the author of Trigger Happy: The Inner Life of Videogames (Fourth Estate, \u00a312) </p> <p><strong> My top five</strong> Steven Poole <br> <strong> 1</strong> <strong> Jet Set Radio </strong> (DC) </p> <p> <strong> 2 Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask </strong> (N64) </p> <p> <strong> 3</strong> <strong> Timesplitters </strong> (PS2) <br> <strong> 4</strong> <strong> Crazy Taxi </strong> (DC) </p> <p> <strong> 5</strong> <strong> Deus Ex </strong> (PC/Mac) </p> <p> <strong> My top five</strong>Greg Howson<br> <strong> 1 Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask </strong> (N64) </p> <p> <strong> 2 ISS Pro Evolution </strong> (PSX) </p> <p> <strong> 3 Perfect Dark </strong> (N64) </p> <p> <strong> 4 Resident Evil: Code Veronica </strong> (DC) </p> <p> <strong> 5 Metropolis Street Racer </strong> (DC) </p> <p><strong> My top five</strong> Jack Schofield <br> <strong> 1 Championship Manager Season 00/01 </strong> (PC) </p> <p> <strong> 2 The Sims </strong> (PC) </p> <p> <strong> 3 Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask </strong> (N64) </p> <p> <strong> 4 SSX Snowboarding </strong> (PS2) </p> <p> <strong> 5 Gran Turismo 2 </strong> (PSX) </p> <p><strong> My top five</strong> Andy Bodle <br> </p> <p> <strong> 1 Vib Ribbon </strong> (PSX) </p> <p> <strong> 2 Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn </strong> (PC) </p> <p> <strong> 3 Messiah </strong> (PC) </p> <p> <strong> 4 Micro Maniacs </strong> (PSX) </p> <p> <strong> 5 Shenmue </strong> (DC) </p>",

Here were the Combat Boost (a pill that slowed down time to enable you to rescue hostages with John Woo-style headshots to kidnappers), the Farsight (a weapon that could aim and shoot through walls), and the superb Laptop Gun, a rapid-fire weapon that could be deployed on walls as a friendly comrade. But the attempt to characterise the game's heroine, Joanna Dark, as a post-Lara Croft cyberbabe fell laughably flat, and the gruesomely bad cut-scenes attempted to tell an increasingly absurd and incoherent pulp sci-fi story. What was most galling was the framerate problem: the screen update slowed to a jerky crawl at higher difficulty levels, and all the time in the co-operative and counter-operative mission modes, thus rendering some interesting ideas thoroughly unplayable. Elsewhere, other developers were also asking current videogame hardware to do more than was strictly possible, and gameplay always suffered as a result. Vastly hyped for its pre-Christmas appearance, for example, was 1970s mission-driving sequel Driver 2, a pig-ugly product crippled by laughable pop-ups (with scenery winking into existence about 30 feet away) and a framerate that would have disgraced the original arcade Pole Position. Driver 2 is also a symptom of the burgeoning \"sequelitis\" of the industry. Game done well? OK, just iron out the bugs and slap a few more features in, and call it a sequel. Trouble is, it's usually only ever what the first game should have been. Stand up and be counted: Ready to Rumble 2, Syphon Filter 2, Medal of Honor Underground. The glowing exception to that rule this year was Nintendo's Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask: a game that matches the depth and variety of ideas in its illustrious predecessor (Ocarina of Time: the Best Game Ever) while being in some ways more tightly focused, and adding an intriguing Groundhog Day-style temporal scenario. Inevitably, it didn't seem quite as fresh or ground-breaking this time round, but the game is still a masterpiece. Also offering an impressive menu of action, but in a very different style of unreality, was Ion Storm's Deus Ex, a dark sci-fi shooter that offered the player unparalleled freedom in her approach to combat situations. Run in, all guns blazing, confuse them with a gas grenade, or pick 'em off at a distance? Train yourself in lock-picking, sniping, or explosives? Nearly anything you could think of would work. Deus Ex wore its influences very heavily on its sleeve - hello, The Matrix; hello, Half-Life - and if it wasn't a particularly original game, it was a masterful compendium of well-executed ideas. Real conceptual originality was, as always, thin on the ground. The Sims (PC) was an amusing if limited \"people simulator\" in which little artificially intelligent denizens of chintzy households relied upon you for the success or otherwise of their love lives and their careers. The one spark of creativity in an otherwise terminally dull year for PlayStation, meanwhile, was Sony's own budget oddity Vib Ribbon, which dusted off black-and-white vector graphics (ah, Asteroids_) and had you controlling a cartoon rabbit who had to negotiate obstacles in time to a joyfully eccentric Japanese soundtrack, in order to avoid turning into a worm. For sheer aesthetic origi nality, on the other hand, the best game of the year was undoubtedly Sega's Jet Set Radio. Its \"cel-shaded\" graphics combined traditional 3D rendering with a fresh, cartoony look, and - this is the magic touch of Sega's in-house developers - the skating 'n' spraying gameplay was simple to pick up but enjoyably challenging to master. Dreamcast was also blessed with a lovely conversion of Crazy Taxi (barking arcade gameplay soaked in American alt-rock), a brace of extremely good-looking driving games (Ferrari 335 Challenge and Metropolis Street Racer), and a very fine conversion of Quake III: Arena. And even though Soul Calibur came out last year, I'm going to mention it here again, because the visual and mechanical genius of Namco's fighter remains thoroughly undimmed. It was also, eventually, the year of PlayStation2, although the sleek super- console almost failed to turn up to its own party owing to chip shortages. Its one early success, Timesplitters, offers a four-way console deathmatch that is unrivalled in the sheer ultraviolent joy of its speedy and fabulously smooth rocket-propelled m l\u00e9es. I'll be playing a lot of that well into the new year. Despite a few stand-out games, 2000 hasn't been a particularly vintage 12 months in the digital arts. In fact, almost the single most exciting videogame moment was the first glimpse of footage from Hideo Kojima's Metal Gear Solid 2 - which is still about nine months away from release. Will it live up to the hype? That's a question for the Ghost of Christmas Future.

Our meeting had been postponed so many times that I had to ask him to remind me what the reason for it was. He told me the company he worked for was a British web start-up that felt it had not really got the credit that it perhaps deserved. </p> <p>Oh dear, I thought to myself, not another one of those. How many page impressions does your site get each month, I asked, to keep the conversation going. I thought he said 600 and I replied: \"Six hundred?\" </p> <p>\"Yes,\" he said.\"Six hundred... six hundred million.\" </p> <p>\"Six hundred million?\" I gasped. \"Hang on, that would would put you up in the global league.\" (<a href=\"http://www.Lastminute.com\" target=\"_new\">Lastminute.com</a>, forcomparison, had 38 million page impressions in October.) </p> <p>\"Yes,\" replied Caller, European commercial director, for the company in question, FortuneCity. He added that it was the 11th most popular web site in the world, according to the authoritative Media Metrix ratings for August. </p> <p>I later checked this out and confirmed that <a href=\"http://www.fortunecity.com/\" target=\"_new\">FortuneCity</a> was indeed ranked number 11 in the world, putting it at the top end of the web's Premier Division - behind the likes of Microsoft, AOL and Yahoo, but only one place behind Amazon and three places ahead of eBay, the very successful net auction house. According to Media Metrix, FortuneCity had 15.3 million unique users in August. </p> <p>Not bad for a company started less than four years ago by five people in a back room off Kensington High Street in London, close to an alleyway occupied by tramps. FortuneCity's core product is free web building space, which comes with 100MB of free storage for each user. It earns its revenue mainly from banner adverts. </p> <p>In contrast to the millions of pounds spent on promotion by the likes of Lastminute.com and Boo, it has got where it has with little advertising - and no one seems to know when an article was last written about it. They think it was about two years ago. </p> <p>Caller, who got his job in response to a tiny advertisement in Media Guardian, admits: \"To some extent we have been successful in spite of ourselves\". You can say that again. </p> <p>Peter Macnee, president and CEO, says: \"I guess we are the least known big internet company in the world. I'm proud of it. There are a lot of small, unsuccessful, internet companies that everyone knows about... In the last couple of years there have been a lot of internet companies that spent a majority of their time on public relations campaigns. They were the poster boys of the good times and now they are the poster boys of the bad times. We are better off putting our resources towards building a good business. I'm happy that we are not the poster boys of the bad times and that we are not used as an example of the death of the dot.com age.\" </p> <p>FortuneCity was started by Dan Metcalfe who, inspired by the success of the US web-building company Geocities, started a UK variant. The company enabled users to build their own web sites, including the facility to build virtual homes and cities and be part of a community with its own elected mayor. Its slogan was: FortuneCity for the people by the people. Dan and his brother Jeremy, who between them have 40% of the shares, are still active on the board even though they brought in professionals such as Macnee, to run the company. </p> <p>FortuneCity has an eerily quiet London base with pine floors and whitewashed walls at the end of a cul-de-sac in part of the BBC's former Woodstock studios in Shepherds Bush. The official headquarters have been moved to New York to be part of the pioneering US scene. </p> <p>Following an equity issue on the German (Duer) market, nearly 30% of the shares are now owned by German citizens. The biggest remaining shareholder with 12.5% is Time Warner whose own website was four places behind FortuneCity in August at number 15. </p> <p>Metcalfe fondly remembers the early days when it was a case of just trying to keep up with the growth. Every time he pressed the \"reload\" button on his computer he found that two or three more new members had registered - a growth that was soon to be measured in thousands, then millions. In the early days the company shared computer facilities with various small internet service providers and he had to drive the company's computer round to different locations in a Beetle. </p> <p>The amazing thing about FortuneCity is how has it managed to be so successful with low-key promotion. It has had no advertising at all for the past eight months since the company retrenched and cut staff in the face of the impending downturn in the capital-raising markets - yet it claims that new users have continued to register at around 4,000 a day. </p> <p>The secret is a combination of \"viral\" (as in virus) and \"guerilla\" marketing. Viral marketing is mainly passive - when the message is passed by word of mouth or by email from user to potential user. FortuneCity assists this by feeding one of its properties from another. If someone registers on the FortuneCity site they are offered a V3 domain name and they may then opt for the newsletter, thereby fuelling the organic nature of the business. </p> <p>V3, acquired by FortuneCity last year, claims to be the world's largest provider of redirect services, personalised website URLs and matching email addresses. FortuneCity also owns Hotgames, the gaming site, and Gelon, a well-regarded Wap company, though none is branded with FortuneCity's name. Gareth Williams, director of European operations, says a lot of users will be using a FortuneCity site without actually knowing it. </p> <p>Guerilla marketing is highly active. It aims to get FortuneCity's name as high as possible on the internet's search engines because they are the main way people find their way around the web. Alan Mills, known within the company as \"king of the search engines\", spends nearly all his time engaging in cat-and-mouse tactics with the software engineers employed by the likes of AltaVista, Google and AskJeeves to secure maximum exposure on the web's huge network. A dozen search engines account for 90% of the total traffic. </p> <p>He demonstrated by getting \"Free web pages\" and \"Free web page\" typed into AltaVista's search engine - and FortuneCity emerged in first or second place out of nearly 200,000 references. A similar search on Google put FortuneCity in 10th place out of 765,000 references to free web pages. Part of the strategy, he said, was to get FortuneCity's name in the titles and meta tags which appear near the top of the code behind a web page. But search engines were getting more sophisticated and often weighted sites by the number of other links pointing to your site. \"You don't know what criteria they are using, but you can work it out by trial and error. That's my job.\" </p> <p>FortuneCity has been spectacularly successful in building a global customer base. It now has almost 20m unique users (compared with 2.2m for lastminute.com, one of the UK's better known sites) and claims to be still expanding by 5% to 10% a month. It has 130 employees including 55 in Europe. </p> <p>Its market share is stronger the further away it is from the biggest western markets (partly because of its emphasis on local language sites). Its market reach in the UK (measured by the proportion of the internet population using its site a month) is 9.4% and in the US 9.9%. In Germany it is 17.4%, in France 16.8%, in Japan, 15.3%, in Canada 15.7%, in Australia, 12.4% and in Hong Kong a startling 43.2%. </p> <p>FortuneCity is one of the very few internet companies that has a leading market position in all the main world markets. It is a position that many other web companies can only dream about. </p> <p>But, as most dot.com companies know to their cost, it is one thing to attract users to your site, especially when you are offering something for nothing, but quite another to convert the user base into revenue and profits. Revenues (mainly from banner advertising) in the first nine months of 2000 increased by 90% over the previous year to $9m. But losses over the same period rose from $14.7m to $32.7m. </p> <p>The company claims to have taken corrective action. It cut staff by 40% earlier in the year when the climate changed for the worst in the capital markets, and drastically cut its spending on advertising and marketing. It has still got $26m cash in the bank from the $97m it raised when it went public and reckons that its \"burn rate\" (the rate at which it is losing money raised from investors) is down to $1.2m a month - enough, it is claimed, to see it through until 2002 when it hopes to break even. Peter Mcnee says the company was lucky, or smart enough, to raise capital early on and cut back its operations quicker than others who are now cutting back almost every day. This has left FortuneCity, he says, with enough money to \"power through\". </p> <p>Not everyone agrees. Lehman Brothers says that the 40% recovery in FortuneCity's share price on Monday last week (it happened on the day Online was visiting the company!) was \"not justified\" and is concerned that it has cut its operating expenses to a minimum and that there are very few resources for growth. Lehman adds: \"We are becoming increasingly concerned with the deteriorating revenue outlook_ We retain our Underperform rating.\" </p> <p>Macnee claims that Lehman's analyst has done little to get to know the business and says that they have given Vitiminic, which has a market capitalisation three to four times larger than FortuneCity's, a better rating despite the fact that its revenues in the third quarter were less than 10% of FortuneCity's. \"The reality,\" he says, \"is that the institutional investment community has soured on the vast majority of business-to-business and business-to-consumer businesses.\" </p> <p>Although the company is dependent on banner advertising at present, Macnee predicts that advertising in this medium will change dramatically in the next six months with access to broadband advertisers, including technologies like streaming audio and video. \"It's going to be much more like a television kind of advertising with interactive capabilities_ before you are able to see the content you are looking for, you may have to sit through a five second commercial instead of a static banner.\" </p> <p>He admits this is a bit contrary to FortuneCity's alternative culture, but adds: \"I think there is a general rain check going on out there - that the great things that the internet can deliver can't come for free.\" </p> <p>That is true, but it remains to be seen to what extent the punters agree. After all, if FortuneCity, with all its users, does not manage to generate enough revenue to cover its outgoings, what sort of message would that send out to everyone else?</p>",

But there were likely to be serious difficulties in getting planning approval for up to four units for disordered people.</p> <p>The government is considering solving the problem by building a \"modular\" special hospital with clusters of small units. Ministers do not yet have a location in mind.</p> <p>The white paper said people with personality disorders could not be detained under the Mental Health Act because their condition was considered medically untreatable.</p> <p>This legal loophole caused public outrage in the case of Michael Stone, who was diagnosed as having a severe personality disorder several years before he bludgeoned Lin Russell and her six-year-old daughter Megan to death as they walked through fields near their home in 1996.</p> <p>The white paper said there should be powers to detain people for up to 28 days if a doctor decided they had a personality disorder, with futher reviews at six-month intervals.</p> <p>Mr Milburn said: \"At present neither the law nor services are geared to cope with the risks posed by dangerous people with severe personality disorder. There has been a gap in the protection mental health laws should afford the public - a gap we will now close.\"</p> <p>The white paper included plans to ensure that mentally ill people living in the community stick to an agreed treatment plan. Those failing to take med ication could be forcibly detained and taken to hospital for treatment. \"There will be no powers for patients to be given medication forcibly except in a clinical setting,\" the paper said in an attempt to reassure mental health charities which feared that patients might be forcibly treated at home.</p> <p>The proposal followed the case of Anthony Joseph, a mentally ill man who killed a woman after refusing to take his medication.</p> <p>These extra compulsory powers will be balanced by extra safeguards for patients including a new right to independent advocacy and a statutory requirement to develop care plans. A new commission for mental health will look after the interests of people subject to care and treatment under mental health legislation.</p> <p>Mr Milburn said the reforms would build on extra investment in mental health, including \u00a3300m in the NHS plan in July and national standards making mental health a priority for health authorities.</p> <p>Cliff Prior, chief executive of the National Schizophrenia Fellowship, said: \"The white paper is an early Christmas present for everyone who believes that the time is right to end the Cinderella status of mental health.</p> <p>\"But it is a Christmas present that carries a demand for payment. There can be no buy now, pay later period when it comes to investing in mental health.\"</p> <p>The mental health charity Mind claimed a victory in getting the government to drop plans to introduce forced medical treatments in the community.</p> <p>The National Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders said the plan to detain people with personality disorders because of what they might do rather than what they had done was \"an excessive reaction to a genuine and legitimate public concern.</p> <p>\"There is a very real danger that wrong diagnoses could lead to some people being detained inappropriately while others who are dangerous may be missed or still pose a risk to the public even after treatment,\" said Graeme Sandall, its spokesman on mental health.</p> <p>Liberty, the human rights group, said it was \"seriously concerned\" by the new criteria for detaining people who had not done anything wrong.</p> <p><b>Main points</b></p> <p><b>The white paper, Reforming the Mental Health Act, proposes:</b></p> <p>\u0095 Indefinite detention of potentially dangerous people with untreatable personality disorders who had not committed a crime;</p> <p>\u0095 powers to force patients living in the community to take their agreed medication;</p> <p>\u0095 an independent tribunal to determine all longer term use of compulsory powers and a patient's right to independent advocacy;</p> <p>\u0095 new rights for victims of crime to know when someone with a mental health disorder was to be released;</p> <p>\u0095 a commission for mental health to look after people who were subject to care and treatment;</p> <p>\u0095 increases in staff and services for people with mental health problems.</p>",

But there were likely to be serious difficulties in getting planning approval for up to four units for disordered people. The government is considering solving the problem by building a \"modular\" special hospital with clusters of small units. Ministers do not yet have a location in mind. The white paper said people with personality disorders could not be detained under the Mental Health Act because their condition was considered medically untreatable. This legal loophole caused public outrage in the case of Michael Stone, who was diagnosed as having a severe personality disorder several years before he bludgeoned Lin Russell and her six-year-old daughter Megan to death as they walked through fields near their home in 1996. The white paper said there should be powers to detain people for up to 28 days if a doctor decided they had a personality disorder, with futher reviews at six-month intervals. Mr Milburn said: \"At present neither the law nor services are geared to cope with the risks posed by dangerous people with severe personality disorder. There has been a gap in the protection mental health laws should afford the public - a gap we will now close.\" The white paper included plans to ensure that mentally ill people living in the community stick to an agreed treatment plan. Those failing to take med ication could be forcibly detained and taken to hospital for treatment. \"There will be no powers for patients to be given medication forcibly except in a clinical setting,\" the paper said in an attempt to reassure mental health charities which feared that patients might be forcibly treated at home. The proposal followed the case of Anthony Joseph, a mentally ill man who killed a woman after refusing to take his medication. These extra compulsory powers will be balanced by extra safeguards for patients including a new right to independent advocacy and a statutory requirement to develop care plans. A new commission for mental health will look after the interests of people subject to care and treatment under mental health legislation. Mr Milburn said the reforms would build on extra investment in mental health, including \u00a3300m in the NHS plan in July and national standards making mental health a priority for health authorities. Cliff Prior, chief executive of the National Schizophrenia Fellowship, said: \"The white paper is an early Christmas present for everyone who believes that the time is right to end the Cinderella status of mental health. \"But it is a Christmas present that carries a demand for payment. There can be no buy now, pay later period when it comes to investing in mental health.\" The mental health charity Mind claimed a victory in getting the government to drop plans to introduce forced medical treatments in the community. The National Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders said the plan to detain people with personality disorders because of what they might do rather than what they had done was \"an excessive reaction to a genuine and legitimate public concern. \"There is a very real danger that wrong diagnoses could lead to some people being detained inappropriately while others who are dangerous may be missed or still pose a risk to the public even after treatment,\" said Graeme Sandall, its spokesman on mental health. Liberty, the human rights group, said it was \"seriously concerned\" by the new criteria for detaining people who had not done anything wrong. Main points The white paper, Reforming the Mental Health Act, proposes: \u0095 Indefinite detention of potentially dangerous people with untreatable personality disorders who had not committed a crime; \u0095 powers to force patients living in the community to take their agreed medication; \u0095 an independent tribunal to determine all longer term use of compulsory powers and a patient's right to independent advocacy; \u0095 new rights for victims of crime to know when someone with a mental health disorder was to be released; \u0095 a commission for mental health to look after people who were subject to care and treatment; \u0095 increases in staff and services for people with mental health problems.",

      "body": "<p>The chief of defence staff, Sir Charles Guthrie, yesterday provoked a storm of protest from campaigning groups - but was supported by the prime minister - for saying disabled people should not be recruited to the armed forces.</p> <p>In a wide-ranging speech to the Royal United Services Institute, reported in yesterday's Guardian, Sir Charles said that to have disabled people serving in the army, navy or air force would be \"detrimental\" to the armed forces.</p> <p>He praised defence ministers for securing an exemption for the armed forces from article 13 of the EU's directive on equal employment treatment banning discrimination on grounds of disability or age.</p> <p>Margaret Hodge, minister for the disabled, is known to have opposed the exemption.</p> <p>Yesterday, Bert Massie, the chairman of the disability rights commission, said: \"It's ridiculous to exclude disabled people from serving in the armed forces because of some outdated stereotype.\" They should be considered for non-combat roles in logistics, supplies or communications, Mr Massie suggested.</p> <p>The cerebral palsy charity, Scope, also attacked the general for overlooking the \"valuable contribution\" that the disabled could make.</p> <p>The Royal Association for Disability and Rehabilitation (Radar) called Sir Charles' comments \"inappropriate and patronising\". The Royal National Institute for the Blind said that it strongly disagreed with Sir Charles. However, Colonel Bryan Gordon-Smith, of the charity Combat Stress, said: \"From a personal perspective, I entirely endorse what he [Sir Charles] said. It's a nonsense to consider disabled people for going into combat.\"</p> <p>The armed forces minister, John Spellar, was another who rushed to Sir Charles' aid. Discrimination, he said, was \"absolutely necessary to maintain military effectiveness\".</p> <p>A spokesman for Tony Blair told reporters: \"The prime minister's view... is that the armed forces cannot be just another employer. There is no such thing as a non-combatant job.\"</p> <p>The Ministry of Defence reinforced the point. \"We do not recruit for specialist roles,\" a spokesman said. \"Everyone has to be physically fit and able to fight at the front line.\"</p> <p>In his speech on Tuesday night, Sir Charles delivered a sweeping attack on what he called a culture of \"risk aversion\". He admitted that allowing homosexuals into the armed forces had turned out to be a \"non-issue\", but made it clear that he did not believe women should fight alongside men in the front line.</p> <p>Sir Charles also said the army would not make up a shortfall of 8,000 men until 2008, three years later than the official target date.</p> <p>The ministry admitted in its annual performance report yesterday that there were \"significant shortages\" in the infantry, the Royal Artillery, the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, the Royal Signals, and among young pilots for the RAF.</p> <p>The army's trained strength stands at 100,300. Three-quarters of all recruits fail to complete their training, army sources said yesterday.</p> <p>\u0095 More than a year after the Kosovo campaign, the MoD still has not got the right combination of forces for such operations, the Commons public accounts committee said yesterday, also pointing out that the RAF had nearly run out of precision guided missiles during the conflict.</p> <p>The armed forces remained under strength, a project to equip the RAF with an all-weather strike capability was years behind schedule, and the army was still without a reliable combat radio, said the committee. It urged the MoD to act quickly, if necessary buying in \"stop-gap\" equipment.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The chief of defence staff, Sir Charles Guthrie, yesterday provoked a storm of protest from campaigning groups - but was supported by the prime minister - for saying disabled people should not be recruited to the armed forces. In a wide-ranging speech to the Royal United Services Institute, reported in yesterday's Guardian, Sir Charles said that to have disabled people serving in the army, navy or air force would be \"detrimental\" to the armed forces. He praised defence ministers for securing an exemption for the armed forces from article 13 of the EU's directive on equal employment treatment banning discrimination on grounds of disability or age. Margaret Hodge, minister for the disabled, is known to have opposed the exemption. Yesterday, Bert Massie, the chairman of the disability rights commission, said: \"It's ridiculous to exclude disabled people from serving in the armed forces because of some outdated stereotype.\" They should be considered for non-combat roles in logistics, supplies or communications, Mr Massie suggested. The cerebral palsy charity, Scope, also attacked the general for overlooking the \"valuable contribution\" that the disabled could make. The Royal Association for Disability and Rehabilitation (Radar) called Sir Charles' comments \"inappropriate and patronising\". The Royal National Institute for the Blind said that it strongly disagreed with Sir Charles. However, Colonel Bryan Gordon-Smith, of the charity Combat Stress, said: \"From a personal perspective, I entirely endorse what he [Sir Charles] said. It's a nonsense to consider disabled people for going into combat.\" The armed forces minister, John Spellar, was another who rushed to Sir Charles' aid. Discrimination, he said, was \"absolutely necessary to maintain military effectiveness\". A spokesman for Tony Blair told reporters: \"The prime minister's view... is that the armed forces cannot be just another employer. There is no such thing as a non-combatant job.\" The Ministry of Defence reinforced the point. \"We do not recruit for specialist roles,\" a spokesman said. \"Everyone has to be physically fit and able to fight at the front line.\" In his speech on Tuesday night, Sir Charles delivered a sweeping attack on what he called a culture of \"risk aversion\". He admitted that allowing homosexuals into the armed forces had turned out to be a \"non-issue\", but made it clear that he did not believe women should fight alongside men in the front line. Sir Charles also said the army would not make up a shortfall of 8,000 men until 2008, three years later than the official target date. The ministry admitted in its annual performance report yesterday that there were \"significant shortages\" in the infantry, the Royal Artillery, the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, the Royal Signals, and among young pilots for the RAF. The army's trained strength stands at 100,300. Three-quarters of all recruits fail to complete their training, army sources said yesterday. \u0095 More than a year after the Kosovo campaign, the MoD still has not got the right combination of forces for such operations, the Commons public accounts committee said yesterday, also pointing out that the RAF had nearly run out of precision guided missiles during the conflict. The armed forces remained under strength, a project to equip the RAF with an all-weather strike capability was years behind schedule, and the army was still without a reliable combat radio, said the committee. It urged the MoD to act quickly, if necessary buying in \"stop-gap\" equipment.",

Shepard and Pooh were always invited to our parties. When they could not come, they wrote a letter. And I remember very well sitting in Shepard's studio while he made the little Plasticine figures, which I am also now giving to the British Library.\" Dr Stopes-Roe has had a lifelong interest in moral philosophy, and since his retirement from Birmingham University has been vice-president of the British Humanist Association. His happy memories of such childhood frivolities will probably startle those who remember his mother, Marie Stopes, a pioneer of birth control education, whose book Married Love was regarded as scandalous in its day. The family lived in Surrey, near Shepard, the artist whose illustrations for AA Milne's text ensured the immortality of Winnie the Pooh, Christopher Robin and the Hundred Acre Wood. Shepard loved children, who were always welcome at his house. Arthur Chandler, curator of an exhibition of Shepard drawings at the Dulwich Picture Gallery in south London, discovered hundreds of adults who had cherished his drawings: every child he visited, or who came to the house, went away with one. His last known drawing, at the age of 90 in 1970, showed Eeyore and Piglet playing. The note to Harry Stopes-Roe was a typical whimsy. With Pooh sobbing it reads: \"Dear Buffkins. I am verry sory that I cant come to yr party but I am going away to the igsle of wite on Saturday 24nd I am verry verry sory. Pooh.\" \u0095 The letter and the figures will be on display until the new year.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>On Saturday night, Sue Johnston sat at a table with her Royle Family co-stars and rehearsed a state of grace for the moment when she would lose out in the best TV actress category at the British Comedy Awards. A rumour had gone round that all winners were tipped off before the ceremony in a bid to stop them drinking their way into a mortifying acceptance speech. \"Well, that's me down the pan,\" thought Johnston, who had heard nothing. \"It'll go to Victoria Wood or Kathy Burke.\"</p> <p>In the event, she won the award for her role as Barbara Royle, long-suffering wife to Ricky Tomlinson's Jim in a sitcom that holds a mirror up to the grotesqueries of British family life and has driven Johnston into the nation's consciousness. \"The life drained out of me when they called my name,\" she says. \"Luckily, I'd decided to be sensible and stay off the champagne.\"</p> <p>The role of Barbara is not for the faint-hearted actress with illusions of glamour. \"Barbara's sweet and quite thick and very endearing,\" says Johnston \"She doesn't have bad thoughts and she doesn't have any intellect. The big mystery is, she loves Jim. She actually wants to go upstairs with him for a bit of the other. You think, 'Oh Barbara, please!' But in a way I'm envious of her simplicity, the fact that she doesn't worry about the filth in the kitchen. I could never be like that.\"</p> <p>Under her executive-style bob, cut for her role as a criminal profiler in the BBC drama Waking the Dead, Johnston looks sparky and blonde and metropolitan. As Barbara Royle, she is lank-haired, droopy-eyed and, along with the rest of her family, surgically attached to a horrible brown sofa. When she ventures into her badly ventilated kitchen, she emerges looking as if she's been steamed alongside the brussel sprouts. Caroline Aherne, writer and director, routinely apologises to Johnston for driving her appearance further and further downhill as the series develops.</p> <p>\"For the Christmas episode, she said, 'Do you mind letting your hair go? Letting the grey come out? Because I want you to look really sad in this.' I said, 'Great, yeah, fine.' I look appalling, worse than anyone has ever seen me. When I watched it back, I had to cover my eyes. Caroline said to me, 'I can't believe you've no vanity.' I'm not without vanity in everyday life - I ran to put on some lipstick for the photograph just now. But that is totally different to when I'm acting. If you start worrying about what you look like, you lose the truth of a role. If that sounds a bit grand then I can't help it because that's how I work.\"</p> <p>Johnston, who is 57, learned these lessons in humility during a 20-year career in regional theatre. Her parents were against her becoming an actress. They wanted her to go to university and pursue a respectable career in her native Warrington, Cheshire. \"I had no one to talk to about acting because no one in my family did it. I had a great drama teacher called Miss Potter, who said 'You've got a gift, you should go for it.' But my father had missed the opportunity to go to university and wanted me to go. To him, the thought of me being an actress was almost equivalent to me being a whore - my dad's beloved only child. But I always knew it would happen. I knew.\"</p> <p>After winning a place at the Webber Douglas drama school at the age of 21, Johnston embarked on a career in repertory theatre. It was an environment in which actors weren't encouraged to view themselves as franchises. They weren't groomed for celebrity. They earned \u00a36 a week and were taught not to look in the mirror too much.</p> <p>\"For years I never had to think about what I looked like, because in repertory theatre, you don't have to watch yourself back. One day you'll be an old bat, the next a beautiful lead, the next a cockney maid. At drama school they always insisted we never work in front of a mirror because it would make us concentrate on the outside of the role, not the inside. Then I got a part in Brookside and suddenly I was confronted with myself. It was frightening.\"</p> <p>For eight years, Johnston played Sheila Grant, the working-class battleaxe of Brookside Close. Her screen husband, Bobby, was played by Ricky Tomlinson. \"I think soaps have become the equivalent to weekly rep,\" she says, \"because you get so much technical experience so quickly.\"</p> <p>Her mother wasn't impressed with her leap in status, however. Johnston compares her to the nanna character in the Royal Family, always ready with a blinding non-sequitor or a crippling insult. \"When I was on Brookside, my mother kept saying, 'Why do you have to dress like that?' She's never really understood how it works, my mum. She used to come and see me in plays and the first thing she'd say afterwards, was 'Well, you looked nice in that suit, why don't you dress like that when you're off the stage?'\"</p> <p>Such is the similarity between her mother and Barbara Royle's mother, that Johnston has been accused of leaking details of her family life to Caroline Aherne. \"It started with the china cups,\" she says. \"My mum and auntie always use china cups. I started keeping one for them at my house, because they used to bring one round rather than drink from what they call 'those beakers'. And of course, in the Royle Family, Nanna comes in and wants a china cup. My mum said, 'Did you tell them about that?' 'No,' I said.

      "bodyText": "On Saturday night, Sue Johnston sat at a table with her Royle Family co-stars and rehearsed a state of grace for the moment when she would lose out in the best TV actress category at the British Comedy Awards. A rumour had gone round that all winners were tipped off before the ceremony in a bid to stop them drinking their way into a mortifying acceptance speech. \"Well, that's me down the pan,\" thought Johnston, who had heard nothing. \"It'll go to Victoria Wood or Kathy Burke.\" In the event, she won the award for her role as Barbara Royle, long-suffering wife to Ricky Tomlinson's Jim in a sitcom that holds a mirror up to the grotesqueries of British family life and has driven Johnston into the nation's consciousness. \"The life drained out of me when they called my name,\" she says. \"Luckily, I'd decided to be sensible and stay off the champagne.\" The role of Barbara is not for the faint-hearted actress with illusions of glamour. \"Barbara's sweet and quite thick and very endearing,\" says Johnston \"She doesn't have bad thoughts and she doesn't have any intellect. The big mystery is, she loves Jim. She actually wants to go upstairs with him for a bit of the other. You think, 'Oh Barbara, please!' But in a way I'm envious of her simplicity, the fact that she doesn't worry about the filth in the kitchen. I could never be like that.\" Under her executive-style bob, cut for her role as a criminal profiler in the BBC drama Waking the Dead, Johnston looks sparky and blonde and metropolitan. As Barbara Royle, she is lank-haired, droopy-eyed and, along with the rest of her family, surgically attached to a horrible brown sofa. When she ventures into her badly ventilated kitchen, she emerges looking as if she's been steamed alongside the brussel sprouts. Caroline Aherne, writer and director, routinely apologises to Johnston for driving her appearance further and further downhill as the series develops. \"For the Christmas episode, she said, 'Do you mind letting your hair go? Letting the grey come out? Because I want you to look really sad in this.' I said, 'Great, yeah, fine.' I look appalling, worse than anyone has ever seen me. When I watched it back, I had to cover my eyes. Caroline said to me, 'I can't believe you've no vanity.' I'm not without vanity in everyday life - I ran to put on some lipstick for the photograph just now. But that is totally different to when I'm acting. If you start worrying about what you look like, you lose the truth of a role. If that sounds a bit grand then I can't help it because that's how I work.\" Johnston, who is 57, learned these lessons in humility during a 20-year career in regional theatre. Her parents were against her becoming an actress. They wanted her to go to university and pursue a respectable career in her native Warrington, Cheshire. \"I had no one to talk to about acting because no one in my family did it. I had a great drama teacher called Miss Potter, who said 'You've got a gift, you should go for it.' But my father had missed the opportunity to go to university and wanted me to go. To him, the thought of me being an actress was almost equivalent to me being a whore - my dad's beloved only child. But I always knew it would happen. I knew.\" After winning a place at the Webber Douglas drama school at the age of 21, Johnston embarked on a career in repertory theatre. It was an environment in which actors weren't encouraged to view themselves as franchises. They weren't groomed for celebrity. They earned \u00a36 a week and were taught not to look in the mirror too much. \"For years I never had to think about what I looked like, because in repertory theatre, you don't have to watch yourself back. One day you'll be an old bat, the next a beautiful lead, the next a cockney maid. At drama school they always insisted we never work in front of a mirror because it would make us concentrate on the outside of the role, not the inside. Then I got a part in Brookside and suddenly I was confronted with myself. It was frightening.\" For eight years, Johnston played Sheila Grant, the working-class battleaxe of Brookside Close. Her screen husband, Bobby, was played by Ricky Tomlinson. \"I think soaps have become the equivalent to weekly rep,\" she says, \"because you get so much technical experience so quickly.\" Her mother wasn't impressed with her leap in status, however. Johnston compares her to the nanna character in the Royal Family, always ready with a blinding non-sequitor or a crippling insult. \"When I was on Brookside, my mother kept saying, 'Why do you have to dress like that?' She's never really understood how it works, my mum. She used to come and see me in plays and the first thing she'd say afterwards, was 'Well, you looked nice in that suit, why don't you dress like that when you're off the stage?'\" Such is the similarity between her mother and Barbara Royle's mother, that Johnston has been accused of leaking details of her family life to Caroline Aherne. \"It started with the china cups,\" she says. \"My mum and auntie always use china cups. I started keeping one for them at my house, because they used to bring one round rather than drink from what they call 'those beakers'. And of course, in the Royle Family, Nanna comes in and wants a china cup. My mum said, 'Did you tell them about that?' 'No,' I said. But there are times when I finish working with the actress Liz Smith, ring my mother and think where does art begin and life end?\" Apart from the awards, Johnston measures the success of her character by its public response. There is something about Barbara's devotion to her slobbish family that moves people in supermarkets to come up to Johnston and congratulate her. Only yesterday, while Christmas shopping at Harrods, a liveried doorman sidled up to her and out of the corner of his mouth confided: \"We all love the Royle Family, we think it's great.\" To Johnston this is just confirmation of the show's universality - its power to evoke recognition in viewers who have nothing in common with the Royle household and yet still see something of themselves in it. Each show is meticulously rehearsed, the long pauses timed to push the audience to the limits of what's tolerable, before resuming the dialogue. \"It's one of the most disciplined things I've worked on. The words are set in stone. The long pauses were a bit frightening at first. I used to find it so funny, seeing the camera pan round and there you were sucking a mint.

      "body": "<p>At the foot of Misoko mountain, where mad, sad, gorilla-lover Dian Fossey lived out her life, stands the higher institute of agriculture and animal husbandry. Tomorrow, 10 white buses will pull away from the institute. Inside will be the class of 1994: the killer children of the Rwanda genocide. The 484 young men and two girls, who have spent the last six years locked up in prisons across the country, have been at this \"solidarity\" camp for six weeks now, preparing for a return to the real world.</p> <p>Every war has its journalists' hotel: Rwanda had the Milles Collines in Kigali, the capital. At night, dinner is served on the top-floor balcony. Below is a swimming-pool lit from the side so that the rippling water looks like clear blue marble. The gardens are planted with giant cacti and the air smells of hibiscus. Beyond the pool and the garden is Kigali - a grid of the most perfectly swept streets in Africa.</p> <p>\"Imagine,\" says my dinner companion, looking down from the restaurant balcony, \"imagine that you are sitting here and looking out over the wall at a group at a roadblock in the distance. They seem to be chatting among themselves and then you notice a woman and child to the side and the woman seems to be pleading, but nobody is paying any attention to her. The group breaks up and the men are about to move off. Then, one of them - almost as an afterthought - goes over and hacks the woman and child to pieces. That is what it was like here in 1994.\"</p> <p>During the genocide, 800,000 Rwandans, most of them Tutsis, died in just 100 days - an average of about five a minute. Some of those responsible for the killings were these children: the class of 1994. Rwandan law, unlike British law, says that children under 14 are not criminally responsible - under the law, these children should never have been locked up. As it was, in the confusion that followed the horror, they were incarcerated along with the adults.</p> <p>Faustian was 13 when he became a killer. The cow-tending son of an alcoholic father, he left home six years ago to get a job in the big town. He wanted to make money to buy himself good clothes. He sold beers and looked after cattle in the market. When he heard that there was killing in the villages, he started the long walk home in his three new shirts, wearing one on top of the other. A week later the killing began when the men in suits arrived by car from Kigali.</p> <p>Now he walks along the corridor of the animal husbandry institute wearing a purple shirt with a cardboard tag around his neck: Faustian Nikirotiman, commune of Gikongoro. Here giant lillies mark the concrete walkways between the dormitories. This afternoon there is a football match. On the sloping hill above the pitch, the genocide children pose for the school photo. In the first part of a high-risk experiment in justice, these young genocidaires of 1994 are going home. They are being released without any further punishment: there will be no trials. But they will have a key role to play as witnesses in the next stage of the justice process.</p> <p>This second stage will involve village-hall trials, called gacaca , for the 115,000 killers who were adults at the time of the genocide. The accused will be brought from prison in small groups to face the accusations of their own people. The problem is that most of the people they face will be Hutu, and many of them relatives. The Tutsis are dead or have fled.</p> <p>Here it is hoped that the class of 1994 will play a crucial role - after all, they were present during the killings. It is hoped that the boys will point out the organisers in their own villages. The Rwandan government wants to punish around 1,000 \"first category genocidaires \" - the ringleaders, the multiple killers, the rapists. So far they have identified only 40 of them.</p> <p>Faustian will be 19 when, tomorrow, he gets on the bus, carrying the past six years of his life in a rose-pink plastic bag: a pair of second-hand shorts, a green sports shirt with a frayed collar and his rosary beads.</p> <p>When he talks about what he did, it is in the deadpan voice of someone who might be describing a minor traffic accident. He only comes alive when, moving the shy hands on his lap, he talks about God's forgiveness.</p> <p>Faustian found God three years ago, and when he mentions God his reserved face sparkles. \"Before I met God, I couldn't live with the sin and crimes I had committed. I prayed for the Lord to open the prison gates and set me free, but I am still inside and God has pardoned me and set me free in my heart.\"</p> <p>He is open about being a 13-year-old and a killer. \"They said that the Tutsis had killed the president. After that some guys started killing the Tutsis and singing songs about cockroaches. I didn't kill anyone in the beginning but then we caught Casian and we brought him home and they gave me a club. The boys I was with said I should kill Casian and get his trousers.</p> <p>\"Casian asked to say his prayers before he died, so we let him. Then I hit him two times on the head with a club. He fell down very easily because he had been hiding in the bush for two weeks and he was very weak. Then somebody said that was not the best way to do it and they took my club and began hitting him on the back of the head. He took a while to die. When he was dying he asked for water and I went to one of the neighbours' houses to get water for him but they wouldn't give any water for him.\"</p> <p>A Seventh Day Adventist minister is pumping sweat and God at the teenagers to an African/Cajun beat. He cries: \"The truth will set you free.\" His audience of former child killers look either rapt or mildly amused. Faustian is overwhelmed and on his feet. \"Sinners,\" booms the minister into the microphone, tiny drops of sweat gathering on his upper lip, \"Sinners - dance for the Lord.\"</p> <p>Faustian and his fellow sinners sit on the floor, rapping and singing: \"The truth sets you free/Those who see the crimes and the criminals/Tell what you see for the truth/Only the truth can set you free.\" Boys dancing and rapping, as evangelical and exhilarated by the call to truth as they were by the call to kill.</p> <p>Rwanda's minister for justice, Jean de Dieu Mucyo, has just turned 39. He's a lawyer and the architect of the gacacas. Most of his family were murdered in 1994. \"I will not tell you how many. I am the minister for justice. I do not speak of these things.\" His buzzword is \"impunity\": the culture of impunity must stop so everyone will face trial. It's ambitious in a country where most of the lawyers and judges were murdered. It sounds great on paper, but there isn't much else in the second-floor offices of the ministry of justice.</p> <p>Even this early in the morning, the chipped marble stairways of the interior ministry have a thick coating of dust from the street. The lift is broken so the minister climbs the five flights slowly. You wonder why they don't fix the lift and then realise how ridiculous a notion that is when there isn't even enough money to pay a cleaner to mop the stairs. There are less than one hundred computers in the whole country to process the guilty, and in the minister's office visiting permits for waiting journalists are laboriously hammered out on an old typewriter. Yes, it has taken them six years to get this far, but they are ambitious.</p> <p>Faustian says nobody in his village questioned the order to kill Tutsis. There were massacres in 1959, after all, and no one had been punished. \"I didn't feel anything when I hit him,\" he says. \"Everyone was doing it and if you killed a Tutsi you were the first person to get the meat at night when they cooked a Tutsi cow.</p> <p>\"Another time the group I was with killed a woman and her daughter. It was three in the afternoon and they were sitting in their demolished house. It was near the end and we had been hunting down survivors. They just sat there before they were killed. They knew there was no point asking for mercy. I didn't hit them, the others did. I didn't see anything wrong with what I was doing.\"</p> <p>What the survivors now seem to want most is to be asked for their forgiveness. Vestine Ndikuryayo is a keeper of the dead. Most of her own family died in 1994. Afterwards she found a job as a genocide curator at Murambi Technical School, far from the village where her family were killed.</p> <p>She shows the genocide tourists around the classrooms stuffed with some of the 50,000 bodies that have been dug up. Rwandans rarely go there. The visitors book has aid workers from Ohio and Sussex, who write things such as: \"Lest we forget.\" These words fail to connect because Murambi is beyond the scope of human experience - even imagination. For 24 hours here, thousands of people were hacked to death in the green spaces between the classrooms.</p> <p>Now all that is left of mothers and fathers and children and lovers has been reduced to a surreal mass of twisted cadavers. Their bodies were stripped by the killers, who wanted their clothes, although now the occasional glimpse of human life comes in the form of a scrap of a child's lemon-coloured party dress, a blue bra with a lace trimming, or a tuft of hair on a child's skull the size of a grapefruit.</p> <p>The skeletons lie jumbled, their mouths frozen in their last dying scream, hands raised above their heads. You notice the skeleton of a young man with no right foot - cut off so that he couldn't run away. How long does it take to die, you wonder, when your foot has been chopped off? Then you close your eyes and you imagine the sounds coming from the wounded and the dying, lying on the blood-soaked grass, bodies wrapped around their already dead children.</p> <p>Yet Vestine says she can forgive the men and children who killed her parents, her three sisters and her two brothers: \"I think I could forgive, but I would like them first to say they are sorry and ask for forgiveness.\"</p> <p>Faustian, once the killer child, asks to be excused for his lunch. He returns promptly at two in another clean shirt. \"When we were in prison, people like the intellectuals and ringleaders were telling us that we would be stupid to confess. I feel that the majority of young people here have suffered and will tell the truth when the gacacas begin,\" he says.</p>",

Beyond the pool and the garden is Kigali - a grid of the most perfectly swept streets in Africa. \"Imagine,\" says my dinner companion, looking down from the restaurant balcony, \"imagine that you are sitting here and looking out over the wall at a group at a roadblock in the distance. They seem to be chatting among themselves and then you notice a woman and child to the side and the woman seems to be pleading, but nobody is paying any attention to her. The group breaks up and the men are about to move off. Then, one of them - almost as an afterthought - goes over and hacks the woman and child to pieces. That is what it was like here in 1994.\" During the genocide, 800,000 Rwandans, most of them Tutsis, died in just 100 days - an average of about five a minute. Some of those responsible for the killings were these children: the class of 1994. Rwandan law, unlike British law, says that children under 14 are not criminally responsible - under the law, these children should never have been locked up. As it was, in the confusion that followed the horror, they were incarcerated along with the adults. Faustian was 13 when he became a killer. The cow-tending son of an alcoholic father, he left home six years ago to get a job in the big town. He wanted to make money to buy himself good clothes. He sold beers and looked after cattle in the market. When he heard that there was killing in the villages, he started the long walk home in his three new shirts, wearing one on top of the other. A week later the killing began when the men in suits arrived by car from Kigali. Now he walks along the corridor of the animal husbandry institute wearing a purple shirt with a cardboard tag around his neck: Faustian Nikirotiman, commune of Gikongoro. Here giant lillies mark the concrete walkways between the dormitories. This afternoon there is a football match. On the sloping hill above the pitch, the genocide children pose for the school photo. In the first part of a high-risk experiment in justice, these young genocidaires of 1994 are going home. They are being released without any further punishment: there will be no trials. But they will have a key role to play as witnesses in the next stage of the justice process. This second stage will involve village-hall trials, called gacaca , for the 115,000 killers who were adults at the time of the genocide. The accused will be brought from prison in small groups to face the accusations of their own people. The problem is that most of the people they face will be Hutu, and many of them relatives. The Tutsis are dead or have fled. Here it is hoped that the class of 1994 will play a crucial role - after all, they were present during the killings. It is hoped that the boys will point out the organisers in their own villages. The Rwandan government wants to punish around 1,000 \"first category genocidaires \" - the ringleaders, the multiple killers, the rapists. So far they have identified only 40 of them. Faustian will be 19 when, tomorrow, he gets on the bus, carrying the past six years of his life in a rose-pink plastic bag: a pair of second-hand shorts, a green sports shirt with a frayed collar and his rosary beads. When he talks about what he did, it is in the deadpan voice of someone who might be describing a minor traffic accident. He only comes alive when, moving the shy hands on his lap, he talks about God's forgiveness. Faustian found God three years ago, and when he mentions God his reserved face sparkles. \"Before I met God, I couldn't live with the sin and crimes I had committed. I prayed for the Lord to open the prison gates and set me free, but I am still inside and God has pardoned me and set me free in my heart.\" He is open about being a 13-year-old and a killer. \"They said that the Tutsis had killed the president. After that some guys started killing the Tutsis and singing songs about cockroaches. I didn't kill anyone in the beginning but then we caught Casian and we brought him home and they gave me a club. The boys I was with said I should kill Casian and get his trousers. \"Casian asked to say his prayers before he died, so we let him. Then I hit him two times on the head with a club. He fell down very easily because he had been hiding in the bush for two weeks and he was very weak. Then somebody said that was not the best way to do it and they took my club and began hitting him on the back of the head. He took a while to die. When he was dying he asked for water and I went to one of the neighbours' houses to get water for him but they wouldn't give any water for him.\" A Seventh Day Adventist minister is pumping sweat and God at the teenagers to an African/Cajun beat. He cries: \"The truth will set you free.\" His audience of former child killers look either rapt or mildly amused. Faustian is overwhelmed and on his feet. \"Sinners,\" booms the minister into the microphone, tiny drops of sweat gathering on his upper lip, \"Sinners - dance for the Lord.\" Faustian and his fellow sinners sit on the floor, rapping and singing: \"The truth sets you free/Those who see the crimes and the criminals/Tell what you see for the truth/Only the truth can set you free.\" Boys dancing and rapping, as evangelical and exhilarated by the call to truth as they were by the call to kill. Rwanda's minister for justice, Jean de Dieu Mucyo, has just turned 39. He's a lawyer and the architect of the gacacas. Most of his family were murdered in 1994. \"I will not tell you how many. I am the minister for justice. I do not speak of these things.\" His buzzword is \"impunity\": the culture of impunity must stop so everyone will face trial. It's ambitious in a country where most of the lawyers and judges were murdered. It sounds great on paper, but there isn't much else in the second-floor offices of the ministry of justice. Even this early in the morning, the chipped marble stairways of the interior ministry have a thick coating of dust from the street. The lift is broken so the minister climbs the five flights slowly. You wonder why they don't fix the lift and then realise how ridiculous a notion that is when there isn't even enough money to pay a cleaner to mop the stairs. There are less than one hundred computers in the whole country to process the guilty, and in the minister's office visiting permits for waiting journalists are laboriously hammered out on an old typewriter. Yes, it has taken them six years to get this far, but they are ambitious. Faustian says nobody in his village questioned the order to kill Tutsis. There were massacres in 1959, after all, and no one had been punished. \"I didn't feel anything when I hit him,\" he says. \"Everyone was doing it and if you killed a Tutsi you were the first person to get the meat at night when they cooked a Tutsi cow. \"Another time the group I was with killed a woman and her daughter. It was three in the afternoon and they were sitting in their demolished house. It was near the end and we had been hunting down survivors. They just sat there before they were killed. They knew there was no point asking for mercy. I didn't hit them, the others did. I didn't see anything wrong with what I was doing.\" What the survivors now seem to want most is to be asked for their forgiveness. Vestine Ndikuryayo is a keeper of the dead. Most of her own family died in 1994. Afterwards she found a job as a genocide curator at Murambi Technical School, far from the village where her family were killed. She shows the genocide tourists around the classrooms stuffed with some of the 50,000 bodies that have been dug up. Rwandans rarely go there. The visitors book has aid workers from Ohio and Sussex, who write things such as: \"Lest we forget.\" These words fail to connect because Murambi is beyond the scope of human experience - even imagination. For 24 hours here, thousands of people were hacked to death in the green spaces between the classrooms. Now all that is left of mothers and fathers and children and lovers has been reduced to a surreal mass of twisted cadavers. Their bodies were stripped by the killers, who wanted their clothes, although now the occasional glimpse of human life comes in the form of a scrap of a child's lemon-coloured party dress, a blue bra with a lace trimming, or a tuft of hair on a child's skull the size of a grapefruit. The skeletons lie jumbled, their mouths frozen in their last dying scream, hands raised above their heads. You notice the skeleton of a young man with no right foot - cut off so that he couldn't run away. How long does it take to die, you wonder, when your foot has been chopped off? Then you close your eyes and you imagine the sounds coming from the wounded and the dying, lying on the blood-soaked grass, bodies wrapped around their already dead children. Yet Vestine says she can forgive the men and children who killed her parents, her three sisters and her two brothers: \"I think I could forgive, but I would like them first to say they are sorry and ask for forgiveness.\" Faustian, once the killer child, asks to be excused for his lunch. He returns promptly at two in another clean shirt. \"When we were in prison, people like the intellectuals and ringleaders were telling us that we would be stupid to confess. I feel that the majority of young people here have suffered and will tell the truth when the gacacas begin,\" he says.",

      "bodyText": "A separatist leader has warned that civil war could break out in Indonesia's violence-racked province of Aceh, after nine people were killed in a rash of shootings. The killing of seven villagers, one police officer and a rebel fighter in three separate incidents came within hours of a brief visit to the region by President Abdurrahman Wahid on Tuesday. Police said the officer was gunned down by rebels in eastern Aceh and the rebel was shot later in the same area. Each side blamed the other for the villagers' deaths. \"There will be war. It will get much worse,\" Zaini Abdullah said in a telephone interview from Stockholm, where he and other rebel leaders live in exile. Mr Abdullah said the violence would escalate if a fragile six-month ceasefire that expires on January 15 is not renewed. But the Indonesian defence minister, Mohammad Mahfud, yesterday all but ruled out this possibility. The visit to the region by President Wahid failed to achieve any semblance of a peace breakthrough between the separatists and the government. With no sign of the ceasefire being extended, analysts are predicting the next 12 months will be much more violent than the past year, which has seen more than 800 people killed. At least 27 people have died in the last week alone. Under heavy guard and wearing a bulletproof vest under his shirt, Mr Wahid tried to demonstrate his commitment to ending the conflict in a 30-minute speech in the Grand Mosque in the provincial capital, Banda Aceh. But apart from government officials and some religious leaders, few people were there to hear him admit to making mistakes in his handling of the crisis and urge the security forces to treat the Acehnese \"like brothers not enemies\". He also offered greater autonomy for the staunchly Islamic province that has been a separatist hotbed since 1976, when the Free Aceh Movement (GAM) was formed after decades of broken promises of self-rule by Jakarta. \"We have all made mistakes, including myself as president,\" Mr Wahid said. \"I let this happen.

Among the most recent atrocities blamed on the military are the murders of three local members of a Danish-funded group helping victims of torture. Ten GAM representatives were invited to attend the speech and meet the president but they boycotted the visit, saying it was irrelevant. \"This is for his benefit only.

      "body": "<p>Languishing in exile, a self-proclaimed target of political persecution, Boris Berezovsky has developed a sudden fascination with the victims of Russian oppression.</p> <p>This week the multi-millionaire announced that he was donating $25m (\u00a317m) to establish a foundation for the casualties of Russian authoritarianism. The International Foundation for Civil Liberties will support the abused and the vulnerable in society - prisoners, national minorities and, a press release reads, business people.</p> <p>Claiming to be a martyr to an \"utterly corrupt\" legal system, Mr Berezovsky said his fund would donate money to a centre for judicial reform in Moscow. It would also focus on the oppression of people (like him) who work in the media and believe that they have been targeted as a result of their activity.</p> <p>The irony of Mr Berezovsky's campaign to transform himself from a cynically ruthless businessman and Kremlin godfather into a champion of civil freedoms and legal justice in Russia has not gone unnoticed. While most Russians welcome the creation of a human rights body, there has been much eyebrow raising about the suitability of its founder - the most notorious of Russia's oligarchs, who grabbed his fortune by privatising state assets in the murky legal climate of the 1990s.</p> <p>\"We are delighted that a Russian-funded organisation has been set up, but there is concern that the director may hope to use the foundation to resolve some personal issues,\" Elena Zhimkova, acting director of Moscow's Memorial human rights group, said.</p> <p>The almost bankrupt Andrei Sakharov foundation in Moscow has already received $3m from the tycoon - a gift which the Soviet dissident's widow accepted with ambivalence.</p> <p>Sanguine in the knowledge that most of the Russian population loathes him for his political intrigues and for the money he made from state oil, aluminium, television and airline businesses, Mr Berezovsky professes to be immune to public cynicism about his motives. \"I just hope to help people,\" he said.</p> <p><b>Interpol</b><br></p> <p>He may feel he could do with a little bit of this help himself. He is wanted for questioning in an investigation into whether senior executives of the national airline Aeroflot funnelled $970m into private Swiss companies. He fled Russia in November, claiming that the case was politically motivated. He believes that if he returns, he risks the same treatment meted out to media mogul Vladimir Gusinsky, in detention in Spain on fraud charges on an Interpol arrest warrant from Russia.</p> <p>Mr Gusinsky owns a network of media companies, including Russia's main independent television channel, NTV. Yesterday one of his senior executives claimed in Spain that Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, plans to close down NTV in the new year.</p> <p>\"I will not return to Russia to explain myself in a purely political affair,\" Mr Berezovsky said.</p> <p>Speaking by telephone from an undisclosed location in America), he comes across as a man whose latest venture is just one of many attempts to wrest back some of the influence he wielded under Boris Yeltsin's rule. He announced on Monday that he had begun negotiations with Chechen rebels, trying to help end the war in the separatist region.</p> <p>His decision to champion the cause of Russia's underdogs came, he said, as a result of profound disaffection with the current regime. Mr Putin, he said with vitriol, was trampling on the country's rights.</p> <p><b>Hitler</b><br></p> <p>\"We can't rely on our president to be a reformer - we've got a president who is trying to turn the country backwards. We have to rely on ourselves. If we organise ourselves we can begin to build a democratic state and liberal society,\" he said. \"Putin's regime is becoming like the Germany which Hitler built - we're seeing a return of a dictatorship of the state, using nationalist motifs as a base. It isn't simply a question of anti-semitism, but a negative attitude towards all ethnic groups, under a flag of Great Russia, or Russia for Russians.\"</p> <p>Now one of Mr Putin's most strident critics, Mr Berezovsky bears much responsibility for propelling the president to power. Exactly a year ago, his funding of the pro-Kremlin, pro-Putin Unity party cleared the way for Mr Putin to take the presidency, while the main state television channel ORT, which he controls, spewed out enthusiastic Putin propganda. His current venom is that of a Dr Frankenstein, horrified by the insolent independence of his own creation.</p> <p>\"I never counted precisely how much [I donated], but it came to millions of dollars,\" he said. \"But Putin deceived me and the millions of people who voted for him in the election. He promised to support the course of reforms, and instead he has stopped them and reversed them.\"</p> <p>It is debatable whether the tycoon really abandoned the Kremlin on a point of principle, or whether Mr Putin wanted a crowd-pleasing sacrifice of the government's Rasputin. From Mr Putin's point of view, the very public split with Mr Berezovsky conveniently distracts attention from the fact that other pro-Kremlin oligarchs remain in favour. Mr Berezovsky's former business partner, Roman Abramovich, is set on Sunday to be elected governor of gold-rich Chukotka.</p> <p>Mr Berezovsky strongly criticises the president's stance on Chechnya, the rebuilding of government structures in Russia to concentrate power in the Kremlin and the crackdown on press freedoms. But his current favourite theme is the corruption of the Russian prosecution service which is pursuing both him and the Media Most head, Mr Gusinsky.</p> <p>Mr Berezovsky said: \"Europe and the United States should take note of what is happening in Russia. When the Russian prosecutor said [he] has all the material necessary to imprison Gusinsky, the Spanish prosecutors took this on faith - not understanding that the Russian prosecution service is utterly corrupt and under the influence of presidential structures which are using democratic institutions to realise totalitarian aims.\"</p> <p>As Swiss prosecutors continue their investigation, Mr Berezovsky admitted that some of the $25m donation for his fund came from the contested Aeroflot funds - money which he accused Mr Putin of taking for his presidential campaign.</p> <p>\"I have never hidden the fact that the Swiss companies that worked with Aeroflot were profitable, and that part of the money which those companies earned came to me. I openly declared that,\" he said. \"I've been in business since 1989. I made a lot of money because, unlike most people, I slept only three or four hours every night and spent the rest of the time working. I earned this money absolutely honestly. My conscience is clear.\"</p> <p><b>Man with knack for figures</b><br></p> <p>Boris Berezovsky, 54, transformed himself from an impoverished Soviet mathematician to a supremely successful entrepreneur as the Soviet Union collapsed. Later he used his charm and shrewd judgment to secure himself a controlling position in Boris Yeltsin's government.</p> <p>His commercial career began by importing computer software from the west, but he began to earn serious money with the establishment at the end of the 1980s of the Logovaz car dealership, which allowed him to sell off Russian-made cars at a profit.</p> <p>His business success is a result of his versatility, and the ease with which he obtained and developed serious stakes in banking, oil, aluminium and media, as well as in the state airline Aeroflot. In 1997, Forbes magazine named him the ninth most powerful entrepreneur in the world and his fortune was rated at $3bn.</p> <p>In 1994 he took control of 49% of the state television channel ORT, and makes no secret of the role he played in the 1996 presidential election, when he and a group of influential business figures used their powers to cripple the communists and rescue Mr Yeltsin from defeat. He forged a strong friendship with Mr Yeltsin's daughter, Tatyana Dyachenko, and won himself a key role in Kremlin decision-making.</p> <p><b>Ferocious</b><br></p> <p>His control of ORT proved useful again in last year's parliamentary elections, when a ferocious slur campaign played out on the channel's news programmes effectively eliminated two of Vladimir Putin's key rivals for the presidential election in March. Mr Berezovsky won a seat in the state duma later, obtaining theoretical immunity from prosecution.</p> <p>But despite funding Mr Putin's campaign, his central role in Russian politics began to disintegrate soon after the election, as the new president launched a selective campaign against the oligarchs who had flourished under Mr Yeltsin. Mr Berezovsky resigned from his seat in the duma in July, in protest at what he saw as \"authoritarian trends\" within Mr Putin's government.</p> <p>Mr Berezovsky refuses to return to Russia to face prosecutors because he fears becoming a \"political prisoner\".</p>",

He is wanted for questioning in an investigation into whether senior executives of the national airline Aeroflot funnelled $970m into private Swiss companies. He fled Russia in November, claiming that the case was politically motivated. He believes that if he returns, he risks the same treatment meted out to media mogul Vladimir Gusinsky, in detention in Spain on fraud charges on an Interpol arrest warrant from Russia. Mr Gusinsky owns a network of media companies, including Russia's main independent television channel, NTV. Yesterday one of his senior executives claimed in Spain that Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, plans to close down NTV in the new year. \"I will not return to Russia to explain myself in a purely political affair,\" Mr Berezovsky said. Speaking by telephone from an undisclosed location in America), he comes across as a man whose latest venture is just one of many attempts to wrest back some of the influence he wielded under Boris Yeltsin's rule. He announced on Monday that he had begun negotiations with Chechen rebels, trying to help end the war in the separatist region. His decision to champion the cause of Russia's underdogs came, he said, as a result of profound disaffection with the current regime. Mr Putin, he said with vitriol, was trampling on the country's rights. Hitler \"We can't rely on our president to be a reformer - we've got a president who is trying to turn the country backwards. We have to rely on ourselves. If we organise ourselves we can begin to build a democratic state and liberal society,\" he said. \"Putin's regime is becoming like the Germany which Hitler built - we're seeing a return of a dictatorship of the state, using nationalist motifs as a base. It isn't simply a question of anti-semitism, but a negative attitude towards all ethnic groups, under a flag of Great Russia, or Russia for Russians.\" Now one of Mr Putin's most strident critics, Mr Berezovsky bears much responsibility for propelling the president to power. Exactly a year ago, his funding of the pro-Kremlin, pro-Putin Unity party cleared the way for Mr Putin to take the presidency, while the main state television channel ORT, which he controls, spewed out enthusiastic Putin propganda. His current venom is that of a Dr Frankenstein, horrified by the insolent independence of his own creation. \"I never counted precisely how much [I donated], but it came to millions of dollars,\" he said. \"But Putin deceived me and the millions of people who voted for him in the election. He promised to support the course of reforms, and instead he has stopped them and reversed them.\" It is debatable whether the tycoon really abandoned the Kremlin on a point of principle, or whether Mr Putin wanted a crowd-pleasing sacrifice of the government's Rasputin. From Mr Putin's point of view, the very public split with Mr Berezovsky conveniently distracts attention from the fact that other pro-Kremlin oligarchs remain in favour. Mr Berezovsky's former business partner, Roman Abramovich, is set on Sunday to be elected governor of gold-rich Chukotka. Mr Berezovsky strongly criticises the president's stance on Chechnya, the rebuilding of government structures in Russia to concentrate power in the Kremlin and the crackdown on press freedoms. But his current favourite theme is the corruption of the Russian prosecution service which is pursuing both him and the Media Most head, Mr Gusinsky. Mr Berezovsky said: \"Europe and the United States should take note of what is happening in Russia. When the Russian prosecutor said [he] has all the material necessary to imprison Gusinsky, the Spanish prosecutors took this on faith - not understanding that the Russian prosecution service is utterly corrupt and under the influence of presidential structures which are using democratic institutions to realise totalitarian aims.\" As Swiss prosecutors continue their investigation, Mr Berezovsky admitted that some of the $25m donation for his fund came from the contested Aeroflot funds - money which he accused Mr Putin of taking for his presidential campaign. \"I have never hidden the fact that the Swiss companies that worked with Aeroflot were profitable, and that part of the money which those companies earned came to me. I openly declared that,\" he said. \"I've been in business since 1989. I made a lot of money because, unlike most people, I slept only three or four hours every night and spent the rest of the time working. I earned this money absolutely honestly. My conscience is clear.\" Man with knack for figures Boris Berezovsky, 54, transformed himself from an impoverished Soviet mathematician to a supremely successful entrepreneur as the Soviet Union collapsed. Later he used his charm and shrewd judgment to secure himself a controlling position in Boris Yeltsin's government. His commercial career began by importing computer software from the west, but he began to earn serious money with the establishment at the end of the 1980s of the Logovaz car dealership, which allowed him to sell off Russian-made cars at a profit. His business success is a result of his versatility, and the ease with which he obtained and developed serious stakes in banking, oil, aluminium and media, as well as in the state airline Aeroflot. In 1997, Forbes magazine named him the ninth most powerful entrepreneur in the world and his fortune was rated at $3bn. In 1994 he took control of 49% of the state television channel ORT, and makes no secret of the role he played in the 1996 presidential election, when he and a group of influential business figures used their powers to cripple the communists and rescue Mr Yeltsin from defeat. He forged a strong friendship with Mr Yeltsin's daughter, Tatyana Dyachenko, and won himself a key role in Kremlin decision-making. Ferocious His control of ORT proved useful again in last year's parliamentary elections, when a ferocious slur campaign played out on the channel's news programmes effectively eliminated two of Vladimir Putin's key rivals for the presidential election in March. Mr Berezovsky won a seat in the state duma later, obtaining theoretical immunity from prosecution. But despite funding Mr Putin's campaign, his central role in Russian politics began to disintegrate soon after the election, as the new president launched a selective campaign against the oligarchs who had flourished under Mr Yeltsin. Mr Berezovsky resigned from his seat in the duma in July, in protest at what he saw as \"authoritarian trends\" within Mr Putin's government. Mr Berezovsky refuses to return to Russia to face prosecutors because he fears becoming a \"political prisoner\".",

December 20). Why not let them both run a lottery and then we'll see just who runs it efficiently and whether \"the people\" really do want a profit-free lottery - or what really matters is the payout? Surely the country's best known capitalist would welcome the challenge? After all, his railway company has done so well. <br><b>P Robinson</b> <br>Waterlooville, Hants</p> <p>\u0095 You report that \"the [lottery] commission returned repeatedly to the suggestion that it was more risky to appoint a new operator\". Oddly enough, there was no such risk aversion when Govia was recently given the Connex South Central rail franchise, given: a) Connex's performance figures were better than those of the Govia-owned Thameslink; b) the Connex bid was the more adventurous; and c) Connex's safety record is considerably better than Govia's. <br><b>AK Daniell</b> <br>Brighton</p> <p>\u0095 The decision to renew Camelot's licence is incomprehensible - especially as earlier this year the commission admitted that the People's Lottery would generate far more money for good causes. The public have a right to know exactly on what grounds the commission based its decision. One of the biggest problems in Britain is that too many decisions are made by small cliques of well-connected individuals behind closed doors. And most of the time we meekly accept their decisions. It is to be hoped that not only Mr Branson, but the people of this country will not allow this farcical decision to go unchallenged <br><b>Robert Readman</b> <br>Boscombe, Dorset</p> <p>\u0095 The lottery commissioners were unanimously in favour of a continuing bid by the People's Lottery and the government had pledged a non-profit lottery. The chair was replaced by a Thatcherite civil servant and the decision is suddenly reversed, even though nothing in the bids had altered.</p> <p>Sounds suspicious to me. <br><b>Mike Homfray</b> <br>Liverpool</p> <p>\u0095 Thankfully one person does emerge with credit from this sorry affair. I am a friend of resigning commissioner Hilary Blume and may be biased. But it is worth pointing out that she has founded and runs a successful trust which earns millions of pounds for voluntary bodies. At least those of us at the hard end can thank Hilary Blume for acting with integrity and courage. <br><b>Bob Holman</b> <br>Glasgow <br>bob@holman24.fsnet.co.uk</p> <p>\u0095 So awarding the lottery contract has turned out to be a bit of a, well, lottery.

December 20). Why not let them both run a lottery and then we'll see just who runs it efficiently and whether \"the people\" really do want a profit-free lottery - or what really matters is the payout? Surely the country's best known capitalist would welcome the challenge? After all, his railway company has done so well. P Robinson Waterlooville, Hants \u0095 You report that \"the [lottery] commission returned repeatedly to the suggestion that it was more risky to appoint a new operator\". Oddly enough, there was no such risk aversion when Govia was recently given the Connex South Central rail franchise, given: a) Connex's performance figures were better than those of the Govia-owned Thameslink; b) the Connex bid was the more adventurous; and c) Connex's safety record is considerably better than Govia's. AK Daniell Brighton \u0095 The decision to renew Camelot's licence is incomprehensible - especially as earlier this year the commission admitted that the People's Lottery would generate far more money for good causes. The public have a right to know exactly on what grounds the commission based its decision. One of the biggest problems in Britain is that too many decisions are made by small cliques of well-connected individuals behind closed doors. And most of the time we meekly accept their decisions. It is to be hoped that not only Mr Branson, but the people of this country will not allow this farcical decision to go unchallenged Robert Readman Boscombe, Dorset \u0095 The lottery commissioners were unanimously in favour of a continuing bid by the People's Lottery and the government had pledged a non-profit lottery. The chair was replaced by a Thatcherite civil servant and the decision is suddenly reversed, even though nothing in the bids had altered. Sounds suspicious to me. Mike Homfray Liverpool \u0095 Thankfully one person does emerge with credit from this sorry affair. I am a friend of resigning commissioner Hilary Blume and may be biased. But it is worth pointing out that she has founded and runs a successful trust which earns millions of pounds for voluntary bodies. At least those of us at the hard end can thank Hilary Blume for acting with integrity and courage. Bob Holman Glasgow bob@holman24.fsnet.co.uk \u0095 So awarding the lottery contract has turned out to be a bit of a, well, lottery. Isn't postmodernism great? Andy Clark Whitley Bay, Tyne and Wear \u0095 Perhaps Lord Burns has spent the last four months on Virgin Trains? Ann Black Oxford",

In the past he often seemed like a crazy kid pushing himself to the limits, even if it meant vandalising the show around him. Now there's something automatic, even detached, about his virtuosity.

This proved a liability for Durante, who appeared brittle with nerves. She can be an intensely dramatic dancer with a fine-spun lyricism but as the Sugar Plum Fairy she was barely able to sustain a smile and her jumpy, awkward phrasing seemed deaf to the music. </p> <p>By far the most satisfying performance came from ENB's own Alice Crawford as Clara.

In the front stalls we all felt quite sorry for Smaug the dragon, whose only crime seems to be a penchant for theft and exceptionally bad breath. Thorin Oakenshield behaves just as despicably in refusing to share his sweets... sorry, I mean treasure. </p> <p>Of course, that's why the story needs Gandalf as a God substitute, wandering around like a patient kindergarten teacher restoring order and calming down all the little boys - sorry dwarves - who are rushing around trying to bash each other.

But the charm of Mr Baggins himself is never made evident, and when your dwarves are leather-clad and seem six-foot tall, and the elves are also strapping great fellows, you begin to realise what a testosterone-fuelled story this is. It is not even a sympathetic one: except for the odd skirmish with a troll and the ghoulish Gollum (Clive Kneller, very good my precious), this is by no means a conflict between good and evil. In the front stalls we all felt quite sorry for Smaug the dragon, whose only crime seems to be a penchant for theft and exceptionally bad breath. Thorin Oakenshield behaves just as despicably in refusing to share his sweets... sorry, I mean treasure. Of course, that's why the story needs Gandalf as a God substitute, wandering around like a patient kindergarten teacher restoring order and calming down all the little boys - sorry dwarves - who are rushing around trying to bash each other. At the end everyone gets slapped on the wrists by Gandalf and has another little dance. By trying to turn Tolkien's little story into a big theatre spectacular, this production just makes it - and itself - look silly. \u0095 Until January 13. Box office: 020-7494 5040. Then tours until summer.",

Mr Headdon is unaffected by yesterday's moves, as is the only other executive director, head of investment David Thomas. </p> <p>An Equitable spokesman said the changes came as a result of \"listening to what policyholders have said\". Those directors leaving in addition to Mr Sclater and Ms Page include Peter Davis, former director general of the National Lottery, and vice-president Peter Sedgwick, deputy chairman of Schroders. None of the directors will receive pay-offs. </p> <p>Equitable, the world's oldest mutual life insurer, closed its doors to new business two weeks ago and warned existing policyholders that they will face lower investment returns in future after it lost a \u00a31.5bn legal battle in July involving so-called guaranteed annuities, sold as part of pension plans until 1988. </p> <p>The company opened the way for applications for the vacant posts from policyholder representatives when it said it was \"seeking new directors...who reflect the concerns of members\". </p> <p>The new appointments will need to be made by the spring to give time for the directors to be in place before the society's annual meeting in May. </p> <p>Responding to the announcement, Equitable policyholder David Hyman, 70, said: \"They probably should have resigned en masse after the [July] verdict.\" </p> <p>Giles Radice, chairman of the Commons Treasury select committee, said he would be recommending that the committee holds hearings on the Equitable issue. </p> <p>The move came 24 hours after the government said the financial services authority would be investigating its handling of the debacle since it took over responsibility for policing insurers in January 1999. </p> <p>That announcement was criticised by policyholders and some MPs, who said a wider investigation was needed. </p> <p>\"It is right [the FSA] should look into it...but it probably needs to go wider than that,\" said Mr Radice. The committee would probably want to produce a report containing its findings, he added.</p>",

Yesterday's announcement came as it emerged that the company's directors, City regulators and others who have played a role in the crisis look set to go before a parliamentary committee of MPs. In a statement the company said the directors had decided the board should be \"restructured,\" and the eight current non-executive directors, including John Sclater, the president, would all step down once suitable replacements had been found. Their departures follow the resignation on December 8 of Alan Nash, Equitable's chief executive, who was replaced by Chris Headdon, the former finance director. Mr Headdon is unaffected by yesterday's moves, as is the only other executive director, head of investment David Thomas. An Equitable spokesman said the changes came as a result of \"listening to what policyholders have said\". Those directors leaving in addition to Mr Sclater and Ms Page include Peter Davis, former director general of the National Lottery, and vice-president Peter Sedgwick, deputy chairman of Schroders. None of the directors will receive pay-offs. Equitable, the world's oldest mutual life insurer, closed its doors to new business two weeks ago and warned existing policyholders that they will face lower investment returns in future after it lost a \u00a31.5bn legal battle in July involving so-called guaranteed annuities, sold as part of pension plans until 1988. The company opened the way for applications for the vacant posts from policyholder representatives when it said it was \"seeking new directors...who reflect the concerns of members\". The new appointments will need to be made by the spring to give time for the directors to be in place before the society's annual meeting in May. Responding to the announcement, Equitable policyholder David Hyman, 70, said: \"They probably should have resigned en masse after the [July] verdict.\" Giles Radice, chairman of the Commons Treasury select committee, said he would be recommending that the committee holds hearings on the Equitable issue. The move came 24 hours after the government said the financial services authority would be investigating its handling of the debacle since it took over responsibility for policing insurers in January 1999. That announcement was criticised by policyholders and some MPs, who said a wider investigation was needed. \"It is right [the FSA] should look into it...but it probably needs to go wider than that,\" said Mr Radice. The committee would probably want to produce a report containing its findings, he added.",
