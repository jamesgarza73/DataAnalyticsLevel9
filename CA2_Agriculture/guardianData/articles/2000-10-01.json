This concert, given by the viol consort Fretwork, included three such works. Yet, in The Hidden Face, Fretwork seemed an underused resource.

It will cheer you up no end. </p> <p> The first thing you see is not a painting but a spotlit quotation from Gustave Courbet: \"The sea gives me the same emotions as love.\" Swivel your eyes to the right and there is a canvas in which Monsieur Courbet is depicted dwarfed by the sea, black-suited against a sweep of beach. He has just raised his hat exultantly and his beard points out to the horizon. Everything else on the canvas is a vortex that draws your eye to the point where the darkening green of the sea touches fluffy white clouds. </p> <p>In the next room is another quotation. \"They all come here,\" wrote art critic Louis Vauxcelles in 1905 in the manner of a bored Midi hotelier, \"like a band of migratory birds.\" And they did too. There's Braque's l'Estaque (1906) with a sizzling forest of red tree trunks bent down by the sun. Next to it is Derain's l'Estaque (1906) with burning yellows and reds - a heat map as much as a painting. That must have been some summer in the little fishing village. It was all C\u00e9zanne's fault: he visited l'Estaque from Aix in the 1870s and painted at least 60 views over the next 20 years, one of which is on show in the Grand Palais. Cubism was born in this village and in those canvases. </p> <p>Part of the appeal of the exhibition lies in comparing the Riviera we know with the one the painters in this exhibition saw. In 1896 Th\u00e9o van Rysselberghe painted La Pointe de Saint-Pierre \u00e0 Saint Tropez, a pointillist evening of trees and calm sea. There's not a vulgar yacht in sight, not one bronzed, thong-sporting Riviera bum to spoil the view. How things have changed. </p> <p>The problem is that the exhibition is too well-adjusted. Even Van Gogh painted some tranquil beached sailboats backlit by a sky that owed much to Monet. Thank heavens, then, for Edvard Munch. His 1891 Promenade des Anglais isn't quite as consummately disturbed as The Scream, which depicted events on a promenade a few hundred miles to the north. Nonetheless, this doesn't look like a nice Nice at all. Instead, it resembles Lyme Regis, with its cold light and its shy neurotics. Everyone in the picture is not only walking away from Munch, but holding umbrellas to shield themselves, not so much from the sun, but from the painter's gaze - a belt-and-braces rejection of the artist's project. Delightfully twisted stuff. </p> <p>But this isn't the best picture in the exhibition. That title goes to Matisse's Porte Fen tre \u00e0 Collioure (1914). It comes with the obligatory spotlit quote: \"I began to use black, not as a colour of light and not as one of darkness.\" And there it is, a broad black band down the centre of the canvas, flanked by strips of blue-grey, dirty beige and hospital greens.

      "byline": "Tim Ashley",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Offenbach's Les Contes d'Hoffmann is one of opera's great conundrums. No other work has quite such an ambivalent attitude towards music. Its subject is the nature of aesthetic inspiration, but Hoffmann is a writer rather than a musician, and the work's denouement consists of the creation of verse, rather than harmony. Music throughout is an instrument of the demonic forces (real or imagined) that destroy Hoffmann as a man but make him as an artist. </p> <p>It is Olympia's singing that fools Hoffmann into believing she is a human rather than an automaton. Giulietta's languid melodies seduce him into thinking her love for him is genuine, when in fact she's a high-class hooker. Finally, music possesses and ultimately kills poor Antonia, the only woman who genuinely loves him. </p> <p>This ambivalence is reflected in the epic headiness of John Schlesinger's production, with its alternate images of seduction and revulsion, and its transformation of the three heroines into posing stars. It's now better than ever, largely thanks to a towering performance in the title role by Marcelo Alvarez - a tenor who can act as well as he sings. </p> <p>In place of the usual sedate entrance, we first meet Hoffmann as he plummets wild-eyed and drunk down a colossal flight of stairs, a pathetic figure, already broken. Alcoholic mania is soon replaced by a visionary delight in creativity, but as he unravels the fantasies he imagines to be his past, we watch the slippage that leads to psychological ruin. </p> <p>He's gauchely touching with Olympia, and flings himself among the guests at Giulietta's salon with the hesitant sexuality of a man attending his first orgy. His security with Antonia, however, is undercut by persistent, nervous swigs from a hip flask. The rot and disillusionment are already setting in. Vocally, Alvarez is superb, athletic, glorious, his only fault a tendency to stray off pitch when singing softly. </p> <p>He's genuinely unmissable, though what surrounds him isn't always even. Interest has inevitably focused on Angela Gheorgiu as the tubercular would-be diva Antonia.

      "bodyText": "Offenbach's Les Contes d'Hoffmann is one of opera's great conundrums. No other work has quite such an ambivalent attitude towards music. Its subject is the nature of aesthetic inspiration, but Hoffmann is a writer rather than a musician, and the work's denouement consists of the creation of verse, rather than harmony. Music throughout is an instrument of the demonic forces (real or imagined) that destroy Hoffmann as a man but make him as an artist. It is Olympia's singing that fools Hoffmann into believing she is a human rather than an automaton. Giulietta's languid melodies seduce him into thinking her love for him is genuine, when in fact she's a high-class hooker. Finally, music possesses and ultimately kills poor Antonia, the only woman who genuinely loves him. This ambivalence is reflected in the epic headiness of John Schlesinger's production, with its alternate images of seduction and revulsion, and its transformation of the three heroines into posing stars. It's now better than ever, largely thanks to a towering performance in the title role by Marcelo Alvarez - a tenor who can act as well as he sings. In place of the usual sedate entrance, we first meet Hoffmann as he plummets wild-eyed and drunk down a colossal flight of stairs, a pathetic figure, already broken. Alcoholic mania is soon replaced by a visionary delight in creativity, but as he unravels the fantasies he imagines to be his past, we watch the slippage that leads to psychological ruin. He's gauchely touching with Olympia, and flings himself among the guests at Giulietta's salon with the hesitant sexuality of a man attending his first orgy. His security with Antonia, however, is undercut by persistent, nervous swigs from a hip flask. The rot and disillusionment are already setting in. Vocally, Alvarez is superb, athletic, glorious, his only fault a tendency to stray off pitch when singing softly. He's genuinely unmissable, though what surrounds him isn't always even. Interest has inevitably focused on Angela Gheorgiu as the tubercular would-be diva Antonia. She proves rather better at diva-dom than consumption, but she's tremendously committed, in contrast to her rather lacklustre performances of late. This may be because the competition from the other two women is stiff. Desir\u00e9e Rancatore sails through Olympia's music with stratospheric ease and gleeful abandon. Best of the three, however, is Irini Tsirakidis's Giulietta, a feral, sexual animal with a voice that is depravity incarnate. The real problem lies in the casting of Michele Pertusi as the various incarnations of Hoffmann's demonic nemesis. He's handsome, suggesting sexual rivalry as well as metaphysical destruction, but his voice is thick and solid, not always moving easily at speed, lacking the requisite flicker of Mephistophelian irony. He's at his best as sinuous, silk-clad Dapertutto; Copp\u00e9lius's grotesque humour does not suit him at all.

      "bodyText": "William Hague unveiled plans yesterday to outflank Labour on pensions by offering a guarantee to every retired person that they would be better off under the Tories. On the eve of the Conservative conference in Bournemouth, Mr Hague pledged to roll government \"gimmicks\" into the basic state pension and to match any increases in the chancellor's last Budget before the general election. \"Everybody would be a little better off, and everybody would have dignity and choice,\" the Tory leader told BBC1's Breakfast with Frost. \"There would be more money in total going to the pensioners of this country.\" Under the Tory plans, the winter fuel payment, the Christmas bonus and free TV licences for the over-75s would be scrapped and rolled into the basic pension. Single pensioners would receive an extra \u00a35.50 a week, with an extra \u00a37 for couples. Single pensioners over 75 would receive an extra \u00a37.50, with couples over 75 getting an extra \u00a310. The Conservatives' plans would be funded by scrapping the New Deal for lone parents and by cutting the social fund, which lends money to poor families. Mr Hague's announcement was designed to tap into pensioners' anger over the 75p a week rise in the basic pension in this year's Budget. The government's poor handling of the issue led to an embarrassing defeat at the Labour conference in Brighton last week, when union leaders called on the leadership to restore the link between pensions and earnings. The Tories' pensioners' guarantee follows an attempt to woo young voters by offering them a better pension if they opt out of the basic state pension. People under 30 would be allowed to put their national insurance contributions into private investments. The Tories believe that this could double the money they would receive from the state pension. Mr Hague said: \"If we had done this 30 years ago then we would have far less pensioner poverty today. We are the only party planning for future generations.\" Labour said it was ludicrous of Mr Hague to offer a guarantee to today's pensioners before the chancellor has even announced his plans.

Which of the roles is it to be for Mr Moneybags: stage villain or saturnine hero? </p> <p>Both sides of the chancellor were on show last week as he shuttled in and out of Prague. On Monday he was the darling of the conference as he tore away the New Labour veil to reveal an Old Labour face behind. But by Wednesday, he was on the losing side in an argument with Barbara Castle - Old Labour in its pure, undiluted form. Nobody likes losing, and Brown likes losing less than most. The chancellor's face was a picture of thunderous malcontent as he stalked off the podium. </p> <p>The paradox lying behind all this is that Brown was trying to face down Mrs Castle and her union allies at a time when he has more money than he knows what to do with. Nine years of growth have had a dramatic effect on the public finances, and if Brown's plan for raising the economy's trend rate of growth to 2.75% succeeds, things can only get better. </p> <p>In March, the chancellor said he was expecting to be in the black by \u00a35bn this year; it now looks as if the surplus will turn out to be \u00a315bn at least. Any previous Labour chancellor would have killed for that sort of projected surplus after he had already spent an extra \u00a343bn over the next three years. There is money - lots of it - available for pensions, but just as with schools and hospitals, there is concern in the government's ranks that it will be too late for anybody to notice the difference before the election. </p> <p>Indeed, the dreadful realisation has suddenly dawned on Labour that it could hand over a thriving economy to the enemy - just as John Major did. But whereas Brown had a \u00a328bn deficit to mop up, Michael Portillo would have a \u00a315bn surplus to blow on tax cuts. </p> <p>That \u00a328bn deficit helps explain how the government came to find itself in a fix over pensions. Reducing the deficit was a key element in Labour's attempt to show that it was competent to manage the economy, and this meant both surreptitious increases in taxes and sticking to Ken Clarke's spending plans. </p> <p>But Clarke's plans were brutally tight and left no fat for the sort of blanket redistribution that those who had waited 18 years for a Labour government were expecting. It was not feasible for Brown to pursue a policy of fiscal conservatism without offering something to pensioners and those workers on the lowest incomes. So, the circle was squared by targeting resources on the most needy, rather than trying to spread around too thinly what little was available. This decision was a profound one, because it meant that the whole basis of Labour's approach to the welfare state would be means testing not universality. To make matters worse it was means testing by stealth, carried out under the guise of \"targeting resources\". </p> <p>Once the principle of means testing was accepted, the whole of Labour's pensions policy could be justified as simply common sense. From a technocratic point of view, there is no justification in paying both a millionaire and someone living below the poverty line \u00a35 a week when, by giving the millionaire nothing, you could give the poor person \u00a310 a week. And, it has to be said, Labour has increased spending on pensioners. </p> <p><strong> Tackle the problem</strong><br> </p> <p> But so carried away did Labour get by its own inexorable logic (and arrogance) that it failed to see some of the drawbacks of its approach. Means testing is bureaucratic, costly to administer, discourages thrift and encourages fraud. In the specific case of pensions, Mrs Castle has rightly pointed out that breaking the earnings link is tantamount to a fraud, since contributions into the national insurance fund are based on earnings, but the value of the pension is linked to prices. Finally, means testing involves all sorts of political baggage. </p> <p>Even though vast chunks of state spending - from university grants to income support - are means tested, the term still carries a real stigma, especially for pensioners. The universal principle - embodied in the welfare state through the state pension, child benefit and NHS - has a binding effect. Poor people feel they are getting something as of right and rich people get something back for their taxes, discouraging them from opting out altogether. </p> <p>It may be that times have changed so much that means testing is the only way to run a modern welfare system. Jeff Rooker, the social security minister, made a case for why times have changed in Brighton last week, saying that state earnings related pensions and the growing gulf between rich and poor made the old approach untenable. There is something in this. A universal system does work better when incomes are fairly equal, not so well when the disparities between rich and poor are wide. Labour could have chosen to tackle this problem by doing something about income inequality: instead it chose to tackle it by raising the state pension by 75p a week. </p> <p>Another solution would have been to keep faith with the universal principle by restoring the link between pensions and earnings but using progressive taxation to ensure that the increase for the rich was taxed back. The government would pay out more gross, but the net payment would be the same and the benefit would still be felt by the poor. The objection to this, presumably, is that it would be complex, though it is hard to see how it could be more complex than the web of means testing Brown has constructed. </p> <p>The chancellor assumes that everybody is as au fait with the intricacies of the minimum income guarantee or the pensioner tax credit as he is. If everybody knows what you are doing, understands what you are doing, and agrees with what you are doing, anything - even 75p a week - can be justified. But in the real world that is not the case, as Labour has only belatedly found out now that it has set off down a road from which it sees no turning back. </p> <p>Except, of course, that next year there will be. In the government's own terms, 75p a week was logical because the pension was uprated in line with last year's September inflation figure, which was 1.1%. Raising the pension by 75p meant that, in theory, it maintained its purchasing power. </p> <p>Looking at it this way shows the enormity of Labour's political error. According to the inflation rate, pensioners are on track to get between \u00a32.00 and \u00a32.50 a week on the state pension. But with billions sloshing around in the exchequer, what are the chances of a bigger increase of, say, \u00a35 a week? </p> <p>In the present climate, pretty good. The government will then be in the strange position of using the universal principle to get it out of the mess that its backdoor means testing has got it in to. From Labour's point of view, this may make little sense. They might believe that pensioners do not know what is in their own best interests. But perhaps pensioners would like to make that decision for themselves. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:larry.elliott@theguardian.com\">larry.elliott@theguardian.com</a></p>",

A flowing melody of tightly limited pitches in the piano's middle register acts as a pivot for fiercely declaimed chords at either end of the instrument's compass. As the work progresses, Saunders introduces a whole series of sounds and textures, from an insistent chiming to the dry thwack of the piano's pedals. Saunders's juxtaposition of these different ideas creates a musical world that suggests something outside its rich tapestry of sounds.

It will, I'm sure, prove a popular success. </p> <p>As in Kes, the vulnerable hero is called Billy, comes from a northern industrial town and has a brutal elder brother who scorns his hobby. Like Stepping Out, there's a star role for Julie Walters and a dancing class with only one male. But the movie is subtler, more graceful than anything suggested above. And the acting, editing, production design and photography are first-rate. </p> <p>From the opening credits, the film takes us into the mind and body of the 11-year-old Billy Elliot (Jamie Bell), as he bounces in slow motion to the strains of T. Rex's 'Cosmic Dancer', free as the air (or like electricity, as he later puts it). He maintains these rhythms as he makes breakfast in a clean but run-down terrace house. </p> <p>The year is 1984, the place a small mining town in Durham crawling with cops. Billy's elder brother (Jamie Draven) and widowed father (Gary Lewis) are on the NUM picket line; his kindly, senile grandmother (Jean Heywood) is in need of the attention no one can give her; his mother died two years before, at the age of 38. The dancing is a form of expression and a way of escape. </p> <p>Dad finds 50 pence a week for Billy to attend boxing classes at a local boys' club, which he does reluctantly, taking with him his grandfather's gloves, an obvious symbol of macho tradition. Due to the strike, the same premises are being used by a ballet class run by the blousy, good-natured, chain-smoking Mrs Wilkinson (Julie Walters). Billy stops to watch the dancing girls and is dared to join in by the teacher's precocious little daughter. He's hooked and secretly pays his 50p for ballet lessons. </p> <p>In a witty and touching montage, Daldry cuts between Billy's progress in class, his faltering attempts to learn from a book on ballet using the bathroom mirror, and his father, brother and grandmother responding to the same half-heard music. Naturally, Dad explodes when he finds out about the dancing ('Lads do football, lads do boxing, they don't do frigging ballet') and a contest ensues with Mrs Wilkinson, who has hopes of Billy winning a scholarship to the Royal Ballet School. </p> <p>The frustrated Mrs Wilkinson, the surrogate mother whose alcoholic husband has been made redundant, sees the promotion of Billy as the justification for her own life, and confronts the angry father, a similarly disillusioned person. But though the film takes her side, the movie doesn't turn Billy into a creature too good and sensitive for the dead-end, culturally impoverished world into which he's been born. </p> <p>Indeed there's an important scene where he shows a considerate, middle-class boy the same brutality he has himself endured. Nor is this, like Brassed Off or The Full Monty, a picture about turning a brave face to hard times and demonstrating the resilience of the working class. In the thrust of its narrative, and in the cross-cutting between the violent clashes on the picket lines and the dancing classes, Billy Elliot suggests that economic circumstances produce cultural changes, and that we must adapt to and, in some cases, embrace, them. The film offers the 1984-85 miners' strike as a defining moment when the values and attitudes created by industrial society lost their validity. Received notions of what constitutes masculinity need modifying and an evening spent dancing on a stage can be as demanding as a night shift at the coal face, and more spiritually rewarding. </p> <p> Billy Elliot is sympathetic to the striking miners and respectful of their solidarity, but its politics are of a transcendental kind. For Billy, dancing is a solitary rather than social activity and we're shown him rejecting the tentative, amorous advances of a girl and a young boy. The escape he seeks, first through fantasy, then through professional discipline, isn't to another place or a different class. It's into a different state of mind, into a new relationship with the living world. A marvellous early image, which is echoed near the end, sees Billy dance up a steep, ugly backstreet. Behind him, there's a cloudless sky over a blue sea on which sails a single, fairy-tale boat heading on some magical journey. </p> <p>This captures the essence of the movie and takes the sarcasm out of the description of Billy by his teacher's embittered husband - 'Durham's own Gene Kelly'. Of course the film would not have worked had not Stephen Daldry discovered in Jamie Bell a dancer of easy dexterity, capable of expressing both Billy's inwardness and his boyish innocence.</p>",

Ever since they went down, less than five years after winning the Premiership, people have been tipping the Lancashire club to go back up. </p> <p>But increasingly that looks less and less likely. The arrival of Graeme Souness was intended to add some backbone to a team of highly-paid dilettantes but, after a good start, Blackburn have faltered and yesterday they looked wildly off the pace, losing 1-0 to West Bromwich Albion. </p> <p>Of course it's still early in the season but, with the race to finish second in the division hotting up, Blackburn can hardly afford to continue throwing away points and the jury is still out on whether they have the strength to mount a serious challenge. Souness admitted as much afterwards, saying: 'It was disappointing. They deserved it because they showed a lot more aggression than we did. I have obviously got to be concerned about our away form. If you are going to do well, you have got to pick up a fair share of points away.' </p> <p>Birmingham are another club of wealthy under-achievers. Every season they tend to finish there or thereabouts, but somehow they never quite make it past the final hurdle. Trevor Francis's side have once again started well but will have their mettle tested when they take on Watford at Vicarage Road today. </p> <p>There's nothing like a change of manager to revitalise a club and since the surprise sackings of Keith Stevens and Alan McLeary, Millwall have been unable to stop scoring. Yesterday new boss Mark McGhee saw his side put four past Peterborough, although in a high-scoring day this was not the best - league leaders Walsall confirmed their class with a 5-1 victory over Notts County. </p> <p>In the Third Division Brighton beat their bogey team, Leyton Orient, 2-0 at Withdene to move into fourth place. Meanwhile Halifax, yet to win at home, stay bottom after drawing 0-0 with Shrewsbury Town.</p>",

The arrival of Graeme Souness was intended to add some backbone to a team of highly-paid dilettantes but, after a good start, Blackburn have faltered and yesterday they looked wildly off the pace, losing 1-0 to West Bromwich Albion. Of course it's still early in the season but, with the race to finish second in the division hotting up, Blackburn can hardly afford to continue throwing away points and the jury is still out on whether they have the strength to mount a serious challenge. Souness admitted as much afterwards, saying: 'It was disappointing. They deserved it because they showed a lot more aggression than we did. I have obviously got to be concerned about our away form. If you are going to do well, you have got to pick up a fair share of points away.' Birmingham are another club of wealthy under-achievers. Every season they tend to finish there or thereabouts, but somehow they never quite make it past the final hurdle. Trevor Francis's side have once again started well but will have their mettle tested when they take on Watford at Vicarage Road today. There's nothing like a change of manager to revitalise a club and since the surprise sackings of Keith Stevens and Alan McLeary, Millwall have been unable to stop scoring. Yesterday new boss Mark McGhee saw his side put four past Peterborough, although in a high-scoring day this was not the best - league leaders Walsall confirmed their class with a 5-1 victory over Notts County. In the Third Division Brighton beat their bogey team, Leyton Orient, 2-0 at Withdene to move into fourth place. Meanwhile Halifax, yet to win at home, stay bottom after drawing 0-0 with Shrewsbury Town.",

Tommy Wright, Manchester City's 37-year-old reserve keeper, shone in the absence of Nicky Weaver, ruled out with a groin injury.

After the game, his manager was full of praise. 'He's been an unfortunate victim of the meteoric rise of Nicky Weaver,' said Royle, 'but if the goalkeeper's the man of the match in a home game I'm not really going to be a happy man.' </p> <p>Twice in the first half Wright kept out goalbound efforts, leaping athletically to turn Shearer's header over the bar and then bettering even that effort when diving full-length to his left in the 25th minute to keep out a Gary Speed effort. In the second half he excelled again to tip over a curling shot from Lomana Lua-Lua. Wright's form served to inspire his opposite number, Shay Given, who blocked, stopped and scrambled at times to prevent City from scoring. </p> <p>They had several opportunities, most of which fell to Paulo Wanchope and, tellingly, almost all of which came from set-pieces. City should have scored nevertheless, and when Mark Kennedy, their impressive half-time substitute, rounded Given in the 81st minute it seemed that they would, only for the Irish winger to slip and scuff the ball wide. </p> <p>Newcastle, though, were the more inventive side and ultimately deserved the win, which halted a recent decline and left them in third place overnight. 'We had our chances, and on another day could have got a point,' said Royle. 'But that doesn't hide the fact that they were better than us on the day.' </p> <p>Kieron Dyer, whose tireless and imaginative running proved a constant menace, looked the most likely to break the deadlock, and when he was substituted in the 73rd minute, with a knee injury which may force his withdrawal from the England squad, the match seemed set to drift towards deadlock. </p> <p>But within two minutes his replacement, Nolberto Solano, had created the winning goal. Lua-Lua cut in from the right before prodding into the Peruvian's path and, with the home defence shouting in vain for offside, he found Shearer unmarked at the far post to finally end Wright's resistance. </p> <p>'He'll be relieved,' said Bobby Robson of his captain, who can enjoy a mid-season break for the first time since his career-threatening knee injury. 'I think he'll be glad that he can go back to Newcastle, have a couple of days off, play a game of golf,' said Robson. 'He's done his stint with England.

'That's good news psychologically but we know we have a long way to go,' said manager Chris Hutchings, who acknowledged his team rode a lorryload of luck. </p> <p>'At half-time we should have been 4-0 up,' gasped Redknapp. Instead it was just the one, fashioned by Frederic Kanoute and finished by Joe Cole.

In the 89th minute Igor Stimac gave away a careless free-kick. Benito Carbone chipped the ball in for Petrescu to glance home. </p> <p>'We've battered them and given away a crappy goal,' Redknapp moaned. The brunt of the manager's frustrations was borne by Trevor Sinclair, whose tactical error proved so critical. He was detailed to track Petrescu but chose to stand on the goal-line. 'If you can curl a free- kick into the top corner from 35 yards you're some player but Trevor goes on a post,' remarked Redknapp sarcastically. 'There was no reason for him to be there.

A comfortable win over a limp Derby County, who never looked like ending their sorry record of being the only team in the English professional leagues without a win and slumped to bottom of the Premiership, made it 10 points from their last four games for Villa and could have a clutch of seemingly disaffected players thinking again about needing to move to more ambitious clubs. </p> <p>Somehow John Gregory has kept Paul Merson, Gareth Southgate and Julian Joachim onside after all have talked of leaving in the past few months and all were outstanding yesterday. It may be the trio's pro fessionalism, or a desire to put themselves in the shop window, but while Gregory holds on to them, Villa's form could prove more than a false dawn. </p> <p>None is flying more than Merson, who will be doing literally just that today, having been given his manager's thanks and blessing to jet off to Florida for a week's holiday. </p> <p>The inventive Merson unlocked the game by setting up Joachim's first goal before scoring a fortuitous one himself, his 100th league goal. Then, after Alan Wright had drilled home a belter and Chris Riggott pulled one back for a belatedly stirred Derby, Joachim sealed a fair scoreline. </p> <p>'One or two players have shot themselves in the foot but we are a pretty tight bunch of blokes,' said Gregory. Merson, still seeking an extension to his contract, impressed with his 'desire and hunger', added Gregory; Southgate was 'a diamond, which is why I don't want him to go', while Joachim 'fell out with me, I didn't fall out with him'. Loved by some, loathed by others, the outspoken Villa manager does have a knack of getting players to produce. </p> <p>Joachim got his chance only because of a thigh injury to David Ginola, who was replaced in the 19th minute. Within another 10, he had tucked Merson's through-pass past Mart Poom and Villa were up and running. They soon turned midfield dominance into goals. </p> <p>Before the break, Merson emphasised the disharmony in the Derby defence when his cross drifted to the far post, with the Estonian Poom and the German Stefan Schnoor the width of the Baltic apart when it came to communication. </p> <p>Derby manager Jim Smith threw on three attacking substitutes for the second half but it backfired when Villa exploited gaps further back, Steve Stone supplying Joachim for a low cross from the right, which found Wright on the edge of the penalty area. His sweet shot saw the far corner of the net bulging. </p> <p>Riggott provided a spark for disparate Derby by heading home Craig Burley's corner but there was no fire. 'It's worrying,' were Smith's reported words afterwards: the Derby manager chose not to come to the press room. The concern will have increased at the way his defence allowed Joachim to weave along the left byline before clipping the ball home. It will be interesting to see who Gregory selects for the next match - Joachim or Ginola. </p> <p>Villa Park is currently a building site, with the old Trinity Road stand being rebuilt, though its beautiful red-brick facade is apparently being retained. It is like the team. If old heads remain and a couple of quality players are added, it could be good when it's finished.</p>",

It may be the trio's pro fessionalism, or a desire to put themselves in the shop window, but while Gregory holds on to them, Villa's form could prove more than a false dawn. None is flying more than Merson, who will be doing literally just that today, having been given his manager's thanks and blessing to jet off to Florida for a week's holiday. The inventive Merson unlocked the game by setting up Joachim's first goal before scoring a fortuitous one himself, his 100th league goal. Then, after Alan Wright had drilled home a belter and Chris Riggott pulled one back for a belatedly stirred Derby, Joachim sealed a fair scoreline. 'One or two players have shot themselves in the foot but we are a pretty tight bunch of blokes,' said Gregory. Merson, still seeking an extension to his contract, impressed with his 'desire and hunger', added Gregory; Southgate was 'a diamond, which is why I don't want him to go', while Joachim 'fell out with me, I didn't fall out with him'. Loved by some, loathed by others, the outspoken Villa manager does have a knack of getting players to produce. Joachim got his chance only because of a thigh injury to David Ginola, who was replaced in the 19th minute. Within another 10, he had tucked Merson's through-pass past Mart Poom and Villa were up and running. They soon turned midfield dominance into goals. Before the break, Merson emphasised the disharmony in the Derby defence when his cross drifted to the far post, with the Estonian Poom and the German Stefan Schnoor the width of the Baltic apart when it came to communication. Derby manager Jim Smith threw on three attacking substitutes for the second half but it backfired when Villa exploited gaps further back, Steve Stone supplying Joachim for a low cross from the right, which found Wright on the edge of the penalty area. His sweet shot saw the far corner of the net bulging. Riggott provided a spark for disparate Derby by heading home Craig Burley's corner but there was no fire. 'It's worrying,' were Smith's reported words afterwards: the Derby manager chose not to come to the press room. The concern will have increased at the way his defence allowed Joachim to weave along the left byline before clipping the ball home. It will be interesting to see who Gregory selects for the next match - Joachim or Ginola. Villa Park is currently a building site, with the old Trinity Road stand being rebuilt, though its beautiful red-brick facade is apparently being retained. It is like the team. If old heads remain and a couple of quality players are added, it could be good when it's finished.",

Latapy's through-pass, played first time, was impeccable, allowing the Finnish striker to clear Weir and leave him with only Alan Main to beat. </p> <p>In his desperation, Weir took Paatelainen from behind, an offence that seemed certain to be rewarded with a penalty. Referee Hugh Dallas, after a look at his lineman, ordered a free-kick just outside the area, a decision which was confirmed as correct by television pictures. Weir was shown the red card as he was carried off the field, having injured himself in his lunge. </p> <p>It was the second time in three weeks the defender had committed the same crime, the first against Robbie Winters of Aberdeen on 9 September. He was punished twice on this occasion when Sauzee's low, powerful free-kick with his right foot was deflected by the defensive wall to the left of Main. </p> <p>Zitelli's terrific finish just seven minutes later brought Hibs the two-goal lead which was the least they deserved and gave the Frenchman his first goal for the club since signing from Strasbourg six weeks ago. Nick Colgan's long punt was headed down by John O'Neil to Latapy, who adeptly played the ball into the path of Zitelli. </p> <p>The striker waited until the advancing, flapping Main was well out of his goal before flicking the ball, left-footed, over him from the edge of the box. </p> <p>With the game effectively over as a contest, Hibs spent much of the second half evincing a nonchalance which not only took the combative edge off their own play, but encouraged St Johnstone to believe they could yet produce an unlikely comeback. </p> <p>During this period, Nick Colgan had to be alert to complete an excellent save from a ferocious low volley from Nick Dasovic and was then relieved to watch another low drive, this time from Craig Russell, slide marginally wide of his left-hand post. </p> <p>But Latapy had yet to produce the moment of virtuosity which would bring the match another exceptional goal. The midfielder took possession from his fellow Trinidadian, substitute Lyndon Andrews, and began weaving his way through defenders until he was was just inside the area. </p> <p>From there he hit the ball with the outside of his left foot low to the left of Main, the kind of execution which would tempt even the home supporters to put their hands together. With that, another satisfying shift for Hibs was brought to a close.</p>",

Referee Hugh Dallas, after a look at his lineman, ordered a free-kick just outside the area, a decision which was confirmed as correct by television pictures. Weir was shown the red card as he was carried off the field, having injured himself in his lunge. It was the second time in three weeks the defender had committed the same crime, the first against Robbie Winters of Aberdeen on 9 September. He was punished twice on this occasion when Sauzee's low, powerful free-kick with his right foot was deflected by the defensive wall to the left of Main. Zitelli's terrific finish just seven minutes later brought Hibs the two-goal lead which was the least they deserved and gave the Frenchman his first goal for the club since signing from Strasbourg six weeks ago. Nick Colgan's long punt was headed down by John O'Neil to Latapy, who adeptly played the ball into the path of Zitelli. The striker waited until the advancing, flapping Main was well out of his goal before flicking the ball, left-footed, over him from the edge of the box. With the game effectively over as a contest, Hibs spent much of the second half evincing a nonchalance which not only took the combative edge off their own play, but encouraged St Johnstone to believe they could yet produce an unlikely comeback. During this period, Nick Colgan had to be alert to complete an excellent save from a ferocious low volley from Nick Dasovic and was then relieved to watch another low drive, this time from Craig Russell, slide marginally wide of his left-hand post. But Latapy had yet to produce the moment of virtuosity which would bring the match another exceptional goal. The midfielder took possession from his fellow Trinidadian, substitute Lyndon Andrews, and began weaving his way through defenders until he was was just inside the area. From there he hit the ball with the outside of his left foot low to the left of Main, the kind of execution which would tempt even the home supporters to put their hands together. With that, another satisfying shift for Hibs was brought to a close.",

      "body": "<p>Way back in the Seventies, when footballers had frizzy perms and dreamed of landing a contract to advertise aftershave with Henry Cooper, Germany was considered the place to go to broaden your experience if, like Kevin Keegan, you had won everything possible with Liverpool. </p> <p>Things have changed a bit over the past couple of decades. No one leaves to play in the Bundesliga any more, while the Liverpool team now contains no fewer than three members of Germany's Euro 2000 side in Dietmar Hamann, Christian Ziege and Markus Babbel. Liverpool players no longer complain of feeling sated by domestic success either - Everton's isolated FA Cup triumph of 1995 was the last occasion a Merseyside team won anything. And perhaps the biggest turnaround of all for football fans of a certain age came in Charleroi in June when England beat Germany in a competitive game for the first time since 1966, although recalling the dismal fare produced by both sides in that match, one would not care to argue that the era of English superiority will last half as long. </p> <p>The next instalment of this atavistic rivalry takes place at Wembley on Saturday, when Keegan's England don red shirts once more to summon up the spirit of '66 for the last international under the twin towers. Hamann, the first of the present trio to wear the red shirt of Liverpool, is looking forward to the game immensely. 'I didn't particularly enjoy being in the first German side to lose to England for 34 years,' he said. 'None of us did. Obviously the record was not going to last forever, but we feel there is some pride to win back. Not just against England, but because our whole Euro 2000 was so disappointing. We are now making a fresh start under Rudi V\u00f6ller, and have a couple of wins behind us. I would not say we have turned it round just yet, but we have changed a few things and the outlook is more promising. The confidence is coming back, and confidence is so important.' </p> <p>If this sounds ominous, bear in mind that you could say exactly the same things about England, and Michael Owen in particular. Keegan might have needed the bluntest of hints from Alan Shearer - 'I don't want to play any more' - to review his options in attack, but there were distinct signs in the last game in Paris that England's pace and passing could pose a few more problems for the Germans at Wembley than they managed in Charleroi. As Hamann knows only too well. 'I understand how Michael felt at being a substitute for the France game, but the manager was only being sensible and checking his other attacking options,' he said. 'England are lucky to have so many forwards fighting for a place. It's a bonus if you have Andy Cole and Kevin Phillips as well as Emile Heskey, Michael Owen and Robbie Fowler. That match was a friendly, though I am sure Michael will start the game at Wembley. England will have to pick him, he's on fire at the moment.' </p> <p>Responsible for starting the Steven Gerrard for England campaign this time last year - with his remark that such a talented midfielder would already be playing for his country were he German - Hamann confirms that Owen is one of the most respected England players in Germany, and along with David Beckham, probably the best known. 'Those two made big reputations for themselves in France 98,' he said. 'People still remember what they did in the game against Argentina. Like us, they might have had a Euro 2000 they want to forget, but everybody knows what they are capable of.' </p> <p>Hamann played in all three of Germany's games at the European Championships, and the experience is certainly one he wants to forget. 'We knew we weren't playing well right from the start,' he said. 'The draw with Romania was disappointing, we should have done better, but we were not able to put things right on the pitch.' Asked whether it was more calamitous losing 1-0 to England or 3-0 to Portugal's reserves, he smiles and shakes his head. 'The England game was the worst we played,' he said. 'The Portugal game was strange, we were all over them in the first half and could have been two goals up, but by half time we knew that we would have to score at least three goals to go through, based on the fact that England were winning 2-1. At that time we had only managed a single goal in the whole competition, so we knew we would not be able to do it. The final result tells its own story.' </p> <p>Unlike his two former Bayern Munich team-mates, now reunited at Liverpool, Hamann did not figure in Germany's victory in Euro 96, so his international experience chiefly revolves around the let-downs of 1998 and 2000. He was capped at a relatively early age and had already decided to leave the German league before the last World Cup, a victim of the notorious star syndrome at Bayern. 'I had been at Bayern since I was 16, I grew up at that club, but even when I became a regular international I was always viewed as the apprentice,' he said. 'At the age of 24 I had the feeling I could not go any further forward at Bayern. It was not the coaches' fault, I had no problem with Beckenbauer or Trapattoni, and it wasn't that I couldn't get into the team. I played regularly, but I never felt I got the attention or respect I deserved from the official side of the club, and when anything went wrong I always seemed to be the victim. I just wasn't going anywhere and I felt I needed to improve, so when an offer came in I decided to come to England.' </p> <p>That explains how, after weighing up his career options, Hamann ended up at Newcastle United. Kenny Dalglish was sacked two weeks into his first season and Ruud Gullit arrived with a batch of new players and a sheaf of off-the-wall ideas, not all of which involved Hamann. 'These things happen in football,' he shrugged, alluding to what must have been a difficult and uncertain 12 months which ended improbably and painfully with the limpest of FA Cup final defeats. 'It's funny, but all my friends told me I must not go to Newcastle, that I wouldn't like it there, but that just made me all the more determined to go. </p> <p>'I wanted to form my own impressions. The reason people told me I was making a mistake was because of the area, they said it was remote and unsophisticated, but I never had any problems on that front. I took my wife to show her, she liked it, and we were perfectly happy. I had a great year there, even if the move did not work out quite as I hoped from a football point of view.' </p> <p>Hamann is much happier with his latest move. 'This is definitely a more ambitious club,' he said. And with his current form. 'For the first time in three years I got in a proper pre-season, free from injury, and I'm feeling the benefit,' he explained. </p> <p>'I felt I had a few good games last season, but I wasn't consistent enough.' Nor has he been disappointed with English football in general. 'Standards at the top in the Bundesliga are very high, but if you look at the whole league I think the Premiership is stronger, as well as being more exciting and interesting,' he said. 'A couple of weeks ago we played against Manchester City, a newly promoted side, and they brought on George Weah for the last half hour. He scored too, as you might expect of a former World Player of the Year. That sort of thing would never happen in the Bundesliga, never in a million years. Of course in any league there are strong teams and weak teams, rich clubs and poor ones, but there's a lot of unpredictability in the Premiership. </p> <p>'You can't look at many games and be certain what is going to happen, in fact unusual things happen all the time, which makes it entertaining. Everyone feels they have a chance, unless they happen to be playing Manchester United. They are not so unpredictable ... they just win all their games.'</p>",

Hamann is much happier with his latest move. 'This is definitely a more ambitious club,' he said. And with his current form. 'For the first time in three years I got in a proper pre-season, free from injury, and I'm feeling the benefit,' he explained. 'I felt I had a few good games last season, but I wasn't consistent enough.' Nor has he been disappointed with English football in general. 'Standards at the top in the Bundesliga are very high, but if you look at the whole league I think the Premiership is stronger, as well as being more exciting and interesting,' he said. 'A couple of weeks ago we played against Manchester City, a newly promoted side, and they brought on George Weah for the last half hour. He scored too, as you might expect of a former World Player of the Year. That sort of thing would never happen in the Bundesliga, never in a million years. Of course in any league there are strong teams and weak teams, rich clubs and poor ones, but there's a lot of unpredictability in the Premiership. 'You can't look at many games and be certain what is going to happen, in fact unusual things happen all the time, which makes it entertaining. Everyone feels they have a chance, unless they happen to be playing Manchester United. They are not so unpredictable ... they just win all their games.'",

      "body": "<p>Consistently inconsistent. It's Chelsea's infuriating fickleness that really got to Claudio Ranieri in the wake of his first experience of the ups and downs of life at the Bridge. Ticking off his players in the dressing room in Zurich, he got straight to the point: 'I don't like a team who plays really well on Sunday and really badly on Thursday.' Subdued, humbled, and dumped out of Europe by the previously unheralded but now infamous might of St Gallen, his players returned to their hotel, ate quietly and slunk off to their rooms with a lot on their minds. 'A few people didn't sleep much,' admitted goalkeeper Carlo Cudicini, 'and the next morning everyone had a bad face.' </p> <p>Later, back at Heathrow there was no luxury coach to whisk these multimillion-pound underachievers back to their cars at the training ground. Just a cramped minibus more suitable for schoolboys, and they leapt out and straight on to the pitch to try to kick the errors out of their game. It was no less than they deserved, explained Cudicini. 'It's difficult to accept because it was the first round against an average team. They deserved it, they hurt us a lot on the counter attack. Now we are here to cry.' </p> <p>Ranieri cannot afford to tolerate self-pity. One week and two bizarre results into his reign, it's difficult to fathom quite where Chelsea are headed. On the day he was appointed, a season-ticket holder in the Matthew Harding stand, pondered the future and reckoned that in a year's time his club will have turned into either AC Milan or Norwich. </p> <p>Emotions at Stamford Bridge lurch between wild ambition and bitter fear of failure. Ranieri's Chelsea have been kicked in the stomach by Leicester, then they picked themselves up in fine style against Manchester United, only to be slapped around the chops by the Swiss.

      "bodyText": "Consistently inconsistent. It's Chelsea's infuriating fickleness that really got to Claudio Ranieri in the wake of his first experience of the ups and downs of life at the Bridge. Ticking off his players in the dressing room in Zurich, he got straight to the point: 'I don't like a team who plays really well on Sunday and really badly on Thursday.' Subdued, humbled, and dumped out of Europe by the previously unheralded but now infamous might of St Gallen, his players returned to their hotel, ate quietly and slunk off to their rooms with a lot on their minds. 'A few people didn't sleep much,' admitted goalkeeper Carlo Cudicini, 'and the next morning everyone had a bad face.' Later, back at Heathrow there was no luxury coach to whisk these multimillion-pound underachievers back to their cars at the training ground. Just a cramped minibus more suitable for schoolboys, and they leapt out and straight on to the pitch to try to kick the errors out of their game. It was no less than they deserved, explained Cudicini. 'It's difficult to accept because it was the first round against an average team. They deserved it, they hurt us a lot on the counter attack. Now we are here to cry.' Ranieri cannot afford to tolerate self-pity. One week and two bizarre results into his reign, it's difficult to fathom quite where Chelsea are headed. On the day he was appointed, a season-ticket holder in the Matthew Harding stand, pondered the future and reckoned that in a year's time his club will have turned into either AC Milan or Norwich. Emotions at Stamford Bridge lurch between wild ambition and bitter fear of failure. Ranieri's Chelsea have been kicked in the stomach by Leicester, then they picked themselves up in fine style against Manchester United, only to be slapped around the chops by the Swiss.

He would hardly be a choice for the future, but as Keegan himself has said on more than one occasion, if you have the ability and the experience, who is looking at birth certificates?

      "body": "<p>Sunny blue skies and snow-covered mountains may just be memories in the photograph album. It is time, however, to think about skiing again. Enthusiasts enjoyed good snow last winter, even if greedy millennium prices and a late Easter left some larger tour operators with fewer customers than they had hoped. Many smaller, independent companies did well, against the trend. </p> <p>About 770,000 Britons went skiing last year, a drop of 105,000 on the previous season. About 450,000 bought packages, 199,000 went independently and 119,000 took a school trip. Those who missed out last time seemed to be booking earlier than usual, which is why you ought to start concentrating on the brochures now. </p> <p>The weak euro works wonders for prices. Although Easter is relatively late - on 15 April - the Christmas and New Year transfers fall much more conveniently, with Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve on Sundays. </p> <p>The French ski schools have at last recognised the qualifications of British instructors. Some troubled beginners may miss the good old days when you could always blame your helplessness on not being able to understand what your French instructor was trying to tell you. But this change of attitude by the French will mean that British tour companies can again offer their clients English-speaking instruction and the popular ski guiding service. </p> <p>Last winter Austria was officially shunned by its European partners after the far-Right leader J\u00f6rg Haider's Freedom Party won ministerial places for the first time in a coalition government with the conservative People's Party, but generally skiers refused to join the boycott and after respectable snow, the traditional British favourite is again selling well. </p> <p> Italy didn't have the best of snow, and it remains to be seen whether the resorts and tourist offices can recoup some of last year's lost bookings. Only <strong>Cortina </strong> seems to have got off to a cracking start by announcing it will open on 1 December come what may, thanks to artificial snow. </p> <p><strong> Andorra</strong> is still spending heavily on lift improvements as it projects itself as more than just a cheap destination. <strong> Bulgaria</strong> has consolidated its position with bargain-hunters and the strong pound means that <strong> Switzerland </strong> almost feels affordable. </p> <p>Outside Europe, North America beckons. <strong> Canadian </strong> resorts are threatening to show their ski-tails to their US competitors, many of which had shaky early snowfalls last year and won't be helped by the strengthening of the American dollar against sterling. <strong> Vail</strong>, in Colorado, has regained its position as the top North American resort in the annual poll by Ski Magazine.<strong> Whistler</strong>, in Canada, which knocked it off the top spot last year, is down to third behind <strong> Deer Valley</strong>, Utah. <strong> Aspen</strong>, in fifth below <strong> Sun Valley</strong>, is pushing its $39-a-day lift-ticket offer for those booking before the end of November. <strong> Jackson Hole</strong>, Wyoming, tops the list for best terrain. </p> <p>The Canadian dollar isn't quite so cheap for us as last year but the Canadians are cock-a-hoop about their ski prospects. Konrad Bartelski, three times a British Olympic skier and long a fan of Canadian resorts, says exciting options are opening up in less-known resorts such as <strong> Fernie, Silver Star</strong> and <strong> Big White</strong>. Snow in the western resorts is very reliable. </p> <p>Despite all the hype, it is essential to put the whole North American ski scene into perspective. About 50,000 British skiers are expected to cross the Atlantic, compared with 750,000 who will head for European slopes this season. </p> <p><strong> What's New</strong></p> <p><strong>1. The specialist brochures</strong></p> <p> The demand, it seems, is for luxury. The best hotels and the most luxurious chalets are being taken first. Last-minute bookers who hang on to see whether snow conditions are good can expect to pay above the odds. And while the low-cost airlines do have bargain fares, remember, you have to book early for the best prices and then allow for the cost of travelling from the airport to the resorts, which can dent a modest budget. </p> <p>I had a taste of luxury chalets in the French Alps last February in<strong> Lotus Supertravel's </strong> (020 7962 9933) 'superchalet' Founets, just by the Bellecote piste in Courchevel 1850, and in <strong> Ski Beat's</strong> (01243 780405) chalet Annika, the most luxurious in La Plagne. </p> <p><strong> Erna Low</strong> (020 7584 2841), now represents the MGM luxury apartments. Besides being architecturally exciting, they are set beside the slopes in eight top French resorts and most have indoor swimming pools. </p> <p><strong> Ski Independence </strong> (0870 600 1462), best known perhaps for its holidays to 35 North American resorts, also has a busy ski-drive programme to 25 resorts in France and Switzerland. <strong> Motours</strong> (01892 677777) tops both these for choice with 63 ski-drive destinations in France, Switzerland, Austria and Italy. </p> <p>The advantage of talking to a specialist chalet company is that its staff know the resorts and even the individual chalets intimately. Many concentrate on the great French ski areas, Val d'Is\u00e8re, the Trois Vall\u00e9es and La Plagne. Among these are <strong> Le Ski </strong> (0870 754 4444) which runs its own ski school and is opening its own bar in Courchevel 1650,<strong> Finlays</strong> (01835 830562), and <strong> Meriski</strong> (01451 843100). Some specialise in one resort. Others such as <strong> Ski Esprit</strong> (01252 618300) and <strong> Ski Famille</strong> (01223 363777) concentrate on looking after children. </p> <p><strong> The Ski Club of Great Britain </strong> (020 8410 2022) - subscriptions are \u00a345 per person and \u00a366 for a family - offers an eclectic selection of holidays for skiers of all standards. There are special holidays for the over-fifties, for off-piste enthusiasts and even weeks for unaccompanied teenagers. </p> <p><strong> Ski Lagrange</strong> (020 7371 6111) has expanded its programme to include La Clusaz, La Rosi\u00e8re among 38 others in France and Andorra. <strong> Flexiski </strong> (0870 909 0754) has added St Moritz and St Christoph, home of the 100-year-old Arlberg Ski Club, to the five prestigious resorts it already sells. </p> <p><strong> Stanford Skiing</strong> (020 8789 2929), which uses only Meg\u00e8ve, has bought another hotel to cope with increased demand. </p> <p><strong> Inntravel</strong> (01653 629010), best known for relaxed holidays in mountain villages, is offering special weeks for novices to learn cross-country or downhill skiing. </p> <p><strong> Scott Dunn Ski</strong> (020 8767 0202), which headed the British discovery of Jackson Hole in the Nineties, concentrates more now on chalets and hotels in Zermatt and three French resorts. </p> <p> Directory of Ski Holidays available free. Phone the Association of Independent Tour Operators on 020 8607 9080. </p> <p><strong> 2. The big operators</strong></p> <p> The major firms, which singed their fingers last season, are hoping to bounce back using fat brochures full of enticements and a vast variety of resorts. </p> <p><strong> Crystal </strong> (0870 848 7000), which sells more holidays than any other operator, goes to 122 resorts in 11 countries, and has learn-to-ski-or-snowboard packages for 37 resorts. Many of its prices are lower than last year's. </p> <p><strong> Thomson </strong> (0870 606 1470) goes to more than 80 resorts in 11 countries and is strong on snowboarding. It has added 12 resorts including Alpach a friendly Austrian village.. </p> <p><strong> Inghams</strong> (020 8740 4433) is fighting back after a market reverse a couple of winters ago. </p> <p>As well as its usual brochure offering 10 countries, it has has another under its Bladon Lines brand for chalets and club hotels - the hot thing on the cold slopes - as well as a luxury brochure covering 44 resorts in seven countries. </p> <p><strong> First Choice </strong> (0870 754 3477) offers eight countries with club hotels mainly in France. </p> <p><strong> Neilson</strong> (08705 141414), with 11 countries, is offering \u00c5re in Sweden, Obergurgl in Austria and Vail for the first time. </p> <p> Get the big operators' brochures from travel agents, or phone them direct. </p> <p><strong>3. On the mountain</strong></p> <p> Greater environmental awareness has largely halted the expansion of ski areas into untouched valleys. Resorts are now more likely to concentrate on improving their lifts. Paradoxically, one of the exceptions is <strong> Vail</strong>, which last season suffered a series of arson attacks including the destruction of a large mountain-top restaurant complex. The resort has expanded into the <strong> Blue Sky Basin</strong> and is opening more terrain there this winter. </p> <p>There is less opposition to improving existing ski lifts, even though bigger ones spill even more skiers on to already busy pistes. I'm only just getting used to six-seater chairlifts, but soon I'll have to try one carrying eight. There has been one at <strong> Vradal</strong>, in Norway since 1997, and <strong> Nauders</strong>, in Austria, installed one last year. Now comes news that six more eight-seaters are to be unveiled: in <strong> M\u00e9ribel, Flaine </strong> and <strong> Les Deux-Alpes</strong> (which is promising two) in France, and in <strong> Ischgl </strong> and <strong> Hopfgarten</strong> in Austria. Each can lift up to 3,600 skiers an hour. </p> <p>Also in Austria <strong> Filzmoos</strong> is replacing single-seaters with quads, there are upgrades to gondolas at <strong> Lech </strong> and <strong> Mayrhofen</strong>, new gondolas at <strong> Hintertux, S\u00f6lden, S\u00f6ll</strong> and <strong> St Anton</strong>, and a new six-seater at <strong> Seefeld</strong>. </p> <p><strong>What it costs</strong></p> <p>No one can pretend that skiing is the cheapest of holidays. A family of four driving to self-catering accommodation in a French Alps centre may pay about \u00a335 per person per day sharing in January. A package holiday - flights, transfers, hotel half-board - doesn't go much below \u00a3300 per person per week in January and at the end of the season. Add to these prices the cost of lifts, ski school and, if necessary, ski and boot hire, and you're looking at at least \u00a3500 a head. If economy is paramount, check the brochures for Andorra, Bulgaria and Slovenia.</p> <p><strong>Diary dates</strong></p> <p>The British school half-term week starts on Saturday 17 February. The French ski holidays stretch from Saturday 3 February to Sunday 4 March. You have been warned...</p> <p><strong>Free to first-timers</strong></p> <p>Some experts are worried that the average age of skiers is growing and there are too few newcomers. Vail has even started charging the over-70s, who used to ski for free. To encourage newcomers, nine nations have formed the Association of Snowsports Countries. Thirty resorts spread over five of them - Austria, France, Slovenia, Switzerland and the US - are offering a week's free lift pass, free tuition and free hire equipment to any first-time skiers or snowboarders from 20-27 January. Ask your tour operator for details.</p>",

The existing Key scheme has been replaced by a star rating - the higher the star, the higher the standard of accommodation. 'Our main aim was to simplify what was perceived to be a complicated grading scheme. Under the Key scheme there were two components to the rating, one relating to the facilities and the other to the quality of the accommodation. We have combined the rating of facilities and quality into one single system,' said Mandy Lane, ETC's head of quality standards. In order to achieve a star rating each property has to meet a series of minimum requirements relating to cleanliness, clear pricing and booking conditions, comfortable accommodation and good facilities. Over 8,000 properties have been given star ratings so far. Tourist Information Centres can give local listings of graded properties and the English Tourism Council publishes a Where to Stay Guide which costs \u00a37.99 (0870 606 7204).",

      "body": "<p>The fact that Simphiwe happened to be sitting outside a bar on the main street in Hankey when he saw the tikoloshe was strictly coincidence. He hadn't had a single drink; he was only 12 then. He was sitting with his friend Michael and the tikoloshe went by on the other side of the street, right outside the bank, and Simphiwe turned to Michael to say, 'Look! A tikoloshe !' By which time the tikoloshe had vanished. 'But he was there, no doubt,' Simphiwe assured me. </p> <p>A tikoloshe is a mischievous creature with magical powers, about half the size of a man, naked, ugly, extremely hairy and, perhaps just as well, generally invisible. He is the consort of witches and will do their bidding. He lives among the reeds of the river, but regularly comes to town to steal eggs and terrorise the population. </p> <p>Simphiwe (pronounced 'Simpeewe') was now 19 and fully conversant with what Harry Potter would call the 'Dark Arts'. He lived among witches (igqwira in the Xhosa tongue) and witch doctors (igqira), spirits and mermaids. 'You think a witch rides around on the broomstick? That is ridiculous!' he laughed, amused by my naivety. 'No. A witch goes on a flying loaf of bread.' The loaf is, in fact, a snake or serpent which only looks like a loaf, as a kind of disguise. </p> <p>Simphiwe, who tended to wear his baseball cap sideways, had both a sharp sense of humour and a serious respect for the supernatural. We met in the legendary Jeffrey's Bay. Surfers come to these far-flung shores in the Eastern Cape region of South Africa for classic waves that sweep up out of Antarctica during the winter, and come here to die spectacularly. But for the week-long professional surfing contest, the waves had been, by 'J-Bay' standards, mediocre. And there was a strong consensus among surfers that these conditions were not unconnected with the omission of the traditional African blessing of the beach. Hard-line evangelical Christians had banned it. 'It's pagan, you know,' explained Regan, an imposing white woman who was PR chief for the contest. </p> <p>Simphiwe and I went sandboarding together, sliding down the huge dunes of Aston Bay, whooping and falling about like 10-year-olds. He offered to take me around his township, in Hankey, 30 miles inland, while most of the other surfers went off in search of lions. That was when he introduced me to black magic and to his grandmother, Nowaningi, who lived in a cool, comfortable house made of mud and cow dung. She reassured me that a tikoloshe cannot get into your house if you throw salt around the door and the windows. </p> <p>While I was enjoying a wholesome lunch of millet ( umnqusho ) about 10 relatives dropped in to discuss a witch who had been exorcised and gone into exile in Port Elizabeth. They still didn't trust him. 'Once a witch, always a witch,' said Simphiwe. </p> <p>We walked along railway tracks, past orange and lemon and mango groves down in the Gamtoos valley, and clambered up a steep, rocky cliff into the caves where Simphiwe used to play as a child. On top of the heights that dominate Hankey, we gazed down in awe on the massive tripartite divide that is still the rule, if not the law, in South Africa: whites at one end of town, in smart houses with shops and schools and clinics; blacks at the other, in mud houses on unmade streets populated by goats; and coloureds in between, living in shacks. </p> <p>Simphiwe pointed out a few signs of progress. Now most houses have electricity and TV aerials. 'When television first came here, they said it was a white thing,' he explained. 'Blacks weren't allowed to own a TV. It was illegal.' The first time a black family acquired a television, everyone would crowd into the house to watch it at 10 cents a time. The first programme Simphiwe ever saw was William Tell, after which he made a crossbow out of sticks. </p> <p>But Simphiwe was proud that, amid all the changes and outside influences (his aunties' favourite singers were Mariah Carey and Celine Dion), the blacks had kept their traditions. He was desperate for his 'initiation'. In bygone days, adolescent boys would be taken into the wilderness for six months or so. Either they learnt lessons about survival and made it back independently, or they didn't. Now, because most of the community are hip urbanites, inexperienced at hunting and making a fire with sticks, the initiates are taken to a secluded spot a short way out of town. There they are cut off from women (and rivers, in case of mermaids) for a month and have to survive without salt or sugar or yeast, and suck their water out of a barrel of mud. And they must mount a vigil at night against witchcraft. But they are allowed regular supplies. Still, they do have to burn their clothes, live in improvised wigwams and - the scariest part - be circumcised with a spear (and without anaesthetic). </p> <p>Simphiwe took me to meet four old friends undergoing their initiation. They wore catapults at their hips and blankets as loin cloths and were smothered from head to toe in white clay, which had a symbolic value and was also useful for keeping the insects off. They were drowsy with lack of sleep, but glad to see Simphiwe and went slickly through some of their old karate routines together (one of them was a black belt, and Simphiwe could kick the branch of a tree higher than my head). </p> <p>But there was a lot of anxious talk of spears. Several recent circumcisions elsewhere had gone wrong and a number of deaths had occurred. There was a trend towards disposable spears, to avoid sharing. What with the slaughtered cow, the party, and the new clothes needed after graduation, the whole business was dangerous and cost up to \u00a3300. But Simphiwe wanted to go through with his initiation, otherwise he would be reviled and not be allowed to marry. </p> <p>He took me to the house of the local witch doctor, a large, mesmeric woman called Gloria, whose father had been an Anglican vicar. She preferred to be known as a 'traditional healer'. Gloria could cure various ailments, including impotence, with a cocktail of herbs and potions, and provide protection against spells. She gave me a small chunk of magic bark, which would enable me to utter 'words of power' and influence people. She told me my fortune, something Simphiwe shied away from, lest he learn the day of his death. </p> <p>When we got back to town, the evangelical Regan scrutinised me rigorously. 'You haven't been listening to all that mumbo-jumbo, have you?' she said. 'All you need to do is open your heart to God and go forth with peace and joy.' </p> <p>I never saw a tikoloshe while I was in Hankey. However, driving back to J-Bay at dusk, we did observe something black and whirling and dervish-like in the headlamps.

After a chance encounter with an Afrikaner farmer's daughter, Agatha Schellingerhout, at the town library, she invited us back to the spacious farmhouse built by her father, Dirk, who showed me a PhD thesis (by Wendy Dilys Coetzee) about the origins of Hankey (founded by an early nineteenth-century missionary of that name who acquired most of the land from the Hottentots). Simphiwe had never been in a white farmhouse before. And they had never had a black kid to tea before either.

      "bodyText": "The fact that Simphiwe happened to be sitting outside a bar on the main street in Hankey when he saw the tikoloshe was strictly coincidence. He hadn't had a single drink; he was only 12 then. He was sitting with his friend Michael and the tikoloshe went by on the other side of the street, right outside the bank, and Simphiwe turned to Michael to say, 'Look! A tikoloshe !' By which time the tikoloshe had vanished. 'But he was there, no doubt,' Simphiwe assured me. A tikoloshe is a mischievous creature with magical powers, about half the size of a man, naked, ugly, extremely hairy and, perhaps just as well, generally invisible. He is the consort of witches and will do their bidding. He lives among the reeds of the river, but regularly comes to town to steal eggs and terrorise the population. Simphiwe (pronounced 'Simpeewe') was now 19 and fully conversant with what Harry Potter would call the 'Dark Arts'. He lived among witches (igqwira in the Xhosa tongue) and witch doctors (igqira), spirits and mermaids. 'You think a witch rides around on the broomstick? That is ridiculous!' he laughed, amused by my naivety. 'No. A witch goes on a flying loaf of bread.' The loaf is, in fact, a snake or serpent which only looks like a loaf, as a kind of disguise. Simphiwe, who tended to wear his baseball cap sideways, had both a sharp sense of humour and a serious respect for the supernatural. We met in the legendary Jeffrey's Bay. Surfers come to these far-flung shores in the Eastern Cape region of South Africa for classic waves that sweep up out of Antarctica during the winter, and come here to die spectacularly. But for the week-long professional surfing contest, the waves had been, by 'J-Bay' standards, mediocre. And there was a strong consensus among surfers that these conditions were not unconnected with the omission of the traditional African blessing of the beach. Hard-line evangelical Christians had banned it. 'It's pagan, you know,' explained Regan, an imposing white woman who was PR chief for the contest. Simphiwe and I went sandboarding together, sliding down the huge dunes of Aston Bay, whooping and falling about like 10-year-olds. He offered to take me around his township, in Hankey, 30 miles inland, while most of the other surfers went off in search of lions. That was when he introduced me to black magic and to his grandmother, Nowaningi, who lived in a cool, comfortable house made of mud and cow dung. She reassured me that a tikoloshe cannot get into your house if you throw salt around the door and the windows. While I was enjoying a wholesome lunch of millet ( umnqusho ) about 10 relatives dropped in to discuss a witch who had been exorcised and gone into exile in Port Elizabeth. They still didn't trust him. 'Once a witch, always a witch,' said Simphiwe. We walked along railway tracks, past orange and lemon and mango groves down in the Gamtoos valley, and clambered up a steep, rocky cliff into the caves where Simphiwe used to play as a child. On top of the heights that dominate Hankey, we gazed down in awe on the massive tripartite divide that is still the rule, if not the law, in South Africa: whites at one end of town, in smart houses with shops and schools and clinics; blacks at the other, in mud houses on unmade streets populated by goats; and coloureds in between, living in shacks. Simphiwe pointed out a few signs of progress. Now most houses have electricity and TV aerials. 'When television first came here, they said it was a white thing,' he explained. 'Blacks weren't allowed to own a TV. It was illegal.' The first time a black family acquired a television, everyone would crowd into the house to watch it at 10 cents a time. The first programme Simphiwe ever saw was William Tell, after which he made a crossbow out of sticks. But Simphiwe was proud that, amid all the changes and outside influences (his aunties' favourite singers were Mariah Carey and Celine Dion), the blacks had kept their traditions. He was desperate for his 'initiation'. In bygone days, adolescent boys would be taken into the wilderness for six months or so.

The BBC is enjoying unprecedented success. </p> <p>BBC1 and BBC2 have increased their share of the peak-time audience by an average 20 per cent. The number of viewers of the games is up one-third on the last Olympics in Atlanta. </p> <p>Unofficial viewing figures show that the BBC's daytime viewing has increased from 1-1.5 million to around 2-2.5 million - 35 per cent of the audience. The evening highlights programme, The Day Down Under , has attracted an average five million viewers with a peak of 8.3 million - 4 million more than normal for that time of day. </p> <p>When Steve Redgrave won his fifth gold medal in consecutive Olympics, BBC1 captured a massive 75 per cent share of the viewing audience. ITV has been hit by the BBC's success and its daytime share has fallen to an estimated 27 per cent. </p> <p>After a wretched year which has seen the BBC lose the rights to screen premier league football highlights, meaning the end of Match of the Day , the Olympic success has delighted BBC bosses. Richard Sambrook, acting director of sport, said: 'This has been a British achievement of the highest order and BBC Sport is proud to salute the entire Team GB who worked so hard and provided the nation with its finest sporting moments for years.' </p> <p>The figures come as a relief following criticism of the BBC for spending millions of pounds sending almost 400 technicians and producers to cover the games. One BBC source said: 'It's been a rotten time. We have lost shows and been criticised by newspapers and MPs. But we have proved that the BBC is the vehicle to get behind the British team. It is of course as much to do with how great our athletes are as it is to do with our coverage but at last we really have something we can shout about.' </p> <p>The BBC's success contrasts with poor ratings for other international broadcasters. Last week NBC, the US network, tumbled to its lowest levels for any summer Olympics night of competition since the 1970s. NBC has been criticised for its narrow focus on US athletes and 'melodramatic' coverage. </p> <p>BBC coverage got off to a good start with 4 million - a 53 per cent share - watching the opening ceremony. It improved the next day when Jason Quealy unexpectedly won a gold medal in the cycling. Three million people tuned in to see his triumph - double the audience for a normal Grandstand . </p> <p>Average weekday morning audiences were 2.5 million - up from the usual 1 million for Kilroy , Call My Bluff and City Hospital . The weekday evening round-up attracted a peak audience of 8 million beating the ITV police drama, The Bill . </p> <p>Almost 7 million people saw Steve Redgrave win the coxless fours in the early hours of last Saturday morning setting up the BBC for a record weekend. Five million watched Maurice Greene go for gold in the men's 100m final - almost 60 per cent of the audience. Some 6.6 million saw Denise Lewis win the heptathlon - 63 per cent of viewers. </p> <p>The BBC's Sport Online website has received an average 800,000 hits a day. Last Monday the total reached 3 million - the highest ever. 'People were logging on from work to keep up to date with track and field,' a BBC source said. </p> <p>NBC has been criticised in the US for devoting most of its daily broadcast to a narrow spectrum of sports: swimming, gymnastics, baseball and track and field. Programme makers have also been condemned for concentrating too heavily on US medal hopefuls. </p> <p>In its regular 8-11pm programme NBC averaged a 22 per cent share among adults aged 18-49, according to preliminary ratings. On the opening day of the games the figure was 13.6 per cent. </p> <p>Although the BBC's Olympics figures are high they cannot compete with audiences for football. ITV's coverage of Manchester United's European Champions League win over Bayern Munich last year was watched by 15.62m people. The England v Scotland Euro 2000 play-off match earlier this year captured 14.6m. The most-watched sporting event ever was the 1966 World Cup Final which was seen live by 27 million.</p>",

When Steve Redgrave won his fifth gold medal in consecutive Olympics, BBC1 captured a massive 75 per cent share of the viewing audience. ITV has been hit by the BBC's success and its daytime share has fallen to an estimated 27 per cent. After a wretched year which has seen the BBC lose the rights to screen premier league football highlights, meaning the end of Match of the Day , the Olympic success has delighted BBC bosses. Richard Sambrook, acting director of sport, said: 'This has been a British achievement of the highest order and BBC Sport is proud to salute the entire Team GB who worked so hard and provided the nation with its finest sporting moments for years.' The figures come as a relief following criticism of the BBC for spending millions of pounds sending almost 400 technicians and producers to cover the games. One BBC source said: 'It's been a rotten time. We have lost shows and been criticised by newspapers and MPs. But we have proved that the BBC is the vehicle to get behind the British team. It is of course as much to do with how great our athletes are as it is to do with our coverage but at last we really have something we can shout about.' The BBC's success contrasts with poor ratings for other international broadcasters. Last week NBC, the US network, tumbled to its lowest levels for any summer Olympics night of competition since the 1970s. NBC has been criticised for its narrow focus on US athletes and 'melodramatic' coverage. BBC coverage got off to a good start with 4 million - a 53 per cent share - watching the opening ceremony. It improved the next day when Jason Quealy unexpectedly won a gold medal in the cycling. Three million people tuned in to see his triumph - double the audience for a normal Grandstand . Average weekday morning audiences were 2.5 million - up from the usual 1 million for Kilroy , Call My Bluff and City Hospital . The weekday evening round-up attracted a peak audience of 8 million beating the ITV police drama, The Bill . Almost 7 million people saw Steve Redgrave win the coxless fours in the early hours of last Saturday morning setting up the BBC for a record weekend. Five million watched Maurice Greene go for gold in the men's 100m final - almost 60 per cent of the audience. Some 6.6 million saw Denise Lewis win the heptathlon - 63 per cent of viewers. The BBC's Sport Online website has received an average 800,000 hits a day. Last Monday the total reached 3 million - the highest ever. 'People were logging on from work to keep up to date with track and field,' a BBC source said. NBC has been criticised in the US for devoting most of its daily broadcast to a narrow spectrum of sports: swimming, gymnastics, baseball and track and field. Programme makers have also been condemned for concentrating too heavily on US medal hopefuls. In its regular 8-11pm programme NBC averaged a 22 per cent share among adults aged 18-49, according to preliminary ratings. On the opening day of the games the figure was 13.6 per cent. Although the BBC's Olympics figures are high they cannot compete with audiences for football. ITV's coverage of Manchester United's European Champions League win over Bayern Munich last year was watched by 15.62m people. The England v Scotland Euro 2000 play-off match earlier this year captured 14.6m. The most-watched sporting event ever was the 1966 World Cup Final which was seen live by 27 million.",

In the tiny swaying room, she struggled into her tartan pyjamas, and climbed the stepladder to her bunk, banging her head on the ceiling. The light went off, leaving the cabin in darkness save for the rhythmic sweep of orange street lamps. Outside the window, a wet Friday night in Watford slipped by. </p> <p>We were on a sleeper train to Fort William. It was our first wedding anniversary, and this long weekend was meant to provide the perfect backdrop: a romantic train journey; a glorious drive through the Highlands; and two nights on beautiful, mountainous, desolate Skye. Eight hours later, I sat on my bunk gazing out of the window through a grey dawn at a brooding loch and snow-capped peaks beyond. 'Wake up,' I whispered to my wife. 'The romantic bit has started.' At Fort William, we picked up a hire car and drove 80 miles to Kyle of Lochalsh, the mainland gateway to The Misty Isle. The opening of the Skye Road Bridge in 1995 has made Skye the most accessible of the Hebridean islands. Five minutes and \u00a34.70 later we were heading across Skye's southern flatlands towards the sawtooth profile of the Cuillin, the island's famous mountain range. The weather here is mercurial. One minute, a mackerel sky casts a benign, ethereal glow, warming the ochre heather that carpets the lower slopes.

The main road ended at Dunvegan, and we took a single track for a further five miles along the lonely banks of Loch Dunvegan. Then we spotted The Three Chimneys restaurant - an appropriate name for a journey that began with a train (maybe only fans of E. Nesbit will appreciate this). Since moving to the crofter's cottage at Colbost from Croydon 15 years ago, Shirley and Eddie Spear have built a worldwide reputation for fine food and wine.

For the main course her legendary Skye crab risotto, and the fillet of Highland beef in Madeira sauce on a sage potato cake were to die for. One food critic wrote that the restaurant should be on everybody's list of things to do before they expire. The man on the next table looked fit to explode as he went for his second pudding. In 1999, the Spears thoughtfully opened six huge and stunningly designed rooms adjoining the restaurant, so that visitors could stagger under the weight of a swollen stomach the 30 yards to bed. That night, drifting off to the sound of the brook running past our window, and feeling the salty breeze coming over the Minch, I fell into the kind of sleep I'd only experienced under general anaesthetic. </p> <p>After breakfast that included smoked salmon, venison, cured ham and oatcakes, we headed around the Duirinish peninsula. At Ramasaig we started a four-hour walk on tracks, soft peat, past the foaming waterfalls of Gleann a' Phuill and An Dubh Loch, and through the deserted crofting village of Lorgill, whose people were shipped to Nova Scotia after the Highland Clearances of the mid-nineteenth century. We picked our way over volcanic rocks and climbed a steep, grassy slope speckled with primroses, then looked down at the kelp forests dancing in the pellucid water of Lorgill Bay. We carried on along seriously vertiginous cliffs with views across the glassy Sea of the Hebrides to North and South Uist.

      "bodyText": "We were as cheered as you to learn that William Hague has a confidante who cooks him chocolate cakes and goes by the alias Mother Goose, a fictitious creature held to be the source of all nursery rhymes. The French title of the original - Contes de ma m\u00e8re l'oye - has come to mean 'tall stories' or 'old wives' tales' in France, and so a friend of that name for Mr 14-pints is not totally inappropriate. But there are questions to be asked. Why the name Mother Goose, for one? His friend claims to have adopted the name at the time of the Squidgy tapes, feeling, she told The Observer , the need for an alias when phoning the Leader of the Opposition to offer advice. But forgive us, Mrs Whitehead. The landlady of a Dales bed-and-breakfast could not be said to need a codename in the way that, say, the wife of the heir to the throne might need one. On the other hand, the leader of Her Majesty's Opposition might well wish to remain incognito when discussing matters of state with a member of the public. So, what, do you suppose, did he ask her to call him? Suggestions on a postcard.",

In response he gleefully aimed a jet of water straight at my face. But who could blame him for having his bit of fun at the expense of foreigners who were 'trespassing' on his home. </p> <p>But who could blame us? La Frasn\u00e9e is stunning. It lies at the bottom of one of the awesome steep-walled, U-shaped valleys common to France's Jura mountains. Twenty or so stone houses hunker down beneath 500ft-high beetling cliffs and at the end of the road lies the hamlet's own waterfall, looking like the setting for those Consulate cigarette ads of the Seventies. No crowds, only one unpretentious bar close to the cascade, deserted in the early September sunshine. La Frasn\u00e9e does not even merit a mention in the Michelin Green Guide. </p> <p>Waterfalls, water pistols... water was to become rather a theme of this holiday. We were staying in a Eurocamp mobile home (running water, our own shower and toilet) by the shores of the Lac de Clairvaux, about an hour's drive from the Swiss border. The children had to decide every day between the site's swimming pool (heated, with water slide) and the beach by the lake (muddier water, but fish to spot while snorkelling and free use of the Eurocamp canoes). </p> <p>Apart from the boy, the welcome everywhere was kind and friendly. France must have its share of surly teenagers, but where do they work? Certainly not in the holiday or catering industries. My husband dropped his first glass of cold beer. In a flash the smiling young woman in charge of the nearby crepe stall disappeared into the bar to get us another. She waved away my profuse thanks. 'C'est pas gentil, c'est normale.' Only my daughter was nonplussed: 'Why do you say \"messy\" for thank you, Mummy?' </p> <p>Waterfalls are everywhere in the Jura. Among the most famous are the Cascades du H\u00e9risson. From 2,641ft above sea level in the Chaux-du-Dombief cirque the H\u00e9risson (hedgehog) river drops 920ft in just a couple of miles by cutting a series of narrow gorges and forming seven spectacular waterfalls. Water, speed, noise... Aidan, eight, and six-year-old Laura were wildly excited and tumbled about as exuberantly as the river. </p> <p>As well as the obligatory waterfall, the village of Baume-les-Messieurs, a few miles north, has an ancient abbey, founded in the sixth century, a trout-laden river (La Seille) and a comprehensive network of caves complete with underground lake and a 'great hall' 262ft high. In England this would merit a purpose-built visitor centre plus a dozen cream tea and gift shops. Here there were only two bars, one closed, and barely a dozen cars in the abbey car park. </p> <p>Until the sixteenth century the village had been called Baume-les-Moines (monks), but as the way of life at the abbey grew more worldly (for which read 'fun', probably) the humble brothers were replaced by canons of high birth (you had to have at least 16 noble ancestors in your coat of arms to be admitted) who changed the name to Baume-les-Messieurs (gentlemen). </p> <p>A similarly pragmatic attitude to religious life was displayed by the abbesses of nearby Chateau-Chalon, which is credited with inventing vin jaune, the knee-bucklingly strong fortified wine of the Jura. It is said that, denied the pleasures of the flesh, the good nuns poured all their passion into wine. Such is the wine's similarity to sherry that, according to local legend, a high-born Spanish lady sent to the abbey to take up a life of prayer arrived with vine cuttings secreted in her luggage and recipes for wine among the leaves of her prayer book. </p> <p>That Spanish lady would have felt at home, in the reliably hot (30C ) and sunny weather we enjoyed for days. As we stood under a cloudless sky in front of Baume's pretty, cave-peppered waterfalls, we wondered where all these gallons of water could possibly be coming from. </p> <p>We found out that night. In the small hours a huge storm blew up, making further sleep impossible even after the thunder had moved on. A Swiss friend explained how weather systems cross France from the Atlantic, cool as they reach the Alps and start shedding their considerable loads of water. With no wind to move the clouds on it had rained solidly for 2 weeks in July, and sev eral tent-dwelling Brits and Dutch had given up and gone home early. </p> <p>So what do you do on a lakes and mountains holiday when you can't see the mountains and there are lakes forming round your feet? Step forward the Eurocamp Circus Club, for children aged four to 13, whatever the weather. Parents are spared being confined in a rain-lashed tent with a couple of energetic children because a cheery young British courier volunteers to be confined in a different rain-lashed tent with up to 20 energetic children. </p> <p>This was just as well: other wet-weather options were distinctly lacking in child - and adult - appeal. A salt mine at Salins-les-Bains; a restored hydraulic sawmill with displays on uses of the spruce tree; a toy museum looked promising, but its main feature was 'films on the evolution of manufacturing techniques from wood to plastic'. </p> <p>But we are spared these delights. After a day's deluge the sun reappears. The first thing the children want to do, of course, is to get wet again. But heigh-ho, we can keep an eye on them from the sunny poolside - and have a couple more of those cold beers. Messy beaucoup. </p> <p>\u0095 Liz Myers travelled with Eurocamp (01606 787878) and stayed at Fayolan, in Clairvaux-les-Lacs, in the Jura. A 14-night holiday in a mobile home for a family of five costs from \u00a3689 in low season to \u00a31,379. This includes a short sea crossing for a car and passengers (a Eurotunnel crossing costs an extra \u00a338 in peak season). The same holiday in a tent costs between \u00a3451 and \u00a3931.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Billy McIntyre steeled himself as best he could. As he reached the entrance to the hospital ward he paused, took a deep breath and somehow managed to drag a smile on to his lined, pale face - as he had done every night for weeks before visiting his daughter.</p> <p>Donna was in her usual position, curled up awkwardly in the worn, green leather reclining chair beside her bed at the end of the ward. The visit last Monday started well enough: father hugging and tickling daughter, while keeping up the smile and a steady stream of upbeat chatter. But the 21 year old's mood changed, and she became agitated and distressed. Then, in a momentary flicker of lucidity that crushed all her dad's mental preparations, she looked straight at him and asked: 'Am I dying?'</p> <p>The straightforward answer is: yes. Donna is far too ill to comprehend her rapidly-deteriorating condition, let alone deal with its inevitable conclusion, so her father laughed off the question. But three weeks ago she was diagnosed as one of the latest cases of new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), the fatal brain disorder which is the human form of BSE, or mad cow disease. She is unlikely to survive much beyond next spring.</p> <p>McIntyre, an electrician from Aberdeen, has now taken the unusual decision to speak publicly about his daughter's plight while she is still alive. While the bereaved relatives of some victims have provided a glimpse of vCJD's impact, Donna's story provides a sobering insight into the daily ordeal being endured by the McIntyres and at least eight other families across the UK - a plight caused by the scandal of farmers feeding cattle with the brains and vertebrae of other animals, and the repeated disgrace of Ministers and civil servants' failure to stop it.</p> <p>'I still don't believe this is happening to us,' McIntyre told The Observer . 'This is something that affects people on television and in the newspapers, not my daughter. Every day, I try to imagine how I would feel if it was me, to imagine how it must be for her, but it tears me apart just to think about it.'</p> <p>His intervention comes as the mad cow disease scandal returns to centre stage. This week Lord Phillips, chairman of the public inquiry into BSE, will hand his long-awaited final report to Ministers. After two-and-a-half years and more than \u00a316 million, the 16- volume report will be the definitive judgment on the causes of the BSE/CJD affair and the adequacy of Ministers' response.</p> <p>Although Phillips had already made clear that the findings would not decide the thorny issue of liability, the victims' families had hoped the report would pave the way for the Government to set up a compensation scheme. But last week a leaked Whitehall memo revealed that Ministers have decided not to take any blame for the crisis. About \u00a34bn has been spent on a no-fault scheme to compensate farmers for culled cattle, but Ministers, says the memo, baulked at the prospect of a multi-billion pound compensation bill from human victims.</p> <p>When the inquiry began in March 1998, the disease had claimed 24 lives. The toll is now 74. A further eight victims are still alive, according to official figures which do not yet include Donna.</p> <p>For the McIntyres, news of the memo was devastating. Less than a month after they were told that Donna had contracted a disease which should never have been allowed to emerge, they found they also may face a long, painful legal battle for damages.</p> <p>'It is sickening what the politicians have tried to do,' said her father. 'They knew about the problems in the food chain, about spinal cords and other bits of animals getting mixed into cattle feed, but they did nothing. Now they won't take responsibility.</p> <p>'Money is the last thing on our minds now, but I hope Tony Blair chokes on his breakfast when he reads about my daughter.'</p> <p>Donna's life was just coming together when early signs of the disease emerged. She was working as a receptionist in Aberdeen and living in a rented flat there. She was shy, but at weekends she went dancing with friends. Nothing trendy; Donna remains a loyal fan of Take That. Like any young woman, she was meticulous about her appearance.</p> <p>Last Easter, she stayed at her father's small terraced council house. It was the first time they had spent together for three years, and they both loved it. Donna even talkedof giving up her flat and moving back in. She spent the week there. Then she disappeared.</p> <p>For two months the family heard nothing. Telephone calls and letters went unanswered. Her flat was deserted. In July, she should have celebrated her twenty-first birthday. McIntyre and his partner, Bernadette Prescott, sent a card and tried to find her. Nothing.</p> <p>This is classic vCJD behaviour. In the initial stages, victims are unable to comprehend what is happening to their bodies. They merely know that something is going wrong. They become depressed and paranoid, withdrawing into themselves. Some have nightmares. But the McIntyre family could not have known.</p> <p>When Donna eventually resurfaced, the news was not good. She had been sleeping rough and had a serious skin condition and a bizarre twitching in her limbs.</p> <p>Donna began believing that other people were present in the room. She would talk to them. Sometimes she would demand that someone stand up and offer their chair to her brother, Thomas, who died in a fire in 1996.</p> <p>Like many other relatives of vCJD victims, Donna's family started suspecting mental problems. After several visits to her GP, she was referred to psychiatrist. But he was unable to help.</p> <p>By mid-August, Donna's condition was still worse. There were violent mood swings, her speech was slow and badly slurred, and her short-term memory had faded. She was losing the use of her arms and legs, her balance had gone and she needed support to walk. On 28 August, she went into Aberdeen Royal Infirmary for tests.</p> <p>'We had no idea what it could be, although it was obviously serious,' said McIntyre. 'They tested her for multiple sclerosis and diseases like that, but they kept coming up with nothing. We didn't even think about it being vCJD.</p> <p>'Donna was always a meat-eater; she liked her burgers and her pies, but it never crossed our mind that her illness could have had anything to do with that.'</p> <p>A week after Donna was admitted, her father was called to the hospital by his daughter's consultant. The doctor told him the tests had found no alternative, treatable explanation - she was 50 per cent certain Donna had vCJD. Cases cannot be confirmed without analysis of the brain after death but, under rules introduced this year, living probable cases can be diagnosed by the National CJD Surveillance Unit in Edinburgh. Its specialists tested Donna and confirmed the diagnosis.</p> <p>Sitting in his living room surrounded by photographs of Donna and her six brothers and sisters, McIntyre struggled with tears to describe the impact of that: 'My whole body just went numb. I couldn't take it in. I tried to ask questions but I couldn't form any words. Then I broke down. I'm not ashamed of it - I cried like a baby.'</p> <p>Donna's body is now failing fast. She behaves most of the time like a very young child, sitting in her green chair, smiling to herself but unable to follow events around her, or to understand simple questions. As dementia slowly took hold, her short-term memory all but disappeared. Sometimes, she has failed even to recognise her father. Occasionally, some lucidity returns and she becomes more animated and engaged.</p> <p>The physical effects of the disease are obvious, too. Pale and thin, her legs can no longer support her weight, and she is frequently incontinent. Last Friday night, The Observer arrived at the hospital as a guest of her family to find Donna lying, extremely distressed, on the floor beneath her chair. She had realised she needed to use the toilet but her legs had given way and she had fallen over, soiling her pyjamas in her distress. Her brain is so damaged, she is almost certainly unable to tell that her body is deteriorating.</p> <p>Unlike her family. 'Sometimes I have to drag myself up to see her because I am so scared to see what condition she is in,' said her father. 'Then I feel a huge guilt - what we're going through is nothing compared to how she is suffering.'</p> <p>He knows worse is to come. Before long, Donna will lose the power of speech completely. Her eyesight will fade, and she will be unable to swallow. Eventually, she will have to be fed by a tube. Even then, however, death could be months, rather than weeks, away.</p> <p>But McIntyre is determined to see her through to the end with dignity. Against medical advice, he plans to take her home to care for her himself. 'It will be hard, but there will soon be a time when she is no longer there and I don't need to care for her any more. Any time we have is precious.'</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:stuart.millar@theguardian.com\">stuart.millar@theguardian.com</a></p>",

      "body": "<p><strong> 1. The basics: forget plot, but remember the importance of 'situation'</strong> </p> <p> I won't try to convince you that I've never plotted any more than I'd try to convince you that I've never told a lie, but I do both as infrequently as possible. I distrust plot for two reasons: first, because our lives are largely plotless, even when you add in all our reasonable precautions and careful planning; and second, because I believe plotting and the spontaneity of real creation aren't compatible. </p> <p>A strong enough situation renders the whole question of plot moot. The most interesting situations can usually be expressed as a What-if question: </p> <p> What if vampires invaded a small New England village? (Salem's Lot). </p> <p> What if a young mother and her son became trapped in their stalled car by a rabid dog? (Cujo). </p> <p>These were situations which occurred to me - while showering, while driving, while taking my daily walk - and which I eventually turned into books. In no case were they plotted, not even to the extent of a single note jotted on a single piece of scrap paper. </p> <p> <strong> 2. Similes and metaphors - the rights, the wrongs</strong> </p> <p> When a simile or metaphor doesn't work, the results are sometimes funny and sometimes embarrassing. Recently, I read this sentence in a forthcoming novel I prefer not to name: 'He sat stolidly beside the corpse, waiting for the medical examiner as patiently as a man waiting for a turkey sandwich.' If there is a clarifying connection here, I wasn't able to make it. </p> <p>My all-time favourite similes come from the hard-boiled-detective fiction of the 40s and 50s, and the literary descendants of the dime-dreadful writers. These favourites include 'It was darker than a carload of assholes' (George V Higgins) and 'I lit a cigarette [that] tasted like a plumber's handkerchief' (Raymond Chandler). </p> <p> <strong> 3. Dialogue: talk is 'sneaky'</strong> </p> <p> It's dialogue that gives your cast their voices, and is crucial in defining their characters - only what people do tells us more about what they're like, and talk is sneaky: what people say often conveys their character to others in ways of which they - the speakers - are completely unaware. </p> <p>Well-crafted dialogue will indicate if a character is smart or dumb, honest or dishonest, amusing or an old sobersides. Good dialogue, such as that written by George V Higgins, Peter Straub or Graham Greene, is a delight to read; bad dialogue is deadly. </p> <p> <strong> 4. Characters: nobody is the 'bad-guy'</strong> </p> <p> The job boils down to two things: paying attention to how the real people around you behave and then telling the truth about what you see. It's also important to remember that no one is 'the bad guy' or 'the best friend' or 'the whore with a heart of gold' in real life; in real life we each of us regard ourselves as the main character, the protagonist, the big cheese; the camera is on us , baby. If you can bring this attitude into your fiction, you may not find it easier to create brilliant characters, but it will be harder for you to create the sort of one-dimensional dopes that populate so much pop fiction. </p> <p> <strong> 5. Pace: fast is not always best</strong> </p> <p> Pace is the speed at which your narrative unfolds. There is a kind of unspoken (hence undefended and unexamined) belief in publishing circles that the most commercially successful stories and novels are fast-paced. Like so many unexamined beliefs in the publishing business, this idea is largely bullshit... which is why, when books like Umberto Eco's The Name of the Rose suddenly break out of the pack and climb the bestseller lists, publishers and editors are astonished. I suspect that most of them ascribe these books' unexpected success to unpredictable and deplorable lapses into good taste on the part of the reading public. </p> <p>I believe each story should be allowed to unfold at its own pace, and that pace is not always double time. Nevertheless, you need to beware - if you slow the pace down too much, even the most patient reader is apt to grow restive. </p> <p> <strong> 6. Do the research, but don't overdo it for the reader</strong> </p> <p> You may be entranced with what you're learning about flesh-eating bacteria, the sewer system of New York, or the IQ potential of Collie pups, but your readers are probably going to care a lot more about your characters and your story. </p> <p>Exceptions to the rule? Sure, aren't there always? There have been very successful writers - Arthur Hailey and James Michener are the first ones that come to my mind - whose novels rely heavily on fact and research. Other popular writers, such as Tom Clancy and Patricia Cornwell, are more story-oriented, but still deliver large dollops of factual information along with the melodrama. I sometimes think that these writers appeal to a large segment of the reading population who feel that fiction is somehow immoral, a low taste which can only be justified by saying, 'Well, ahem, yes, I do read [fill in author's name here], but only on airplanes and in hotel rooms that don't have CNN; also, I learned a great deal about [fill in appropriate subject here].'</p> <p>\u00a9 2000 Stephen King.</p> <p><strong>Are you the next Stephen King?</strong></p> <p> A unique international opportunity to win the chance to have your own short story published and to meet the king of storytellers</p> <p> To enter this once-in-a-lifetime competition, please send us an unpublished short story in the spirit of Stephen King.

      "body": "<p>Angelo Gaja's winery in the hilltop town of Barbaresco is protected by a forbidding steel gate, a modern version of a medieval portcullis. Italy's most famous winemaker, a man whose love of publicity can make Posh and Becks look bashful, likes to keep ordinary punters at arm's length. 'The winery regrets that it is unable to receive or sell to the public at large,' says a sign in four languages.</p> <p>Getting to see or speak to Gaja isn't easy - he's the sort of bloke whose PA has his own PA - but if you get past the flunkies there are few better interviewees. Gaja talks at the speed of a Formula One racing car, his language a restless ratatatat of facts, quotable opinions and statistics. He's one of the few winemakers I know who asks and answers his own questions. His enthusiasm is tangible.</p> <p>Gaja has a lot to be enthusiastic about. He makes not one but several of Italy's greatest wines. Slow Food's indispensable 2000 Italian Wines Guide (\u00a324.95, Grub Street) awarded its three-glasses award to only 182 wines this year; Gaja produced four of them. It is no exaggeration to say that he is the leading Italian winemaker of his generation, a man who has transformed the image of his native Piedmont.</p> <p>Gaja sees himself as a catalyst for change. 'When I started in 1961, there were only 100 people bottling Barbaresco and Barolo. Now there are 800, and 600 of them are small growers who used to sell their grapes to big merchant houses. Everyone wants to make better wines. It's exactly the same in Tuscany and Sicily.'</p> <p>It hasn't always been thus. Gaja is a strong-willed modernist in a profoundly traditional region. He was regularly criticised for his efforts in the early years, just as Piero Antinori, a near contemporary, was in Tuscany. As a local joke put it at the time: 'Have you heard about this fellow called God wandering around Barbaresco pretending to be Angelo Gaja? He must be an imposter.'</p> <p>Undaunted, Gaja introduced new ideas to north-west Italy: small oak barrels, temperature-controlled fermentation and international grapes such as Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc and Cabernet Sauvignon.</p> <p>As a result, Gaja was accused of making international wines, a charge that, even today, makes him raise his arms in frustration. 'I hate international wines; they're exactly what I don't want to produce.' Gaja can smile about this, mind you. One of his wines, a Langhe Cabernet Sauvignon, is called Darmagi ('What a shame' in Italian) in honour of his father. 'That was his response when I planted Cabernet,' he laughs.</p> <p>For all his love of French grapes, Gaja is extremely proud of Italy's heritage. 'We've got 250 fantastic local varieties in Italy that don't exist anywhere else. We've also got a greater range of grape-growing climates than anyone. If we continue to experiment - and avoid being trapped by tradition and the arrogant belief that we have nothing to learn from other countries - then the future is very promising.'</p> <p>Gaja's main focus, the grape that 'I have in my heart', is Nebbiolo, a difficult variety that shares certain characteristics with Burgundy's Pinot Noir. Like Pinot, it is highly sensitive to soil type, climate and vintage variation, like Pinot it performs best in its region of origin, like Pinot it is expensive to produce well.</p> <p>No one is as good at teasing the best out of Nebbiolo, a grape that accounts for 70 per cent of what Gaja makes. 'When I visit my friends in Bordeaux, they say it's better to have more than one grape variety in your vineyards, to have different colours to paint with. Nebbiolo is different. It's a single colour, but with many tones. You have to work harder to express them, using different clones, microclimates and soils, but it's a world-class grape.' Gaja makes Nebbiolos under five main labels - Costa Russi, Sori San Lorenzo and Sori Tildin in Barbaresco and Sperss and Conteisa in Barolo. Each of these is a single vineyard wine and each reflects Gaja's confidence in the grape's subtle mutability.</p> <p>Piedmont is the main focus of Gaja's considerable energy. But in recent years, he's diversified into Tuscan wines, too. In 1994, he bought the Pieve di Santa Restituta estate in Montalcino; two years later he started planting 55 hectares of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot in coastal Bolgheri, the source of two of Italy's best Bordeaux-style reds: Sassicaia and Ornellaia. In both cases, Gaja was treated as an outsider at first. 'They didn't want someone speaking with a Piedmontese dialect,' he says. Not any more. The presence of Gaja, always achieving, always innovating, is a boon for any region.</p> <p>As far as further expansion is concerned, Tuscany is Gaja's final frontier. Unlike Piero Antinori, who has established a number of overseas joint ventures, Gaja plans to stay in Italy. 'I want to keep the mind of an artisan, not a businessman,' he says. 'I need to put my nose and fingers into everything I do. There are only 24 hours in a day, so I have to face the fact that there are physical limitations to my work.' Even Gaja has to sleep sometime.</p> <p>Gaja's wines are not cheap. The top reds are as expensive as almost anything produced in Bordeaux, Burgundy or the Napa Valley. Indeed, Italian wine expert David Gleave of importer Liberty Wines says that Gaja's greatest contribution has been to 'show producers that there is a market for fine Italian wine and that quality can pay'. It sure can: a case of 1996 Costa Russi will cost you more than \u00a31,400.</p> <p>Gaja defends his prices by pointing at world demand for the 25,000 cases he produces. 'I don't fix the price of my wines, the market does. We have a certain credibility and there are consumers who are prepared to make small sacrifices to buy a bottle of Gaja.' He also argues that charging a lot for his wines enables him to make sacrifices of his own. 'We made no Barbaresco in 1984 and 1992 because the wines weren't good enough and in 1987 we declassified 50 per cent of the crop. These are very expensive decisions for a winemaker.'</p> <p>Now 60, Gaja is as sprightly as ever. His next big challenge is to 'produce great wine in Bulgheri'. The first vintage, the 1999 Magari, will be released in 18 months' time and, like most of Gaja's wines, it will sell, and no doubt sell well, at an as-yet-to-be-fixed high price. After that, who knows what he'll do? 'I feel eternal,' he tells me at the top of his voice. 'Eternal.' Anyone who loves Italian wine will be glad to hear it.</p> <p>\u0095 For details of other Gaja wines contact John Armit or Lay &amp; Wheeler.

It's a single colour, but with many tones. You have to work harder to express them, using different clones, microclimates and soils, but it's a world-class grape.' Gaja makes Nebbiolos under five main labels - Costa Russi, Sori San Lorenzo and Sori Tildin in Barbaresco and Sperss and Conteisa in Barolo. Each of these is a single vineyard wine and each reflects Gaja's confidence in the grape's subtle mutability. Piedmont is the main focus of Gaja's considerable energy. But in recent years, he's diversified into Tuscan wines, too. In 1994, he bought the Pieve di Santa Restituta estate in Montalcino; two years later he started planting 55 hectares of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot in coastal Bolgheri, the source of two of Italy's best Bordeaux-style reds: Sassicaia and Ornellaia. In both cases, Gaja was treated as an outsider at first. 'They didn't want someone speaking with a Piedmontese dialect,' he says. Not any more. The presence of Gaja, always achieving, always innovating, is a boon for any region. As far as further expansion is concerned, Tuscany is Gaja's final frontier. Unlike Piero Antinori, who has established a number of overseas joint ventures, Gaja plans to stay in Italy. 'I want to keep the mind of an artisan, not a businessman,' he says. 'I need to put my nose and fingers into everything I do. There are only 24 hours in a day, so I have to face the fact that there are physical limitations to my work.' Even Gaja has to sleep sometime. Gaja's wines are not cheap. The top reds are as expensive as almost anything produced in Bordeaux, Burgundy or the Napa Valley. Indeed, Italian wine expert David Gleave of importer Liberty Wines says that Gaja's greatest contribution has been to 'show producers that there is a market for fine Italian wine and that quality can pay'. It sure can: a case of 1996 Costa Russi will cost you more than \u00a31,400. Gaja defends his prices by pointing at world demand for the 25,000 cases he produces. 'I don't fix the price of my wines, the market does. We have a certain credibility and there are consumers who are prepared to make small sacrifices to buy a bottle of Gaja.' He also argues that charging a lot for his wines enables him to make sacrifices of his own. 'We made no Barbaresco in 1984 and 1992 because the wines weren't good enough and in 1987 we declassified 50 per cent of the crop. These are very expensive decisions for a winemaker.' Now 60, Gaja is as sprightly as ever. His next big challenge is to 'produce great wine in Bulgheri'. The first vintage, the 1999 Magari, will be released in 18 months' time and, like most of Gaja's wines, it will sell, and no doubt sell well, at an as-yet-to-be-fixed high price. After that, who knows what he'll do? 'I feel eternal,' he tells me at the top of his voice. 'Eternal.' Anyone who loves Italian wine will be glad to hear it. \u0095 For details of other Gaja wines contact John Armit or Lay &amp; Wheeler. Valvona &amp; Crolla (0131 556 6066) has a good selection of older vintages. Best cellars Three great Gaja wines 1996 Sito Moresco, Langhe (\u00a320.95, Lay &amp; Wheeler, 01206 764 446). Something of an oddity in the Gaja stable in that it contains 15 per cent Merlot and Barbera, this is a very smart Nebbiolo-based red with new oak flavours balanced by fine tannins and considerable structure. 1996 Sitorey, Langhe (\u00a322.50, John Armit, 020 7908 0660; \u00a322.35, Lay &amp; Wheeler). One of the best Barberas in Italy, this spicy, deeply coloured red has luscious, sweet tannins, marked acidity and flavours of cherry, blackberry and plum. 1994 Barolo Sperss (\u00a336, John Armit). A subtle, truffley, comparatively youthful Barolo that is just beginning to lengthen its stride, this richly tannic red needs at least another decade in bottle to reach its peak.",

      "body": "<p>Deputy Sheriff Everett Smith pushed open the door of his brother's trailer home in a heavily wooded area on the outskirts of Fryeburg, Maine, last Friday. Bryan Smith, a 43-year-old former construction worker, appeared to be asleep in bed. He was dead. There was no sign of trauma or indication that he had died in pain. The empty bottles of painkillers found nearby were the only indication of probable cause. </p> <p>'There he was, on his back in bed, covered up,' said Sheriff James Miclon. 'He was just laying there, like he went to sleep.' A preliminary postmortem examination was inconclusive, and toxicology reports are not expected to be complete for months. </p> <p>Smith's death did not just end his own ill-fated life: it closed a remarkable saga involving a loner and one of the world's bestselling authors that has gripped the public. </p> <p>In June last year, it was Smith's blue Dodge caravan that crashed into Stephen King, who was out for a walk, with such force that the author's head smashed the windscreen. As King himself wrote in The Observer last week, the writer was lucky to survive. </p> <p>Smith was a forlorn figure. Since another accident in 1979 he had lived engulfed by difficulties that seemed to be getting worse: he lived alone, drew disability payments and took occasional jobs as a wood-cutter and mechanic when the pain of his injuries was not too bad. Yet in the year after the collision, friends said Smith was tormented as much by remorse as pain. </p> <p>Losing his driving licence after the crash with King only made his problems worse, forcing him either to hitch lifts or to walk several miles to town using crutches, and he had recently learnt he might have to start using a wheelchair. </p> <p>He lived alone except for two Rottweilers, Pistol and Bullet. His driving record was appalling - 11 convictions since 1989 for speeding and driving under the influence - in an area where driving is hardly an art. </p> <p>But it was not until he topped the crest of an incline in his Dodge while simultaneously trying to prevent one of his dogs rummaging in a beer cooler that Smith's life took on a wider public profile. </p> <p>The van swerved off the road just as King, taking his regular four-mile walk, was returning from relieving himself in the woods . The impact threw the writer up and over the van, propelling him into a ditch 14 feet away. 'I was surprised he was even alive,' recalled a local man, Donald Baker, who witnessed the crash from his pick-up truck. 'He was in a tangled-up mess, lying crooked, and had a heck of gash in his head. He kept asking what had happened.' </p> <p>As they waited for help to arrive, Smith appeared nonchalant. He thought he'd hit a deer until he noticed King's bloody glasses on his front seat. </p> <p>'His look, as he sits with his cane drawn across his lap, is one of pleasant commiseration,' King recalled. 'It says \"Ain't the two of us just had the shittiest luck\".' </p> <p>Bad luck indeed. The collision of metal and flesh, as well as the briefly conjoining fates of King and Smith, seemed fit for one of the author's books. But it wasn't: King is recovering from a shattered hip and pelvis, broken ribs, punctured lung and fractured thigh bone. And Smith, a drifter without much luck, is dead. </p> <p>'This is a guy who only has a little bit of brains to begin with. I mean I have fantasies of confronting him,' King wrote in the extract. 'But Bryan Smith is like Gertrude Stein said about LA \"There's no there, there\".' </p> <p>'Call it fate, call it God ... But what you're left with is this guy, who has the IQ of a tomato soup can. An empty tomato soup can. And he hits me at the one blind spot on a long road, no one else to hit for miles, when, say Nasa can't get a missile to land on Mars with all the brains and technology in the world, then you think there's something odd going on. Or maybe Nasa should just hire Bryan Smith.' </p> <p>Smith's death was widely reported in the US press and his life was largely reduced to that of a bit player in the life of the author. Reports played heavily on the connections between King's work and his chance encounter with Smith, using word play such as 'final chapter,' 'last few pages' and 'surprise ending'. Susan Stone, in a letter of complaint to the Bangor Daily News , the paper that first reported Smith's demise, wrote that she was disturbed by the 'callous manner' in which the paper reported his death and found it to be 'in extremely poor taste'. </p> <p>But the intersection of fame and anonymity where King and Smith met did neither of them a favour. Before his death, Smith often said he felt singled out for harsher treatment because of King's celebrity. 'Just because it's Stephen King,' he said, 'he can make up his own laws, his own rules. I'm being used as a guinea pig. I know I hit him. I didn't mean to. Somebody can't accept that. Why can't they accept that it was an accident?' </p> <p>There was often a note of self-pity in his comments to the press. 'They don't look at my handicap,' he said after the accident that elevated his name to that of an answer to a Trivial Pursuit question. 'They don't care if I breathe tomorrow or die the next day.' </p> <p>King, who has undergone gruelling therapy after three weeks in hospital, was incensed when Smith described the crash as an 'accident without a cause' and chided prosecutors for making a deal with Smith that did not include any jail time and did not permanently revoke his licence. </p> <p>The incident caused friction within the small-town community that both called home.

King called Smith's plea bargain - resulting in the driving ban and a six-month suspended jail sentence - 'irresponsible public business'. </p> <p>But Smith later offered apologies to King and accepted responsibility for the accident.

      "byline": "Mark Morris",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It's often the simplest things that go wrong. Hong Kong director Wong Kar-Wei was convinced that his new film, provisionally called Summer in Beijing, was going to be a quick, relaxing experience following the logistical nightmare of his Buenos Aires-set gay love story, Happy Together, released in 1997. </p> <p>Sitting in London's, Soho House, dressed in his trademark blue shirt, blue jeans and shades, Hong Kong's most independently minded director is piecing together the story of how In The Mood For Love, became 'the most difficult film of my life'. </p> <p>The effort has clearly been worthwhile. Feted by critics from Cannes to Edinburgh, In The Mood For Love, starring Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung, further enhances his reputation as one of the most talented and distinctive filmmakers in world cinema. It is set to be his most successful film to date. </p> <p>It was originally going to be so straightforward. 'Right after Happy Together we wanted to start a film. Happy Together was a very difficult film because it was the first time we shot outside of Hong Kong - in Argentina, a place so far away, and we spoke no Spanish. After that I thought we should make a more simple film, not so expensive, with two actors: an actor and an actress I've worked with before, and we had good communications. And a very simple story. A film like that should be like a vacation. But somehow it's like the film has been cursed. </p> <p>'We wanted to make the film in Beijing, but we had problems with the censor's department in China. For some reason they didn't like the title. For us, Summer In Beijing seems to be a very romantic title, but for them, obviously it's not. And we wanted to shoot some of the scenes in Tiananmen Square, and we had to stop that. And so I thought maybe we would have to stop this project, and start something else. </p> <p>'So we started another story, a film in a restaurant called Beijing, and we could still have 'Summer In Beijing'. It's about food. But we came across the Asian financial crisis, and we had to find new investors. At this stage I thought we would have to give up: Maggie Cheung had other commitments. But we found other investors in Europe and started shooting the film. But because we all had commitments on other projects, we shot the film on and off, and it took 15 months.' </p> <p>But that wasn't the end of it. Wong Kar-Wei had made a commitment that the film was going to appear at Cannes this year. The print was meant to be ready the day they left Bangkok, where the film was shot. But it wasn't. The subtitles had to be hurriedly done in Paris en route to the festival. Nor was its successful Cannes debut the end of the trouble. </p> <p>'Right before I went to Edinburgh, we found some problems and I had to hand carry the film to the festival.' </p> <p>Not that you could tell any of this from watching the film. It is as economical and restrained as film making can be. 'I always tell people this film is like chamber music,' Kar-Wei says. </p> <p>There are a handful of sets, and very few actors. The film focuses entirely on the characters played by Leung and Cheung, who move into neighbouring flats in 1962 Hong Kong. Eventually they work out that their respective spouses (never shown) are having an affair. They start meeting for dinner, role-playing how the adulterers came together, and rehearsing confrontations. Eventually, this turns into some kind of a relationship, but how much of one is never made too clear. 'We had a love scene,' Kar-Wei says, 'but at the last moment I cut it. Because the whole thing happened in 1962, and people in that period were not explicit, and the story should not be explicit.' </p> <p>Indeed Kar-Wei never works with a full script. 'I was a writer before, and I hate writing. I think a script is just like a blueprint. Since most of the people have worked with us since my first film, we know each other very well.' His films evolve, right up to the point audiences finally see them. The character's lives can turn out to be very different from how they started. Cheung says she had little idea what the story was before she saw the film. </p> <p>'And he didn't know either,' she says 'If he told you differently, he's lying. I don't think an actor is ever comfortable with that. Even though I love the film, it's a shame... if only I had known that my part was like that from before I would have made it a bit more interesting, not necessarily to watch, but for myself to play. I would have had a better journey with the part. I think I missed out on the fun of acting, which was a shame. But it was built day by day.' </p> <p>It was all worth it though: In The Mood For Love is easily one of the films of the year, and coming after Happy Together, Fallen Angels and the wonderful Chungking Express, it confirms Kar-Wei's status. A few people thought the earlier films were too cool for their own good - too much hip Christopher Doyle camerawork showing good-looking people smoking a lot in neon-lit cities, and not much else. But In The Mood For Love makes it clear that what is left out is very deliberate. Ambiguity is the key, letting the audience work out what is going on. </p> <p>This film's chasteness, its loving recreation of the Shanghai immigrant community in early Sixties Hong Kong, is the very opposite of empty flash. 'It reminds me a lot of my personal experiences as a child,' Kar-Wei says. He was born in Shanghai, but the family moved to Hong Kong when he was five. He's now 42. </p> <p>He is a big man, with an aura of studied cool typified by the slightly ridiculous decision to wear sunglasses at all times. That doesn't quite work in the way it should, because you can still see his eyes behind the tint. </p> <p>The cool slips away when he talks about English football - not just the Premiership, but the trainspotting depths of the Nationwide league. The other part of his trademark look is the smoking. There are other recurrent tics in his films (Sixties pop, clocks) but the cigarettes you can't fail to notice. </p> <p>No one lights up for the first half-hour or so of In The Mood For Love, and its director says: 'I tried to smoke less during the shooting. But one day I thought I've had enough, I should let it go. I think it's something subconscious reflecting my situation during the production. Like we try to avoid the clock, but in the end, I thought, why?' </p> <p>In a Hong Kong film industry where stars often make 10 films a year, Kar-Wei stands out. He has had martial arts in his earlier movies, and gangsters, but most of his work, especially recently, has been small scale and love-lorn. Couple his outsider status with those unusual working habits, and it is no surprise that he uses the same crew and actors again and again. </p> <p>'For instance, in In The Mood For Love we had to spend 15 months together, and Maggie and Tony had other commitments, and you have to know the situation in Hong Kong. Often stars make two films at the same time, and in a very short period. So to work with us, we need someone who is very understanding. Maggie and Tony both input a lot in the film, and we have a lot of trust between us.' </p> <p>He has already finished two of the three segments of his next film, 2046. People have referred to it as his science-fiction film. 'It's more like a stage play. It happens in the future, but it's not so futuristic or not so science fiction, so don't expect something like The Matrix. </p> <p>The idea came from a promise the Chinese Government gave in 1997: they promised to leave Hong Kong 50 years unchanged.

      "bodyText": "It's often the simplest things that go wrong. Hong Kong director Wong Kar-Wei was convinced that his new film, provisionally called Summer in Beijing, was going to be a quick, relaxing experience following the logistical nightmare of his Buenos Aires-set gay love story, Happy Together, released in 1997. Sitting in London's, Soho House, dressed in his trademark blue shirt, blue jeans and shades, Hong Kong's most independently minded director is piecing together the story of how In The Mood For Love, became 'the most difficult film of my life'. The effort has clearly been worthwhile. Feted by critics from Cannes to Edinburgh, In The Mood For Love, starring Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung, further enhances his reputation as one of the most talented and distinctive filmmakers in world cinema. It is set to be his most successful film to date. It was originally going to be so straightforward. 'Right after Happy Together we wanted to start a film. Happy Together was a very difficult film because it was the first time we shot outside of Hong Kong - in Argentina, a place so far away, and we spoke no Spanish. After that I thought we should make a more simple film, not so expensive, with two actors: an actor and an actress I've worked with before, and we had good communications. And a very simple story. A film like that should be like a vacation. But somehow it's like the film has been cursed. 'We wanted to make the film in Beijing, but we had problems with the censor's department in China. For some reason they didn't like the title. For us, Summer In Beijing seems to be a very romantic title, but for them, obviously it's not. And we wanted to shoot some of the scenes in Tiananmen Square, and we had to stop that. And so I thought maybe we would have to stop this project, and start something else. 'So we started another story, a film in a restaurant called Beijing, and we could still have 'Summer In Beijing'. It's about food. But we came across the Asian financial crisis, and we had to find new investors. At this stage I thought we would have to give up: Maggie Cheung had other commitments. But we found other investors in Europe and started shooting the film. But because we all had commitments on other projects, we shot the film on and off, and it took 15 months.' But that wasn't the end of it. Wong Kar-Wei had made a commitment that the film was going to appear at Cannes this year. The print was meant to be ready the day they left Bangkok, where the film was shot. But it wasn't. The subtitles had to be hurriedly done in Paris en route to the festival. Nor was its successful Cannes debut the end of the trouble. 'Right before I went to Edinburgh, we found some problems and I had to hand carry the film to the festival.' Not that you could tell any of this from watching the film. It is as economical and restrained as film making can be. 'I always tell people this film is like chamber music,' Kar-Wei says. There are a handful of sets, and very few actors. The film focuses entirely on the characters played by Leung and Cheung, who move into neighbouring flats in 1962 Hong Kong. Eventually they work out that their respective spouses (never shown) are having an affair. They start meeting for dinner, role-playing how the adulterers came together, and rehearsing confrontations. Eventually, this turns into some kind of a relationship, but how much of one is never made too clear. 'We had a love scene,' Kar-Wei says, 'but at the last moment I cut it. Because the whole thing happened in 1962, and people in that period were not explicit, and the story should not be explicit.' Indeed Kar-Wei never works with a full script. 'I was a writer before, and I hate writing. I think a script is just like a blueprint. Since most of the people have worked with us since my first film, we know each other very well.' His films evolve, right up to the point audiences finally see them. The character's lives can turn out to be very different from how they started. Cheung says she had little idea what the story was before she saw the film. 'And he didn't know either,' she says 'If he told you differently, he's lying. I don't think an actor is ever comfortable with that. Even though I love the film, it's a shame... if only I had known that my part was like that from before I would have made it a bit more interesting, not necessarily to watch, but for myself to play. I would have had a better journey with the part. I think I missed out on the fun of acting, which was a shame. But it was built day by day.' It was all worth it though: In The Mood For Love is easily one of the films of the year, and coming after Happy Together, Fallen Angels and the wonderful Chungking Express, it confirms Kar-Wei's status. A few people thought the earlier films were too cool for their own good - too much hip Christopher Doyle camerawork showing good-looking people smoking a lot in neon-lit cities, and not much else. But In The Mood For Love makes it clear that what is left out is very deliberate. Ambiguity is the key, letting the audience work out what is going on. This film's chasteness, its loving recreation of the Shanghai immigrant community in early Sixties Hong Kong, is the very opposite of empty flash. 'It reminds me a lot of my personal experiences as a child,' Kar-Wei says. He was born in Shanghai, but the family moved to Hong Kong when he was five. He's now 42. He is a big man, with an aura of studied cool typified by the slightly ridiculous decision to wear sunglasses at all times. That doesn't quite work in the way it should, because you can still see his eyes behind the tint. The cool slips away when he talks about English football - not just the Premiership, but the trainspotting depths of the Nationwide league. The other part of his trademark look is the smoking. There are other recurrent tics in his films (Sixties pop, clocks) but the cigarettes you can't fail to notice. No one lights up for the first half-hour or so of In The Mood For Love, and its director says: 'I tried to smoke less during the shooting. But one day I thought I've had enough, I should let it go. I think it's something subconscious reflecting my situation during the production. Like we try to avoid the clock, but in the end, I thought, why?' In a Hong Kong film industry where stars often make 10 films a year, Kar-Wei stands out. He has had martial arts in his earlier movies, and gangsters, but most of his work, especially recently, has been small scale and love-lorn. Couple his outsider status with those unusual working habits, and it is no surprise that he uses the same crew and actors again and again. 'For instance, in In The Mood For Love we had to spend 15 months together, and Maggie and Tony had other commitments, and you have to know the situation in Hong Kong. Often stars make two films at the same time, and in a very short period. So to work with us, we need someone who is very understanding. Maggie and Tony both input a lot in the film, and we have a lot of trust between us.' He has already finished two of the three segments of his next film, 2046. People have referred to it as his science-fiction film. 'It's more like a stage play. It happens in the future, but it's not so futuristic or not so science fiction, so don't expect something like The Matrix. The idea came from a promise the Chinese Government gave in 1997: they promised to leave Hong Kong 50 years unchanged. So 2046 is the last year of that promise, and I wanted to explore whether there will be anything unchanged.' How much has changed already? 'Not much. A lot of people in Hong Kong are afraid of change, but change is not a bad thing.' Kar-Wei's feelings about In The Mood For Love remain appropriately ambiguous. 'It was the most miserable period of my life, but my feeling about the film is that I didn't want to stop, I didn't want to let go. The reason we wanted to show the film in Cannes was so that we had a deadline. Otherwise, we could still be making it now.'

      "body": "<p>There is only one question about Dr Mary Archer that hangs almost as heavily over her this weekend as do the criminal charges that were levelled against her husband last week, and it is this: why in God's name does she stay with him? Here is a woman who, through the study of her beloved chemistry, has dedicated her professional life to the pursuit of great scientific truths. And yet in her personal life she has dedicated herself to a man whose grasp upon truth is at best questionable. </p> <p>'I think she probably gets a lot out of the marriage,' says Michael Crick, Jeffrey Archer's biographer. 'She gets fame, fun and, until recently, she got social status.' A former acquaintance of the couple sees it simply as a diversion from what could otherwise have been an arid life amid the dull obsessions of academe: 'She likes his games and experiments, because it makes her life more interesting.' In this analysis Jeffrey Archer - millionaire novelist, former bankrupt, disgraced politician and, since 1992, Baron Archer of Weston-super-Mare - is Mary Archer's bit of rough. He puts the colour in her otherwise dull life. In return, she plays the dutiful, supportive wife when the occasion calls for it. </p> <p>Clearly last week was not one of those occasions. She was absent when he arrived at Wimbledon police station to be charged with two counts of perjury, two of perverting the course of justice and one of using a false instrument. Nor was she to be seen that evening when, in one of the more bizarre twists in Lord Archer's narrative, he appeared on stage in Windsor in the first public performance of The Accused , his courtroom drama in which he plays an alleged murderer and upon whom, after hearing the evidence, the audience delivers a verdict. </p> <p>Doubtless, however, Mary will be at his side when he finally has to trudge to court - perhaps as early as Tuesday when he is due to appear at Bow Street Magistrates Court. For this is the pattern that their life together now traces: he gets into a scrape, attempts valiantly to tough it out, confesses all to Mary, who then lends her public support to the husband with whom she now spends relatively little time in private. </p> <p>There can be no more classic example than the most recent: that weekend last November after Archer's forced withdrawal from the London mayoral election, following the revelation that he had allegedly solicited a friend to provide a false alibi for him in his successful 1987 libel case against the Daily Star (out of which this week's charges arose). There were Mary and Jeff, photographed together in the Old Vicarage at Grantchester, exchanging loving looks, as he wrote letters of apology. 'I am cross,' she said, 'but I have formed the judgment that he is a decent and generous spirited man over 35 years and that will not change over one weekend.' She didn't care what others said - she was standing by her man. This weekend, she is said, by one close friend, to be 'very surprised, very downcast and very shocked' by the charges that Archer now faces. Well she might be. For if the charges against her husband are proven, it sullies the entirety of the 1987 libel trial, the very episode that invented her in the imagination of the British public. In one of the most priapic summations in the history of libel law, the late Mr Justice Caulfield turned to the jury and said of her, without a flicker of irony: 'Has she not grace? Has she not fragrance?' Sadly, for Mary at least, any sweet fragrance that surrounded that libel victory may now be turning into a rather nasty smell. </p> <p>Mary Archer was born Mary Doreen Weeden in December 1944, the daughter of Harold Weeden, a chartered accountant from Surrey. It was, by Mary's own testimony, 'a pretty average middle-class family'. She followed her sister to Cheltenham Ladies' College where she is recalled by a contemporary, Kate Trelford, as 'very clever and very quiet... a very cool customer'. She went to St Anne's College, Oxford, from where she graduated with a double first in chemistry, and where, as an undergraduate,she met Archer, four years her senior. </p> <p>They married in 1966 though she now says that at 22 she was 'much too young'. Why did she do it? 'Jeffrey seemed more mature, older than my contemporaries,' she said. 'So the partnership felt reasonably grown up.' After graduation, they moved to London where she studied at Imperial College and he pursued his political career, ending up as Conservative MP for Louth. </p> <p>In 1974 came the first Archer disaster when Aqua- blast, a company in which he had invested \u00a3250,000 of borrowed money, collapsed. It was nearly a week after the bankruptcy petition had been filed against him in the High Court before he told his wife. She was in the middle of a second birthday party for their son, William. 'I felt weak at the knees,' she later said, 'but there was nothing else to do except carry on with the party.' There has, it seems, never been anything else for Mary Archer to do but carry on with the party. </p> <p>Having resigned as an MP, Jeffrey set about writing them out of debt. 'Being in debt is worse than anything else,' Mary later said, 'and I've tried a few things.' (She has also said that great wealth is likewise a managerial trial.) She, meanwhile, supported the family by lecturing in chemistry at Trinity College, Cambridge, where she remained until 1986. By then, Jeffrey had hit the big time with his third novel, Kane and Abel . It is from this period that their increasingly separate lives are said to have developed, he spending week- days in London in his Thames-side penthouse before returning to Grantchester, where she had made her home, for weekends. </p> <p>There has been much speculation over how much Mary Archer knew of her husband's intimate relationship with his long-time assistant, Andrina 'Andy' Colquhoun, but she has always claimed to place marital fidelity low on the list of priorities. 'If you mean strict sexual fidelity,' she once said, 'it doesn't rank terribly high on my scale of the importance of things. In a quite objective sense, it can be tolerated more than indifference.' Whether she has applied that code to her own conduct is unclear, though she is said to have her own circle of friends. </p> <p>In 1987, any such questions had to be put to one side as, day after day, she accompanied her husband to court, while he fought his libel trial. The Star had accused him of consorting with prostitutes, notably Monica Coghlan, to whom he had given \u00a32,000. Mary emerged a public figure, f ted for her great - to some, completely unexpected - fashion sense and apparent grace under fire. Not that it seemed to affect her greatly. 'I feel nothing, nothing at all,' she said at the trial's end. 'When something cataclysmic happens I think you feel like that afterwards.' </p> <p>She now embarked on a new career in public life, becoming a trustee of the Science Museum and sitting on various energy advisory boards to the Department of Trade and Industry. She chaired the Hardship Committee at Lloyds of London, where she was already a Name, and joined the board of Anglia Television. Once more, Jeffrey upset the apple cart: in 1994, without telling his wife, he bought shares in Anglia just before a take-over bid for the company. There were allegations (never proven) of insider dealing. Mary confessed to being 'embarrassed' by the affair. </p> <p>Indeed, she seems to have created a uniquely restrained language to describe the behaviour of her husband and its impact upon her. She has talked about his 'gift for inaccurate pr\u00e9cis'. She has dismissed his scandals as his 'little bombshells'. After last November's revelation, she simply announced: 'We are all human but Jeffrey manages to be more human than most.' </p> <p>This cool, almost detached approach to his dramas tallies with the recollections of those who dealt with her when she was chairing the Lloyds Hardship Committee. 'She was quite extraordinary, like a machine,' says Fernada Herford, who represented one of the largest groups of Names. 'There were these people who had been completely devastated and she sailed through without a whisker of compassion. She is a tough and heart less lady.' Christopher Stockwell, chairman of the Lloyds Names Association Working Party at the time, agrees. 'I never warmed to her,' he says. 'I always thought ice-maiden was a more appropriate term than fragrant.' To those who know her well, however, Mary Archer is not so much cold as analytical, particularly where her husband is concerned. 'Mary Archer has had 30 years to acquire a very decent perspective on her husband,' says a friend. 'She's not still there through inertia but through a lively appreciation of his qualities, which are immense, and an enlarged sense that he's taken her on an adventure through life that she would otherwise not have had.' But if we want a real understanding of Mary Archer, we might best be served by going back to that libel trial. During her evidence, she was asked what she recalled of her husband's conversation with Adam Raphael, then political editor of The Observer . Raphael said that Archer told him he had met Coghlan months before he paid her the money. In court, Archer denied he said such a thing and Mary Archer backed him up. </p> <p>Before she did so, however, she told her husband's barrister: 'I would like to say that, although it is my very genuine recollection that this was the conversation with Mr Raphael I cannot say that that recollection is not overlaid by the wish that it was so.' The implication is extraordinary: that Mary Archer, the ice-cool scientist, famed for her acute intellect, is powered through her curiously detached marriage by the very same thing that has powered her husband throughout his adult life - wishful thinking. That may well came in handy as together they face Lord Archer's latest adventure in court. </p> <p><strong> MARY DOREEN ARCHER</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> DoB :</strong> 22 December 1944 </p> <p><strong> Educated: </strong> Cheltenham Ladies' College; St Anne's, Oxford; Imperial College, London </p> <p><strong> Status: </strong> Married to Lord Archer of Weston-super-Mare (AKA Jeffrey Archer) </p> <p> <strong> Interests: </strong> Reading, writing, singing </p> <p><strong> Home: </strong> Grantchester, Cambridge </p> <p><strong> Quote :</strong> 'We are all human, but Jeffrey manages to be more human than most'</p>",

      "bodyText": "There is only one question about Dr Mary Archer that hangs almost as heavily over her this weekend as do the criminal charges that were levelled against her husband last week, and it is this: why in God's name does she stay with him? Here is a woman who, through the study of her beloved chemistry, has dedicated her professional life to the pursuit of great scientific truths. And yet in her personal life she has dedicated herself to a man whose grasp upon truth is at best questionable. 'I think she probably gets a lot out of the marriage,' says Michael Crick, Jeffrey Archer's biographer. 'She gets fame, fun and, until recently, she got social status.' A former acquaintance of the couple sees it simply as a diversion from what could otherwise have been an arid life amid the dull obsessions of academe: 'She likes his games and experiments, because it makes her life more interesting.' In this analysis Jeffrey Archer - millionaire novelist, former bankrupt, disgraced politician and, since 1992, Baron Archer of Weston-super-Mare - is Mary Archer's bit of rough. He puts the colour in her otherwise dull life. In return, she plays the dutiful, supportive wife when the occasion calls for it. Clearly last week was not one of those occasions. She was absent when he arrived at Wimbledon police station to be charged with two counts of perjury, two of perverting the course of justice and one of using a false instrument. Nor was she to be seen that evening when, in one of the more bizarre twists in Lord Archer's narrative, he appeared on stage in Windsor in the first public performance of The Accused , his courtroom drama in which he plays an alleged murderer and upon whom, after hearing the evidence, the audience delivers a verdict. Doubtless, however, Mary will be at his side when he finally has to trudge to court - perhaps as early as Tuesday when he is due to appear at Bow Street Magistrates Court. For this is the pattern that their life together now traces: he gets into a scrape, attempts valiantly to tough it out, confesses all to Mary, who then lends her public support to the husband with whom she now spends relatively little time in private. There can be no more classic example than the most recent: that weekend last November after Archer's forced withdrawal from the London mayoral election, following the revelation that he had allegedly solicited a friend to provide a false alibi for him in his successful 1987 libel case against the Daily Star (out of which this week's charges arose). There were Mary and Jeff, photographed together in the Old Vicarage at Grantchester, exchanging loving looks, as he wrote letters of apology. 'I am cross,' she said, 'but I have formed the judgment that he is a decent and generous spirited man over 35 years and that will not change over one weekend.' She didn't care what others said - she was standing by her man. This weekend, she is said, by one close friend, to be 'very surprised, very downcast and very shocked' by the charges that Archer now faces. Well she might be. For if the charges against her husband are proven, it sullies the entirety of the 1987 libel trial, the very episode that invented her in the imagination of the British public.

      "body": "<p>It's the first of October and here we are at the end of something, facing the empty quarter of the year, speeding along, barely noticing the passing of time, getting older and more infantile along the way, and the world is turning brown. One of the worst changes over the past 25 years is that it is rare for a stubble field to be left for more than a few weeks, and normal for it to be cultivated within days of harvest. </p> <p>OK, so the townies among you don't notice or care about these things, but if your personal landscape is defined by fields rather than streets, this changes everything. The great autumnal tapestry of faded ochre and green is now lost. Stubble fields were places where you could walk without damaging anything, and for a few months the countryside was opened up to arable land in a way that it never is now. It is all part of the way farmers are alienating the rest of us from the landscape. In the process, autumn has turned from a tawny, golden place to a uniformly brown one. </p> <p>Why this outburst of bile? It's mainly because I think brown is a deadly colour in the garden. It must be used very carefully indeed, if it is not to weigh down too heavily on the eye and spirits. Copper and bronze, on the other hand, add richness and depth. The trick is not to confuse either with brown. For the last month, the best example of this distinction has been with fabulous sunflowers 'Velvet Queen' and 'Prado Red'. The yellow shining through the brown tint, with orange pollen in the central discs and the burgundy colour of the stems gives the 'brown' a burnished-coppery tint that electrifies the colour. The flowers dominate the September garden. Helenium 'Moerheim Beauty' doesn't overwhelm in anything like the same way but is just as powerfully, if more modestly, effective. It has become so acclaimed and ubiquitous that it is almost a horticultural clich\u00e9, but then you could say the same of carrots or grass. </p> <p>We also have H 'Red and Gold', which is less well known but works equally well at creating the dispersed russet burnish. Rudbeckia hirta is grown as an annual (although it is actually biennial or even perennial in the right conditions) and 'Gloriosa Daisy Mix' has rich, orangey-copper tones, as does 'Rustic Dwarfs', although this might include the odd truly yellow flower which, in a fit of puritanical zeal to retain metallic status, can be smartly snipped off. </p> <p>Again and again, as you look closely at flowers, you see that it is the combination of colours that makes colour effects, and pure hue is actually very rare. The Crocosmia 'Dusky Maiden' has exactly this mix of orange, russet and green with a patina of purple that all adds up to a rich bronze. We only planted it this spring and it is already an important element in the Jewel garden. </p> <p> Lysimachia ciliata 'Firecracker' is another plant that works very well in this colour range, although in a very different way. It takes up quite a lot of space but develops from a chocolaty purple in high summer, dotted with small gold flowers, to a much bronzer cast by late summer. It is never a star in the way sunflowers or heleniums are, but it is a particularly trouble-free plant and adds a permanently rich colour dimension to a border throughout a long season. Another plant with the same shade of leaf is Rodgersia pinnata 'Superba', while the plantain Plantago major 'Rubrifolia' is as bronze as the Lysimachia and Rodgersia . </p> <p>We have a few clumps of Echinacea purpurea in the Jewel garden which, at first, seems an unlikely contender, given that the mauvey-pink petals are wildly outside the thematic parameters of strong jewel colours. But the petals tend to hang down giving the cones prominence, and the combination of the rose/purple and the russety orange cones makes a distinctly coppery mix. More striking is the combination or the seed heads and stems of the orache Atriplex hortensis var. rubra. Each 10ft plant has thousands of seeds that spread at the tiniest rustle. In September, they turn a Naples yellow and the stems remain burgundy purple, and that combination again makes a coppery bronze. I was clearing a patch yesterday that had fallen down, and ended up with seeds in all sorts of interesting places. </p> <p>We have trouble getting bronze fennel to overwinter with anything like the same enthusiasm as its green cousin, so sow lots of it each year to replace the inevitable losses. It is worth the trouble because the unfolding plumes of foliage are a superb bronze in spring and early summer. </p> <p>Although there are very few true bronze or copper flowers, one of the best exceptions to this rule is the iris - many of which are suffused with copper and bronze, although none will be in flower now. Nevertheless, Iris 'Autumn leaves', I 'Adobe Sunset', I 'Brindisi', I 'Gingerbread Man' and I 'Blue-eyed Brunette' are all really strong metallic additions to the border. </p> <p>Our tree peonies, Paeonia delavayi, a rusty bronze, are modest to the point of retiring, but I adore them and look forward to their appearance every May with real eagerness. They are a private, intimate pleasure, as are all the best of flowers. At about the same time, the Euphorbia griffithii 'Dixter' picks up the same tone of rusty copper, but with more flamboyance. </p> <p>But the whole garden is flushed with intense, new green when the irises, peonies and euphorbias are out. That is last season's history and the reality of the garden now is that it is dying quietly on the vine. Of all the grasses, Miscanthus sinensis 'Malepartus' is relishing the hour as gloriously as anything. As the plumes open, they gather in an extraordinary concertina of zigzags before becoming bronzed, plum-feathered pennants. We planted our first one three years ago now and it has established as a really strong clump that will last well into autumn. </p> <p>If you think that it is stretching things too far to call M 'Malepartus' bronze, there can be no argument with M Nepalensis, which is always described as gold but is actually more a brassy colour and is ravishingly beautiful. The best-known bronze grass is Carex comans 'Bronze Form', which is certainly worth a place for its structure as well as the colour, and tolerates quite deep shade. We grow a couple at the base of the aforementioned tree peonies, and the relationship is flourishing. Carex buchananii, which is similar but has charming wiggly bits to the ends of its leaves, is a good and useful component of the metallic kit, as is Carex flagellifera, with a more ginger tint to it than C comans, which it resembles. </p> <p>Finally, the most important bronze and copper influence in our Jewel garden only starts to come into effect in a week or two's time, which is the turning of the hornbeam hedge that surrounds it. Like beech, hornbeam keeps its leaves for most of the winter, turning a lovely russety colour that dominates the garden and restores my faith in brown as a colour to be lived with. If I am honest, I did not fully weigh the importance of this when I planned the garden, but it has a huge influence on the garden for half the year.</p> <p><strong>My roots: A week in Monty's garden </strong></p> <p>It is apple season in this the appliest of all British counties and I have spent a lot of time in the past week identifying the apples in our orchard. If I had kept a proper record of what was planted where when I did it, I would not have had to do this. But I didn't. </p> <p>Of course, when you are planting anything, you think you'll remember - but you never do. It is one of the first rules of gardening: label everything clearly when you plant or sow it. We have 41 apple trees in the orchard, with two of five varieties (William Crump, Blenheim Orange, Worcester Pearmain, Herefordshire Beefing and Bramley's Seedling). That makes 36 different varieties, of which about a dozen are quite rare and very specific to this area. I had properly labelled about a dozen, about a dozen were unlabelled and - worst of all - a dozen were inaccurately labelled. So, effectively, I had to identify two dozen varieties.</p> <p>Luckily, the trainspotter in me comes willingly forward when it comes to apples. I love the fruit and the trees equally and really enjoyed the detective work involved on the internet, in the library and going through my own records.</p> <p>Funnily enough, I have a vivid memory of writing the garden diary a couple of years ago having planted six apple trees. I was dog-tired, and knew I was putting the wrong varieties down. I didn't bother to check them - which would have meant taking a torch and going up to the orchard in the rain - promising myself that I'd do so in the morning - but I never did.</p> <p>The job is not entirely done. I have yet to identify 'Dr Hare's' and 'Devonshire Buckland' - the only record of which I can find on a French pomona on the internet, with no description. If anyone can enlighten or help me either via this newspaper or directly to montydon@btclick I should be very grateful.</p> <p>The trees are very young but we are still getting dozens and dozens of apples. Knowing where and how to store them is a problem. A dedicated apple store seems to me a lovely thing and I am tempted to build one. It need not be much bigger than the chicken shed, and as long as it was frost-free and dry, could be very simple. It would be a kind of grown-up wendy house, dressed in the solemnity of a purpose. I can smell it now, that slightly musty, cidery tang that stored apples with crinkly skins give off, each variety in its own rack or shelf, all labelled but slightly scruffy. Bit like the orchard itself.</p> <p><strong>Your roots: Tasks to complete before the frost sets in </strong></p> <p>October is an important month in the garden because almost anything can be planted or moved without harm. Although conventionally a little early, I find it a particularly good time for planting deciduous hedges and trees. </p> <p>Raise the blades of the lawnmower and, even if the weather is good, resist the temptation to cut your grass too low. Grass continues to grow if the weather doesn't drop below 5 C, but must be allowed to get longer over winter to protect roots.</p> <p>Watch out for ground frosts. An overnight layer of horticultural fleece over vegetables, flowers or even small trees is usually enough to stop any damage at this time of year.</p> <p>If you have any ground to dig or clear, do it now. Mix plenty of manure or compost in as you dig and leave dug soil in large clods; the weather will break it down into a fine tilth by next spring.</p>",

Rudbeckia hirta is grown as an annual (although it is actually biennial or even perennial in the right conditions) and 'Gloriosa Daisy Mix' has rich, orangey-copper tones, as does 'Rustic Dwarfs', although this might include the odd truly yellow flower which, in a fit of puritanical zeal to retain metallic status, can be smartly snipped off. Again and again, as you look closely at flowers, you see that it is the combination of colours that makes colour effects, and pure hue is actually very rare. The Crocosmia 'Dusky Maiden' has exactly this mix of orange, russet and green with a patina of purple that all adds up to a rich bronze. We only planted it this spring and it is already an important element in the Jewel garden. Lysimachia ciliata 'Firecracker' is another plant that works very well in this colour range, although in a very different way. It takes up quite a lot of space but develops from a chocolaty purple in high summer, dotted with small gold flowers, to a much bronzer cast by late summer. It is never a star in the way sunflowers or heleniums are, but it is a particularly trouble-free plant and adds a permanently rich colour dimension to a border throughout a long season. Another plant with the same shade of leaf is Rodgersia pinnata 'Superba', while the plantain Plantago major 'Rubrifolia' is as bronze as the Lysimachia and Rodgersia . We have a few clumps of Echinacea purpurea in the Jewel garden which, at first, seems an unlikely contender, given that the mauvey-pink petals are wildly outside the thematic parameters of strong jewel colours. But the petals tend to hang down giving the cones prominence, and the combination of the rose/purple and the russety orange cones makes a distinctly coppery mix. More striking is the combination or the seed heads and stems of the orache Atriplex hortensis var. rubra. Each 10ft plant has thousands of seeds that spread at the tiniest rustle. In September, they turn a Naples yellow and the stems remain burgundy purple, and that combination again makes a coppery bronze. I was clearing a patch yesterday that had fallen down, and ended up with seeds in all sorts of interesting places. We have trouble getting bronze fennel to overwinter with anything like the same enthusiasm as its green cousin, so sow lots of it each year to replace the inevitable losses. It is worth the trouble because the unfolding plumes of foliage are a superb bronze in spring and early summer. Although there are very few true bronze or copper flowers, one of the best exceptions to this rule is the iris - many of which are suffused with copper and bronze, although none will be in flower now. Nevertheless, Iris 'Autumn leaves', I 'Adobe Sunset', I 'Brindisi', I 'Gingerbread Man' and I 'Blue-eyed Brunette' are all really strong metallic additions to the border. Our tree peonies, Paeonia delavayi, a rusty bronze, are modest to the point of retiring, but I adore them and look forward to their appearance every May with real eagerness. They are a private, intimate pleasure, as are all the best of flowers. At about the same time, the Euphorbia griffithii 'Dixter' picks up the same tone of rusty copper, but with more flamboyance. But the whole garden is flushed with intense, new green when the irises, peonies and euphorbias are out. That is last season's history and the reality of the garden now is that it is dying quietly on the vine. Of all the grasses, Miscanthus sinensis 'Malepartus' is relishing the hour as gloriously as anything. As the plumes open, they gather in an extraordinary concertina of zigzags before becoming bronzed, plum-feathered pennants. We planted our first one three years ago now and it has established as a really strong clump that will last well into autumn. If you think that it is stretching things too far to call M 'Malepartus' bronze, there can be no argument with M Nepalensis, which is always described as gold but is actually more a brassy colour and is ravishingly beautiful. The best-known bronze grass is Carex comans 'Bronze Form', which is certainly worth a place for its structure as well as the colour, and tolerates quite deep shade. We grow a couple at the base of the aforementioned tree peonies, and the relationship is flourishing. Carex buchananii, which is similar but has charming wiggly bits to the ends of its leaves, is a good and useful component of the metallic kit, as is Carex flagellifera, with a more ginger tint to it than C comans, which it resembles. Finally, the most important bronze and copper influence in our Jewel garden only starts to come into effect in a week or two's time, which is the turning of the hornbeam hedge that surrounds it. Like beech, hornbeam keeps its leaves for most of the winter, turning a lovely russety colour that dominates the garden and restores my faith in brown as a colour to be lived with. If I am honest, I did not fully weigh the importance of this when I planned the garden, but it has a huge influence on the garden for half the year. My roots: A week in Monty's garden It is apple season in this the appliest of all British counties and I have spent a lot of time in the past week identifying the apples in our orchard. If I had kept a proper record of what was planted where when I did it, I would not have had to do this. But I didn't. Of course, when you are planting anything, you think you'll remember - but you never do. It is one of the first rules of gardening: label everything clearly when you plant or sow it. We have 41 apple trees in the orchard, with two of five varieties (William Crump, Blenheim Orange, Worcester Pearmain, Herefordshire Beefing and Bramley's Seedling). That makes 36 different varieties, of which about a dozen are quite rare and very specific to this area. I had properly labelled about a dozen, about a dozen were unlabelled and - worst of all - a dozen were inaccurately labelled. So, effectively, I had to identify two dozen varieties. Luckily, the trainspotter in me comes willingly forward when it comes to apples. I love the fruit and the trees equally and really enjoyed the detective work involved on the internet, in the library and going through my own records. Funnily enough, I have a vivid memory of writing the garden diary a couple of years ago having planted six apple trees. I was dog-tired, and knew I was putting the wrong varieties down. I didn't bother to check them - which would have meant taking a torch and going up to the orchard in the rain - promising myself that I'd do so in the morning - but I never did. The job is not entirely done. I have yet to identify 'Dr Hare's' and 'Devonshire Buckland' - the only record of which I can find on a French pomona on the internet, with no description. If anyone can enlighten or help me either via this newspaper or directly to montydon@btclick I should be very grateful. The trees are very young but we are still getting dozens and dozens of apples. Knowing where and how to store them is a problem. A dedicated apple store seems to me a lovely thing and I am tempted to build one. It need not be much bigger than the chicken shed, and as long as it was frost-free and dry, could be very simple. It would be a kind of grown-up wendy house, dressed in the solemnity of a purpose. I can smell it now, that slightly musty, cidery tang that stored apples with crinkly skins give off, each variety in its own rack or shelf, all labelled but slightly scruffy. Bit like the orchard itself. Your roots: Tasks to complete before the frost sets in October is an important month in the garden because almost anything can be planted or moved without harm. Although conventionally a little early, I find it a particularly good time for planting deciduous hedges and trees. Raise the blades of the lawnmower and, even if the weather is good, resist the temptation to cut your grass too low. Grass continues to grow if the weather doesn't drop below 5 C, but must be allowed to get longer over winter to protect roots. Watch out for ground frosts. An overnight layer of horticultural fleece over vegetables, flowers or even small trees is usually enough to stop any damage at this time of year. If you have any ground to dig or clear, do it now. Mix plenty of manure or compost in as you dig and leave dug soil in large clods; the weather will break it down into a fine tilth by next spring.",

      "body": "<p>Mandy Evans last saw her son alive on 12 January 1995, just after 7am. They were in the Bristol Royal Infirmary, and 16-month-old Joshua, already asleep from his pre-med, was being prepared for 'arterial switch' cardiac surgery. Put at its most basic, the major arteries in Joshua's heart were positioned incorrectly, and would have to be 'switched' around. The surgeon assigned to carry out the intricate operation was Janardan Dhasmana. </p> <p>Unbeknown to Mandy, and her partner and Joshua's father, Bert Loveday, Dhasmana's survival rate for these operations was well below the national average. So far below that, on the evening before Joshua's operation, a secret eleventh-hour crisis meeting was held at the hospital. </p> <p>It was decided that the operation would go ahead. By the following afternoon, Joshua was dead. His case sparked public uproar and served as a catalyst for a far-reaching inquiry into the deaths and brain damage of scores of children who'd passed through Bristol, stretching as far back as 1984. In 1997, James Wisheart, the department head, was struck off the register by the General Medical Council. Dhasmana was suspended from operating upon children for three years. </p> <p>Even though she had given evidence to the GMC, Mandy gleaned cold comfort from these reprisals - her child was still dead. Before long, her partner was also dead. Haunted by his son's death, Bert Loveday became progressively more depressed and disoriented. Before, the biggest trouble Bert ever got into was over parking offences. After, he participated in an armed robbery. He gave himself up, and got three years, hanging himself in his cell a little over a month into his sentence. He was one of four 'Bristol parents' to commit suicide. </p> <p>On that January morning, waiting with Bert and their other son, Luke, then two, for Joshua to go into theatre, Mandy wasn't aware of either the drama of the previous evening's meeting or the tragedy and recriminations to come. She just had this 'gut feeling'. When the surgical staff tried to wheel Joshua away, she clung on to the trolley and, weeping hysterically, refused to let go. Mandy says now: 'I wanted to pick Josh up, asleep or not, and take him home. I couldn't let go of the bed, they had to pull me away.' </p> <p>As they finally led her son away, Mandy remembers being transfixed by the expression on the face of one of hospital staff. 'It wasn't blank, it was like fear. If I read it now, he was saying to me, \"What are you doing? Take him away.\" </p> <p>'But he didn't actually say anything. Nobody said anything. It was all just looks without words. If the words had come, just one word, just one note, we'd have picked up Joshua, and we'd have been gone.' </p> <p>Talking in a London hotel room, Mandy occasionally breaks down during the telling of her story, bowing her head, until her hair forms a shield around her face. However, for the most part, she is composed and eloquent, blessed - or cursed, depending on your view - with total recall. It is harrowing to listen to her account of that long, dreadful day which would have such tragic repercussions for her family. As Joshua had been doing so well, the Lovedays were surprised when Bristol brought forward his switch operation, but they had faith in Dhasmana. </p> <p>'He seemed very confident and capable,' says Mandy. 'We needed to trust him. He had control over our son's life, over all our lives. He was a God figure.' </p> <p>Late on the night before the operation, the Lovedays saw Dhasmana. He'd come straight from the fateful meeting, but no mention was made of that. He apologised for being late, saying he'd been 'on his rounds', and asked them to sign the consent form. Unlike some of the other parents involved in the Bristol case, the Lovedays did ask questions. </p> <p>'Bert was good like that,' says Mandy. 'He didn't say a lot, but if he had anything to say, he said it straight. That night, Bert asked Dhasmana the same question he always had, \"Can you do it?\" </p> <p>In so many words, Dhasmana said that it wasn't a simple operation, but he'd done enough of them to know what he was doing.' Bert signed. </p> <p>When the nurse came to tell the Lovedays that Joshua had died, Mandy can only remember crying 'Oh my God!' continuously. Dhasmana arrived, still in his greens, with tears in his eyes. Mandy couldn't bear to look at him: 'I knew what he'd just been doing,' she says. 'My son's blood was still on him.' Loveday shook Dhasmana's hand, and said: 'It's all right, mate, you did your best.' Mandy said Bert never mentioned that again afterwards. 'He could never talk about how he'd said thanks.' </p> <p>Dhasmana might have done 'his' best but, although it appears that certain children who died at Bristol would probably have died anywhere, in a more able surgeon's hands Joshua's was a far from hopeless case. Mandy is haunted by the fact that their son could have survived, tortured by all the 'if onlys'. </p> <p>'What finished Bert off was the fact that he signed that consent form. For me, it's having the gut feeling that I should take Josh and run, but not doing it.' </p> <p>However, it was only when she was alerted by a television documentary researcher investigating the Bristol scandal that the jigsaw started to fall into place. The 'looks' from staff. The junior nurse sobbing in the corridor. The fob-offs. The inquest that never happened. The way, the day Joshua died, the hospital briefly gave them his body wrapped up in blankets in a Moses basket. 'At the time I didn't know that the operation had taken so long, his chest cavity was still open.' Mandy feels that Joshua's operation went ahead despite serious misgivings because: 'The hospital wanted to prove they could do it.' </p> <p>She saw Dhasmana at the GMC hearing: 'He was within touching distance. I wanted to hit him. He was so pompous and arrogant. When I gave evidence, he kept shaking his head as if to say, \"Nonsense, nonsense.\" ' </p> <p>She is slightly dismissive of Steve Bolsin, the Bristol anaesthetist who finally blew the whistle. 'If I met him, I'd shake his hand, but there's a part of me that thinks he's just as bad as the rest. They all knew what was going on, but nobody said anything. A note, just one note, is all it would have took.' </p> <p>These days, Mandy is coping as best she can. At times, the memories make her physically ill. When she was getting ready to go out recently, her other son, Luke, asked who would look after him if she didn't come back, if she died. As Joshua was one of the children whose heart Bristol retained, she also has to deal with that. </p> <p>'All I want is peace of mind,' says Mandy wearily, the coffee beside her sitting cold and untouched in its cup. 'But I can never have that without Bert and Josh. All I've got is Luke - we keep each other going.'</p>",

      "body": "<p> Europe 2010. Picture the world's e-commerce desert. The global rust belt. The capital of unemployment. After a decade starved of investment as capital has ploughed westward to the high-growth, high-productivity US, Europe is facing its greatest crisis since the mid-twentieth century. </p> <p>With unemployment at 15 per cent, the Italian far right sweeps to victory in elections on a single issue: leaving the euro, and killing the 11-year experiment in monetary union which has impoverished the country. The victory address begins: 'Since the Danes rejected it in 2000, this has clearly been a false union... </p> <p>An absurdity, of course. But for the Continent's more entrenched euro enemies, such an outcome would be a delightful conclusion flowing from the Danish rejection of the single currency in last week's referendum. </p> <p>And it makes a point which is lost in the fallout from the Danish no vote: that a successful Europe will be judged by its ability to grow, to invest in its future and to create employment - in short to compete with the soaraway US. The single currency is intended to be a milestone on that road. </p> <p>The impact on Danish voters of the euro's failure to deliver, demonstrated by its weakness against the dollar and its failure to attract investment, is difficult to unravel. More important, and equally unclear, is the impact of the Danish decision on the ability of Europe to reinvigorate its economy to challenge the US.</p> <p> In the short term, although the Danish central bank had to raise its interest rates by half of one per cent, the immediate effect on the euro itself was negligible. It fell slightly to 87.9 cents. </p> <p>There were several reasons for this. From the market's perspective a 'no' vote was widely expected. Currency traders were, in any case, nervous of selling the euro because of the concerted intervention by central banks to keep it above 85 cents nine days ago.</p> <p> If the intervention does not work and the euro slumps below that level, there will be serious questions about its future. The longer-term questions are political as well as economic. </p> <p> Janet Bush, of the pro-EU but anti- single currency group New Europe, says: 'There are two views about the Danish vote: it could speed up integration and reform in the euro zone - and the logic of that would be that the euro will be more stable. </p> <p>'Or, if the reaction to the Danish vote is that people all over Europe who have been worried about the currency start to balk at intervention, the whole thing looks rather worse. I suspect the latter is the more likely case.' </p> <p>Some City economists believe that regardless of the determination to press ahead by the euro core, the currency will remain weaker than the dollar for some time, and the dollar will continue to attract more investment because this is reflected in the economic fundamentals. </p> <p>US growth over the past year has been 6 per cent; euroland's was 3.8 per cent. American unemployment is around 4 per cent, compared with 9.1 per cent in euroland. Wage and consumer inflation are about 1 per cent higher in the US, which is still manageable. </p> <p>Philip Chitty of ABN Amro, a former Treasury economist, says: 'The underlying issue and the reason why the euro is not going to strengthen is that fundamentally it is a weak currency.' </p> <p>A key factor is the composition of the capital flow to the US - which underpins the dollar's strength. The European Central Bank vice-president, Christian Noyer, has blamed the euro's problems on speculators shifting short-term portfolio capital, such as stock market investments , to the US.</p> <p> The speculators' fun was halted by the intervention. The argument for such action is that further well timed moves by central banks could change what is simply short-term sentiment about the euro and turn the tide against the dollar. </p> <p>However, Chitty and others believe that the flight of short-term capital is a sign of a bigger problem: investors throwing in the towel because of the return on European assets, which have suffered because of long-term capital flowing out into, among other things, US businesses and factories. </p> <p>Last year \u20ac200 billion of capital left the EU, and around \u20ac55bn came in. Some \u20ac40bn of the outflow went to the US from Germany alone. </p> <p>Compounding the issue is the fact that although there have also been euroland inflows, such as Vodafone's \u00a3103bn acquisition of Mannesman, these have tended to be paid in paper, so they have little impact on the currency. </p> <p>The massive long-term investment has underpinned the dollar's long-term rise and helped to create long-term conditions - such as higher productivity - to continue to attract investment. </p> <p> In addition, long-term investment into the US accounts for 40 per cent of its current account deficit. An ABN Amro currency analyst says: 'There is a contention that the dollar will fall because of the deficit. Whether or not this is true, the currency it will not be falling against is the euro, [because it is in the single currency area] where 12 per cent of its deficit is held. It is more likely to fall against the yen, because 60 per cent of the deficit is in Asia.'</p> <p> Adair Turner, former director-general of the Confederation of British Industry and now a director of the pro-euro Business for Sterling campaign, plays down the importance of these figures.</p> <p> 'At the end of the Eighties, people were writing books saying the extent of Japanese investment in the US was worrying,' says Turner. 'Now they are saying the ability of the US to attract investment is a virtue. It all depends on fashions of the time.' </p> <p> If, however, investment flows do matter in the long term, then the ability of euroland to project itself as a booming economy competing with the dollar is paramount. This in turn depends on the ability of the EU 11 single currency member states to forge ahead to closer integration and reform, as French Finance Minister Laurent Fabius has been insisting.</p> <p> The euro's credibility is important to this process and, as UK sceptics such as Bush point out, the Danish referendum result was not a good start. However, Turner, who freely admits he would like to have seen a Yes vote, says a Danish 'no' vote does not alter the fundamentals of eurozone growth, inflation, employ ment, trade and so on. 'If we were talking about a country like France deciding not to join a currency comprising, say, Belgium, Portugal and Ireland, the impact would be dramatic. But Denmark composes about 2.1 per cent of eurozone GDP. That's small.' </p> <p>The UK, however, is another matter. The EU's bravado after Friday's vote will be more difficult to carry off if Britain or Sweden vote 'no', too. </p> <p>Turner argues that there is no reason why the Danish 'no' should lead to a similar result in this country. Floating sterling makes economic arguments of utmost importance.

      "bodyText": "Europe 2010. Picture the world's e-commerce desert. The global rust belt. The capital of unemployment. After a decade starved of investment as capital has ploughed westward to the high-growth, high-productivity US, Europe is facing its greatest crisis since the mid-twentieth century. With unemployment at 15 per cent, the Italian far right sweeps to victory in elections on a single issue: leaving the euro, and killing the 11-year experiment in monetary union which has impoverished the country. The victory address begins: 'Since the Danes rejected it in 2000, this has clearly been a false union... An absurdity, of course. But for the Continent's more entrenched euro enemies, such an outcome would be a delightful conclusion flowing from the Danish rejection of the single currency in last week's referendum. And it makes a point which is lost in the fallout from the Danish no vote: that a successful Europe will be judged by its ability to grow, to invest in its future and to create employment - in short to compete with the soaraway US. The single currency is intended to be a milestone on that road. The impact on Danish voters of the euro's failure to deliver, demonstrated by its weakness against the dollar and its failure to attract investment, is difficult to unravel. More important, and equally unclear, is the impact of the Danish decision on the ability of Europe to reinvigorate its economy to challenge the US. In the short term, although the Danish central bank had to raise its interest rates by half of one per cent, the immediate effect on the euro itself was negligible. It fell slightly to 87.9 cents. There were several reasons for this. From the market's perspective a 'no' vote was widely expected. Currency traders were, in any case, nervous of selling the euro because of the concerted intervention by central banks to keep it above 85 cents nine days ago. If the intervention does not work and the euro slumps below that level, there will be serious questions about its future. The longer-term questions are political as well as economic. Janet Bush, of the pro-EU but anti- single currency group New Europe, says: 'There are two views about the Danish vote: it could speed up integration and reform in the euro zone - and the logic of that would be that the euro will be more stable. 'Or, if the reaction to the Danish vote is that people all over Europe who have been worried about the currency start to balk at intervention, the whole thing looks rather worse. I suspect the latter is the more likely case.' Some City economists believe that regardless of the determination to press ahead by the euro core, the currency will remain weaker than the dollar for some time, and the dollar will continue to attract more investment because this is reflected in the economic fundamentals. US growth over the past year has been 6 per cent; euroland's was 3.8 per cent. American unemployment is around 4 per cent, compared with 9.1 per cent in euroland. Wage and consumer inflation are about 1 per cent higher in the US, which is still manageable. Philip Chitty of ABN Amro, a former Treasury economist, says: 'The underlying issue and the reason why the euro is not going to strengthen is that fundamentally it is a weak currency.' A key factor is the composition of the capital flow to the US - which underpins the dollar's strength. The European Central Bank vice-president, Christian Noyer, has blamed the euro's problems on speculators shifting short-term portfolio capital, such as stock market investments , to the US. The speculators' fun was halted by the intervention. The argument for such action is that further well timed moves by central banks could change what is simply short-term sentiment about the euro and turn the tide against the dollar. However, Chitty and others believe that the flight of short-term capital is a sign of a bigger problem: investors throwing in the towel because of the return on European assets, which have suffered because of long-term capital flowing out into, among other things, US businesses and factories. Last year \u20ac200 billion of capital left the EU, and around \u20ac55bn came in. Some \u20ac40bn of the outflow went to the US from Germany alone. Compounding the issue is the fact that although there have also been euroland inflows, such as Vodafone's \u00a3103bn acquisition of Mannesman, these have tended to be paid in paper, so they have little impact on the currency. The massive long-term investment has underpinned the dollar's long-term rise and helped to create long-term conditions - such as higher productivity - to continue to attract investment. In addition, long-term investment into the US accounts for 40 per cent of its current account deficit. An ABN Amro currency analyst says: 'There is a contention that the dollar will fall because of the deficit. Whether or not this is true, the currency it will not be falling against is the euro, [because it is in the single currency area] where 12 per cent of its deficit is held. It is more likely to fall against the yen, because 60 per cent of the deficit is in Asia.' Adair Turner, former director-general of the Confederation of British Industry and now a director of the pro-euro Business for Sterling campaign, plays down the importance of these figures. 'At the end of the Eighties, people were writing books saying the extent of Japanese investment in the US was worrying,' says Turner. 'Now they are saying the ability of the US to attract investment is a virtue. It all depends on fashions of the time.' If, however, investment flows do matter in the long term, then the ability of euroland to project itself as a booming economy competing with the dollar is paramount. This in turn depends on the ability of the EU 11 single currency member states to forge ahead to closer integration and reform, as French Finance Minister Laurent Fabius has been insisting. The euro's credibility is important to this process and, as UK sceptics such as Bush point out, the Danish referendum result was not a good start. However, Turner, who freely admits he would like to have seen a Yes vote, says a Danish 'no' vote does not alter the fundamentals of eurozone growth, inflation, employ ment, trade and so on. 'If we were talking about a country like France deciding not to join a currency comprising, say, Belgium, Portugal and Ireland, the impact would be dramatic. But Denmark composes about 2.1 per cent of eurozone GDP. That's small.' The UK, however, is another matter. The EU's bravado after Friday's vote will be more difficult to carry off if Britain or Sweden vote 'no', too. Turner argues that there is no reason why the Danish 'no' should lead to a similar result in this country. Floating sterling makes economic arguments of utmost importance. They are not detrimental to the case for membership, as they were in Denmark, which had little to gain in that way. The political arguments in Denmark rested on a diametrically opposite view of euroland taxation policy to those advanced by UK sceptics. Danes believe taxes in the currency club are so low that they threaten the future of the Danish welfare state. The British 'no' side says they are too high, forcing the UK to fund bureaucracy and waste. However, these differences are unlikely to impress Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, who will now surely be scaling back their ambitions to hold an early referendum on UK entry. But a failure by Britain to enter the euro in the foreseeable future would have a far bigger effect than Denmark's vote. The UK would add 17 per cent to the euroland GDP, not a mere 2.1 per cent, and that rejection would be from a nation of 58 million, not just 5 million. It is far more likely that our fictional Italian fascist would point to that fact in 2010, rather than to the Danish 'no'.",

      "body": "<p>For a group united by euro-scepticism, they had a new and unlikely hero. As the hundred local business men and women gathered in Leeds for the dinner of the Yorkshire arm of Business for Sterling on Friday night, the mood was jubilant.</p> <p>Ruth Lea, the noted right-wing head of policy at the Institute of Directors, spoke of the dangers of Europe. And then came the toast to the euro-sceptics' new found friends: 'Well done the Danes!' Everyone cheered: 'The Danes!'</p> <p>'People were very upbeat' said Nick Herbert, the director of Business for Sterling. 'The Danish vote was the culmination of a series of events. We're going from strength to strength.'</p> <p>Europe is back on the centre stage. The Danes vote no to joining the euro and Britain trembles. For the eurosceptics it is part of a continuum. There are increasing mutterings in Germany that the political establishment is rushing towards federalism with little regard for what the public thinks. German polls show a majority against the euro, but the government decided that they did not need a referendum before joining.</p> <p>In Biarritz in mid-October an informal meeting of the European Council will again raise the temperature. It is the scene setter for the key Nice Summit in December, which will see fresh battles over European Union enlargement, the controversial charter of rights and two-speed Europe. France, which has the presidency of the European Union, is struggling with its own internal scandals of kick-backs and slush funds which go to the heart of the Republic.</p> <p>In Italy, euroscepticism is on the march. When Romano Prodi, the rotund President of the European Commission, fell off his bike during the summer holidays the Italian press had a field day. Anti-Europeans took glee in stating that Prodi's mishap was a metaphor for the continental project: wobbly, prone to accidents and often exposed to public ridicule. Italy feels sidelined, with opposition parties saying that economic problems are being exacerbated by European rules.</p> <p>When Tony Blair arrives in Warsaw on Thursday night it will be for one of the most important statements on Europe of his premiership. His speech on Friday has to be heard above all the euro-sceptic noise.</p> <p>The preparation has been meticulous. In a briefing to journalists before the summer holidays, Alastair Campbell, the Prime Minister's official spokesman, let slip that Blair was preparing 'something big' on Europe for the autumn. Campbell would not be pushed further, but it was clear that it was such a significant move that he was turning his mind to it months ago.</p> <p>Last month the rumour mill started in earnest. Keith Vaz, the Minister for Europe, told colleagues that he had seen 'the third draft' of this 'most important speech'. David Clark, Robin Cook's special adviser on European affairs, was brought in to help. What would be the right tone? How could the Prime Minister enthuse a jaded public? Blair has been casting widely for the correct approach.</p> <p>On Friday, Roger Liddle was not taking many calls. For much of the day Downing Street's European expert was locked in meetings as the final touches were added to Blair's speech. Liddle will be expected to set the right parameters for the debate.</p> <p>The Prime Minister's speech will be the big set-piece event on Europe of the autumn, designed to blow the Conservative Party conference's sceptical stance off the agenda.</p> <p>Blair will take a new line. We all know the tired phrases of being for the European single currency in principle as long as the five economic tests are met. But government sources were suggesting this weekend that far from concentrating on Gordon Brown's iron laws, the Prime Minister will make a more philosophical speech, a political rallying cry about why Britain must be at the centre of Europe.</p> <p>He will talk about democracy, the need to make Europe more responsive to the nation states it is supposed to serve.</p> <p>He will launch an idea of an elected second chamber to work alongside the European Parliament. He will talk of his desire to bring home the European project, make it relevant, make the continent come alive. He will talk about enlargement and the new brotherhood of nations. At the Labour Party conference last week Peter Mandelson, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the Cabinet's leading pro-European, argued that a more political case needed to be made for Europe, away from the desiccated words of economics. Blair has taken heed.</p> <p>Robin Cook, the Foreign Secretary, also knows of the need for action. He flew back from a meeting of European Socialist leaders in Brussels late last Thursday evening to a slew of negative headlines. He was advised to do the 'full run' of interviews the next morning, to lead the Government charge against those who say that the Danish vote will simply strengthen the negative feelings about Europe.</p> <p>On Friday morning Sky, the Today programme, BBC Breakfast, Radio 5 Live and ITN turned up at 1 Carlton Gardens, Cook's official residence in London, and were ushered in for interviews.</p> <p>Cook's line - agreed months earlier with Sir Stephen Wall, the Cabinet Office's European policy enforcer, Nigel Sheinwald, the ambassador in Brussels, and Kim Darroch, the British director of the European Union - was that the Danish vote had little effect on the British debate.</p> <p>But many of Blair's allies are not so sure. For Ken Jackson, the most outspoken pro-euro trade union leader and a member of the board of the pro-Europe Britain in Europe, there are problems ahead. He was phoned at home on Thursday evening with the Danish results.</p> <p>'Politically, it does have implications,' Jackson said. 'It serves as a warning that the pro-euro campaign can't rely on a grand-coalition and rely on the people to believe what you say. It's a wake-up call to do the campaigning.'</p> <p>The question now is the effect the Danish vote will have on Blair's enthusiasm for a referendum on whether Britain should join the euro during the next parliament. The Prime Minister, one senior adviser explained last week, is a '70-30 man'. If he doesn't believe he will win an issue overwhelmingly, he will not risk it. So the British referendum is in danger of being kicked into the long grass.</p> <p>Labour strategists are aware that the major problem will be time. Governments win referendums at the beginning of parliaments when there is less danger of them turning into plebiscites on their more general performance. If the public's mood does not fundamentally change over the next year, Blair is unlikely to pile into a referendum which, if lost, would be politically disastrous. There are elephant traps ahead. At the end of the year the hundreds of politicians and bureaucrats who will descend on Nice will have three major issues to fight over: enlargement (the inclusion of Poland, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary and Slovenia into the EU), the growth of a two-speed Europe; and the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p> <p>All have their European downside. Enlargement introduces weaker eastern European currencies to the euro, which is likely to increase speculator pressure on a currency now bouncing along at historically low levels.</p> <p>'Two-speed Europe' is a phrase that Blair, determined to be at the centre of things, hates. But its supporters are becoming more and more vociferous. At the weekend, signals from Berlin and Paris were that 'reinforced co-operation' would be high on the Nice agenda. It will allow certain countries, led by Germany and France, to continue towards greater integration.</p> <p>Finally, the Charter of Fundamental Rights has become embroiled in arguments about a European super-state bouncing national governments into agreements on workers' and citizens' rights. Originally, the charter was supposed to be a broad, somewhat vague, document similar to the Human Rights Act in Britain. But then the bureaucrats got hold of it and it became an overlong administrative document, with detailed proposals on workplace rules. The Government is concerned that a new charter more binding than a simple 'declaration' will confuse the rights issue.</p> <p>The problems are piling up and the pro-European argument is struggling. Analysts admit that it is difficult to see what tricks can be pulled out of the PR bag to change the tide of public opinion. Business leaders, such as the head of Nissan, keep saying that being outside the euro is damaging British manufacturing. They said it again at the end of last week. Once such words would make the front page lead in the Financial Times . On Thursday the story was relegated to page 2. Nissan are shouting in a vacuum.</p> <p>Pro-euro campaigners hope that the circulation of euro notes from January 2002 might have an effect, showing the public how the currency works in reality. But even that optimism is tinged with a fear that it could also show that Britain can remain outside the euro with few problems.</p> <p>Influential City economist Roger Bootle has already been advising his powerful blue-chip clients that they should assume Britain will stay out of the euro for 10 years. Many in the Treasury, who argue the health service and education are bigger priorities, agree.</p> <p>Over the din of toasts to 'the Danes!' up and down the country, Blair will struggle to be heard.</p> <p>Links:<a href=\"http://www.denmark.org.uk/politics.htm\" target=\"_NEW\">www.denmark.org.uk</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "For a group united by euro-scepticism, they had a new and unlikely hero. As the hundred local business men and women gathered in Leeds for the dinner of the Yorkshire arm of Business for Sterling on Friday night, the mood was jubilant. Ruth Lea, the noted right-wing head of policy at the Institute of Directors, spoke of the dangers of Europe. And then came the toast to the euro-sceptics' new found friends: 'Well done the Danes!' Everyone cheered: 'The Danes!' 'People were very upbeat' said Nick Herbert, the director of Business for Sterling. 'The Danish vote was the culmination of a series of events. We're going from strength to strength.' Europe is back on the centre stage. The Danes vote no to joining the euro and Britain trembles. For the eurosceptics it is part of a continuum. There are increasing mutterings in Germany that the political establishment is rushing towards federalism with little regard for what the public thinks. German polls show a majority against the euro, but the government decided that they did not need a referendum before joining. In Biarritz in mid-October an informal meeting of the European Council will again raise the temperature. It is the scene setter for the key Nice Summit in December, which will see fresh battles over European Union enlargement, the controversial charter of rights and two-speed Europe. France, which has the presidency of the European Union, is struggling with its own internal scandals of kick-backs and slush funds which go to the heart of the Republic. In Italy, euroscepticism is on the march. When Romano Prodi, the rotund President of the European Commission, fell off his bike during the summer holidays the Italian press had a field day. Anti-Europeans took glee in stating that Prodi's mishap was a metaphor for the continental project: wobbly, prone to accidents and often exposed to public ridicule. Italy feels sidelined, with opposition parties saying that economic problems are being exacerbated by European rules. When Tony Blair arrives in Warsaw on Thursday night it will be for one of the most important statements on Europe of his premiership. His speech on Friday has to be heard above all the euro-sceptic noise. The preparation has been meticulous. In a briefing to journalists before the summer holidays, Alastair Campbell, the Prime Minister's official spokesman, let slip that Blair was preparing 'something big' on Europe for the autumn. Campbell would not be pushed further, but it was clear that it was such a significant move that he was turning his mind to it months ago. Last month the rumour mill started in earnest. Keith Vaz, the Minister for Europe, told colleagues that he had seen 'the third draft' of this 'most important speech'. David Clark, Robin Cook's special adviser on European affairs, was brought in to help. What would be the right tone? How could the Prime Minister enthuse a jaded public? Blair has been casting widely for the correct approach. On Friday, Roger Liddle was not taking many calls. For much of the day Downing Street's European expert was locked in meetings as the final touches were added to Blair's speech. Liddle will be expected to set the right parameters for the debate. The Prime Minister's speech will be the big set-piece event on Europe of the autumn, designed to blow the Conservative Party conference's sceptical stance off the agenda. Blair will take a new line. We all know the tired phrases of being for the European single currency in principle as long as the five economic tests are met. But government sources were suggesting this weekend that far from concentrating on Gordon Brown's iron laws, the Prime Minister will make a more philosophical speech, a political rallying cry about why Britain must be at the centre of Europe. He will talk about democracy, the need to make Europe more responsive to the nation states it is supposed to serve. He will launch an idea of an elected second chamber to work alongside the European Parliament. He will talk of his desire to bring home the European project, make it relevant, make the continent come alive. He will talk about enlargement and the new brotherhood of nations. At the Labour Party conference last week Peter Mandelson, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the Cabinet's leading pro-European, argued that a more political case needed to be made for Europe, away from the desiccated words of economics. Blair has taken heed. Robin Cook, the Foreign Secretary, also knows of the need for action. He flew back from a meeting of European Socialist leaders in Brussels late last Thursday evening to a slew of negative headlines. He was advised to do the 'full run' of interviews the next morning, to lead the Government charge against those who say that the Danish vote will simply strengthen the negative feelings about Europe. On Friday morning Sky, the Today programme, BBC Breakfast, Radio 5 Live and ITN turned up at 1 Carlton Gardens, Cook's official residence in London, and were ushered in for interviews. Cook's line - agreed months earlier with Sir Stephen Wall, the Cabinet Office's European policy enforcer, Nigel Sheinwald, the ambassador in Brussels, and Kim Darroch, the British director of the European Union - was that the Danish vote had little effect on the British debate. But many of Blair's allies are not so sure. For Ken Jackson, the most outspoken pro-euro trade union leader and a member of the board of the pro-Europe Britain in Europe, there are problems ahead. He was phoned at home on Thursday evening with the Danish results. 'Politically, it does have implications,' Jackson said. 'It serves as a warning that the pro-euro campaign can't rely on a grand-coalition and rely on the people to believe what you say. It's a wake-up call to do the campaigning.' The question now is the effect the Danish vote will have on Blair's enthusiasm for a referendum on whether Britain should join the euro during the next parliament. The Prime Minister, one senior adviser explained last week, is a '70-30 man'. If he doesn't believe he will win an issue overwhelmingly, he will not risk it. So the British referendum is in danger of being kicked into the long grass. Labour strategists are aware that the major problem will be time. Governments win referendums at the beginning of parliaments when there is less danger of them turning into plebiscites on their more general performance. If the public's mood does not fundamentally change over the next year, Blair is unlikely to pile into a referendum which, if lost, would be politically disastrous. There are elephant traps ahead. At the end of the year the hundreds of politicians and bureaucrats who will descend on Nice will have three major issues to fight over: enlargement (the inclusion of Poland, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary and Slovenia into the EU), the growth of a two-speed Europe; and the Charter of Fundamental Rights. All have their European downside. Enlargement introduces weaker eastern European currencies to the euro, which is likely to increase speculator pressure on a currency now bouncing along at historically low levels. 'Two-speed Europe' is a phrase that Blair, determined to be at the centre of things, hates. But its supporters are becoming more and more vociferous. At the weekend, signals from Berlin and Paris were that 'reinforced co-operation' would be high on the Nice agenda. It will allow certain countries, led by Germany and France, to continue towards greater integration. Finally, the Charter of Fundamental Rights has become embroiled in arguments about a European super-state bouncing national governments into agreements on workers' and citizens' rights. Originally, the charter was supposed to be a broad, somewhat vague, document similar to the Human Rights Act in Britain. But then the bureaucrats got hold of it and it became an overlong administrative document, with detailed proposals on workplace rules. The Government is concerned that a new charter more binding than a simple 'declaration' will confuse the rights issue. The problems are piling up and the pro-European argument is struggling. Analysts admit that it is difficult to see what tricks can be pulled out of the PR bag to change the tide of public opinion. Business leaders, such as the head of Nissan, keep saying that being outside the euro is damaging British manufacturing. They said it again at the end of last week. Once such words would make the front page lead in the Financial Times . On Thursday the story was relegated to page 2. Nissan are shouting in a vacuum. Pro-euro campaigners hope that the circulation of euro notes from January 2002 might have an effect, showing the public how the currency works in reality. But even that optimism is tinged with a fear that it could also show that Britain can remain outside the euro with few problems. Influential City economist Roger Bootle has already been advising his powerful blue-chip clients that they should assume Britain will stay out of the euro for 10 years. Many in the Treasury, who argue the health service and education are bigger priorities, agree. Over the din of toasts to 'the Danes!' up and down the country, Blair will struggle to be heard.

Rhys Parry, the influential South Wales organiser for the Farmers For Action group, said distribution centres for leading supermarket chains could be targeted by blockades similar to the ones which froze the fuel distribution network. Less than 100 such depots supply food nationwide to Safeway, Tesco, Sainsbury, Asda, Somerfield and Kwik Save. Parry estimated that many supermarket shelves could be cleared within two days, as most stores have only a day or two of stock on site and blockades could trigger panic buying of food by the public.</p> <p>Though such a widespread protest would require much larger organisation than the fuel blockades, Parry believes the scheme could work. 'We would not want to trigger a food shortage, but we could hit the supermarkets on a national level,' he said.</p> <p>Other options include a rail blockade. Protesters would form human chains across lines, forcing national rail cancellations and causing widespread disruption.

The Government, oil firms and some transport firms have agreed to make delivery of fuel a vital service, but any new legislation to guarantee supplies, in the same way as water and electricity, is unlikely to be in place before the 60-day deadline expires. 'Fuel is certainly still the most vulnerable target,' said Professor Paul Wilkinson, a terrorism and direct action specialist at the University of St Andrews.</p> <p>Tanker drivers might still be reluctant to cross unofficial pickets manned by their colleagues in the haulage business, and the fact that fuel is moved by road makes tanker deliveries leaving the depots at risk from go-slows.</p> <p>The plans could cause bitter confrontation with the police. 'Quite a small number of people with some bright ideas can do an awful lot of disruption,' Wilkinson said.</p> <p>The disclosures come after a week in which the Government has refused to soften its position on fuel tax. Chancellor Gordon Brown still has the option of scheduling cuts to fuel tax in his pre-budget speech and appeasing protes tors before the deadline passes. In his Brighton conference speech, Brown gave few signs he would grant any concessions. The speech outraged fuel protesters. 'He and Tony Blair totally missed the point. If they don't do something about the fuel tax, it is going to be a very hard winter for them,' said Clive Swan, a farmer near Mold in North Wales.</p> <p>Relying on their vast network of mobile phones and personal contacts, they aim to strike quickly and effectively across the country if no concessions are made. 'I can have 500 farmers out in two hours,' said Swan. 'We come from nowhere, do what's got to be done, and then disappear. We make a virtue out of our lack of structure,' Swan said.</p> <p>The protesters intend to discuss these proposals at a series of informal meetings over the next month, in the North Wales hills where the September protests began.</p> <p>The Transport Minister, Lord Macdonald, said yesterday that the Army may be used to drive petrol tankers in any future crisis, and government sources stressed that steps are being taken to improve intelligence on the protesters' activities and ensure better communication between different police forces.</p> <p>The police will also try to crack down swiftly on anyone blocking roads and abandon the 'softly-softly' approach they adopted last time.</p> <p>At blockades of refineries the police will offer to escort tankers through the picket lines as soon as the protesters arrive.</p>",

Less than 100 such depots supply food nationwide to Safeway, Tesco, Sainsbury, Asda, Somerfield and Kwik Save. Parry estimated that many supermarket shelves could be cleared within two days, as most stores have only a day or two of stock on site and blockades could trigger panic buying of food by the public. Though such a widespread protest would require much larger organisation than the fuel blockades, Parry believes the scheme could work. 'We would not want to trigger a food shortage, but we could hit the supermarkets on a national level,' he said. Other options include a rail blockade. Protesters would form human chains across lines, forcing national rail cancellations and causing widespread disruption. 'If you just put some bodies on the track and ring ahead to tell the railways what you are doing, you can easily stop the trains,' said one farmer in North Wales who was a key figure in triggering the fuel protests. One senior activist from the road haulier protesters said: 'We could take a holiday for three days - and simply not drive our lorries. They can't force us to.' Fuel refineries and depots will still be at the core of the protests. The Government, oil firms and some transport firms have agreed to make delivery of fuel a vital service, but any new legislation to guarantee supplies, in the same way as water and electricity, is unlikely to be in place before the 60-day deadline expires. 'Fuel is certainly still the most vulnerable target,' said Professor Paul Wilkinson, a terrorism and direct action specialist at the University of St Andrews. Tanker drivers might still be reluctant to cross unofficial pickets manned by their colleagues in the haulage business, and the fact that fuel is moved by road makes tanker deliveries leaving the depots at risk from go-slows. The plans could cause bitter confrontation with the police. 'Quite a small number of people with some bright ideas can do an awful lot of disruption,' Wilkinson said. The disclosures come after a week in which the Government has refused to soften its position on fuel tax. Chancellor Gordon Brown still has the option of scheduling cuts to fuel tax in his pre-budget speech and appeasing protes tors before the deadline passes. In his Brighton conference speech, Brown gave few signs he would grant any concessions. The speech outraged fuel protesters. 'He and Tony Blair totally missed the point. If they don't do something about the fuel tax, it is going to be a very hard winter for them,' said Clive Swan, a farmer near Mold in North Wales. Relying on their vast network of mobile phones and personal contacts, they aim to strike quickly and effectively across the country if no concessions are made. 'I can have 500 farmers out in two hours,' said Swan. 'We come from nowhere, do what's got to be done, and then disappear. We make a virtue out of our lack of structure,' Swan said. The protesters intend to discuss these proposals at a series of informal meetings over the next month, in the North Wales hills where the September protests began. The Transport Minister, Lord Macdonald, said yesterday that the Army may be used to drive petrol tankers in any future crisis, and government sources stressed that steps are being taken to improve intelligence on the protesters' activities and ensure better communication between different police forces. The police will also try to crack down swiftly on anyone blocking roads and abandon the 'softly-softly' approach they adopted last time. At blockades of refineries the police will offer to escort tankers through the picket lines as soon as the protesters arrive.",

      "body": "<p>At 30 he was a depressed and penniless unemployed former community relations worker trying to cope with a failing marriage. Nothing, it seemed, had worked out for Greg Dyke. </p> <p>He sat on Wandsworth Common, near his dingy flat in the unlovely streets of inner-city London, contemplating his latest personal disaster - defeat as a Labour candidate in the 1977 GLC election. His hopes of a career in politics lay in ruins. Dyke, bright, self-confident but never academically accomplished, had been the apple of his parents' eye - 'I was the one who was always meant to do well.' Head in hands, he wondered out loud: 'Whatever happened to me?' </p> <p>Dyke's rise to director-general of the BBC - the heart of the British establishment - is a tale for our times. The underachieving grammar school boy with strictly limited horizons, who stumbled into ITV late in life as the most junior of assistant programme-makers, climbed television's corporate ladder with astonishing speed by playing up his working-class roots. He then bagged around \u00a310 million from a series of golden handcuffs, share options and company takeover payouts, and ended up, as DG, at the very centre of the establishment he once so loudly denounced. </p> <p>Just a few years ago Dyke himself would not have believed it. 'Saddam Hussein's got more chance of running the BBC than me,' he once told an interviewer. 'I'm just not a BBC person.' For him, being a 'BBC person' meant Oxbridge, time-serving, a cultivated accent and, at the highest level in the corporation, all the right establishment attitudes and contacts. It meant being part of 'an intellectual elite' which Dyke himself once said had 'captured the TV production process' and was out of tune with the mass TV-watching audience. </p> <p>His appointment caused horror among tradition-alists who see the man best known for ditching News at Ten and bringing Roland Rat, Gladiators and Channel Five to the screen as the ultimate ratings chaser, a man with little interest in the BBC's role as guardian of Britain's cultural heritage. </p> <p>The man himself puts the opposition down to 'sheer snobbery' on the part of people who do not realise how the country has changed. The press campaign aimed at blocking Dyke was led by the Times; Rupert Murdoch once reportedly described Dyke to executives at Sky TV as 'our enemy'. The irony is that Dyke could easily have ended up working for Murdoch. </p> <p>After leaving school in 1965 with one A-level, Dyke stumbled into a job as a local newspaper reporter as an alternative to getting a 'proper job'. He worked at the same newspaper group as Raymond Snoddy, now a journalist on the Times . 'In those days I was the steady, serious broadsheet reporter and Greg was the populist tabloid man,' Snoddy says, adding: 'And nothing's changed.' </p> <p>Dyke took to tabloid journalism like a natural. Easily bored, he could enliven the most tedious local paper fare with a flash irreverence or a scathing putdown of some pompous local worthy. He was the life and soul of the office, joining in Thursday-night poker schools, when junior reporters would gamble their wages in the pub. </p> <p>He earned extra money by selling stories, complete with the required tabloid spin, to national newspapers. Many at the time thought he would make the logical next move on to a national newspaper; Murdoch's Sun, launched just a few years earlier and then still committed to the political Left, would have been perfect for him. Few doubt that he had the ability to become a national tabloid editor. </p> <p>But by the late Sixties Dyke had become political. He had nurtured a sense of social injustice ever since being subjected to the 11-plus exam, a searing experience for many of his generation. In his hedonistic twenties he had shared the vague American-inspired radicalism of the Bob Dylan and Woodstock generation. Dyke always was (and remains) a fan of American popular culture and, especially, the egalitarian 'can do' Californian outlook on life. </p> <p>The issue that gave his politics a harder edge was race. Covering the politics beat for the Slough Evening Mail led to a close friendship with the pioneering racial equality campaigner Joan Lestor, the local MP. Slough, together with the suburbs of Hayes and Southall where Dyke had grown up, had become major centres for Asian immigration. It was Dyke's job to report on the resulting racial tensions. He was appalled by the racialism of parts of the Tory party and by the way newspaper journalists often gave a circulation-boosting racial slant to stories. </p> <p>In 1971, deeply committed to Labour's left wing, Dyke decided that newspaper journalism was too 'glib' and went to York University to take stock and study politics (by now he had his trade-mark beard and long hair; his specialist subject was Che Guevara and the Cuban revolution). </p> <p>At university he met and married his first wife, Christine Taylor. She was generally regarded as the most beautiful woman at the college and, since Dyke could never claim to be an oil painting himself, the couple were known to some as 'Beauty and the Beast'. The childless marriage was to span the Seventies, for the most part an aimless and unhappy decade for Dyke. After graduating, he followed Christine to Newcastle, where he was turned down for a job as a reporter on a local BBC radio station and had to seek work on the sort of local newspapers he thought he had left behind. </p> <p>It was then Dyke made the decision to move back to London with Christine and take a job as 'campaigns officer' at Wandsworth Community Relations Council, a group promoting good race relations, in South London. </p> <p>He hated the job and jacked it in to concentrate on a campaign to be elected GLC councillor for Putney, a post that carried a good salary and the prospect of later becoming an MP. The election, in the then safeish but rapidly gentrifying constituency, ended in disaster and Dyke's stroll on Wandsworth Common. </p> <p>Things looked bleak until Nick Evans, a fellow reporter from Newcastle who had taken a job as a TV journalist at London Weekend Television, steered him into a junior job working on LWT's local politics programme. This was to be his big break and, significantly, it came through the network of friends in the media he had started to accumulate. </p> <p>LWT was really buzzing. It was the ITV station responsible, under Michael Grade, for the glitz and glamour of the Saturday-night showbiz schedule and, at the same time, the very heart of lavishly funded trendy and 'youth' television - home of Melvyn Bragg's South Bank show, the Minority Programmes Unit (which produced the first programmes for black people, lesbians, gays and other minorities) and many of the people who were to be leading lights in Channel Four. Dyke worked in the more sedate and intellectual current affairs department, where the austere style was set by eggheads such as John Birt and Peter Jay, with their 'Mission to Explain'. </p> <p>By now age was starting to count heavily against Dyke. Entry into TV journalism after the age of 30 was almost unheard of, and he knew that he had to prove himself quickly if he was to make any sort of career in TV. He made an immediate impact, working round the clock, playing up his tabloid background as the rough-tough, streetwise 'man of the people' who could cut through all the intellectual bullshit to give LWT's politics programmes a sharper, populist edge. </p> <p>He was rewarded with the risky but important job of launching an early-evening popular current affairs programme - vital to LWT's ratings and profits. The result was The Six O'Clock Show fronted by Michael Aspel and Janet Street-Porter, reckoned by many to be the first (and much copied) example of British tabloid TV. The show - tame by today's standards - consisted mainly of silly stunts dreamed up by Dyke and his growing coterie of mates. </p> <p>It also launched the mainstream TV careers of Danny Baker, in many ways a sort of on-screen version of Dyke himself, and Charlie Parsons, creator of The Big Breakfast Planet 24 empire. Behind the scenes the producers and technical people Dyke used on The Six O'Clock Show formed a tightly knit group who went on to dominate much of trendy, populist TV production in the UK. The success of The Six O'Clock Show led to an even greater challenge - to rescue ailing breakfast TV station TV-am. </p> <p>The station had been launched with all sorts of fancy and intellectual programme ideas; these had impressed the TV regulators but had been met with mass boredom from the breakfast audience. Dyke turned the station upside-down, brought in a new schedule based round Roland Rat, bingo, celebrity gossip, horoscopes, Diana Dors and her diet (producing one of Dyke's favourite TV moments, the sight of several stones of raw lard, representing what she had supposedly lost thanks to TV-am's advice) and endless talk about the weather, sunshine and holiday plans. </p> <p>It was another massive hit, elevating Dyke from being a mere programme-maker to becoming a chauffeur-driven TV executive and one of the most sought-after people in the television business. </p> <p>He was soon on the move again, this time taking charge of TVS (now Meridian), the ITV company for the South of England. Dyke was now living in a big house in rural Hampshire with Sue Howes, a a sociology teacher. He was starting to become a wealthy man. </p> <p>He and Sue would say that they didn't really like living in posh Hampshire and missed the graffiti and noise of the inner city. </p> <p>It seemed the more powerful and wealthy Dyke became, the more he played up his working-class roots and dislike of high culture - carefully crafting an image as a 'man of the people' who knew what the masses wanted. Once, finding himself at the Glyndebourne Opera Festival on TVS business, Dyke turned to Sue and said: 'You know what - we've become the sort of people we used to want to throw bombs at.' </p> <p>From TVS, Dyke moved back to LWT, where he took over as Director of Programmes and then Managing Director, becoming one of the most powerful men in British television and, apparently, destined one day to run ITV. </p> <p>It was as managing director that Dyke met Christopher (later Sir Christopher) Bland, the LWT chairman and now BBC chairman, which is the key to the future of the BBC. Bland was an Oxbridge, ex-army, high Tory politician and City financier, who married into the aristocracy. </p> <p>On the face of it he and Dyke were chalk and cheese. But together they reckoned they covered the whole waterfront. Bland had the contacts in the City and in the bowels of the Tory establishment; Dyke was close to the emerging New Labour hierarchy, had the instincts of the mass TV audience in his blood, and knew how to make popular television. </p> <p>Together they set about making LWT the most aggressively commercial and profitable company in British TV. Dyke stripped out whole layers of management, oversaw massive job cuts and prepared to run the station single-handed in the event of a strike. He won so much trust from the colleagues he was sacking, and carried out the downsizing exercise with such skill and generosity in terms of redundancy packages, that he emerged, if anything, more popular than before. </p> <p>When Bland and Dyke won back LWT's licence to broadcast in the 1993 franchise auction the two men roared round the building to the strains of the Theme From Rocky in the manner of a football manager and his captain doing a lap of honour at Wembley. </p> <p>Dyke and Bland's new lean and mean LWT was the toast of the City. LWT shares soared, resulting in Dyke eventually reaping around \u00a36 million from a golden handcuffs share option scheme devised by Bland. </p> <p>The plan was to use LWT's growing financial muscle to buy out the other ITV franchises (such as Granada and Central) and thus dominate the whole of ITV. </p> <p>Instead LWT, the hunter, became the prey. The company was bought up by Granada in one of the most bitterly contested takeover battles of the Nineties. Dyke and Bland earned still more millions once Granada took over. But the personal cost was devastation. </p> <p>LWT, Dyke's pride and joy, had ceased to exist. It was a complete debacle, one of the darkest days of his life. Dyke hit out at the City institutions which had brought about LWT's demise, calling them 'parasites' and denouncing the whole set-up as 'the last vestige of the old class system'. </p> <p>A disgusted Dyke announced that he was leaving TV. What led to his successful change of course was the arrival of Bland as BBC chairman and, crucially, the election of the New Labour government. </p> <p>Dyke had never made any bones about his political commitment and, with time on his hands after leaving LWT, he was even offered a peerage. Dyke's response was withering: 'Me? Lord Dyke of Hayes - can you imagine it? It sounds like a bloody gay girls' pop group!' </p> <p>Now, with a generally pro-BBC Labour government in power, Dyke finds himself in a much more powerful position than any director-general since Lord Reith. </p> <p>Dyke once described his share option millions as 'f*** off money', meaning that he need never again put up with a decision he disagreed with just to keep his job. At one point, he even offered to forgo the DG's \u00a3400,000 salary. More importantly, Bland will keep the governors - the people ultimately in charge of the corporation and bane of many a previous DG's life - off his back. </p> <p>The Dyke internal revolution has already begun.

      "bodyText": "At 30 he was a depressed and penniless unemployed former community relations worker trying to cope with a failing marriage. Nothing, it seemed, had worked out for Greg Dyke. He sat on Wandsworth Common, near his dingy flat in the unlovely streets of inner-city London, contemplating his latest personal disaster - defeat as a Labour candidate in the 1977 GLC election. His hopes of a career in politics lay in ruins. Dyke, bright, self-confident but never academically accomplished, had been the apple of his parents' eye - 'I was the one who was always meant to do well.' Head in hands, he wondered out loud: 'Whatever happened to me?' Dyke's rise to director-general of the BBC - the heart of the British establishment - is a tale for our times. The underachieving grammar school boy with strictly limited horizons, who stumbled into ITV late in life as the most junior of assistant programme-makers, climbed television's corporate ladder with astonishing speed by playing up his working-class roots. He then bagged around \u00a310 million from a series of golden handcuffs, share options and company takeover payouts, and ended up, as DG, at the very centre of the establishment he once so loudly denounced. Just a few years ago Dyke himself would not have believed it. 'Saddam Hussein's got more chance of running the BBC than me,' he once told an interviewer. 'I'm just not a BBC person.' For him, being a 'BBC person' meant Oxbridge, time-serving, a cultivated accent and, at the highest level in the corporation, all the right establishment attitudes and contacts. It meant being part of 'an intellectual elite' which Dyke himself once said had 'captured the TV production process' and was out of tune with the mass TV-watching audience. His appointment caused horror among tradition-alists who see the man best known for ditching News at Ten and bringing Roland Rat, Gladiators and Channel Five to the screen as the ultimate ratings chaser, a man with little interest in the BBC's role as guardian of Britain's cultural heritage. The man himself puts the opposition down to 'sheer snobbery' on the part of people who do not realise how the country has changed. The press campaign aimed at blocking Dyke was led by the Times; Rupert Murdoch once reportedly described Dyke to executives at Sky TV as 'our enemy'. The irony is that Dyke could easily have ended up working for Murdoch. After leaving school in 1965 with one A-level, Dyke stumbled into a job as a local newspaper reporter as an alternative to getting a 'proper job'. He worked at the same newspaper group as Raymond Snoddy, now a journalist on the Times . 'In those days I was the steady, serious broadsheet reporter and Greg was the populist tabloid man,' Snoddy says, adding: 'And nothing's changed.' Dyke took to tabloid journalism like a natural. Easily bored, he could enliven the most tedious local paper fare with a flash irreverence or a scathing putdown of some pompous local worthy. He was the life and soul of the office, joining in Thursday-night poker schools, when junior reporters would gamble their wages in the pub. He earned extra money by selling stories, complete with the required tabloid spin, to national newspapers. Many at the time thought he would make the logical next move on to a national newspaper; Murdoch's Sun, launched just a few years earlier and then still committed to the political Left, would have been perfect for him. Few doubt that he had the ability to become a national tabloid editor. But by the late Sixties Dyke had become political. He had nurtured a sense of social injustice ever since being subjected to the 11-plus exam, a searing experience for many of his generation. In his hedonistic twenties he had shared the vague American-inspired radicalism of the Bob Dylan and Woodstock generation. Dyke always was (and remains) a fan of American popular culture and, especially, the egalitarian 'can do' Californian outlook on life. The issue that gave his politics a harder edge was race. Covering the politics beat for the Slough Evening Mail led to a close friendship with the pioneering racial equality campaigner Joan Lestor, the local MP. Slough, together with the suburbs of Hayes and Southall where Dyke had grown up, had become major centres for Asian immigration. It was Dyke's job to report on the resulting racial tensions. He was appalled by the racialism of parts of the Tory party and by the way newspaper journalists often gave a circulation-boosting racial slant to stories. In 1971, deeply committed to Labour's left wing, Dyke decided that newspaper journalism was too 'glib' and went to York University to take stock and study politics (by now he had his trade-mark beard and long hair; his specialist subject was Che Guevara and the Cuban revolution). At university he met and married his first wife, Christine Taylor. She was generally regarded as the most beautiful woman at the college and, since Dyke could never claim to be an oil painting himself, the couple were known to some as 'Beauty and the Beast'. The childless marriage was to span the Seventies, for the most part an aimless and unhappy decade for Dyke. After graduating, he followed Christine to Newcastle, where he was turned down for a job as a reporter on a local BBC radio station and had to seek work on the sort of local newspapers he thought he had left behind. It was then Dyke made the decision to move back to London with Christine and take a job as 'campaigns officer' at Wandsworth Community Relations Council, a group promoting good race relations, in South London. He hated the job and jacked it in to concentrate on a campaign to be elected GLC councillor for Putney, a post that carried a good salary and the prospect of later becoming an MP. The election, in the then safeish but rapidly gentrifying constituency, ended in disaster and Dyke's stroll on Wandsworth Common. Things looked bleak until Nick Evans, a fellow reporter from Newcastle who had taken a job as a TV journalist at London Weekend Television, steered him into a junior job working on LWT's local politics programme. This was to be his big break and, significantly, it came through the network of friends in the media he had started to accumulate. LWT was really buzzing. It was the ITV station responsible, under Michael Grade, for the glitz and glamour of the Saturday-night showbiz schedule and, at the same time, the very heart of lavishly funded trendy and 'youth' television - home of Melvyn Bragg's South Bank show, the Minority Programmes Unit (which produced the first programmes for black people, lesbians, gays and other minorities) and many of the people who were to be leading lights in Channel Four. Dyke worked in the more sedate and intellectual current affairs department, where the austere style was set by eggheads such as John Birt and Peter Jay, with their 'Mission to Explain'. By now age was starting to count heavily against Dyke. Entry into TV journalism after the age of 30 was almost unheard of, and he knew that he had to prove himself quickly if he was to make any sort of career in TV. He made an immediate impact, working round the clock, playing up his tabloid background as the rough-tough, streetwise 'man of the people' who could cut through all the intellectual bullshit to give LWT's politics programmes a sharper, populist edge. He was rewarded with the risky but important job of launching an early-evening popular current affairs programme - vital to LWT's ratings and profits. The result was The Six O'Clock Show fronted by Michael Aspel and Janet Street-Porter, reckoned by many to be the first (and much copied) example of British tabloid TV. The show - tame by today's standards - consisted mainly of silly stunts dreamed up by Dyke and his growing coterie of mates. It also launched the mainstream TV careers of Danny Baker, in many ways a sort of on-screen version of Dyke himself, and Charlie Parsons, creator of The Big Breakfast Planet 24 empire. Behind the scenes the producers and technical people Dyke used on The Six O'Clock Show formed a tightly knit group who went on to dominate much of trendy, populist TV production in the UK. The success of The Six O'Clock Show led to an even greater challenge - to rescue ailing breakfast TV station TV-am. The station had been launched with all sorts of fancy and intellectual programme ideas; these had impressed the TV regulators but had been met with mass boredom from the breakfast audience. Dyke turned the station upside-down, brought in a new schedule based round Roland Rat, bingo, celebrity gossip, horoscopes, Diana Dors and her diet (producing one of Dyke's favourite TV moments, the sight of several stones of raw lard, representing what she had supposedly lost thanks to TV-am's advice) and endless talk about the weather, sunshine and holiday plans. It was another massive hit, elevating Dyke from being a mere programme-maker to becoming a chauffeur-driven TV executive and one of the most sought-after people in the television business. He was soon on the move again, this time taking charge of TVS (now Meridian), the ITV company for the South of England. Dyke was now living in a big house in rural Hampshire with Sue Howes, a a sociology teacher. He was starting to become a wealthy man. He and Sue would say that they didn't really like living in posh Hampshire and missed the graffiti and noise of the inner city. It seemed the more powerful and wealthy Dyke became, the more he played up his working-class roots and dislike of high culture - carefully crafting an image as a 'man of the people' who knew what the masses wanted. Once, finding himself at the Glyndebourne Opera Festival on TVS business, Dyke turned to Sue and said: 'You know what - we've become the sort of people we used to want to throw bombs at.' From TVS, Dyke moved back to LWT, where he took over as Director of Programmes and then Managing Director, becoming one of the most powerful men in British television and, apparently, destined one day to run ITV. It was as managing director that Dyke met Christopher (later Sir Christopher) Bland, the LWT chairman and now BBC chairman, which is the key to the future of the BBC. Bland was an Oxbridge, ex-army, high Tory politician and City financier, who married into the aristocracy. On the face of it he and Dyke were chalk and cheese. But together they reckoned they covered the whole waterfront. Bland had the contacts in the City and in the bowels of the Tory establishment; Dyke was close to the emerging New Labour hierarchy, had the instincts of the mass TV audience in his blood, and knew how to make popular television. Together they set about making LWT the most aggressively commercial and profitable company in British TV. Dyke stripped out whole layers of management, oversaw massive job cuts and prepared to run the station single-handed in the event of a strike. He won so much trust from the colleagues he was sacking, and carried out the downsizing exercise with such skill and generosity in terms of redundancy packages, that he emerged, if anything, more popular than before. When Bland and Dyke won back LWT's licence to broadcast in the 1993 franchise auction the two men roared round the building to the strains of the Theme From Rocky in the manner of a football manager and his captain doing a lap of honour at Wembley. Dyke and Bland's new lean and mean LWT was the toast of the City. LWT shares soared, resulting in Dyke eventually reaping around \u00a36 million from a golden handcuffs share option scheme devised by Bland. The plan was to use LWT's growing financial muscle to buy out the other ITV franchises (such as Granada and Central) and thus dominate the whole of ITV. Instead LWT, the hunter, became the prey. The company was bought up by Granada in one of the most bitterly contested takeover battles of the Nineties. Dyke and Bland earned still more millions once Granada took over. But the personal cost was devastation. LWT, Dyke's pride and joy, had ceased to exist. It was a complete debacle, one of the darkest days of his life. Dyke hit out at the City institutions which had brought about LWT's demise, calling them 'parasites' and denouncing the whole set-up as 'the last vestige of the old class system'. A disgusted Dyke announced that he was leaving TV. What led to his successful change of course was the arrival of Bland as BBC chairman and, crucially, the election of the New Labour government. Dyke had never made any bones about his political commitment and, with time on his hands after leaving LWT, he was even offered a peerage. Dyke's response was withering: 'Me? Lord Dyke of Hayes - can you imagine it? It sounds like a bloody gay girls' pop group!' Now, with a generally pro-BBC Labour government in power, Dyke finds himself in a much more powerful position than any director-general since Lord Reith. Dyke once described his share option millions as 'f*** off money', meaning that he need never again put up with a decision he disagreed with just to keep his job. At one point, he even offered to forgo the DG's \u00a3400,000 salary. More importantly, Bland will keep the governors - the people ultimately in charge of the corporation and bane of many a previous DG's life - off his back. The Dyke internal revolution has already begun. The abolition of perks such as free cars for managers and long expense-account lunches has grabbed the headlines. 'Ever heard of sandwiches,' he once scrawled on a three-figure luncheon expenses claim from a minion. More importantly, he has already stripped out layers of committees and managers, centralising power in the hands of a tight group of trusted lieutenants determined to run the once highly devolved, fractious BBC as a single, highly-tuned broadcasting machine.

If they ended up without enough to live on, they would still be entitled to state benefits.</p> <p>But Labour is likely to remind voters of the pensions mis-selling scandals of the 1980s, when thousands of public sector workers opted out of their occupational schemes into private plans on which they lost money.</p>",

Meanwhile, William Hague will try to exploit Labour's troubles with pensioners by promising to trump any rise in the basic state pension the Government makes. The Tories would award a flat-rate increase of \u00a38.50 for a single pensioner and \u00a312 for a couple against an expected \u00a35 and \u00a38 from Labour. But Labour will be quick to point out the apparent largesse comes from adding up the extra cash currently spent on the poorest pensioners, free TV licences and winter fuel payments, and redistributing the same money between all OAPs - a shift to benefit the better off most. Hague, due to be interviewed on Breakfast with Frost this morning, is expected to insist he now has New Labour on the run. However, ministers are likely to hit back hard. The Tories first unveiled their pensions package earlier in summer, but it has now been updated to keep pace with expectations that Gordon Brown will do more for pensioners following last week's conference revolt. Shadow social security secretary David Willetts says his alternative to the state pension, for under-30s only, would eventually secure them a pension of \u00a3130 a week on market trends, nearly twice that on offer from the state. The Government would calculate the minimum a worker would ordinarily pay in National Insurance and give this to the individual to invest in approved private schemes. If they ended up without enough to live on, they would still be entitled to state benefits. But Labour is likely to remind voters of the pensions mis-selling scandals of the 1980s, when thousands of public sector workers opted out of their occupational schemes into private plans on which they lost money.",

      "body": "<p>At least nine Palestinians were killed as violent confrontations with Israeli forces continued for a third day and brought the peace process to a new crisis.</p> <p>Guns, sticks and stones were used in the clashes in Arab East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza yesterday. Among the dead was a 14-year-old Palestinian protester, killed in an exchange of live gunfire in the West Bank city of Nablus.</p> <p>The latest deaths brought to at least 15 the number of Palestinians killed in the past three days. Four of the dead were Palestinian police officers. Two Israeli soldiers werekilled last week.</p> <p>Last night Israeli army chief Shaul Mofaz called a 'ceasefire', saying the violence would stop. But some Palestinians refused to accept it, and clashes continued.</p> <p>Yesterday was supposed to have been a day of mourning. Instead the situation grew steadily out of control. In an alley outside the Haram al- Sharif, the gleaming gold Dome of the Rock mosque in Jerusalem, young Palestinian men collected on a rooftop at the end of afternoon prayers.</p> <p>They piled up their rocks, and waited for the next round. They watched Israeli forces making their own preparations down a gloomy alley.</p> <p>Behind the wall, Palestinian women were gathering blocks of ice for wounds and onions for tear gas, and wrestling with a few hotheads who had brought guns along.</p> <p>Dozens of Israelis stormed in and the alley was engulfed in the percussive roar of stun grenades and tear gas, and the wailing of men hit by rubber bullets. There was a frantic stampede for sanctuary and the long minutes of waiting, marked by the arrival of young men bleeding from head wounds or overcome by tear gas.</p> <p>At last there was quiet. When people dared to look outside, they found smashed cars and water gushing out of the mains on to cobblestones strewn with tear-gas cannis ters, upturned water tankers, and rubble. Guarding the picture of devastation were scores of Israeli troops, now firmly back in charge, of this lane at least.</p> <p>Such clashes were replicated, often in even more violent form, in the Gaza Strip, and in the West Bank cities of Nablus, Ramallah, Hebron and Bethlehem. Palestinian security sources said 300 had been hurt in Gaza alone.</p> <p>The rioting had been sparked by the provocative visit to the Haram by the hardline Likud leader Ariel Sharon. He is the most hated Israeli in the Arab world, and his presence there was too much to bear.</p> <p>The peace process has been deadlocked over the fate of the Haram, holy both to Jews and Muslims.

      "bodyText": "At least nine Palestinians were killed as violent confrontations with Israeli forces continued for a third day and brought the peace process to a new crisis. Guns, sticks and stones were used in the clashes in Arab East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza yesterday. Among the dead was a 14-year-old Palestinian protester, killed in an exchange of live gunfire in the West Bank city of Nablus. The latest deaths brought to at least 15 the number of Palestinians killed in the past three days. Four of the dead were Palestinian police officers. Two Israeli soldiers werekilled last week. Last night Israeli army chief Shaul Mofaz called a 'ceasefire', saying the violence would stop. But some Palestinians refused to accept it, and clashes continued. Yesterday was supposed to have been a day of mourning. Instead the situation grew steadily out of control. In an alley outside the Haram al- Sharif, the gleaming gold Dome of the Rock mosque in Jerusalem, young Palestinian men collected on a rooftop at the end of afternoon prayers. They piled up their rocks, and waited for the next round. They watched Israeli forces making their own preparations down a gloomy alley. Behind the wall, Palestinian women were gathering blocks of ice for wounds and onions for tear gas, and wrestling with a few hotheads who had brought guns along. Dozens of Israelis stormed in and the alley was engulfed in the percussive roar of stun grenades and tear gas, and the wailing of men hit by rubber bullets. There was a frantic stampede for sanctuary and the long minutes of waiting, marked by the arrival of young men bleeding from head wounds or overcome by tear gas. At last there was quiet. When people dared to look outside, they found smashed cars and water gushing out of the mains on to cobblestones strewn with tear-gas cannis ters, upturned water tankers, and rubble. Guarding the picture of devastation were scores of Israeli troops, now firmly back in charge, of this lane at least. Such clashes were replicated, often in even more violent form, in the Gaza Strip, and in the West Bank cities of Nablus, Ramallah, Hebron and Bethlehem. Palestinian security sources said 300 had been hurt in Gaza alone. The rioting had been sparked by the provocative visit to the Haram by the hardline Likud leader Ariel Sharon. He is the most hated Israeli in the Arab world, and his presence there was too much to bear. The peace process has been deadlocked over the fate of the Haram, holy both to Jews and Muslims. Last week President Clinton was testing reactions to the idea of sharing control over it. Now such ideas seem further from reality than ever. In many parts of the West Bank and Jerusalem, Islamic clerics and Palestinian officials confessed they were powerless to contain their people's rage. 'Now I can say for sure that things are out of control,' said Faisal Husseini, the Palestinian official in charge of Jerusalem affairs. He said he had pleaded with the Israeli authorities to stop the visit by Sharon, which Palestinians see as a brazen attempt to assert Jewish sovereignty over the Haram, the third holiest shrine in Islam. Their failure to do so, he said, was directly responsible for the bloodshed. Such warnings were ignored, with Israeli officials claiming it was the right of every citizen to visit the Haram, or as they call it the Temple Mount, which they revere as the site of their destroyed temple. Now, in the lanes of Jerusalem's Old City, the Palestinians say they have only begun to fight. They have draped the gate to the Haram in a huge Palestinian flag and plastered the walls with photos of the newest martyr to the struggle for control of Arab East Jerusalem. Israel's Prime Minister, Ehud Barak, has blamed the violence directly on the Palestinian leadership.",

      "bodyText": "The National Lottery is facing a crisis of Dome-like proportions and the potential loss of millions of pounds for good causes due to a meltdown in the process to decide who should run it, The Observer can reveal. Against a backdrop of acute concern by bodies reliant on lottery cash, figures involved in the bidding process have expressed doubt for the first time about whether the new licence to run the weekly gamble for good causes will start on time next year. Letters obtained by The Observer reveal growing anxiety among charities and the present operator, Camelot, about the way the Lottery Commission is handling the bidding for the new licence to run the lottery from next September. They show a complete breakdown in communication between key players charged with finding the best group to run the twice-weekly draw. Charities and sporting bodies which have had such success in the Olympics would lose \u00a34 million for each day the lottery fails to operate. Senior executives at Camelot said that the lottery was in danger of becoming 'the next Dome'. One executive said delays, confusion over lottery targets and legal challenges mean there is now a 'real danger' the new operator will not be in a position to take over the multi-million pound business next year. A remarkable letter from Dianne Thompson, the chief executive of Camelot, to Dame Helena Shovelton, the chairwoman of the Commission, reveals a crisis at the heart of the lottery. 'I am writing to place on record Camelot's grave concerns about the state of the licensing process,' Thompson wrote.

Such a move would be highly embarrassing for the Commission and Chris Smith, the Secretary of State for Culture, who appointed the commission members and stood by them during recent rows over how Richard Branson's People's Lottery was awarded the original licence. The Commission had to withdraw the Branson offer after Camelot successfully challenged their decision in the High Court, which said that the Commission had been 'conspicuously unfair'. Camelot has now been given a month to re-submit its bid, leading to further delays.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>'You are now entering Free Derry' the slogan painted in black letters on a white wall, has become one of the most enduring images of the Troubles. It has been seen over and over again on television often as the background to violent clashes between the security forces and the people of the Bogside.</p> <p>Over the years most of the Sinn Fein leaders associated with the long march from armed rebellion to political respectability have addressed the supporters here. Just across the road a youthful Martin McGuinness, at that time an IRA leader in Derry, made his first public speech. It was short and to the point: 'It doesn't matter what John Hume says. We'll fight on until we get a united Ireland.'</p> <p>Now Free Derry Corner is to become, officially, a national monument. Last week an alliance of Sinn Fein and the SDLP on the city council voted that the area should be handed over to the Department of the Environment's Heritage Service. The Minister who will be responsible for looking after it is Sam Foster, an Ulster Unionist member of the new power sharing executive.</p> <p>It is a potent symbol of changing times. The slogan 'You are now entering Free Derry' was first painted on to the gable end of a small terraced house in the Bogside in 1969. It was during an uneasy period when the Civil Rights movement was holding massive rallies to protest against discrimination but before the Army was sent to Northern Ireland. The row of cramped houses was later demolished but the gable wall was left standing by itself and the area became known as Free Derry Corner.</p> <p>It was a focal point of republican defiance. Each year the march held to commemorate Bloody Sunday in Derry, when 13 marchers were shot by the British soldiers, ended with a rally here. It was at this wall that Bernadette Devlin spoke to reporters when she was released from jail.</p> <p>Free Derry Corner has changed in recent years as peace has become a reality. There are landscaped flowerbeds. On nearby walls large and graphic murals depict key moments of the area's history over the past 30 years.</p> <p>It has become a tourist attraction. American visitors come in coachloads. Sometimes a group of British squaddies, coming to the end of a tour of duty, will venture up to Free Derry Corner to have their photographs taken. But the old revolutionary spirit persists. Local groups campaigning on such contentious issues as abortion and gay rights use the back of the wall to put across their message.</p> <p>Free Derry Corner was not the only historic monument in the city to change hands last week. By a pleasant irony the Ministry of Defence announced that Fort George, which has been the Army's headquarters in the west side of Derry for almost 30 years, is to be handed back to its original owners. The Londonderry Port and Harbour Commissioners planned to build a flagship commercial development on the 15-acre site.</p> <p>The decision to leave Fort George is part of the Government's programme to reduce the security presence in Northern Ireland. Six Army bases along the border in Co Fermanagh are also to be demolished. The Army points out that 40 military bases and installations have been closed down since 1995. At the moment there are 13,500 soldiers in the province. The hope is that, all being well, this figure will be cut to 8,000. Sinn Fein describes this process as demilitarisation. The Army prefers the more hopeful term normalisation. Unionists have been critical of this scaling down of the Army presence, which they claim is being done to pander to the IRA.</p> <p>Others see it as part of a deliberate strategy to extract concessions from the IRA to help David Trimble.</p> <p>The issue of policing and the demands of nationalist leaders for a full implementation of the Patten Report make it very difficult for the Government to move on that front. But a dramatic gesture from the IRA, such as another inspection of its arms dumps by internationally respected figures, might help Trimble fend off his critics.</p> <p>It often seems that the peace process in Northern Ireland simply lurches from crisis to crisis. But at a political level there has been much more steady progress. Last week Trimble, accompanied by most of his Ministers, came to Dublin for the second plenary meeting of the North South Ministerial Council. In Belfast, the names of 60 members of the new Civic Forum were announced. This will act as a wide-ranging consultative body to the assembly.</p> <p>This is how peace is built - slowly and with great difficulty. It will take a long time to complete the long journey from armed conflict to reconciliation. But in Derry at least, people believe that it is time to move on. Free Derry Corner is now seen as part of the city's history, a place for respect and conservation, but no longer a rallying point for rebellion against the state.</p>",

      "bodyText": "'You are now entering Free Derry' the slogan painted in black letters on a white wall, has become one of the most enduring images of the Troubles. It has been seen over and over again on television often as the background to violent clashes between the security forces and the people of the Bogside. Over the years most of the Sinn Fein leaders associated with the long march from armed rebellion to political respectability have addressed the supporters here. Just across the road a youthful Martin McGuinness, at that time an IRA leader in Derry, made his first public speech. It was short and to the point: 'It doesn't matter what John Hume says. We'll fight on until we get a united Ireland.' Now Free Derry Corner is to become, officially, a national monument. Last week an alliance of Sinn Fein and the SDLP on the city council voted that the area should be handed over to the Department of the Environment's Heritage Service. The Minister who will be responsible for looking after it is Sam Foster, an Ulster Unionist member of the new power sharing executive. It is a potent symbol of changing times. The slogan 'You are now entering Free Derry' was first painted on to the gable end of a small terraced house in the Bogside in 1969. It was during an uneasy period when the Civil Rights movement was holding massive rallies to protest against discrimination but before the Army was sent to Northern Ireland. The row of cramped houses was later demolished but the gable wall was left standing by itself and the area became known as Free Derry Corner. It was a focal point of republican defiance. Each year the march held to commemorate Bloody Sunday in Derry, when 13 marchers were shot by the British soldiers, ended with a rally here. It was at this wall that Bernadette Devlin spoke to reporters when she was released from jail. Free Derry Corner has changed in recent years as peace has become a reality. There are landscaped flowerbeds. On nearby walls large and graphic murals depict key moments of the area's history over the past 30 years. It has become a tourist attraction. American visitors come in coachloads. Sometimes a group of British squaddies, coming to the end of a tour of duty, will venture up to Free Derry Corner to have their photographs taken. But the old revolutionary spirit persists. Local groups campaigning on such contentious issues as abortion and gay rights use the back of the wall to put across their message. Free Derry Corner was not the only historic monument in the city to change hands last week. By a pleasant irony the Ministry of Defence announced that Fort George, which has been the Army's headquarters in the west side of Derry for almost 30 years, is to be handed back to its original owners. The Londonderry Port and Harbour Commissioners planned to build a flagship commercial development on the 15-acre site. The decision to leave Fort George is part of the Government's programme to reduce the security presence in Northern Ireland. Six Army bases along the border in Co Fermanagh are also to be demolished. The Army points out that 40 military bases and installations have been closed down since 1995. At the moment there are 13,500 soldiers in the province. The hope is that, all being well, this figure will be cut to 8,000. Sinn Fein describes this process as demilitarisation. The Army prefers the more hopeful term normalisation. Unionists have been critical of this scaling down of the Army presence, which they claim is being done to pander to the IRA. Others see it as part of a deliberate strategy to extract concessions from the IRA to help David Trimble. The issue of policing and the demands of nationalist leaders for a full implementation of the Patten Report make it very difficult for the Government to move on that front. But a dramatic gesture from the IRA, such as another inspection of its arms dumps by internationally respected figures, might help Trimble fend off his critics. It often seems that the peace process in Northern Ireland simply lurches from crisis to crisis. But at a political level there has been much more steady progress. Last week Trimble, accompanied by most of his Ministers, came to Dublin for the second plenary meeting of the North South Ministerial Council. In Belfast, the names of 60 members of the new Civic Forum were announced. This will act as a wide-ranging consultative body to the assembly. This is how peace is built - slowly and with great difficulty. It will take a long time to complete the long journey from armed conflict to reconciliation. But in Derry at least, people believe that it is time to move on. Free Derry Corner is now seen as part of the city's history, a place for respect and conservation, but no longer a rallying point for rebellion against the state.",

      "bodyText": "The consultant pathologist accused of taking organs from hundreds of children at the Alder Hey Hospital in Liverpool without their parents' consent has claimed that the remains of at least two unidentified children found among his belongings in a Canadian warehouse are his property. Professor Dick van Velzen, an expert in paediatric pathology who could be extradited this week after Canadian police issued an arrest warrant, has dismissed the move as 'a misunderstanding' and insisted that the remains were given to him by the children's parents. 'The tissues recovered are not body parts or the remains of deceased children, as the police seem to understand,' he said. 'They are small parts of diseased bowel tissue which were removed by surgeons as part of routine operations elsewhere.

The warrant was issued by police in Nova Scotia yesterday. Velzen, who left Britain in 1995, is at the centre of three inquiries into how the organs of more than 800 children were removed without their parents' consent. The latest discovery has horrified parents in Liverpool, many of whom have already been forced to hold second funerals for their children because they had been buried without major organs. The Canadian authorities say it will take at least six months before tests can establish from the remains found yesterday the children's place of origin. The helpline at Alder Hey Hospital has been overwhelmed by frantic parents agonising over the possibility that their children's organs may be in Canada. 'This is a nightmare for every parent who had a child of about that age who died at Alder Hey during Velzen's time there,' said Janet Valentine, who has still not recovered all the organs of her five-month-old daughter, who died during heart surgery at the hospital in 1990. 'I've had parents who are beside themselves with terror ringing me all morning.' The discovery was made by warehouse staff in Dartmouth who had moved in to recover the doctor's belongings, which had been stored since May 1998, after he failed to return to collect them or to pay for further storage.

'If you said to any constitutional expert, how would you devise a form of federal government for the United Kingdom, this is not what he would come up with because it lacks the equilibrium a federal structure enjoys in other countries... But it may all be part of the evolution of the constitution.'</p> <p>She recognises the Nationalists, under their new leader John Swinney, believe the Parliament is a passport to independence. She says there may have to be a 'vigorous' debate to test whether such an idea would not be 'dangerous lunacy'. She thinks it is the duty of three unionist parties in the Parliament to resist any such idea.</p> <p>'There's a huge obligation on the parties which believe in the United Kingdom to start demonstrating to the people of Scotland that a devolved Parliament can deliver for them, and has the capacity to envisage a better life for them.'</p> <p>For Goldie herself the Parliament is clearly an absorbing experience. What the Tories offer, she says, is a 'manageable' agenda. She promises 'prudence' and warns against unsustainable spending programmes.</p> <p>For all her criticisms of the Executive, she remains hopeful about the Parliament's future. It has the chance to make meaningful improvements to public services, to support the university sector and to reverse Scotland's indifference to the enterprise culture. 'And we can do all this within the United Kingdom. There's a very, very exciting future.'</p>",

She says the Executive is perceived as a 'puppet of London'. 'It's a control regime, and I think that ethos of control comes from the Prime Minister - I don't think there's any question of that. The Scottish Executive feels inhibited. And that to me is highly, highly dangerous because that could be a repressive influence on devolution instead of allowing devolution to breathe, and evolve.' The other consequence of devolution, she believes, is that 'as time goes past and as circumstances emerge there probably will be a need to look at some of the powers and see if any amendment is needed.' She sees the UK constitution moving towards a 'lopsided' federalism. 'If you said to any constitutional expert, how would you devise a form of federal government for the United Kingdom, this is not what he would come up with because it lacks the equilibrium a federal structure enjoys in other countries... But it may all be part of the evolution of the constitution.' She recognises the Nationalists, under their new leader John Swinney, believe the Parliament is a passport to independence. She says there may have to be a 'vigorous' debate to test whether such an idea would not be 'dangerous lunacy'. She thinks it is the duty of three unionist parties in the Parliament to resist any such idea. 'There's a huge obligation on the parties which believe in the United Kingdom to start demonstrating to the people of Scotland that a devolved Parliament can deliver for them, and has the capacity to envisage a better life for them.' For Goldie herself the Parliament is clearly an absorbing experience. What the Tories offer, she says, is a 'manageable' agenda. She promises 'prudence' and warns against unsustainable spending programmes. For all her criticisms of the Executive, she remains hopeful about the Parliament's future. It has the chance to make meaningful improvements to public services, to support the university sector and to reverse Scotland's indifference to the enterprise culture. 'And we can do all this within the United Kingdom. There's a very, very exciting future.'",

Mystery still hangs over his death given that he appeared to have been beaten up and a crossbow bolt was found wedged in the wall of the room where his body was discovered. His life however, in particular those 10 or so years he spent at the cutting edge of the UDA's killing machine, embodies the sub-culture of sectarianism and violence that characterised the second generation of working-class Protestants that emerged from loyalist ghettos during the Troubles.</p> <p>McKeag, like others from 'C' company, graduated from the street violence of the skinhead cult to the junior UDA, the Ulster Young Militants. They came into their own at the end of 1989 when a major investigation into collusion between loyalist paramilitaries and the security forces led by the Metropolitan police commissioner Sir John Stevens led to several arrests of key UDA figures.</p> <p>A number of those charged with terrorist offences such as Tommy 'Tucker' Lyttle were regarded by younger loyalists as soft touches who had allowed the UDA's armed campaign to be wound down. Lyttle, it later emerged, was an informer for the RUC Special Branch.</p> <p>With the old guard in the UDA out of the way, the younger, more militant members seized control of the organisation's ruling body, the Inner Council.</p> <p>Once in power, these young, visceral sectarians embarked on a murder campaign directed at times against republican activists but more often simply against ordinary members of the nationalist community. By 1991 and 1992 loyalists, principally the UDA, were outkilling the IRA for the first time.</p> <p>McKeag became one of the UDA's most important assassins in the period between 1990 and the loyalist ceasefire four years later. Of the dozen or so Catholics he murdered, the RUC can pinpoint two specific incidents. In 1993 the UDA shot dead a young shop assistant in a chemist on the Springfield Road in West Belfast. Their intended target had been the sister of a prominent Sinn Fein official but as so often happens in Northern Ireland the killers picked the wrong person. Eyewitnesses who saw the murder gang drive off towards Lanark Way, a main arterial route linking Catholic and Protestant west Belfast, reported that the killers shouted inexplicably: 'Follow the yellow brick road.' One of the gunmen was Stephen McKeag.</p> <p>A year later UDA gunmen entered a hairdresser's shop on the Donegall Road, just off the Falls, and shot dead Sean Hughes. The RUC believe the gunman was McKeag even though the case against him collapsed in court due to the judge's doubts over witness identification.</p> <p>Yet even after the UDA along with the UVF called their ceasefire on October 1994 - just three months after the IRA's historic cessation - McKeag continued to kill. The green light to reactivate the UDA killer gangs came about following the murder of Billy 'King Rat' Wright inside the Maze prison two days after Christmas 1997.</p> <p>Wright had been expelled from the UVF the previous year and formed the anti-ceasefire Loyalist Volunteer Force. His plan had been to build a new alliance with those UDA battalions such as 'C' company on the Shankill which were sceptical about the ceasefire and the peace process. Wright won the admiration and trust of a number of young loyalists including McKeag.</p> <p>By this time McKeag was now the 'commanding officer' of 'C' company because Johnny Adair was in prison, facing 15 years for directing acts of terrorism. Just over a week after the Irish National Liberation Army shot Wright dead in the Maze, McKeag and his colleagues decided to break the ceasefire. They attacked a number of Catholic pubs including the Clifton Tavern in north Belfast, nicknamed fatally by local nationalists as 'the suicide inn'. During that attack in January 1998 McKeag shot dead Edmund Trainor and wounded three other customers.</p> <p>Such was his standing within the violent underworld of loyalist paramilitarism that McKeag even usurped Johnny Adair as a hero figure. When Adair was released early from prison under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement in September last year the LVF held a welcome home party for him in Lurgan, Co Armagh. Adair was given a rousing ovation from LVF members and supporters inside a social club. But this was nothing compared to the standing ovation awarded to McKeag, who was called on to the stage and smothered in praise for his role in sectarian assassinations.</p> <p>Yet within six months 'Top Gun' had fallen out of favour with 'C' company's leadership. A series of brawls inside loyalist shebeens and the beating of a number of women involved in a local dispute resulted in McKeag being ordered off the Shankill by his UDA colleagues. He only came back to live in the area when the inter-loyalist feud erupted in late August. Adair and his comrades thought he might be useful in their war with the Shankill UVF.</p> <p>McKeag, however, was understood to be opposed to killing loyalists, albeit rival ones. He took no part in the feuding and according to UVF sources was not regarded as a target.</p> <p>It is known that McKeag had become increasingly addicted to cocaine and was taking the drug when he died. The danger of snorting huge amounts of cocaine was compounded by the fact that he was on highly potent pain killers for injuries sustained during a motorcycle accident in north Belfast six months ago. The car his bike crashed into belonged to a senior member of the UVF, although both factions regarded the collision as an accident.</p> <p>Among the hundreds of wreaths left at his graveside in Roselawn cemetery last week were tiny silver and gold guns - a token of his other addiction, murder. Two wreaths, 10 foot wide, spelled out 'Top Gun'.</p>",

A number of those charged with terrorist offences such as Tommy 'Tucker' Lyttle were regarded by younger loyalists as soft touches who had allowed the UDA's armed campaign to be wound down. Lyttle, it later emerged, was an informer for the RUC Special Branch. With the old guard in the UDA out of the way, the younger, more militant members seized control of the organisation's ruling body, the Inner Council. Once in power, these young, visceral sectarians embarked on a murder campaign directed at times against republican activists but more often simply against ordinary members of the nationalist community. By 1991 and 1992 loyalists, principally the UDA, were outkilling the IRA for the first time. McKeag became one of the UDA's most important assassins in the period between 1990 and the loyalist ceasefire four years later. Of the dozen or so Catholics he murdered, the RUC can pinpoint two specific incidents. In 1993 the UDA shot dead a young shop assistant in a chemist on the Springfield Road in West Belfast. Their intended target had been the sister of a prominent Sinn Fein official but as so often happens in Northern Ireland the killers picked the wrong person. Eyewitnesses who saw the murder gang drive off towards Lanark Way, a main arterial route linking Catholic and Protestant west Belfast, reported that the killers shouted inexplicably: 'Follow the yellow brick road.' One of the gunmen was Stephen McKeag. A year later UDA gunmen entered a hairdresser's shop on the Donegall Road, just off the Falls, and shot dead Sean Hughes. The RUC believe the gunman was McKeag even though the case against him collapsed in court due to the judge's doubts over witness identification. Yet even after the UDA along with the UVF called their ceasefire on October 1994 - just three months after the IRA's historic cessation - McKeag continued to kill. The green light to reactivate the UDA killer gangs came about following the murder of Billy 'King Rat' Wright inside the Maze prison two days after Christmas 1997. Wright had been expelled from the UVF the previous year and formed the anti-ceasefire Loyalist Volunteer Force. His plan had been to build a new alliance with those UDA battalions such as 'C' company on the Shankill which were sceptical about the ceasefire and the peace process. Wright won the admiration and trust of a number of young loyalists including McKeag. By this time McKeag was now the 'commanding officer' of 'C' company because Johnny Adair was in prison, facing 15 years for directing acts of terrorism. Just over a week after the Irish National Liberation Army shot Wright dead in the Maze, McKeag and his colleagues decided to break the ceasefire. They attacked a number of Catholic pubs including the Clifton Tavern in north Belfast, nicknamed fatally by local nationalists as 'the suicide inn'. During that attack in January 1998 McKeag shot dead Edmund Trainor and wounded three other customers. Such was his standing within the violent underworld of loyalist paramilitarism that McKeag even usurped Johnny Adair as a hero figure. When Adair was released early from prison under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement in September last year the LVF held a welcome home party for him in Lurgan, Co Armagh. Adair was given a rousing ovation from LVF members and supporters inside a social club. But this was nothing compared to the standing ovation awarded to McKeag, who was called on to the stage and smothered in praise for his role in sectarian assassinations. Yet within six months 'Top Gun' had fallen out of favour with 'C' company's leadership. A series of brawls inside loyalist shebeens and the beating of a number of women involved in a local dispute resulted in McKeag being ordered off the Shankill by his UDA colleagues. He only came back to live in the area when the inter-loyalist feud erupted in late August. Adair and his comrades thought he might be useful in their war with the Shankill UVF. McKeag, however, was understood to be opposed to killing loyalists, albeit rival ones. He took no part in the feuding and according to UVF sources was not regarded as a target. It is known that McKeag had become increasingly addicted to cocaine and was taking the drug when he died. The danger of snorting huge amounts of cocaine was compounded by the fact that he was on highly potent pain killers for injuries sustained during a motorcycle accident in north Belfast six months ago. The car his bike crashed into belonged to a senior member of the UVF, although both factions regarded the collision as an accident. Among the hundreds of wreaths left at his graveside in Roselawn cemetery last week were tiny silver and gold guns - a token of his other addiction, murder. Two wreaths, 10 foot wide, spelled out 'Top Gun'.",

      "body": "<p>It's highly confusing, meeting Kanya King. I don't mean just because of the music-talk stuff, though there is that ...the myriad fine gradations between hip and hop and house, garage and bhangra and gangsta and jungle and trip hop and rap.</p> <p>I think I've got the fundamentals sorted out: house is the stuff that sounds like a giant moron banging in an endless nail with his head, whereas hip hop is the stuff that sounds like four hours of a photocopier warming up. (And no, I'm not being patronising: it's just that if you really don't know, and are at that stage in life where the only bits in the songs that you recognise are the samples stolen from old Steely Dan tracks, then it's terribly trendy-vicar and Mr Tony to try to pretend. Suffice it to say that, according to age, class, number of drugs taken and the increasingly less important factor of race, some of it sounds absurdly glorious and some of it makes your brain bleed.)</p> <p>The confusing thing about Kanya herself, talking about race and class and music, is that she is so relentlessly, hopelessly, nice about everything, to the point of saccharinity.</p> <p>This is a woman born the youngest of a 'very poor' black-Irish family of nine, whose Ghanaian father died when she was 13, whose mother can recall the signs in London which said 'no blacks, no Irish, no dogs' and struggled not only to find them a home but to protect them from the hate-mail and racist packages.</p> <p>Who put herself through college and then, while trying to promote black bands, found herself up against one of the most cynical, white-run businesses in our cynical, white global marketplace. Who then had to fight the business's even more cynical nephew, the 'enlightened' producers who were happy to film black music being made, but only if in a seedy club, with bands that turned up shambolically late or not at all, and perhaps a shooting or two thrown in for good measure. Yo, blood.</p> <p>So you would understand it if Kanya, now 30, the woman behind the phenomenally successful Mobo awards - the formula, denoting 'Music Of Black Origin', which has over the past five years proved subtly adept at promoting black music, or black-by-formation music, without ghettoising it - had a few things to say about race, or class, or corporate cynicism. Well, she does, but they're all awfully nice.</p> <p>We are all living in much more enlightened, multi-cultural times, she beams. Of course, white people can make good 'black' music, she says, to my raised eyebrow (she hasn't obviously played in the same Dundee pubs I have, where the Average White Band's legacy used to be mauled thrice nightly): 'I think, you know, any artist, they're influenced by whoever, but they put their own spin on it, which is important.' Hmm.</p> <p>And there's no resentment of the way the corporations have now muscled in on Mobo after five years of growing success. (This week's awards, for instance, are massively sponsored by a major credit-card company who I'm not going to name because they once refused me a card.) 'No, I think it's important for us to work in harmony with the record companies.</p> <p>No resentment at all, because we don't work in isolation, and at the end you want the artists to have record sales.' Every possible bone of contention I throw at her is sweetly batted back with a wide pragmatic smile. It's like being sucker-punched by a g\u00e2teau.</p> <p>Which is perhaps the way it had to be. After years of black music's associations of anger, mistrust and violence, perhaps it was inevitable - though no less ironic for that - that its success, its biggest breakthrough in Britain, should come in such a very Nineties way, through slick marketing, lack of confrontation, sweet smiles from Kanya and a massive dose of pragmatism.</p> <p>'What we've tried to do is not harp on about what's negative, or doesn't work: this is a celebration.'

      "bodyText": "It's highly confusing, meeting Kanya King. I don't mean just because of the music-talk stuff, though there is that ...the myriad fine gradations between hip and hop and house, garage and bhangra and gangsta and jungle and trip hop and rap. I think I've got the fundamentals sorted out: house is the stuff that sounds like a giant moron banging in an endless nail with his head, whereas hip hop is the stuff that sounds like four hours of a photocopier warming up. (And no, I'm not being patronising: it's just that if you really don't know, and are at that stage in life where the only bits in the songs that you recognise are the samples stolen from old Steely Dan tracks, then it's terribly trendy-vicar and Mr Tony to try to pretend. Suffice it to say that, according to age, class, number of drugs taken and the increasingly less important factor of race, some of it sounds absurdly glorious and some of it makes your brain bleed.) The confusing thing about Kanya herself, talking about race and class and music, is that she is so relentlessly, hopelessly, nice about everything, to the point of saccharinity. This is a woman born the youngest of a 'very poor' black-Irish family of nine, whose Ghanaian father died when she was 13, whose mother can recall the signs in London which said 'no blacks, no Irish, no dogs' and struggled not only to find them a home but to protect them from the hate-mail and racist packages. Who put herself through college and then, while trying to promote black bands, found herself up against one of the most cynical, white-run businesses in our cynical, white global marketplace. Who then had to fight the business's even more cynical nephew, the 'enlightened' producers who were happy to film black music being made, but only if in a seedy club, with bands that turned up shambolically late or not at all, and perhaps a shooting or two thrown in for good measure. Yo, blood. So you would understand it if Kanya, now 30, the woman behind the phenomenally successful Mobo awards - the formula, denoting 'Music Of Black Origin', which has over the past five years proved subtly adept at promoting black music, or black-by-formation music, without ghettoising it - had a few things to say about race, or class, or corporate cynicism. Well, she does, but they're all awfully nice. We are all living in much more enlightened, multi-cultural times, she beams. Of course, white people can make good 'black' music, she says, to my raised eyebrow (she hasn't obviously played in the same Dundee pubs I have, where the Average White Band's legacy used to be mauled thrice nightly): 'I think, you know, any artist, they're influenced by whoever, but they put their own spin on it, which is important.' Hmm. And there's no resentment of the way the corporations have now muscled in on Mobo after five years of growing success. (This week's awards, for instance, are massively sponsored by a major credit-card company who I'm not going to name because they once refused me a card.) 'No, I think it's important for us to work in harmony with the record companies. No resentment at all, because we don't work in isolation, and at the end you want the artists to have record sales.' Every possible bone of contention I throw at her is sweetly batted back with a wide pragmatic smile. It's like being sucker-punched by a g\u00e2teau. Which is perhaps the way it had to be. After years of black music's associations of anger, mistrust and violence, perhaps it was inevitable - though no less ironic for that - that its success, its biggest breakthrough in Britain, should come in such a very Nineties way, through slick marketing, lack of confrontation, sweet smiles from Kanya and a massive dose of pragmatism. 'What we've tried to do is not harp on about what's negative, or doesn't work: this is a celebration.' The front seats at Alexandra Palace will be removed for this week's long-sold-out concert to let fans promenade closer to the stage; Henry Wood's legacy lives on in the new Britain, and race war has left the building. One of the oddest things about Mobo, I suggest, is the blinding obviousness of its categorisation. Surely every piece of rock or pop music for the past half-century is 'of black origin'?

      "body": "<p>They called it Operation Starburst, in a nod to the military-style management consultant jargon William Hague still holds dear.</p> <p>Four days ago the unsuspecting voters of the West Midlands awoke to a virtual invasion by the entire Shadow Cabinet.</p> <p>Fanning out across schools, hospitals, pensioners' day centres and police stations, the Tory team had two objectives: reminding the nation who on earth they are, and beginning to weave a story that could stabilise the seesawing polls in their favour. The nation has probably learnt more about the private William Jefferson Hague in the past three days than it bothered to find out in the past three years: from his dad's speeding fines to his overspending on sherry at Oxford (shades of the 14 pints again) to the tricks his makeup artist uses to stop his bald head glistening.</p> <p>But while this avalanche of trivia is ostensibly due to a soft-focus TV documentary and a new biography, it is really triggered by the political turmoil of the past weeks which has left Britain thinking the unthinkable.</p> <p>What if this man could really be the next Prime Minister? And if so, is he really the bluff Yorkshire populist of Smith Square folklore, or is his the more complicated story told by some colleagues of a privately liberal man, reined in by a prejudiced party he expected to have more time to change? Beneath a plastic backdrop of jagged abstract shapes at his party conference, William Hague must this week answer the questions. Tony Blair has faltered, and his rival is pushed blinking into the spotlight to demonstrate that he is capable of forming a government.</p> <p>'What I think we have done this week is prove that Labour are mortal,' says Ann Widdecombe. 'And it's now up to us.' Even some in his own party, as stunned by the sudden lurch in the polls as Labour, are not convinced Hague can do it. There is a sense that this was not in the game plan.</p> <p>'This is a massive opportunity, but the question is can he take it,' says one senior ex-Central Office aide. 'The party has come up in the polls, but he personally hasn't. If the polls said the Tories had edged one point ahead but William's standing had catapulted upwards, that to me would have been more significant.'</p> <p>The first attempt at a convincing narrative about who he and his party are comes tonight, in Channel 4's Just William...and Ffion , the apparently everyday tale of an amiable bloke whose right-wing 'common sense' somehow pitched him seamlessly into the leadership of the Conservative Party, quietly confident of victory at the next election.</p> <p>But it is not the whole story. 'He never took the job anticipating he would win,' says one formerly good friend. 'The best Tory punters were not talking about that, they believed there was no way they could win an election for two terms after the last, some even said three.</p> <p>'He is not like you think at all in private, he is quite liberal or very liberal, and he surrounds himself with very similar people.</p> <p>'But one gets the feeling that he politically or internally is quite hemmed in by either the favours he owes people or having to include people he is relatively scared of, like Widdecombe, or Redwood.'</p> <p>If Hague finds himself under friendly fire this week, it will not be from these two. But other guns are trained upon him. On Tuesday lunchtime, Ken Clarke will chair a pro-euro rally.</p> <p>The timing is provocative. For outside in the bracing winds sweeping Cliff Walk, the plastic Union Jacks and the gilt pound sign badges on blazer lapels will mark out those massing for the Keep the Pound rally, the official anti-euro event.</p> <p>Last year when the two camps' meetings coincided, it all ended in young Eurosceptics hurling peanuts at Michael Heseltine. This year was meant to be different. Friends say the big cats of the Tory Left - Clarke, Heseltine, Leon Brittan and Chris Patten - agreed in early summer not to go for the kill over Europe at the party conference, for the sake of party loyalty.</p> <p>Then came Hague's September mini-manifesto rejecting any further European integration. Clarke was, says an ally, 'spitting tacks' and Brittan, a mentor to the young Hague who bequeathed him his safe seat, was apparently incensed. The gloves will now come off.</p> <p>At least a handbagging from Baroness Thatcher - who has previously publicly disapproved of Hague sharing a pre-marital bed with Ffion, and upstaged him with a glitzy rally for General Pinochet - is unlikely: she is only staying one day.</p> <p>An embarrassing ghost is hovering in the shape of Lord Archer, due in magistrates' court on perjury charges on Tuesday.</p> <p>Hague's own environment spokesman Damian Green will tomorrow warn against a lurch to the right.</p> <p>In a pamphlet called Restoring the Balance, he warns against moralising on voters' sex lives, attacks on the public sector and thinly veiled racism, adding: 'There must be no \"cricket tests\" in the Conservative Party.'</p> <p>The tone Hague wants to strike was set during Starburst, when he visited an inner-city Birmingham comprehensive rather than a leafy suburban grammar.</p> <p>Private polls have shown the Tories creeping ahead in the West Midlands and in the South-east, the electoral weathervanes where Blair's 1997 landslide was won.</p> <p>But recovery here requires more than the die-hard votes of the europhobic hard Right: job losses at Longbridge, grammar schools and hospitals are the 'swing' issues.</p> <p>'There is a swath of middle England who, even if they are not in the inner cities themselves, want to vote for a party that cares about them,' says Social Security spokesman David Willetts.</p> <p>'It is about the decent, well-intentioned middle-aged middle-class people, perhaps a teacher who feels a bit fed up with all the red tape tied up with their school. They don't want to feel they are voting for selfish reasons.'</p> <p>Hague's aides agree. 'We want to demonstrate this week that we are about more than crime, asylum and Europe. It's about an agenda for government, not for opposition.'</p> <p>Hague limbers up for conference seriously. He won't drink all week, eats a carbo-loaded diet heavy on pasta, and works out in the gym of his Richmond home. His trio of speechwriters have spent three days and nights cloistered in Yorkshire, hammering out the speech.</p> <p>His chief policy wonk, Danny Finkelstein, hones the jokes; speechwriter George Osborne furnishes purple prose; adviser Johnathan Caines supplies the experience.</p> <p>But only Hague can muster the one quality which, the focus groups snipe, he lacks so far: statesmanship.</p> <p>He also wants to boost the profiles of his largely anonymous Shadow Cabinet.</p> <p>'In the early days the press said William was nobody and the rest of them were a complete shower,' recalls one senior aide. 'Then they said he was half-competent but the rest were a shower, bar maybe one or two. Now they say he is impressive, but they're interested in the rest.</p> <p>'We could have focused more on policy and more on William as an individual. But the time has come. If they're thinking of voting Conservative, people need to be convinced the Conservative Party is more than just its leader.'</p> <p>Other colleagues doubt however that sweet reason can prevail. Hague's fatal flaw, says one senior Tory, is a failure of nerve against tabloid aggression:</p> <p>'The nine o'clock meetings (when the shadow Cabinet plans its day) increasingly consist of reading out the good bits from the Mail .</p> <p>'If the tabloids will row in behind it we will do it, but it leaves a nasty taste in the mouth. They just can't resist instant gratification.'</p> <p>And while Smith Square has plundered the 'compassionate conservatism' manifesto of George W. Bush for some policy clues, the main lessons drawn from repeated trips to Texas have been hard-headed organisation.</p> <p>'What we have been following in America is how you tackle a skilled campaigner like a Clinton or a Blair when the economy is actually doing well,' says Willetts.</p> <p>'The argument will be this guy comes in in 1997 with the most favourable circumstances in half a century, what more could you ask for, and what has he got to show for it?</p> <p>'Dole was a terrible warning for us. You can't just go around telling everyone the country's in a terrible state, it's too bleak.'</p> <p>Insiders point out that Shadow Chancellor Michael Portillo has quietly ditched predecessor Francis Maude's dire warnings of impending recession.</p> <p>Meanwhile Portillo's own performance will fall under intense scrutiny this week.</p> <p>Last week's unexpected surge for the Tories has unsettled some Portillo groupies still fantasising about a leadership challenge to follow the expected defeat at the next election. If Hague managed to slash Labour's majority to less than 60, his position could be secure after all.</p> <p>Portillo will ensure he is on his most loyal behaviour this week. It could, after all, be the one that determines his future too.</p> <p><b> How governments recover from poll depths</b><br></p> <p><b> Parliament Governing Lowest Vote at next Recovery</b></p> <p><b>Party Rating % Election %</b></p> <p><b>1959-64</b> Conservative 31 43 +12</p> <p><b> 1966-70</b> Labour 28 44 +16</p> <p><b> 1970-74</b> Conservative 31 39 +8</p> <p><b> 1974-79</b> Labour 30 38 +8</p> <p><b> 1979-83</b> Conservative 27 43 +16</p> <p><b> 1983-87</b> Conservative 30 43 +13</p> <p><b> 1987-92</b> Conservative 30 43 +13</p> <p><b> 1992-97</b> Conservative 22 31 +9</p> <p><b> 1997-</b> Labour 34* - -</p> <p>Source: Kellner/Sanders Index *correct to September 2000</p>",

      "bodyText": "They called it Operation Starburst, in a nod to the military-style management consultant jargon William Hague still holds dear. Four days ago the unsuspecting voters of the West Midlands awoke to a virtual invasion by the entire Shadow Cabinet. Fanning out across schools, hospitals, pensioners' day centres and police stations, the Tory team had two objectives: reminding the nation who on earth they are, and beginning to weave a story that could stabilise the seesawing polls in their favour. The nation has probably learnt more about the private William Jefferson Hague in the past three days than it bothered to find out in the past three years: from his dad's speeding fines to his overspending on sherry at Oxford (shades of the 14 pints again) to the tricks his makeup artist uses to stop his bald head glistening. But while this avalanche of trivia is ostensibly due to a soft-focus TV documentary and a new biography, it is really triggered by the political turmoil of the past weeks which has left Britain thinking the unthinkable. What if this man could really be the next Prime Minister? And if so, is he really the bluff Yorkshire populist of Smith Square folklore, or is his the more complicated story told by some colleagues of a privately liberal man, reined in by a prejudiced party he expected to have more time to change? Beneath a plastic backdrop of jagged abstract shapes at his party conference, William Hague must this week answer the questions. Tony Blair has faltered, and his rival is pushed blinking into the spotlight to demonstrate that he is capable of forming a government. 'What I think we have done this week is prove that Labour are mortal,' says Ann Widdecombe. 'And it's now up to us.' Even some in his own party, as stunned by the sudden lurch in the polls as Labour, are not convinced Hague can do it. There is a sense that this was not in the game plan. 'This is a massive opportunity, but the question is can he take it,' says one senior ex-Central Office aide. 'The party has come up in the polls, but he personally hasn't. If the polls said the Tories had edged one point ahead but William's standing had catapulted upwards, that to me would have been more significant.' The first attempt at a convincing narrative about who he and his party are comes tonight, in Channel 4's Just William...and Ffion , the apparently everyday tale of an amiable bloke whose right-wing 'common sense' somehow pitched him seamlessly into the leadership of the Conservative Party, quietly confident of victory at the next election. But it is not the whole story. 'He never took the job anticipating he would win,' says one formerly good friend. 'The best Tory punters were not talking about that, they believed there was no way they could win an election for two terms after the last, some even said three. 'He is not like you think at all in private, he is quite liberal or very liberal, and he surrounds himself with very similar people. 'But one gets the feeling that he politically or internally is quite hemmed in by either the favours he owes people or having to include people he is relatively scared of, like Widdecombe, or Redwood.' If Hague finds himself under friendly fire this week, it will not be from these two. But other guns are trained upon him. On Tuesday lunchtime, Ken Clarke will chair a pro-euro rally. The timing is provocative. For outside in the bracing winds sweeping Cliff Walk, the plastic Union Jacks and the gilt pound sign badges on blazer lapels will mark out those massing for the Keep the Pound rally, the official anti-euro event. Last year when the two camps' meetings coincided, it all ended in young Eurosceptics hurling peanuts at Michael Heseltine. This year was meant to be different. Friends say the big cats of the Tory Left - Clarke, Heseltine, Leon Brittan and Chris Patten - agreed in early summer not to go for the kill over Europe at the party conference, for the sake of party loyalty. Then came Hague's September mini-manifesto rejecting any further European integration. Clarke was, says an ally, 'spitting tacks' and Brittan, a mentor to the young Hague who bequeathed him his safe seat, was apparently incensed. The gloves will now come off. At least a handbagging from Baroness Thatcher - who has previously publicly disapproved of Hague sharing a pre-marital bed with Ffion, and upstaged him with a glitzy rally for General Pinochet - is unlikely: she is only staying one day. An embarrassing ghost is hovering in the shape of Lord Archer, due in magistrates' court on perjury charges on Tuesday. Hague's own environment spokesman Damian Green will tomorrow warn against a lurch to the right. In a pamphlet called Restoring the Balance, he warns against moralising on voters' sex lives, attacks on the public sector and thinly veiled racism, adding: 'There must be no \"cricket tests\" in the Conservative Party.' The tone Hague wants to strike was set during Starburst, when he visited an inner-city Birmingham comprehensive rather than a leafy suburban grammar. Private polls have shown the Tories creeping ahead in the West Midlands and in the South-east, the electoral weathervanes where Blair's 1997 landslide was won. But recovery here requires more than the die-hard votes of the europhobic hard Right: job losses at Longbridge, grammar schools and hospitals are the 'swing' issues. 'There is a swath of middle England who, even if they are not in the inner cities themselves, want to vote for a party that cares about them,' says Social Security spokesman David Willetts. 'It is about the decent, well-intentioned middle-aged middle-class people, perhaps a teacher who feels a bit fed up with all the red tape tied up with their school. They don't want to feel they are voting for selfish reasons.' Hague's aides agree. 'We want to demonstrate this week that we are about more than crime, asylum and Europe. It's about an agenda for government, not for opposition.' Hague limbers up for conference seriously. He won't drink all week, eats a carbo-loaded diet heavy on pasta, and works out in the gym of his Richmond home. His trio of speechwriters have spent three days and nights cloistered in Yorkshire, hammering out the speech. His chief policy wonk, Danny Finkelstein, hones the jokes; speechwriter George Osborne furnishes purple prose; adviser Johnathan Caines supplies the experience. But only Hague can muster the one quality which, the focus groups snipe, he lacks so far: statesmanship. He also wants to boost the profiles of his largely anonymous Shadow Cabinet. 'In the early days the press said William was nobody and the rest of them were a complete shower,' recalls one senior aide. 'Then they said he was half-competent but the rest were a shower, bar maybe one or two. Now they say he is impressive, but they're interested in the rest. 'We could have focused more on policy and more on William as an individual. But the time has come. If they're thinking of voting Conservative, people need to be convinced the Conservative Party is more than just its leader.' Other colleagues doubt however that sweet reason can prevail. Hague's fatal flaw, says one senior Tory, is a failure of nerve against tabloid aggression: 'The nine o'clock meetings (when the shadow Cabinet plans its day) increasingly consist of reading out the good bits from the Mail . 'If the tabloids will row in behind it we will do it, but it leaves a nasty taste in the mouth. They just can't resist instant gratification.' And while Smith Square has plundered the 'compassionate conservatism' manifesto of George W. Bush for some policy clues, the main lessons drawn from repeated trips to Texas have been hard-headed organisation. 'What we have been following in America is how you tackle a skilled campaigner like a Clinton or a Blair when the economy is actually doing well,' says Willetts. 'The argument will be this guy comes in in 1997 with the most favourable circumstances in half a century, what more could you ask for, and what has he got to show for it? 'Dole was a terrible warning for us. You can't just go around telling everyone the country's in a terrible state, it's too bleak.' Insiders point out that Shadow Chancellor Michael Portillo has quietly ditched predecessor Francis Maude's dire warnings of impending recession. Meanwhile Portillo's own performance will fall under intense scrutiny this week. Last week's unexpected surge for the Tories has unsettled some Portillo groupies still fantasising about a leadership challenge to follow the expected defeat at the next election. If Hague managed to slash Labour's majority to less than 60, his position could be secure after all. Portillo will ensure he is on his most loyal behaviour this week. It could, after all, be the one that determines his future too.

Brat behaviour, undignified squabbles over money, followed by rapid decline. It is a story that has rung true since the silent era. But there are plenty of ex-child stars who have found fulfilling lives away from acting. And there are many who have made a happy transition to adult actor. Today's child stars seem saner, but then, we thought that about River Phoenix too.

      "bodyText": "At 14, Billy Elliot star Jamie Bell is carrying the expectations of the British film industry on his narrow shoulders. If everything goes as planned, he will be knocked sideways by the adoration of 12-year-old girls and offers from Hollywood. The traps that might open up are legion. Brat behaviour, undignified squabbles over money, followed by rapid decline. It is a story that has rung true since the silent era. But there are plenty of ex-child stars who have found fulfilling lives away from acting. And there are many who have made a happy transition to adult actor. Today's child stars seem saner, but then, we thought that about River Phoenix too. Mark Morris looks at some of the brightest and the best. JACKIE COOGAN 1914-1984 (USA) Big break: The Kid (1921) A short life: As the cute kid in the big cap alongside Chaplin in The Kid , Coogan became massive internationally at the age of six. He was soon earning millions, but his career faded and his parents spent all the money. Subsequent legislation to protect child stars was known as the Coogan Act. Found improbable fame later in life as the gruesome Uncle Fester in the TV series of The Addams Family . Moral: Never trust your parents FREDDIE BARTHOLOMEW 1924-92 (Ireland) Big break: David Copperfield (1935) A short life: Child star who made the switch to Hollywood aged 11, appearing with Garbo in Anna Karenina (1935) and as Little Lord Fauntleroy (1936). Complained he spent much of his life in court, often in litigation against his aunt. Retired from acting in 1951, and worked in advertising and as a TV producer. Moral: Never trust your aunt. MICKEY ROONEY 1920- (US) Big break: A Midsummer Night's Dream ( 1935) A short life: Worked in films from age six, but became a big star in his early teens in the Andy Hardy movies, and teamed up with fellow child star Judy Garland. Broke by the early Fifties, he kept working and has prospered ever since, having one of the longest careers in film history. Has been married eight times. In years to come: There won't be a wife No 9, surely? SHIRLEY TEMPLE 1928- (USA) Big break: Stand Up and Cheer (1934) A short life: The biggest child star of them all. Between the ages of six and 10, Temple's dimpled charm made her the world's most popular film star. Her career faded as she hit her teens and she made her final film in 1949. Switched to politics and diplomacy. Has served as a US ambassador. In years to come: Don't bet on an end to the 50-year retirement. JUDY GARLAND 1922-1969 (US) Big break: The Wizard of Oz (1939) A short life: A vaudeville performer who became a film star at 15. She became a legend with The Wizard Of Oz. Her popularity coincided with abuse by the studios, including the use of diet pills that led to addiction. Erratic behaviour damaged her career. Married four times. Died of an overdose. Moral: Never trust the studios. JOHN HOWARD DAVIES 1939- (UK) Big break: Oliver Twist (1948) A short life: At nine, he played Oliver in David Lean's classic Dickens adaptation. Made his final film as an actor three years later. Has been involved as producer, director or Head Of Comedy in the BBC in many of themost significant British TV comedies, including Monty Python's Flying Circus, The Fall And Rise Of Reginald Perrin and Not The Nine O'Clock News . In years to come: No one will dare refer to him as an ex-child star. HAYLEY MILLS 1946- (UK) Big break: Tiger Bay (1959) A short life: Daughter of John Mills, her appearance in Tiger Bay at age 13 led to Disney contract which made her the child star of the early Sixties. Tried reinventing herself with kitchen sink comedy The Family Way (1969). Now more a stage actress, and often featured in Hello! In years to come: Will show us her lovely home, frequently. RON HOWARD 1954- (US) Big break: Andy Griffith Show (TV, 1960-68) A short life: All-American kid hard to avoid on TV and in the movies in the Sixties and Seventies, hitting 'adolescence' (at 19) with American Graffiti and Happy Days . Largely gave up acting in the early Eighties to become a successful director with the likes of Parenthood, Apollo 13 and Ransom. Next film: How The Grinch Stole Christmas. In years to come: Will have enough money to rebuild Fifties Milwaukee in its entirety. HEATHER RIPLEY 1961- (UK) Big break: Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968) A short life: Made her sole screen appearance age seven as Jemima in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. Later became a model, before training as an optician. Then became an eco-protester, camping at Newbury and the Faslane naval base. In years to come: Will be trying to bring down global capitalism. KURT RUSSELL 1951- (US) Big break: The Horse In The Grey Flannel Suit (1968) A short life: Charmer in Disney TV shows and movies from the age of 12.

DAVID BRADLEY 1955- (UK) Big break: Kes (1969) A short life: Miner's son from Barnsley chosen at 14 by Ken Loach to play Billy Casper in Kes.

In years to come: Hopefully not working in a 'We used to have mines round here' theme park. MARK LESTER 1958- (UK) Big break: Oliver! A short life: Was an experienced actor by the time he charmed the nation aged 10 in Oliver! His career had ground to a halt by 1978. Now lives in Cheltenham and works as an osteopath. In the future: People will still ask 'Are you that Mark Lester?' JENNY AGUTTER 1952- (UK) Big break: The Railway Children (1970) A short life: Had been in a 1967 TV version of The Railway Children, and was 18 when real stardom came with the film. Went on to significant roles in Walkabout and An American Werewolf In London. Has never been short of work, and came full circle by playing the mother in ITV's production of The Railway Children . In years to come: Will still have to deal with the crushes of middle-aged journalists. TATUM O'NEAL 1963- (US) Big break: Paper Moon (1973) A short life: Was the then youngest Oscar-winner for her precocious performance in Paper Moon, aged nine, alongside her father, Ryan.

JODIE FOSTER 1962- (US) Big break: Taxi Driver (1976) A short life: Disney-trained 13-year-old shocked audiences everywhere as Iris, the child prostitute.

The Yugoslav President, who is the subject of a sealed indictment from the War Crimes Tribunal, was yesterday still insisting that elections must go to a second round between he and opposition leader Vojislav Kostunica despite overwhelming evidence that the opposition won last weekend's elections.

The Observer understands the proposal was first floated during a visit to Moscow last week by German Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, who was instrumental during the war in Kosovo in persuading Russia to mediate with Milosevic over Nato conditions. The Foreign Office yesterday confirmed that Foreign Secretary Robin Cook had had two lengthy telephone conversations with Ivanov over the Belgrade situation on Friday night and on Saturday, after similar talks with his opposite numbers in Europe and Washington. Despite the inevitable outcry if Milosevic were allowed to escape prosecution, opinion in the US and Europe is leaning towards removal of Milosevic from the scene and a peaceful transition to democracy in rump Yugoslavia that could be threatened by a trial.

      "bodyText": "Bernard Arnault, chairman of the LVMH luxury goods group and one of France's richest businessmen, is looking to buy a controlling interest in Sotheby's, the embattled auction house. Senior LVMH sources told The Observer this weekend that Arnault has renewed his interest in Sotheby's. The news follows a decision last week by Sotheby's major shareholder, US shopping centre tycoon Alfred Taubman, to pay \u00a3130 million out of his own pocket to compensate victims of an alleged price-fixing racket with rival group Christie's. This has prompted intense speculation that Taubman will finance this payout by selling his controlling interest in the 226-year-old house. It is understood that investment bank Goldman Sachs is advising Taubman. An LVMH spokesman said: 'We made an approach earlier this year (for Sotheby's). That proves we were interested in it. It's fair to say we still have an interest.' The spokesman would not say whether there had been dialogue between the two parties last week. But with a US Department of Justice investigation into the price collusion scandal nearing its completion, it is thought that Taubman, a 75-year-old multi-millionaire, wants out of Sotheby's. If the LVMH raid succeeds, Arnault will be one of the most powerful figures in the art world. He bought the Phillip's auction house last year for \u00a370m. His firm, LVMH, is one of the world's biggest luxury brand owners, with Mo't &amp; Chandon, Louis Vuitton and Givenchy. Sotheby's has a market capitalisation of \u00a3685m. A bid for Taubman's 22 per cent interest and 64 per cent voting rights would have to be over \u00a3350m. Arnault faces possible competition from Henry Kravis, boss of the world's most powerful leveraged buyout group, KKR. Kravis is already a board member at Sotheby's, and rumours in New York suggest he may team up with Ron Baron, who owns about 11 per cent of the house. Amazon, the online books retailer, will also be monitoring the situation. It already has a tie-up with Sotheby's and may want to form a buyout consortium. Sotheby's has had a dreadful year. The investigation and resulting writs from art dealers and shareholders blew a big hole in the auction house's share price: it halved from a peak of $36 before the crisis. However it is back near the $25 mark on the back of takeover speculation.",

She refused to name her source. She is, however, more candidon when Hague's thoughts chime with hers: 'That Jeffrey Archer, I could thump him one. And I tell you what, William was disappointed with him as well, very disappointed.' Mother Goose didn't want Hague to stand for the leadership in 1997, believing the party was entering a long period in the wilderness. It was one of the rare occasions when he ignored her advice about a hostile press. 'He said that they'll turn and we'll end up on top. He's been proved right, and that's what will happen. I'm convinced we'll win.'",

Underlying the relationship between the court and the issues of both abortion and the death penalty is the notion of 'states' rights' and federalism - the core of American constitutional politics. Justice Rehnquist has made the defence of 'states rights' his hallmark, and his Supreme Court has knocked back the expansion of federal law to a degree that even prevented the criminalisation of possession of guns in school.",

Five years ago all systems failed as it entered Karlovassi port on Samos and he averted disaster by steering with anchors. He later said: 'Did God shine a light on me? In these situations other powers are at work.'</p> <p>Minoan Flying Dolphins, a subsidiary of Minoan Lines, which renamed the ship Express Samina, says inspectors judged it seaworthy.</p> <p>In 1989, when working for another company, Yiannakis grounded the ferry Nirius off the coast of Rhodes, and sank it a month later after crashing into Crete harbour. According to the Greek media he was not on the bridge either time.</p> <p>The improving economy has made jobs on land more attractive than the sea. The annual intake of cadets has plunged from thousands to hundreds. Yiannakis's personality compounded the problem. 'He's a quiet and patient man, perhaps too quiet and patient. He gets saddled with crew no other captains want. Perhaps he should be more assertive,' said Economopoulo.</p> <p>Last Tuesday at 5pm he sailed from Piraeus and headed south-east for Paros, the first of six overnight stops en route to Lipsis island, as he had done six, sometimes eight, times a week for 10 years. Maritime law says he should be on the bridge seven miles from the approach to land but familiarity appears to have bred complacency.</p> <p>A crewman who sailed with him for more than 20 years said: 'He knows these waters like the back of his hand. He does not have to look at charts. Leaving the bridge to junior officers is routine. If he is a criminal then we are all criminals. Other captains are saying \"There but for the grace of God, go I\",' said Economopoulo.</p> <p>Thus was the scene set for tragedy as the Express Samina approached Paros, steaming at 18 knots through gale-force winds and waves.</p> <p>The captain has admitted he left the bridge 'for a little sleep'. Some passengers say he was among the crew members watching a European football match between Hamburg and Panathinaikos. First Officer Anastasios Psychoyos then allegedly left the bridge to flirt with a passenger, leaving the duty helmsman, Panayiotis Gastaglis, alone. Gastaglis claimed he did not see the rocks until 60ft to 90ft ahead because instruments failed to show that wind had thrown him off course. Psychoyos says he raced to the bridge and wrestled with the wheel 600ft from the rocks. But they tore a 300ft gash in the ferry's side. The captain ran to the bridge.</p> <p>Within minutes the vessel was listing. Chaos erupted. About 530 passengers, including over 100 tourists, tumbled into corridors screaming and jostling for life vests. At first the crew did not think the ship would sink. They told people to remain inside.</p> <p>Tourists were luckier. 'We couldn't understand the language, so we made smarter decisions,' said Heidi Hart, 30, of Seattle. Plunging into the sea, the 12 Britons and almost all foreigners survived, picked up by British helicopters and Paros fishing boats. Heroism abounded: conscripts held up babies in the water and donated their vests; crewmen died trying to release a lifeboat. The death toll may rise above 80 as divers explore coves and crack open doors on the starboard side.</p> <p>Branded a murderer by the press, condemned by the government, disowned by his employer, Yiannakis is a broken man. Seafaring unions defend him as a victim of circumstance. A better scapegoat would be Minoan Line, they say. Its monopoly is imperilled: the government could announce shipping's deregulation next week.</p> <p>The boy from Keratsini who made good faces a lifetime in jail. He will never command again.</p>",

Maritime law says he should be on the bridge seven miles from the approach to land but familiarity appears to have bred complacency. A crewman who sailed with him for more than 20 years said: 'He knows these waters like the back of his hand. He does not have to look at charts. Leaving the bridge to junior officers is routine. If he is a criminal then we are all criminals. Other captains are saying \"There but for the grace of God, go I\",' said Economopoulo. Thus was the scene set for tragedy as the Express Samina approached Paros, steaming at 18 knots through gale-force winds and waves. The captain has admitted he left the bridge 'for a little sleep'. Some passengers say he was among the crew members watching a European football match between Hamburg and Panathinaikos. First Officer Anastasios Psychoyos then allegedly left the bridge to flirt with a passenger, leaving the duty helmsman, Panayiotis Gastaglis, alone. Gastaglis claimed he did not see the rocks until 60ft to 90ft ahead because instruments failed to show that wind had thrown him off course. Psychoyos says he raced to the bridge and wrestled with the wheel 600ft from the rocks. But they tore a 300ft gash in the ferry's side. The captain ran to the bridge. Within minutes the vessel was listing. Chaos erupted. About 530 passengers, including over 100 tourists, tumbled into corridors screaming and jostling for life vests. At first the crew did not think the ship would sink. They told people to remain inside. Tourists were luckier. 'We couldn't understand the language, so we made smarter decisions,' said Heidi Hart, 30, of Seattle. Plunging into the sea, the 12 Britons and almost all foreigners survived, picked up by British helicopters and Paros fishing boats. Heroism abounded: conscripts held up babies in the water and donated their vests; crewmen died trying to release a lifeboat. The death toll may rise above 80 as divers explore coves and crack open doors on the starboard side. Branded a murderer by the press, condemned by the government, disowned by his employer, Yiannakis is a broken man. Seafaring unions defend him as a victim of circumstance. A better scapegoat would be Minoan Line, they say. Its monopoly is imperilled: the government could announce shipping's deregulation next week. The boy from Keratsini who made good faces a lifetime in jail. He will never command again.",

Even the current Communist leader, Robert Hue, and his predecessor, Georges Marchais, faced a judicial investigation over misplaced party funds in 1996. Indeed, what has been most astounding down the years, for those enamoured of purported Anglo-Saxon probity, is that France seems to be another country in which public funds are often treated as spoils to be carved up for private gain. How else can one explain the \u00a320,000 given by a now-jailed RPR official to Xavi\u00e8re Tiberi, wife of the mayor of Paris, for a 36-page report which she largely plagiarised from a textbook? Or the case of former RPR Prime Minister Alain Jupp\u00e9 who, while he was in charge of Paris's finances in the early Nineties, rented flats for himself and three members of his family at far below market rents and arranged that his own luxury apartment be refurbished at a cost to the council of more than \u00a3100,000? Corruption hasn't just been a Parisian problem: the mayors of cities such as Lyons and Grenoble were disgraced during corruption scandals in the Eighties and early Nineties. Nice's mayor even flew off to Uruguay to avoid criminal charges and a bill for \u00a32m in unpaid taxes. The French hoped to put all this behind them when, in 1994, Prime Minister Edouard Balladur banned all party funding by companies. Today only individuals can contribute to party coffers. But the scandals continue, and these donations are topped up by some state support. Chirac is not obliged to say anything on the M\u00e9ry case, because presidential privilege prevents him from being questioned or charged over the affair. But one of the most sophisticated electorates in the world, which may or may not return him as president in 2002 or before, might well appreciate it if he did.",

Anti-capitalist activists carried placards lambasting McDonald's, but it is the sort of stick Sony has avoided. </p> <p>All that is likely to change, however, as news gets around that the entertainment and technology giant advocates spying on eco-friendly groups who criticise those same sleek, ergonomic lines on its products. </p> <p>It sounds like something out of a futuristic dystopia. It is also true. Earlier this summer, to representatives of the European Information and Communications Technology Industry Association in Brussels, Andrew Baynes, project manager at Sony International (Europe), made Sony's pitch against eco-activism. Sony's problem with the greenies is this: its products contain toxins and are difficult to dispose of. Environmentalists would like tougher controls. Sony wants to avoid them. </p> <p>Its strategy is outlined in a leaked paper currently doing the rounds of the alternative internet community. Titled 'NGO Strategy', it bears all the Cold War histrionics of J. Edgar Hoover's G-Men. The document discloses the names, contacts and internet addresses of leading environmental groups that pose a public relations threat to the company - the Northern Alliance for Sustainability, Greenpeace, the European Environment Bureau, the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition and Friends of the Earth. </p> <p>The electronics industry, including Sony, has been fighting efforts by environmentalists who would prefer the manufacturers to take responsibility for environmental and health hazards of product disposal. In the EU, these efforts have culminated in the European Commission Directive on Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment - or WEEE. The proposed law would force manufacturers such as Sony to take financial responsibility for managing their products throughout their life cycle, a period that includes disposal. Compulsory targets for collection will be set in 2006 - when between 70 and 90 per cent by weight of all collected equipment must be recycled or re-used. The directive would further propose the phasing out by 2008 of mercury, lead, cadmium and other toxic chemicals commonly used by the electronics industry. </p> <p>The cost to the electronics industry could be astronomical. And since the European legislation surfaced several years ago, the American Electronic Association - an industrial umbrella organisation for more than 3,000 companies, including IBM, Microsoft, Motorola and Intel - has launched a major offensive against extended producer responsibility. The AEA says the legislation contradicts World Trade Organisation code. </p> <p>Sony's presentation makes for sobering reading - after three global demonstrations in the last year, are NGOs still to be characterised as subversive operatives? 'NGO Activity to watch out for!' reads page five - with added links to literature published online by Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace. The environmental organisations are further identified as 'highly active' and 'well organised' with a 'global reach'. </p> <p>'Don't wait!!' is the mandate from the Sony report to company personnel. Sony's recommendation is the hiring of corporate press officers as rapid reaction units. And the preparation of industry-wide template responses - as opposed to the dribs and drabs of contradicting information usually associated with press offices. </p> <p>So far, you might think, Sony's is the response indicative of any corporate behemoth facing the prospect of having to take responsibility for its products. But then follows the punch line. The presentation suggests the electronics industry employ 'web investigation agencies' as a solution to pesky online critics. London-based Infonic Plc are the web snoops recommended by Sony. </p> <p>Infonic's website is a defiant call to arms for blue-chip companies besieged by online activists following the swell of protests in Seattle, Washington and, more recently, Prague. 'Suddenly a company's voice is no longer louder than that of its leading critics. Activists, customers, journalists and employees are talking to each other like never before, with big business finding it increasingly difficult to stay in the conversation.' </p> <p>The internet detectives boast few morals in terms of the clients they take on. Infonic first rose to prominence when the company was hired by Shell International to decipher the internet as a barometer for public opinion in the aftermath of Greenpeace's victorious occupation of the Brent Spar oil platform in 1995. Other clients featured on the company website include British Airways, Levis Strauss &amp; Co and Unilever. </p> <p>The use of internet trawlers like Infonic to specifically monitor NGOs sets a precedent in the commercial sector. The monitoring of internet-friendly activists has, in recent years, taken on an alarming momentum. The Big Brother of internet investigation agencies, America's E:Watch, helps more than 800 of the world's largest corporations keep track of their reputations across cyberspace. A watchful eye on the antics of corporate protesters, naturally, is a priority. E:Watch clients include the H. J. Heinz company and Northwest Airlines. 'You'll hear rumours before they start to spread,' assures its website. 'You'll be among the first to find out about negative or inaccurate information - instead of the last.' </p> <p>Commercial companies using internet detectives to snoop around the websites of their detractors? It sounds like an alarming development in the information war. Until now, the activities of protest groups have traditionally been monitored by governmental agencies. Last May, the Paris-based 'Intelligence Newsletter' reported that reserve units from US Army Intelligence were deployed to monitor the 16-18 April protests against the IMF and World Bank in Washington. 'The Pentagon sent around 700 men from the Intelligence and Security Command at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, to assist the Washington police on 17 April, including specialists in human and signals intelligence,' the report said. </p> <p>According to the newsletter, activist files are being circulated via the Regional Information Sharing System, a networked database used by 5,300 law enforcement agencies in the US, the FBI, the US Drug Enforcement Administration, the Internal Revenue Service, the Secret Service, US Customs and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. The activities of anarchic groups detailed by RISS include findings on Greenpeace, the American Indian Movement and the Zapatista National Liberation Front. </p> <p>Sony's advocacy of Infonic, on the face of it, might not amount to anything more than a smear campaign against the likes of Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth. But environmental organisations that rely on funding for survival could find themselves crippled in the face of unsubstantiated rumours. 'People on the boards of foundations are very much part of the establishment,' says Iza Kruszewska, spokesperson for the Northern Alliance for Sustainability. 'Big corporations hold a powerful sway over their opinions on funding NGOs.' </p> <p>The nervous shiver that characterises the language employed by the Sony report has been met with mild bemusement by the various environmental organisations named within its pages. California's Silicon Valley Toxic Coalition employs no more than 14 staffers at its San Jose offices. 'There's little need for web investigation agencies,' laughs Ted Smith, its executive director. 'We're hardly a Fortune 500 company. If they want to know anything about us, all Sony has to do is read our website.'</p>",

The Big Brother of internet investigation agencies, America's E:Watch, helps more than 800 of the world's largest corporations keep track of their reputations across cyberspace. A watchful eye on the antics of corporate protesters, naturally, is a priority. E:Watch clients include the H. J. Heinz company and Northwest Airlines. 'You'll hear rumours before they start to spread,' assures its website. 'You'll be among the first to find out about negative or inaccurate information - instead of the last.' Commercial companies using internet detectives to snoop around the websites of their detractors? It sounds like an alarming development in the information war. Until now, the activities of protest groups have traditionally been monitored by governmental agencies. Last May, the Paris-based 'Intelligence Newsletter' reported that reserve units from US Army Intelligence were deployed to monitor the 16-18 April protests against the IMF and World Bank in Washington. 'The Pentagon sent around 700 men from the Intelligence and Security Command at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, to assist the Washington police on 17 April, including specialists in human and signals intelligence,' the report said. According to the newsletter, activist files are being circulated via the Regional Information Sharing System, a networked database used by 5,300 law enforcement agencies in the US, the FBI, the US Drug Enforcement Administration, the Internal Revenue Service, the Secret Service, US Customs and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. The activities of anarchic groups detailed by RISS include findings on Greenpeace, the American Indian Movement and the Zapatista National Liberation Front. Sony's advocacy of Infonic, on the face of it, might not amount to anything more than a smear campaign against the likes of Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth. But environmental organisations that rely on funding for survival could find themselves crippled in the face of unsubstantiated rumours. 'People on the boards of foundations are very much part of the establishment,' says Iza Kruszewska, spokesperson for the Northern Alliance for Sustainability. 'Big corporations hold a powerful sway over their opinions on funding NGOs.' The nervous shiver that characterises the language employed by the Sony report has been met with mild bemusement by the various environmental organisations named within its pages. California's Silicon Valley Toxic Coalition employs no more than 14 staffers at its San Jose offices. 'There's little need for web investigation agencies,' laughs Ted Smith, its executive director. 'We're hardly a Fortune 500 company. If they want to know anything about us, all Sony has to do is read our website.'",

      "body": "<p>Picture the future frontline of the automobile war. Scene one. You're gridlocked on the M25 for more than an hour. By the time you come off Britain's longest car park you've bought some shares, booked a restaurant and arranged to view a house for sale nearby. As you leave the motorway a voice from the car's onboard computer directs you to the property. </p> <p>Scene two. Your car has overturned. You're unconscious, but the airbag has cushioned the impact, and triggered an alarm system which alerted the emergency services. The ambulance will find you, because the car has a global positioning system. </p> <p>Scene three. The petrol tank is low. A display beamed on to your rear-view mirror shows you the nearest petrol station which is offering you a free car wash. </p> <p>Scene four. Although you don't know it, a car accident 15 miles ahead means you are heading for long delays. A screen built into your dashboard plots an alternative route. Meanwhile, your engine's computer diagnostics system uses the internet to book the car in for a check-up at your local garage </p> <p>Fanciful? Maybe now, but not in five years' time. Telematics - providing information and services to cars using telecommunications - is new in Britain now, but it is set to be the Next Big Thing. It is already being talked about in the hushed tones analysts used to describe e-commerce five years ago. </p> <p>The predictions made for the exponential growth rate of telematics business are astounding. One of the biggest players in the market, US-based firm Delphi, suggests that half of all new cars could have telematic devices fitted as standard by 2005. </p> <p>The Economist Intelligence Unit predicts that more than 4 million cars sold in Western Europe in 2005 will have onboard navigation systems. And analysts at Deutsche Bank predicts that the telematics market will grow from $1 billion in 1998 to $42bn in 2010. </p> <p>Turning cars into mobile super computers is driven by forecasts of unprecedented congestion. Telematics help drivers find ways around the jams or, failing that, connects them to the wired world so that while stuck in traffic, they can communicate as efficiently as if they were at home or in the office. After all, some people practically live in their cars already. US consumers spend a whopping 500 million hours a week in their vehicles. In Europe, between 50 and 70 per cent of all mobile phone minutes are accounted for by drivers. </p> <p>Apart from cutting journey times, telematics' proponents argue that it reduces anxiety. 'When drivers know the nature and extent of a problem, they get less stressed about it,' said Bill McIntosh, financial director at Traffic-master, the UK company rolling out a pan-European vehicle navigation system. </p> <p>The firm's roadside sensors monitor the state of traffic. The information is processed and sent to drivers, via either mobile phones or devices built into cars. Trafficmaster users can also opt to pay for a tracking system that monitors vehicles' whereabouts - handy for, say, haulage firms worried about thefts. </p> <p>But it is not just technically savvy companies such as Trafficmaster which are excited about telematics. The big motor manufacturers, are disciples too, hoping that sales of this hi-tech kit will improve their tight margins. </p> <p>General Motors is attempting to dominate the market with its OnStar system. Originally available only on GM luxury models, OnStar has been developed from a navigation and emergency response system to embrace other multimedia functions, such as video and email. </p> <p>Significantly, GM is offering other carmakers the chance to fit OnStar, which suggests the firm will soon look to float off this business. </p> <p>Analysts at Deutsche Bank predicted last May that OnStar could generate revenues of $4bn by 2005. </p> <p>Meanwhile, rival Ford's Connect telematics system could be worth $3.2bn in five years. Earlier this year Ford unveiled prototype cars called 24-7s. These all have integrated telematic systems which, apart from turning vehicles into something like Kit, the camp-sounding onboard computer featured in the TV series Knight Rider, allow you to 'personalise' your car interior using a voice activation system. Want a pink dashboard? Just tell the car that's the mood you're in. </p> <p>The Economist Intelligence Unit says around 20 per cent of the value of an executive's car is based on its electronics systems. By 2005 this will reach 30 per cent. </p> <p>In addition, motor manufacturers know that by developing telematics systems they can can cut content deals with information providers and generate subscription revenues, so easing the cyclical nature of their industry. Ford already has a deal with AOL, while GM has Yahoo! on its side. </p> <p>But will the likes of Ford and GM be able dominate the telematics industry in the long run? McIntosh said: 'The debate will be about who controls the customers. It will be interesting to see whether it is the car manufacturers or the telecoms companies. It's difficult to see how that works out, because the two sectors' planning cycles are very different, and putting anything into a car takes up to five years.' </p> <p>So far the car industry as a whole has been extremely slow in cornering the market. Only 2 per cent of car phones are fitted by the manufacturer; the rest are fitted later. </p> <p>Big mobile phone firms are on the prowl. Vodafone, for instance, has a dedicated telematics arm, and is planning to launch its own vehicle tracking service. The mobile phone giant is talking to a number of carmakers about supplying onboard telematic systems as standard, although it declines to comment on specifics. </p> <p>But the danger is that drivers could soon have too much information. 'The industry needs to be focused,' McIntosh said. 'All this infotainment such as \"where's the nearest hotel, petrol station or golf course\" - where do you draw the line? Clearly, there is an issue of driver overload. There's only a certain amount of information that they can efficiently handle. Safety analysts are now starting to look at telematics.' </p> <p>Nevertheless, telematics is ripe for growth. The words 'information superhighway' have just taken on a whole new meaning.</p>",

By the time you come off Britain's longest car park you've bought some shares, booked a restaurant and arranged to view a house for sale nearby. As you leave the motorway a voice from the car's onboard computer directs you to the property. Scene two. Your car has overturned. You're unconscious, but the airbag has cushioned the impact, and triggered an alarm system which alerted the emergency services. The ambulance will find you, because the car has a global positioning system. Scene three. The petrol tank is low. A display beamed on to your rear-view mirror shows you the nearest petrol station which is offering you a free car wash. Scene four. Although you don't know it, a car accident 15 miles ahead means you are heading for long delays. A screen built into your dashboard plots an alternative route. Meanwhile, your engine's computer diagnostics system uses the internet to book the car in for a check-up at your local garage Fanciful? Maybe now, but not in five years' time. Telematics - providing information and services to cars using telecommunications - is new in Britain now, but it is set to be the Next Big Thing. It is already being talked about in the hushed tones analysts used to describe e-commerce five years ago. The predictions made for the exponential growth rate of telematics business are astounding. One of the biggest players in the market, US-based firm Delphi, suggests that half of all new cars could have telematic devices fitted as standard by 2005. The Economist Intelligence Unit predicts that more than 4 million cars sold in Western Europe in 2005 will have onboard navigation systems. And analysts at Deutsche Bank predicts that the telematics market will grow from $1 billion in 1998 to $42bn in 2010. Turning cars into mobile super computers is driven by forecasts of unprecedented congestion. Telematics help drivers find ways around the jams or, failing that, connects them to the wired world so that while stuck in traffic, they can communicate as efficiently as if they were at home or in the office. After all, some people practically live in their cars already. US consumers spend a whopping 500 million hours a week in their vehicles. In Europe, between 50 and 70 per cent of all mobile phone minutes are accounted for by drivers. Apart from cutting journey times, telematics' proponents argue that it reduces anxiety. 'When drivers know the nature and extent of a problem, they get less stressed about it,' said Bill McIntosh, financial director at Traffic-master, the UK company rolling out a pan-European vehicle navigation system. The firm's roadside sensors monitor the state of traffic. The information is processed and sent to drivers, via either mobile phones or devices built into cars. Trafficmaster users can also opt to pay for a tracking system that monitors vehicles' whereabouts - handy for, say, haulage firms worried about thefts. But it is not just technically savvy companies such as Trafficmaster which are excited about telematics. The big motor manufacturers, are disciples too, hoping that sales of this hi-tech kit will improve their tight margins. General Motors is attempting to dominate the market with its OnStar system. Originally available only on GM luxury models, OnStar has been developed from a navigation and emergency response system to embrace other multimedia functions, such as video and email. Significantly, GM is offering other carmakers the chance to fit OnStar, which suggests the firm will soon look to float off this business. Analysts at Deutsche Bank predicted last May that OnStar could generate revenues of $4bn by 2005. Meanwhile, rival Ford's Connect telematics system could be worth $3.2bn in five years. Earlier this year Ford unveiled prototype cars called 24-7s. These all have integrated telematic systems which, apart from turning vehicles into something like Kit, the camp-sounding onboard computer featured in the TV series Knight Rider, allow you to 'personalise' your car interior using a voice activation system. Want a pink dashboard? Just tell the car that's the mood you're in. The Economist Intelligence Unit says around 20 per cent of the value of an executive's car is based on its electronics systems. By 2005 this will reach 30 per cent. In addition, motor manufacturers know that by developing telematics systems they can can cut content deals with information providers and generate subscription revenues, so easing the cyclical nature of their industry. Ford already has a deal with AOL, while GM has Yahoo! on its side. But will the likes of Ford and GM be able dominate the telematics industry in the long run? McIntosh said: 'The debate will be about who controls the customers. It will be interesting to see whether it is the car manufacturers or the telecoms companies. It's difficult to see how that works out, because the two sectors' planning cycles are very different, and putting anything into a car takes up to five years.' So far the car industry as a whole has been extremely slow in cornering the market. Only 2 per cent of car phones are fitted by the manufacturer; the rest are fitted later. Big mobile phone firms are on the prowl. Vodafone, for instance, has a dedicated telematics arm, and is planning to launch its own vehicle tracking service. The mobile phone giant is talking to a number of carmakers about supplying onboard telematic systems as standard, although it declines to comment on specifics. But the danger is that drivers could soon have too much information. 'The industry needs to be focused,' McIntosh said. 'All this infotainment such as \"where's the nearest hotel, petrol station or golf course\" - where do you draw the line? Clearly, there is an issue of driver overload. There's only a certain amount of information that they can efficiently handle. Safety analysts are now starting to look at telematics.' Nevertheless, telematics is ripe for growth. The words 'information superhighway' have just taken on a whole new meaning.",

Loans to customers grew by 20 per cent in the six months to August, led by a spectacular performance from business banking; profit before tax grew by 14 per cent; and costs as a proportion of income - the standard measure of banking efficiency - fell to a record low of 46 per cent. </p> <p>Burt is confident it can continue to grow at this rate.

Schroder Salomon Smith Barney is, however, believed to have been appointed to find buyers for the latter and, assuming a respectable offer is forthcoming, Rank will soon be left with just the first two. </p> <p>At first glance, they look decent enough businesses. Operating profits at Mecca rose 35 per cent, while Hard Rock increased by 20 per cent in the first six months of this year. But gambling is hardly the kind of business to set the City alight - casinos are notoriously unpredictable, while bingo, despite Rank's success in attracting a younger clientele, is mature. </p> <p>Squeezing growth from Hard Rock will be equally difficult. Indeed, the first-half performance owed much to cost-cutting and new openings. Like-for-like sales were down by 3.3 per cent, although this was an improvement on the 9.2 per cent decline suffered last year . </p> <p> Smith has said little about what he intends to do with the money. A cynic would say that reflects lack of options. </p> <p>He says he intends investing in internet gambling, but that will not absorb much money. There may be a few casinos to buy but, unless it makes a decisive move overseas, there would be no need for major investment. </p> <p> Hard Rock is absorbing some cash, both for refurbishments and for initiatives such as Hard Rock hotels. But Hard Rock trades partly on its exclusivity - it would never aim to be as ubiquitous as Burger King - so it is not going to need massive investment either. </p> <p>The work involved in unravelling the consequences of previous spending sprees, including the disastrous acquisition of the Tom Cobb-leigh pub chain, should be enough to deter Smith from adding more businesses just for the sake of it. </p> <p>That leaves one option: give the money back to shareholders. Rank has permission to buy back 15 per cent of its shares, but that would absorb less than \u00a3200m. Smith should augment that with a special dividend to bring the total to at least \u00a3500m.

      "body": "<p>Ten years on from the collapse of his financial services empire British &amp; Commonwealth, John Gunn is on a roll once again. Last month Christows, the West country stockbroker he helped to build, was taken over for a cool \u00a340 million. And next year three more investments made by B&amp;C's former chief executive are set to come to market with a total price of up to half a billion. </p> <p>For the wheeler dealer who was at the helm of one of the City's biggest financial crashes, success - like the best of revenges - is sweet. Since B&amp;C went under with debts of \u00a31.5 billion in 1990, Gunn has been beavering away quietly and far more profitably. Now 58, he started out again as a 'one-man incubator' to growth companies, providing a mix of business experience and his own money, long before venture capitalists reached for the fruits of the hi-tech garden. </p> <p>Along the way, he spent eight years fighting the Department of Trade and Industry. And when his day in court finally came, he won spectacularly. Gunn was the classic City scalp presumed guilty until proven innocent. The trauma still leaves him spitting blood at the politicians, the bankers and the toffee-nosed, blue-blooded City establishment that froze him out. Among the few notable exceptions, Gunn singles out Nigel Rudd, founder of Williams Holdings, and Nick Brigstocke, now chair of CSFB's London broking arm, as faithful supporters. </p> <p>The real venom remains reserved for the watchdogs and Whitehall. 'I never want to work in a high-profile job or regulated firm again. Just look what they did to me,' Gunn says. 'Regulators, civil servants, they're all lying, cheating, scheming bastards.' </p> <p>For the Cheshire railwayman's son, the new start was as much about retaining sanity, while fighting the DTI, as regaining a fortune. In the past decade, he has made some 25 investments. By no means all have been money-spinners. But West 175, the TV production company whose board he first joined after defeating the DTI, has quintupled his money. And the most successful to date, Turbo Genset, a developer of cheap electricity generators, has reaped Gunn a 130-fold gain after making its debut on the Stock Exchange in July. </p> <p>Gunn is coy about his newly-made fortune. But he admits he would easily make the annual British rich list tables. 'This is what I really joined B&amp;C to do. There we set up the first development-capital trust after 3i,' Gunn says. 'They knew if I went to work with private companies, firms were getting a lot of business experience they couldn't usually afford.' </p> <p>In the mid-Eighties, Gunn already had the world at his feet. After studying German at Nottingham and Berlin universities, he started his career in the foreign-exchange department of Barclays Bank in Manchester, before joining a small money broker in the City of London. In 1978, backed by the wealthy Cayzer family, he and the management team bought the operation out. By then called Exco, it floated on the stock market and by 1985, after a string of acquisitions, it was worth \u00a3500m. But following boardroom rows Gunn walked out, only to be snapped up by the Cayzers' British and Commonwealth. </p> <p>Formed in 1955, B&amp;C had once been Britain's biggest shipping line, but it had since diversified into aviation, hotels and the City through fund manager Gartmore. Financial services, Gunn believed, was where the action was. A \u00a32bn string of deals followed, including Exco, estate agent Abaco and, just three days before the 1987 stock-market crash, a \u00a3430m buyout of the astute Cayzer family's stake. </p> <p>For Gunn the timing of those moves - before Black Monday, recession and the property slump - was hardly propitious. Nor were his dealings with Gary Klesch, a sharp US dealmaker who failed to come up with cash in a \u00a3500m carve-up of rival broker Mercantile House. </p> <p>But Gunn's misfortune too far was the \u00a3400m takeover of Atlantic Computers, a computer-leasing business, in 1988. Founded by the late John Foulston, owner of Brands Hatch, Atlantic was effectively a pyramid selling operation, whose apparent profits masked huge liabilities. B&amp;C wrote off \u00a3550m when the 'black hole' came to light, the banks panicked - needlessly, says Gunn - and put in the administrators. 'We only needed a bridging loan. It was containable. The estimate was \u00a345m. B&amp;C shouldn't have gone under.' </p> <p>Writs flew like confetti and the DTI moved in. In 1994, Gunn was fiercely criticised in the inspectors' report, which the DTI used to bring disqualification proceedings against the main players. The case was the most expensive ever, costing upwards of \u00a35m, when it finally came to court in 1998. Six out of nine B&amp;C and Atlantic directors were barred. But it was hardly the DTI's finest hour. </p> <p>'As regards Mr Gunn, I have found no culpability in his relevant conduct,' the judge found, overturning all the main criticisms of the inspectors' investigation. Last year, too, City advisers on the deal, led by Barclays, stumped up \u00a3150m to settle claims of negligence. </p> <p>'The DTI report was false. We took them apart. I didn't do anything wrong and wasn't prepared to say I did,' Gunn says. 'It was like a Star Chamber. It was rigged. It shouldn't happen, but it does. To be scapegoated in this manner was appalling.' </p> <p>Despite being judged innocent, the affair still lingers. This summer, City advisers to Turbo Genset insisted the inspectors' criticisms be included in its flotation prospectus - and that the judge's remarks be included, too. The result was two pages of adversarial small print, which will be repeated every time Gunn sits on the board of a firm going to market. </p> <p>Not that he'll fret. A Californian vineyard and a holiday home in Switzerland mean Gunn and his German wife now get away from it all whenever the fancy takes them. The family firm Scheidegg, indeed, takes its name from the last station on the Jungfrau mountain railway. 'I'm making up for all the holidays I never took before. It's repayment time certainly to my wife.' Scheidegg, too, is building a tidy nest egg for his three daughters: the eldest is 34 and he has 31-year old-twins. </p> <p>Over the next year, Gunn is counting on two more innovative engineers for his next success: Corac Group, a developer of high-speed compressors, and Mechadyne, a maker of fuel-efficient engine valves. DAT, a software engineer, and LBM, an internet email business, may follow them to market in short order. </p> <p>Deliberately, Gunn seeks to help firms exploit technology developed at universities. Turbo Genset, for example, came out of London's Imperial College. And ironically, for all his travails with the authorities, Gunn's is exactly the sort of expertise the Government is now trying to tap. 'Business and government go hand in hand,' he says.

This is the central recommendation of the long-awaited Competition Commission investigation into the firms' growing power. </p> <p>After a 16-month inquiry, the Commission's report was passed to Ministers in August and is to be published by Trade and Industry Secretary Stephen Byers within weeks. </p> <p>It finds that the big five damage smaller grocers and limit consumer choice by selling staple items at rock-bottom prices. 'We conclude that the practice of persistent below-cost selling when conducted by Asda, Morrison, Safeway, Sainsbury and Tesco - ie those parties with market power - operates against the public interest,' the Commission says. </p> <p>Tesco, Sainsbury and Safeway are accused, too, of acting against the public interest by charging extra at stores facing less local competition. All the big chains denied acting uncompetitively. </p> <p>Controversially, however, the report comes out against forcing supermarket groups to sell off stores in areas where they are deemed to be too powerful. It rules out other measures - such as publishing prices on the internet for shoppers to make comparisions - as unworkable. </p> <p>Instead, to limit growing monopoly power, it recom mends that the five should have to gain OFT consent for any new supermarket of more than 1,000 square metres within a 15-minute drive of one of their existing branches. </p> <p>'We think that a dedicated unit should be established to deal with such cases within the OFT,' the report says. </p> <p>Following complaints, especially from small farmers, the Commission urges an OFT-approved code of conduct to improve the chains' treatment of suppliers. The proposals are likely to hit growth and unnerve supermarket shares this week. Farmers will be angered, too, as the report dismisses claims of supermarket profiteering and a 'Rip-Off Britain'. </p> <p>DTI Ministers, however, remain concerned about local supermarket monopolies and may yet take further action, when the report is published. </p> <p>'There is a very wide range of prices around the country. The chains are getting away with what the market will bear,' one Whitehall source said. 'The view is: \"Why should someone in Derby pay \u00a32 for a kilo of washing powder when people elsewhere pay \u00a31.50?' \" </p> <p>Ministers are looking to the revamped OFT, under new director-general John Vickers, to act on the findings. 'Ministers have made it plain that they want consumer protection at the OFT to be strengthened because until now it has been very weak,' one source said. 'If the OFT does not have systems to monitor prices then it will have to get them quickly.' </p> <p>The Government is also concerned that certain chains are stifling competition by snapping up land on which rivals could build. Of 408 sites held in land banks, 190 are owned by Tesco, the market leader, the report finds. </p> <p>'One of the things Ministers are considering is requiring them to publish details of land holdings, so it is clear what they have and where,' one Whitehall source said.</p>",

Tesco, Sainsbury and Safeway are accused, too, of acting against the public interest by charging extra at stores facing less local competition. All the big chains denied acting uncompetitively. Controversially, however, the report comes out against forcing supermarket groups to sell off stores in areas where they are deemed to be too powerful. It rules out other measures - such as publishing prices on the internet for shoppers to make comparisions - as unworkable. Instead, to limit growing monopoly power, it recom mends that the five should have to gain OFT consent for any new supermarket of more than 1,000 square metres within a 15-minute drive of one of their existing branches. 'We think that a dedicated unit should be established to deal with such cases within the OFT,' the report says. Following complaints, especially from small farmers, the Commission urges an OFT-approved code of conduct to improve the chains' treatment of suppliers. The proposals are likely to hit growth and unnerve supermarket shares this week. Farmers will be angered, too, as the report dismisses claims of supermarket profiteering and a 'Rip-Off Britain'. DTI Ministers, however, remain concerned about local supermarket monopolies and may yet take further action, when the report is published. 'There is a very wide range of prices around the country. The chains are getting away with what the market will bear,' one Whitehall source said. 'The view is: \"Why should someone in Derby pay \u00a32 for a kilo of washing powder when people elsewhere pay \u00a31.50?' \" Ministers are looking to the revamped OFT, under new director-general John Vickers, to act on the findings. 'Ministers have made it plain that they want consumer protection at the OFT to be strengthened because until now it has been very weak,' one source said. 'If the OFT does not have systems to monitor prices then it will have to get them quickly.' The Government is also concerned that certain chains are stifling competition by snapping up land on which rivals could build. Of 408 sites held in land banks, 190 are owned by Tesco, the market leader, the report finds. 'One of the things Ministers are considering is requiring them to publish details of land holdings, so it is clear what they have and where,' one Whitehall source said.",

Thanks to Blair, conference is not policy making. The Government downplayed the vote. This was why Blair emasculated the unions in the first place.

Why had Blair, Gordon Brown and John Prescott dragged Bickerstaffe, Edmonds and Bill Morris of the T&amp;G in and out of meetings on Wednesday morning? </p> <p>Perhaps the answer goes back to Blair's Tuesday night back-patting. Obviously the Government does not want to be beaten about in public by the unions - and Brown will have to exercise all his political skill in delivering a pensions package in his pre-Budget report at the end of this month. But Blair seems to accept - now he no longer commands the polls - that a closer relationship between government and the unions is at least expedient, if not wholly to his liking. </p> <p>The embarrassment is in the timing - just as Blair admits their importance, and is conciliatory in public, the unions deliver an old-fashioned knee in the gut. Both sides will be hoping that Wednesday was the exception that proves a new rule. </p> <p>Unions believe they ought to be, and are being, taken seriously, having shown restraint as Labour's modernisers distanced them from the party.

'Bill and I are working closely together on that with them now, and they're grateful.' </p> <p>It is not just fuel.

Union restraint in public means the Government is able to tap it without entering a politically damaging Faustian deal along the lines of the 'social contract' engineered in the Seventies by another resonant name - Jack Jones. The effect within Government, according to Whitehall insiders, is that the stock of 'old Labour' Ministers with close union contacts is at a premium - Blair paid direct tribute to Prescott in his speech for this reason. </p> <p>One ministerial adviser said last week: 'There has been a lot more fixing this year.

I'm also keen on direct debits. 'Holidays are my biggest expense, and meals out. If I stopped going out I could get a mortgage. I love entertaining. Beaky (Evetts - another reporter on Watchdog ) has very expensive tastes in clothes; I prefer Mark One and New Look. It's odd really, I can spend \u00a360 on a meal out but I'd think quite carefully before spending that much on clothes.'",

      "body": "<p>As a child Robert Opie collected things. The usual stuff: stamps, coins, matchbox cars. But at 16 his acquisitive attention turned to something a bit different - contemporary packaging. </p> <p>'It seemed both weird and sane,' says Opie. 'I had absolutely no money and there I was in 1968 spend ing one-and-sixpence on various tubes of toothpaste that I was never going to use.' </p> <p>To-day his collection stretches back to Victorian times; it is featured in books, exhibitions and is the basis for two museums. It's fair to say his modest, if strange, investments have paid off. </p> <p>But is this the case for most collecting fanatics? Can their particular and pec-uliar hoards really gain in value, or would they fail to attract interest even at a village bring-and-buy? 'If there is a genuine collectors' market out there, with an international audience, they can make a profit,' says Tim Wonnacott, chairman of Sotheby's South. </p> <p>Gwyn Jones, managing editor of Collect it! magazine, agrees, pointing out that one man's trash can indeed be another's treasure. 'People collect everything and it is possible to make money on it all - carrier bags, sick bags, bottle tops, washing machines, coat hangers, barbed wire, bricks.' </p> <p>Even bits of medieval royals can attract a high price these days. Bonham's sold a snip of Edward IV's beard for \u00a3500 this year, and a lock of Charles I's hair went for more than \u00a34,000. </p> <p>But like most investments there are simple rules to keep in mind. And it helps if you are lucky, too. </p> <p>Greg Vandike is a case in point. He grew up surrounded by music. His parents were in the business and, as a boy, he saw the Rolling Stones and the Beatles; he got to meet the likes of David Bowie and Pink Floyd. 'Sometimes they'd give me things or just sign things and I'd keep it all,' says Vandike, who went on to become a band promoter, organising gigs for artists such as the Sex Pistols. </p> <p>He kept any left-over sou venirs. 'Spare posters, programmes, tickets, you name it.' Storage was always a problem; the garage was regularly cleared out. 'I must have burned at least three-quarters of everything.' </p> <p>What remained, Vandike later realised, was a 'little goldmine'. One album alone could now fetch \u00a35,000. In addition to being an avid collector, Vandike is now an ob-sessive dealer - he claims to be one of the world's most respected dealers in rare records from the Fifties, Sixties and Seventies. 'Not bad for someone who just happened to be in the right place at the right time,' he says. </p> <p>But an ad hoc approach does not always pay dividends. Sometimes what is required is good old fashioned meticulousness. Enter Ronnie Roter. Twenty-five years ago he decided to become an expert in his chosen subject - Gone With The Wind . 'I am now the UK's foremost authority on the film. I am by far the leading collector outside America.' </p> <p>Roter owns thousands of pieces, from signed books to bound manuscripts estimated to be worth $20,000 each. Then there is a letter written by Clark Gable that Roter bought from an elderly American. 'It's probably worth \u00a35,000 to \u00a310,000,' he says. 'Prices really have shot up astronomically; what I own is worth a lot of money - at least \u00a3200,000.' </p> <p>Yet not all collections, no matter how comprehensive or obscure, gain in value. Alexander Crum Ewing, director of collections at Bonhams, explains further. 'We once had a lady ring us up with 2,000 Smurfs. The most they would fetch is \u00a31 each, but moving them as a lot would be very difficult. We said the best she could do was buy herself a woolly scarf, block out several Sundays and set herself up at a car boot sale.' </p> <p>So what makes a good in-vestment and what makes a dud? Hugh Scully, presenter of the Antiques Road Show and valuer for online auctioneer QXL.com, provides a simple answer. 'Value is governed by quality, rarity, fashion and nostalgia.' </p> <p>Here's how to get the mix right. First, do your research. 'Know what you should be buying and what you should be paying,' says Jones of Collect it! Next, make sure the area you are collecting has potential - either it is a steady bet, a good outsider or a complete long shot where you try to predict what will be the next big thing. The latter, says Jones, is a real risk, 'but that's the fun of the gamble'. </p> <p>When you do start to buy, go for what you like. 'Choose what excites you, what in-spires you, what tempts you,' says Wonnacott of Sotheby's. </p> <p>And always get the best quality you can afford in the best condition you can find. 'You're much better off with one perfect, decent piece than five tired, mediocre pieces,' says Crum Ewing. </p> <p>Once your collection starts to build, get it properly valued and fully insured. 'Do this sooner rather than later,' advises David Hoyles, insurance manager for Age Concern Enterprises. </p> <p>If you do put a piece on the market, check out where it will sell best - with a dealer, at an auction, or on the internet. Seek advice from the relevant collector group. </p> <p>Also bear in mind any financial implications of the sale. If you make more than \u00a37,200, you'll face capital gains tax. If you trade a lot, the Inland Revenue may deem you to be earning an income and tax you accordingly. 'This is very open to interpretation,' says Jon Briggs, associate director of Chart-well Asset Management. 'Timing is important.' </p> <p>More and more people are getting into collecting. The market is worth \u00a3650 million a year according to Business Intelligence Service, which says the average spend has increased 11 per cent. This begs the question of what that money is being spent on, and which markets will be hot in the future. </p> <p>'If I knew the answer to that, I would now be on a very large yacht in the south of France sipping a nice cool Sancerre,' says Scully. 'But I can give a few hints. Look out for things that are of today, that reflect the end of the twentieth century and the dawn of a new millennium.' </p> <p>But even if a collector does get it right, they are usually loth to sell their treasures anyway, regardless of how much they can make. 'Collectors are passionate people and I know of no case where someone has willingly parted with a collection,' says Scully. 'To many it would be worse than divorce.' </p> <p>Wonnacott agrees. 'It's never about the financial gain; it's always about the pleasure involved. It is something deeply ingrained in us. Maybe it goes back to our hunter-gatherer instinct. We feel a compulsion to go out and find things that bring us joy and happiness and comfort. Things that we can bring back into our inner space - our haven. </p> <p>'And once they are in place, there is no way you will want to part with them, whether they are worth 50p or much more.'</p>",

But at 16 his acquisitive attention turned to something a bit different - contemporary packaging. 'It seemed both weird and sane,' says Opie. 'I had absolutely no money and there I was in 1968 spend ing one-and-sixpence on various tubes of toothpaste that I was never going to use.' To-day his collection stretches back to Victorian times; it is featured in books, exhibitions and is the basis for two museums. It's fair to say his modest, if strange, investments have paid off. But is this the case for most collecting fanatics? Can their particular and pec-uliar hoards really gain in value, or would they fail to attract interest even at a village bring-and-buy? 'If there is a genuine collectors' market out there, with an international audience, they can make a profit,' says Tim Wonnacott, chairman of Sotheby's South. Gwyn Jones, managing editor of Collect it! magazine, agrees, pointing out that one man's trash can indeed be another's treasure. 'People collect everything and it is possible to make money on it all - carrier bags, sick bags, bottle tops, washing machines, coat hangers, barbed wire, bricks.' Even bits of medieval royals can attract a high price these days. Bonham's sold a snip of Edward IV's beard for \u00a3500 this year, and a lock of Charles I's hair went for more than \u00a34,000. But like most investments there are simple rules to keep in mind. And it helps if you are lucky, too. Greg Vandike is a case in point. He grew up surrounded by music. His parents were in the business and, as a boy, he saw the Rolling Stones and the Beatles; he got to meet the likes of David Bowie and Pink Floyd. 'Sometimes they'd give me things or just sign things and I'd keep it all,' says Vandike, who went on to become a band promoter, organising gigs for artists such as the Sex Pistols. He kept any left-over sou venirs. 'Spare posters, programmes, tickets, you name it.' Storage was always a problem; the garage was regularly cleared out. 'I must have burned at least three-quarters of everything.' What remained, Vandike later realised, was a 'little goldmine'. One album alone could now fetch \u00a35,000. In addition to being an avid collector, Vandike is now an ob-sessive dealer - he claims to be one of the world's most respected dealers in rare records from the Fifties, Sixties and Seventies. 'Not bad for someone who just happened to be in the right place at the right time,' he says. But an ad hoc approach does not always pay dividends. Sometimes what is required is good old fashioned meticulousness. Enter Ronnie Roter. Twenty-five years ago he decided to become an expert in his chosen subject - Gone With The Wind . 'I am now the UK's foremost authority on the film. I am by far the leading collector outside America.' Roter owns thousands of pieces, from signed books to bound manuscripts estimated to be worth $20,000 each. Then there is a letter written by Clark Gable that Roter bought from an elderly American. 'It's probably worth \u00a35,000 to \u00a310,000,' he says. 'Prices really have shot up astronomically; what I own is worth a lot of money - at least \u00a3200,000.' Yet not all collections, no matter how comprehensive or obscure, gain in value. Alexander Crum Ewing, director of collections at Bonhams, explains further. 'We once had a lady ring us up with 2,000 Smurfs. The most they would fetch is \u00a31 each, but moving them as a lot would be very difficult. We said the best she could do was buy herself a woolly scarf, block out several Sundays and set herself up at a car boot sale.' So what makes a good in-vestment and what makes a dud? Hugh Scully, presenter of the Antiques Road Show and valuer for online auctioneer QXL.com, provides a simple answer. 'Value is governed by quality, rarity, fashion and nostalgia.' Here's how to get the mix right. First, do your research. 'Know what you should be buying and what you should be paying,' says Jones of Collect it! Next, make sure the area you are collecting has potential - either it is a steady bet, a good outsider or a complete long shot where you try to predict what will be the next big thing. The latter, says Jones, is a real risk, 'but that's the fun of the gamble'. When you do start to buy, go for what you like. 'Choose what excites you, what in-spires you, what tempts you,' says Wonnacott of Sotheby's. And always get the best quality you can afford in the best condition you can find. 'You're much better off with one perfect, decent piece than five tired, mediocre pieces,' says Crum Ewing. Once your collection starts to build, get it properly valued and fully insured. 'Do this sooner rather than later,' advises David Hoyles, insurance manager for Age Concern Enterprises. If you do put a piece on the market, check out where it will sell best - with a dealer, at an auction, or on the internet. Seek advice from the relevant collector group. Also bear in mind any financial implications of the sale. If you make more than \u00a37,200, you'll face capital gains tax. If you trade a lot, the Inland Revenue may deem you to be earning an income and tax you accordingly. 'This is very open to interpretation,' says Jon Briggs, associate director of Chart-well Asset Management. 'Timing is important.' More and more people are getting into collecting. The market is worth \u00a3650 million a year according to Business Intelligence Service, which says the average spend has increased 11 per cent. This begs the question of what that money is being spent on, and which markets will be hot in the future. 'If I knew the answer to that, I would now be on a very large yacht in the south of France sipping a nice cool Sancerre,' says Scully. 'But I can give a few hints. Look out for things that are of today, that reflect the end of the twentieth century and the dawn of a new millennium.' But even if a collector does get it right, they are usually loth to sell their treasures anyway, regardless of how much they can make. 'Collectors are passionate people and I know of no case where someone has willingly parted with a collection,' says Scully. 'To many it would be worse than divorce.' Wonnacott agrees. 'It's never about the financial gain; it's always about the pleasure involved. It is something deeply ingrained in us. Maybe it goes back to our hunter-gatherer instinct. We feel a compulsion to go out and find things that bring us joy and happiness and comfort. Things that we can bring back into our inner space - our haven. 'And once they are in place, there is no way you will want to part with them, whether they are worth 50p or much more.'",

It is possible, for instance, that a case for a more generous Legal Aid system could be made under the 'right to an effective remedy' which states that 'everyone... shall have an effective remedy before a national authority...' An imaginative judge might say that the current remedies are ineffective since people cannot afford to go to law. A more traditional approach would be to say that the remedy is available, and it is up to individuals how they sort out paying for such a remedy. </p> <p>Some bodies have been long prepared for tomorrow's changes. The Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS), for instance, is preparing for a slight increase in the number of people asking for a hearing in front of a tribunal, under the rights now outlined to fair trials. </p> <p>At the moment, the different ombudsmen who work in the FOS office try to keep such hearings to a mini mum, so that cases can be dealt with quickly, easily and fairly informally. </p> <p>The senior ombudsman, Walter Merricks, says: 'We're not going to go overboard on it - but from 2 October people will be entitled to ask for a hearing.' </p> <p>In theory, the Act applies only to public bodies - so, for instance, that a worker in the private sector would have less chance of asserting their right to privacy against an employer than a local government officer, a teacher in a state school or a soldier. </p> <p>This issue could well come to a head if employees are sacked when bosses monitor their emails and find something they do not like. Linda Parry, of solicitor Keoghs in Bolton, believes that the law could be made to stretch to the private sector if employment tribunals (themselves public bodies) feel they have to apply the Human Rights Act to all people who appear before them. </p> <p>It is difficult to imagine that tribunal chairs would wish to develop different rulings for private and public sector workers. The bigger problem, in practice, could be the issue of remedies that tribunals could give out. </p> <p>'There is no automatic right to compensation,' says Parry. While a tribunal could give an award for damages, if it thought someone had been unfairly dismissed, it may be inclined to seek a non-financial solution, such as reinstatement of the employee. </p> <p>The crucial issue is how judges interpret the law. It may be that it takes another 10 years before a more modern set of men and women occupy the judges' seats.</p> <p><strong>The case for 'civil partnerships' </strong></p> <p>The part of last month's Liberal Democratic Party conference which most annoyed the Daily Telegraph was the proposal for 'civil partnerships'. Some commentators have started calling it a plan for 'gay marriage' - but that is not an accurate description. </p> <p>Under the Lib Dem plan - put forward to coincide with the Human Rights Act - both heterosexual and gay couples could ask to have their partnership registered in a half-way house between cohabitation and marriage.</p> <p>'Although the Liberal Democrats have not said it as such, I would expect that the new rights would be a bit less than you would get in marriage,' says family law expert Mark Harper of law firm Withers. 'Maybe the rules on maintenance would be different. It may be that the new law would say that the people cohabiting would be expected to be self-supporting if they split up.' After marriage, however, a dependent spouse can apply for maintenance from the other partner.</p> <p>The Lib Dem proposals do say that the civil partnership would cover prop erty, inheritance and pensions issues (as well as maintenance - although, as Harper says, this could be watered down if there are no children involved).</p> <p>While the Law Society, the solicitors' body, has called for a wide-ranging cohabitation law which would cover people living together, the Lib Dem plan would require people to opt into it. Hilary Siddle of law firm Holden &amp; Wilsons in Lancaster has been heavily involved in the Law Society campaign. 'Reform of the law could stop a lot of litigation over things written on the back of a fag packet,' she says. The offices of family lawyers are full of impoverished ex-partners who realise too late that the law gives them little help if they want a share of their ex-partner's wealth. A wife could win the marital home in a settlement, while a cohabitee may end up with nothing.</p> <p>But when the Law Society published its cohabitation proposals last year, it felt politicians would not welcome such a controversial change. Siddle says: 'When the Government has decided that it won't introduce no-fault divorce, it certainly won't take on board changes that take non-marital relationships under the state umbrella.'</p>",

The senior ombudsman, Walter Merricks, says: 'We're not going to go overboard on it - but from 2 October people will be entitled to ask for a hearing.' In theory, the Act applies only to public bodies - so, for instance, that a worker in the private sector would have less chance of asserting their right to privacy against an employer than a local government officer, a teacher in a state school or a soldier. This issue could well come to a head if employees are sacked when bosses monitor their emails and find something they do not like. Linda Parry, of solicitor Keoghs in Bolton, believes that the law could be made to stretch to the private sector if employment tribunals (themselves public bodies) feel they have to apply the Human Rights Act to all people who appear before them. It is difficult to imagine that tribunal chairs would wish to develop different rulings for private and public sector workers. The bigger problem, in practice, could be the issue of remedies that tribunals could give out. 'There is no automatic right to compensation,' says Parry. While a tribunal could give an award for damages, if it thought someone had been unfairly dismissed, it may be inclined to seek a non-financial solution, such as reinstatement of the employee. The crucial issue is how judges interpret the law. It may be that it takes another 10 years before a more modern set of men and women occupy the judges' seats. The case for 'civil partnerships' The part of last month's Liberal Democratic Party conference which most annoyed the Daily Telegraph was the proposal for 'civil partnerships'. Some commentators have started calling it a plan for 'gay marriage' - but that is not an accurate description. Under the Lib Dem plan - put forward to coincide with the Human Rights Act - both heterosexual and gay couples could ask to have their partnership registered in a half-way house between cohabitation and marriage. 'Although the Liberal Democrats have not said it as such, I would expect that the new rights would be a bit less than you would get in marriage,' says family law expert Mark Harper of law firm Withers. 'Maybe the rules on maintenance would be different. It may be that the new law would say that the people cohabiting would be expected to be self-supporting if they split up.' After marriage, however, a dependent spouse can apply for maintenance from the other partner. The Lib Dem proposals do say that the civil partnership would cover prop erty, inheritance and pensions issues (as well as maintenance - although, as Harper says, this could be watered down if there are no children involved). While the Law Society, the solicitors' body, has called for a wide-ranging cohabitation law which would cover people living together, the Lib Dem plan would require people to opt into it. Hilary Siddle of law firm Holden &amp; Wilsons in Lancaster has been heavily involved in the Law Society campaign. 'Reform of the law could stop a lot of litigation over things written on the back of a fag packet,' she says. The offices of family lawyers are full of impoverished ex-partners who realise too late that the law gives them little help if they want a share of their ex-partner's wealth. A wife could win the marital home in a settlement, while a cohabitee may end up with nothing. But when the Law Society published its cohabitation proposals last year, it felt politicians would not welcome such a controversial change. Siddle says: 'When the Government has decided that it won't introduce no-fault divorce, it certainly won't take on board changes that take non-marital relationships under the state umbrella.'",

It decided to go for a much cheaper option, funding the nursing care element, which it announced in July this year.

Under the plans, someone with Alzheimer's would get very little financial assistance. Helping someone get dressed is defined as personal care, as is helping them eat their food or go to the toilet. Nursing care is something done by a registered nurse. As the law stands, there need be only one nurse on duty in a nursing home at any one time. Nursing care will largely be restricted to medical duties such as dispensing drugs. </p> <p>The charities are also angry that the Government has done little to encourage healthy living and prevent dependency. 'We are profoundly disappointed with the proposed Government solution,' says Mervyn Kohler of Help the Aged.

Hardly a glamorous subject, the study of falls has huge implications for both individual and state. </p> <p>One in three women over 65 and one in five men have a fall each year. About 20 per cent of these falls lead to injury or fracture. The majority of admissions into hospital in this age group, and 40 per cent of nursing home admissions, are due to falls. Fractures, which are mainly due to falls, cost the National Health Service \u00a3940 million each year. </p> <p>Research into Ageing is now working on a short physical education programme which appears to cut the chances of falling by 50 per cent by, for instance, strengthening ankles, the lower leg and the physical confidence of pensioners. National programmes of this sort would have a negligible cost to the state. To the individual it might mean a weekly visit to a gentle aerobics class.

Standard Life calculates that a 45-year- old who started a personal pension five years ago and is paying \u00a3150 a month into a fund now worth \u00a310,000 will have \u00a34,600 more in his fund when he reaches 60 - assuming investment growth at 7 per cent - than under the old fee structure. </p> <p>The move on endowments comes just days before the regulatory authorities announce plans for cleaning up the endowment scandal.

      "body": "<p>Andy, a film director of 35, is known as the 'King of Bartering' by his friends. His first experience of haggling with shopkeepers was when he was 15 and desperate for a punk shirt from Kensington Market. 'I kept making this poor bloke go up and down a ladder to fetch a different shirt. When I turned up the next day, he gave in and sold it to me for the money I had. </p> <p>'I never used to pay the full price,' he says. 'Especially on electrical goods, TVs and stereos. You soon find that you don't have to if you are cheeky or humorous en-ough to get away with it. </p> <p>'As a student, I used to go to Tottenham Court Road, from one electrical shop to another, asking the salesman to write down his lowest price on a business card. I would then go next door, show them the card and ask if they could give me a lower price. I would carry on to the next shop and the one after that, asking the same thing. Eventually, I would be given the very lowest price possible, but only if I paid then and there - because they soon caught on.' </p> <p>According to Andy, on certain items worth around \u00a3600 to \u00a3700, it is possible to bring down the price by up to \u00a3200. 'I remember helping a friend to buy a video recorder and she came away with \u00a380 off the marked price and about six videos thrown in. </p> <p>'If you think about it, it's no different to how people behave professionally. A film producer, for example, will have a budget and will haggle with the caterers or with the people who supply equipment to bring down their price. It's a question of trying to pay what you consider to be reasonable and paying what you can rather than what you are told.'</p> <p><strong>Bargains in store - if you've nerve </strong></p> <p>Comet set the cat among the pigeons a year ago when it launched 'The Comet Price: Always low prices guaranteed'. This was accompanied by a warning that the chain was no longer prepared to haggle. Come again? This made consumers feel that they'd been missing a trick - and for how long? </p> <p>Their Hotpoints and Whirlpools suddenly lost their sparkle - could they have got them for even less? According to a recent Mintel report on white goods sales, 54 per cent of the people interviewed claimed to bargain on price, with empty nesters being the most vocal. A John Lewis salesperson confided that customers attempted to haggle on price 'all the time' and would go back and forth between retailers claiming that so- and-so was offering it for less and could they match the price? This, the saleperson claimed, often included requests for John Lewis to go below even the famous 'never knowingly under- sold' price promise.</p> <p>While research- ing this article, I tried my luck in retailers such as Dixons, a Sony Centre and Currys and nobody flinched when I suggested buying three or more items in the hope of securing a discount.</p> <p>In Sketchley I was told that it's always worth asking for a discount if you're having a few things cleaned at the same time. In Habitat, as at Home- base, John Lewis and Comet, any ex-display items suddenly take on the mantle of products in a car boot sale and the rules are instantly rewritten. And, of course, independent retailers can often operate with the flexibility of a market trader.</p> <p>'Leeway' and 'margins' are key words that most shoppers probably don't mutter under their breath as they mosey along the high street. They would do well to give them a thought. Most retailers, sales assistants and, in particular, store managers, do have a certain amount of leeway - as the extremely forthcoming man in Comet was eager to inform me. And, when it comes to margins, as long as the retailer is making a profit, they are prepared to move a little if it's a case of making, rather than losing, a sale. If sales are down one week - although the average consumer has no idea of whether this is the case - it is likely to mean that the following week, should you try to drive even the softest of bargains, the retailer is likely to say yes.</p> <p>It's worth asking: they can only say no. Suggesting that they 'throw something in' can be a winner. Since I told people what I was writing about, anecdotes have abounded: videos bundled in with TVs; free duvets with beds; toasters with ovens - you just need the nerve to ask.</p> <p><strong>The thrill of the chase...</strong></p> <p>Anne Sampson, pictured, has just launched an internet business called <a href=\"http://www.farmconnection.co.uk\">Farm Connection</a>, which sells luxury food direct from specialist producers. She is a professional haggler and has haggled for everything from a hotel room to the price of a LearnDirect course, part-funded by Business Link. </p> <p>'A lot of it is confidence,' she says. 'Once you've done it a few times, you get used to it. I wasn't brought up to haggle: my parents thought it was rude to question the price of something.</p> <p>'I think it boils down to knowing what you want; knowing what you're prepared to pay for something, recognising what value it has to you, and then understanding that there is a middle ground on which to negotiate.</p> <p>'Research is important. When I bought my house I needed a washing machine, a fridge and a vacuum cleaner. I did my research. I'm not so sad that I do a spreadsheet, although I do make notes, using newspapers, websites and going into shops.</p> <p>'In the end I went to Currys, thinking \"This is the arena in which to play\". There was a young chap in there and I told him what I wanted to buy. He added the prices up and I asked \"What discount can you offer me for buying all three here?\" They were actually quite good prices, but I just thought I'd be cheeky. He checked with his manager and offered me 6-7 per cent off. I said: \"Couldn't you round it down?\" He winced and went back to his manager and they came back with \"Staff only get 10 per cent\".</p> <p>I was quite nonchalant and I was almost acting it out. I was always prepared to walk away. But I left feeling quite triumphant, as I got 10 per cent discount, free delivery, interest-free credit and they even installed the washing machine.

      "bodyText": "Andy, a film director of 35, is known as the 'King of Bartering' by his friends. His first experience of haggling with shopkeepers was when he was 15 and desperate for a punk shirt from Kensington Market. 'I kept making this poor bloke go up and down a ladder to fetch a different shirt. When I turned up the next day, he gave in and sold it to me for the money I had. 'I never used to pay the full price,' he says. 'Especially on electrical goods, TVs and stereos. You soon find that you don't have to if you are cheeky or humorous en-ough to get away with it. 'As a student, I used to go to Tottenham Court Road, from one electrical shop to another, asking the salesman to write down his lowest price on a business card. I would then go next door, show them the card and ask if they could give me a lower price. I would carry on to the next shop and the one after that, asking the same thing. Eventually, I would be given the very lowest price possible, but only if I paid then and there - because they soon caught on.' According to Andy, on certain items worth around \u00a3600 to \u00a3700, it is possible to bring down the price by up to \u00a3200. 'I remember helping a friend to buy a video recorder and she came away with \u00a380 off the marked price and about six videos thrown in. 'If you think about it, it's no different to how people behave professionally. A film producer, for example, will have a budget and will haggle with the caterers or with the people who supply equipment to bring down their price. It's a question of trying to pay what you consider to be reasonable and paying what you can rather than what you are told.' Bargains in store - if you've nerve Comet set the cat among the pigeons a year ago when it launched 'The Comet Price: Always low prices guaranteed'. This was accompanied by a warning that the chain was no longer prepared to haggle. Come again? This made consumers feel that they'd been missing a trick - and for how long? Their Hotpoints and Whirlpools suddenly lost their sparkle - could they have got them for even less? According to a recent Mintel report on white goods sales, 54 per cent of the people interviewed claimed to bargain on price, with empty nesters being the most vocal. A John Lewis salesperson confided that customers attempted to haggle on price 'all the time' and would go back and forth between retailers claiming that so- and-so was offering it for less and could they match the price? This, the saleperson claimed, often included requests for John Lewis to go below even the famous 'never knowingly under- sold' price promise. While research- ing this article, I tried my luck in retailers such as Dixons, a Sony Centre and Currys and nobody flinched when I suggested buying three or more items in the hope of securing a discount. In Sketchley I was told that it's always worth asking for a discount if you're having a few things cleaned at the same time. In Habitat, as at Home- base, John Lewis and Comet, any ex-display items suddenly take on the mantle of products in a car boot sale and the rules are instantly rewritten. And, of course, independent retailers can often operate with the flexibility of a market trader. 'Leeway' and 'margins' are key words that most shoppers probably don't mutter under their breath as they mosey along the high street. They would do well to give them a thought. Most retailers, sales assistants and, in particular, store managers, do have a certain amount of leeway - as the extremely forthcoming man in Comet was eager to inform me. And, when it comes to margins, as long as the retailer is making a profit, they are prepared to move a little if it's a case of making, rather than losing, a sale. If sales are down one week - although the average consumer has no idea of whether this is the case - it is likely to mean that the following week, should you try to drive even the softest of bargains, the retailer is likely to say yes. It's worth asking: they can only say no. Suggesting that they 'throw something in' can be a winner. Since I told people what I was writing about, anecdotes have abounded: videos bundled in with TVs; free duvets with beds; toasters with ovens - you just need the nerve to ask. The thrill of the chase... Anne Sampson, pictured, has just launched an internet business called Farm Connection, which sells luxury food direct from specialist producers. She is a professional haggler and has haggled for everything from a hotel room to the price of a LearnDirect course, part-funded by Business Link. 'A lot of it is confidence,' she says. 'Once you've done it a few times, you get used to it. I wasn't brought up to haggle: my parents thought it was rude to question the price of something. 'I think it boils down to knowing what you want; knowing what you're prepared to pay for something, recognising what value it has to you, and then understanding that there is a middle ground on which to negotiate. 'Research is important. When I bought my house I needed a washing machine, a fridge and a vacuum cleaner. I did my research. I'm not so sad that I do a spreadsheet, although I do make notes, using newspapers, websites and going into shops. 'In the end I went to Currys, thinking \"This is the arena in which to play\". There was a young chap in there and I told him what I wanted to buy. He added the prices up and I asked \"What discount can you offer me for buying all three here?\" They were actually quite good prices, but I just thought I'd be cheeky. He checked with his manager and offered me 6-7 per cent off. I said: \"Couldn't you round it down?\" He winced and went back to his manager and they came back with \"Staff only get 10 per cent\". I was quite nonchalant and I was almost acting it out. I was always prepared to walk away. But I left feeling quite triumphant, as I got 10 per cent discount, free delivery, interest-free credit and they even installed the washing machine. The discount paid for the vacuum cleaner and I took it away there and then, thinking \"I've got it in the boot of my car and I got it free because I haggled for it\". 'I suppose my advice is not to be afraid to try it. My husband is even more of a haggler than I am. He can quite happily say \"What's today's discount?\" or even \"What's the Sunny Saturday Discount?\". My granny was really into jumble sales but she didn't call them that because \"jumble\" sounds rubbishy. She used to say: \"I'm going sale-ing' or 'I'm going to a rummage\". The negotiating gave her a real buzz. 'After a successful haggle, I get the feeling that I've saved a bit of money so I can go and buy something extravagant.' How to get the best price \u0095 Do your research \u0095 Shop around \u0095 Ask yourself what you are prepared to pay for something \u0095 Be confident \u0095 Act knowledgeably \u0095 Be lighthearted and pleasant \u0095 Don't come across as over-keen \u0095 Be prepared to walk away: you can always come back later \u0095 Act as if you do it all the time - if your voice starts to wobble, you'll lose credibility \u0095 Don't punch air in the shop - it's uncool (and it's just as uncool to do it in the car park)",

Birtwistle wrote it for the reopening of Severance Hall in Cleveland, and it lasts about two minutes. Short, then, but not little.

The thick textures briefly split to reveal glimpses of Debussyan clear sky, immediately obliterated by a crunching blast of raw power. In the music's dying echoes, the trumpet sounds a faltering last post. Saturated with atmosphere, the piece sets the scene: but for what? Perhaps Birtwistle's new opera, The Last Supper, which opens at Glyndebourne later this month. </p> <p>After Birtwistle's brevity, Bart\u00f3k's Concerto for Orchestra seemed discursive, if hardly long-winded. The little dance of the second movement was sardonic and sour, while the 'interrupted intermezzo' of the fourth movement had a desperate tipsiness that was most moving. To follow, Pamela Frank gave a big-boned performance of Dvor\u00e1k's Violin Concerto. Some of her phrasing was a shade sketchy, but she revelled in the virtuosity that the piece requires. </p> <p>It was in Jan\u00e1c ek's Sinfonietta that orchestra and conductor really let loose. Mackerras, of course, has been the composer's champion for half a century, but experience has not routinised his performances. There are passages in the Sinfonietta which have a rhythmic and sonic exuberance bordering on craziness, and the whole orchestra played with the energy of the possessed. This was the BBCSO's first concert at the Barbican since adopting the hall as its new 'home', and it made a hell of a house-warming. </p> <p>I don't think <b> Colin Davis</b> matched that the following day, but he came close. If Jan\u00e1c ek is Mackerras's first love, then Berlioz is Davis's, and here he continued his year-long Berlioz Odyssey with the London Symphony Orchestra. Yuri Bashmet, the viola soloist in Berlioz's Harold in Italy, played the opening movement with the brakes on, impeding the forward momentum. At times he coarsened his tone to exaggerated effect, yet elsewhere he found the requisite subtlety, investing the slenderest thread of sound with an aching poignancy. </p> <p>The Symphonie Fantastique followed, a performance hindered by squawks from the PA system outside the auditorium, so intrusive that Davis had to break off the third movement and begin again. Fortunately the LSO soon re-established the mood, the strings in particular playing with astonishing refinement. That third movement, with its imitation of a rustic wind-band, can seem arch, but the 'March to the Scaffold' was riotous, while the 'Dream of the Witches' Sabbath' had, like Mackerras's Jan\u00e1c ek, a touch of madness.

An MC corrals the DJs together, and starts to read through the list of names -D'Souza's is worryingly absent. He wanders back to his seat, and I offer my sympathies. There's always next year, I mutter. D'Souza, jetlagged from his flight, obviously reeling from his emotional bombshell, and probably crippled financially by the journey, smiles sheepishly. He looks on the verge of tears. For the rest of the night he will sorrowfully stalk the venue, clutching at a pink cuddly toy for comfort. </p> <p>The other failures look equally despondent. 'It was the turntable,' complains DJ Venom, from Croatia. 'The needle jumped.' 'The record jumped,' moans Tunisia's DJ Mourad. 'The needle was everywhere,' blasts Ireland's JP.

No one would expect a play about a tank crew - which includes an Irishman, a West Indian, a Sikh and a Scot - on the eve of battle to do other than give them a good character and send them off to die.

There's a wonderfully agile episode in which the men, preparing for their last assault, mime and chant their actions in the tank: in doing so they become closer, and like a piece of machinery.

The subterfuge proves inflammatory: pert in pantaloons, she is enthusiastically snogged by a passing wit. </p> <p>These gender-bending kisses are one of many moments which wire The Country Wife into the present. Its tale - of an imprisoning marriage and a string of guilt-free adulteries - suggests that injunctions to meekness and chastity were simply a huge cul-de-sac in the history of women's lives. Suzanne Burden is a voracious, beady Lady Fidget, Hermione Gulliford a delicately perturbed Alithea. As the ing\u00e9nue who develops a flair for scheming, Hamilton produces a squeaky-doll version of herself: romping, tousled, dealing her aged husband fierce, sexy little punches, and making herself more delectable all the while. </p> <p>Each quip is crisply delivered, rather than lingered over. In Oram's lovely design - an aquamarine space striped with pale light - as one door closes, another opens. Little gusts of music puff the action along. Seamlessness and speed are the hallmarks of Grandage's direction. </p> <p>If you think of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musicals as a flu to which the West End regularly succumbs, you'd have to say that <strong> The Beautiful Game</strong> is not the most virulent strain. This treatment of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, which focuses on the fortunes of a young football team, kicking off in Belfast in 1969, tries to break the mould. </p> <p>Threading his music through with the warble and wail of pipes, Lloyd Webber has produced an instantly catchy, soupy ballad 'Our Kind of Love'. Refreshingly, the cast sing in Belfast accents, which makes you realise how seldom you hear anything other than Home Counties, Estuary or Transatlantic sung on the British stage.

Even now, centuries after men took up dancing, ballet is seen as much odder than blowing a brass instrument or stripping in a working men's club. Proper boys charge down the street with football boots slung around their neck: Billy Elliot must be a weirdo because his shoes have pink ribbons instead of laces. </p> <p>Dancers at Wednesday's London premiere punched the air when Billy Elliot, played by Jamie Bell, finally expressed in words and movement what dancing meant to him. 'Yeah, that's what I feel - it is like electricity, like magic', admits Royal Ballet principal Sarah Wildor. She was invited to the premiere with her husband, the dancer Adam Cooper, who has a part in the film. They found themselves sitting next to Hugh Grant. 'You should have seen the expression on Sarah's face,' says Darcey Bussell. 'She was trying to pretend she hadn't noticed him - but he must have noticed her. She looked gorgeous.' </p> <p>For Bussell, the best bit was 'when the boy goes crazy in front of his dad. It's all that emotion you bottle up - and he found the way to let it out and really went for it. Like him, I wasn't stage-struck. I just loved burning off the fire inside me - it's an impulse you can't help'. Cooper agrees: 'As you get older, you tend to lose sight of what drove you to dance in the first place. You can be free of the real world, lose yourself in your dreams. At that age, I used to let off steam jumping around doing tap - ballet was much too hard'. </p> <p>Billy Elliot hits home because it is based on a true story. Scriptwriter Lee Hall rang the Royal Ballet three years ago and asked if any dancer came from a mining town. 'I do' volunteered Philip Mosley from Barnsley, a first artist in the company. He is the youngest of seven children, with an elder brother who was a militant miner. Both his grandfathers were miners, who offered to support him at ballet school if his parents couldn't cope. </p> <p>'I had to get up at 3am to travel in my father's car to London for the Royal Ballet auditions,' remembers Mosley. 'I told Lee how I'd never seen a ballet, let alone any of the exercises the other boys were doing in the changing room beforehand. My parents cried when I was accepted and they cried when they left me at the school. My twin brother hid in the car so I shouldn't see how much he missed me.' </p> <p>Without knowing it, Hall also hit on the boyhood story of Sir Kenneth MacMillan, the great Royal Ballet choreographer who died in 1992. His father had been a miner in Scotland and was unemployed in Great Yarmouth when his son declared he was going to become a ballet dancer. Kenneth's mother had died when he was 12, and for him, like Billy Elliot, dancing was his escape from grief, poverty and the grinding reality of everyday life. </p> <p>He, too, had an inspirational teacher - in fact, two. He did far more ballet lessons than he ever let on, either to his disapproving father or his schoolmates. He forged a letter in his father's name, asking Ninette de Valois for an audition for her Sadler's Wells Ballet School in 1944. When he was accepted, his father gave in - but never saw him dance. </p> <p>So what is the lure of ballet for children who, like MacMillan, like Mosley, may never have seen a professional performance? Instead of being packed off to ballet class by ambitious mothers, they discover its challenges for themselves. They already fantasise themselves as Fred Astaire: they have a natural sense of rhythm, a facility for tap, for expressing their inner life through energetic movement. Then they discover the lure of discipline; classical ballet technique is so rigorous that it obliterates every other thought. It is liberating because it frees the anxious mind of its internal monologue. </p> <p>'We were concerned with what got Billy going,' says Peter Darling, the film's choreographer. ' The dancing had to be part of the narrative, telling us who he is. So I worked with Jamie eight hours a day for three months, finding out what drove him as a dancer. He's fantastic because everything comes from the heart - there's a reason for every move'. </p> <p>Dancers watching the premiere, whether from the Royal Ballet or Matthew Bourne's Adventures in Motion Pictures, think Bell's a star - and the image of their younger selves.</p>",

In his 1897 The Invisible Man (subtitled 'A Grotesque Romance'), H.G. Wells lent a moral dimension to the phenomenon by having his mad scientist discover his evil, primitive side through invisibility in the manner of Dr Jekyll. </p> <p>Paul Verhoeven's <strong> Hollow Man</strong> follows a similar course, adding only special effects and state-of-the-art scientific mumbo-jumbo to James Whale's classic 1933 version of Wells's novel. </p> <p>The title refers to an overreaching, Porsche-driving scientist, Dr Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon), head of a secret research unit hidden beneath a Washington DC warehouse, set up by the Pentagon to explore the possibility of creating invisible agents. Making animals invisible is easy; making them visible again is apparently the problem. </p> <p>But once Caine has 'cracked reversion', he cons his team into letting him be the subject of the first human experiment. Faustian pranks are followed by Wellsian evil as Caine goes steadily mad, ending up stalking his assistants in their underground laboratory, like the monster in Alien . </p> <p>Technically impressive, but otherwise commonplace, the film's not unenjoyable. Inevitably, there's the lubriciousness we associate with Verhoeven, who, we infer, believes that all moviegoers are voyeurs, thus halfway to being invisible men and only too eager to spring on to the screen and indulge their lusts. </p> <p>In the 1930s, Hollywood film-makers were forced by the censors to invent what the philosopher Stanley Cavell dubbed 'the comedy of remarriage' (eg The Philadelphia Story, The Awful Truth, Mr and Mrs Smith) to deal in a light-hearted way with mature women and men by bringing them together not to be wed but to reunite them after separation or divorce. </p> <p>This form was no longer necessary when the Production Code was abandoned in 1967 and social mores changed. It was replaced by what we might call 'the relationship comedy', best exemplified by Annie Hall , in which the protagonists are able to survey with amused frankness a succession of sexual relationships without the viewer regarding them as promiscuous or immoral. But whereas the comedy of remarriage demanded deft plotting, the relationship comedy hardly needs a story at all, just a thread of memory and some bright lines. </p> <p>Writer-director Valerie Breiman's debut film, <strong> Love &amp; Sex</strong>, is a fairly typical example of the genre and has thirtysomething journalist, Kate Wells (Famke Janssen), looking back on her life wryly. It comprises 13, mostly unsatisfactory, relationships since losing her virginity to a French teacher in high school. The pretext is knocking off a 2,500-word article on relationships in an afternoon to keep her job on the Los Angeles-based magazine, Monique. </p> <p>Everything keeps reverting to the one real love of her life, the painter, Adam Levy (Jon Favreau), who's funny, kindly, overweight, romantic and the father of the child she miscarried. The trouble is that Adam has had only two previous affairs and, plagued by retrospective jealousy, he's left Kate so he can try to catch up. </p> <p>This is a lightweight version of Allen's masterpiece as seen from the point of view of Annie Hall who, in this case, is the one with gloomy tastes in movies (Kate's favourite is Murnau's Nosferatu). Janssen and Favreau are an attractive couple and they share the best lines. </p> <p>As Groucho Marx might have said, if you haven't got a wide berth, get hold of one before Fred Kelemen's <strong> Abendland</strong> and Harmony Korine's <strong> julien donkey-boy</strong> come your way. </p> <p>Because that's what you'll want to give to these ugly, incoherent, miserablist movies that believe they're making fundamental statements about the human condition. </p> <p>Each ends up with the leading character carrying a child through the streets (in one case, a girl murdered by pederasts; in the other, a stillborn baby). Both pictures look as if they've been shot through unwashed, frosted-glass windows and the experience of watching them is like being keel-hauled rather slowly. </p> <p> Abendland is set in a squalid, unnamed East German city near the Polish border (though, in fact, the locations are Portuguese) on one single night. The unemployed Anton breaks away from his lover, the laundry assistant, Leni, and the pair wander round the town, drinking and whoring. </p> <p>Anton strikes up an acquaintance with a crazed foundry worker who's lost his job because no one needs bells any longer. Leni picks up men in bars, humiliates Anton, is beaten by a sadistic client and finds refuge in a sleazy hotel-cum-nightclub, whose owner pays for his coke habit by pimping and hiring his billiard-room to homicidal pederasts. </p> <p>This slow, painful picture is evidently influenced by Andrei Tarkovsky, most especially his devastating Stalker, but lacking power and conviction, it neither observes the world we know nor creates a persuasive alternative. </p> <p>The 25-year-old Harmony Korine, who wrote the script for Larry Clark's Kids and directed the unintelligible Gummo, joined the Dogme group to make julien donkey-boy and in addition to awarding him their certificate of approval, they've lent him one of their cameramen and one of their editors. </p> <p>The result is a meaningless, random movie about a dysfunctional New York suburban family made up of a homicidal schizophrenic (Ewen Bremner) working at a home for the blind, an untalented teenage wrestler, their pregnant, harp-playing sister (Chlo\u00eb Sevigny), their querulous, overbearing father (Werner Herzog) and a doddering grandmother. </p> <p>It's often difficult to see their faces in the gloom and their actions are random and puzzling. Like Abendland, julien donkey-boy was shown in competition at Venice last year and has received plaudits on the festival circuit. But far from being the next big thing, it reminded me of the worst avant-garde pictures of the 1960s. </p> <p>In Carlos Saura's <strong> Goya in Bordeaux</strong>, the 82-year-old Spanish painter (Francisco Rabal) looks back over his life from his deathbed in French exile in 1828. It's a stylised movie, handsomely photographed by Vittorio Storaro, and very much in the style of the imaginative portraits of artists pioneered by Huw Weldon's Monitor . </p> <p>But it's an overly sedate account of a tempestuous life, there's much clunking dialogue ('Why don't you paint something happy, Francisco?' asks his young, last mistress), and one longs for the vigour of a Ken Russell. The wonderfully battered 75-year-old Rabal, however, is a striking presence.</p>",

In his 1897 The Invisible Man (subtitled 'A Grotesque Romance'), H.G. Wells lent a moral dimension to the phenomenon by having his mad scientist discover his evil, primitive side through invisibility in the manner of Dr Jekyll. Paul Verhoeven's Hollow Man follows a similar course, adding only special effects and state-of-the-art scientific mumbo-jumbo to James Whale's classic 1933 version of Wells's novel. The title refers to an overreaching, Porsche-driving scientist, Dr Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon), head of a secret research unit hidden beneath a Washington DC warehouse, set up by the Pentagon to explore the possibility of creating invisible agents. Making animals invisible is easy; making them visible again is apparently the problem. But once Caine has 'cracked reversion', he cons his team into letting him be the subject of the first human experiment. Faustian pranks are followed by Wellsian evil as Caine goes steadily mad, ending up stalking his assistants in their underground laboratory, like the monster in Alien . Technically impressive, but otherwise commonplace, the film's not unenjoyable. Inevitably, there's the lubriciousness we associate with Verhoeven, who, we infer, believes that all moviegoers are voyeurs, thus halfway to being invisible men and only too eager to spring on to the screen and indulge their lusts. In the 1930s, Hollywood film-makers were forced by the censors to invent what the philosopher Stanley Cavell dubbed 'the comedy of remarriage' (eg The Philadelphia Story, The Awful Truth, Mr and Mrs Smith) to deal in a light-hearted way with mature women and men by bringing them together not to be wed but to reunite them after separation or divorce. This form was no longer necessary when the Production Code was abandoned in 1967 and social mores changed. It was replaced by what we might call 'the relationship comedy', best exemplified by Annie Hall , in which the protagonists are able to survey with amused frankness a succession of sexual relationships without the viewer regarding them as promiscuous or immoral. But whereas the comedy of remarriage demanded deft plotting, the relationship comedy hardly needs a story at all, just a thread of memory and some bright lines. Writer-director Valerie Breiman's debut film, Love &amp; Sex, is a fairly typical example of the genre and has thirtysomething journalist, Kate Wells (Famke Janssen), looking back on her life wryly. It comprises 13, mostly unsatisfactory, relationships since losing her virginity to a French teacher in high school. The pretext is knocking off a 2,500-word article on relationships in an afternoon to keep her job on the Los Angeles-based magazine, Monique. Everything keeps reverting to the one real love of her life, the painter, Adam Levy (Jon Favreau), who's funny, kindly, overweight, romantic and the father of the child she miscarried. The trouble is that Adam has had only two previous affairs and, plagued by retrospective jealousy, he's left Kate so he can try to catch up. This is a lightweight version of Allen's masterpiece as seen from the point of view of Annie Hall who, in this case, is the one with gloomy tastes in movies (Kate's favourite is Murnau's Nosferatu). Janssen and Favreau are an attractive couple and they share the best lines. As Groucho Marx might have said, if you haven't got a wide berth, get hold of one before Fred Kelemen's Abendland and Harmony Korine's julien donkey-boy come your way. Because that's what you'll want to give to these ugly, incoherent, miserablist movies that believe they're making fundamental statements about the human condition. Each ends up with the leading character carrying a child through the streets (in one case, a girl murdered by pederasts; in the other, a stillborn baby). Both pictures look as if they've been shot through unwashed, frosted-glass windows and the experience of watching them is like being keel-hauled rather slowly. Abendland is set in a squalid, unnamed East German city near the Polish border (though, in fact, the locations are Portuguese) on one single night. The unemployed Anton breaks away from his lover, the laundry assistant, Leni, and the pair wander round the town, drinking and whoring. Anton strikes up an acquaintance with a crazed foundry worker who's lost his job because no one needs bells any longer. Leni picks up men in bars, humiliates Anton, is beaten by a sadistic client and finds refuge in a sleazy hotel-cum-nightclub, whose owner pays for his coke habit by pimping and hiring his billiard-room to homicidal pederasts. This slow, painful picture is evidently influenced by Andrei Tarkovsky, most especially his devastating Stalker, but lacking power and conviction, it neither observes the world we know nor creates a persuasive alternative. The 25-year-old Harmony Korine, who wrote the script for Larry Clark's Kids and directed the unintelligible Gummo, joined the Dogme group to make julien donkey-boy and in addition to awarding him their certificate of approval, they've lent him one of their cameramen and one of their editors. The result is a meaningless, random movie about a dysfunctional New York suburban family made up of a homicidal schizophrenic (Ewen Bremner) working at a home for the blind, an untalented teenage wrestler, their pregnant, harp-playing sister (Chlo\u00eb Sevigny), their querulous, overbearing father (Werner Herzog) and a doddering grandmother. It's often difficult to see their faces in the gloom and their actions are random and puzzling. Like Abendland, julien donkey-boy was shown in competition at Venice last year and has received plaudits on the festival circuit. But far from being the next big thing, it reminded me of the worst avant-garde pictures of the 1960s. In Carlos Saura's Goya in Bordeaux, the 82-year-old Spanish painter (Francisco Rabal) looks back over his life from his deathbed in French exile in 1828. It's a stylised movie, handsomely photographed by Vittorio Storaro, and very much in the style of the imaginative portraits of artists pioneered by Huw Weldon's Monitor . But it's an overly sedate account of a tempestuous life, there's much clunking dialogue ('Why don't you paint something happy, Francisco?' asks his young, last mistress), and one longs for the vigour of a Ken Russell. The wonderfully battered 75-year-old Rabal, however, is a striking presence.",

      "body": "<p>Denver, Colorado, is the mile-high city at the foot of the Rocky Mountains. It may be short on oxygen, but it is long on culture, with arguably the best-equipped performing arts centre in America. Since March, theatre people from all over the world - eight leading actors (four British and four American); 13 other American actors; an Irish composer; a Greek designer; a Japanese lighting designer - have been in Denver researching and rehearsing Tantalus , John Barton's 10-hour series of plays.</p> <p>It takes five weeks to rehearse a normal-length play: Tantalus has needed 26 weeks because of its length and because of the virtuosity that had to be developed by its actors.</p> <p>I am an old hand at epics: The Ring at Bayreuth took 16 weeks; The Wars of the Roses at Stratford nearly a year. So I know that while long rehearsals encourage proper work, they also demand endurance. We have had to stick at it like Tantalus himself, though I hope the resemblance ends there. The gap between his aspirations and achievements slowly drove Tantalus mad. As he reached forward for a bunch of desirable fruits, they were blown out of his reach. A large rock was suspended over Tantalus, specifically to amuse Zeus, because he could unloose it at any moment he chose. Our rock is unloosed in Denver on Saturday 21 October when Tantalus opens.</p> <p>Tantalus is a very contemporary exercise. Each play is a digestible hour, an episode of a shocking soap opera, and full of incest, violation and sexual betrayal. Who started this squalid little Trojan War? And who can think of a way of getting out of it without losing face? Was Helen of Troy raped, or was she willing? And how dare we men presume to behave like gods when we clearly still haven't learnt how to behave like men? Sometimes the plays seem chillingly apt. Here in Denver there is a tragic school called Columbine High. Their teachers rang the other day to ask if there was any nudity. If there were, they would be unable to bring a teenage party.</p> <p>Denver has allowed me nearly a year to try to find out how to do Tantalus. When I read the first draft I was excited, but I didn't think it was quite right. How could it be? A new piece of such ambition was bound to be initially indistinct here and there. Clearly it needed time. I read it when I was running the Old Vic. Initially it was hoped to be mounted there. All attempts (with the leadership of producer Michael Kustow and the RSC) to raise money in Europe proved inadequate. We even tried the Dome, but were told that they were not having theatre, as it was \u00e9litist and old-fashioned.</p> <p>It was Don Seawell that saved Tantalus, and we owe an enormous debt to him. He is the chairman and founder of the Denver Center for the Performing Arts. He is a great businessman, impresario, lawyer and patron of the arts. He has known John Barton for half a century and became a governor of the RSC when I started it in 1960. Years later, he has had the vision (and some would say the lunacy) to back Tantalus . 'Our endowment fund is very healthy and I want to do something special,' he said to me.</p> <p>It is difficult to describe this enterprise without hyperbole. It is by far the longest piece of new writing of recent years. It has rehearsed for half a year. It is the most expensive regional theatre production in America's history. But the money has not been spent on thousands of extras and huge sets. It has bought us time. Time stops theatre people taking easy solutions, or repeating ourselves; and it helps us meet the challenge of the new. Without time, theatre work is based on formula, not on discovery.</p> <p>It wasn't just the challenge that made me eager to be involved in Tantalus. I suppose I am working on it because I couldn't not - which may sound a silly reason, but is nonetheless real. I love John Barton, what he stands for and what he has done for the theatre. And Tantalus calls into play practically everything that interests me. It is expressed through lean, witty, verse - the speeches are constructed in quick three or four-beat lines, which are speedy, antithetical and frequently comic. It demands the use of music and movement; and it provokes the audience's imagination so that they believe the impossible.</p> <p>So if I am asked what on earth we did in 26 weeks of rehearsal, the answer is simple: we worked. We asked questions. We researched. We developed. We saw that research and development (something that is automatic in industry, business or in science) was an invaluable part of collaborative art.</p> <p>The scenes of Tantalus have been rehearsed as melodrama and as farce. We have mimed them, we have sung them, and we have expressed the actions by making primal sounds. We have worked in full mask and in half mask and in no mask. We have improvised. We have at all times revelled in the artificiality of theatre, in the fact that it is a game of make-believe which can persuade an audience to concentrate with the complete absorption of children at play. Theatre is not 'real'; it is not even true. It is rather a trust; a compact between actor and audience to pretend that what is being done can be imagined to be true. If this trust is violated by improbability or excess, the result is bad theatre.</p> <p>So Dionysis Fotopoulos has made his stage designs from the experience of rehearsal. The actors developed their costumes with him. Mick Sands, the composer, has built up his score from the very inflections and gut sounds of each scene. And I was surprised last week to see where our work had led us. This wasn't by imposing a concept, but through creating together. The production has, I hope, turned into a post-modernist surprise. Yet it remains Greek - a twenty-first century view of the past, distantly related to contemporary video games and animated films. As far as the process is concerned, it has been modern theatre at its healthiest. It has also been frequent hell, as well as heaven.</p> <p>One of the problems of a long rehearsal period is that real life obtrudes in a way that isn't possible in the month or six weeks normally given to a play. People have fallen in love (which has been fine); and out of love (which has occasionally been difficult). There have been illnesses and accidents, two walkouts, and one actor who couldn't (in my estimation) handle the particular form of the text, had to go. Dental operations, urgent visits to boyfriends, weddings and celebrations of grandmothers' birthdays have all taken their toll. This ferment of activity has gone on in public, because we have been (gratifyingly) much visited by journalists. The British journalists have been intrigued by the comings-and-goings, sensing a little spicy gossip perhaps. The Americans have been totally indifferent, accepting them as a normal part of showbusiness.</p> <p>I had two brilliant young directors with me because the vast size of this project demanded double and often triple rehearsals. Edward Hall had a prior commitment and had to be away for eight weeks to direct Henry V at Stratford. But I wanted him very much, not for family reasons (in work it never arises), but because he is very good. It is not his fault that he is my son.</p> <p>But then our other director, Mick Gordon of the Gate Theatre, went away too: first for a weekend to Argentina, which turned into 10 days because he got engaged; and then for a weekend to London from which he never returned. His agent wrote to Denver saying that there had been artistic differences. Since there hadn't been any, either with the cast, Edward or me, we all remain a mite bewildered.</p> <p>Sadly it has not been quite so easy with the author himself. I have known John Barton for 50 years, since student days at Cambridge. I have acted with him, directed with him, and often argued with him. When I was about to start the RSC it seemed natural to ask John to join me. He had been, in the meantime, a don at King's College, Cambridge, and in America. But he did not want to be an academic; he didn't even want to be a director, though he has proved himself to be one of the best. He has always wanted to be a writer; and what is more, a writer of plays. Now, in his seventies, he has given us Tantalus, and astonished all of his friends who thought he would never quite finish it. The full text now exists, and will shortly be published.</p> <p>But the full text is not what we are playing at Denver. We have had to cut and rearrange in the interest of making things work on the stage. It is ironical and sometimes painful that I now find myself editing my old friend's text, for John himself has often been the most ruthless editor of other men's plays.</p> <p>After the first three weeks in Denver, John went back to England of his own volition. He was worried about his health and needed his doctors. But I believe he was also disturbed and angry about the need for his vast work to be adapted. He said he had to leave it to me and went. He did not return and has been away for nearly all the rehearsals. Happily, he will be here during the opening sequence of performances.</p> <p>What should have been essentially a collaborative process with the author has turned into collaboration with the cast, my fellow directors and Colin Teevan, our dramaturge. It is not what I would have wished. I was always the final editor of this production otherwise I wouldn't have felt able to do it. But I prefer to have the dramatist in the rehearsal room.</p> <p>Last week, we played three-and-a-half hours of our epic to a preview audience. They not only seemed to understand the stories we were telling, they were apparently eager for more. The hooks of classical myth are still strong. 'Tell more and act less,' are my watchwords for the actors. Next week we shall offer another three-and-a-half hours; the week after, we shall finish the previews. Then, on 21 October, we shall put it all together in one day.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Denver, Colorado, is the mile-high city at the foot of the Rocky Mountains. It may be short on oxygen, but it is long on culture, with arguably the best-equipped performing arts centre in America. Since March, theatre people from all over the world - eight leading actors (four British and four American); 13 other American actors; an Irish composer; a Greek designer; a Japanese lighting designer - have been in Denver researching and rehearsing Tantalus , John Barton's 10-hour series of plays. It takes five weeks to rehearse a normal-length play: Tantalus has needed 26 weeks because of its length and because of the virtuosity that had to be developed by its actors. I am an old hand at epics: The Ring at Bayreuth took 16 weeks; The Wars of the Roses at Stratford nearly a year. So I know that while long rehearsals encourage proper work, they also demand endurance. We have had to stick at it like Tantalus himself, though I hope the resemblance ends there. The gap between his aspirations and achievements slowly drove Tantalus mad. As he reached forward for a bunch of desirable fruits, they were blown out of his reach. A large rock was suspended over Tantalus, specifically to amuse Zeus, because he could unloose it at any moment he chose. Our rock is unloosed in Denver on Saturday 21 October when Tantalus opens. Tantalus is a very contemporary exercise. Each play is a digestible hour, an episode of a shocking soap opera, and full of incest, violation and sexual betrayal. Who started this squalid little Trojan War? And who can think of a way of getting out of it without losing face? Was Helen of Troy raped, or was she willing? And how dare we men presume to behave like gods when we clearly still haven't learnt how to behave like men? Sometimes the plays seem chillingly apt. Here in Denver there is a tragic school called Columbine High. Their teachers rang the other day to ask if there was any nudity. If there were, they would be unable to bring a teenage party. Denver has allowed me nearly a year to try to find out how to do Tantalus. When I read the first draft I was excited, but I didn't think it was quite right. How could it be? A new piece of such ambition was bound to be initially indistinct here and there. Clearly it needed time. I read it when I was running the Old Vic. Initially it was hoped to be mounted there. All attempts (with the leadership of producer Michael Kustow and the RSC) to raise money in Europe proved inadequate. We even tried the Dome, but were told that they were not having theatre, as it was \u00e9litist and old-fashioned. It was Don Seawell that saved Tantalus, and we owe an enormous debt to him. He is the chairman and founder of the Denver Center for the Performing Arts. He is a great businessman, impresario, lawyer and patron of the arts. He has known John Barton for half a century and became a governor of the RSC when I started it in 1960. Years later, he has had the vision (and some would say the lunacy) to back Tantalus . 'Our endowment fund is very healthy and I want to do something special,' he said to me. It is difficult to describe this enterprise without hyperbole. It is by far the longest piece of new writing of recent years. It has rehearsed for half a year. It is the most expensive regional theatre production in America's history. But the money has not been spent on thousands of extras and huge sets. It has bought us time. Time stops theatre people taking easy solutions, or repeating ourselves; and it helps us meet the challenge of the new. Without time, theatre work is based on formula, not on discovery. It wasn't just the challenge that made me eager to be involved in Tantalus. I suppose I am working on it because I couldn't not - which may sound a silly reason, but is nonetheless real. I love John Barton, what he stands for and what he has done for the theatre. And Tantalus calls into play practically everything that interests me. It is expressed through lean, witty, verse - the speeches are constructed in quick three or four-beat lines, which are speedy, antithetical and frequently comic. It demands the use of music and movement; and it provokes the audience's imagination so that they believe the impossible. So if I am asked what on earth we did in 26 weeks of rehearsal, the answer is simple: we worked. We asked questions. We researched. We developed. We saw that research and development (something that is automatic in industry, business or in science) was an invaluable part of collaborative art. The scenes of Tantalus have been rehearsed as melodrama and as farce. We have mimed them, we have sung them, and we have expressed the actions by making primal sounds. We have worked in full mask and in half mask and in no mask. We have improvised. We have at all times revelled in the artificiality of theatre, in the fact that it is a game of make-believe which can persuade an audience to concentrate with the complete absorption of children at play. Theatre is not 'real'; it is not even true. It is rather a trust; a compact between actor and audience to pretend that what is being done can be imagined to be true. If this trust is violated by improbability or excess, the result is bad theatre. So Dionysis Fotopoulos has made his stage designs from the experience of rehearsal. The actors developed their costumes with him. Mick Sands, the composer, has built up his score from the very inflections and gut sounds of each scene. And I was surprised last week to see where our work had led us. This wasn't by imposing a concept, but through creating together. The production has, I hope, turned into a post-modernist surprise. Yet it remains Greek - a twenty-first century view of the past, distantly related to contemporary video games and animated films. As far as the process is concerned, it has been modern theatre at its healthiest. It has also been frequent hell, as well as heaven. One of the problems of a long rehearsal period is that real life obtrudes in a way that isn't possible in the month or six weeks normally given to a play. People have fallen in love (which has been fine); and out of love (which has occasionally been difficult). There have been illnesses and accidents, two walkouts, and one actor who couldn't (in my estimation) handle the particular form of the text, had to go. Dental operations, urgent visits to boyfriends, weddings and celebrations of grandmothers' birthdays have all taken their toll. This ferment of activity has gone on in public, because we have been (gratifyingly) much visited by journalists. The British journalists have been intrigued by the comings-and-goings, sensing a little spicy gossip perhaps. The Americans have been totally indifferent, accepting them as a normal part of showbusiness. I had two brilliant young directors with me because the vast size of this project demanded double and often triple rehearsals. Edward Hall had a prior commitment and had to be away for eight weeks to direct Henry V at Stratford. But I wanted him very much, not for family reasons (in work it never arises), but because he is very good. It is not his fault that he is my son. But then our other director, Mick Gordon of the Gate Theatre, went away too: first for a weekend to Argentina, which turned into 10 days because he got engaged; and then for a weekend to London from which he never returned. His agent wrote to Denver saying that there had been artistic differences. Since there hadn't been any, either with the cast, Edward or me, we all remain a mite bewildered. Sadly it has not been quite so easy with the author himself. I have known John Barton for 50 years, since student days at Cambridge. I have acted with him, directed with him, and often argued with him. When I was about to start the RSC it seemed natural to ask John to join me. He had been, in the meantime, a don at King's College, Cambridge, and in America. But he did not want to be an academic; he didn't even want to be a director, though he has proved himself to be one of the best. He has always wanted to be a writer; and what is more, a writer of plays. Now, in his seventies, he has given us Tantalus, and astonished all of his friends who thought he would never quite finish it. The full text now exists, and will shortly be published. But the full text is not what we are playing at Denver. We have had to cut and rearrange in the interest of making things work on the stage. It is ironical and sometimes painful that I now find myself editing my old friend's text, for John himself has often been the most ruthless editor of other men's plays. After the first three weeks in Denver, John went back to England of his own volition. He was worried about his health and needed his doctors. But I believe he was also disturbed and angry about the need for his vast work to be adapted. He said he had to leave it to me and went. He did not return and has been away for nearly all the rehearsals. Happily, he will be here during the opening sequence of performances. What should have been essentially a collaborative process with the author has turned into collaboration with the cast, my fellow directors and Colin Teevan, our dramaturge. It is not what I would have wished. I was always the final editor of this production otherwise I wouldn't have felt able to do it. But I prefer to have the dramatist in the rehearsal room. Last week, we played three-and-a-half hours of our epic to a preview audience. They not only seemed to understand the stories we were telling, they were apparently eager for more. The hooks of classical myth are still strong. 'Tell more and act less,' are my watchwords for the actors. Next week we shall offer another three-and-a-half hours; the week after, we shall finish the previews. Then, on 21 October, we shall put it all together in one day.",

      "trailText": "<p><strong> Billy Elliot </strong> (111 mins, 15) Directed by Stephen Daldry; starring Jamie Bell, Julie Walters, Gary Lewis</p>",
      "byline": "Philip French",

      "body": "<p><strong> Billy Elliot </strong> (111 mins, 15) Directed by Stephen Daldry; starring Jamie Bell, Julie Walters, Gary Lewis</p> <p>Writing briefly from Cannes, and comparing his film debut favourably with Lars von Trier's Dancer in the Dark, I called Stephen Daldry's Dancer (shown out of competition) 'Stepping Out meets Kes' and a 'sentimental crowd pleaser'. Daldry's film arrives in Britain under the new title of <strong> Billy Elliot</strong> (possibly he and screenwriter Lee Hall thought Dancer pretentious or fancy), and I wouldn't go back on what I wrote last May. It is a trifle sentimental. It will, I'm sure, prove a popular success. </p> <p>As in Kes, the vulnerable hero is called Billy, comes from a northern industrial town and has a brutal elder brother who scorns his hobby. Like Stepping Out, there's a star role for Julie Walters and a dancing class with only one male. But the movie is subtler, more graceful than anything suggested above. And the acting, editing, production design and photography are first-rate. </p> <p>From the opening credits, the film takes us into the mind and body of the 11-year-old Billy Elliot (Jamie Bell), as he bounces in slow motion to the strains of T. Rex's 'Cosmic Dancer', free as the air (or like electricity, as he later puts it). He maintains these rhythms as he makes breakfast in a clean but run-down terrace house. </p> <p>The year is 1984, the place a small mining town in Durham crawling with cops. Billy's elder brother (Jamie Draven) and widowed father (Gary Lewis) are on the NUM picket line; his kindly, senile grandmother (Jean Heywood) is in need of the attention no one can give her; his mother died two years before, at the age of 38. The dancing is a form of expression and a way of escape. </p> <p>Dad finds 50 pence a week for Billy to attend boxing classes at a local boys' club, which he does reluctantly, taking with him his grandfather's gloves, an obvious symbol of macho tradition. Due to the strike, the same premises are being used by a ballet class run by the blousy, good-natured, chain-smoking Mrs Wilkinson (Julie Walters). Billy stops to watch the dancing girls and is dared to join in by the teacher's precocious little daughter. He's hooked and secretly pays his 50p for ballet lessons. </p> <p>In a witty and touching montage, Daldry cuts between Billy's progress in class, his faltering attempts to learn from a book on ballet using the bathroom mirror, and his father, brother and grandmother responding to the same half-heard music. Naturally, Dad explodes when he finds out about the dancing ('Lads do football, lads do boxing, they don't do frigging ballet') and a contest ensues with Mrs Wilkinson, who has hopes of Billy winning a scholarship to the Royal Ballet School. </p> <p>The frustrated Mrs Wilkinson, the surrogate mother whose alcoholic husband has been made redundant, sees the promotion of Billy as the justification for her own life, and confronts the angry father, a similarly disillusioned person. But though the film takes her side, the movie doesn't turn Billy into a creature too good and sensitive for the dead-end, culturally impoverished world into which he's been born. </p> <p>Indeed there's an important scene where he shows a considerate, middle-class boy the same brutality he has himself endured. Nor is this, like Brassed Off or The Full Monty, a picture about turning a brave face to hard times and demonstrating the resilience of the working class. In the thrust of its narrative, and in the cross-cutting between the violent clashes on the picket lines and the dancing classes, Billy Elliot suggests that economic circumstances produce cultural changes, and that we must adapt to and, in some cases, embrace, them. The film offers the 1984-85 miners' strike as a defining moment when the values and attitudes created by industrial society lost their validity.

      "bodyText": "Billy Elliot (111 mins, 15) Directed by Stephen Daldry; starring Jamie Bell, Julie Walters, Gary Lewis Writing briefly from Cannes, and comparing his film debut favourably with Lars von Trier's Dancer in the Dark, I called Stephen Daldry's Dancer (shown out of competition) 'Stepping Out meets Kes' and a 'sentimental crowd pleaser'. Daldry's film arrives in Britain under the new title of Billy Elliot (possibly he and screenwriter Lee Hall thought Dancer pretentious or fancy), and I wouldn't go back on what I wrote last May. It is a trifle sentimental. It will, I'm sure, prove a popular success. As in Kes, the vulnerable hero is called Billy, comes from a northern industrial town and has a brutal elder brother who scorns his hobby. Like Stepping Out, there's a star role for Julie Walters and a dancing class with only one male. But the movie is subtler, more graceful than anything suggested above. And the acting, editing, production design and photography are first-rate. From the opening credits, the film takes us into the mind and body of the 11-year-old Billy Elliot (Jamie Bell), as he bounces in slow motion to the strains of T. Rex's 'Cosmic Dancer', free as the air (or like electricity, as he later puts it). He maintains these rhythms as he makes breakfast in a clean but run-down terrace house. The year is 1984, the place a small mining town in Durham crawling with cops. Billy's elder brother (Jamie Draven) and widowed father (Gary Lewis) are on the NUM picket line; his kindly, senile grandmother (Jean Heywood) is in need of the attention no one can give her; his mother died two years before, at the age of 38. The dancing is a form of expression and a way of escape. Dad finds 50 pence a week for Billy to attend boxing classes at a local boys' club, which he does reluctantly, taking with him his grandfather's gloves, an obvious symbol of macho tradition. Due to the strike, the same premises are being used by a ballet class run by the blousy, good-natured, chain-smoking Mrs Wilkinson (Julie Walters). Billy stops to watch the dancing girls and is dared to join in by the teacher's precocious little daughter. He's hooked and secretly pays his 50p for ballet lessons. In a witty and touching montage, Daldry cuts between Billy's progress in class, his faltering attempts to learn from a book on ballet using the bathroom mirror, and his father, brother and grandmother responding to the same half-heard music. Naturally, Dad explodes when he finds out about the dancing ('Lads do football, lads do boxing, they don't do frigging ballet') and a contest ensues with Mrs Wilkinson, who has hopes of Billy winning a scholarship to the Royal Ballet School. The frustrated Mrs Wilkinson, the surrogate mother whose alcoholic husband has been made redundant, sees the promotion of Billy as the justification for her own life, and confronts the angry father, a similarly disillusioned person. But though the film takes her side, the movie doesn't turn Billy into a creature too good and sensitive for the dead-end, culturally impoverished world into which he's been born. Indeed there's an important scene where he shows a considerate, middle-class boy the same brutality he has himself endured. Nor is this, like Brassed Off or The Full Monty, a picture about turning a brave face to hard times and demonstrating the resilience of the working class. In the thrust of its narrative, and in the cross-cutting between the violent clashes on the picket lines and the dancing classes, Billy Elliot suggests that economic circumstances produce cultural changes, and that we must adapt to and, in some cases, embrace, them. The film offers the 1984-85 miners' strike as a defining moment when the values and attitudes created by industrial society lost their validity. Received notions of what constitutes masculinity need modifying and an evening spent dancing on a stage can be as demanding as a night shift at the coal face, and more spiritually rewarding. Billy Elliot is sympathetic to the striking miners and respectful of their solidarity, but its politics are of a transcendental kind. For Billy, dancing is a solitary rather than social activity and we're shown him rejecting the tentative, amorous advances of a girl and a young boy. The escape he seeks, first through fantasy, then through professional discipline, isn't to another place or a different class. It's into a different state of mind, into a new relationship with the living world. A marvellous early image, which is echoed near the end, sees Billy dance up a steep, ugly backstreet. Behind him, there's a cloudless sky over a blue sea on which sails a single, fairy-tale boat heading on some magical journey. This captures the essence of the movie and takes the sarcasm out of the description of Billy by his teacher's embittered husband - 'Durham's own Gene Kelly'. Of course the film would not have worked had not Stephen Daldry discovered in Jamie Bell a dancer of easy dexterity, capable of expressing both Billy's inwardness and his boyish innocence.",

      "body": "<p>As the New England leaves were turning to gold in the autumn of 1975, an exclusive enclave of Greenwich, Connecticut, was stung to its pampered core by a crime that could, surely, have been committed only by an intruder to its world of yacht clubs, careful etiquette and restrained power. </p> <p>Martha Moxley, an effervescent blonde teenager, was horribly bludgeoned to death with a golf club and dumped in the garden of her parents' house in Belle Haven. She had been struck so hard that the shaft of the club broke into four pieces, only three of which were discovered at the scene of the crime. The grip, which might have had the fingerprints of the murderer on it, has never been found. The killer used one of the pieces, which had a sharp point, as a dagger and stabbed Martha through her neck. </p> <p>For years, her killer was barely sought and never found. Only after a quarter of a century did the net slowly tighten to encircle and finally entrap the man now accused of the murder: Michael Skakel, a neighbour of the dead child and high-society heir to one of the most prestigious fortunes in America, related by marriage to the Kennedy family. But that is just the prologue to the story of intrigue that surrounds the death of Martha Moxley. </p> <p>The tale itself is a tragic, gruesome, blue-blooded murder story at a hub which connects the spokes in the turning wheel of American power. The Kennedys, the Lewinsky scandal, the super-rich of Atlantic seaboard, the O.J. Simpson trial and more: almost every drama that has hallmarked America's recent past is there, stitched into a ghastly, painfully unfolding narrative. </p> <p>But even more intriguing than the story is the man who spent the past 10 years piecing it together, and why he did so. Dominick Dunne is an author and journalist who occupies a curious position - a blend of jester and ringmaster - at the heart of the American establishment, which he views through the lenses of his round, owlish spectacles like no one since since Truman Capote. The difference between the two men is that Capote was, as Dunne says, 'Inside, Inside', which is why he was in the end spat out. Dunne describes himself as 'Inside, Outside', which makes it strange that the celebrities of America feel compelled to embrace a fellow so potentially dangerous to their own reputations. </p> <p>Dunne knows everyone who is anyone, and they know him. He is living proof of the fact that celebrity is contagious. He has met so many celebrities he has become one himself. But in the story of Martha Moxley, Dunne demonstrates something else - his position is at the centre of a village green around which the supposedly far-flung dramatis personae of America's lambent high -life turns out to be huddled with intimate, indeed, claustrophobic, proximity. And that when one of their own does something appalling, they gather round... </p> <p>Although, like the Kennedys he came to know, he comes from a rich, Catholic Irish-American family, Dunne never had a silver spoon in his mouth. His life, which he himself describes as 'a very strange thing to have lived and be living', has been punctuated by pivotal moments of doubt and crisis. None has been more cogent or heartbreaking than that which has haunted him 'almost every minute' since it happened: the murder almost 20 years ago of his daughter, Dominique. </p> <p>'Everything in my life,' says Dunne, perched on the edge of a sofa in his apartment on the Upper East Side, 'stems from that.' And nothing more so than his interest in the hunt for the murderer of Martha Moxley. </p> <p>Dunne and the Moxley killing found each other as though they were waiting for each other. In 1991, Dunne was reporting for Vanity Fair on the trial, for rape, of William Kennedy Smith. This was an odd thing for him to be doing, since he had been a guest at Bobby Kennedy's wedding to Ethel Skakel in 1950, having befriended the Kennedy family through school connections on the Atlantic seaboard, and shared beach holidays with them in California. He was, in short, a family friend. </p> <p>During the trial, Dunne heard a rumour that 'Willie' had been a guest at the Skakel household in Belle Haven on the night of Martha Moxley's murder. The Skakel children, six unruly boys and a girl, were Willie's cousins. Their rich, widowed father, Rushton Skakel, was Ethel Kennedy's brother. The siblings had a wild reputation and a few of them, including Michael and Tommy, drank a good deal, although they were only teenagers. Tommy, then 17, was the last person to be seen with Martha on the night of her murder and had been considered a suspect for years. A golf club belonging to his dead mother, Ann Reynolds Skakel, had been used as the murder weapon, but no charges had ever been brought and the case was at a standstill. </p> <p>In the end, the rumour turned out to be false: Willie Smith had not been at the Skakel house in Greenwich the night Martha was killed. But Dunne's curiosity was aroused. 'Whatever happened to that case?' he recalls asking someone he knew in Greenwich. 'Nothing,' he was told. Dunne found himself wondering what had become of the dead child's mother, Dorthy Moxley. 'Somehow, I felt drawn to this woman,' he says. </p> <p>He wrote to her and they arranged to meet at a coffee bar in Baltimore airport, near where she was living. Dorthy was media-shy at the time and suspicious of a plan that Dunne had developed to base loosely a novel on her daughter's murder. He told her it might turn a spotlight on the dormant case. 'I also told her,' he says with understatement, 'that I, too, was the parent of a murdered daughter.' Their daughters had been born a year apart, and each was viciously attacked by a man she knew on 30 October, although in different years. </p> <p>That moment marked the beginning of Dunne's friendship with Dorthy: she said, yes, he could write the book. 'No one can understand Dorthy Moxley's pain like I can,' says Dunne. 'She didn't know it when she agreed to meet me but our eyes met, I told her my story, and we got it. And we'll never lose it, she's a friend, a friend for life'. </p> <p> Dunne's daughter Dominique was a fledgling and successful actress, best known for her role in Poltergeist, when she was strangled to death in 1983 by her boyfriend, John Sweeney, who feared that she was rejecting him. Sweeney successfully argued that the murder had been a crime of passion and was sentenced to two-and-a-half years for manslaughter. </p> <p>After the trial, 'I felt a madness growing in me,' says Dunne. 'I was filled with sorrow and rage, and that rage became my life. I hired private detectives to follow him. I was immersed in crazy thoughts about him and about her every second of my life. But then, one day, I decided that I cannot live like this; it'll destroy me. I realised that I had to have the talent to do something else with this'. </p> <p>At the time, he was beginning to make it in New York as a writer. He found an editor, Tina Brown at Vanity Fair, who believed in him and took him on to write an account first of Sweeney's trial, and then those of other suspected murderers and villains: the Menendez brothers, O.J. Simpson, Claus von Bulow, and many more. It was in Martha Moxley, however, that he found the story he needed. </p> <p>Dunne counselled her mother in what he himself had learned: 'I told her how I had made myself deal with this. Not in rage, or in despair, but in actually doing something. My daughter's death changed my life; it is the worst thing that can happen to anyone. But it did not destroy it. That is what I told her.' </p> <p>In this respect, Dunne's involvement in the Moxley case goes way beyond beyond luck and coincidence, of course - but also beyond journalism, especially American journalism, of which the very notion of neutrality is a sacred bedrock. 'I am a mover and a shaker in this story,' he admits with defiance. 'I am not the writer of this story, I am a player. I was a part of the story from the beginning, I made it happen, and I'll get criticised for that. But I don't care'. </p> <p> A Season in Purgatory, Dunne's novel based on the case, which blamed Martha's murder squarely on a thinly disguised Skakel, was published two years after his first meeting with Dorthy Moxley. It quickly became a best-seller and TV news networks carried stories about how it had helped revive interest in a 1975 murder case. Martha Moxley was back in the headlines. </p> <p>People with new evidence started to come forward almost at once, and presented themselves not to the police but to Dunne, who had begun to appear on television quite often, talking about Martha's murder. During a publicity tour for the book, he was approached by a forensic psychologist who had been hired early on by Greenwich police to act on the case. She told him that Tommy Skakel, until then the major suspect, was not the murderer. Dunne, too, had thought Tommy was guilty and had said so on television. 'She repeated it: \"It wasn't Tommy\". Her words haunted me,' Dunne says. </p> <p>The woman also showed him the autopsy photographs of Martha's body. One of the blows to her head had been so severe it had removed part of her scalp, which then hung over her face by a piece of skin. Propelled by the horror of what he saw, Dunne contacted the police in Connecticut to try and whip the case back to life, without success. They said the forensic psychologist had stolen the photographs. </p> <p>Two years later, the book was turned into a high-grade television mini-series and soon after it was broadcast, a young university graduate, whose identity Dunne protects, called him and, over lunch, related the contents of a private detective agency's report into the murder commissioned in 1991 by Rushton Skakel at a cost of some $750,000. </p> <p>Through a friend, the graduate had got the job of putting the detectives' findings into a narrative form. Rushton had wanted to take the spotlight of suspicion off his sons. But the report suggested that while Tommy had not killed Martha Moxley, the murderer could have been his brother, Michael. There was also a suggestion that Tommy may have helped him move Martha's body. </p> <p>This was ironic; the report which the old man had commissioned in the hope that it would exonerate his dear sons instead ended up implicating them. Rushton Skakel took it badly. An acknowledged alcoholic, he had already been devastated by the death of his wife from cancer two years before Martha's murder and, as a result, had struggled to keep his wayward, over-privileged offspring in line. This must have seemed the final blow. Rushton stashed the report away and it was never heard of until the young graduate handed it to Dominick Dunne. </p> <p>'I have,' Dunne reflects, 'the kind of life in which events seem to follow me around. I didn't go looking for this, it found me. I didn't go looking for those autopsy papers, they came to me. I didn't go looking for the Sutton report, some kid just called me up.' </p> <p>The next unsolicited call to Dunne introduced two further spheres of American drama into the narrative - one in Dunne's past. Lucianne Goldberg is best known nowadays as the woman who urged Linda Tripp to tape Monica Lewinsky's outpourings about her affair with President Clinton. But at that time, she was a literary agent Dunne had befriended. </p> <p>Goldberg represented Mark Fuhrman, the detective disgraced as a supposed racist during the O.J. Simpson trial, but whom Dunne nevertheless admired and had defended in print. Goldberg wanted to help Fuhrman, and Dunne decided that Fuhrman was exactly what was needed to prize open the Moxley murder case. </p> <p>Dunne's hunch about Fuhrman was a good one. Fuhrman pursued the case with a couple of accomplices. Grotesque details emerged: Michael Skakel, who had a perverse crush on Martha Moxley, apparently used to masturbate at her window, and even relieved himself over her corpse. Working with such material, as part of this new troika, Fuhrman produced a book called Murder in Greenwich, to which Dunne wrote an introduction, which in turn caused a grand jury to be called, to hear and question Michael Skakel. </p> <p> Dunne believes an upper-class conspiracy of silence protected Skakel for years and continues to do so. 'I believe that many people who lived in Belle Haven back then know things about the murder that they haven't told.' </p> <p>Last winter, he was stopped on the Upper East Side by a man who told him he used to be a friend of Michael Skakel's. He told Dunne that Skakel told him he was so drunk on the night of the murder he didn't remember whether he'd done it or not. When Dunne asked him his name, he walked away. Just three months ago, a woman came up to him in a bookshop in Vermont and told him that she was from Greenwich and knew where the grip of the golf club which had killed Martha was hidden. 'She said a lot of people in Greenwich know, but then she refused to talk further and walked out of the shop.' </p> <p>At the hearings earlier this year, the young heirs to the Kennedy name staked their reputation on a staunch defence of Michael Skakel. Skakel had looked after a foundation called the Citizens' Energy Foundation for Michael Kennedy after his brother, Joseph, commandeered him to be campaign manager in a possible run for the governorship of Massachusetts. Skakel had been a driver in the re-election campaign of the dynasty's patriarch, Teddy Kennedy, in 1994. Robert Kennedy Jnr had, three days before Skakel's indictment, accused Dunne of mounting a vendetta against Skakel and Fuhrman of financial greed. In the New York Times, he called Michael Skakel 'as honest as daylight... a genuinely good and decent soul'. And on 28 June, he went into court to insist he was not guilty. </p> <p>Reflecting on the Kennedy entwinement with both his own life and the Moxley case, Dunne can only say: 'Well, I went to the same school as Jack; I went to Bobby Kennedy and Ethel Skakel's wedding because we all knew each other from the beach and I was dating a friend of Ethel's. Then there we all were in court in Florida for Willie's trial; I was sitting across the aisle from the family. We lowered our eyes, we couldn't ever look at each other. Then they all come back again, in the Moxley murder.' </p> <p>While the Kennedys were defending their cousin before the grand jury, Michael Skakel sobbed. Who knows whether his were tears of rage or remorse. The judge ruled that there were probable grounds for suspicion that Skakel was Martha Moxley's murderer and that case should be sent for trial. Originally scheduled for this summer, it was postponed and a new date has yet to be set. But Dunne's work is done. 'Whatever happens next is up to the law,' he says in conversation, 'I have played my part.' </p> <p>Like the Skakels and Kennedys, the Dunne family had been cursed by tragedy before Dominique was murdered. Two of the five children born to Dunne and his wife, Lenny, died in infancy. Lenny herself is disabled. But you would not think, to look at him now, that such a past haunts Dunne. There is something dandyish about him, something fin-de-si\u00e8cle , with his puckish smile, small frame and immaculate suit and tie. </p> <p>No wonder the likes of Princess Diana, Gianni Versace and his mentor, Tina Brown, were entranced. But thinly veiled beneath Dunne's charm, perfect, whipped-cream manners and that kindly gaze is a layer of reinforced platinum, the kind one only acquires through knowing tragedy from the inside, whatever face you show the world, and even if you are, as he admits to being, 'a complete tart when it comes to going to parties'. </p> <p>'Most people have a turning point in their lives,' he says, 'and the murder of my daughter was mine. But there have been others, several in fact. I was 18 when they sent me into the Battle of the Bulge, and I saved someone's life. I was a scared little boy in that war, and that had a major effect on me. I didn't talk about it for years and years. I buried it deep - but I think the experience told me that I had something'. </p> <p>After the war came Hollywood, where he was a television and feature-film producer, but after Hollywood came deep depression, acute problems with alcohol and a seminal six months living in a log cabin in Oregon, which Dunne now calls the 'really important time, when I realised what was important in life, and what was not - by asking what all this bullshit in life in Hollywood was really doing for me'. He moved to New York in 1980, then, just as he was beginning to make it in New York, came the most devastating blow of all, the death of his daughter. </p> <p>Dunne's books and journalism are superficially glitzy, but deep down, he composes dark morality plays. The very notion of this makes him clap his hands and clasp one of mine. 'They are about right and wrong, good and evil,' he says, excited at the brute simplicity of his own formula. 'They're about good people and bad people.' Does this come from a Catholic upbringing? 'No,' he says, 'it comes from the murder of my daughter.' </p> <p>There is more than morality at play in the Moxley murder story, and in Dunne's other books and reports for Vanity Fair. For all that he likes to stack his prestigious invitation cards along the mantelpiece, there is an earthy, Irishman's sense of democracy within. 'I hate to see people getting away with things because of who they are,' he says. 'I hate to see cops get lazy and Michael Skakel rise above suspicion just because he was rich.' </p> <p>Dominick Dunne has a keen eye for the case of JonBenet Ramsey, the six-year-old beauty queen murdered in Colorado. He has not, yet, turned his pen to this case but he is angered by what he sees as the preferential treatment of the prime suspects, JonBenet's parents. </p> <p>'There's a grand jury,' fumes Dunne with a rare loss of composure, 'and they are called to testify. Now, I don't know if they murdered her or not, but they're the prime suspects and they don't even have to appear. They get to do it all by video, only because they are rich. Well, that's something that would never happen to a black family.' </p> <p>Dunne's next novel will, he says, 'be my last. I have written some good books but not a great book and I think I have it in me to write one great novel, if that's not too pompous. I can't imagine winding down, but I'm 75 next month, I have prostate cancer, and have to accept realities'. It will feature the same cast as his book, People Like Us, which was set among the New York glitterati wherein he circulates, and which both loves and fears him. </p> <p>'Inside but outside,' he ponders. 'I've always been like that. It can be done. What happened to Truman Capote was that he got inside the establishment and tried to stay. It's just a place to visit. The thing is, I never betrayed anyone. People know that I know more about them than I write, and that I never write it. That's what Truman Capote did - he wrote it all, he betrayed people. I write tough, but I never write mean.'</p>",

'Everything in my life,' says Dunne, perched on the edge of a sofa in his apartment on the Upper East Side, 'stems from that.' And nothing more so than his interest in the hunt for the murderer of Martha Moxley. Dunne and the Moxley killing found each other as though they were waiting for each other.

The siblings had a wild reputation and a few of them, including Michael and Tommy, drank a good deal, although they were only teenagers. Tommy, then 17, was the last person to be seen with Martha on the night of her murder and had been considered a suspect for years. A golf club belonging to his dead mother, Ann Reynolds Skakel, had been used as the murder weapon, but no charges had ever been brought and the case was at a standstill. In the end, the rumour turned out to be false: Willie Smith had not been at the Skakel house in Greenwich the night Martha was killed. But Dunne's curiosity was aroused. 'Whatever happened to that case?' he recalls asking someone he knew in Greenwich. 'Nothing,' he was told. Dunne found himself wondering what had become of the dead child's mother, Dorthy Moxley. 'Somehow, I felt drawn to this woman,' he says. He wrote to her and they arranged to meet at a coffee bar in Baltimore airport, near where she was living. Dorthy was media-shy at the time and suspicious of a plan that Dunne had developed to base loosely a novel on her daughter's murder. He told her it might turn a spotlight on the dormant case. 'I also told her,' he says with understatement, 'that I, too, was the parent of a murdered daughter.' Their daughters had been born a year apart, and each was viciously attacked by a man she knew on 30 October, although in different years. That moment marked the beginning of Dunne's friendship with Dorthy: she said, yes, he could write the book. 'No one can understand Dorthy Moxley's pain like I can,' says Dunne. 'She didn't know it when she agreed to meet me but our eyes met, I told her my story, and we got it. And we'll never lose it, she's a friend, a friend for life'. Dunne's daughter Dominique was a fledgling and successful actress, best known for her role in Poltergeist, when she was strangled to death in 1983 by her boyfriend, John Sweeney, who feared that she was rejecting him. Sweeney successfully argued that the murder had been a crime of passion and was sentenced to two-and-a-half years for manslaughter. After the trial, 'I felt a madness growing in me,' says Dunne. 'I was filled with sorrow and rage, and that rage became my life. I hired private detectives to follow him. I was immersed in crazy thoughts about him and about her every second of my life. But then, one day, I decided that I cannot live like this; it'll destroy me. I realised that I had to have the talent to do something else with this'. At the time, he was beginning to make it in New York as a writer. He found an editor, Tina Brown at Vanity Fair, who believed in him and took him on to write an account first of Sweeney's trial, and then those of other suspected murderers and villains: the Menendez brothers, O.J. Simpson, Claus von Bulow, and many more. It was in Martha Moxley, however, that he found the story he needed. Dunne counselled her mother in what he himself had learned: 'I told her how I had made myself deal with this. Not in rage, or in despair, but in actually doing something. My daughter's death changed my life; it is the worst thing that can happen to anyone. But it did not destroy it. That is what I told her.' In this respect, Dunne's involvement in the Moxley case goes way beyond beyond luck and coincidence, of course - but also beyond journalism, especially American journalism, of which the very notion of neutrality is a sacred bedrock. 'I am a mover and a shaker in this story,' he admits with defiance. 'I am not the writer of this story, I am a player. I was a part of the story from the beginning, I made it happen, and I'll get criticised for that. But I don't care'. A Season in Purgatory, Dunne's novel based on the case, which blamed Martha's murder squarely on a thinly disguised Skakel, was published two years after his first meeting with Dorthy Moxley. It quickly became a best-seller and TV news networks carried stories about how it had helped revive interest in a 1975 murder case. Martha Moxley was back in the headlines. People with new evidence started to come forward almost at once, and presented themselves not to the police but to Dunne, who had begun to appear on television quite often, talking about Martha's murder. During a publicity tour for the book, he was approached by a forensic psychologist who had been hired early on by Greenwich police to act on the case. She told him that Tommy Skakel, until then the major suspect, was not the murderer. Dunne, too, had thought Tommy was guilty and had said so on television. 'She repeated it: \"It wasn't Tommy\". Her words haunted me,' Dunne says. The woman also showed him the autopsy photographs of Martha's body. One of the blows to her head had been so severe it had removed part of her scalp, which then hung over her face by a piece of skin. Propelled by the horror of what he saw, Dunne contacted the police in Connecticut to try and whip the case back to life, without success. They said the forensic psychologist had stolen the photographs. Two years later, the book was turned into a high-grade television mini-series and soon after it was broadcast, a young university graduate, whose identity Dunne protects, called him and, over lunch, related the contents of a private detective agency's report into the murder commissioned in 1991 by Rushton Skakel at a cost of some $750,000. Through a friend, the graduate had got the job of putting the detectives' findings into a narrative form. Rushton had wanted to take the spotlight of suspicion off his sons. But the report suggested that while Tommy had not killed Martha Moxley, the murderer could have been his brother, Michael. There was also a suggestion that Tommy may have helped him move Martha's body. This was ironic; the report which the old man had commissioned in the hope that it would exonerate his dear sons instead ended up implicating them. Rushton Skakel took it badly. An acknowledged alcoholic, he had already been devastated by the death of his wife from cancer two years before Martha's murder and, as a result, had struggled to keep his wayward, over-privileged offspring in line. This must have seemed the final blow. Rushton stashed the report away and it was never heard of until the young graduate handed it to Dominick Dunne. 'I have,' Dunne reflects, 'the kind of life in which events seem to follow me around. I didn't go looking for this, it found me. I didn't go looking for those autopsy papers, they came to me. I didn't go looking for the Sutton report, some kid just called me up.' The next unsolicited call to Dunne introduced two further spheres of American drama into the narrative - one in Dunne's past. Lucianne Goldberg is best known nowadays as the woman who urged Linda Tripp to tape Monica Lewinsky's outpourings about her affair with President Clinton. But at that time, she was a literary agent Dunne had befriended. Goldberg represented Mark Fuhrman, the detective disgraced as a supposed racist during the O.J. Simpson trial, but whom Dunne nevertheless admired and had defended in print. Goldberg wanted to help Fuhrman, and Dunne decided that Fuhrman was exactly what was needed to prize open the Moxley murder case. Dunne's hunch about Fuhrman was a good one. Fuhrman pursued the case with a couple of accomplices. Grotesque details emerged: Michael Skakel, who had a perverse crush on Martha Moxley, apparently used to masturbate at her window, and even relieved himself over her corpse. Working with such material, as part of this new troika, Fuhrman produced a book called Murder in Greenwich, to which Dunne wrote an introduction, which in turn caused a grand jury to be called, to hear and question Michael Skakel. Dunne believes an upper-class conspiracy of silence protected Skakel for years and continues to do so. 'I believe that many people who lived in Belle Haven back then know things about the murder that they haven't told.' Last winter, he was stopped on the Upper East Side by a man who told him he used to be a friend of Michael Skakel's. He told Dunne that Skakel told him he was so drunk on the night of the murder he didn't remember whether he'd done it or not. When Dunne asked him his name, he walked away. Just three months ago, a woman came up to him in a bookshop in Vermont and told him that she was from Greenwich and knew where the grip of the golf club which had killed Martha was hidden. 'She said a lot of people in Greenwich know, but then she refused to talk further and walked out of the shop.' At the hearings earlier this year, the young heirs to the Kennedy name staked their reputation on a staunch defence of Michael Skakel. Skakel had looked after a foundation called the Citizens' Energy Foundation for Michael Kennedy after his brother, Joseph, commandeered him to be campaign manager in a possible run for the governorship of Massachusetts. Skakel had been a driver in the re-election campaign of the dynasty's patriarch, Teddy Kennedy, in 1994. Robert Kennedy Jnr had, three days before Skakel's indictment, accused Dunne of mounting a vendetta against Skakel and Fuhrman of financial greed. In the New York Times, he called Michael Skakel 'as honest as daylight... a genuinely good and decent soul'. And on 28 June, he went into court to insist he was not guilty. Reflecting on the Kennedy entwinement with both his own life and the Moxley case, Dunne can only say: 'Well, I went to the same school as Jack; I went to Bobby Kennedy and Ethel Skakel's wedding because we all knew each other from the beach and I was dating a friend of Ethel's. Then there we all were in court in Florida for Willie's trial; I was sitting across the aisle from the family. We lowered our eyes, we couldn't ever look at each other. Then they all come back again, in the Moxley murder.' While the Kennedys were defending their cousin before the grand jury, Michael Skakel sobbed. Who knows whether his were tears of rage or remorse. The judge ruled that there were probable grounds for suspicion that Skakel was Martha Moxley's murderer and that case should be sent for trial. Originally scheduled for this summer, it was postponed and a new date has yet to be set. But Dunne's work is done. 'Whatever happens next is up to the law,' he says in conversation, 'I have played my part.' Like the Skakels and Kennedys, the Dunne family had been cursed by tragedy before Dominique was murdered. Two of the five children born to Dunne and his wife, Lenny, died in infancy. Lenny herself is disabled. But you would not think, to look at him now, that such a past haunts Dunne. There is something dandyish about him, something fin-de-si\u00e8cle , with his puckish smile, small frame and immaculate suit and tie. No wonder the likes of Princess Diana, Gianni Versace and his mentor, Tina Brown, were entranced. But thinly veiled beneath Dunne's charm, perfect, whipped-cream manners and that kindly gaze is a layer of reinforced platinum, the kind one only acquires through knowing tragedy from the inside, whatever face you show the world, and even if you are, as he admits to being, 'a complete tart when it comes to going to parties'. 'Most people have a turning point in their lives,' he says, 'and the murder of my daughter was mine. But there have been others, several in fact. I was 18 when they sent me into the Battle of the Bulge, and I saved someone's life. I was a scared little boy in that war, and that had a major effect on me. I didn't talk about it for years and years. I buried it deep - but I think the experience told me that I had something'. After the war came Hollywood, where he was a television and feature-film producer, but after Hollywood came deep depression, acute problems with alcohol and a seminal six months living in a log cabin in Oregon, which Dunne now calls the 'really important time, when I realised what was important in life, and what was not - by asking what all this bullshit in life in Hollywood was really doing for me'. He moved to New York in 1980, then, just as he was beginning to make it in New York, came the most devastating blow of all, the death of his daughter. Dunne's books and journalism are superficially glitzy, but deep down, he composes dark morality plays. The very notion of this makes him clap his hands and clasp one of mine. 'They are about right and wrong, good and evil,' he says, excited at the brute simplicity of his own formula. 'They're about good people and bad people.' Does this come from a Catholic upbringing? 'No,' he says, 'it comes from the murder of my daughter.' There is more than morality at play in the Moxley murder story, and in Dunne's other books and reports for Vanity Fair. For all that he likes to stack his prestigious invitation cards along the mantelpiece, there is an earthy, Irishman's sense of democracy within. 'I hate to see people getting away with things because of who they are,' he says. 'I hate to see cops get lazy and Michael Skakel rise above suspicion just because he was rich.' Dominick Dunne has a keen eye for the case of JonBenet Ramsey, the six-year-old beauty queen murdered in Colorado. He has not, yet, turned his pen to this case but he is angered by what he sees as the preferential treatment of the prime suspects, JonBenet's parents. 'There's a grand jury,' fumes Dunne with a rare loss of composure, 'and they are called to testify. Now, I don't know if they murdered her or not, but they're the prime suspects and they don't even have to appear. They get to do it all by video, only because they are rich. Well, that's something that would never happen to a black family.' Dunne's next novel will, he says, 'be my last. I have written some good books but not a great book and I think I have it in me to write one great novel, if that's not too pompous. I can't imagine winding down, but I'm 75 next month, I have prostate cancer, and have to accept realities'. It will feature the same cast as his book, People Like Us, which was set among the New York glitterati wherein he circulates, and which both loves and fears him. 'Inside but outside,' he ponders. 'I've always been like that. It can be done. What happened to Truman Capote was that he got inside the establishment and tried to stay. It's just a place to visit. The thing is, I never betrayed anyone. People know that I know more about them than I write, and that I never write it. That's what Truman Capote did - he wrote it all, he betrayed people. I write tough, but I never write mean.'",

      "body": "<p>Are you a Bargain Ferret? A Car Booty? Or even an Empowered Consumer? These are all people who dabble in the ancient art of haggling. </p> <p>'Haggling is something the British consumer doesn't feel comfortable doing,' says Mike Godliman, director of Verdict Research. 'Generally people trust the big retailers. If they say \"We offer the lowest price\", people don't question it.' </p> <p>Yet things are changing, according to Godliman. 'Consumers in Britain are becoming much more confident, but they still feel more comfortable haggling over free delivery rather than price.' The recent protests over fuel prices, which really is haggling on a giant scale, seem to confirm the unwillingness of a once-meek British public to accept prices they do not like. </p> <p>'Haggling' may have a dirty resonance, whereas 'negotiating' sounds slick, skilful and strategic. 'Getting a bargain' resounds with the joy of the hunt and the rush that accompanies closure, the afterglow of which often exceeds the pleasure brought by the product itself. And 'bartering' has a quaint, old-fashioned air, evoking community-spirited images of a bundle of freshly dug vegetables being exchanged for half-a-dozen warm eggs. </p> <p>Yet today, all of the above are alive and kicking, fuelled by confidence gained through travel and also by the ability to gather comparative information from the internet. What is more, the retailers themselves - in the price slashing spirit of the year-round sale - are making people think twice before paying the asking price. </p> <p>Organisations such as LetsLink are inspiring people to view bartering as mutually beneficial - as networking is for businesses. A large part of what we do on the road to purchase is done as invisible haggling, in that we shop around to find the best deal, thus avoiding the potential embarrassment of any kind of confrontational 'Name your best price' bargaining. Nevertheless, some of us live for it. </p> <p>Indeed, even Charles Dickens had something to say on the subject, in Martin Chuzzlewit, when Jonas Chuzzlewit says: 'Here's the rule for bargains: \"Do other men, for they would do you\".' </p> <p>'For some people, it's a real game,' agrees Paul Edwards, director of the Henley Centre. 'Putting one over on the retailer can give you a good feeling.'</p> <p><strong>Room to negotiate </strong></p> <p>Holidays, antiques, organic onions... Get haggling </p> <p><strong>Travel </strong></p> <p>'The seasoned business traveller is always likely to negotiate,' explains Chris Allen of laterooms.com. 'But if you're a leisure customer, and you're ready for a break, haggling can add stress.'</p> <p>Allen claims that Laterooms.com 'takes some of the haggling stress out of the transaction,' as it provides information about hotels which are offering discounted rates.</p> <p>'The customer feels he's already got a bargain,' says Allen.</p> <p>Some international hotel chains, such as Hyatt, promote themselves on a 'Rate of the Day' bargain. Many other, smaller, hotels also change their rates daily, Allen says.</p> <p>While he maintains that laterooms is not a 'lifestyle site like lastminute', there are further ideas in the pipeline, including latecruise.com, easycover.com - which will advise on the best insurance deals to be had - and bargains.co.uk, which will offer discounted products from retailers.</p> <p>Yet it's worth bearing in mind that if a hotel is not busy, there's no harm in asking for a discount.</p> <p><strong>Cars and houses </strong></p> <p>For the big things - cars and houses - negotiating on price is something we tend to do without thinking - and without necessarily using the 'h' word.</p> <p>'At the moment, more negotiating has crept in as the market has shifted towards the buyer,' says Hugh Dunsmore-Hardy, chief executive of the National Association of Estate Agents. 'Although we're not necessarily a nation of hagglers, we want to find a bargain but we prefer not to get into the nitty gritty of money.'</p> <p>On the internet, sites such as rightmove.co.uk, assertahome.com and the soon to be launched 'AskDaisy' are all grist to the mill for would-be house buyers.</p> <p>And as for cars, 'there's been a quiet revolution over the past few years', admits Charles Hallett from What Car?

      "bodyText": "Are you a Bargain Ferret? A Car Booty? Or even an Empowered Consumer? These are all people who dabble in the ancient art of haggling. 'Haggling is something the British consumer doesn't feel comfortable doing,' says Mike Godliman, director of Verdict Research. 'Generally people trust the big retailers. If they say \"We offer the lowest price\", people don't question it.' Yet things are changing, according to Godliman. 'Consumers in Britain are becoming much more confident, but they still feel more comfortable haggling over free delivery rather than price.' The recent protests over fuel prices, which really is haggling on a giant scale, seem to confirm the unwillingness of a once-meek British public to accept prices they do not like. 'Haggling' may have a dirty resonance, whereas 'negotiating' sounds slick, skilful and strategic. 'Getting a bargain' resounds with the joy of the hunt and the rush that accompanies closure, the afterglow of which often exceeds the pleasure brought by the product itself. And 'bartering' has a quaint, old-fashioned air, evoking community-spirited images of a bundle of freshly dug vegetables being exchanged for half-a-dozen warm eggs. Yet today, all of the above are alive and kicking, fuelled by confidence gained through travel and also by the ability to gather comparative information from the internet. What is more, the retailers themselves - in the price slashing spirit of the year-round sale - are making people think twice before paying the asking price. Organisations such as LetsLink are inspiring people to view bartering as mutually beneficial - as networking is for businesses. A large part of what we do on the road to purchase is done as invisible haggling, in that we shop around to find the best deal, thus avoiding the potential embarrassment of any kind of confrontational 'Name your best price' bargaining. Nevertheless, some of us live for it. Indeed, even Charles Dickens had something to say on the subject, in Martin Chuzzlewit, when Jonas Chuzzlewit says: 'Here's the rule for bargains: \"Do other men, for they would do you\".' 'For some people, it's a real game,' agrees Paul Edwards, director of the Henley Centre. 'Putting one over on the retailer can give you a good feeling.' Room to negotiate Holidays, antiques, organic onions... Get haggling Travel 'The seasoned business traveller is always likely to negotiate,' explains Chris Allen of laterooms.com. 'But if you're a leisure customer, and you're ready for a break, haggling can add stress.' Allen claims that Laterooms.com 'takes some of the haggling stress out of the transaction,' as it provides information about hotels which are offering discounted rates. 'The customer feels he's already got a bargain,' says Allen. Some international hotel chains, such as Hyatt, promote themselves on a 'Rate of the Day' bargain. Many other, smaller, hotels also change their rates daily, Allen says. While he maintains that laterooms is not a 'lifestyle site like lastminute', there are further ideas in the pipeline, including latecruise.com, easycover.com - which will advise on the best insurance deals to be had - and bargains.co.uk, which will offer discounted products from retailers. Yet it's worth bearing in mind that if a hotel is not busy, there's no harm in asking for a discount. Cars and houses For the big things - cars and houses - negotiating on price is something we tend to do without thinking - and without necessarily using the 'h' word. 'At the moment, more negotiating has crept in as the market has shifted towards the buyer,' says Hugh Dunsmore-Hardy, chief executive of the National Association of Estate Agents. 'Although we're not necessarily a nation of hagglers, we want to find a bargain but we prefer not to get into the nitty gritty of money.' On the internet, sites such as rightmove.co.uk, assertahome.com and the soon to be launched 'AskDaisy' are all grist to the mill for would-be house buyers. And as for cars, 'there's been a quiet revolution over the past few years', admits Charles Hallett from What Car? 'People have realised that we're paying more than in other countries, so they're less inclined to walk to their local dealerships. They'll also shop around with car insurance.' Hallett says consumers are shopping around on the internet and then taking the 'dotcom prices' - from the likes of jamjar.com and virgin.com - to the car retailers. Antiques This is another world familiar with negotiating skills. 'It's a splendid example of the marketplace,' says Michael Sparrow, an antiques dealer. 'There's no fixed price - that's the big thing. If people say to me: \"What's the best price you can do?\" I take money off.' 'The Antiques Roadshow has ruined the business,' he laments. 'It's given people inflated ideas about what their things are worth. They see something on television and they think they've got something similar, but quite often they're not comparing like with like.' Salaries Getting a good deal doesn't only apply to persuading someone to lower their price. In Observer journalist Neasa MacErlean's book Get More From Work and More Fun , published by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, tips such as preparing your case, providing supporting evidence of your achievements, considering timing, and not threatening to walk out unless you can afford to do it, are defined to help people galvanise themselves into discussing money with their employer. The 'if you don't ask, you won't get' attitude would seem to apply just as much when asking for less as when asking for more. Food The increase of farmers' markets is generating a new enthusiasm for traditional practices, and trying to bargain is all part of the experience. At the end of the day, stallholders barter with each other so that they don't have to take home unsold stock. And in the supermarkets,too, marketeers and store designers have worked hard to recreate the charm of old-fashioned marketplaces. In keeping with this spirit, it is worth practising your bargaining techniques at the fish counter or at the deli counter. But don't try it at the checkout: it will cause havoc. Who's who of hagglers The Car Booties People who are short of money; they are haggling for goods out of necessity. The Empowered Consumers Quite well-off, these people haggle because they enjoy the chase. The Bargain Ferrets Those who take a moral stand. They've read about rip-off retailers, possibly in the Daily Mail , and they are outraged by overpricing. (Research provided by The Henley Centre",

      "body": "<p>The build-up to Christmas 1999 was slightly more fraught than usual. I'd been working flat out for four months on a solo exhibition of my prints, not to mention bringing up three teenage children on my own, and settling a long, drawn-out divorce. Looking back, things were out of control. The show had been a virtual sell-out, and my divorce settlement meant that I was financially comfortable for the first time in a decade, but the logistics of my life were a nightmare. I had done nothing to prepare for Christmas, over-booked my social life and, to crown it all, my youngest daughter was appearing at Sadler's Wells and had to be driven to and collected from the theatre every other night.</p> <p>On the morning of 20 December, I had to take down the show, and although I was very tired afterwards, I decided to go shopping before delivering pictures. At least I had ordered the turkey and baked a Christmas cake that morning. I recall looking at the calendar on the wall - every day was bursting with arrangements - and thinking that I didn't know how I would cope. I wasn't eating properly, and smoking nearly 30 cigarettes a day. Still, I'd always been a high-energy person with plenty of reserves to fall back on.</p> <p>That night I was going to meet friends in a restaurant near our home in east London with my two youngest children. I put on a ton of make-up to hide the huge bags under my eyes and tried to look as glamorous as possible. I then shouted hideously at my sweet-natured youngest child for not being ready, and I wondered later if that had caused something to burst in my brain, but I was assured by a doctor that it was a symptom of my impending illness, so at least I hadn't caused it by blowing a gasket.</p> <p>I kept looking in the A-Z to find the most direct route to the restaurant, but couldn't seem to get my head round map reading. We drove round the corner and I began to feel a little odd - then suddenly pain exploded in my head like a mallet being driven down into my skull. I'd had an appalling headache five days before, but nothing like this. I tried to drive back home - I was frightened for the children, but I had to pull over. We got out of the car and I slumped against a wall. My son dashed off to fetch a friend who is a GP and lives nearby. I thought this was my moment of death - this was it . I still believe that this is what dying will be like.</p> <p>My GP friend took me back to her house and put me to bed. The pain was awful, I was dozing in and out of consciousness and we decided to go to the local hospital. I noticed one foot dragged a little as we walked to the car. Eventually, I was sent home with a suspected migraine. By the time I got home, I had developed excruciating backache on top of the headache. Both eased for a while, but then I had a second attack the next night - my head and back were now unbearably painful, and by the next morning I had started vomiting and feeling faint. We called an ambulance and I was admitted with a suspected sub-arachnoid haemorrhage - or a bleed in the lining of my brain.</p> <p>I had a CAT scan which showed no bleeding around my brain, but then a series of bungled lumbar punctures made it impossible to detect if there was any blood in my spinal fluid - the same fluid that surrounds the brain. A final, successful puncture did reveal some blood, but it was impossible to tell if this was caused by the botched punctures or a haemorrhage, although the latter seemed likely. I was given huge amounts of codeine and told to lie still. I was very frightened - everyone seemed to be watching but I wasn't having any treatment.</p> <p>Eventually, I was transferred to the Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel on Christmas Eve. A brain surgeon explained that I probably had a cerebral aneurysm (a ballooning of an artery in the lining of the brain) which can cause severe brain damage or death if it bursts. If so, I would need surgery immediately. I imagined my children at home on Christmas Eve with my parents - I missed them so badly, and now I was very frightened for them.</p> <p>The next day, Christmas Day, Dr Paul Butler, a consultant neuroradiologist, left his family celebration to give me a cerebral angiogram - dye is injected into the blood stream to detect an aneurysm. I was scared. I was lying on a bed beneath a bank of television screens. It felt surreal. Local anaesthetic was injected into my groin and an artery accessed. I felt a warm sensation behind one ear as the dye went up a catheter into a specific area of my brain. Looking up at the screens, I could see the inside of my brain with my eyes - my brain was working, while I was looking inside it. I will never make sense of that moment. And on top of all that there was an aesthetic reaction. The inside of my brain and the blood vessels were quite beautiful.</p> <p>Dr Butler did not find an aneurysm, which is the main cause of a sub-arachnoid haemorrhage, so what had happened in my case? The bungled lumbar punctures did not help with the diagnosis, but I was discharged as having had a sub-arachnoid haemorrhage, probably a spontaneous bleed which had sealed itself off. Whatever had happened, I had got away with it. The recovery was slow - six weeks in bed with my family looking after me, chronic backache and exhaustion, and a funny feeling in my head for months. Now I am better - I have given up smoking, go to the gym three times a week and rest when I am tired. But I seem to have permanently lost those reserves of energy.</p> <p>Still, what I have seen on the brain scans is central to everything I have been thinking and drawing since. Dr Butler gave me permission to go back to the hospital to draw cerebral angiograms taking place. I was struck by the strange beauty of the images - nearly dancing forests of arteries in the landscape of the brain.</p> <p>One woman had a sub-arachnoid haemorrhage and Dr Butler was sure she would have an aneurysm and asked the technician to change angles and investigate every part of the brain. Then I saw it. A small bubble on the edge of an artery, which I had never seen on my scans, although I was scared that one lay undetected in my brain and sometimes imagine I can feel it in my head in bed at night.</p> <p><b> What is a sub-arachnoid haemorrhage?</b> <br> Bleeding into the cerebro spinal fluid that surrounds the surface of the brain, (the arachnoid is the membrane that covers the surface). In one in three cases, it will be fatal, and one in two survivors will die if not treated within two months. It can be caused by abnormalities in the blood vessels, a blood clot or may have no identifiable cause, but in the majority of cases it is the result of rupturing of a cerebral aneurysm, a ballooning of an artery in the brain. This is, potentially, an extremely dangerous condition and in a third of cases patients die, many without reaching hospital. Another third will suffer brain damage and another third will recover with surgery. In many cases, a slight bleed will occur before a second major one, and this is why it is vital to detect blood in the spinal fluid with a CT scan or lumbar puncture, and the location of a possible aneurysm with an angiogram.</p> <p><b> What is the cause?</b> <br> An aneurysm can be present, but only detected if it balloons or causes pressure on the brain. No one is sure what causes an aneurysm, although it is 2.5 times more likely to occur in women who smoke (figures aren't available for men). High blood pressure is another risk factor. There are rarely any warning signs for either. A subsequent attack is no more likely among previous sufferers than among non-sufferers.</p> <p><b> Who is at risk?</b> <br> Sub-arachnoid haemorrhages affect 8,500 people a year in England. It can strike at any time, but the peak age is 40 to 75. It is more common in females by a ratio of 3 to 2, although nobody understands why. Recent sufferers of cerebral aneurysm include the actress Jane Lapotaire, Teresa Wells, wife of the actor John Wells, and Myra Hindley.</p> <p><b> Can it be treated?</b> <br> A sub-arachnoid hamorrhage can be treated by removing malformed vessels. If the bleed is only slight, with no aneurysm, rest and a subsequent angiogram will be prescribed. An aneurysm can be clipped to prevent bleeding, which entails open surgery, or as at the Royal London, very fine wire coils can be inserted through a catheter into the aneurysm. A slight electrical current causes the blood to clot around the coils, thus blocking a potential bleed.</p> <p><b> Support groups</b> <br> The British Brain and Spine Foundation produces a booklet and has a helpline run by neuroscience nurses (0808 808 1000).

      "bodyText": "The build-up to Christmas 1999 was slightly more fraught than usual. I'd been working flat out for four months on a solo exhibition of my prints, not to mention bringing up three teenage children on my own, and settling a long, drawn-out divorce. Looking back, things were out of control. The show had been a virtual sell-out, and my divorce settlement meant that I was financially comfortable for the first time in a decade, but the logistics of my life were a nightmare. I had done nothing to prepare for Christmas, over-booked my social life and, to crown it all, my youngest daughter was appearing at Sadler's Wells and had to be driven to and collected from the theatre every other night. On the morning of 20 December, I had to take down the show, and although I was very tired afterwards, I decided to go shopping before delivering pictures. At least I had ordered the turkey and baked a Christmas cake that morning. I recall looking at the calendar on the wall - every day was bursting with arrangements - and thinking that I didn't know how I would cope. I wasn't eating properly, and smoking nearly 30 cigarettes a day. Still, I'd always been a high-energy person with plenty of reserves to fall back on. That night I was going to meet friends in a restaurant near our home in east London with my two youngest children. I put on a ton of make-up to hide the huge bags under my eyes and tried to look as glamorous as possible. I then shouted hideously at my sweet-natured youngest child for not being ready, and I wondered later if that had caused something to burst in my brain, but I was assured by a doctor that it was a symptom of my impending illness, so at least I hadn't caused it by blowing a gasket. I kept looking in the A-Z to find the most direct route to the restaurant, but couldn't seem to get my head round map reading. We drove round the corner and I began to feel a little odd - then suddenly pain exploded in my head like a mallet being driven down into my skull. I'd had an appalling headache five days before, but nothing like this. I tried to drive back home - I was frightened for the children, but I had to pull over. We got out of the car and I slumped against a wall. My son dashed off to fetch a friend who is a GP and lives nearby. I thought this was my moment of death - this was it . I still believe that this is what dying will be like. My GP friend took me back to her house and put me to bed. The pain was awful, I was dozing in and out of consciousness and we decided to go to the local hospital. I noticed one foot dragged a little as we walked to the car. Eventually, I was sent home with a suspected migraine. By the time I got home, I had developed excruciating backache on top of the headache. Both eased for a while, but then I had a second attack the next night - my head and back were now unbearably painful, and by the next morning I had started vomiting and feeling faint. We called an ambulance and I was admitted with a suspected sub-arachnoid haemorrhage - or a bleed in the lining of my brain. I had a CAT scan which showed no bleeding around my brain, but then a series of bungled lumbar punctures made it impossible to detect if there was any blood in my spinal fluid - the same fluid that surrounds the brain. A final, successful puncture did reveal some blood, but it was impossible to tell if this was caused by the botched punctures or a haemorrhage, although the latter seemed likely. I was given huge amounts of codeine and told to lie still. I was very frightened - everyone seemed to be watching but I wasn't having any treatment. Eventually, I was transferred to the Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel on Christmas Eve. A brain surgeon explained that I probably had a cerebral aneurysm (a ballooning of an artery in the lining of the brain) which can cause severe brain damage or death if it bursts. If so, I would need surgery immediately. I imagined my children at home on Christmas Eve with my parents - I missed them so badly, and now I was very frightened for them. The next day, Christmas Day, Dr Paul Butler, a consultant neuroradiologist, left his family celebration to give me a cerebral angiogram - dye is injected into the blood stream to detect an aneurysm. I was scared. I was lying on a bed beneath a bank of television screens. It felt surreal. Local anaesthetic was injected into my groin and an artery accessed. I felt a warm sensation behind one ear as the dye went up a catheter into a specific area of my brain. Looking up at the screens, I could see the inside of my brain with my eyes - my brain was working, while I was looking inside it. I will never make sense of that moment. And on top of all that there was an aesthetic reaction. The inside of my brain and the blood vessels were quite beautiful. Dr Butler did not find an aneurysm, which is the main cause of a sub-arachnoid haemorrhage, so what had happened in my case? The bungled lumbar punctures did not help with the diagnosis, but I was discharged as having had a sub-arachnoid haemorrhage, probably a spontaneous bleed which had sealed itself off. Whatever had happened, I had got away with it. The recovery was slow - six weeks in bed with my family looking after me, chronic backache and exhaustion, and a funny feeling in my head for months. Now I am better - I have given up smoking, go to the gym three times a week and rest when I am tired. But I seem to have permanently lost those reserves of energy. Still, what I have seen on the brain scans is central to everything I have been thinking and drawing since. Dr Butler gave me permission to go back to the hospital to draw cerebral angiograms taking place. I was struck by the strange beauty of the images - nearly dancing forests of arteries in the landscape of the brain. One woman had a sub-arachnoid haemorrhage and Dr Butler was sure she would have an aneurysm and asked the technician to change angles and investigate every part of the brain. Then I saw it. A small bubble on the edge of an artery, which I had never seen on my scans, although I was scared that one lay undetected in my brain and sometimes imagine I can feel it in my head in bed at night. What is a sub-arachnoid haemorrhage? Bleeding into the cerebro spinal fluid that surrounds the surface of the brain, (the arachnoid is the membrane that covers the surface). In one in three cases, it will be fatal, and one in two survivors will die if not treated within two months.

      "body": "<p>It was 15 years since I'd ridden a scooter - and then only along the wide, uncluttered avenues of a small American city. So it seemed wise - not to mention compulsory - to take my safety test before negotiating the clogged-up, gnarly backstreets of London. It wasn't with any great excitement that I traipsed across the city to spend a day doing bike drills and learning about road handling. Nor did my spirits lift when I entered the test centre at 8.30 one Monday morning and found it heaving with veteran bikers shuffling about in full-body leathers, creaking and squelching in unison. And they were just the instructors. I wondered, momentarily, if I'd stumbled into a queue for tickets for Motorhead's latest concert. </p> <p>It seemed odd to be lectured on safety by a group of pony-tailed road veterans who looked as though they might slice in and out of motorway traffic for fun. In fact, it was all the more convincing for that - to be warned of the dangers of two-wheelers by inveterate bikers who'd witnessed their share of road carnage was all the more sobering. I left in a state of some trepidation, reminding myself never to forget the 'life-saver' - the glance over your left or right shoulder before any turning manoeuvre. </p> <p>Things began well enough. I was testing a Piaggio Liberty which, at 125cc, is at the upper limit of what you can ride without a full bike licence. Travelling home on my first evening I was congratulating myself on the number of 'life-savers' I was casting about. Once home I thought it best to bring the bike into the front room rather than leave it outside where the local 14-year-olds tend to borrow them without, as it were, permission. </p> <p>However, to take this rather elaborate security measure I had to cross the raised threshold. Alas, finding myself with insufficient power to negotiate this little hurdle I decided - rashly you may well think - to apply a little accelerator to ease my path. Big mistake. Not only did this power me across the threshold but it also propelled me into the front room. Having just moved in, the room was near empty, save for an old cooker and table awaiting a skip. </p> <p>Once over the threshold, the bike - intoxicated with an open throttle - really got into its stride. It powered impressively into the cooker, then bounced off the table. I grabbed the brake, but since the brake and accelerator are on the same right-hand handle it meant I was throttling the bike, while still trying to brake. Which is not ideal. The rear wheel made sterling attempts to get ahead of the front wheel. It was skidding inexorably for the wall at the far end. Sensing an untimely end to this scooter test, I managed to part company from the bike before any real damage was done to either me, the wall or the bike. The old cooker didn't get off so lightly. </p> <p>It was an early warning of the bike's power, and the control it's best to exercise over it. Though it looks smart - a calculated mix of retro and modern - this is a surprisingly heavy and powerful machine. By the end of my four-week stint I was fairly certain that my biceps had doubled, since just moving and rolling it took a fair effort. Of course it also meant that it was powerful and fast - it can reach close to 75mph, though one could feel all too vulnerable at this speed. The size of the bike also means that it is a sturdy city scooter, designed to roll over rough London terrain without feeling as though you've worked a pneumatic drill all day. The Liberty 125 gives a smooth, strong, enjoyable ride and its size allows you to feel more confident on the road. And, of course, it performs particularly well indoors. </p> <p>Having tried the light-heavyweight Liberty, I thought it only best to sample something a little lighter, this time from Italy's other great scooter manufacturer, Malaguti. Their 50cc Yesterday is a devilishly handsome little bike. This is Italian design at its best - beautiful smooth lines. But it is small, and anyone over 5ft 9in should probably look elsewhere since the leg room is a mite cramped. But it's certainly more mobile and nippy than a Liberty and much lighter for handling, making it a lot less intimidating for novice bikers. On the downside, it's nowhere near as robust for negotiating the dips and dives of London's battered streets. But if you should want a compact, tidy and smart scooter, you may not need to look elsewhere. </p> <p>Both Piaggio and Malaguti have a host of other models you could choose from and it's not a bad idea to check out some websites to see what's on offer, and what bikers say about them. In truth, either will perform well around the city - particularly in a petrol crisis.</p>",

      "body": "<p>I don't know if you've ever 'done your lower back in' - if not, I hope you never do, or if you have, may you never do so again. I'm not on about chronic backache - this is about the sudden variety, the skewed sacro-illiac joint affair, the kind that seems to come out of almost nowhere - perhaps bending over the sink, or even stretching before getting out of bed. The sort that has you walking completely lop-sided and bent over, emitting a series of grunts, groans and stifled screams as you valiantly attempt the sharply painful transition between one position and another.</p> <p>At first you go into denial. You didn't really make that movement. This pain isn't really there. It's all in the mind. It'll pass in a moment if you stretch like this or like that. Then you realise it's not imaginary at all and you start thinking about your schedule for the next few days and reconciling it with your current physical state. Denial gives way to anger.</p> <p>'How could this happen to me now?' You bang your fist on the nearest object, causing pain now in your hand as well. After a few futile moments throwing toys from your pram, anger gives over to self-pity. You feel helpless and want to cry (like a child). Schedule-awareness then returns and you start making practical decisions. Have you got time to visit the osteopath? But the pain is growing sharper with every tiny movement and making fast-track shifts in your priorities. So you shuffle slowly and bent, tail between your legs, to the phone and beg emotionally for an urgent appointment.</p> <p>Either by eye and palpation or by X-ray as well, the osteopath ascertains it's not a disk problem, simply the sacrum (triangular bone at base of spine) sheering off on a rebellious angle, causing spasm in the muscles around the sacro-illiac (hip-bone) joints. Lying on the treatment couch now at the mercy of the gods, you surrender your body to a series of mind- and heart-stopping 'keklunks', get dressed, pay your money and hobble out, hopefully to full recovery within a couple of days.</p> <p>However, if you look back, you may notice this crisis did not just occur out of the blue. There were signs: perhaps stiff shoulders and niggling pains in the middle back, headaches, stomach, bowel or kidney pains the week before. Maybe you were under extreme pressure at work or confused and unhappy at home, or both. Perhaps you were worried about money. Almost for sure, you were doing too much for one person to reasonably handle at that time.</p> <p>It's hard to accept in this fast-moving, over-exciting world that you're not superhuman. Sometimes your inner-self, struggling to keep up with the pace, has to give you slow-down signals you can't ignore.</p> <p>If an acute back crisis should occur, osteopathy (or chiropractic) is perhaps the most effective way to set the bones back into proper alignment. Acupuncture or acupressure (shiatsu) can be helpful to release the muscular spasm. Normal massage tends to aggravate the condition when at its most acute and should really only be used once symptoms have settled and subsequently as a preventative. Take painkillers, if you feel the need - it's no crime to mix natural medicine with allopathic - the overall relaxing effect can help the healing process.</p> <p>Obviously, if you don't have complete faith in alternative practitioners to correctly diagnose the fault, do visit a GP and back specialist, but don't be too quick to agree to surgery. Instead, take the medical diagnosis to a competent or recommended osteopath or chiropractor, whose arts originally date back to the bone-setters of ancient India and China, and have them 'klunk' you back into shape the natural way.</p> <p>Above all, use the entire experience as an opportunity to examine how you could better restructure your life and agenda, however minimally, to make the adventure slightly easier for you from now on. You deserve that.</p> <p>Dear Barefoot Doctor, I am 37 and have been diagnosed with high blood pressure (140/90) for which no cause is obviously apparent. I am very alarmed by the prospect of long-term medication. Are there alternative measures I can take? <b> <br>Karen Lee, Peterborough</b></p> <p>Hi Karen, try testing for mineral deficiency with a view to taking magnesium supplements. A course of acupuncture would also be effective, starting with two sessions a week, gradually stretching out to once a week, once a fortnight, once a month and so on as the blood pressure stabilises. Reduce intake of fat and starch and avoid coffee, tea, alcohol and other stimulants as much as possible. Also massage the groove behind your ear for one minute every morning and night.</p> <p>Dear Barefoot, four months ago, at eight months pregnant, I suddenly developed a lot of 'floaters' in both eyes. Coincidentally, I had fallen and broken my foot a week before. I've been told by a specialist that there's 'no cure' and that I must learn to live with them. The constant disturbance to my vision is extremely draining and is severely affecting my quality of life. Is there anything you could suggest? <b> <br>Mrs Lucy Robertson, Cambridge</b></p> <p>Dear Lucy, during pregnancy the kidneys are required to work double time as, according to Oriental medicine, they are in charge of making sure the baby grows properly in utero. They are also responsible for the bones and joints. Breaking your foot would have shocked the kidneys and depleted their energy.</p> <p>The kidneys are also responsible for containing and regenerating your 'yin' or fluid energy, which if released suddenly through shock, can cause floaters. Take Schisandra (the Chinese herb) to boost the kidneys and consider a short course of cranio-sacral therapy and/or shiatsu to boost the kidneys, balance the system and release blockage from the occiput (the bit at the base of the skull where the neck muscles join). Within two or three weeks, your vision should be less obstructed.</p> <p>\u0095 Barefoot Doctor is author of Handbook for the Urban Warrior and teaches Taoism, meditation, Chinese medicine and t'ai chi. He has been in practice for more than 20 years, specialising in personal-crisis management.</p> <p>If you have any problems you'd like answers to, please write to Barefoot Doctor at Life magazine, The Observer, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER or email him on <a href=\"mailto:barefoot.doctor@observer.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">barefoot.doctor@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "I don't know if you've ever 'done your lower back in' - if not, I hope you never do, or if you have, may you never do so again. I'm not on about chronic backache - this is about the sudden variety, the skewed sacro-illiac joint affair, the kind that seems to come out of almost nowhere - perhaps bending over the sink, or even stretching before getting out of bed. The sort that has you walking completely lop-sided and bent over, emitting a series of grunts, groans and stifled screams as you valiantly attempt the sharply painful transition between one position and another. At first you go into denial. You didn't really make that movement. This pain isn't really there. It's all in the mind. It'll pass in a moment if you stretch like this or like that. Then you realise it's not imaginary at all and you start thinking about your schedule for the next few days and reconciling it with your current physical state. Denial gives way to anger. 'How could this happen to me now?' You bang your fist on the nearest object, causing pain now in your hand as well. After a few futile moments throwing toys from your pram, anger gives over to self-pity. You feel helpless and want to cry (like a child). Schedule-awareness then returns and you start making practical decisions. Have you got time to visit the osteopath? But the pain is growing sharper with every tiny movement and making fast-track shifts in your priorities. So you shuffle slowly and bent, tail between your legs, to the phone and beg emotionally for an urgent appointment. Either by eye and palpation or by X-ray as well, the osteopath ascertains it's not a disk problem, simply the sacrum (triangular bone at base of spine) sheering off on a rebellious angle, causing spasm in the muscles around the sacro-illiac (hip-bone) joints. Lying on the treatment couch now at the mercy of the gods, you surrender your body to a series of mind- and heart-stopping 'keklunks', get dressed, pay your money and hobble out, hopefully to full recovery within a couple of days. However, if you look back, you may notice this crisis did not just occur out of the blue. There were signs: perhaps stiff shoulders and niggling pains in the middle back, headaches, stomach, bowel or kidney pains the week before. Maybe you were under extreme pressure at work or confused and unhappy at home, or both. Perhaps you were worried about money. Almost for sure, you were doing too much for one person to reasonably handle at that time. It's hard to accept in this fast-moving, over-exciting world that you're not superhuman. Sometimes your inner-self, struggling to keep up with the pace, has to give you slow-down signals you can't ignore. If an acute back crisis should occur, osteopathy (or chiropractic) is perhaps the most effective way to set the bones back into proper alignment. Acupuncture or acupressure (shiatsu) can be helpful to release the muscular spasm. Normal massage tends to aggravate the condition when at its most acute and should really only be used once symptoms have settled and subsequently as a preventative. Take painkillers, if you feel the need - it's no crime to mix natural medicine with allopathic - the overall relaxing effect can help the healing process. Obviously, if you don't have complete faith in alternative practitioners to correctly diagnose the fault, do visit a GP and back specialist, but don't be too quick to agree to surgery. Instead, take the medical diagnosis to a competent or recommended osteopath or chiropractor, whose arts originally date back to the bone-setters of ancient India and China, and have them 'klunk' you back into shape the natural way. Above all, use the entire experience as an opportunity to examine how you could better restructure your life and agenda, however minimally, to make the adventure slightly easier for you from now on. You deserve that. Dear Barefoot Doctor, I am 37 and have been diagnosed with high blood pressure (140/90) for which no cause is obviously apparent. I am very alarmed by the prospect of long-term medication. Are there alternative measures I can take? Karen Lee, Peterborough Hi Karen, try testing for mineral deficiency with a view to taking magnesium supplements. A course of acupuncture would also be effective, starting with two sessions a week, gradually stretching out to once a week, once a fortnight, once a month and so on as the blood pressure stabilises. Reduce intake of fat and starch and avoid coffee, tea, alcohol and other stimulants as much as possible. Also massage the groove behind your ear for one minute every morning and night. Dear Barefoot, four months ago, at eight months pregnant, I suddenly developed a lot of 'floaters' in both eyes. Coincidentally, I had fallen and broken my foot a week before. I've been told by a specialist that there's 'no cure' and that I must learn to live with them. The constant disturbance to my vision is extremely draining and is severely affecting my quality of life. Is there anything you could suggest? Mrs Lucy Robertson, Cambridge Dear Lucy, during pregnancy the kidneys are required to work double time as, according to Oriental medicine, they are in charge of making sure the baby grows properly in utero. They are also responsible for the bones and joints. Breaking your foot would have shocked the kidneys and depleted their energy. The kidneys are also responsible for containing and regenerating your 'yin' or fluid energy, which if released suddenly through shock, can cause floaters. Take Schisandra (the Chinese herb) to boost the kidneys and consider a short course of cranio-sacral therapy and/or shiatsu to boost the kidneys, balance the system and release blockage from the occiput (the bit at the base of the skull where the neck muscles join). Within two or three weeks, your vision should be less obstructed. \u0095 Barefoot Doctor is author of Handbook for the Urban Warrior and teaches Taoism, meditation, Chinese medicine and t'ai chi. He has been in practice for more than 20 years, specialising in personal-crisis management.

      "body": "<p>I did OK! when my baby was born. My mother was a bit bemused - 'Which magazine have I got to go and buy again?' - but all my gay friends thought it was fabulously camp. The photographer arrived when my son, Griffin, was a week old. I was tempted to leave it a bit longer to allow for some of the tidal wave of water retention to subside. However, every pound off my thighs was another eye bag in night feeds so I reck oned I better hurry up and do it before I looked totally raddled. The high point of the shoot was when I was explaining what a marvellous baby Griffin was and he projectile vomited. Still, I take it as a mark of his innate style that he managed to miss both the photographer and my sofa.</p> <p>Hello! and OK! have got a celeb baby shoot conveyor belt going. No wonder - motherhood has never been more fashionable. Cherie, Posh, Iman, Catherine Zeta Jones, Emma Thompson, Meg Mathews, Patsy Kensit and Madonna have all given birth recently. Every week the celebrity magazines bring a fresh crop of oohs and aahs as born-again celebrity dads go misty-eyed over their freshly minted offspring. Beside them, shiny new celebrity mums lounge, their limbs arranged so as to conceal that tiny bit of cellulite they might be carrying in the nanosecond before the personal trainer or cosmetic surgeon has whisked it away. Got the pop carrier and pile in the country? Puke on one shoulder, as long as it's your baby's and not your own, is the next status symbol on the A-list shopping list.</p> <p>Still, if motherhood is de rigueur - Gucci is doing baby slings for the baby who has everything, including label-obsessed parents - the question is, what sort? Here are the varieties of ideal motherhood, available this season: 1) Selfless Stay-at-Home Mum. A bit frumpy. Glow of contentment. 2) Wicked Single Mum. A bit tarty. Glow of vodka Red Bull. 3) Thrusting Career Mum. A bit stressed out. Glow of laptop at three in the morning as she tries to catch up on work once baby is asleep. 4) Rock Chick Mum. A bit spaced-out. Glow of victory when she can get into size 6 Earl jeans half an hour after the birth. 5) Yoga Mum. A bit irritating due to burbling absolute rubbish while sipping wheat grass. Glow of inner peace.</p> <p>The bad news is that the kind of mum we're all supposed to be aiming for now is none of the above and yet all of them at the same time. She is the e-mother, the 'e' standing for everything, which is what she manages to do. A sort of post-millennium earth mother, the e-mother combines the simple homely (in the best sense of the word) sexiness of Nigella Lawson, forever whipping up delicious and nutritious meals for her children, with the ferocious ambition of Nicola Horlick. She is glamorous like Joely Richardson, but grounded like Emma Thompson. She may work, but not so that it interferes with breast-feeding, the school run and/or trips to the gym. She still manages to earn a good salary and does so without having a nanny. Oh yes, and she has a very flat stomach.</p> <p>Daisy Goodwin is a highly successful TV executive with Talkback Productions who has just had her second child. She is an expert at juggling career and motherhood, but even she finds the new e-mother a bit daunting. 'You're supposed to be cooking fashionable meals while wearing a cardi trimmed with ribbon and kitten heels and wearing a lot of make-up, but not too much,' she says. 'You have to earn loads of money, but also produce very bright children who are also very secure.' The flat stomach thing is especially irksome. 'Madonna is a nightmare,' says Goodwin. 'She had a Caesarean two weeks before me. I saw a picture of her coming out of hospital looking terrible and I was relieved. Now there's another picture of her and her tummy is a lot flatter than mine's going to be in a decade. I thought, \"Bloody hell.\"'</p> <p>Kim Blake runs her own fashion PR company. 'You're meant to be all-singing, all-dancing Patsy Kensit back in shape in six weeks,' she sighs. 'You've got to be an earth mother, company director and Mrs Walton all rolled into one. Sometimes you feel like you're compromising on everything.' If this sounds eerily similar to the moan of the 80s Having-It-All Superwomen, then there is a twist. The e-mother has to tightrope-walk without a net. She isn't allowed a nanny. She must demonstrate her commitment to the maternal role by looking after her children herself, while doing everything else as well.</p> <p>Maxine Drane has been a nanny for 11 years. She says, 'There has definitely been a drop off of work over the past couple of years. More women are working from home and just want help a couple of days a week.' Drane dreads the e-mother who has an office at home. 'I can't just get on with things,' she says. Either through guilt at not giving her little darlings her own full-time attention, or because she doesn't trust the nanny to perform the task to her impossibly high standards - she might slip a non-organic Penguin biscuit in to little Tarquin's lunchbox! - the e-mother is forever popping out of her office and getting in the nanny's hair.</p> <p>The e-mother orthodoxy holds that it is cruel and heartless to hand your baby to someone else. Real mothers - proper moth ers - change their own offspring's nappies. I remember an early visit from the health visitor. As she was leaving, she informed me she would be round in a few days time. I said that wasn't convenient, as I would be working. 'Who's going to look after the baby!' she exclaimed. I was tempted to say I was going to leave him on his own with a chainsaw, but I didn't think she had a sense of humour.</p> <p>'I felt totally alienated. I went to one National Childbirth Trust class and I could have been in a different dimension,' remembers Kim Blake. 'Everyone else who was having a baby was going from fourth gear to neutral. I went from fourth to third. I don't know if that was a good idea or not, but financially and emotionally I needed to go back to work.' This is the reality for many women and yet it is totally at odds with the e-mother philosophy. If the 80s was the decade of the power-dressed female executive wheeling a fax machine into the delivery room, then the Zeros are producing an equally unrealistic stereotype. The e-mother making organic biscuits with her kids with one hand, while firing off a few e-mails to her dotcom business with the other.</p> <p>There is something faintly 80s about having a Norland in full rig following along a few steps behind you, pushing a huge Mamas and Papas pram, but is the other option really workable? Elle McPherson famously doesn't have a nanny. However, when she took two-year-old Flynn to the set of Friends , she collapsed from exhaustion. As for Posh, she may not have a nanny, but she's got her mum and David, of course. To do without childcare you need a really good back-up. Step forward grandma. With many people retiring younger and being in better health for longer, the role of grandparents as unpaid childcarers is now key. Melanie Blatt of All Saints takes her mum with her to recording sessions to look after her child.</p> <p>Part of everyone else's nanny phobia is the Louise Woodward effect. We'd rather struggle ourselves than risk the childcare version of the cowboy builder. But it's more than that. The increasing numbers of women who now have babies later means they want to spend time with them. The number of women aged 35 and above who give birth has increased by 65 per cent over the past 10 years, while the numbers aged 29 and under has fallen steadily.</p> <p>I started off saying I didn't want a nanny. Then I returned from the parallel universe I was living in and realised I needed help. I then decided that I would get temporary nannies when I needed them, all highly trained, of course. I booked my highly trained help for a couple of days. She let me down the night before. My mother was away, my partner's mother is many miles away. In the words of Ghostbusters : 'Who you gonna call?' In my case, it was Mercedes, my Ecuadorian cleaner who's turned out to be a bit of a diamond. Frankly, though, if the paper boy would stand still long enough I'd probably be handing Griffin to him by now. I tell people I'm bringing up my child to be bilingual. The truth is Mercedes doesn't speak a lot of English.</p> <p>TV presenter Ulrika Jonsson managed without a nanny for a year when her son Cameron, now five, was born. 'I was totally happy to dedicate myself to the baby. I immersed myself, I didn't worry about my waistline or the stretchmarks on my bosoms.' Nine months later she went back to work. 'When I went away to work on Gladiators I discovered a new-found freedom that I had had before I was pregnant. That was the beginning of the revolution. It was like breaking out of a shell,' she explains. Ulrika is now pregnant again. This time she will have help. 'It's a bit pretentious to say you're not going to have a nanny. A bit earth mother,' she says. 'This time around there won't be the same independence as was possible with one child.'</p> <p>The rise in infertility is another factor in the e-mother's desire to Do It All Herself. Having children is now seen as a privilege. One in six couples now has problems conceiving. My partner and I had a slight hitch. I had to take fertility drugs and have an operation, although, by a fluke, I subsequently became pregnant naturally. For Jonsson, too, while having her son Cameron with her now ex-husband, cameraman John Turnbull, was relatively easy, conceiving with her new partner, now also ex, travel executive Marcus Kempen, wasn't as easy. 'I fell pregnant the first time we didn't use anything with Cameron. This time we didn't use anything for over a year and nothing. I thought, \"Oh, I've been drinking and having too much of a good time and I've made myself infertile.\" The doctor said wait for 18 months. But I didn't want to wait. I wanted a baby now.'</p> <p>For e-mothers, children are so precious, they must be cherished, adored and stimulated 24 hours a day. 'With Cameron, I used to take a shower and put him in the rock-a-by car seat next to me and I'd be singing to him in the shower.' Kim Blake can top that. 'People said I shouldn't bring my daughter in with me at night, so I slept on a camp bed next to the cot for the first six months. I was totally exhausted,' she admits. Neither, however, is as driven as the woman I saw in the park the other day. She had flash cards all round her baby's head in the pram.</p> <p>I recently encountered a room full of e-mothers at my local antenatal clinic. I casually mentioned that I'd left Griffin at home when he was six weeks old while I went away to work for six days. The Joseph Tricot-euses passed judgment. 'I miss my baby even if I leave her with my husband so I can go to the supermarket,' said one, shrill with horror at my heartlessness. Another was stunned by my apparent lack of maternal instinct. 'She screams if either of us leave the room!' she said of her own baby.</p> <p>It wasn't always like this. As Aminata Forna describes in her book Mother of All Myths in the 18th century, 'Babies were wrapped tightly in swaddling clothes and often hung up on a peg'. Maybe Elle should have tried that? Today, however, we live in an increasingly child-centred world. As we become more cynical about adult human nature, so we imbue infants with a saintly fragility. Every degree we fall out of love with ourselves is one more degree to fall in love with our children. We don't so much change nappies now as pay homage.</p> <p>Step one in e-mother baby worship is breast-feeding. At the same antenatal clinic where I was virtually stoned for not having Griffin strapped to me 24 hours-a-day, I committed another e-mother cardinal sin. I pulled a bottle of formula out of my handbag. Now, I did give breast-feeding a go. However, it was like the storming of the Normandy beaches. It took me, my maternity nurse, my other half and baby, plus nipple guards and KY jelly and it still didn't work. I could have persevered, but since I'd acquired a comedy cleavage - 36H - I wimped out.</p> <p>We all know that breast-feeding is best for the baby, but there is also a lot of guff talked about it. Even if you are better at it than I was, the truth is it's a full-time job in itself. You are chained to the sofa. Yes, you can express milk, but that takes time, too. I wonder how many of the celeb e-mothers who seem to glide seamlessly from The Portland to the Met Bar are actually breast- feeding? Certainly, their reed-like figures suggest they're not. The other great lie about breast-feeding is how much weight it will help you shift. Breast-feeding does help contract the uterus, flattening your stomach, and it burns 500 calories a day. That said, you will be absolutely ravenous, so capable of clearing the fridge at one sitting, and have a chest area that looks as if someone took a foot pump to it.</p> <p>The cult of self-sacrifice is key to all ideals of motherhood. In parts of Asia, Africa and South America, a motherhood cult known as Marianisma (after the Virgin Mary) decrees huge sacrifices on the part of poverty-stricken mothers in favour of their children. We have our own version of that same cult here, of course. Single mothers on benefits, who shuffle to the shops in their slippers to buy expensive Tommy Hilfiger tops for their kids. Only we don't worship those mothers. We force them out to work.</p> <p>'Once a mother fed, clothed and comforted her offspring and there, for better or worse, lay the limits of her obligations,' writes Amanita Forna. 'Today her responsi bilities have doubled. She is also in charge of her children's emotional stability and psychological development_ Successful motherhood now means producing a high- achiever as well as a well-balanced adult.'</p> <p>What about the role of the father in all of this? E-mothers have perfectly supportive partners. In real life, things aren't always so smooth. As Ulrika Jonsson says ruefully of her relationship with the father of her unborn child, 'I went in wanting to have a baby with this person and I didn't know it would be a disaster. I didn't just search out this sperm'.</p> <p>If your relationship does survive the pregnancy, the period after you give birth can be traumatic. The most modern and equal of relationships begin to revert to a more traditional pattern, especially if you're breast-feeding. Michael Douglas tells Hello! that he is 'the official burper', but the bulk of the hard labour is still Catherine's. Extended families who may have been but a distant presence also suddenly become part of your life, bringing with them different expectations of how your relationship should be.</p> <p>How many other mothers on reading the rumours surrounding the break-up of Meg Mathews and Noel Gallagher's marriage - Meg is said to have been discovered wandering naked in the garden of her \u00a32m Bucks mansion 'out of it' - felt a pang of sympathy? No one advocates drug use while in charge of small children. However, here was a woman who'd been used to spending entire afternoons handbag shopping. Suddenly it was her stomach that had gone baggy and she had a bawling baby to boot. Meg managed to hold off going to parties until Ana\u00efs was 10 weeks old. She left her first post-baby bash after just 40 minutes.</p> <p>'I want to go home to my baby,' she said at the time. 'I love parties, but at the moment they're not my thing.' Unfortunately, it seems she changed her mind. Meg is said to have checked in for help with depression at The Priory. Noel is also said to be having psychotherapy. At least Meg looked the part, able to wear a see-through top within weeks of giving birth. Appearance is vital to the e-mother. Ulrika Jonsson says of her second pregnancy, 'This time around there is much more pressure to be sexy. I'm 5kg up on what I was last time. If you've got big knockers you don't see your tummy or your feet. I had this dream of being a trendy mum and look like a sort of hippy Madonna, but it hasn't really come to fruition.' And as for Posh, 'She makes me feel bad. She makes me feel fat,' she reveals. If Mrs Beckham makes Ulrika feel fat, what hope for the rest of us?</p> <p>Jonsson demonstrates one of the ironies about the e-mother. While it is essential that you look sexy, preferably having slipped back into your hipster jeans after the birth, it is equally vital that you don't behave in too sexy a way. Jonsson was castigated for posing for a set of risqu\u00e9 fashion pictures after the birth of her son.</p> <p>'I really don't feel that just because you give birth we have to stop living and enjoying other sides of things,' she says. 'You can be a mother and be sexy, too.' She's right, of course. Women such as Carol Smilie who regain their shape after birth are congratulated for it. Still, the reaction to women who are then seen out on the town having a good time is less positive.</p> <p>'When I had Cameron, I suddenly discovered going out, because in a confusing way I was a mother and single again. I didn't go out a lot. Maybe one night a week. But maybe I'd been out and I was drunk and I was heavily criticised,' she remembers. One newspaper bracketed her with Fergie as the worst mothers in Britain. It's an accusation that still hurts. 'What makes you a bad mother is behaving irresponsibly when you're with your children. If you're getting pissed or throwing up in front of your five-year-old that is a different thing,' says Jonsson.</p> <p>In the past, for women, marriage was not preceded by a long period of singledom. However, today's e-mother may be yesterday's Ladette. Step forward Zo\u00eb Ball. It will be interesting to see how Zo\u00eb cuts it as an e-mother. Her baby is due on Christmas Eve. She is definitely giving it her best shot. Ball famously gave up her job so she could be in the correct de-stressed state to conceive. The fact her husband is a millionaire might have eased that decision. Even so, conception didn't happen as planned. She spent a good few months playing Wife instead of Mother. 'I made every dish in Jamie Oliver's cookbook,' she recently revealed.</p> <p>Food is key for the e-mother. Once breast- feeding is finished (and it can go on for years) only organic food will do. I know one mother who allows her child to go to McDonald's with her friends, but insists she takes her well-balanced organic meal with her in little Tupperware containers. While the other children tuck into fries, this child eats broccoli. I thought I'd done OK with this bit of e-motherdom, having purchased organic baby rice for Griffin. I told my health visitor proudly. She just gave me a look and suggested I try some fresh food.</p> <p>Kate Winslett, whose baby is due this week, is obviously well on her way to e-motherdom. She will take six months off after the birth - gold star to Kate - to live The Good Life with her hubby. On the subject of the birth, Kate has been quoted as saying she wants no drugs. 'If I need help during labour we'll ring my acupuncturist.' I laughed so much when I read that that I almost ruptured a stretchmark.</p> <p>So there we have it, the world according to e-motherdom. And what a lovely, rose-tinted fantasy it is. The idea that any baby will 'be packed in the bags and he'll be on the road' - as Catherine Zeta Jones says of her son in Hello! - is ludicrous. Babies are a huge disruption, hopefully a nice one, to your life and to your relationship. Zo\u00eb Ball reveals: 'I was saying I wanted to be at home - I've sort of turned into my mother.'</p> <p>That was before she got pregnant. Wait till she's had the baby. A couple of months of night feeds and she'll feel like her mum and look like her grandma.</p> <p><b>Baby talk</b></p> <p>'This has to be the the happiest time in my life. Alexandria is the force around whom everyone is gathered. My soul feels complete.' <b><br> Iman </b></p> <p>'No one can prepare you for that moment of seeing him for the first time. Just before Dylan was born I turned to Michael and said, \"I'd do this again.\"' <b><br> Catherine Zeta Jones </b></p> <p>'I can't stand the thought of our baby being delivered by someone I don't know. I've had a good training for labour with some of my film roles, especially Titanic, when I was immersed for days in freezing tanks of water. I want a drug-free birth - it's what women are designed to do and we should bloody well get on with it.'<b><br> Kate Winslet </b></p> <p>'Everyone is talking about babies. I want one. It's definitely getting to the stage where I want another baby.' <b><br> Victoria Beckham </b></p> <p>'Motherhood has had a huge impact on me. When you have children you have to step outside yourself. You look at life from a different perspective.'<b><br> Madonna </b></p>",

She still manages to earn a good salary and does so without having a nanny. Oh yes, and she has a very flat stomach. Daisy Goodwin is a highly successful TV executive with Talkback Productions who has just had her second child. She is an expert at juggling career and motherhood, but even she finds the new e-mother a bit daunting. 'You're supposed to be cooking fashionable meals while wearing a cardi trimmed with ribbon and kitten heels and wearing a lot of make-up, but not too much,' she says. 'You have to earn loads of money, but also produce very bright children who are also very secure.' The flat stomach thing is especially irksome. 'Madonna is a nightmare,' says Goodwin. 'She had a Caesarean two weeks before me. I saw a picture of her coming out of hospital looking terrible and I was relieved. Now there's another picture of her and her tummy is a lot flatter than mine's going to be in a decade. I thought, \"Bloody hell.\"' Kim Blake runs her own fashion PR company. 'You're meant to be all-singing, all-dancing Patsy Kensit back in shape in six weeks,' she sighs. 'You've got to be an earth mother, company director and Mrs Walton all rolled into one. Sometimes you feel like you're compromising on everything.' If this sounds eerily similar to the moan of the 80s Having-It-All Superwomen, then there is a twist. The e-mother has to tightrope-walk without a net. She isn't allowed a nanny. She must demonstrate her commitment to the maternal role by looking after her children herself, while doing everything else as well. Maxine Drane has been a nanny for 11 years. She says, 'There has definitely been a drop off of work over the past couple of years. More women are working from home and just want help a couple of days a week.' Drane dreads the e-mother who has an office at home. 'I can't just get on with things,' she says. Either through guilt at not giving her little darlings her own full-time attention, or because she doesn't trust the nanny to perform the task to her impossibly high standards - she might slip a non-organic Penguin biscuit in to little Tarquin's lunchbox! - the e-mother is forever popping out of her office and getting in the nanny's hair. The e-mother orthodoxy holds that it is cruel and heartless to hand your baby to someone else. Real mothers - proper moth ers - change their own offspring's nappies. I remember an early visit from the health visitor. As she was leaving, she informed me she would be round in a few days time. I said that wasn't convenient, as I would be working. 'Who's going to look after the baby!' she exclaimed. I was tempted to say I was going to leave him on his own with a chainsaw, but I didn't think she had a sense of humour. 'I felt totally alienated. I went to one National Childbirth Trust class and I could have been in a different dimension,' remembers Kim Blake. 'Everyone else who was having a baby was going from fourth gear to neutral. I went from fourth to third. I don't know if that was a good idea or not, but financially and emotionally I needed to go back to work.' This is the reality for many women and yet it is totally at odds with the e-mother philosophy. If the 80s was the decade of the power-dressed female executive wheeling a fax machine into the delivery room, then the Zeros are producing an equally unrealistic stereotype. The e-mother making organic biscuits with her kids with one hand, while firing off a few e-mails to her dotcom business with the other. There is something faintly 80s about having a Norland in full rig following along a few steps behind you, pushing a huge Mamas and Papas pram, but is the other option really workable? Elle McPherson famously doesn't have a nanny. However, when she took two-year-old Flynn to the set of Friends , she collapsed from exhaustion. As for Posh, she may not have a nanny, but she's got her mum and David, of course. To do without childcare you need a really good back-up. Step forward grandma. With many people retiring younger and being in better health for longer, the role of grandparents as unpaid childcarers is now key. Melanie Blatt of All Saints takes her mum with her to recording sessions to look after her child. Part of everyone else's nanny phobia is the Louise Woodward effect. We'd rather struggle ourselves than risk the childcare version of the cowboy builder. But it's more than that. The increasing numbers of women who now have babies later means they want to spend time with them. The number of women aged 35 and above who give birth has increased by 65 per cent over the past 10 years, while the numbers aged 29 and under has fallen steadily. I started off saying I didn't want a nanny. Then I returned from the parallel universe I was living in and realised I needed help. I then decided that I would get temporary nannies when I needed them, all highly trained, of course. I booked my highly trained help for a couple of days. She let me down the night before. My mother was away, my partner's mother is many miles away. In the words of Ghostbusters : 'Who you gonna call?' In my case, it was Mercedes, my Ecuadorian cleaner who's turned out to be a bit of a diamond. Frankly, though, if the paper boy would stand still long enough I'd probably be handing Griffin to him by now. I tell people I'm bringing up my child to be bilingual. The truth is Mercedes doesn't speak a lot of English. TV presenter Ulrika Jonsson managed without a nanny for a year when her son Cameron, now five, was born. 'I was totally happy to dedicate myself to the baby. I immersed myself, I didn't worry about my waistline or the stretchmarks on my bosoms.' Nine months later she went back to work. 'When I went away to work on Gladiators I discovered a new-found freedom that I had had before I was pregnant. That was the beginning of the revolution. It was like breaking out of a shell,' she explains. Ulrika is now pregnant again. This time she will have help. 'It's a bit pretentious to say you're not going to have a nanny. A bit earth mother,' she says. 'This time around there won't be the same independence as was possible with one child.' The rise in infertility is another factor in the e-mother's desire to Do It All Herself. Having children is now seen as a privilege. One in six couples now has problems conceiving. My partner and I had a slight hitch. I had to take fertility drugs and have an operation, although, by a fluke, I subsequently became pregnant naturally. For Jonsson, too, while having her son Cameron with her now ex-husband, cameraman John Turnbull, was relatively easy, conceiving with her new partner, now also ex, travel executive Marcus Kempen, wasn't as easy. 'I fell pregnant the first time we didn't use anything with Cameron. This time we didn't use anything for over a year and nothing. I thought, \"Oh, I've been drinking and having too much of a good time and I've made myself infertile.\" The doctor said wait for 18 months. But I didn't want to wait. I wanted a baby now.' For e-mothers, children are so precious, they must be cherished, adored and stimulated 24 hours a day. 'With Cameron, I used to take a shower and put him in the rock-a-by car seat next to me and I'd be singing to him in the shower.' Kim Blake can top that. 'People said I shouldn't bring my daughter in with me at night, so I slept on a camp bed next to the cot for the first six months. I was totally exhausted,' she admits. Neither, however, is as driven as the woman I saw in the park the other day. She had flash cards all round her baby's head in the pram. I recently encountered a room full of e-mothers at my local antenatal clinic. I casually mentioned that I'd left Griffin at home when he was six weeks old while I went away to work for six days. The Joseph Tricot-euses passed judgment. 'I miss my baby even if I leave her with my husband so I can go to the supermarket,' said one, shrill with horror at my heartlessness. Another was stunned by my apparent lack of maternal instinct. 'She screams if either of us leave the room!' she said of her own baby. It wasn't always like this. As Aminata Forna describes in her book Mother of All Myths in the 18th century, 'Babies were wrapped tightly in swaddling clothes and often hung up on a peg'. Maybe Elle should have tried that? Today, however, we live in an increasingly child-centred world. As we become more cynical about adult human nature, so we imbue infants with a saintly fragility. Every degree we fall out of love with ourselves is one more degree to fall in love with our children. We don't so much change nappies now as pay homage. Step one in e-mother baby worship is breast-feeding. At the same antenatal clinic where I was virtually stoned for not having Griffin strapped to me 24 hours-a-day, I committed another e-mother cardinal sin. I pulled a bottle of formula out of my handbag. Now, I did give breast-feeding a go. However, it was like the storming of the Normandy beaches. It took me, my maternity nurse, my other half and baby, plus nipple guards and KY jelly and it still didn't work. I could have persevered, but since I'd acquired a comedy cleavage - 36H - I wimped out. We all know that breast-feeding is best for the baby, but there is also a lot of guff talked about it. Even if you are better at it than I was, the truth is it's a full-time job in itself. You are chained to the sofa. Yes, you can express milk, but that takes time, too. I wonder how many of the celeb e-mothers who seem to glide seamlessly from The Portland to the Met Bar are actually breast- feeding? Certainly, their reed-like figures suggest they're not. The other great lie about breast-feeding is how much weight it will help you shift. Breast-feeding does help contract the uterus, flattening your stomach, and it burns 500 calories a day. That said, you will be absolutely ravenous, so capable of clearing the fridge at one sitting, and have a chest area that looks as if someone took a foot pump to it. The cult of self-sacrifice is key to all ideals of motherhood. In parts of Asia, Africa and South America, a motherhood cult known as Marianisma (after the Virgin Mary) decrees huge sacrifices on the part of poverty-stricken mothers in favour of their children. We have our own version of that same cult here, of course. Single mothers on benefits, who shuffle to the shops in their slippers to buy expensive Tommy Hilfiger tops for their kids. Only we don't worship those mothers. We force them out to work. 'Once a mother fed, clothed and comforted her offspring and there, for better or worse, lay the limits of her obligations,' writes Amanita Forna. 'Today her responsi bilities have doubled. She is also in charge of her children's emotional stability and psychological development_ Successful motherhood now means producing a high- achiever as well as a well-balanced adult.' What about the role of the father in all of this? E-mothers have perfectly supportive partners. In real life, things aren't always so smooth. As Ulrika Jonsson says ruefully of her relationship with the father of her unborn child, 'I went in wanting to have a baby with this person and I didn't know it would be a disaster. I didn't just search out this sperm'. If your relationship does survive the pregnancy, the period after you give birth can be traumatic. The most modern and equal of relationships begin to revert to a more traditional pattern, especially if you're breast-feeding. Michael Douglas tells Hello! that he is 'the official burper', but the bulk of the hard labour is still Catherine's. Extended families who may have been but a distant presence also suddenly become part of your life, bringing with them different expectations of how your relationship should be. How many other mothers on reading the rumours surrounding the break-up of Meg Mathews and Noel Gallagher's marriage - Meg is said to have been discovered wandering naked in the garden of her \u00a32m Bucks mansion 'out of it' - felt a pang of sympathy? No one advocates drug use while in charge of small children. However, here was a woman who'd been used to spending entire afternoons handbag shopping. Suddenly it was her stomach that had gone baggy and she had a bawling baby to boot. Meg managed to hold off going to parties until Ana\u00efs was 10 weeks old. She left her first post-baby bash after just 40 minutes. 'I want to go home to my baby,' she said at the time. 'I love parties, but at the moment they're not my thing.' Unfortunately, it seems she changed her mind. Meg is said to have checked in for help with depression at The Priory. Noel is also said to be having psychotherapy. At least Meg looked the part, able to wear a see-through top within weeks of giving birth. Appearance is vital to the e-mother. Ulrika Jonsson says of her second pregnancy, 'This time around there is much more pressure to be sexy. I'm 5kg up on what I was last time. If you've got big knockers you don't see your tummy or your feet. I had this dream of being a trendy mum and look like a sort of hippy Madonna, but it hasn't really come to fruition.' And as for Posh, 'She makes me feel bad. She makes me feel fat,' she reveals. If Mrs Beckham makes Ulrika feel fat, what hope for the rest of us? Jonsson demonstrates one of the ironies about the e-mother. While it is essential that you look sexy, preferably having slipped back into your hipster jeans after the birth, it is equally vital that you don't behave in too sexy a way. Jonsson was castigated for posing for a set of risqu\u00e9 fashion pictures after the birth of her son. 'I really don't feel that just because you give birth we have to stop living and enjoying other sides of things,' she says. 'You can be a mother and be sexy, too.' She's right, of course. Women such as Carol Smilie who regain their shape after birth are congratulated for it. Still, the reaction to women who are then seen out on the town having a good time is less positive. 'When I had Cameron, I suddenly discovered going out, because in a confusing way I was a mother and single again. I didn't go out a lot. Maybe one night a week. But maybe I'd been out and I was drunk and I was heavily criticised,' she remembers. One newspaper bracketed her with Fergie as the worst mothers in Britain. It's an accusation that still hurts. 'What makes you a bad mother is behaving irresponsibly when you're with your children. If you're getting pissed or throwing up in front of your five-year-old that is a different thing,' says Jonsson. In the past, for women, marriage was not preceded by a long period of singledom. However, today's e-mother may be yesterday's Ladette. Step forward Zo\u00eb Ball. It will be interesting to see how Zo\u00eb cuts it as an e-mother. Her baby is due on Christmas Eve. She is definitely giving it her best shot. Ball famously gave up her job so she could be in the correct de-stressed state to conceive. The fact her husband is a millionaire might have eased that decision. Even so, conception didn't happen as planned. She spent a good few months playing Wife instead of Mother. 'I made every dish in Jamie Oliver's cookbook,' she recently revealed. Food is key for the e-mother. Once breast- feeding is finished (and it can go on for years) only organic food will do. I know one mother who allows her child to go to McDonald's with her friends, but insists she takes her well-balanced organic meal with her in little Tupperware containers. While the other children tuck into fries, this child eats broccoli. I thought I'd done OK with this bit of e-motherdom, having purchased organic baby rice for Griffin. I told my health visitor proudly. She just gave me a look and suggested I try some fresh food. Kate Winslett, whose baby is due this week, is obviously well on her way to e-motherdom. She will take six months off after the birth - gold star to Kate - to live The Good Life with her hubby. On the subject of the birth, Kate has been quoted as saying she wants no drugs. 'If I need help during labour we'll ring my acupuncturist.' I laughed so much when I read that that I almost ruptured a stretchmark. So there we have it, the world according to e-motherdom. And what a lovely, rose-tinted fantasy it is. The idea that any baby will 'be packed in the bags and he'll be on the road' - as Catherine Zeta Jones says of her son in Hello! - is ludicrous. Babies are a huge disruption, hopefully a nice one, to your life and to your relationship. Zo\u00eb Ball reveals: 'I was saying I wanted to be at home - I've sort of turned into my mother.' That was before she got pregnant. Wait till she's had the baby. A couple of months of night feeds and she'll feel like her mum and look like her grandma. Baby talk 'This has to be the the happiest time in my life. Alexandria is the force around whom everyone is gathered. My soul feels complete.' Iman 'No one can prepare you for that moment of seeing him for the first time. Just before Dylan was born I turned to Michael and said, \"I'd do this again.\"' Catherine Zeta Jones 'I can't stand the thought of our baby being delivered by someone I don't know. I've had a good training for labour with some of my film roles, especially Titanic, when I was immersed for days in freezing tanks of water. I want a drug-free birth - it's what women are designed to do and we should bloody well get on with it.' Kate Winslet 'Everyone is talking about babies. I want one. It's definitely getting to the stage where I want another baby.' Victoria Beckham 'Motherhood has had a huge impact on me. When you have children you have to step outside yourself. You look at life from a different perspective.' Madonna",

      "body": "<p>The drug deal was going horribly wrong. Instead of coming away with \u00a310,000 worth of premium quality crack cocaine, Martin Maynard and his friend Philip Etienne had been ambushed by a team of armed Yardie gangsters who were trying to steal their money.</p> <p>Martin had lost count of how many shots had been fired. One had been so close he had felt its heat as it whistled past his ear. He had somehow fought his way out of the car and made a desperate run for a nearby low wall. It was only when he reached it that he risked a glance behind him.</p> <p>'I was shaking with fear. I looked back and saw Philip staggering round the rear of the Mondeo. He was limping, obviously in pain, and as he passed under a streetlight I could see his right leg was soaked dark with blood. One of the gunmen was standing right in front of him, about eight feet away, and his gun was aimed directly at Philip's chest. I heard him shouting: 'D'ya want another one, bumba clot? D'ya want it again?'</p> <p>'I was thinking, \"Oh Jesus, he's going to shoot Philip. He's going to fucking kill Philip\". In that fraction of a second, I had to make a decision that I would have to live with for the rest of my life. To my right was the safety of the main road. The gunman hadn't seen me, I wasn't injured, I could easily make it across. On my left was Philip, moments away from being shot dead in cold blood. It was the hardest, most agonising decision I have ever had to make. And there was just no time for it. I took one last glance at the main road, sucked in a deep breath, turned towards the gunman and started running.' </p> <p>It was the end both men had long feared. For the previous eight years, Philip and Martin had lived among the upper echelons of London's criminal underworld. During that time, they dealt in guns, stolen high-performance cars, stolen passports and traded vast quantities of cocaine, ecstasy and crack. With their plush Docklands flats, brand new BMWs and bulging wallets, they made a mockery of the notion that crime doesn't pay.</p> <p>Able to lay their hands on vast amounts of cash at a moment's notice, and with a sizable group of dedicated henchmen at their beck and call, the pair were just the kind of high-ranking professional villains that other crooks felt most comfortable dealing with. Which was just the idea. Because, in reality, Philip and Martin were undercover police officers working for Scotland Yard's most elite unit: SO10.</p> <p>Also known as the Crime Operations Group, SO10 (the first two letters stand for Specialist Operations) is one of the most secretive divisions within the whole of the police force. Even Special Branch (SO12), which works hand in hand with MI5, is relatively open about the nature of its work. In contrast, all of the books, brochures and information packs produced by the Metropolitan Police - even their own website - fail to mention SO10 at all.</p> <p>The reality of working undercover is a world away from anything that has ever been portrayed in film or on television. It is something the vast majority of police officers are totally unprepared for. </p> <p>'Working in uniform or even moving into CID, you spend your time chasing after kids nicking cars or blokes with 50 quid's worth of dope in their back pockets,' says Martin. 'You never meet a real criminal. They're the people who always have a couple of grand in their wallet. They have the car of their dreams parked outside the house of their dreams. They eat in the best restaurants and get into the best clubs without ever having to queue up. When you work undercover, you have to become just like them.'</p> <p>Part of the challenge is working alone. Although there might be surveillance and back-up in place at the beginning of a job, officers are totally alone thereafter. With no radio or warrant card, they can neither call in help or prove who they are. And it is often only at the last minute that they will find out where a deal is to take place.</p> <p>'Not only do you not know where you are going, but you also know surprisingly little about your target,' adds Philip. 'It sounds crazy but it's standard SO10 procedure that you don't delve into the background of the people you are after. The reason is clear: the more you know about someone, the more you'll end up thinking about it, even if it's only at the back of your mind. If you've been told that the man you are sitting with always keeps a pistol down the side of his boot, you're going to jump through the roof when he gets a sudden itch on his calf and reaches down to scratch it. The only way to be relaxed is to not know.</p> <p>It's a similar problem when it comes to identifying people. Sometimes you get given pictures so you can make sure you have got the right person, but then when you walk into a pub for the first time to meet them, you have to remember that you're not supposed to know what they look like. You can't be seen to recognise them.'</p> <p>For those who get past the initial assessment, the only way to qualify to work for SO10 is to go through what is widely considered to be the most difficult and demanding training course the police force has to offer. Based at the Peel Centre in Hendon, North London, the same place where the Met puts its raw recruits through their paces, the course starts at 7am on a Monday and runs straight through until 4am the following morning. If they're lucky, students manage to grab a couple of hours' sleep before starting again at 7am on Tuesday. And so it goes on, day after day, night after night, for two solid weeks.</p> <p>During that time, there are lectures about points of law, constant exams, assessments and exercises. There are detailed role-playing sessions where recruits learn to deal with every conceivable situation, as well as hands-on instruction in the use of hidden tape recorders, transmitters and technical equipment. They are taught about dealing with informants, reading body language, how to dress, how to act, how to speak while they are undercover. Most of all, they learn how to keep out of trouble - physical and legal.</p> <p>Gathering evidence while undercover is fraught with difficulty. Critical conversations can be recorded with special devices, but a whole new set of skills needs to be learned in order to get the best from them. Under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act, a police officer can only interview someone if they have first read them their rights. If they haven't done that, then any evidence obtained, no matter how damning, becomes inadmissible in a court of law.</p> <p>So if an officer is recording a target who begins to implicate themselves in a crime but then stops halfway through, the undercover can't ask them for more information. If they start firing questions, defence lawyers will argue that it constitutes an interview and the case will be thrown out.</p> <p>The most notorious example of this came a few years ago when 39-year-old mother-of-two Patricia Hall, vanished from her home in Pudsey, Leeds, on a freezing January night. Though hundreds of people disappear each year hoping to leave their troubles behind and start over, they almost always leave some kind of trail, take a bunch of personal items or stockpile cash to sustain them. Patricia had done none of these things - she hadn't even taken any warm clothing.</p> <p>Detectives investigating the case quickly discovered that, shortly before she vanished, Patricia allegedly told her husband, Keith, that she was going to leave him for another man, sparking a series of furious arguments. Keith, who insisted that Patricia had simply walked out on him after one particularly nasty row, became the prime suspect in his wife's murder, but not a scrap of evidence could be found to prove he was responsible or even that she was dead.</p> <p>Six months on, Keith placed an advert in the lonely hearts column of his local newspaper and an undercover officer known as Claire was brought in to respond.</p> <p>The relationship quickly flourished, and after a few months Keith proposed marriage. Claire told him she was terrified of Patricia coming back into his life, that the only way she could go forward with the relationship would be to know the absolute truth about what happened. Sitting in Claire's car, which had been fitted with microphones and recording devices, Keith said nothing for a while then whispered: 'It's okay, she's dead.'</p> <p>'How do you know?' asked Claire.</p> <p>'How do you think I know? I was sleeping downstairs, then I woke up. I strangled her. There was a voice in my head telling me to do it.' Later that same night, Keith explained that he had burned the body and that the police would never find it. He was arrested and charged with murder three days later.</p> <p>At trial, the judge, Mr Justice Waterhouse, ruled the recordings - the only real evidence against him - could not be heard because they breached the code of practice governing interview procedures. 'However good the intentions of the police officers involved, and however skilful a performer the undercover police officer may have been, the effect of what was done was to negate the defendant's right not to incriminate himself.' Keith Hall was acquitted of all charges and continues to protest his innocence. 'I did not murder my wife,' he said outside the court. 'It remains a mystery to me where she is.'</p> <p>Some undercover operations last only a few hours, others can go on for months or even years. At their simplest level, they can involve nothing more than a phone call. At the other end of the scale, a complete change of identity and location may be necessary. Most of the time, the true scale of an SO10 operation is kept hidden from public view. A line in a local newspaper that a quantity of drugs has been recovered after 'an undercover police operation' gives little indication about the time, effort and danger involved in such work.</p> <p>Philip was once kidnapped and tortured during an operation, while Martin narrowly escaped attending a meeting where an informant was shot dead. 'You never think that one job might be more dangerous than another,' says Martin. 'As far as I'm concerned, they are all dangerous.</p> <p>Any situation can get out of hand. And having to deal with such a wide range of personalities makes it even harder. In life, you always have some people that you get on with and some people that you don't. Those exact same conflicts exist when you are undercover. The difficulty there, though, is that you can't just walk away, you have to carry on with the job, no matter how much of a prat you think the person you are dealing with is.'</p> <p>The stress of pretending to be someone else comes from all directions. Undercover officers often comment on the fact that they don't like the way members of the public look at them when they are working. Especially for those who are in uniform, they are normally treated with a degree of respect. When they play a drug dealer or fraudster, people refuse to make eye contact, cross the road to avoid them, and security guards hover nearby whenever they are out shopping. It's this kind of stress that makes SO10 officers more susceptible to corruption. </p> <p>During one operation, Philip was acting as the money man in a drugs buy and had \u00a360,000 in an old carrier bag. The meeting was delayed for four hours, so rather than taking the money back to his office, he just popped home and watched a bit of TV. 'I left the money in a bag on the sofa and went upstairs to the bathroom. At the same time, my wife arrived home and almost had a heart attack. She thought I'd stolen it.' </p> <p>Another danger in 'going native' is becoming too like the people that you target. You can become so absorbed in the role you are playing, you find it almost impossible to stop. In the mid-80s, Operation Own Goal set its sights on a group of football hooligans following Chelsea. </p> <p>Teams of young, relatively inexperienced, officers were sent out to join the notorious Headhunters gang and report back. Hangers-on were not welcomed by the hooligans. The only chance the officers had of surviving was to participate in everything that was going on. And to be seen to participate. In the space of a few weeks, a number of officers had been implicated in a range of assaults, robberies and drug offences. When the operation finally came to court, all but a handful of the charges against the hooligans were thrown out. </p> <p>In 1996, following a highly critical internal report, the mechanism for monitoring the health and well-being of members of SO10 were radically overhauled. Such officers are now subjected to regular psychological checks to ensure they can be pulled out of a job at the first sign of trouble. </p> <p>For those who make the grade and continue working, the dangers remain as real as ever. </p> <p>The job that ended the careers of Philip and Martin began in Handsworth, Birmingham, when an informant for the local drug squad passed on a tip that his former friends, Carl and Lenny Marshall, were well on their way to becoming the biggest crack dealers in the Midlands.</p> <p>Crack cocaine is usually sold in 'rocks' costing around \u00a320 each, and even the most active dealers tend to have only a few rocks on them at any one time. The Marshalls, however, were selling the stuff in lumps the size of house bricks, each with a wholesale price of up to \u00a390,000.

Rather than a BMW or a Merc, they had been forced to take a Mondeo, hardly a typical drug dealer's car, because all the other vehicles in the SO10 pool had been booked out. Carl was already an hour late, but in a series of phone calls he had assured them he was on his way. The pair felt they had no option but to wait. The car was parked in a side street opposite a busy Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant. Although it was dark, there were plenty of people about and the back-up team were just seconds away. There was no real cause for concern.</p> <p>Two men in combat trousers walked by the front of the car, then turned and knocked on Philip's window. 'Do you have a light?' one of them asked. Philip wound down the window to tell them he didn't, but the second there was a gap, both men reached inside the car and tried to grab the keys from the ignition. Martin instantly jumped out of the car and gave the signal to the back-up team that they were in trouble. Then he got back in the car, expecting Philip to drive off. But he'd lost his grip on the keys, and as Martin sat down, Philip got out of the car to try to retrieve them. At that point, Martin realised there was no point staying in the car and went to get out again. He opened the door and found himself staring down the barrel of a gun.</p> <p> 'I didn't know who the gunman was - I couldn't see his face, just his eyes floating in the shadows inside the hood of his jacket. I didn't know where he came from, either: he just appeared from nowhere, the second I opened the car door, filling the gap and blocking my escape. There was a gun in his pocket and he was pointing it right at my head, finger on the trigger. His voice, a harsh mix of Birmingham street slang and Jamaican patois, was loaded with aggression. 'Get back in the car, bumba clot,' he screamed. 'Back in the car, get back in the fucking car, before I kill you.'</p> <p>'Jesus, I was terrified. I could feel everything leaving my body. I felt dead already. I just wanted to cry - that's how bad it was, I just wanted to sit there and cry right in front of him.

I knew he was in trouble, but I couldn't take the time to look round. I couldn't even blink.'</p> <p>'That's when the shooting started. It's nothing like the movies - when someone fires a gun in real life, it's deafening.

He could not believe that they hadn't got there yet. What was going on?</p> <p>And then he saw Philip and turned back.</p> <p>Philip takes up the story: 'The first shot had gone right through my calf and now I was about to take another in the chest. I felt sick inside, as I realised there was nothing I could do. I was all alone, literally staring death in the face. He was moving the gun from side to side and the light kept catching against the triangular sight over the muzzle. It was coming in and out of view, totally hypnotic.

He bounced off, while Martin span round with the momentum of the impact. The gunman tried to level his weapon, but was too shaken to line up the shot. Martin was still spinning when the bullet ripped into his right shin. I could see his leg deforming as the bullet entered.

      "bodyText": "The drug deal was going horribly wrong. Instead of coming away with \u00a310,000 worth of premium quality crack cocaine, Martin Maynard and his friend Philip Etienne had been ambushed by a team of armed Yardie gangsters who were trying to steal their money. Martin had lost count of how many shots had been fired. One had been so close he had felt its heat as it whistled past his ear. He had somehow fought his way out of the car and made a desperate run for a nearby low wall. It was only when he reached it that he risked a glance behind him. 'I was shaking with fear. I looked back and saw Philip staggering round the rear of the Mondeo. He was limping, obviously in pain, and as he passed under a streetlight I could see his right leg was soaked dark with blood. One of the gunmen was standing right in front of him, about eight feet away, and his gun was aimed directly at Philip's chest. I heard him shouting: 'D'ya want another one, bumba clot? D'ya want it again?' 'I was thinking, \"Oh Jesus, he's going to shoot Philip. He's going to fucking kill Philip\". In that fraction of a second, I had to make a decision that I would have to live with for the rest of my life. To my right was the safety of the main road. The gunman hadn't seen me, I wasn't injured, I could easily make it across. On my left was Philip, moments away from being shot dead in cold blood. It was the hardest, most agonising decision I have ever had to make. And there was just no time for it. I took one last glance at the main road, sucked in a deep breath, turned towards the gunman and started running.' It was the end both men had long feared. For the previous eight years, Philip and Martin had lived among the upper echelons of London's criminal underworld. During that time, they dealt in guns, stolen high-performance cars, stolen passports and traded vast quantities of cocaine, ecstasy and crack. With their plush Docklands flats, brand new BMWs and bulging wallets, they made a mockery of the notion that crime doesn't pay. Able to lay their hands on vast amounts of cash at a moment's notice, and with a sizable group of dedicated henchmen at their beck and call, the pair were just the kind of high-ranking professional villains that other crooks felt most comfortable dealing with. Which was just the idea. Because, in reality, Philip and Martin were undercover police officers working for Scotland Yard's most elite unit: SO10. Also known as the Crime Operations Group, SO10 (the first two letters stand for Specialist Operations) is one of the most secretive divisions within the whole of the police force. Even Special Branch (SO12), which works hand in hand with MI5, is relatively open about the nature of its work. In contrast, all of the books, brochures and information packs produced by the Metropolitan Police - even their own website - fail to mention SO10 at all. The reality of working undercover is a world away from anything that has ever been portrayed in film or on television. It is something the vast majority of police officers are totally unprepared for. 'Working in uniform or even moving into CID, you spend your time chasing after kids nicking cars or blokes with 50 quid's worth of dope in their back pockets,' says Martin. 'You never meet a real criminal. They're the people who always have a couple of grand in their wallet. They have the car of their dreams parked outside the house of their dreams. They eat in the best restaurants and get into the best clubs without ever having to queue up. When you work undercover, you have to become just like them.' Part of the challenge is working alone. Although there might be surveillance and back-up in place at the beginning of a job, officers are totally alone thereafter. With no radio or warrant card, they can neither call in help or prove who they are. And it is often only at the last minute that they will find out where a deal is to take place. 'Not only do you not know where you are going, but you also know surprisingly little about your target,' adds Philip. 'It sounds crazy but it's standard SO10 procedure that you don't delve into the background of the people you are after. The reason is clear: the more you know about someone, the more you'll end up thinking about it, even if it's only at the back of your mind. If you've been told that the man you are sitting with always keeps a pistol down the side of his boot, you're going to jump through the roof when he gets a sudden itch on his calf and reaches down to scratch it. The only way to be relaxed is to not know. It's a similar problem when it comes to identifying people. Sometimes you get given pictures so you can make sure you have got the right person, but then when you walk into a pub for the first time to meet them, you have to remember that you're not supposed to know what they look like. You can't be seen to recognise them.' For those who get past the initial assessment, the only way to qualify to work for SO10 is to go through what is widely considered to be the most difficult and demanding training course the police force has to offer. Based at the Peel Centre in Hendon, North London, the same place where the Met puts its raw recruits through their paces, the course starts at 7am on a Monday and runs straight through until 4am the following morning. If they're lucky, students manage to grab a couple of hours' sleep before starting again at 7am on Tuesday. And so it goes on, day after day, night after night, for two solid weeks. During that time, there are lectures about points of law, constant exams, assessments and exercises. There are detailed role-playing sessions where recruits learn to deal with every conceivable situation, as well as hands-on instruction in the use of hidden tape recorders, transmitters and technical equipment. They are taught about dealing with informants, reading body language, how to dress, how to act, how to speak while they are undercover. Most of all, they learn how to keep out of trouble - physical and legal. Gathering evidence while undercover is fraught with difficulty. Critical conversations can be recorded with special devices, but a whole new set of skills needs to be learned in order to get the best from them. Under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act, a police officer can only interview someone if they have first read them their rights. If they haven't done that, then any evidence obtained, no matter how damning, becomes inadmissible in a court of law. So if an officer is recording a target who begins to implicate themselves in a crime but then stops halfway through, the undercover can't ask them for more information. If they start firing questions, defence lawyers will argue that it constitutes an interview and the case will be thrown out. The most notorious example of this came a few years ago when 39-year-old mother-of-two Patricia Hall, vanished from her home in Pudsey, Leeds, on a freezing January night. Though hundreds of people disappear each year hoping to leave their troubles behind and start over, they almost always leave some kind of trail, take a bunch of personal items or stockpile cash to sustain them. Patricia had done none of these things - she hadn't even taken any warm clothing. Detectives investigating the case quickly discovered that, shortly before she vanished, Patricia allegedly told her husband, Keith, that she was going to leave him for another man, sparking a series of furious arguments. Keith, who insisted that Patricia had simply walked out on him after one particularly nasty row, became the prime suspect in his wife's murder, but not a scrap of evidence could be found to prove he was responsible or even that she was dead. Six months on, Keith placed an advert in the lonely hearts column of his local newspaper and an undercover officer known as Claire was brought in to respond. The relationship quickly flourished, and after a few months Keith proposed marriage. Claire told him she was terrified of Patricia coming back into his life, that the only way she could go forward with the relationship would be to know the absolute truth about what happened. Sitting in Claire's car, which had been fitted with microphones and recording devices, Keith said nothing for a while then whispered: 'It's okay, she's dead.' 'How do you know?' asked Claire. 'How do you think I know? I was sleeping downstairs, then I woke up. I strangled her. There was a voice in my head telling me to do it.' Later that same night, Keith explained that he had burned the body and that the police would never find it. He was arrested and charged with murder three days later. At trial, the judge, Mr Justice Waterhouse, ruled the recordings - the only real evidence against him - could not be heard because they breached the code of practice governing interview procedures. 'However good the intentions of the police officers involved, and however skilful a performer the undercover police officer may have been, the effect of what was done was to negate the defendant's right not to incriminate himself.' Keith Hall was acquitted of all charges and continues to protest his innocence. 'I did not murder my wife,' he said outside the court. 'It remains a mystery to me where she is.' Some undercover operations last only a few hours, others can go on for months or even years. At their simplest level, they can involve nothing more than a phone call. At the other end of the scale, a complete change of identity and location may be necessary. Most of the time, the true scale of an SO10 operation is kept hidden from public view. A line in a local newspaper that a quantity of drugs has been recovered after 'an undercover police operation' gives little indication about the time, effort and danger involved in such work. Philip was once kidnapped and tortured during an operation, while Martin narrowly escaped attending a meeting where an informant was shot dead. 'You never think that one job might be more dangerous than another,' says Martin. 'As far as I'm concerned, they are all dangerous. Any situation can get out of hand. And having to deal with such a wide range of personalities makes it even harder. In life, you always have some people that you get on with and some people that you don't. Those exact same conflicts exist when you are undercover. The difficulty there, though, is that you can't just walk away, you have to carry on with the job, no matter how much of a prat you think the person you are dealing with is.' The stress of pretending to be someone else comes from all directions. Undercover officers often comment on the fact that they don't like the way members of the public look at them when they are working. Especially for those who are in uniform, they are normally treated with a degree of respect. When they play a drug dealer or fraudster, people refuse to make eye contact, cross the road to avoid them, and security guards hover nearby whenever they are out shopping. It's this kind of stress that makes SO10 officers more susceptible to corruption. During one operation, Philip was acting as the money man in a drugs buy and had \u00a360,000 in an old carrier bag. The meeting was delayed for four hours, so rather than taking the money back to his office, he just popped home and watched a bit of TV. 'I left the money in a bag on the sofa and went upstairs to the bathroom. At the same time, my wife arrived home and almost had a heart attack. She thought I'd stolen it.' Another danger in 'going native' is becoming too like the people that you target. You can become so absorbed in the role you are playing, you find it almost impossible to stop. In the mid-80s, Operation Own Goal set its sights on a group of football hooligans following Chelsea. Teams of young, relatively inexperienced, officers were sent out to join the notorious Headhunters gang and report back. Hangers-on were not welcomed by the hooligans. The only chance the officers had of surviving was to participate in everything that was going on. And to be seen to participate. In the space of a few weeks, a number of officers had been implicated in a range of assaults, robberies and drug offences. When the operation finally came to court, all but a handful of the charges against the hooligans were thrown out. In 1996, following a highly critical internal report, the mechanism for monitoring the health and well-being of members of SO10 were radically overhauled. Such officers are now subjected to regular psychological checks to ensure they can be pulled out of a job at the first sign of trouble. For those who make the grade and continue working, the dangers remain as real as ever. The job that ended the careers of Philip and Martin began in Handsworth, Birmingham, when an informant for the local drug squad passed on a tip that his former friends, Carl and Lenny Marshall, were well on their way to becoming the biggest crack dealers in the Midlands. Crack cocaine is usually sold in 'rocks' costing around \u00a320 each, and even the most active dealers tend to have only a few rocks on them at any one time. The Marshalls, however, were selling the stuff in lumps the size of house bricks, each with a wholesale price of up to \u00a390,000. Broken up into street-size deals, the same crack would be worth more than \u00a3500,000. The Jamaica-born brothers had inspired such fear among the residents around their home that they were able to operate with virtual impunity. They had also successfully identified every single member of the local drug squad and all their unmarked vehicles, countering any attempts to monitor their activities. The Marshalls also refused to deal with white buyers, ruling out any kind of standard sting operation. West Midlands police decided to launch an undercover operation against the gang, but found they had only one experienced black undercover officer. He was successfully introduced to the gang via an informant, but to act on his evidence would leave the informant exposed to retribution. More undercover officers would be needed and Martin and Philip, by then two of the most experienced officers at SO10, were called in. Over the next few weeks, Martin met Carl on a number of occasions and bought nearly \u00a31,000 of crack from him. 'All the deals took place in dark alleyways with me surrounded by Carl's cronies. They were incredibly aggressive and went around in combat trousers, heavy boots and tracksuit tops with hoods up over their heads, so you could never see their faces. I've dealt with plenty of people who have been much scarier, but still it was a job I wanted to get out of the way as quickly as possible.' A date was set for Martin to buy \u00a310,000 worth of crack. At the moment the drugs were produced, a back-up team of West Midlands officers would swoop down and arrest the gang. At least, that was the plan. Just after 7pm on a cold October night, Philip and Martin were sitting in the undercover car waiting for Carl to show up.

      "body": "<p>A couple of hundred metres along from the Medici Palace in Florence, the narrow street becomes Via de' Pucci. To the right, you can see the dome of the city's great cathedral. As you fight through the crowds of American tour groups in their shorts, their video cameras at the ready, you enter a huge gated entrance. The wrought-iron gates at the other side of the passageway are locked, but you can see through into a rich courtyard.</p> <p>There is a coat of arms above the doorway, the silhouette of a Moor's head in profile. It is the symbol of the Pucci family, fashion house since the 1950s, and influential Florentine family since the 14th century when they were political advisors to the Medicis. This huge stone building is the Pucci Palazzo, the family seat and home to Cristina Pucci, wife and muse of the late Emilio Pucci, who founded the fashion business, and her daughter, Laudomia, who took over the management of the business after her father died in 1992. Next door is the home of Puccio Pucci, Emilio's elderly brother. And at the end of the block is another palazzo that once belonged to the Puccis and is now the property of the church. Two windows at the end are bricked up, as they have been since two members of the Pucci family tried to kill a passing Medici a couple of centuries ago. The rebel Puccis were hung and the windows, so the story goes, have been bricked up ever since. </p> <p>A doorman opens the reception door and we are ushered up a grand staircase, lined with the odd marble bust along the way. 'Laudomia Pucci will be with you shortly.' And we take a seat on the sumptuous, blue damask, gilded chairs and wait. This is the gallery, lined with Old Masters and a display cabinet filled with crests and awards given to Emilio for his achievements as an athlete. The ceilings tower above, with fabulous Murano glass chandeliers suspended from them. Through a doorway we can just glimpse the ballroom, laid out with tables and chairs and more statues, and another family crest.</p> <p>It is so inordinately splendid that it would not be at all surprising if Laudomia made her entrance wearing a ballgown, the taffeta swishing around as she walked. As it is, a slight, smiling woman appears, wearing black jeans and a lime- green suede zip-front jacket, lined with just a flash of Pucci print. On her feet are a pair of flat sandals with the sparkle of jewels across a single strap. Around her neck is a chunky, pale jade necklace, a present from her husband. She is not feeling great, she says. She caught a cold from her two young children and is a bit under the weather. </p> <p>Her office is a small room with a view out onto the street below. On the window ledge are two photographs, one of Tony and Cherie Blair with a note thanking Laudomia for her hospitality. This summer, the Blairs visited the Puccis for lunch at the family's country home. Laudomia was at the beach when she received a call to say they were on their way and ran off to the local shop to buy bread, cheese, salami and beer for lunch. The other picture is of Hillary Clinton, with a note thanking Laudomia for a book she had sent to her. Despite her cold, Laudomia is obviously in high spirits. 'This deal with LVMH is the best thing I have done,' she says. 'I haven't slept this well for six months.' </p> <p>Last February, the all-powerful French luxury goods group that owns everything from Louis Vuitton, Givenchy and Christian Dior to Celine and Loewe, bought a 67 per cent stake in the privately owned Pucci. The remaining 33 per cent is still held by the family. The sale means new investment in the fashion house, a brand new distribution network, global marketing plans and a string of new shops to be opened over the next 12 months. Today, the first one opens on Milan's Via Montenapoleone. Before Christmas, two more will be added to the list, one on Palm Beach, and the other in St Moritz. Others are planned for strategic spots - the Bellagio Hotel, perhaps, in LA, or a little boutique in Capri. By mid-October, the brand will be available online too, with a page on LVMH's e-luxury.com website. Since the early 90s, when Pucci enjoyed a brief revival, the brand has been a sleeping lion. Now LVMH is rattling the cage. </p> <p>A new president has been installed in one of the grand reception rooms of the palazzo. Catherine Vautrin was formerly director of ready-to-wear at Louis Vuitton, the luxury label that has been given a new lease of life by designer Marc Jacobs. 'The challenge is not to change Pucci,' she says, 'but to bring Pucci back to the front row. The archives of prints are amazing. What is known of Pucci is really the tip of the iceberg.' The house is on the hunt for a creative director. Vautrin expects to make an announcement by the end of the month. One name that has been rumoured for the job is Antonio Berardi. He has been secretly consulting on the womenswear for the past three seasons. </p> <p>Laudomia has been repositioned as image director. 'To understand a brand you have to understand the roots,' says Vautrin. 'I cannot think of a better person who can speak so well about her father, both as a man, but also as a designer, an artist, as a contributor to modern fashion.' And Laudomia has a strong sense of how she would like to see the brand move forward. 'When I came into the picture, there was this extraordinary man with his visions and his ideas, with his following and with enormous respect from the industry,' she recalls. 'But it wasn't really a structured business - it was a genius's business.'</p> <p>Since her father's death, Laudomia has been slowly building and learning. 'It's very difficult when you come into a company that's 40 years old, with all the habits of one genius person, and you're the daughter of an aristocrat, living in a palazzo, who doesn't have to work. You're not necessarily taken seriously.' She has been encouraged and supported by some of her loyal customers, however. 'We did it in a very low-profile, simple, hard-working way, and then we noticed that demand was growing and we could improve and that we needed professionals. We started hiring a PR and a designer. Now it's the right time in history; it's a merger-and-acquisition moment in fashion. Everybody is consolidating. We are lucky that colour is in fashion. If you're in the right place at the right time, things happen. We were there at the right time.' </p> <p>In pure fashion terms, Pucci could not have wished for a better moment to be reborn. Laudomia puts it all down to the economy; when things are prosperous, women wear bright colours and bold patterns. The collections for this autumn, from catwalk to chain store, are packed with Pucci references. Every fashion magazine is carrying a print story, not least because Tom Ford of Gucci took inspiration from the Florentine prince of prints, as did Donatella Versace. On the high street, there are copies of Gucci doing Pucci. The swirly, psychedelic and precise geometric prints have even crept on to tights and accessories, and into the world of interiors, too. The world has gone potty for Pucci.</p> <p>Laudomia is surprisingly cool about the fact that her father's prints have become the basis for so many others: 'Now that people see a big splash of print and say it's a Pucci or a Versace interpretation of Pucci, or a Gucci interpretation of Pucci, or whatever, they know where it's coming from and we've got the message through. I've got great admiration for Tom: whatever he does he's got his own vision, and Pucci has its own - two different people; two different companies.' </p> <p>One of the things that attracted LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault to Pucci was the history of the family. There aren't many fashion houses whose headquarters are in a historical palazzo, a stone's throw from the Duomo and the Uffizi in Florence, with an entire archive intact, along with a story of a genius aristocrat who lived to make women look beautiful.</p> <p>'Very clearly, Mr Arnault likes the concept of tradition,' says Laudomia. 'That's what he told me. He told me we represent something, that we belong here.' It is not often a businessman gets the opportunity to buy into history, and into a family with money as old as it gets. The Puccis live in a world that goes right off the luxury scale. Ralph Lauren can fantasise about Scottish castles to his heart's content. The Puccis actually live the life.</p> <p>For her 39th birthday treat the day after our interview, Laudomia had asked for a simple present from her husband: a pot of caviar to be enjoyed with her family in the countryside. It is the sort of fabulous luxury where money is incidental. 'What has intrigued Mr Arnault,' she continues, 'is that money can buy so much, and yet it is the history here, the tradition. And it's alive. That is the backbone of this story. Sometimes you might have such a story, but it's an 85-year-old lady telling it, and not someone who's got a two-year-old child, a real woman living in the real world. If Pucci had been without us, the palace, and the whole story, it would have been another thing.' </p> <p>The story of Emilio Pucci begins in 1914, with the birth in Naples of the baby Marquis of Barsento. Emilio's parents were Orazio Pucci and the countess Augusta Pavoncelli, from one of the oldest families of Florence. The young Marquis was sent to study sociology in America, then became a pilot in the Italian air force. He was an accomplished athlete and a keen skier. In 1947, he produced his first design: a man's ski suit - a hooded print jacket with stretch ski pants. The suit was photographed by American Toni Frissell of Harper's Bazaar , who showed it to the fashion diva Diana Vreeland. 'She saw the picture,' says Laudomia, 'and put my father in touch with a company called White Stag in Oregon, to produce a winter collection for Lord &amp; Taylor.' </p> <p>It all happened quite by accident. But from that moment, Emilio Pucci had the beginnings of a business. Strangely, however, Pucci is not remembered for his skiwear, but for his brightly patterned dresses, shirts and pants, worn by the jet set as they holidayed in chichi resorts. Around 1949, he opened a boutique in Capri, then a simple fishing village where 'the beautiful people' liked to go. At the time, fashion was as formal as a Dior cocktail dress. They came from an atelier in Paris or were made by a seamstress at home. Pucci saw a need for a holiday wardrobe, and his boutique, selling simple shapes in bright patterns, was a revolution. The Americans loved it and, eventually, the Italians, who weren't quite sure about an aristocrat lowering himself to design clothes, caught on, too. </p> <p>In America, Pucci was big business. In 1960, Pucci introduced his 'Emilioform' clothing - casual separates in a blend of shantung silk and nylon. It meant an evening gown could be rolled up into a little bag, and be worn without a single crease. As well as selling in Lord &amp; Taylor and Neiman Marcus, the company opened a store in New York which, along with a small boutique in Florence, near the palazzo, have been the only two Pucci shops in the world, making the label a well-kept secret. Marilyn Monroe wore Pucci to seduce Arthur Miller. Lauren Bacall wore Pucci, as did Elizabeth Taylor, Audrey Hepburn and Gina Lollobrigida. In Paris, Salvador and Gala Dali were treated to private shows. And the great thing about Pucci was that the shapes were simple and elegant and the prints totally timeless. </p> <p>In the 50s and 60s, Pucci appeared to be working in parallel with the pop and op artists. But according to Laudomia, modern art was of no interest to him. 'He loved Old Masters, so for him modern art was absolute baloney. But he was totally part of the modern art movement. That is very funny, because he did not really like anything modern. He loved what he did. He didn't see anything else. It sounds improper now when I say he didn't like modern art, but it wasn't his aesthetic. Renaissance art was his thing. His work was a reinterpretation of the old.' </p> <p>In the ballroom of the palazzo, where Pucci first showed his collections before the ready-to-wear shows began in Milan, a series of busts of Roman emperors surrounds the room. They have been painted in the Pucci palette of emerald greens and ruby reds, a merry prank typical of Emilio's irreverent sense of humour. Laudomia began working with her father from the age of 23, after she finished university.</p> <p>'As a child you know what you see, and what you see is normal,' she says. 'So that is how I think it's been relatively easy for me to pass on this message and keep it going because it is part of my upbringing, part of my language, part of my aesthetics, part of my genes. The logics of prints and colour are like a language, and that is probably what I've learnt most from my father. This balance of colours, and of movement in his prints is what I think I can really relate to.' But she is well aware that it is not enough any more to have an archive of prints, however historic. 'The world has changed,' she says. 'We're talking about a mass culture of luxury. Everybody travels today. So when you call it a jet-set society you are talking about an elite society. Today, everybody's jet setting. There is mass luxury.' </p> <p>Emilio had already cast his vision beyond clothes. He designed carpets - there are several bright rugs dotted around the palazzo, including Laudomia's own apartment within the palazzo, a light, modern, place. From the terrace, you can almost touch the Duomo. Inside, there are ceramics, cushion covers, towels and curtains, all with Emilio's mark. A Christian Liaigre sofa is covered in Pucci fabric. In the children's room (Laudomia has two children: Tancredi, two, and Larissa, four) toys are wrapped in bags covered with Pucci print. In his lifetime, Emilio had developed the fashion line into accessories, perfume, handbags, a home line and perfume. It's just that the curtains and cushions were made for the palazzo, and the carpets were in a tiny limited edition. But the potential for growth is obvious. </p> <p>Next year, Fondazione Emilio Pucci will open on the Palazzo Pucci's ground floor, with exhibitions and a research centre. It will be another stop on the tourists' schedule. Pucci is ready and waiting. And the marketing men and women at LVMH are going to move quickly, to spread a lot of luxury a little more thinly so we can all share a piece of it. 'It just needs an enormous amount of help,' says Laudomia. 'It's all there,' she says, and with all the pride of daddy's little girl, whispers, 'It's a little jewel, you know?'</p> <p>\u0095 Pucci's autumn/winter collection is available from Browns, 23-27 South Molton Street, London W1 (020 7491 7833); and Joseph, 77 Fulham Road, London SW3 (020 7590 6200); Harvey Nichols, Knightsbridge, London SW1 (020 7235 5000)</p>",

      "bodyText": "A couple of hundred metres along from the Medici Palace in Florence, the narrow street becomes Via de' Pucci. To the right, you can see the dome of the city's great cathedral. As you fight through the crowds of American tour groups in their shorts, their video cameras at the ready, you enter a huge gated entrance. The wrought-iron gates at the other side of the passageway are locked, but you can see through into a rich courtyard. There is a coat of arms above the doorway, the silhouette of a Moor's head in profile. It is the symbol of the Pucci family, fashion house since the 1950s, and influential Florentine family since the 14th century when they were political advisors to the Medicis.

      "body": "<p>' Would you like a swim?' Domitilla Getty is known to be a generous and relaxed hostess. And after a long and dusty drive deep into the hills of Tuscany, to the country farmhouse she and her husband Mark Getty (grandson of John Paul, the oil tycoon, and owner of the famous Hulton Getty picture archive) bought in the 80s, the thought of plunging into a pool could not be sweeter. </p> <p>It is the last day of Domitilla's summer in the country before she flies back to the couple's home in Battersea in London. There is work to be done over the next few months. The swimming pool - a big square of rippling turquoise - is going to have a make- over. 'Tuscany is like Miami now,' says Domitilla. In accordance with tougher planning laws in Tuscany, the pool will be painted black so that it doesn't stand out quite so much from the greenery of the surrounding hills. Next summer, it will be dark and velvety, like a natural pond. But Domitilla confesses she never swims in it anyway. She prefers to dive into the sparkling river nearby, with its waterfalls and rocks. Her three children, all boys aged between 10 and 16, love the pool, of course, as do their friends, who often come to stay. 'This place can be really chaotic,' says Domitilla. </p> <p>To call this a farmhouse is an understatement. It's actually a small village, with the main house, two wells, and several other smaller houses, barns and outhouses - one with its own olive press, dated 1821 - clustered around it. Originally, families of 15 would have lived in a two-room house, above their animals. But when the Gettys discovered it - Domitilla's mother-in-law was one of the first to spot the potential of a Tuscan farmhouse when she bought hers back in 1963 - there was just one old hermit still living there. When he died the place went up for auction and it was a case of paying a mere \u00a3500 to the nine different owners of the houses, some of whom didn't even know the properties existed. Mark has called the country retreat one of their greatest luxuries. Although it was a bargain to buy, it must have been a bottomless money pit since. </p> <p>From the outside, the buildings look quite tumbledown and ramshackle. Part of that is on purpose ('if you re-do the rendering they look all modern', says Domitilla) and part of it is because there are some buildings that they haven't even started on yet. They are still in the same state as they were in the 80s, literally dark, crumbling stone barns with wooden shutters. The main house has charmingly rough rendering, and lots of lovely bougainvillea creeping over it. A stone near the entrance has a date etched into it: eighteen fifty-something. When the roof was being mended on the house by the pool, the workmen found another date on a terracotta tile which had been there since 1588. But the house has been on the maps, says Domitilla, since the first century. </p> <p>Inside, you can see how old the place is by the thickness of the walls. The main living area is on the first floor, as it would have been originally. 'There were animals everywhere underneath and the signori would have lived on the top floor.' What is astonishing about the house, however, is not the thickness of the walls, but what's painted on them. In almost every room, the original stencilling, used to decorate instead of wallpaper, has been restored. 'This might have been the old dining room,' suggests Domitilla, pointing out the bowl of fruit painted above the doorway. The walls are covered with detailed frescoes of rural life, with hills, castles, clouds, birds, and bowls of fruit. Upstairs in the bedrooms and bathrooms, the stencilled patterns are immaculate. Many were only discovered after the layers of white paint on the walls had been removed. 'It was very much like finding treasure,' she says. </p> <p>If you have ever wondered why there was such a fuss about stencilling in the 80s, this is a very good reason. But there is nothing twee about these stencils, which date from the 19th century. The walls in one bedroom look as though they have been done with woodblocks, a pattern repeated around the whole room in rich Tuscan earthy reds. The stencils give the house both a rustic simplicity and a decorative richness that dictate the overall look of the place. 'I hate modern stencils,' says Domitilla. 'But this is real. All the ceilings were done with brick red Terra de Siena, and lots of the stencils are painted with it too. They were made to look like old grand palaces.' </p> <p>There is nothing flash or vulgar about the Getty farmhouse. The furniture is homely and simple, a mix of rustic antiques and modern comfort. We have walked into the main hallway, with its huge stone fireplace - more of a bonfire than a hearth - and into a room with a great stone trough of a sink. When they first bought the place, the sink had fallen through into the room below, but luckily, it was unbroken. The floor tiles were made in Morocco to a traditional Italian design. The next room is Domitilla's study, with a big, old desk, from which she runs a small, cult fashion label called Miss Italy. Domitilla first began with a small collection of bikinis she sold at The Cross in west London. 'The idea is to recycle the old fabrics and use old techniques to keep the tradi tional artisans of Italy going.' She began using vintage fabrics, but now as the business has grown, she uses new fabrics too so that pieces can be properly manufactured by her team of women who work from an old butchers shop in the village. </p> <p>At one end of the study is an armoire packed with rolls of brightly coloured fabrics, collected by Domitilla wherever she goes. Her sample room is brick with a timber roof, and clothes hanging from the window shutters - new designs, mixed with items of vintage clothing that might have inspired a sleeve here or a collar shape there. 'The whole collection for next summer is based on Capri in the 50s,' says Domitilla. There are lido trousers, shirts made out of fine Jacquards usually used for men's shirts, a Principessa dress, a little 40s jacket, and her signature 'house dress' - a simple print summer dress with a frill at the hem, like the ones both she and her Italian cook, Ivana, are wearing today. </p> <p>A solid stone staircase leads upstairs into a long hallway, painted white and hung with little French chandeliers. 'There were no bathrooms originally,' says Domitilla. Now there are two, and 10 bedrooms used mainly by the family. Guests who stay have a choice of the 'big house' or the house by the pool, which has a huge reception downstairs and a bedroom with a simple four-poster bed made locally. In one room, there are two wonderful Art Deco chrome beds, with bronze statuettes at the bottom and medallions at the heads. 'That's where you would have had inscribed the husband and wife's initials.' Domitilla bought them from the Arezzo antique market. </p> <p>She was born in New York, but went to school in Rome where she trained at the fashion and theatre design school. After she and Mark married, they moved to San Francisco, New York and then to London, where they have lived for 15 years. She had her first child at the age of 24. Now that the children are old enough to look after themselves, she is getting on with her own business. As well as the clothes, there is a line of shoes and accessories and she plans to launch a perfume next spring. 'I would love to live in Italy full-time,' she says. 'I would rather live in the country. There are always a lot of people here so you never feel isolated.' </p> <p>Over a lunch of simple pasta with home-grown tomatoes, garlic and basil from the vegetable plot, a dish of baked courgettes, salad, and prosciutto, followed by soft, melt-in-the-mouth almond biscuits (a local speciality), Domitilla chats merrily away, occasionally humming along to the soundtrack of classic Italian songs she has put together to play at the opening of a show of fashion and photography in London.

      "bodyText": "' Would you like a swim?' Domitilla Getty is known to be a generous and relaxed hostess. And after a long and dusty drive deep into the hills of Tuscany, to the country farmhouse she and her husband Mark Getty (grandson of John Paul, the oil tycoon, and owner of the famous Hulton Getty picture archive) bought in the 80s, the thought of plunging into a pool could not be sweeter. It is the last day of Domitilla's summer in the country before she flies back to the couple's home in Battersea in London. There is work to be done over the next few months. The swimming pool - a big square of rippling turquoise - is going to have a make- over. 'Tuscany is like Miami now,' says Domitilla.

      "body": "<p>Soon after the Second World War, my father started importing printed silks from Como to Egypt, and because of his business, we spent long holidays in Italy every year. My connection with Italy continued after I left home. My first job in London in 1957 was with Alitalia. I was paid \u00a37 a week, but I had endless free flights to Italy. And when I married, my husband began importing baby clothes from Milan and Turin. So my visits continued.</p> <p>Apart from the constantly changing landscape, the historic towns with medieval streets that carry you straight into the heart of the Renaissance, my childhood memories are of the people we met, the songs we sang and the foods we ate. In the old days, Italians took their holidays in Italy, usually returning to the same place year after year, and so did we, meeting the same people each year. I remember the song 'I Mariti in Citta' which was about what husbands got up to when their wives and children went on holiday and they stayed behind in the city.</p> <p>Italians then were not interested in the food of regions outside their own. The north had not yet been invaded by immigrants from the south and there were still culinary borders and a precise geography of food. The great cleavage was that which divided the north from the south. There was butter in the north, pork fat in the centre and olive oil in the south. The Italy of polenta and rice and of boiled meats was in the north, and the Italy of pizza and spaghetti was in the south.</p> <p>Every region in Italy has its own culinary specialities. The extraordinary diversity is a legacy of Italy's fragmented past and its division, until the unification of the country in 1861, into many independent sovereign states. There were kingdoms, duchies, lordships and republics, papal and city states, and each had its own history, culture and traditions.</p> <p>Milan's region Lombardy is still a mosaic, with differences in the cooking of the plain (the basin of the river Po), lakes, hills and mountains; rich and poor traditions, and elements of old court cuisines. It is also an important livestock and milk-producing region, as well as being pig country, producing a rich variety of salami.</p> <p>Every town has its own tastes and smells and dishes you remember it by. In Milan, it is the minestrone, with beans and pancetta, osso bucco - shin of veal cooked in white wine, chopped parsley, lemon rind and anchovy, risotto giallo with saffron and bone marrow; breaded and fried costoletta, and apple charlotte. In Mantova, it is the heavenly tortelli di zucca. Cremona is known for the thrilling mostarda which mingles the sweet taste of fruits with the powerful essence of mustard. Bergamo, the Valtellina and all the mountain regions of Lombardy evoke polenta - polenta with sausage, polenta with songbirds, with gorgonzola, with beans and pork, with snails, with mushrooms.</p> <p>Our favourite mountain resort was Pocol above Cortina d'Ampezzo. We had a special relationship with the kitchen. My younger brother, Zaki, would get up early in the morning to catch frogs which the cooks deep-fried, or stewed in wine, or put in a risotto. I would spend hours picking wild strawberries in the woodland. Neither of us would eat the frogs, but we got extra large portions of strawberries with sugar and whipped cream.</p> <p>In the 50s, my uncle and aunt moved to Milan from Paris and their home became the focus of our visits. My uncle Jo was in banking. Aunt Doris was famous for telling crude jokes - although women in Egypt, where she was from, were not supposed to tell any jokes at all - and was the most glamorous woman in the family. In those days, France was the capital of fashion and everything fashionable came from there. And grand restaurants, such as Savini in the Galleria, served French food. Everyone in the household liked different things, so we had a wide choice at mealtimes. Jo liked costoletta. Doris's favourite was osso bucco. For my cousin Donald there was asparagus and little Peter would only eat salami.</p> <p>One day, the maid prepared polenta with sausage. She told us that in her home in the mountains, it was poured straight on to the table and the cut-up sausage was placed in the centre. Each member of the family had to finish eating the polenta that had spread out in front of them before they were allowed to eat the sausage. Her brothers ate so fast they always finished the sausage before she could even get a bite.</p> <p>Rice was the food of the urban rich and polenta was the food of the rural poor. It had not yet become fashionable. At home, today, in the north, pasta has taken the place of both rice and polenta, because they take longer to cook.</p> <p>A pizzeria opened opposite my uncle's flat in the Via San Giovanni Sul Muro. It was the beginning of what was to be the great invasion of pizzasand restaurants serving foods from all regions of Italy. The only foreign restaurant was Chinese. Italians would not eat there. It was whispered that they cooked cats and dogs. By the 70s, pizza and spaghetti from the south had become the food of all Italy.</p> <p>Italians have always been conservative in their culinary tastes, but the first steps away from tradition came in the mid-60s in the form of the fashion for 'threes' and 'fours' when everything - spaghetti, omelettes, pizza - had three or four herbs or three or four cheeses. Now Italian food is a favourite of the world, and Milan has gone international. Designer restaurants serving ethnic and fusion foods - Japanese, Chinese, Indian, Sri Lankan, Russian - are all the rage. The young go to McDonald's, and pizzas have been Americanised. But at the same time, regional cooking is flowering again. Nostalgia and fascination with the past and the quest for identity have brought a revival of interest in traditional cooking and a respect for genuine produce. They call it il ricupero (the retrieval) and la riscoperta (the rediscovery). When I was last in the region, chefs were showing me handwritten recipe books by nonnine (little grandmothers). They were tracking down home-made produce, collecting wild plants, and getting farmers to raise quail, ducks, geese and game.</p> <p>They explained that they wanted to update tradition, not embalm it. There is now a movement called 'slow food' to safeguard standards of quality and the traditional gastronomic heritage.</p> <p>Years ago, I remember the owner of a restaurant being angry when I remarked that I wanted only traditional local foods. 'Why must we remain stuck in the past?' he complained. It is natural that food should always develop and change, but in a world where everything increasingly feels as though it's the same, what appeals and touches the heart, for us outsiders, is that which distinguishes Italy, which recalls her past and which is part of her precious heritage and traditions.</p> <p><b> Risotto con la zucca (Pumpkin risotto)</b></p> <p>Use the pumpkins sold, cut into slices, in many Indian and Middle Eastern stores. Serves 4</p> <p><b>1 piece of pumpkin (about 300g) <br> 1 onion, chopped <br> 1 tbsp olive oil <br> 250ml milk <br> 1 litre chicken stock (or 1 1 / 2 stock cubes) <br> 350g risotto rice <br> 50g butter </b></p> <p>Peel the pumpkin, remove the seeds, and cut into cubes. Fry the onion in the oil till soft. Add the pumpkin, season, then cover with milk. Simmer for 5-15 minutes until tender. Bring the stock to the boil in a large pan, throw in the rice and simmer for 18 minutes. When the rice is tender, stir in the pumpkin and butter and heat through. Serve with grated Parmesan.</p> <p><b> Anatra all'aceto balsamico (Duck breast with balsamic vinegar)</b></p> <p>I had this simple dish at the Santini's Ristorante del Pescatore at Canneto sull'Oglio, where you watch ducklings swim in a pond. Serves 4</p> <p><b>4 duck breasts <br> 1-2 tbsp sunflower oil<br> 2 tbsp balsamic vinegar <br> 1 / 4 tsp of ground cinnamon <br> 4 tbsp of blueberries or cranberries </b></p> <p>Heat the oil in a frying pan. Put in the duck breasts, skin side down, and cook on a low flame. Turn over when the fat under the skin has melted and the skin is golden. Add the vinegar, seasoning, cinnamon and berries. Cover and cook for a further 15 minutes. The berries melt to make a delicious sauce. Serve the breasts with the sauce poured over them.</p> <p><b> Pere al forno (Baked pears)</b></p> <p>Serve with mascarpone. Serves 6</p> <p><b>1 kg large, unpeeled pears <br> 250g caster sugar <br> 250ml dry Marsala or red wine <br> 1 stick of cinnamon <br> 1 vanilla pod or a few drops of essence <br> 150ml water </b></p> <p>Stand the pears in an oven-proof dish with the ingredients. Bake, uncovered, for 1 1 / 2 -2 hours at 150 C/gas mark 4. Serve hot or cold.</p> <p>\u0095 Nigel Slater will be back next week.</p>",

Italians have always been conservative in their culinary tastes, but the first steps away from tradition came in the mid-60s in the form of the fashion for 'threes' and 'fours' when everything - spaghetti, omelettes, pizza - had three or four herbs or three or four cheeses. Now Italian food is a favourite of the world, and Milan has gone international. Designer restaurants serving ethnic and fusion foods - Japanese, Chinese, Indian, Sri Lankan, Russian - are all the rage. The young go to McDonald's, and pizzas have been Americanised. But at the same time, regional cooking is flowering again. Nostalgia and fascination with the past and the quest for identity have brought a revival of interest in traditional cooking and a respect for genuine produce. They call it il ricupero (the retrieval) and la riscoperta (the rediscovery). When I was last in the region, chefs were showing me handwritten recipe books by nonnine (little grandmothers). They were tracking down home-made produce, collecting wild plants, and getting farmers to raise quail, ducks, geese and game. They explained that they wanted to update tradition, not embalm it. There is now a movement called 'slow food' to safeguard standards of quality and the traditional gastronomic heritage. Years ago, I remember the owner of a restaurant being angry when I remarked that I wanted only traditional local foods. 'Why must we remain stuck in the past?' he complained. It is natural that food should always develop and change, but in a world where everything increasingly feels as though it's the same, what appeals and touches the heart, for us outsiders, is that which distinguishes Italy, which recalls her past and which is part of her precious heritage and traditions. Risotto con la zucca (Pumpkin risotto) Use the pumpkins sold, cut into slices, in many Indian and Middle Eastern stores. Serves 4 1 piece of pumpkin (about 300g) 1 onion, chopped 1 tbsp olive oil 250ml milk 1 litre chicken stock (or 1 1 / 2 stock cubes) 350g risotto rice 50g butter Peel the pumpkin, remove the seeds, and cut into cubes. Fry the onion in the oil till soft. Add the pumpkin, season, then cover with milk. Simmer for 5-15 minutes until tender. Bring the stock to the boil in a large pan, throw in the rice and simmer for 18 minutes. When the rice is tender, stir in the pumpkin and butter and heat through. Serve with grated Parmesan. Anatra all'aceto balsamico (Duck breast with balsamic vinegar) I had this simple dish at the Santini's Ristorante del Pescatore at Canneto sull'Oglio, where you watch ducklings swim in a pond. Serves 4 4 duck breasts 1-2 tbsp sunflower oil 2 tbsp balsamic vinegar 1 / 4 tsp of ground cinnamon 4 tbsp of blueberries or cranberries Heat the oil in a frying pan. Put in the duck breasts, skin side down, and cook on a low flame. Turn over when the fat under the skin has melted and the skin is golden. Add the vinegar, seasoning, cinnamon and berries. Cover and cook for a further 15 minutes. The berries melt to make a delicious sauce. Serve the breasts with the sauce poured over them. Pere al forno (Baked pears) Serve with mascarpone. Serves 6 1 kg large, unpeeled pears 250g caster sugar 250ml dry Marsala or red wine 1 stick of cinnamon 1 vanilla pod or a few drops of essence 150ml water Stand the pears in an oven-proof dish with the ingredients. Bake, uncovered, for 1 1 / 2 -2 hours at 150 C/gas mark 4. Serve hot or cold. \u0095 Nigel Slater will be back next week.",

      "body": "<p>In the early 90s, you knew you'd arrived as a rock group the day you made it on to MTV and the Beavis &amp; Butthead show. So it's 1993 and the joke is that Beavis has heard the song before, while Butthead hasn't. Over soft guitars, someone is singing in a baleful falsetto about a girl who makes him cry. Butthead is not alone in feeling impatient.</p> <p>Beavis: 'Don't worry Butthead, it gets cool in a minute.'</p> <p>Butthead: 'It better start rocking or I'll really give him something to cry about.'</p> <p>Beavis: 'Shut up Butthead, it's cool. Check it out, check it out! Here it comes...'</p> <p>[Metallic guitars ejaculate into a chorus of 'I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo, I don't belong here.']</p> <p>Beavis: 'Yes! Yes!'</p> <p>Butthead: 'This is pretty cool.'</p> <p>Beavis: 'Yeah yeah yeah yeah.'</p> <p>Butthead: 'Uh?...Uhh?'</p> <p>[The soft guitars return.]</p> <p>Beavis: 'What... what's going on...? How come they don't just, like, play that cool part through the whole song?'</p> <p>Butthead: 'Well, Beavis, if they didn't have, like, a part of the song that sucked, then, it's like, the other part wouldn't be as cool.'</p> <p>Beavis: 'Really? You're pretty smart Butthead. Hey, here it comes again. Yes! Yes! Raaawk...!'</p> <p>By the end, they've observed that the singer seems a little low on self-esteem and have helpfully struck up a chant of 'I am somebody, I am somebody'. They are sending up Radiohead, five sallow public schoolboys from Oxford, and they will be neither the first nor the last. Back home, the single which broke them in the US, 'Creep', sank without trace on the first occasion of its release. The NME called them 'a lily-livered excuse for a rock band' ('and they may have had a point,' affable guitarist Ed O'Brien allows late one night in a Parisian hotel bar, seven years later). They were dismissed as a corporate-funded Nirvana-lite and eclipsed by the arrival of Suede, a home-grown rebuke to American grunge, who presaged Britpop and had everything Radiohead didn't; a clear raison d' \u00eatre, a great first album and the support of the press.</p> <p>And Suede had a sexy singer. If John Osborne had been born 30 years after he was, there is no question he'd have chosen rock'n'roll over the theatre, and if you imagine the adenoidal playwright modified with a few genes from Richard III, you have the public face of Radiohead's singer circa 1993. Thom Yorke was born in October 1968, with the muscles in his left eye paralysed, a condition which demanded no less than five operations before the age of six. It can still be the case that when he turns his head to the side and fixes you with his cornflower-blue right eye, his left appears to be glaring at someone on the other side of the room, who's annoying him even more than you are. Strangely, this gives him a kind of presence and may be what drummer Phil Selway is referring to when he says that Yorke 'was very noticeable and always stood out in a crowd' at school.</p> <p>Needless to say, the singer was teased mercilessly when young and could be forgiven for being in a funk with the world, which he learnt from an early age to vent through his music. He was a fighter at school and there is often an undercurrent of rage and frustration in even his most reflective lyrics. He confirms that he still gets hate mail from fans he upset during his last tour. 'Being in a band is about wreaking revenge on the world,' he once conceded. 'It's like when you get chucked by your first girlfriend. You just say to yourself: \"I'm going to be famous one day, and she'll regret that...\"'</p> <p>Now we find Thom Yorke standing on a stage, inside a huge blue tent, with lights skittering across the angled surfaces above him and 10,000 rapt Parisians gazing at him from below. In the early days, you'd have got long odds on Radiohead being here, with two seminal albums under their belts, in the form of The Bends (1995) and OK Computer (1997). You'd have got longer odds on their fourth album, Kid A, which is released tomorrow, sparking the kind of critical discussion which hasn't been heard since the two European groups who changed pop - the Beatles and Kraftwerk - were at their peaks. Some critics are calling it a commercial suicide note.</p> <p>This is the second of two Parisian dates on a short European tour which involves two different tents leapfrogging each other across the continent. It's an enormous production and all the dates are sold out. At this particular moment toward the end of the show, Yorke is the only real focus. His voice brings to mind an angel being attacked by a swarm of bees and he spins a melody the way a spider spins a web, gossamer and intricate, allowing it to drift across a jackhammer electro beat which makes the floor judder and your scalp tingle. As lights strobe and guitarists O'Brien and Jonny Greenwood help to propel the song towards an urgent crescendo, Yorke starts to shudder and squirm as though someone's plugged him into the mains, as though caught up in religious ecstasy. It's an extraordinary moment and I've only ever heard a more fevered response to something a band has done once before - and Take That only had to walk on stage at Wembley to elicit that.</p> <p>The song is 'Idioteque' and tonight's audience have never heard it before, or anything like it. It's the eighth tune on Kid A and the most striking result of a creative crisis that afflicted the group and has taken the better part of two turbulent years to resolve. The trouble began with OK Computer, which is regarded, with a degree of unanimity as the finest British rock album of the past decade (closely followed by The Bends).</p> <p>In its wake, the quintet were obliged to tour for a full 12 months, a process which they had been through with The Bends and nearly failed to recover from. This time, Yorke came back disenchanted with the guitar music he had been making and resolved to change it. Melody, he has said, came to seem like 'an embarrassment'. He wanted the emphasis to switch to rhythm. 'I just wasn't interested in guitar music anymore,' he will tell me, going on to deny any suggestions that bravery was involved in tearing Radiohead down and starting over again, saying, 'Yeah, but things were being torn down anyway. That's how I felt. There was no being brave. It was \"I either do this or forget it. Just stop.\"'</p> <p>The frightening thing, Yorke will add, is that he saw no way out. He had always been the catalyst for Radiohead and there was no one else to take up the reins now. ('We operate like the UN,' he told one interviewer drily, 'and I'm America.')</p> <p>In February 1999, the five members convened in Paris for a month during which almost nothing was achieved. The same thing happened in Copenhagen later, during which time each individual member had begun to have doubts as to whether the less traditional, less methodical approach the singer was trying to foist on them could ever work - and even if it did, whether there would be a place for them within it.</p> <p>Yorke had played in a techno group called Flickernoise while studying art and English at Exeter University, but the electronic artists he was holding up as pointers to the way forward now (such as The Aphex Twin and Autechre) mostly worked on their own or in pairs. Nothing was happening and the band was insecure. On some of the tracks, none of them were being asked to contribute directly at all. Only three of the 10 pieces that would eventually comprise Kid A have any obvious guitar parts on them. Selway was not alone in realising that they had been together for 15 years and were essentially the same schoolboy band they'd started out as. But they weren't schoolboys anymore.</p> <p>Tensions rose until a series of blazing rows led to an acknowledgment that there was space for them all, even though they might not be playing their usual instruments on every track, and earlier this year the album began to take shape. The group were reputedly close to splitting up again in February over the issue of whether to pour all of the 23 tracks they'd recorded on to a double album, or whittle it down to a concise single disc. Once the brooding, piano-driven 'Everything In Its Right Place' had been chosen to open proceedings, the rest of the sequence followed naturally. At only 48 minutes long, Kid A was conceived of, and sounds like, a unitary piece of work, rather than a collection of songs.</p> <p>Radiohead will admit to eschewing photo shoots partly because they look so peculiar together. They range in height from Yorke's flyweight 5'7\", to Ed O'Brien's hulking 6'5\", and in age from drummer Selway's 33 to Jonny Greenwood's boyish 28. They met at Abingdon school in the Oxford suburbs and, Yorke excepted, are as articulate and easy-going a crew as you could hope to find anywhere.</p> <p>I met the brothers Jonny and Colin Greenwood (guitar and bass, respectively) in a north London restaurant, where we chatted amiably about the obvious things, along with history (which Colin read at Peterhouse College, Cambridge), books and music. Jonny was at his most animated when describing the influence of composers Penderecki and Messiaen on his string arrangements for OK Computer and Kid A and Colin explained Radiohead's attitude to fame and success in a way that was unusually comprehensible.</p> <p>'I think, as long as you keep moving, you're all right,' he said. 'The thing is you're always developing and expanding. It's a protean thing and a public image can't keep pace with it. So it - the process of success - is like this slow-drying glue that sets around you, that slows you down and gums you up. And while all that's happening, your own life's going on at the side of it, with your own relationships and your own experiences and that becomes sort of calcified as well. And the whole thing just grinds to a halt really. And then you suddenly find yourself in the paper or on the cover of a magazine and your life and experiences have become summarised. And once its summarised, its over. So the trick is to try to be in the corner of people's vision, but not full on.'</p> <p>How much do you feel like rock stars, I'd asked? There had been a wary pause, before Jonny pitched in with 'I don't know. It feels like Radiohead are famous. But that no one knows who we are. Which is brilliant, really.'</p> <p>By the time we sit down to talk on the train from Paris to London, Thom Yorke has been a thorn in my side for several days. On the whole, he doesn't talk to the British press, because he feels misunderstood and misrepresented by them. He is annoyed by the accusations of miserabalism and implications that he is a spoilt middle-class charlatan. On the latter, he is vituperative.</p> <p>'The middle-class thing has never been relevant,' he spits. 'We live in Oxford, and in Oxford we're fucking lower class. The place is full of the most obnoxious, self-indulgent, self-righteous oiks on the fucking planet, and for us to be called middle class... well, no, actually. Be around on May Day when they all reel out of the pubs at five in the morning puking up and going \"haw haw haw\" and trying to hassle your girlfriend...'</p> <p>He has also been irked by assumptions that a song like 'Exit Music (For A Film)' from OK Computer is about suicide, and that an early number like Anyone Can Play Guitar is a sardonic swipe at the vacuity of being in a band, when it was intended as an innocent celebration. Phil Selway has protested that 'I've always seen our songs as being quite positive. They confront very painful topics, but at some time there's always a sense that there's a struggle with them and an attempt to overcome them.' Yorke, too, considers that he worked through a lot of his post-adolescent angst on the patchy first album, Pablo Honey, and changed through the making of The Bends, at which time he realised that 'there's a fine line between writing something with genuine emotional impact and turning into little idiots feeling sorry for ourselves and playing stadium rock'.</p> <p>The lyrics for Kid A will not be printed on the sleeve and Yorke has resisted even explaining them to the band. A few, like the refrain of 'You can try the best you can/ you can try the best you can/ the best you can is good enough' - a piece of advice his girlfriend frequently offers him - on 'Optimistic', seem self-evident. Most do not. He describes the indiscernible words to the whispering electronic title track as 'the most vicious I've ever sung'.</p> <p>Yorke has been avoiding me to a degree that has begun to assume comic proportions and I'm marvelling at the extent to which people come to resemble their persecutors after a time, when word arrives that he will talk.</p> <p>When I finally settle into a seat opposite him, I find him disarmingly friendly, even warm. He smiles and laughs a lot, turning out to have a keen sense of humour. I ask why he is so fearful of these situations and he explains that he doesn't like having to answer for something that someone else has written. He no longer reads anything about himself, not even reviews of his records.</p> <p>We return to the turmoil that descended on Kid A.</p> <p>'When we finished the OK Computer tour, I had a sort of big... block. I basically thought that was it. I thought that I wouldn't be able to do whatever it is that I do again. We were still sort of working, but I had no faith in it. So I was in this endless cycle - and it was very much on my own as well, because we didn't see each other much for awhile. And I was doing bits and pieces, mucking around really. But in the process I was discovering that I'd lost all confidence in myself.'</p> <p>Why? You had just made two critically and commercially successful albums. What more did you want?</p> <p>'Yeah, but if you've lost faith in the way that you're going, then that's where you end up. I always used to use music as a way of moving on and dealing with things and I sort of felt like, that the thing that helped me deal with things had been sold to the highest bidder and I was simply doing its bidding. And I couldn't handle that. And that was all sort of wrapped up with feeling huge amounts of guilt about something that, when it was good, just came naturally anyway. So it all just went round and round in circles for ages. So there's no bravado about we're gonna shake this shit up, really. It's more like, I can't carry on like this.'</p> <p>Do you have any sympathy with the idea that rock has run its course and there's nothing left to do but trot out the tired cliches?</p> <p>'Oh yeah, absolutely. Totally. I 100 per cent agree with it.'</p> <p>But Radiohead are regarded as one of the few groups capable of taking it anywhere new.</p> <p>'God help us if we are. The thing I have a problem with is the fact that so much of what people - of what journalists - term rock music now is really not based on the music itself, but based on the lifestyle that goes with it. It's like a lifestyle choice... That doesn't mean that people should stop using drums and guitars, but why stand up and say, \"I'm a rock star - in 10 years time I'm going to get fucked up on smack...\" The mythology around it has run its course and is stale and uncreative now, and it has been destroying the people who've been trying to make the music.</p> <p>'I worry about that in the context of the album we've just done, as well. I absolutely want no part in any suggestions that our decision to use some electronic instruments is some kind of lifestyle choice. It's not. You use the instrument to help you get across a certain thing that you want to get across. That's all.'</p> <p>But haven't you often been hostage to the belief that you need to be in a state of turmoil to be creative?</p> <p>'No. No, I dealt with that one. I think the turmoil that is required is one that you can find any day walking down the street. I don't think you need to go and seek it out. Any normal human being goes through states of flux which they need to resolve by talking to people or making their art or whatever.'</p> <p>Would it be true to say that you have a generally pessimistic caste of mind, though?</p> <p>'No. I don't think so.'</p> <p>That's certainly your reputation.</p> <p>'Yeah, whatever. It depends what it's about. No I don't think like that at all, actually. For me, even when things are incredibly bleak in terms of the world you see reflected in the newspaper, I still sort of find you can get excited when you look in people's eyes when they walk down the street and sometimes you see really nasty, terrifying things, but most of the time you just see a bunch of people trying to get it together and there's something really hopeful in that. It sounds a bit bonkers, but there you go.'</p> <p>You've found touring tiresome and destructive in the past. Having seen it as close quarters, I'm constantly surprised that anyone with a modicum of sensitivity and/or intelligence survives that life for more than a year.</p> <p>'I don't think they do. I think they either step out, or they go pop.'</p> <p>Have you felt close to doing either of those things?</p> <p>'Oh, I did go pop.' He smiles broadly and gazes out of the window, chuckling. 'I definitely went pop.'</p> <p>How did this 'pop' manifest itself?</p> <p>'Oh it was a fairly quiet little pop, really. I was really... I saw this really cheesy Bruce Lee film, the story of his life. And there's this bit in it where he's standing between two mirrors and there's this break and he goes nuts and he has a seizure. Well it was like that without the seizure. It was just on and off really. I mean it wasn't like... it was just a state of mind. But in a way it was just kind of not knowing how to deal with it. And I look back now and I'm really quite happy that it happened, because it makes you decide what to do and then go on that path for awhile. And then you sort of pick yourself up and you carry on and you feel so much better that you've done it. It feels like I'm a little bit tougher than I was. I have more confidence.</p> <p>'I got really into these hawthorn hedges in the woods near where I live. The way the branches weave together reminds me of a human brain and I love the way that the rain flows along them and the life that's lived in them - it's like this path you choose to take and it gets thinner at the end. And I used to draw these things endlessly, for weeks on end, I used to go sit in the woods and draw these trees. I still do it.'</p> <p>Did your friends stick by you through what sounds like a breakdown of some kind?</p> <p>'They were brilliant. Even when I was being a bastard , they were really cool about it. That's when you find out... and that's another cliche. What I should really be doing is wearing a cowboy hat...'</p> <p>Do you think the rest of the band is secure with your new recording methods now? You could work alone if you wanted to.</p> <p>'No, but you see, I couldn't. Well, what I'd been saying to them all along... I'm built to always work with other people.'</p> <p>What do you get from them?</p> <p>'Points of reference. Otherwise, I'd just go off in lala land and then I don't know where I am, what I'm doing. It all becomes meaningless. Because I'll get bored or frustrated. My running joke with myself is like being one of those ad executives: you know, the ideas man, the painfully annoying neurotic ones who run around banging loads of charlie and coming up with one idea a month? That sort of thing.'</p> <p>Kid A is the one of the first albums to make good use of the CD format. In the days of vinyl, artists were limited to 45 minutes worth of music, split down the middle. CDs have made it possible for records to grow enormously in length, beyond what many of us are prepared or able to take on in a single sitting. As a result, we skip about, consume in byte-size chunks, much as we do in so many other areas of our lives: as the author James Gleick points out in his book Faster: The Acceleration of Just About Everything, we are gradually losing the ability to relax and focus on one thing for any length of time.</p> <p>To be appreciated in the initial stages, Kid A demands to be heard continuously, as a piece, in the same way that much classical music does. If this care, or rather desire, is not there on the part of the listener, it gives little of itself away. But under the right circumstances, when it does, it turns out to be the equal and more of its predecessors.</p> <p>From the opening strains of 'Everything In Its Right Place', with its elliptical piano motif and mantra-like vocal, to the near devotional hush of 'Motion Picture Soundtrack' at the end, this is a record which constantly surprises with its emotional range and beauty. As if to underscore the point, Radiohead are refusing to release any singles from it, or make videos. In future, they say, they may choose to issue material as and when it's ready, over the internet, thus avoiding the bi-annual marketing putsch.</p> <p>How do you think Kid A is going to be received? I asked Yorke</p> <p>'I think people should just decide for themselves and we'll be getting on with something else. That's about it. No other feelings. If people have a problem with it, well, I wont be reading about it anyway. And I won't be apologising for it. You can't make music and then be responsible for the way that people receive it all the time. [Sarcastically] Not unless you really know your market.'</p> <p>Is the title a reference to Carl Steadman's book, Kid A in Alphabet Street?</p> <p>'No. It just seemed to work. I think the best ones are usually like that. Often, if you call it something specific, it drives the record in a certain way. I like the non-meaning. All sorts of bizarre things have come up in relation to it. But the one I like is based on the idea that, somewhere, some errant scientist has already created the first completely genetically cloned baba - Kid A. I'm sure its happened. I'm sure somewhere it's already been done, even though it's illegal now.'</p> <p>Colin was saying that you and the others all have what he characterised as a middle-class aversion to altercation.</p> <p>'Well, I think a lot of that is... I guess in a way... we were all brought up in kind of an... those sort of schools are ultra, ultra competitive. And you never really lose it. Like that bloke in Big Brother - he says, having not watched it.'</p> <p>Nasty Nick?</p> <p>'I absolutely recognised him. And you look at him and think, \"You absolute arsehole.\" But then you think, \"No I was brought up like that.\" Achievement is everything and if anybody gets in the way you just want to kill. I think there was quite a lot of that and... that was one of the things we had to sort out, really! Cos it couldn't carry on like that... like if you were a businessman and every time you didn't get your own way, you got really vindictive with the people involved, then...'</p> <p>You were inclined to do that?</p> <p>'Oh yeah. Big time. Because I felt like... it's a weird thing because if you have something in your head and it feels like its going there, then suddenly it's being dragged away by other people, you freak. Because, essentially, in order for me personally to stay OK about what I do I have to see through whatever it is that's appearing in my head. That's my instinct, anyway, but then the best things are often those that go somewhere you weren't expecting. It's learning to trust to that. The whole point of being in a band and having Nigel [Godrich] produce us is that things happen that I don't know anything about. And the best feeling in the world is when you sit there and watch it go somewhere unexpected. 'How to Disappear' on Kid A , for instance, I had no involvement in that at all after the demo stage. Jonny did everything else. We managed to turn it into this incredible thing. I think that was good for me to see that happen and to let it happen.'</p> <p>Are you still surprised by what comes out of Radiohead?</p> <p>'Oh yeah. That's the qualification for a song that goes on the record. Each one has had that happen to it. That's the best thing in the world. It's why I keep doing it.'</p> <p>Spitting Image once did a skit on Orson Welles, under the title of 'The man who lived his life backwards'. Now look at this. What about the band who started out with an understated, little-understood album of opaque but brilliant songs, which John Peel loved, then went on to a critically acclaimed middle period, culminating in the big corporate sell-out and success in America with a compromised album at the end. Now look at that backwards. It's Radiohead, isn't it? What do you say to these people? Except, perhaps, 'this is pretty cool, huh huh huh...'</p>",

Butthead: 'This is pretty cool.' Beavis: 'Yeah yeah yeah yeah.' Butthead: 'Uh?...Uhh?' [The soft guitars return.] Beavis: 'What... what's going on...? How come they don't just, like, play that cool part through the whole song?' Butthead: 'Well, Beavis, if they didn't have, like, a part of the song that sucked, then, it's like, the other part wouldn't be as cool.' Beavis: 'Really? You're pretty smart Butthead. Hey, here it comes again. Yes! Yes! Raaawk...!' By the end, they've observed that the singer seems a little low on self-esteem and have helpfully struck up a chant of 'I am somebody, I am somebody'. They are sending up Radiohead, five sallow public schoolboys from Oxford, and they will be neither the first nor the last. Back home, the single which broke them in the US, 'Creep', sank without trace on the first occasion of its release. The NME called them 'a lily-livered excuse for a rock band' ('and they may have had a point,' affable guitarist Ed O'Brien allows late one night in a Parisian hotel bar, seven years later). They were dismissed as a corporate-funded Nirvana-lite and eclipsed by the arrival of Suede, a home-grown rebuke to American grunge, who presaged Britpop and had everything Radiohead didn't; a clear raison d' \u00eatre, a great first album and the support of the press. And Suede had a sexy singer. If John Osborne had been born 30 years after he was, there is no question he'd have chosen rock'n'roll over the theatre, and if you imagine the adenoidal playwright modified with a few genes from Richard III, you have the public face of Radiohead's singer circa 1993. Thom Yorke was born in October 1968, with the muscles in his left eye paralysed, a condition which demanded no less than five operations before the age of six. It can still be the case that when he turns his head to the side and fixes you with his cornflower-blue right eye, his left appears to be glaring at someone on the other side of the room, who's annoying him even more than you are. Strangely, this gives him a kind of presence and may be what drummer Phil Selway is referring to when he says that Yorke 'was very noticeable and always stood out in a crowd' at school. Needless to say, the singer was teased mercilessly when young and could be forgiven for being in a funk with the world, which he learnt from an early age to vent through his music. He was a fighter at school and there is often an undercurrent of rage and frustration in even his most reflective lyrics. He confirms that he still gets hate mail from fans he upset during his last tour. 'Being in a band is about wreaking revenge on the world,' he once conceded. 'It's like when you get chucked by your first girlfriend. You just say to yourself: \"I'm going to be famous one day, and she'll regret that...\"' Now we find Thom Yorke standing on a stage, inside a huge blue tent, with lights skittering across the angled surfaces above him and 10,000 rapt Parisians gazing at him from below. In the early days, you'd have got long odds on Radiohead being here, with two seminal albums under their belts, in the form of The Bends (1995) and OK Computer (1997). You'd have got longer odds on their fourth album, Kid A, which is released tomorrow, sparking the kind of critical discussion which hasn't been heard since the two European groups who changed pop - the Beatles and Kraftwerk - were at their peaks. Some critics are calling it a commercial suicide note. This is the second of two Parisian dates on a short European tour which involves two different tents leapfrogging each other across the continent. It's an enormous production and all the dates are sold out. At this particular moment toward the end of the show, Yorke is the only real focus. His voice brings to mind an angel being attacked by a swarm of bees and he spins a melody the way a spider spins a web, gossamer and intricate, allowing it to drift across a jackhammer electro beat which makes the floor judder and your scalp tingle. As lights strobe and guitarists O'Brien and Jonny Greenwood help to propel the song towards an urgent crescendo, Yorke starts to shudder and squirm as though someone's plugged him into the mains, as though caught up in religious ecstasy. It's an extraordinary moment and I've only ever heard a more fevered response to something a band has done once before - and Take That only had to walk on stage at Wembley to elicit that. The song is 'Idioteque' and tonight's audience have never heard it before, or anything like it. It's the eighth tune on Kid A and the most striking result of a creative crisis that afflicted the group and has taken the better part of two turbulent years to resolve. The trouble began with OK Computer, which is regarded, with a degree of unanimity as the finest British rock album of the past decade (closely followed by The Bends). In its wake, the quintet were obliged to tour for a full 12 months, a process which they had been through with The Bends and nearly failed to recover from. This time, Yorke came back disenchanted with the guitar music he had been making and resolved to change it. Melody, he has said, came to seem like 'an embarrassment'. He wanted the emphasis to switch to rhythm. 'I just wasn't interested in guitar music anymore,' he will tell me, going on to deny any suggestions that bravery was involved in tearing Radiohead down and starting over again, saying, 'Yeah, but things were being torn down anyway. That's how I felt. There was no being brave. It was \"I either do this or forget it. Just stop.\"' The frightening thing, Yorke will add, is that he saw no way out. He had always been the catalyst for Radiohead and there was no one else to take up the reins now. ('We operate like the UN,' he told one interviewer drily, 'and I'm America.') In February 1999, the five members convened in Paris for a month during which almost nothing was achieved. The same thing happened in Copenhagen later, during which time each individual member had begun to have doubts as to whether the less traditional, less methodical approach the singer was trying to foist on them could ever work - and even if it did, whether there would be a place for them within it. Yorke had played in a techno group called Flickernoise while studying art and English at Exeter University, but the electronic artists he was holding up as pointers to the way forward now (such as The Aphex Twin and Autechre) mostly worked on their own or in pairs. Nothing was happening and the band was insecure. On some of the tracks, none of them were being asked to contribute directly at all. Only three of the 10 pieces that would eventually comprise Kid A have any obvious guitar parts on them. Selway was not alone in realising that they had been together for 15 years and were essentially the same schoolboy band they'd started out as. But they weren't schoolboys anymore. Tensions rose until a series of blazing rows led to an acknowledgment that there was space for them all, even though they might not be playing their usual instruments on every track, and earlier this year the album began to take shape. The group were reputedly close to splitting up again in February over the issue of whether to pour all of the 23 tracks they'd recorded on to a double album, or whittle it down to a concise single disc. Once the brooding, piano-driven 'Everything In Its Right Place' had been chosen to open proceedings, the rest of the sequence followed naturally. At only 48 minutes long, Kid A was conceived of, and sounds like, a unitary piece of work, rather than a collection of songs. Radiohead will admit to eschewing photo shoots partly because they look so peculiar together. They range in height from Yorke's flyweight 5'7\", to Ed O'Brien's hulking 6'5\", and in age from drummer Selway's 33 to Jonny Greenwood's boyish 28. They met at Abingdon school in the Oxford suburbs and, Yorke excepted, are as articulate and easy-going a crew as you could hope to find anywhere. I met the brothers Jonny and Colin Greenwood (guitar and bass, respectively) in a north London restaurant, where we chatted amiably about the obvious things, along with history (which Colin read at Peterhouse College, Cambridge), books and music. Jonny was at his most animated when describing the influence of composers Penderecki and Messiaen on his string arrangements for OK Computer and Kid A and Colin explained Radiohead's attitude to fame and success in a way that was unusually comprehensible. 'I think, as long as you keep moving, you're all right,' he said. 'The thing is you're always developing and expanding. It's a protean thing and a public image can't keep pace with it. So it - the process of success - is like this slow-drying glue that sets around you, that slows you down and gums you up. And while all that's happening, your own life's going on at the side of it, with your own relationships and your own experiences and that becomes sort of calcified as well. And the whole thing just grinds to a halt really. And then you suddenly find yourself in the paper or on the cover of a magazine and your life and experiences have become summarised. And once its summarised, its over. So the trick is to try to be in the corner of people's vision, but not full on.' How much do you feel like rock stars, I'd asked? There had been a wary pause, before Jonny pitched in with 'I don't know. It feels like Radiohead are famous. But that no one knows who we are. Which is brilliant, really.' By the time we sit down to talk on the train from Paris to London, Thom Yorke has been a thorn in my side for several days. On the whole, he doesn't talk to the British press, because he feels misunderstood and misrepresented by them. He is annoyed by the accusations of miserabalism and implications that he is a spoilt middle-class charlatan. On the latter, he is vituperative. 'The middle-class thing has never been relevant,' he spits. 'We live in Oxford, and in Oxford we're fucking lower class. The place is full of the most obnoxious, self-indulgent, self-righteous oiks on the fucking planet, and for us to be called middle class... well, no, actually. Be around on May Day when they all reel out of the pubs at five in the morning puking up and going \"haw haw haw\" and trying to hassle your girlfriend...' He has also been irked by assumptions that a song like 'Exit Music (For A Film)' from OK Computer is about suicide, and that an early number like Anyone Can Play Guitar is a sardonic swipe at the vacuity of being in a band, when it was intended as an innocent celebration. Phil Selway has protested that 'I've always seen our songs as being quite positive. They confront very painful topics, but at some time there's always a sense that there's a struggle with them and an attempt to overcome them.' Yorke, too, considers that he worked through a lot of his post-adolescent angst on the patchy first album, Pablo Honey, and changed through the making of The Bends, at which time he realised that 'there's a fine line between writing something with genuine emotional impact and turning into little idiots feeling sorry for ourselves and playing stadium rock'. The lyrics for Kid A will not be printed on the sleeve and Yorke has resisted even explaining them to the band. A few, like the refrain of 'You can try the best you can/ you can try the best you can/ the best you can is good enough' - a piece of advice his girlfriend frequently offers him - on 'Optimistic', seem self-evident. Most do not. He describes the indiscernible words to the whispering electronic title track as 'the most vicious I've ever sung'. Yorke has been avoiding me to a degree that has begun to assume comic proportions and I'm marvelling at the extent to which people come to resemble their persecutors after a time, when word arrives that he will talk. When I finally settle into a seat opposite him, I find him disarmingly friendly, even warm. He smiles and laughs a lot, turning out to have a keen sense of humour. I ask why he is so fearful of these situations and he explains that he doesn't like having to answer for something that someone else has written. He no longer reads anything about himself, not even reviews of his records. We return to the turmoil that descended on Kid A. 'When we finished the OK Computer tour, I had a sort of big... block. I basically thought that was it. I thought that I wouldn't be able to do whatever it is that I do again. We were still sort of working, but I had no faith in it. So I was in this endless cycle - and it was very much on my own as well, because we didn't see each other much for awhile. And I was doing bits and pieces, mucking around really. But in the process I was discovering that I'd lost all confidence in myself.' Why? You had just made two critically and commercially successful albums. What more did you want? 'Yeah, but if you've lost faith in the way that you're going, then that's where you end up. I always used to use music as a way of moving on and dealing with things and I sort of felt like, that the thing that helped me deal with things had been sold to the highest bidder and I was simply doing its bidding. And I couldn't handle that. And that was all sort of wrapped up with feeling huge amounts of guilt about something that, when it was good, just came naturally anyway. So it all just went round and round in circles for ages. So there's no bravado about we're gonna shake this shit up, really. It's more like, I can't carry on like this.' Do you have any sympathy with the idea that rock has run its course and there's nothing left to do but trot out the tired cliches? 'Oh yeah, absolutely. Totally. I 100 per cent agree with it.' But Radiohead are regarded as one of the few groups capable of taking it anywhere new. 'God help us if we are. The thing I have a problem with is the fact that so much of what people - of what journalists - term rock music now is really not based on the music itself, but based on the lifestyle that goes with it. It's like a lifestyle choice... That doesn't mean that people should stop using drums and guitars, but why stand up and say, \"I'm a rock star - in 10 years time I'm going to get fucked up on smack...\" The mythology around it has run its course and is stale and uncreative now, and it has been destroying the people who've been trying to make the music. 'I worry about that in the context of the album we've just done, as well. I absolutely want no part in any suggestions that our decision to use some electronic instruments is some kind of lifestyle choice. It's not. You use the instrument to help you get across a certain thing that you want to get across. That's all.' But haven't you often been hostage to the belief that you need to be in a state of turmoil to be creative? 'No. No, I dealt with that one. I think the turmoil that is required is one that you can find any day walking down the street. I don't think you need to go and seek it out. Any normal human being goes through states of flux which they need to resolve by talking to people or making their art or whatever.' Would it be true to say that you have a generally pessimistic caste of mind, though? 'No. I don't think so.' That's certainly your reputation. 'Yeah, whatever. It depends what it's about. No I don't think like that at all, actually. For me, even when things are incredibly bleak in terms of the world you see reflected in the newspaper, I still sort of find you can get excited when you look in people's eyes when they walk down the street and sometimes you see really nasty, terrifying things, but most of the time you just see a bunch of people trying to get it together and there's something really hopeful in that. It sounds a bit bonkers, but there you go.' You've found touring tiresome and destructive in the past. Having seen it as close quarters, I'm constantly surprised that anyone with a modicum of sensitivity and/or intelligence survives that life for more than a year. 'I don't think they do. I think they either step out, or they go pop.' Have you felt close to doing either of those things? 'Oh, I did go pop.' He smiles broadly and gazes out of the window, chuckling. 'I definitely went pop.' How did this 'pop' manifest itself? 'Oh it was a fairly quiet little pop, really. I was really... I saw this really cheesy Bruce Lee film, the story of his life. And there's this bit in it where he's standing between two mirrors and there's this break and he goes nuts and he has a seizure. Well it was like that without the seizure. It was just on and off really. I mean it wasn't like... it was just a state of mind. But in a way it was just kind of not knowing how to deal with it. And I look back now and I'm really quite happy that it happened, because it makes you decide what to do and then go on that path for awhile. And then you sort of pick yourself up and you carry on and you feel so much better that you've done it. It feels like I'm a little bit tougher than I was. I have more confidence. 'I got really into these hawthorn hedges in the woods near where I live. The way the branches weave together reminds me of a human brain and I love the way that the rain flows along them and the life that's lived in them - it's like this path you choose to take and it gets thinner at the end. And I used to draw these things endlessly, for weeks on end, I used to go sit in the woods and draw these trees. I still do it.' Did your friends stick by you through what sounds like a breakdown of some kind? 'They were brilliant. Even when I was being a bastard , they were really cool about it. That's when you find out... and that's another cliche. What I should really be doing is wearing a cowboy hat...' Do you think the rest of the band is secure with your new recording methods now? You could work alone if you wanted to. 'No, but you see, I couldn't. Well, what I'd been saying to them all along... I'm built to always work with other people.' What do you get from them? 'Points of reference. Otherwise, I'd just go off in lala land and then I don't know where I am, what I'm doing. It all becomes meaningless. Because I'll get bored or frustrated. My running joke with myself is like being one of those ad executives: you know, the ideas man, the painfully annoying neurotic ones who run around banging loads of charlie and coming up with one idea a month? That sort of thing.' Kid A is the one of the first albums to make good use of the CD format. In the days of vinyl, artists were limited to 45 minutes worth of music, split down the middle. CDs have made it possible for records to grow enormously in length, beyond what many of us are prepared or able to take on in a single sitting. As a result, we skip about, consume in byte-size chunks, much as we do in so many other areas of our lives: as the author James Gleick points out in his book Faster: The Acceleration of Just About Everything, we are gradually losing the ability to relax and focus on one thing for any length of time. To be appreciated in the initial stages, Kid A demands to be heard continuously, as a piece, in the same way that much classical music does. If this care, or rather desire, is not there on the part of the listener, it gives little of itself away. But under the right circumstances, when it does, it turns out to be the equal and more of its predecessors. From the opening strains of 'Everything In Its Right Place', with its elliptical piano motif and mantra-like vocal, to the near devotional hush of 'Motion Picture Soundtrack' at the end, this is a record which constantly surprises with its emotional range and beauty. As if to underscore the point, Radiohead are refusing to release any singles from it, or make videos. In future, they say, they may choose to issue material as and when it's ready, over the internet, thus avoiding the bi-annual marketing putsch. How do you think Kid A is going to be received? I asked Yorke 'I think people should just decide for themselves and we'll be getting on with something else. That's about it. No other feelings. If people have a problem with it, well, I wont be reading about it anyway. And I won't be apologising for it. You can't make music and then be responsible for the way that people receive it all the time. [Sarcastically] Not unless you really know your market.' Is the title a reference to Carl Steadman's book, Kid A in Alphabet Street? 'No. It just seemed to work. I think the best ones are usually like that. Often, if you call it something specific, it drives the record in a certain way. I like the non-meaning. All sorts of bizarre things have come up in relation to it. But the one I like is based on the idea that, somewhere, some errant scientist has already created the first completely genetically cloned baba - Kid A. I'm sure its happened. I'm sure somewhere it's already been done, even though it's illegal now.' Colin was saying that you and the others all have what he characterised as a middle-class aversion to altercation. 'Well, I think a lot of that is... I guess in a way... we were all brought up in kind of an... those sort of schools are ultra, ultra competitive. And you never really lose it. Like that bloke in Big Brother - he says, having not watched it.' Nasty Nick? 'I absolutely recognised him. And you look at him and think, \"You absolute arsehole.\" But then you think, \"No I was brought up like that.\" Achievement is everything and if anybody gets in the way you just want to kill. I think there was quite a lot of that and... that was one of the things we had to sort out, really! Cos it couldn't carry on like that... like if you were a businessman and every time you didn't get your own way, you got really vindictive with the people involved, then...' You were inclined to do that? 'Oh yeah. Big time. Because I felt like... it's a weird thing because if you have something in your head and it feels like its going there, then suddenly it's being dragged away by other people, you freak. Because, essentially, in order for me personally to stay OK about what I do I have to see through whatever it is that's appearing in my head. That's my instinct, anyway, but then the best things are often those that go somewhere you weren't expecting. It's learning to trust to that. The whole point of being in a band and having Nigel [Godrich] produce us is that things happen that I don't know anything about. And the best feeling in the world is when you sit there and watch it go somewhere unexpected. 'How to Disappear' on Kid A , for instance, I had no involvement in that at all after the demo stage. Jonny did everything else. We managed to turn it into this incredible thing. I think that was good for me to see that happen and to let it happen.' Are you still surprised by what comes out of Radiohead? 'Oh yeah. That's the qualification for a song that goes on the record. Each one has had that happen to it. That's the best thing in the world. It's why I keep doing it.' Spitting Image once did a skit on Orson Welles, under the title of 'The man who lived his life backwards'. Now look at this. What about the band who started out with an understated, little-understood album of opaque but brilliant songs, which John Peel loved, then went on to a critically acclaimed middle period, culminating in the big corporate sell-out and success in America with a compromised album at the end. Now look at that backwards. It's Radiohead, isn't it? What do you say to these people? Except, perhaps, 'this is pretty cool, huh huh huh...'",

      "body": "<p><strong>Dear Jane, I have been suffering painful periods for the past five years, so my doctor has suggested I start taking the pill. I have some reservations, however, as I believe that the pill has some side effects, such as thrush. Is there anything that can be done through nutrition to minimise these?</strong></p> <p>This letter is typical of many I receive. And although taking the pill will probably alleviate period pain, it can cause side effects including thrush, fluid retention, raised blood pressure and blood clots in the legs, as well as the more worrying and well-documented increased risk of developing cancer of the cervix, breast and liver. These will be exacerbated if you smoke or are overweight. Recently, I've had several queries over the link between the pill and cancer, particularly of the breast, liver and cervix. But according to the Cancer Research Campaign, there doesn't seem to be a cause for concern, especially in women taking the pill for less than 10 years. The old pill and cancer scares were based on women taking pills with a far higher oestrogen content than is currently prescribed. If you're at all worried about side effects, discuss them with your doctor. </p> <p>I've identified seven common side effects that might be experienced when the pill's artificial hormones are introduced into the body. Here are some nutritional strategies to help counter them. </p> <p> <strong> 1. Weight gain </strong> Many women develop an insatiable hunger when they start taking the pill, especially for sweet foods. Drinking a glass of water instead of reaching for some food is the first strategy to try. Eating slowly and ensuring your diet includes plenty of fibre-containing fruits and vegetables will also help to make you feel full. Try eating smaller meals more often and make sure you really concentrate on the eating experience. Also learn to differentiate between physiological and psychological hunger pangs, and don't give into the latter. If you follow these guidelines, you shouldn't gain weight through food, although you may start to retain extra fluid. </p> <p> <strong> 2. Depression </strong> It is common for women to feel down when they start taking the pill. This is due to changes in the way the brain manufactures such endorphins - or 'happy hormones' - as serotonin and noradrenaline. Eating more vitamin C-rich fruits, along with lean sources of protein (chicken, smoked salmon, etc) can help your body to correct any imbalance. Avoid overly sweet foods, however, which can aggravate depression in the long run. </p> <p> <strong> 3. Fluid retention </strong> If your body starts retaining fluid, the following nutritional tips may help to disperse it: </p> <p>\u0095 Keep your salt intake down. </p> <p>\u0095 Eat more potassium-rich foods (including all fresh vegetables, but green, leafy vegetables in particular, along with bananas, tomatoes and oranges). </p> <p>\u0095 Drink 2.5l of water every day to help your body to dilute the salt in its tissues and enable it to excrete more salt and fluid. </p> <p>\u0095 Regulate your intake of alcoholic drinks and drinks containing caffeine. </p> <p> <strong> 4. Bacterial infections </strong> The pill can disturb the healthy bacterial balance of the gut (causing it to become bloated or painful) and vagina (sometimes leading to thrush). Try countering this with the following steps: </p> <p>\u0095 Take a daily dose of either a small pot of live yogurt containing lactobacillus or bifidus, or a pill containing acidiphilus. </p> <p>\u0095 Boost your intake of yeast-suppressing foods, such as fresh vegetables, garlic and olive oil. </p> <p>\u0095 Eat more zinc- and iron-rich foods to discourage the growth of candida. </p> <p>\u0095 Over a period of a couple of weeks, try sticking to a diet that is low in yeast and sugar - including white flour, brown or white sugar, Marmite, cheese, fruits that haven't been peeled, raisins and sultanas, grapes, grape juice and alcohol. Making your body a yeast-free zone will take effort, but can be very effective in clearing up pill-related thrush. If this doesn't work, however, you may need an anti-fungal medication, which your doctor can prescribe. Once the levels of candida in your vagina have diminished, resume a balanced diet. </p> <p> <strong> 5. Vitamin B deficiencies </strong> Many studies have been carried out on the effects of oral contraceptives on the body, particularly of its oestrogen component on the body's stores of tryptophan and vitamin B6, deficiencies of which can aggravate depression. There is also evidence to suggest that the pill depletes the body's stock, and metabolisation, of vitamin B1, causing irritability, disturbed sleeping patterns and fatigue. It is, therefore, important that you boost your intake of foods containing the B group of vitamins, including dairy produce, eggs, lean red meat, wholegrain cereals and dark-green, leafy vegetables. </p> <p> <strong> 6. Folic-acid and zinc deficiencies </strong> Folic acid is a powerful antioxidant that has been shown to decrease the risk of pregnant women having babies with neural-tube defects, such as spina bifida. Folic acid also helps our bodies to absorb iron and other essential nutrients that are vital for maintaining healthy blood. Because the pill disrupts the body's folic-acid status, you should replenish its stores by eating plenty of foods that are packed with this B vitamin, including fresh orange juice and green, leafy vegetables. </p> <p>Zinc deficiency, which is also associated with oral-contraceptive usage, compromises the body's ability to absorb folic acid, too, and may furthermore have a negative impact on the libido and immune system. You can compensate for this by eating zinc-rich foods, including seafood, canned sardines, turkey, lean red meat, hard cheeses and wholegrain cereals. </p> <p> <strong> 7. Protect the heart </strong> Because taking the pill can increase the risk of high blood pressure, it is advisable to reduce other heart-disease risk factors, such as high cholesterol levels. It is also good to eat anti-oxidant containing fruits and vegetables.</p>",
