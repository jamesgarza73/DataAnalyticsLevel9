Boethius personified Philosophy as a grave, majestic maiden, but otherwise kept her untouchably abstract. De Botton embodies the goddess. He imagines Philosophy lolling in an apartment on the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9 in Paris and garbing herself in Agn\u00e9s B.

A youth does sit-ups on his instructor's penis, no doubt imbibing wisdom in the process. </p> <p>The wry manner is essential to de Botton's undertaking, which attempts, 'a task at once profound and laughable: to become wise through philosophy'. The laughter is his cautionary reminder that comedy can reconcile us to the abiding contradictions and unexpected mishaps of life by relieving us of the need to think. </p> <p>De Botton venerates the common sense of unlettered people, who won't read his book because they don't need to.

Shere Hite - sheer hype, we say. Sheer shite. We smirk, as if she's a slightly smutty joke. We don't take her seriously; can't. For decades, she's been soldiering away, a dogged feminist pioneer researching the very literal details of male and female sexuality, sending out tens of thousands of questionnaires, sitting in her room with statistics and pie-charts, asking questions that nobody had presumed to ask before. </p> <p>People were aghast at her findings, yet time and again she has been proved right. While in the Seventies, other feminists were campaigning for the right to work, to be equal with men in the public world, Hite was campaigning for the right to have pleasure. She was meticulously and repetitively fascinated by the internal workings of bodies, the hidden labyrinths of desire. So do we snigger at her because of her subject matter - sex and sexual inadequacy, mapped out, tracked in graphs, dissected into tables, hung out in percentages - or because she's famously been, in her early days, a model who appeared semi-naked in Playboy? And she's beautiful in an odd and almost spooky way - her gaunt, planed cheeks, wide-apart eyes, ghostly pallor and stark, red lips. Her face looks haunted, almost unreal. </p> <p>So there she is, with her two degrees, her training as a researcher, her intense focus on the clinical aspects of pleasure, her undoubted dedication and hard work, her commitment to other women and the women's movement. And we see, instead, a thin, beautiful, needy, foolish, splendid, lonely woman. Look at my work, she says, and we look at her body, her hunched shoulders, her painful life. </p> <p>Hite says that her autobiography is her final act of writing before moving on to other things. It was written in Germany, where she now lives after being virtually hounded out of America. In a preface so childishly self-important as to be almost touching, she invites her readers to 'see here how a woman came to be who she is and who she is still becoming - imperfect, full of shyness, self-consciousness, fear and pride, but somehow achieving a lot of what she wants. And hopefully having a positive impact on the world!' </p> <p>Scratch the surface of this learnt self-esteem and you find a deeply anxious woman, an orphan, the 'daughter in exile' who never had a mother. The autobiography takes us from her childhood, when she was abandoned by her parents, brought up by her beloved grandparents and then her aunt; through her student and modelling days; her dawning feminism; the first few years of sexual research; the brouhaha when she published the first Hite Report; meeting the love of her life, husband Friedrich; the vitriolic abuse for the Hite Report on Women and Love and the media smears she's endured; her escape to Germany. </p> <p>Much of the book is written in a breathless 'what I did on my holiday' style. Occasionally, when she is remembering her self as a shy and motherless little girl, there are soft and graceful touches.

Authenticity is difficult and self-knowing; sincerity may be genuine and yet easy and self-deluding. Hite is very sincere; she struggles to find authenticity. She tends to remember her life in snapshots (often she literally looks at photographs of herself and remembers that scene: eating peaches, playing with dolls, feeding chickens). She insists on casting a golden light over the whole of her childhood. She played in an Eden, was loved and looked after. </p> <p>Never mind that her father left her, that her mother left her. Never mind that her adored grandfather left her grandmother. That her grandmother would hit her. That when she was a teenager she was shipped off to her aunt. There is no room for anger, only for a kind of terrified and terrifying sweetness. She was a good girl. And this scared good girl haunts the book. It is the good girl who wants us to understand that she is not the Shere Hite the media give us, the Playboy model, the loony. It is the good girl who stays up night after night slogging away at her thankless task. </p> <p>She is not playing at feminism. She is serious. A researcher. A scholar. She really wants to help, to make the world a better place. And she has courage. It takes courage for a good girl to be disobedient in the way she has been; to be stoical like her; to face the world's sneers and not give up. In feminism, you sense she found a home, or glimpsed its possibility.

She partly realises this herself (she calls her life before Friedrich a 'semi-sleep' and a 'cocoon'), yet she insists that now she has broken out of that, become transformed. I hope so, for there is something touching and splendid about her. </p> <p>I interviewed her once. She sat in a crowded, cynical Groucho Club and spoke very loudly for an hour about the real size of the internal clitoris; she drew large diagrams on napkins and held them up. I didn't want her to whisper, but why did she have to shout? Her autobiography helps me to understand why she had to shout - not to shock, but to be good, brave, real.</p>",

We smirk, as if she's a slightly smutty joke. We don't take her seriously; can't. For decades, she's been soldiering away, a dogged feminist pioneer researching the very literal details of male and female sexuality, sending out tens of thousands of questionnaires, sitting in her room with statistics and pie-charts, asking questions that nobody had presumed to ask before. People were aghast at her findings, yet time and again she has been proved right. While in the Seventies, other feminists were campaigning for the right to work, to be equal with men in the public world, Hite was campaigning for the right to have pleasure. She was meticulously and repetitively fascinated by the internal workings of bodies, the hidden labyrinths of desire. So do we snigger at her because of her subject matter - sex and sexual inadequacy, mapped out, tracked in graphs, dissected into tables, hung out in percentages - or because she's famously been, in her early days, a model who appeared semi-naked in Playboy? And she's beautiful in an odd and almost spooky way - her gaunt, planed cheeks, wide-apart eyes, ghostly pallor and stark, red lips. Her face looks haunted, almost unreal. So there she is, with her two degrees, her training as a researcher, her intense focus on the clinical aspects of pleasure, her undoubted dedication and hard work, her commitment to other women and the women's movement. And we see, instead, a thin, beautiful, needy, foolish, splendid, lonely woman. Look at my work, she says, and we look at her body, her hunched shoulders, her painful life. Hite says that her autobiography is her final act of writing before moving on to other things. It was written in Germany, where she now lives after being virtually hounded out of America. In a preface so childishly self-important as to be almost touching, she invites her readers to 'see here how a woman came to be who she is and who she is still becoming - imperfect, full of shyness, self-consciousness, fear and pride, but somehow achieving a lot of what she wants.

      "body": "<p><strong> Laura Blundy</strong><br>Julie Myerson<br>Fourth Estate \u00a315.99, pp263</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502365756,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>Laura Blundy is instantly recognisable as a Julie Myerson heroine. Like Amy, the narrator of Myerson's previous novel, Me and the Fat Man, Laura possesses the same frankness, the same unsettling ability to describe the baser side of life, unselfconsciously and without squeamishness, as though oblivious to the unspoken rule that femininity means pretending not to notice the brutal and the disgusting. Just as Amy, in the opening scene of Me and the Fat Man, unflinchingly describes the 'fish stink' of a punter's cock, so Laura Blundy begins her story with a matter-of-fact account of beating her husband to death: 'Blood runs fast from his head. The air's hot - sweet and sticky. I need the WC. It's bad timing, that I should be coming on the rag just now.' </p> <p>Laura Blundy is set in Victorian London, a starkly unsanitised world that provides Myerson with ample opportunity to articulate raw physical discomfort. There are noxious fogs and damp from the river, open sewers, starving, big-eyed children with running sores, foulness, filth and disease everywhere.</p> <p>Laura has seen all of this at first hand. As her narrative darts back and forth in time, she offers glimpses of her history in pieces that the reader must fit together like a puzzle - life as a homeless beggar or an inmate in Tatum Fields prison; the accident that crushed her leg and her subsequent marriage to Ewan, the surgeon who performed the amputation; her rape at 14 and the baby she gave up to the Foundling Hospital, whose soiled blanket she clings to obsessively; her passionate affair with Billy, 15 years younger than her and already the father of five children, for whose sake she crushes Ewan's skull with a marble ornament. </p> <p>Myerson's narrators are disturbing because they retain in many ways the qualities of childhood: plainness of speech and scatalogical fascination bound up with innocence. Laura shows the same kind of wide-eyed curiosity about the world - its ugliness as well as its rare moments of beauty - as Amy displays in her casual prostitution in Me and the Fat Man. The language is often childish - 'Well, we walked around a bit and I chose the smallest, drabbest bird I could find that was making the shoutiest noise' - but most disturbing is the way her voice barely modulates over the course of the book. The grim business of disposing of her husband's body is described in the same open, interested, almost jaunty tone as the trip to the bird market at Epping Forest, suggesting a kind of equivalence, a frightening absence of moral conscience. </p> <p>Ewan points this out succinctly before their marriage: 'You are not human. You do not bleed or wince or cry. Nothing can touch you - there is a part of you missing. You scare me - do you know that?' </p> <p>There is, of course, quite literally a part of Laura missing, but the physical amputation of her leg works as a symbol for a much more wrenching loss - the denial of motherhood. Laura still nurses a heartbreaking passion for her baby boy, whom she believes to have died in the foundling hospital, and this is the force that drives her: 'They infect you, children do. They get in your bones.' When it becomes clear that her young lover, Billy, was himself abandoned at the same hospital, and is the same age as Laura's son would have been, the reader may feel that they have predicted the novel's d\u00e9nouement. But Myerson is more complex than this, and the book's ending is subtler and stranger than could have been guessed. But it is also baffling. </p> <p>After such a physical book, a story with such overt emphasis on bodies - blood, bone, flesh, sex, birth, death - elemental and solid, this incorporeal, supernatural conclusion is unsatisfying. Though it forces the reader back to the beginning to re-evaluate and unravel everything that has gone before, ultimately it feels quite wrong, as if the author has chosen an easy way out. Such a compelling and carefully detailed novel deserved a more convincing finale.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Laura Blundy Julie Myerson Fourth Estate \u00a315.99, pp263 Buy it at BOL Laura Blundy is instantly recognisable as a Julie Myerson heroine. Like Amy, the narrator of Myerson's previous novel, Me and the Fat Man, Laura possesses the same frankness, the same unsettling ability to describe the baser side of life, unselfconsciously and without squeamishness, as though oblivious to the unspoken rule that femininity means pretending not to notice the brutal and the disgusting. Just as Amy, in the opening scene of Me and the Fat Man, unflinchingly describes the 'fish stink' of a punter's cock, so Laura Blundy begins her story with a matter-of-fact account of beating her husband to death: 'Blood runs fast from his head. The air's hot - sweet and sticky. I need the WC. It's bad timing, that I should be coming on the rag just now.' Laura Blundy is set in Victorian London, a starkly unsanitised world that provides Myerson with ample opportunity to articulate raw physical discomfort. There are noxious fogs and damp from the river, open sewers, starving, big-eyed children with running sores, foulness, filth and disease everywhere. Laura has seen all of this at first hand. As her narrative darts back and forth in time, she offers glimpses of her history in pieces that the reader must fit together like a puzzle - life as a homeless beggar or an inmate in Tatum Fields prison; the accident that crushed her leg and her subsequent marriage to Ewan, the surgeon who performed the amputation; her rape at 14 and the baby she gave up to the Foundling Hospital, whose soiled blanket she clings to obsessively; her passionate affair with Billy, 15 years younger than her and already the father of five children, for whose sake she crushes Ewan's skull with a marble ornament. Myerson's narrators are disturbing because they retain in many ways the qualities of childhood: plainness of speech and scatalogical fascination bound up with innocence. Laura shows the same kind of wide-eyed curiosity about the world - its ugliness as well as its rare moments of beauty - as Amy displays in her casual prostitution in Me and the Fat Man. The language is often childish - 'Well, we walked around a bit and I chose the smallest, drabbest bird I could find that was making the shoutiest noise' - but most disturbing is the way her voice barely modulates over the course of the book. The grim business of disposing of her husband's body is described in the same open, interested, almost jaunty tone as the trip to the bird market at Epping Forest, suggesting a kind of equivalence, a frightening absence of moral conscience. Ewan points this out succinctly before their marriage: 'You are not human. You do not bleed or wince or cry. Nothing can touch you - there is a part of you missing. You scare me - do you know that?' There is, of course, quite literally a part of Laura missing, but the physical amputation of her leg works as a symbol for a much more wrenching loss - the denial of motherhood. Laura still nurses a heartbreaking passion for her baby boy, whom she believes to have died in the foundling hospital, and this is the force that drives her: 'They infect you, children do. They get in your bones.' When it becomes clear that her young lover, Billy, was himself abandoned at the same hospital, and is the same age as Laura's son would have been, the reader may feel that they have predicted the novel's d\u00e9nouement. But Myerson is more complex than this, and the book's ending is subtler and stranger than could have been guessed. But it is also baffling. After such a physical book, a story with such overt emphasis on bodies - blood, bone, flesh, sex, birth, death - elemental and solid, this incorporeal, supernatural conclusion is unsatisfying. Though it forces the reader back to the beginning to re-evaluate and unravel everything that has gone before, ultimately it feels quite wrong, as if the author has chosen an easy way out. Such a compelling and carefully detailed novel deserved a more convincing finale.",

It's even more of a bastard form than the novel, and makes its way in life as best it can, without anything much in the way of respectable forebears. It's somehow appropriate that the greatest master of the form, Chekhov, came from a lower middle-class family. If he knew nothing much about his roots, literary or social, he could hardly care less. </p> <p>The short story just arrived at some point in the nineteenth century, called into being by the demands of mass-circulation journals. Since then, and despite the effective disappearance of such journals, it has stuck in there. Is it a form, like a sonnet? Is it a genre, like tragedy? Is there, even, as Harold Brodkey intimated, a 'classical mode' for the short story? Is there a difference, as Conrad seems to have thought, between the 'tale' and the 'story'? Surely not. No one has ever managed to understand Conrad's distinction. Surely it is nothing more than an arena, like the novel, dictating nothing more than scale. Into such an arena, anything may enter; within its flexible bounds, anything may happen. </p> <p>When you add to that the fact that short stories are hardly confined by the dictates of scale, it is easy to see that this is the most difficult of forms to generalise about. There are short stories by Henry James, or Chekhov, which are twice as long as whole novels by Firbank; there are others, by Kafka, which run their length in a few lines. Calvino used to cite, with great glee, a minuscule Uruguayan short story. In its entirety, it runs thus: 'When he awoke, the dinosaur was still there.' </p> <p>But, on the whole, the classic short story runs from 5,000-10,000 words, and prefers the single situation to plot-and-subplot entrelacement. Beyond that, it is difficult to generalise. Perhaps, right now, genre has a weaker hold on the short story than it does on the novel; there are fewer writers now producing ghost stories, detective stories, horror stories than there were 50 years ago. Perhaps it has become a more literary form, with the decline of the popular magazine. I think that's a great shame; some of the masterpieces of the English short story are 'genre pieces' - J.G. Ballard's science fiction or M.R. James's ghost stories (not to mention Henry James's). </p> <p>Who, now, is writing anything resembling the sublime genre pieces of Conan Doyle or Chesterton's wonderfully off-the-leash Father Brown stories?

It's even more of a bastard form than the novel, and makes its way in life as best it can, without anything much in the way of respectable forebears. It's somehow appropriate that the greatest master of the form, Chekhov, came from a lower middle-class family. If he knew nothing much about his roots, literary or social, he could hardly care less. The short story just arrived at some point in the nineteenth century, called into being by the demands of mass-circulation journals. Since then, and despite the effective disappearance of such journals, it has stuck in there. Is it a form, like a sonnet? Is it a genre, like tragedy? Is there, even, as Harold Brodkey intimated, a 'classical mode' for the short story? Is there a difference, as Conrad seems to have thought, between the 'tale' and the 'story'? Surely not. No one has ever managed to understand Conrad's distinction. Surely it is nothing more than an arena, like the novel, dictating nothing more than scale. Into such an arena, anything may enter; within its flexible bounds, anything may happen. When you add to that the fact that short stories are hardly confined by the dictates of scale, it is easy to see that this is the most difficult of forms to generalise about. There are short stories by Henry James, or Chekhov, which are twice as long as whole novels by Firbank; there are others, by Kafka, which run their length in a few lines. Calvino used to cite, with great glee, a minuscule Uruguayan short story. In its entirety, it runs thus: 'When he awoke, the dinosaur was still there.' But, on the whole, the classic short story runs from 5,000-10,000 words, and prefers the single situation to plot-and-subplot entrelacement. Beyond that, it is difficult to generalise. Perhaps, right now, genre has a weaker hold on the short story than it does on the novel; there are fewer writers now producing ghost stories, detective stories, horror stories than there were 50 years ago. Perhaps it has become a more literary form, with the decline of the popular magazine. I think that's a great shame; some of the masterpieces of the English short story are 'genre pieces' - J.G. Ballard's science fiction or M.R. James's ghost stories (not to mention Henry James's). Who, now, is writing anything resembling the sublime genre pieces of Conan Doyle or Chesterton's wonderfully off-the-leash Father Brown stories? But, on the whole, it's impossible to diagnose the state of the short story, make any suggestion where it might be going, since it's impossible to say where it has come from. That doesn't stop people trying and The Art of the Story, an enormous anthology, clearly has big ideas.

In Cradle Will Rock, Tim Robbins's hyperactive, Depression-era comedy based on Welles's real-life struggles to stage an agitprop musical, MacFadyen gives a fine performance. The 36-year-old shed 20lb and 15 years to play the theatre wunderkind as a breathless opportunist wrapped in hubris. It's a winningly exuberant performance, yet stardom is likely to remain elusive. </p> <p>Unlike Magnolia where Tom Cruise's battle-scarred misogyny 'Respect the cock' took the acting honours for pure brio, it's harder to choose a performance from Cradle Will Rock. The impressive ensemble cast - Susan Sarandon, John Tuturro, Bill Murray, Vanessa Redgrave, John Cusack, Joan Cusack, Emily Watson and Hank Azaria - perform as well as you expect; MacFadyen is good, not outstanding. </p> <p>His low profile meant he wasn't an automatic choice to play the celebrated maverick. He pursued the part for six months, as Robbins even toyed with playing Welles himself. Finally, his agent rang to say, 'Well, they've seen everybody else in town and they haven't found Welles, so here's your shot.' He didn't miss. After securing the role, MacFadyen spent a month immersed in all things Wellesian: his films, biographies and radio work. </p> <p>Playing such a figure is bound to provoke dissenting voices. 'I just don't think about that,' he argues. 'You're never going to please everyone. You just have to do your best and walk away from it. And at the end of the day, it's just a movie.' </p> <p>Of course, he's been here before. He played Richard Burton in the US television movie Destiny: The Elizabeth Story and Peter Lawford in HBO's The Rat Pack. The Scottish-born actor facilitated his move to Hollywood with the success of Braveheart, although without the requisite square-jawed handsomeness he cuts an incongruous figure in Los Angeles. </p> <p>But the actor has always fought lazy typecasting. After graduating from the Central School of Speech and Drama he quickly decided heritage drama wasn't his m\u00e9tier. Following a couple of 'Agatha Christie-type whodunits' he opted out. He initially turned down the chance to play the weak-willed Prince Edward in Braveheart . The actor met the cast ing agent but refused to read or even talk about the role, instead making his case for Robert the Bruce. He got his chance when the first-choice actor pulled out at the last minute. </p> <p>His bullish attitude has also earned him the chance to rewrite his own scenes, a privilege on some of the obscure indie films he has made between biopics. This year his recognition factor should rise. Aside from Cradle Will Rock , he stars in Titus , Julie Taymor's visceral adaptation of Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus, co-starring Anthony Hopkins and Jessica Lange. He is Lucius, son of Hopkins's vengeful character. He apparently took the role so he could watch the Welsh actor work at close range. Perhaps he hopes to play him one day. </p> <p><strong>Five things you should know about Angus MacFadyen</strong></p> <p><strong> 1:</strong> He has written a play called 1905, a sequel to Chekhov's Uncle Vanya set in the First Russian Revolution. </p> <p><strong> 2:</strong> His favourite actor is Gerard Depardieu. </p> <p><strong> 3:</strong> When the shooting schedule for Titus stretched from three to five months, he relaxed and spent time 'soaking up the sights and sounds of Rome'. </p> <p><strong> 4:</strong> He stuffed himself on steaks, red wine and chocolate to pile on the pounds for Cradle Will Rock. </p> <p><strong> 5:</strong> He is the son of a doctor in the World Health Organisation. </p> <p>\u0095 Cradle Will Rock opens on 21 April</p>",

His bullish attitude has also earned him the chance to rewrite his own scenes, a privilege on some of the obscure indie films he has made between biopics. This year his recognition factor should rise. Aside from Cradle Will Rock , he stars in Titus , Julie Taymor's visceral adaptation of Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus, co-starring Anthony Hopkins and Jessica Lange. He is Lucius, son of Hopkins's vengeful character. He apparently took the role so he could watch the Welsh actor work at close range. Perhaps he hopes to play him one day. Five things you should know about Angus MacFadyen 1: He has written a play called 1905, a sequel to Chekhov's Uncle Vanya set in the First Russian Revolution. 2: His favourite actor is Gerard Depardieu. 3: When the shooting schedule for Titus stretched from three to five months, he relaxed and spent time 'soaking up the sights and sounds of Rome'. 4: He stuffed himself on steaks, red wine and chocolate to pile on the pounds for Cradle Will Rock. 5: He is the son of a doctor in the World Health Organisation. \u0095 Cradle Will Rock opens on 21 April",

An employee can be accompanied to disciplinary hearings by his or her chosen union rep, even where that union isn't recognised. And for businesses with 1,000 employees in one country in Europe, including the UK, and 150 of them in a second EU country, there will be a hybrid beast called a Works Council which management will have to consult. </p> <p> The enormous number of mergers, and the transfer of workers from the public to the private sector, has created fertile ground for unions, says Sarah Veale, senior policy officer at the TUC. And this is not caused just by insecurity among employees. Multinationals and companies which are going to be affected by the Works Council rules 'can be persuaded it will cost them nothing, in fact they will save money by having centralised bargaining'. </p> <p> What do people want unions to do for them? The answer is quite interesting, according to a survey of 3,065 members of the Communication Workers Union (53 per cent responded). Job security was rated as a'crucial' concern by 77 per cent. This was by far the largest response: even preserving pay and pension conditions only rated 62 per cent. Increasing pay (which many people believe is the reason for having a trade union) was picked by little over half, and better pensions by exactly 50 per cent. </p> <p>Another interesting figure came out of the survey: 42 per cent put 'union influence' as the next most important thing \u00d0 higher than health and safety (37 per cent) or shorter hours (27 per cent). Unison's television adverts about the power of the little ants when they stand together against the big bears has struck a deep chord. </p> <p> There were 75 recognition deals in the first 10 months of 1999, according to the TUC. Two of the possible reasons are that employers recognise the logistical benefit of collective bargaining, and the benefits of a 'partnering' approach; and that with the coming of the Employment Relations Act they see the need to work with the unions. </p> <p>It is not surprising then that Tony Burke, deputy general secretary of the GPMU (Graphical, Print and Media Union) feels he is on a roll. He quotes another figure from the TUC survey - that 5 million people would like to belong to a union - and says that in 12 months his union has got 27 recognition deals. He is also venturing into areas traditionally hard to recruit in, white collar staff in small units. </p> <p>'We have a special section for e-workers - CMS On-line,' he says, meaning clerical, managerial and sales. 'They can go online and get quick advice on contracts, job security and dignity at work- there is a lot of bullying and harassment in e-commerce.' The GPMU has trained 35 organisers in the past year, and recruited four more from Australia: 'They are very experienced at campaigning, at being inclusive,' says Burke. 'We are trying to put back the smile on the face of trade unionism. It has been a dreadful 20 years, but I say we're trying to win in a new way, not lose in the old way.'

In its 1999 Industrial Relations Survey, Dibb Lupton discussed the idea of 'partnering' between unions and management and mentioned that there is 'some nervousness at the altar'. </p> <p> Bradley says 'It is about communicating, and that is something a lot of enterprises have only done in times of crisis.

Suggest you are all given voice mail facilities if you feel you are burdened by taking messages for other people. Understand that open-plan offices function well for people who need to be communicating with each other all the time - dealing rooms, for instance, where people are constantly getting information from colleagues.

You wouldn't guess from his relaxed demeanour that Jones, now 39, has been in the thick of the most significant changes the Beeb has seen in years. Last week, to wide approval, director-general Greg Dyke announced sweeping reforms, aiming to cut out swathes of top-heavy management, re-create 'one BBC' and put programme creativity back on top. </p> <p>However, as a sociologist and specialist in organisational behaviour, Jones will be aware of the signs his style broadcasts to an acutely political organisation. 'I feel completely awful for the people who will have to go,' he says.

But, hesitating over another 'very attractive' offer (from Virgin), he only agreed to move to Langham Place when he was sure that Dyke - 'one of the best chief executives I've ever met' - was joining too. </p> <p>It is easy to see how Jones would complement his direct, hands-on boss. A rare combination of academic and businessman, he has made his name with sociologically-based work on culture and change. Nothing could be more important to today's BBC. In a 1996 article he wrote for Harvard Business Review , Jones described the BBC as a culture which like many others was fragmenting into uncollaborative individualism under the pressure of reforms which pushed efficiency and productivity rather than programme excellence. 'The BBC faces no alternative but to reinvent itself,' he concluded. </p> <p>The beef of many BBC insiders is that the Birtist reforms created just the opposite of efficiency. Because no one was ever removed, just pushed sideways, the upper ranks of Langham Place were silted up with underemployed managers who could only justify their existence by reorganising (usually not to their advantage) the working lives of programme makers and journalists under them. </p> <p>'It was impossible to fathom, let alone influence, the decision-making process,' sighs one ex-BBC journalist. Meanwhile, the deranged internal market meant it was easier and cheaper to buy a music CD for programme purposes than to borrow one from the BBC's own archive. </p> <p>Dyke's description of the corporation as 'overmanaged and underled' has struck a chord with many BBC staffers. Yet for all the popularity of the cause, and the latent commitment of the staff to their uniquely prized and infuriating institution, Jones knows that reinventing the corporation will not be easy. The stakes are sky-high. As with the NHS, every taxpayer has a stake in the BBC and an opinion on how it should be run. Arguably, it is the UK's one true global brand. But at the same time, as a public-service broadcaster in a digital world, it is well into uncharted territory. 'We're living an experiment,' Jones says. </p> <p>The BBC has followed a trajectory from monopoly to oligopoly to a market in which many people already have a choice of 200 channels. In this situation, he believes, a deep and informed debate is required to establish a new common purpose around which BBC staff can cohere. 'Exploring Britishness?' he suggests. </p> <p>Jones knows the BBC is inherently resistant to change. 'It doesn't have shareholders or the City chasing it, so there's always a tendency for it to revert to its original shape - it's the most elastic organisation in the world. We are not going to have a \"change programme\", which would just generate passive resistance. But we do have to pull a cognitive switch which says that change is good - even if in a dynamic environment we'll never get it exactly right.' </p> <p>What the BBC now needs, he believes, is a delicate shift towards a more sociable, supportive way of working, encouraging risk-taking and creativity while at the same time being committed to the collective purpose. </p> <p>Only if people are convinced the BBC is the most attractive place to be in UK - even world - media will it be able to compete in the war for talent with the dot.coms and other new media start-ups which are playing havoc with the management ranks of established firms. 'This is a huge issue for us,' admits Jones. 'If we get less than the best for five years we're gone.' </p> <p>This is one measure against which he - and the BBC - will judge success in the next few years. Another is staff morale.

Here you will find Lundum's, a smart and airy Danish restaurant serving food of such insistent quality it recently came to the notice of the compilers of the Michelin guide, who included the place in their latest edition. Lundum's has a further distinction: it is part-owned by the former Middlesbrough striker Mikkel Beck. </p> <p>\"We opened about a year and a half ago,\" says Beck, who can be found in the restaurant most afternoons fuelling up after training with Queens Park Rangers, where he is currently on loan from Derby. \"And already we are in the Michelin guide. We are very proud of that. It is the premier league of restaurants.\" </p> <p>Following the lead of Victor Kiam, who bought the Remington company because he liked its razors so much, Beck invested in his venture because he liked the chef's food. </p> <p>\"I enjoy eating out, I've done it a lot, more or less once a day since I left Denmark seven years ago,\" he says. \"But I always envied Italian players because wherever they play in the world there will be an Italian restaurant serving the food they are used to. For a Dane this is not so easy. I firmly believe that if you eat well you feel good about yourself and you play well. Then one day, when I was at Middlesbrough, I came down to London to see a friend who took me to this restaurant in the old Danish Club. Danish food: excellent. After the meal we got talking with the family who ran it and they asked if I'd be interested in opening a place with them, because they were only renting and they wanted somewhere of their own. And that is how it came about.\" </p> <p>Does this suggest that the modern footballer, known to be loaded, can't even enjoy a meal without being bombarded by requests for financial backing? </p> <p>\"Not really,\" says Beck. \"This was something out of the blue. But I am very patriotic and I was keen to help any Danish enterprise to get a foothold abroad.\" </p> <p>Beck is coy about how much he put in, but his restaurant does not look like a cheap operation. Elegantly fitted out, in a prime location, on the lunchtime I visited it was full of the well-heeled enjoying an extensive menu of Danish fare. Which begs the question: what exactly constitutes Danish cuisine, beyond the bacon we have all seen Peter Schmeichel advertising on television? </p> <p>\"Fish,\" says Beck. \"But not battered like the English way. You ruin your fish, don't you, with all that batter. At Middlesbrough we used to go to Whitby, where Dracula had his summer house, lovely place, to this restaurant known for serving the best fish and chips, very, very posh. But I never ate it. I had something against fish and chips. When we make fun of English food in Denmark we always laugh about fish and chips.\" </p> <p>Fish maybe, but the co-owner himself always lunches on the same dish: an open sandwich of meatballs on rye bread with a cucumber and beetroot salad. It is, he says, the perfect fuel for the athlete, a tasty combination of protein, fibre and carbohydrate. Though it is not something he himself ever rustles up. </p> <p>\"I don't know how to cook,\" he says. \"But I'm a very good judge. I tell them, cook something for me and I'll tell you whether you're any good or not. That's my role at the restaurant: I said from the beginning I cannot cook, I haven't got a clue about running the business, but what I can do is eat. I think I'm doing quite well there. Actually I feel uneasy in the kitchen, I know this is not my world.\" </p> <p>Which is odd, as many have compared the way a kitchen operates to a football team: it is, after all, about working together for a common goal. </p> <p>\"Yeah, but I saw the programme on the telly about this guy Gordon Ramsay,\" says Beck of the former Rangers player turned celebrity chef. \"I thought that was too much, the way he shouted. If you compare it to a football team, I suppose it's important to have a hierarchy. But I don't think you need to shout like he does. It's the same with some football managers, they think it's about shouting loudly. I don't believe in that. I don't think any human being can perform well in those conditions.\" </p> <p>The Beck softly, softly approach seems to be working. The restaurant has certainly found favour among his fellow professionals. </p> <p>\"Bjarne Goldbaek and Allan Neilsen, the other Danish footballers in London, come here,\" he says. \"And I brought the Derby team here after the last game of last season. It was against Chelsea so I brought everyone, the players, the staff. They loved it.\" </p> <p>Even Jim Smith? He always strikes the seasoned observer as an inveterate pie-and-chips man, not a big fan of fancy foreign food. </p> <p>\"No, no. Jim loved it,\" Beck says, polishing off the last of his smorgasbord. \"I think.\" </p> <p>And the fact that soon after the visit he was farmed out on loan by Smith was entirely coincidental.</p>",

But I am very patriotic and I was keen to help any Danish enterprise to get a foothold abroad.\" Beck is coy about how much he put in, but his restaurant does not look like a cheap operation. Elegantly fitted out, in a prime location, on the lunchtime I visited it was full of the well-heeled enjoying an extensive menu of Danish fare. Which begs the question: what exactly constitutes Danish cuisine, beyond the bacon we have all seen Peter Schmeichel advertising on television? \"Fish,\" says Beck. \"But not battered like the English way. You ruin your fish, don't you, with all that batter. At Middlesbrough we used to go to Whitby, where Dracula had his summer house, lovely place, to this restaurant known for serving the best fish and chips, very, very posh. But I never ate it. I had something against fish and chips. When we make fun of English food in Denmark we always laugh about fish and chips.\" Fish maybe, but the co-owner himself always lunches on the same dish: an open sandwich of meatballs on rye bread with a cucumber and beetroot salad. It is, he says, the perfect fuel for the athlete, a tasty combination of protein, fibre and carbohydrate. Though it is not something he himself ever rustles up. \"I don't know how to cook,\" he says. \"But I'm a very good judge. I tell them, cook something for me and I'll tell you whether you're any good or not. That's my role at the restaurant: I said from the beginning I cannot cook, I haven't got a clue about running the business, but what I can do is eat. I think I'm doing quite well there. Actually I feel uneasy in the kitchen, I know this is not my world.\" Which is odd, as many have compared the way a kitchen operates to a football team: it is, after all, about working together for a common goal. \"Yeah, but I saw the programme on the telly about this guy Gordon Ramsay,\" says Beck of the former Rangers player turned celebrity chef. \"I thought that was too much, the way he shouted. If you compare it to a football team, I suppose it's important to have a hierarchy. But I don't think you need to shout like he does. It's the same with some football managers, they think it's about shouting loudly. I don't believe in that. I don't think any human being can perform well in those conditions.\" The Beck softly, softly approach seems to be working. The restaurant has certainly found favour among his fellow professionals. \"Bjarne Goldbaek and Allan Neilsen, the other Danish footballers in London, come here,\" he says. \"And I brought the Derby team here after the last game of last season. It was against Chelsea so I brought everyone, the players, the staff. They loved it.\" Even Jim Smith? He always strikes the seasoned observer as an inveterate pie-and-chips man, not a big fan of fancy foreign food. \"No, no. Jim loved it,\" Beck says, polishing off the last of his smorgasbord. \"I think.\" And the fact that soon after the visit he was farmed out on loan by Smith was entirely coincidental.",

Don't overdo the warm-up, someone said, this isn't the sort of place you want to do a long stretch. </p> <p>It was clear for most of us that the game represented not much more than an intriguing dinner party conversation topic. And, equally, it became clear immediately we met the opposition that for them it represented something else entirely. They had been waiting for weeks for this, longing for these 90 minutes in the open, 90 minutes of escape from drudging routine, 90 minutes competing on the same terms as representatives of the rest of society.

But there was no swearing, no abusing the referee and when bull-dozing through a tackle, just a polite inquiry of a winded, wheezing rival if he was all right. </p> <p>For prisoners, football is too big a privilege to blow by behaving badly.

According to Terry Goode, the prison's PE officer and a former player with Birmingham City, this is largely because, for security reasons, the latest they can kick-off is nine on a Saturday morning, a time when the rest of the world is locked in the self- inflicted prison of a hangover. But if anyone fancies a fixture against a team oozing skill and reckons they can rouse themselves in time, they should contact Goode at the prison. He would be extremely pleased to hear from you. He knows what a game of football can do. </p> <p>Incidentally, as we left, it became clear that we all remained none the wiser about what specific crimes our opponents had committed. Somehow it would have offended etiquette to ask the bloke you were marking at a corner what exactly he was in for.</p>",

But if anyone fancies a fixture against a team oozing skill and reckons they can rouse themselves in time, they should contact Goode at the prison. He would be extremely pleased to hear from you. He knows what a game of football can do. Incidentally, as we left, it became clear that we all remained none the wiser about what specific crimes our opponents had committed. Somehow it would have offended etiquette to ask the bloke you were marking at a corner what exactly he was in for.",

This is partly to offer a personal holiday service to professional people too busy to pop into their local Thomas Cook office and partly to facilitate exchange visits for players at his soccer schools on Tyneside and in the United States. </p> <p>Barton, who already has a Uefa coaching badge, has been running the schools for three years and this summer he plans to coach in Washington DC, San Diego, Cincinnati, Montreal and Dallas.

      "body": "<p>Not the best introduction to Portugal, the underground carpark at Lisbon airport, but Hades turned into Kafka when the rep proffered three separate maps and diagrams for getting to the hotel on the Estoril coast. Nothing could be simpler, she insisted: just watch out for unmissable landmarks. These turned out to be cloned petrol stations and anonymous shopping centres. But at least they were visible, which is more than signs for Estoril were. Add the late afternoon rush hour: a labyrinth of flyovers, underpasses and junctions, idiosyncratic Portuguese driving, and the panic meter soon rises. </p> <p>In a despairing moment, when it seemed easier to get to El Dorado than Estoril, the equally magic name of Sintra flashed by on an overhead gantry. It seemed better to head there instead, and come back to the Estoril coast, and the Tagus estuary leading up to Lisbon, later in the trip. The car agreed and drove itself as though summoned to a lost domain. </p> <p>The Serra de Sintra (in which the small town of Sintra lies) is so unlike the surrounding countryside, it must have been formed by the gods taking a dollop out of a weird green planet and dumping it a few miles inland of the little right-angled corner formed by the Atlantic and Estoril coasts. This green lumpy goo settled, solidified and fissured to form verdant valleys, sprouted flora, extruded rocks and peaks. On top of these, conquerors, kings, aristos and eccentrics have glued all manner of architectural follies which, far from spoiling Sintra, enhance its natural drama. </p> <p>Fanciful? Only a little. The Moors who occupied this part of the Iberian peninsula from the 8th to the 13th centuries felt Sintra was special. The shell of their crenellated fortress still hogs a hilltop overlooking the town. Portuguese royals built palaces here. Byron was bewitched, and referred to Sintra as a \"glorious Eden\" in Childe Harold's Pilgrimage. </p> <p>It's a bit like, and no bigger than, a spa town in the Peak District, or a hill station in Darjeeling. It's healthy, steep, woody and walkable. There are perhaps too many shops selling souvenirs, not quite enough patisseries (to cater for the fabled Portuguese sweet tooth); there are comfortable hotels (from the old-fashioned Central to the newly-opened Lawrence, in a renovated historic building). But these are sideshows and looking at buildings, gardens and landscapes is what Sintra is all about. </p> <p>Not a lot of distractions at night - except the soundtrack of tourist voices in the outdoor caf\u00e9s, and keys being turned in big old locks by locals. So an early start next day is easy. </p> <p>Right in the town square is the National Palace. Pevsner would be hard put to make sense of its style, but Disney would whoop with joy. The core dates from the 14th century; an earthquake in the 1750s meant substantial reconstruction, and the result is a joyful hodgepodge. Two white-walled Kentish oast houses turn out to be kitchens with mammoth chimneys. </p> <p>Really, it's best not to get too fussed about dates, dynasties and decoration. A bracing zigzag walk up a hillside will, within an hour, take you to the shell of the Moorish castle; further along is the Pena Palace - a Hollywood creation conjured up in the 19th century. </p> <p>The circuit through the Serra, on to the Cabo da Roca (a must see: it's Europe's most westerly point), back along the Estoril coast and the Tagus into Lisbon could be completed easily in half a day. But don't rush. In the car, heading towards the village of Colares, the road is drenched in every shade of green. Off it, indicated by the discreetest of signs, are the quintas : the country houses, some with land attached, some just bucolic retreats with formal gardens. </p> <p>Unlike most stately houses in Britain, the quintas naturally dovetail into their rustic surroundings, rather than dominate them.

      "bodyText": "Not the best introduction to Portugal, the underground carpark at Lisbon airport, but Hades turned into Kafka when the rep proffered three separate maps and diagrams for getting to the hotel on the Estoril coast. Nothing could be simpler, she insisted: just watch out for unmissable landmarks. These turned out to be cloned petrol stations and anonymous shopping centres. But at least they were visible, which is more than signs for Estoril were. Add the late afternoon rush hour: a labyrinth of flyovers, underpasses and junctions, idiosyncratic Portuguese driving, and the panic meter soon rises. In a despairing moment, when it seemed easier to get to El Dorado than Estoril, the equally magic name of Sintra flashed by on an overhead gantry. It seemed better to head there instead, and come back to the Estoril coast, and the Tagus estuary leading up to Lisbon, later in the trip. The car agreed and drove itself as though summoned to a lost domain. The Serra de Sintra (in which the small town of Sintra lies) is so unlike the surrounding countryside, it must have been formed by the gods taking a dollop out of a weird green planet and dumping it a few miles inland of the little right-angled corner formed by the Atlantic and Estoril coasts. This green lumpy goo settled, solidified and fissured to form verdant valleys, sprouted flora, extruded rocks and peaks. On top of these, conquerors, kings, aristos and eccentrics have glued all manner of architectural follies which, far from spoiling Sintra, enhance its natural drama. Fanciful? Only a little. The Moors who occupied this part of the Iberian peninsula from the 8th to the 13th centuries felt Sintra was special. The shell of their crenellated fortress still hogs a hilltop overlooking the town. Portuguese royals built palaces here. Byron was bewitched, and referred to Sintra as a \"glorious Eden\" in Childe Harold's Pilgrimage. It's a bit like, and no bigger than, a spa town in the Peak District, or a hill station in Darjeeling. It's healthy, steep, woody and walkable. There are perhaps too many shops selling souvenirs, not quite enough patisseries (to cater for the fabled Portuguese sweet tooth); there are comfortable hotels (from the old-fashioned Central to the newly-opened Lawrence, in a renovated historic building). But these are sideshows and looking at buildings, gardens and landscapes is what Sintra is all about. Not a lot of distractions at night - except the soundtrack of tourist voices in the outdoor caf\u00e9s, and keys being turned in big old locks by locals. So an early start next day is easy. Right in the town square is the National Palace. Pevsner would be hard put to make sense of its style, but Disney would whoop with joy. The core dates from the 14th century; an earthquake in the 1750s meant substantial reconstruction, and the result is a joyful hodgepodge. Two white-walled Kentish oast houses turn out to be kitchens with mammoth chimneys. Really, it's best not to get too fussed about dates, dynasties and decoration. A bracing zigzag walk up a hillside will, within an hour, take you to the shell of the Moorish castle; further along is the Pena Palace - a Hollywood creation conjured up in the 19th century. The circuit through the Serra, on to the Cabo da Roca (a must see: it's Europe's most westerly point), back along the Estoril coast and the Tagus into Lisbon could be completed easily in half a day. But don't rush. In the car, heading towards the village of Colares, the road is drenched in every shade of green. Off it, indicated by the discreetest of signs, are the quintas : the country houses, some with land attached, some just bucolic retreats with formal gardens. Unlike most stately houses in Britain, the quintas naturally dovetail into their rustic surroundings, rather than dominate them. Sadly, most aren't open to the public. A few owners do B&amp;B and a small number are now hotels. During Sintra's summer music festival, some stage concerts. There are two properties you can visit, however.

      "body": "<p>Fed up with hearing traveller's plans of eggs-otic Easter trips? Nowadays, conversations about the weather in Antigua, the spas in Cyprus and snow conditions in Les Arcs seem to arise far more readily than Christ ever did. But take heart. For those of us who will be celebrating the weekend under somewhat fresher British skies, there are all manner of weekend events planned around the country. </p> <p>Most importantly, at least for young families, are the various Easter egg hunts being arranged in parks and gardens, from \"Easter Egg Hunt 2000\" in botanical <strong> Trebah Garden</strong> near Falmouth in Cornwall (01326-250448) to the National Trust Easter Egg Hunts within the walled garden of Wordsworth's House in <strong> Cockermouth </strong>, Cumbria (01900-824805). Bo'ness and Kinneil Steam Railway (01506-822298), in <strong> Lothian</strong>, is running Easter Egg Specials from the 21st to the 24th, and there's an Easter Treasure Trail on both Sunday and Monday around <strong> Edinburgh Zoo</strong> (0131 334 9171). Alternatively, if you've ever wondered how many hummingbird eggs fit into an ostrich egg (surely...), you can find out by taking part in the great egg trail at Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust in <strong> Washington</strong>, Tyne and Wear (0191 416 5454). </p> <p>The Marlish Farm Visitor Centre in <strong> Northumberland</strong> (01670-772223) invites visitors daily to watch a lamb being born or to help with feeding and holding lambs, chicks and ducklings. Further south, the gentle giants will be out on show at London's Harness Horse Parade in <strong> Battersea Park</strong> on Easter Monday. Trade stands and a children's circus begin at 10.30am, the parade at midday. </p> <p>The unattached can hop away from all the bunny action with Solo's (020-8951 2800) short breaks. A three-night ramble in the Highlands of Scotland on April 21, for example, costs \u00a3265pp for a single room half-board at <strong> Barony Castle</strong>. Naturetrek (01962-733051) goes one better for Easter, offering walkers on its four-day exploration of <strong> Perthshire</strong> hills and lochs the opportunity to add on a day at the town of Fortingall on Loch Tay, widely believed to be the birthplace of Pontius Pilate. The tour costs \u00a3299 (plus \u00a339 for Fortingall), including accommodation, all meals and the services of a naturalist guide. </p> <p>Spotting wildlife - and perhaps a ghost - is all part of a family cycling holiday in the <strong> Cotswolds</strong>. A gentle two-night break from Compass Holidays (01242 250642) can take in the Cotswold Wildlife Park and the haunted riverside ruins of a medieval hall. Prices of \u00a381pp (under 12s go half price) include B&amp;B in Burford, itineraries and tour packs. Bring your own bikes or hire them from Compass (\u00a334). </p> <p>The soccer-mad (both little and large) will get a real kick out of the new Football Academy holiday at Manor Adventure centre in <strong> Shropshire</strong> (01584 861333). An Easter week (beginning April 22) puts six to 17-year-olds through their paces in basic and advanced skills with FA coaches. Parents can follow their own programme from a choice of activities including canoeing, climbing, golfing and walking. Accommodation, activities, outings and meals cost \u00a3279 per child, from \u00a3319 per adult. </p> <p>If your winter has been a long haul, brighten it up with a visit to the Springfields Show Gardens in <strong> Spalding</strong>, Lincs (fax: 01775 711209). At this time of year, they're dancing with daffodils, tulips and hyacinths, the carp lake, palm house and woodland walk bathed in spring sunshine. </p> <p>Various hotels are offering cracking Easter breaks. <strong> Sir Christopher Wren's House</strong> (01753 861354), for example, the original family home of the 17th-century architect tucked beneath the ramparts of Windsor Castle, is offering double rooms between Good Friday and Easter Monday for \u00a355pp B&amp;B, including a chauffeur-driven tour of both Windsor and Eton across the river Thames. </p> <p>The <strong> Grand Hotel</strong> in Eastbourne (01323 412345) is offering a five-star family break, two nights from April 21-23, for \u00a3195pp half-board with up to two children (under 12) sleeping free if sharing their parents' room. The package includes tempo rary membership of the Health and Leisure Club (with pool), live bands, courtesy car transfers into town, a quiz and a tea dance. Children will be kept busy with an Easter Bonnet Parade, egg painting, an egg hunt and daily high tea. </p> <p>A little bodily pampering may also go down a treat. <strong> Ashdown Park</strong> hotel (01342 824988) near Forest Row, in East Sussex, has a health and beauty salon as well as a country club with 18-hole golf course, fully-equipped gym, indoor swimming pool and jogging trails. Its Easter offer means that those booking two nights half- board (\u00a3195pp based on two sharing) will pay only \u00a325 each for the third night's accommodation. <strong> Hartwell House</strong> in Aylesbury (01296-747444) and Bodysgallen in North Wales (01492-584466) are also offering special breaks with spas. </p> <p>If you prefer your chocolate overdosing to be private, various cottages are still up for grabs over the holiday weekend. Lowena, for example, is a large three-bedroomed granite house on the <strong> Lizard Peninsula</strong>, ideally positioned for breezy walks along the rugged Cornish coastline. One week over Easter costs \u00a3433 with Classic Cottages (01326 555555). Premier Cottages Direct (01271 336050) offers stone cottages just yards from the beach at Broad Haven on the <strong> Pembrokeshire</strong> coast. Other agencies include Helpful Holidays (01647 433593), Toad Hall Cottages (01548 853089), and Country Holidays (08700 778800), which has also come up with a selection of properties that welcome pets. </p> <p>Easter's late arrival may mean it's warm enough for a <strong> narrowboat cruise</strong>. Drifters' Latelink service (01905 610550) can help you find a quick break at short notice, in conjunction with British Waterways. Expect to pay around \u00a3425 for a four-berth boat for three nights. </p> <p>On a more cultural note, the World Irish Dancing Championships, held for the first time in its 31-year history outside the Republic, will bring some 10,000 visitors to <strong> Belfast's Waterfront Hall </strong> between Good Friday and the following Thursday. Besides the dances (tickets on 028-9033 4400), the event is an excuse for various excursions and day trips being organised for sightseers: Giant's Causeway and the Antrim coast, the Mourne Mountains of County Down, Londonderry, and many more. All day trips will set off from Belfast, organised by Wrightlines (028-4066 2126) and available every day during the week. </p> <p> <strong> Edinburgh's International Science Festival</strong>, held in various venues around the city, will still be running until Easter Day. (details on 0131-530 2001). </p> <p>And if you've not made your bonnet yet you may find inspiration at Hat Works in <strong> Stockport</strong>, where an exhibition of mad hats, wacky hats, edible hats and delicate hat will open on Easter Monday. It's all part of <strong> Greater Manchester's Family Friendly</strong> initiative this spring, which is detailed on <a href=\"http://www.familyfriendly.org\">www.familyfriendly.org</a> or by phoning 0161- 236 5632. </p> <p>And finally... the true meaning of Easter. This will be celebrated at church services throughout the country including <strong> Rochester Cathedral</strong> in Kent. \"2000 and Rising\" will explore each of the traditional Easter themes by art, bible studies, music, dance and workshops, heralded with a barbecue on arrival.</p> <p>\u0095 For full details of eggstravaganzas, eggsplorer's days, eggcitement, even mill-egg-iums in your area, contact your local tourist information centre or visit the national tourist office websites on: </p> <p>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.visitbritain.com\">www.visitbritain.com</a><br> \u0095 <a href=\"http://www.holiday.scotland.net\">www.holiday.scotland.net</a> <br> \u0095 <a href=\"http://www.visitwales.com\">www.visitwales.com</a></p>",

A three-night ramble in the Highlands of Scotland on April 21, for example, costs \u00a3265pp for a single room half-board at Barony Castle. Naturetrek (01962-733051) goes one better for Easter, offering walkers on its four-day exploration of Perthshire hills and lochs the opportunity to add on a day at the town of Fortingall on Loch Tay, widely believed to be the birthplace of Pontius Pilate. The tour costs \u00a3299 (plus \u00a339 for Fortingall), including accommodation, all meals and the services of a naturalist guide. Spotting wildlife - and perhaps a ghost - is all part of a family cycling holiday in the Cotswolds. A gentle two-night break from Compass Holidays (01242 250642) can take in the Cotswold Wildlife Park and the haunted riverside ruins of a medieval hall. Prices of \u00a381pp (under 12s go half price) include B&amp;B in Burford, itineraries and tour packs. Bring your own bikes or hire them from Compass (\u00a334). The soccer-mad (both little and large) will get a real kick out of the new Football Academy holiday at Manor Adventure centre in Shropshire (01584 861333). An Easter week (beginning April 22) puts six to 17-year-olds through their paces in basic and advanced skills with FA coaches. Parents can follow their own programme from a choice of activities including canoeing, climbing, golfing and walking. Accommodation, activities, outings and meals cost \u00a3279 per child, from \u00a3319 per adult. If your winter has been a long haul, brighten it up with a visit to the Springfields Show Gardens in Spalding, Lincs (fax: 01775 711209). At this time of year, they're dancing with daffodils, tulips and hyacinths, the carp lake, palm house and woodland walk bathed in spring sunshine. Various hotels are offering cracking Easter breaks. Sir Christopher Wren's House (01753 861354), for example, the original family home of the 17th-century architect tucked beneath the ramparts of Windsor Castle, is offering double rooms between Good Friday and Easter Monday for \u00a355pp B&amp;B, including a chauffeur-driven tour of both Windsor and Eton across the river Thames. The Grand Hotel in Eastbourne (01323 412345) is offering a five-star family break, two nights from April 21-23, for \u00a3195pp half-board with up to two children (under 12) sleeping free if sharing their parents' room. The package includes tempo rary membership of the Health and Leisure Club (with pool), live bands, courtesy car transfers into town, a quiz and a tea dance. Children will be kept busy with an Easter Bonnet Parade, egg painting, an egg hunt and daily high tea. A little bodily pampering may also go down a treat. Ashdown Park hotel (01342 824988) near Forest Row, in East Sussex, has a health and beauty salon as well as a country club with 18-hole golf course, fully-equipped gym, indoor swimming pool and jogging trails. Its Easter offer means that those booking two nights half- board (\u00a3195pp based on two sharing) will pay only \u00a325 each for the third night's accommodation. Hartwell House in Aylesbury (01296-747444) and Bodysgallen in North Wales (01492-584466) are also offering special breaks with spas. If you prefer your chocolate overdosing to be private, various cottages are still up for grabs over the holiday weekend. Lowena, for example, is a large three-bedroomed granite house on the Lizard Peninsula, ideally positioned for breezy walks along the rugged Cornish coastline. One week over Easter costs \u00a3433 with Classic Cottages (01326 555555). Premier Cottages Direct (01271 336050) offers stone cottages just yards from the beach at Broad Haven on the Pembrokeshire coast. Other agencies include Helpful Holidays (01647 433593), Toad Hall Cottages (01548 853089), and Country Holidays (08700 778800), which has also come up with a selection of properties that welcome pets. Easter's late arrival may mean it's warm enough for a narrowboat cruise. Drifters' Latelink service (01905 610550) can help you find a quick break at short notice, in conjunction with British Waterways. Expect to pay around \u00a3425 for a four-berth boat for three nights. On a more cultural note, the World Irish Dancing Championships, held for the first time in its 31-year history outside the Republic, will bring some 10,000 visitors to Belfast's Waterfront Hall between Good Friday and the following Thursday. Besides the dances (tickets on 028-9033 4400), the event is an excuse for various excursions and day trips being organised for sightseers: Giant's Causeway and the Antrim coast, the Mourne Mountains of County Down, Londonderry, and many more. All day trips will set off from Belfast, organised by Wrightlines (028-4066 2126) and available every day during the week. Edinburgh's International Science Festival, held in various venues around the city, will still be running until Easter Day. (details on 0131-530 2001). And if you've not made your bonnet yet you may find inspiration at Hat Works in Stockport, where an exhibition of mad hats, wacky hats, edible hats and delicate hat will open on Easter Monday. It's all part of Greater Manchester's Family Friendly initiative this spring, which is detailed on www.familyfriendly.org or by phoning 0161- 236 5632. And finally... the true meaning of Easter. This will be celebrated at church services throughout the country including Rochester Cathedral in Kent. \"2000 and Rising\" will explore each of the traditional Easter themes by art, bible studies, music, dance and workshops, heralded with a barbecue on arrival. \u0095 For full details of eggstravaganzas, eggsplorer's days, eggcitement, even mill-egg-iums in your area, contact your local tourist information centre or visit the national tourist office websites on: \u0095 www.visitbritain.com \u0095 www.holiday.scotland.net \u0095 www.visitwales.com",

      "body": "<p>There's a soft \"ching\" as the tow cable releases and then we're free, soaring through the skies at 3,000ft with no engine to keep us aloft, just 70ft of smooth, narrow glider wing built for one thing - catching a lift on thermal air currents rising up from the ground. </p> <p>Unfortunately, there aren't too many thermals around on this blowy, overcast morning at the London Gliding Club, on the Dunstable Downs near Luton. But not to worry. Behind me, with his hand on the joystick and his feet on the rudder pedals, is John Jeffries, a legendary figure in gliding, with 50 years' experience and an uncanny knack for sniffing out whatever lift is available. </p> <p>As the little yellow tow-plane disappears into the distance, we turn gently to the left and head for a thin patch of telltale cumulus cloud, the fluffy white variety formed by columns of rising air. With the only sound the light whoosh of air slipping over the cockpit, it's easy enough to chat, relax, gape at the view, and enjoy the peace undisturbed by the buzz of a propeller or the roar of an engine. A cloud contains about 20 tons of water, Jeffries says, as we reach the cumulus, and it's all held up by air, so there's more than enough energy around to help nudge a two-man glider further upwards. </p> <p>We're flying a K21 Schlikker, a sleek, half-ton, red- and-white craft built, like most gliders, by the Germans. Largely thanks to the Treaty of Versailles after the first world war, Germany now dominates the market: the treaty banned powered flight in the Fatherland but made no mention of the unpowered variety. So gliding boomed. Apparently it enjoyed particular popularity with the Hitler Youth. </p> <p>The K21 has dual controls and, once we've gained more height, Jeffries lets me take over. The joystick is so sensitive that you don't so much move it as simply apply light pressure and then wait. It couldn't be simpler: left to go left, right to go right, back for up and forward for down. And keep your hands away from the big lever on the top. In the very unlikely case that you are forced to abandon ship, that's the ejector button. Give a yank on that and it's parachute time. </p> <p>Engineless flight is an awesome feeling. We go digging into the bowels of the Earth for filthy, black, polluting oil when there's billions of horsepower just hanging around up in the air. </p> <p>But it would be wrong to think gliders are at the mercy of the elements. The planes can hold their own in winds of up to 60 knots and have been known to reach speeds of 200kmph. The world record for staying airborne is 56 hours, which dwarfs anything achieved with fuelled flight, although record attempts have now been banned for safety reasons. Should you nod off with exhaustion at 3,000ft you might never wake up. </p> <p>But most impressive and surprising of all are the stunts. If you thought you had to be in a Red Arrows jet to loop the loop, think again. Gliders can do it, too, although a glider will go through the manoeuvre like a ballet dancer rather than a bullet. To prove the point, Jeffries pushes the stick forward to dive and build up speed, then pulls it back. One minute we're tearing towards the fields below, the next the sky and the ground have swopped places and the centrifugal force is so powerful I can't raise my hands and I can feel my cheeks being pushed in against my teeth. It makes a ride on a rollercoaster seem like a go on a kids' slide, especially when it's followed up by a stall turn - an almost vertical climb, a 180- degree turn about a wingtip, then a breathtaking dive back down. </p> <p>Aerobatic tricks cost altitude so Jeffries heads for some nearby downs while I try to compose myself and my internal organs. The K21 corkscrews upwards inside a column of rising air about 400ft in diameter, then we fly over Whipsnade Zoo. </p> <p>The London Gliding Club has been going since 1929 and, in the early days, it was not unknown for less-experienced gliders to land in the zoo's enclosures. On one occasion, Lawrence Wright pitched down among the bison. </p> <p>Those were dashing days. No fancy winches or tow planes then. Gliders were launched by elastic ropes stretched manually, catapult fashion, by teams of six or more. But as things grew more advanced, records were set and broken. On April 22, 1939, Geoffrey Stephenson set off from Dunstable Downs in a Gull-1 to perform the first glide across the English Channel. As there are no thermals over the sea, Stephenson had to climb to around 5,500ft before setting off on his journey, which was then downhill all the way. </p> <p>He only just made it - no mean achievement when you consider how crude the crafts were then. In those days, without the help of thermals or wind, gliders lost about 300ft in altitude for every mile travelled. In modern gliders, the figure is about 100ft, which allows Jeffries to lead convoys of gliders on marathon round-trips to north Wales or Somerset, reading the lift and gently leapfrogging from thermal to thermal across the country. </p> <p>It's time to land. The air-brakes - little barriers like mini-hurdles set into the wings - spring up and we drift downwards towards the strip. It's all over in seconds: a smooth descent, an almost imperceptible little bump, a short trundle to a standstill, then a slow lean to the right as the glider comes to rest on its wingtip. No snarl of brakes, no squeal of tyres, no whine of engines being thrown into reverse - just flying the way it ought to be. </p> <p><strong>The practicals</strong></p> <p>The London Gliding Club is at Dunstable Downs, Tring Road, Bedfordshire, LU6 2JP; 01582 663 419. A 15- to 20-min trial lesson with a qualified instructor costs \u00a350. Yearly membership costs \u00a3400 (\u00a3320 if you take a trial lesson). Members pay \u00a317 for a plane launch or \u00a35 for a winch launch, plus 42p per minute for use of a glider and equipment. Five day courses begin at \u00a3349. Open day: May 7.

      "bodyText": "There's a soft \"ching\" as the tow cable releases and then we're free, soaring through the skies at 3,000ft with no engine to keep us aloft, just 70ft of smooth, narrow glider wing built for one thing - catching a lift on thermal air currents rising up from the ground. Unfortunately, there aren't too many thermals around on this blowy, overcast morning at the London Gliding Club, on the Dunstable Downs near Luton. But not to worry. Behind me, with his hand on the joystick and his feet on the rudder pedals, is John Jeffries, a legendary figure in gliding, with 50 years' experience and an uncanny knack for sniffing out whatever lift is available. As the little yellow tow-plane disappears into the distance, we turn gently to the left and head for a thin patch of telltale cumulus cloud, the fluffy white variety formed by columns of rising air. With the only sound the light whoosh of air slipping over the cockpit, it's easy enough to chat, relax, gape at the view, and enjoy the peace undisturbed by the buzz of a propeller or the roar of an engine. A cloud contains about 20 tons of water, Jeffries says, as we reach the cumulus, and it's all held up by air, so there's more than enough energy around to help nudge a two-man glider further upwards. We're flying a K21 Schlikker, a sleek, half-ton, red- and-white craft built, like most gliders, by the Germans. Largely thanks to the Treaty of Versailles after the first world war, Germany now dominates the market: the treaty banned powered flight in the Fatherland but made no mention of the unpowered variety. So gliding boomed. Apparently it enjoyed particular popularity with the Hitler Youth. The K21 has dual controls and, once we've gained more height, Jeffries lets me take over. The joystick is so sensitive that you don't so much move it as simply apply light pressure and then wait. It couldn't be simpler: left to go left, right to go right, back for up and forward for down. And keep your hands away from the big lever on the top. In the very unlikely case that you are forced to abandon ship, that's the ejector button. Give a yank on that and it's parachute time. Engineless flight is an awesome feeling. We go digging into the bowels of the Earth for filthy, black, polluting oil when there's billions of horsepower just hanging around up in the air. But it would be wrong to think gliders are at the mercy of the elements. The planes can hold their own in winds of up to 60 knots and have been known to reach speeds of 200kmph. The world record for staying airborne is 56 hours, which dwarfs anything achieved with fuelled flight, although record attempts have now been banned for safety reasons. Should you nod off with exhaustion at 3,000ft you might never wake up. But most impressive and surprising of all are the stunts. If you thought you had to be in a Red Arrows jet to loop the loop, think again. Gliders can do it, too, although a glider will go through the manoeuvre like a ballet dancer rather than a bullet. To prove the point, Jeffries pushes the stick forward to dive and build up speed, then pulls it back. One minute we're tearing towards the fields below, the next the sky and the ground have swopped places and the centrifugal force is so powerful I can't raise my hands and I can feel my cheeks being pushed in against my teeth. It makes a ride on a rollercoaster seem like a go on a kids' slide, especially when it's followed up by a stall turn - an almost vertical climb, a 180- degree turn about a wingtip, then a breathtaking dive back down. Aerobatic tricks cost altitude so Jeffries heads for some nearby downs while I try to compose myself and my internal organs. The K21 corkscrews upwards inside a column of rising air about 400ft in diameter, then we fly over Whipsnade Zoo. The London Gliding Club has been going since 1929 and, in the early days, it was not unknown for less-experienced gliders to land in the zoo's enclosures. On one occasion, Lawrence Wright pitched down among the bison. Those were dashing days. No fancy winches or tow planes then. Gliders were launched by elastic ropes stretched manually, catapult fashion, by teams of six or more. But as things grew more advanced, records were set and broken. On April 22, 1939, Geoffrey Stephenson set off from Dunstable Downs in a Gull-1 to perform the first glide across the English Channel. As there are no thermals over the sea, Stephenson had to climb to around 5,500ft before setting off on his journey, which was then downhill all the way. He only just made it - no mean achievement when you consider how crude the crafts were then. In those days, without the help of thermals or wind, gliders lost about 300ft in altitude for every mile travelled. In modern gliders, the figure is about 100ft, which allows Jeffries to lead convoys of gliders on marathon round-trips to north Wales or Somerset, reading the lift and gently leapfrogging from thermal to thermal across the country. It's time to land. The air-brakes - little barriers like mini-hurdles set into the wings - spring up and we drift downwards towards the strip. It's all over in seconds: a smooth descent, an almost imperceptible little bump, a short trundle to a standstill, then a slow lean to the right as the glider comes to rest on its wingtip. No snarl of brakes, no squeal of tyres, no whine of engines being thrown into reverse - just flying the way it ought to be. The practicals The London Gliding Club is at Dunstable Downs, Tring Road, Bedfordshire, LU6 2JP; 01582 663 419. A 15- to 20-min trial lesson with a qualified instructor costs \u00a350. Yearly membership costs \u00a3400 (\u00a3320 if you take a trial lesson). Members pay \u00a317 for a plane launch or \u00a35 for a winch launch, plus 42p per minute for use of a glider and equipment. Five day courses begin at \u00a3349. Open day: May 7. To find yor nearest gliding school, ring the British Gliding Association on 0116 253 1051 or http://www.gliding.co.uk.",

      "body": "<p>The last person to shout at me to take my hands out of my pockets was a cantankerous English teacher. I was 15 and deeply embarrassed. I thought those days were past, but a guard at Ho Chi Minh's mausoleum in Hanoi had other ideas. </p> <p>As the queue shuffled past the mummified corpse of modern Vietnam's founding father, the guard quacked and pointed at the thumb lodged in the pocket of my jeans. There was that feeling again - embarrassment and boiling rage. Worse, the child in front had both hands wedged deep in the pockets of his school trousers and yet was spared the ignominy. One rule for the patriotic Vietnamese, another for the western infidels. </p> <p>Vietnam is at a remarkable stage in its development, but what the tour brochures don't tell you is that, for westerners, it is one of the most frustrating countries to travel in. Not a holiday so much as a trek through the quirks of communism, a test of patience and keeping cool. </p> <p>The war between the north and south ended a quarter of a century ago on April 30, 1975, when tanks of the communist North Vietnamese Army crashed through the gates of the Presidential Palace in Saigon (now Ho Chi Minh City). A much hyped liberalisation and reunification programme ( doi moi ) has only slightly eased the suspicion of westerners. </p> <p>Hardly surprising in one way as the Americans flattened much of Vietnam during the war and the French before them ruled at times with an iron fist. It will take time for the Vietnamese to forgive all this, so western visitors will continue to take the flak for foreign governments and soldiers who have been here before them. </p> <p>Best leave all logic and pride in a storage locker at Singapore's Changi airport while transferring on to the three-hour flight to Hanoi. And pack extra supplies of diplomacy with your malaria tablets. Prepare to pay twice the local price for everything from a bus ticket to a loaf of bread, and expect everyone from train conductors to silk shop assistants to try a scam. </p> <p>Vietnam is ill-equipped to handle the hoards of tourists that are predicted to descend on the country soon, but it is still worth the time and effort to explore. </p> <p><strong> Hanoi</strong></p> <p> The mausoleum to Ho Chi Minh is ice-cold and silent. The founder of the Vietnamese Communist Party and former president of North Vietnam, now 110 years old, lies in a glass casket dressed in a black suit and wispy goatee. He is flanked by stock-still soldiers. </p> <p>It is a venerable if rather public tomb, but the opposite of what the old man wanted. Ho Chi Minh requested cremation; instead, he is trapped in a temperature- and humidity-controlled box, gawped at all day and once a year carted off to Russia to be re-stuffed. </p> <p>Outside the sterile hush of the mausoleum, Hanoi teems. Driving here is appalling, yet mastery of the horn is consummate. The best way to beat the traffic is to hire a bicycle. The Vietnamese will think you mad for taking such a primitive form of transport - if they had the cash, they wouldn't be seen dead on anything less than a Honda Dream moped. </p> <p>One of the perks of staying at the De Syloia hotel are the free bikes made of bamboo wrapped around a steel frame. When cycling, follow everybody else. If your shoal of riders decides to run a red light, go with them. Breaking the law here is nigh on impossible, so such displays of mass disobedience are exhilarating. </p> <p>The best cycling is in the Old Quarter, a jumble of 36 narrow streets each with a speciality trade. Thirteenth-century Hanoians were judged on their address. That must have been fine for folks in Cotton Street or String Instrument Alley, but I felt for those who had to admit to living in Pickled Fish or Clamworm Streets. </p> <p>Silk Street is a shopper's paradise with embroidered shirts, scarves and velvet jackets hanging by the hundred and at criminally low prices. Street stalls are laden with brightly-coloured lacquerware - trinket boxes, plates and bowls of shimmering gold and cerulean blue. </p> <p>Central to Hanoi, both geographically and spiritually is Ho\u00e0n Ki\u00e9m Lake. At dawn, people come here to do t'ai chi, watching their reflections in the glass-like waters. As I strolled among them one morning, I witnessed the Ho\u00e0n Ki\u00e9m turtle put in an appearance - the first for six years and auspicious as this is Hanoi's anniversary year. </p> <p><strong> Stay at:</strong> De Syloia (from \u00a368 for a double, 00 844 824 5346, <a href=\"mailto:desyloia@hn.vnn.vn\">desyloia@hn.vnn.vn</a>), Metropole (from \u00a3140 double, 00 844 826 6919, <a href=\"mailto:sofmet@netnam.org.vn\">sofmet@netnam.org.vn</a>). <br><strong> Eat at:</strong> Little Hanoi in the Old Quarter (from \u00a32), Hoa Sua (from \u00a34). </p> <p><strong> Hu\u00e9 and Hoi An</strong></p> <p> The ancient capital city of Hu\u00e9 has some restful pagodas and the remains of the mighty Citadel - the former presidential palace. It is a pit-stop for travellers wanting to tour the DMZ - the demilitarised zone created when Vietnam was split in half after the second world war. Given its name, it is ironic that this region saw some of the worst battles of the American war. </p> <p>Hoi An is the quieter and less explored of the two.

Flashes of bright scarlet and violet break a sea of lime-green - the shirts of farmers broadcasting seed or bent double harvesting their crops. </p> <p>The train idles across iron bridges over rivers where boys break off from fishing to wave frantically at the carriages. Closer to Nha Trang, it traces the coastline at walking pace, sometimes right on the cliff edge, affording wonderful views of rocky offshore islands. </p> <p>Nha Trang is a laid-back beach town with neither glitz nor glamour and makes a welcome break from the rumble of the tracks. </p> <p>For a couple of nights of tropical luxury and a stretch of virtually empty beach, check in to the sumptuous Ana Mandara resort.

Vietnam Airlines is shaking off a shocking safety record; internal flights are only slightly more pricey than trains. \u0095 Don't argue with officials - many are looking for excuses to make life unsettling for westerners. \u0095 Respect customs and traditions, especially in Buddhist temples. \u0095 Always be cautious when taking pictures. Never snap anyone or anything official. \u0095 Take US dollars in cash and travellers cheques but not crisp new bills.

Record producer Pete Waterman maintains, meanwhile, that the chart remains a valid yardstick for the quality of the music and the tastes of the record-buying public. Read the debate and <a href=\"http://talk.newsunlimited.co.uk/WebX?13@@.ee74aa8\">have your say here</a>.</p> <p><b>Dear Pete,</b><br> So this is a momentous week in pop history? The mighty Westlife have grabbed their fifth consecutive number one single. Everything they've released has now smashed straight into the \"hit parade\" at the very top. And they've broken almost every record going - an action most music fans can empathise with where Westlife are concerned. They're more prolific than Elvis, more successful than the Spice Girls, bigger than Abba, hot on the heels of the Beatles. All, apparently, facts! The first act to debut at number one with their first five singles... ever.</p> <p>This ought to mean that Westlife - five should-be trainee hairdressers with a penchant for saccharine karaoke ballads - are the most popular band British music has ever seen. A panacea for music in the 21st century, rewriting history as they stride through the annals of pop, with Madonna, Take That, and, of course, B*witched - whose record they broke - floundering in their wake.</p> <p>Or does this simply reinforce how redundant and worthless the charts have become? In the 37 years after NME ran Britain's first ever chart - on November 14, 1952 - only 20 records debuted at number one. In the last 10 years there have been over 120. A number one record has been devalued so much that you'd almost suspect Norman Lamont's involvement.</p> <p>Yours,<br> Ben Knowles<br> Editor, NME</p> <p><b>Dear Ben,</b><br> Forty years ago, I bought the NME religiously to see what the chart was - but I was 12 or 13 then. You're not, and that's the point.</p> <p>What you and I, as professionals, think of today's music is irrelevant. It's the people who buy singles who matter, the people who are excited by Westlife. From a business point of view, give me 20 number ones a year, please, and I'll be happy - in the pop business, anything less than the top five is not a result. The reason I'd have done anything I could to make Steps number one this week is that it's a barometer of the popularity of the band, a guarantee that I've got money coming in to pay my staff, and a signal to the band of how successful they are.</p> <p>The case of the Beatles always gets trotted out - but every Beatles single did not sell a million. Certain singles did, such as She Loves You, because they became landmarks in pop history. But singles are enormous now, the biggest I've seen in the last 20 years: Tragedy sold 1.6m singles, and even in the 1980s those were the kind of figures too. Whether it's 1962, 1972 or 2000, that's a staggering amount of records. And now they cost \u00a33.99: when I sold 600,000 Rick Astleys it was at 98p each.</p> <p>When we grow old, we become cynical; we don't enjoy the excitement of making musical discoveries as we first did. My daughters are 10 and eight; they are excited that Westlife is number one again this week - and they know more about pop music than I do.</p> <p>Yours, <br> Pete Waterman<br> Producer</p> <p><b>Dear Pete,</b><br> Cynical, eh? I couldn't claim to get as excited as a nine-year-old pop kid when hearing the new A1 or Atomic Kittens singles - but I've got as excited as you seem to believe a grown-up is able by discovering new records from the likes of Kelis or Doves this year.</p> <p>It's not who is buying singles, or even what they're buying, that is decimating the standing of the charts - but rather the where, the how, and to an extent the why.

They want to make money on any single; they don't care if it's hip-hop, bebop or doo-wop. The important point for them is that it brings people into their stores. There's no discrimination by Woolworths - that's just a ridiculous statement. And if you added up all the sales of bhangra, hip-hop and other independent music over the last week, would they have sold more than the top three pop singles? I don't think so.

      "bodyText": "As Westlife celebrate their fifth consecutive number one single, NME editor Ben Knowles argues that commercial manipulation has rendered the singles chart redundant and worthless. Record producer Pete Waterman maintains, meanwhile, that the chart remains a valid yardstick for the quality of the music and the tastes of the record-buying public. Read the debate and have your say here. Dear Pete, So this is a momentous week in pop history? The mighty Westlife have grabbed their fifth consecutive number one single. Everything they've released has now smashed straight into the \"hit parade\" at the very top. And they've broken almost every record going - an action most music fans can empathise with where Westlife are concerned. They're more prolific than Elvis, more successful than the Spice Girls, bigger than Abba, hot on the heels of the Beatles. All, apparently, facts! The first act to debut at number one with their first five singles... ever. This ought to mean that Westlife - five should-be trainee hairdressers with a penchant for saccharine karaoke ballads - are the most popular band British music has ever seen. A panacea for music in the 21st century, rewriting history as they stride through the annals of pop, with Madonna, Take That, and, of course, B*witched - whose record they broke - floundering in their wake. Or does this simply reinforce how redundant and worthless the charts have become? In the 37 years after NME ran Britain's first ever chart - on November 14, 1952 - only 20 records debuted at number one. In the last 10 years there have been over 120. A number one record has been devalued so much that you'd almost suspect Norman Lamont's involvement. Yours, Ben Knowles Editor, NME Dear Ben, Forty years ago, I bought the NME religiously to see what the chart was - but I was 12 or 13 then. You're not, and that's the point. What you and I, as professionals, think of today's music is irrelevant. It's the people who buy singles who matter, the people who are excited by Westlife. From a business point of view, give me 20 number ones a year, please, and I'll be happy - in the pop business, anything less than the top five is not a result. The reason I'd have done anything I could to make Steps number one this week is that it's a barometer of the popularity of the band, a guarantee that I've got money coming in to pay my staff, and a signal to the band of how successful they are. The case of the Beatles always gets trotted out - but every Beatles single did not sell a million. Certain singles did, such as She Loves You, because they became landmarks in pop history.

Whether it's 1962, 1972 or 2000, that's a staggering amount of records. And now they cost \u00a33.99: when I sold 600,000 Rick Astleys it was at 98p each. When we grow old, we become cynical; we don't enjoy the excitement of making musical discoveries as we first did. My daughters are 10 and eight; they are excited that Westlife is number one again this week - and they know more about pop music than I do. Yours, Pete Waterman Producer Dear Pete, Cynical, eh?

      "body": "<p>Puglia is not paradise, but it's on the way. Or at least that's how the Crusaders saw it. For them, Italy's south-eastern corner - the heel on the Italian boot - was the stepping-stone to heaven, the quickest route to the Holy Land. And they were not the only ones. Saracens and Normans, Spaniards and Swabians - they all saw Puglia not for what it is, but for where it leads. For as long as anyone can remember, Puglia has been the place you pass through to get somewhere else: it's the Didcot of the Adriatic. </p> <p>We Brits are no better. As any self-respecting ex-InterRailer remembers, Puglia's twin ports - Bari and Brindisi - are the climb-aboard points for the nightboat to Greece. But when it comes to the cities themselves, who noticed? Even the most recent brand of traveller to pack out Puglia's ferry fleets - Albanian \u00e9migr\u00e9s returning to Kosovo, ready to join up with the KLA - were probably too fixated on their destination to see the town that helped get them there. </p> <p>These days the Puglians are getting tired of directing the world's tourist traffic - they want to have some of it for themselves. They've started promoting their region, offering it as the unspoiled corner of Italy the holiday industry forgot. They insist that Puglia has it all: a coastline of sandy beaches, rugged countryside, great food, local wine and a fair clutch of medieval architecture. Better still, they'll tell you, Puglia is where all Italy's best stuff comes from. The guide books fizz with bragging data: the region produces 80% of all the pasta eaten in Europe, most of Italy's fish, more wine than Germany and a larger volume of olive oil than all the other Italian regions combined. The well-dressed women of Bari will whisper proudly that the man behind Costume National, Italy's chicest label, is a Puglian. As befits a heel, Italy rests on Puglia. </p> <p>So an open mind is a requisite travel aid when heading for this most unexplored of Italy's regions, along with a cast-iron promise that you're not just passing through. If your inner child starts asking, \"Are we there yet?\" the compulsory answer is: \"Yes.\" </p> <p>In that spirit, a 48-hour spin around Puglia can be an unexpected pleasure. Even the industrial port of Bari has secret jewels hidden away. The weekend crowd strolling along the waterfront of the Lungamare treat it like their very own Riviera. Windsurfers jostle with amateur fishermen for the best stretch of water, while cyclists breeze past slow, ambling couples and ice-cream-clutching families. Some new, well-appointed hotels are popping up, but the most striking buildings are probably the local police station and military academy - both monuments to the neo-imperial swagger of the Mussolini era. </p> <p>Beyond the Lungamare - whose long, concrete promenade resembles the Malecon that dominates Havana - Bari itself is worth a wander. The wide boulevards, ornate fountains and creaky trams add to the whiff of faded, southern European grandeur. Bari is a tough, sweat-work town but it has a dusty kind of elegance, too - a reminder that nearly two centuries ago the King of Naples had regal ideas for the place, ordering his architects to add the avenues and piazzas that would make Bari a regional force to be reckoned with. </p> <p>Still, the greatest lure is the district where all the King's grids and plans made not a dent. At the end of the Corso Cavour stands the old city, a dense maze of mud-brown backstreets. Three turns and you could be in another country: Greece, perhaps, or somewhere even further east. The narrow passages, courtyards and arches might have been transplanted from Jerusalem or Tangier. The farthest corners feel as if they have been undisturbed for decades - until you see the graffiti lauding the hallowed name of Manchester United. </p> <p>The coastal drive southward can be frustrating - it's hard to hug the shore and avoid the no-view blandness of motorway - but it's a quick enough run to Monopoli and, from there, a turn inland. Before long, the countryside has become photogenic again. It's pretty but unmanicured, clear evidence of a rural economy where the land still has to work for a living. But what stays in the memory is the signature structure of Puglia: the trullo. </p> <p>Built like stone mudhuts, these whitewashed homes fill the skyline like a chain of man-made beehives. The bigger trulli consist of several circular rooms clustered together, each one with its own stone-tiled, cone-shaped roof, topped off with a sphere or, occasionally, an ornamental symbol at the peak. No one's quite sure who put them here - some say it was the Cretans, as long ago as 2000BC, but there is a distinctly Moorish feel to them too, especially when the rooftop ornament is an Islamic-style crescent, forming a skyline of mini-minarets. Nor is anyone absolutely certain why they were built, or why they are only to be found in Puglia. </p> <p>Some say the circular shape makes for a cool haven from the punishing southern Italian heat. Whatever their origins, the trulli are just like their name, dinky and sweet. It's hard not to cheer every time you see one. </p> <p>For the true trulli fanatic, Mecca is Alberobello, home to the largest concentration of the mysterious structures in all of Puglia. There are around 1,500 of them crammed into this tiny village, turning the residents into trulli obsessives. You're never more than a few yards away from a local entrepreneur offering you a trullo-shaped object: a beehive-shaped bottle of syrupy, overpriced liqueur or a cigarette-lighter for the coffee table. </p> <p>Every now and again, the trulli have to take second place to the other local religion. We coincided with Santa Lucia day, which saw the entire village converge on the Piazza Del Popolo to watch a brass-band procession from the church, followed by a home-made firework display. The sight of old men perched on wooden folding chairs, teenagers checking out the talent and seven-year-olds playing street football could have come straight from Cinema Paradiso. It may be a clich\u00e9, but it was a treat to stumble across it. </p> <p>And that's how it tends to be in Puglia. Free of the guilty obligation to see world-famous sights, you can just pootle around the windy country lanes and wait for a pleasant surprise to pounce on you. So, Martina Franca may look like a dot on the map just south of Alberobello, but peek round the tower blocks that mark its approach and you'll find a Moorish network of cobbled streets, whitewashed walls as well as some striking baroque squares. </p> <p>Or you'll head north up the coast from Bari toTrani. The tourist guides tell you about the 11th century Duomo, consisting of three churches built on top of each other like an upside-down wedding cake, but they don't mention Trani's real delight: a piazza of pink and yellow colonial-style buildings, all looking out on a decidedly unpretentious marina. The sailboats, the pink sunset and an evening glass of Puglian wine - you won't want to leave. </p> <p>With competition from Rome, Venice, Tuscany and Umbria, no wonder nobody's had time to notice Puglia. But it's worth a look - even if you're just passing through.</p> <p><strong> Day 1</strong> </p> <p><strong> 9am:</strong> Breakfast on the terrace at Il Melograno, near Monopoli: like Puglia itself, a charming place that's off the beaten path. </p> <p><strong> 11am:</strong> Drive into trulli country, stopping eventually in Martina Franca. There, have lunch at the Caffe Tripoli in Piazza Garibaldi, which is worth finding just for the art-deco sign outside - and for the tapas-style hors d'oeuvres, good coffee and fine sorbets. </p> <p><strong> 5pm</strong> <strong> onwards:</strong> On to Alberobello for the ultimate in trulli spotting, and for an evening in honour of local saint, Santa Lucia. Dinner at Il Poeta Contadino, a kind of illuminated courtyard with Puglian specialities, including the local ear-shaped pasta, orecchiette. </p> <p> <strong> Day 2</strong> </p> <p><strong> 11 am: </strong> Take the coast road to Bari. Stroll the Lungamare, linger over that day's fix of ice cream. </p> <p><strong> 2pm: </strong> Check out the city. Peek at the Cattedrale di San Sabino and the Basilica di San Nicola. Get enjoyably lost in the old city. </p> <p><strong> 4pm:</strong> Head north to Trani. Wander through medieval streets, imagining the port's clearly commercial, cosmopolitan past: Via Cambio, Via Sinagoga. While away the late afternoon people-watching from the palm-fringed terrace of the Orangerie. Lights flicker on the water; mobile phones chirrup. </p> <p><strong> 8pm:</strong> Dinner of fresh, just-caught fish at La Nicchio on Corso Inbriani. The sun sets, and the drive home beckons. </p> <p><strong>The practicals</strong></p> <p>Italian Expressions (020 7435 2525) has five nights, including Alitalia floghts, car hire and hlaf board at Il Melograno, from \u00a31045 per peraon, seven nights from \u00a31317 per person.

Even the industrial port of Bari has secret jewels hidden away. The weekend crowd strolling along the waterfront of the Lungamare treat it like their very own Riviera. Windsurfers jostle with amateur fishermen for the best stretch of water, while cyclists breeze past slow, ambling couples and ice-cream-clutching families. Some new, well-appointed hotels are popping up, but the most striking buildings are probably the local police station and military academy - both monuments to the neo-imperial swagger of the Mussolini era. Beyond the Lungamare - whose long, concrete promenade resembles the Malecon that dominates Havana - Bari itself is worth a wander. The wide boulevards, ornate fountains and creaky trams add to the whiff of faded, southern European grandeur. Bari is a tough, sweat-work town but it has a dusty kind of elegance, too - a reminder that nearly two centuries ago the King of Naples had regal ideas for the place, ordering his architects to add the avenues and piazzas that would make Bari a regional force to be reckoned with. Still, the greatest lure is the district where all the King's grids and plans made not a dent. At the end of the Corso Cavour stands the old city, a dense maze of mud-brown backstreets. Three turns and you could be in another country: Greece, perhaps, or somewhere even further east. The narrow passages, courtyards and arches might have been transplanted from Jerusalem or Tangier. The farthest corners feel as if they have been undisturbed for decades - until you see the graffiti lauding the hallowed name of Manchester United. The coastal drive southward can be frustrating - it's hard to hug the shore and avoid the no-view blandness of motorway - but it's a quick enough run to Monopoli and, from there, a turn inland. Before long, the countryside has become photogenic again. It's pretty but unmanicured, clear evidence of a rural economy where the land still has to work for a living. But what stays in the memory is the signature structure of Puglia: the trullo. Built like stone mudhuts, these whitewashed homes fill the skyline like a chain of man-made beehives. The bigger trulli consist of several circular rooms clustered together, each one with its own stone-tiled, cone-shaped roof, topped off with a sphere or, occasionally, an ornamental symbol at the peak. No one's quite sure who put them here - some say it was the Cretans, as long ago as 2000BC, but there is a distinctly Moorish feel to them too, especially when the rooftop ornament is an Islamic-style crescent, forming a skyline of mini-minarets. Nor is anyone absolutely certain why they were built, or why they are only to be found in Puglia. Some say the circular shape makes for a cool haven from the punishing southern Italian heat. Whatever their origins, the trulli are just like their name, dinky and sweet. It's hard not to cheer every time you see one. For the true trulli fanatic, Mecca is Alberobello, home to the largest concentration of the mysterious structures in all of Puglia. There are around 1,500 of them crammed into this tiny village, turning the residents into trulli obsessives. You're never more than a few yards away from a local entrepreneur offering you a trullo-shaped object: a beehive-shaped bottle of syrupy, overpriced liqueur or a cigarette-lighter for the coffee table. Every now and again, the trulli have to take second place to the other local religion. We coincided with Santa Lucia day, which saw the entire village converge on the Piazza Del Popolo to watch a brass-band procession from the church, followed by a home-made firework display. The sight of old men perched on wooden folding chairs, teenagers checking out the talent and seven-year-olds playing street football could have come straight from Cinema Paradiso. It may be a clich\u00e9, but it was a treat to stumble across it. And that's how it tends to be in Puglia. Free of the guilty obligation to see world-famous sights, you can just pootle around the windy country lanes and wait for a pleasant surprise to pounce on you. So, Martina Franca may look like a dot on the map just south of Alberobello, but peek round the tower blocks that mark its approach and you'll find a Moorish network of cobbled streets, whitewashed walls as well as some striking baroque squares. Or you'll head north up the coast from Bari toTrani. The tourist guides tell you about the 11th century Duomo, consisting of three churches built on top of each other like an upside-down wedding cake, but they don't mention Trani's real delight: a piazza of pink and yellow colonial-style buildings, all looking out on a decidedly unpretentious marina. The sailboats, the pink sunset and an evening glass of Puglian wine - you won't want to leave. With competition from Rome, Venice, Tuscany and Umbria, no wonder nobody's had time to notice Puglia. But it's worth a look - even if you're just passing through. Day 1 9am: Breakfast on the terrace at Il Melograno, near Monopoli: like Puglia itself, a charming place that's off the beaten path. 11am: Drive into trulli country, stopping eventually in Martina Franca. There, have lunch at the Caffe Tripoli in Piazza Garibaldi, which is worth finding just for the art-deco sign outside - and for the tapas-style hors d'oeuvres, good coffee and fine sorbets. 5pm onwards: On to Alberobello for the ultimate in trulli spotting, and for an evening in honour of local saint, Santa Lucia. Dinner at Il Poeta Contadino, a kind of illuminated courtyard with Puglian specialities, including the local ear-shaped pasta, orecchiette. Day 2 11 am: Take the coast road to Bari. Stroll the Lungamare, linger over that day's fix of ice cream. 2pm: Check out the city. Peek at the Cattedrale di San Sabino and the Basilica di San Nicola. Get enjoyably lost in the old city. 4pm: Head north to Trani. Wander through medieval streets, imagining the port's clearly commercial, cosmopolitan past: Via Cambio, Via Sinagoga. While away the late afternoon people-watching from the palm-fringed terrace of the Orangerie. Lights flicker on the water; mobile phones chirrup. 8pm: Dinner of fresh, just-caught fish at La Nicchio on Corso Inbriani. The sun sets, and the drive home beckons. The practicals Italian Expressions (020 7435 2525) has five nights, including Alitalia floghts, car hire and hlaf board at Il Melograno, from \u00a31045 per peraon, seven nights from \u00a31317 per person.

      "body": "<p>When farmer Tim Reed sold off his dairy herd in 1992 to set up a holiday business, people said he was mad. Milk prices were high and farming was all he knew. With the money he raised from the sale, he renovated some disused stone buildings on his 200-acre sheep and arable farm in Cornwall and opened six holiday cottages. Eight years on, the dairy market has gone into freefall and the cottages account for 75% of Tredethick Farm's total income. </p> <p>With hindsight, it was a good decision. Reed has since built three more cottages and added a games room, adventure playground and pets farmyard for children. He enjoys having people around - there can be up to 40 guests a week in August - though he says some forget that he also has a working farm to run. </p> <p>\"I have to remind myself that it can be more profitable to spend half an hour chatting with a guest who will then make a repeat booking than half-hour ploughing the fields,\" says Reed. </p> <p>When the Northern Ireland Tourist Board announced its EU-funded Rural Cottages scheme in 1995, offering landowners 80% subsidies to renovate their derelict barns and outbuildings in return for a 21-year lease for holiday use, they were flooded with more than 700 applications. With the average income on a Northern Irish farm barely \u00a35,000 a year, the chance to make some additional revenue was too good to pass up. </p> <p>Farming incomes have fallen 60% in the past five years. In the same period, rural tourism has become the fastest-growing UK tourism sector, accounting for 12 million holiday trips a year, \u00a311.5bn in tourist spending and supporting more than 350,000 jobs. More rural and farm-based attractions have opened in the past 10 years than any other type of attraction. </p> <p>Much of the growth has been encouraged by government funding.

      "bodyText": "When farmer Tim Reed sold off his dairy herd in 1992 to set up a holiday business, people said he was mad. Milk prices were high and farming was all he knew. With the money he raised from the sale, he renovated some disused stone buildings on his 200-acre sheep and arable farm in Cornwall and opened six holiday cottages. Eight years on, the dairy market has gone into freefall and the cottages account for 75% of Tredethick Farm's total income. With hindsight, it was a good decision. Reed has since built three more cottages and added a games room, adventure playground and pets farmyard for children. He enjoys having people around - there can be up to 40 guests a week in August - though he says some forget that he also has a working farm to run. \"I have to remind myself that it can be more profitable to spend half an hour chatting with a guest who will then make a repeat booking than half-hour ploughing the fields,\" says Reed. When the Northern Ireland Tourist Board announced its EU-funded Rural Cottages scheme in 1995, offering landowners 80% subsidies to renovate their derelict barns and outbuildings in return for a 21-year lease for holiday use, they were flooded with more than 700 applications. With the average income on a Northern Irish farm barely \u00a35,000 a year, the chance to make some additional revenue was too good to pass up. Farming incomes have fallen 60% in the past five years. In the same period, rural tourism has become the fastest-growing UK tourism sector, accounting for 12 million holiday trips a year, \u00a311.5bn in tourist spending and supporting more than 350,000 jobs. More rural and farm-based attractions have opened in the past 10 years than any other type of attraction. Much of the growth has been encouraged by government funding. Rural diversification is one of the cornerstones of the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Fisheries' (MAFF) rescue package for farmers. It has made funds of \u00a3150m available as part of its Rural Enterprise Scheme and tourism projects are high on the agenda. There is no doubt that tourism, managed wisely, can bring valuable extra revenue to the countryside and help ensure the continuation of rural lifelines, such as the village shop, local transport and farmers' markets. But concern is growing that Government handouts are distorting the market and encouraging farmers to swap one high-risk, low-income business for another. The Southwest is one of the pockets of the UK that was designated as an area for financial assistance. There are now more than 4,000 farm-related tourism businesses in Cornwall and Devon alone and, according to Reed, it's reached saturation point. \"What is the point of the Government encouraging farmers to go into an industry where supply is growing faster than demand?

      "body": "<p>I am deep under a hilltop in a train without rails, and my bubbly French guide has a nervous giggle. \"Okay,\" she says. \"I am going to give you some safety advice now.\" And she explains that, while flashguns may be aimed to left or right of the non-existent track, they must never be aimed forward. \"This train is guided by laser light,\" she says, \"and the flashes would make the train change direction. Tee-hee-hee.\" </p> <p>It is the second time in 24 hours that I have been hauled through a long tunnel. Although on the first occasion I had the entire English Channel above my head, at least I could be reasonably sure that my driver knew the route. Yet these cellars, dug under the edge of Epernay in the 1870s to store wine made by the Mercier champagne house, comprise 18km of dank, criss-crossing passages. And already we have taken three turns to the left and four to the right . . . </p> <p>There is one consolation, of course. In the event of our train becoming lost, we poor passengers will have access to some 18 million bottles of Mercier's finest. If that doesn't keep our spirits up, nothing will. Tee-hee-hee. </p> <p>Do you know how they make that stuff? Do you have any idea what's involved in the famous m\u00e9thode champagnoise ? They don't just pump it up with CO2 out of a gas cylinder, you know. It's not Coca-Cola. It's the real thing. Our girl guide is gallantly rattling through the process right now. \"The natural sugar of the must transforms into alcohol and carbon dioxide,\"she says. \"If you have some questions, you can ask me, of course, after the visit. Tee-hee-hee.\" </p> <p>But what she hasn't allowed for is that most of the Brits in this truck know as much about the chemistry of fermentation as Baudelaire knew about Eurotunnel's back-up signalling systems. Fortunately, I've made a little elderberry wine in my time. So move over, Nicole. Papa's going to handle this part of the tour. </p> <p>The main thing you need to know is that when yeast eats sugar, you're left with alcohol (good), carbon dioxide (good) and dead yeast (bad). To make normal wine, just press the juice out of some grapes, seed it with yeast and wait for the concoction to fizz up like sherbert. Eventually, the gas blows away, the fizzing subsides and the solids all sink to the bottom. At this point, simply pour the clear, alcoholic liquid into a bottle, label it Chateau Dunroamin, and cork it. </p> <p>But what if the fizzing starts again once the wine is bottled? Argh! Even if the bottle doesn't explode in your face, you'll be left with cloudy wine on account of all that new sediment. And (horror of horrors), the stuff will be fizzy. </p> <p>And that, for one reason and another, is what used to happen all too frequently in the wine-making district around Epernay. \"Cette abominable boisson,\" is how somebody once described the local product. However did they transform this muck into the classiest drink on the planet? </p> <p>The name on that little headstone is Mo\u00ebt et Chandon, and it marks a broad strip of vines owned by the celebrated champagne house of that name. Next to it is a field of spuds. Honestly, I know my root crops. They are just plain potatoes. We have left the Mercier cellars now - no point spending one's entire holiday in a tunnel. We have sampled the product (the \u00a33 ticket price included a glass of Brut) and we have crumpled in the face of temptation and made some purchases in the shop. </p> <p>We have then tripped rather lightly, given the time of morning, into the unexpected brightness of the Avenue de Champagne (funny to think of all those tunnels beneath our feet), and we have noted (for another day) that every other big name in the business seems to have a mini-chateau in this one grand street, along with a museum, a welcoming cellar and, of course, a shop. And we have now driven a few miles out of Epernay to a land where larks sing and distant church bells ring and pinot noir grows alongside potatoes. </p> <p>Pinot noir? But isn't that a black grape, or at least a red so dark and strong that it gives red Burgundy the feel of blackcurrant jam? What has Pinot Noir got to do with icy sharp, steely-white champagne? </p> <p>The fact is, this whole vinification business is distressingly complicated. Three sorts of grape go into making champagne (and some cham pagne is pink). One of them, Chardonnay, is a white grape. But although the other two, Pinot Noir and its cousin, Pinot Meunier, are black when grown in Burgundy, in these northerly climes, they rarely get very much colour in their cheeks. </p> <p>It was a local monk called Dom Pierre Perignon who, some time around 1690, realised that if you pick the grapes good and early, handle them carefully, then press them ever so gently, you have a \"white juice\" like no other. And this plateau, with its prairie fields of cereal, really is an awfully long way north to be growing grapes. See those low hills? They are the bottom edge of the great chalk rim whose top edge the English know as the South Downs. Here, they are capped with broad-leaf woodland. But below the woodland, on the slopes that rise above the ordinary farmland, is a corduroy fringe resembling nothing so much as an agglomeration of medieval strip fields. These, surprisingly, are the vineyards of Champagne. </p> <p>Surprisingly, because none of it resembles what I imagined a wine-growing district to look like. They grow sugar beet here and fields of wheat as far as the eye can see. And then there are those spuds, rubbing up against the Pinot Noir. Here, it seems, grapes are just another crop - champagne just another vegetable-processing industry. There is no real magic beneath that gold foil capsule. Or is there? </p> <p>The vineyards are row upon row of wires, stretched between steel stakes like some vast radio telescope listening intently to space. Captive beneath the mesh are the vines, dormant now, and bent almost double. These plants have been cut back to the knuckle. Only four shoots remain, and these are attached to the framework by little paper and wire twists - the sort you might use to tie a freezer bag. Wires, stakes, vines, shoots, twists. All is precise and neat, measured, calculated, the result of years and years of experimentation and refining. It has the feel of ritual, of secret knowledge and magic. </p> <p>For how else, other than through magic, did these people turn what was once considered an abominable drink into a byword for celebration? </p> <p> Consider the problem. Louis XIV is dead, a young man is on the throne and all the world is light and gay. Your gimmicky fizz, now dispensed from new-fangled tough glass bottles with corks tied down by string, seems suddenly just the thing. Indeed, Mme Pompadour herself has mentioned that champagne \"is the only wine that leaves a woman beautiful after drinking it\". </p> <p>But there still remains that cloudiness - a product of the second fermentation without which there would be no fizz in the first place. How do you remove the sediment without at the same time releasing all the gas? </p> <p>It took them another 100 years to work that one out, and many more to perfect the technique. All sorts of ruses were resorted to. Bottles were stored cork down and at an angle of 45 degrees in big wooden racks called pupitres. Once a day for two months, a riddler in some dismal cellar would rotate eachbottle a quarter of a turn, just to persuade the wretched sediment to settle on the inside of the cork. The dearest champagnes are still riddled by hand. </p> <p>My favourite trick is the freezing. In 1896, someone realised that if you plunge the end of the bottle into a freezing solution, the wine in the neck would form an icy plug that would trap the sediment prior to removal of the cork. But perhaps the champagne houses' greatest achievement of all lay in their early mastery of a brand new and infinitely powerful type of magic - advertising. </p> <p>No sooner had Eugene Mercier had his vast cellars excavated at Epernay than he hit on a brilliant idea. He would open them to the public. It was the start of something big. At the 1889 Universal Exhibition in Paris, his attention-seeking stunts caused almost as much of a stir as the Eiffel Tower. And at the 1900 exhibition, Mercier joined forces with the Lumi\u00e8ere Brothers to make the very first advertising film. </p> <p>Bubbly was on the brink of finding a mass market, and the rest, as they say, is tee-hee-hee.</p> <p><strong>On the grapevine</strong></p> <p> The English-speaking staff at the Office de Tourisme in Epernay will happily send you away with an armful of leaflets and brochures about the things to do in the region. </p> <p>There are chIteaux and chocolate factories, farm museums and boat trips - and enough champagne-related visits to keep you busy for several months. Some of these are open all year round, but many are closed at weekends until the beginning of May. </p> <p>The grape harvest usually starts in late September and, for three weeks, the vineyards are at their most attractive - and their most crowded. It's reckoned that around 60,000 people turn out to help pick the crop (mechanical harvesting is forbidden) and anyone thinking of just turning up and joining in should think again. </p> <p>A number of vineyards do work in partnership with the tourist office, however, and would-be pickers and treaders should write or telephone for details well in advance. </p> <p>A more peaceful way to take in the surroundings is to drive into the hills south of Epernay and follow the trail around 12 villages. Each village - these are quiet, ancient places with medieval churches and vine yards that spill into back gardens - has erected a painted sign depicting one of the stages in the tending of the vines.

      "body": "<p>When the Tate Gallery trustees commissioned the deeply impressive <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/modern/default.htm\" target=\"_new\">Tate Modern</a> from Swiss architects Herzog &amp; de Meuron five years ago, it was clear that reason had triumphed over emotion, and perhaps rightly so. Nicholas Serota, the Tate's impeccable director, was keen at heart to commission a brand new building - what might have been a British rival to Frank Gehry's crowd-pulling Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao. In his head, though, Serota knew that the conversion of London's Bankside power station, set directly across the Thames from St Paul's cathedral, was an ideal choice. </p> <p>This decommissioned temple of power offered masses of space and was relatively new. Begun in 1947, it was given a handsome makeover by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott (1880-1960), architect of Battersea power station, Waterloo Bridge, the red telephone box, Liverpool cathedral and the Guinness brewery in Park Royal, west London. It was completed as late as 1963 and puffed exhaust steam from its twin turbines through a tall single chimney high into the London cloudscape until it was shut down in 1981. The steel and brick structure was battleship- sound. The conversion to art gallery and the architects' direct and intelligent method of working won over every major conservation group. </p> <p>The location was superb. Brooding on the banks of the Thames beside the Globe theatre, Bankside power station was the architectural prow of the rapidly regenerating London borough of Southwark, one of the capital's poorest and oldest quarters. The borough was keen to house the new Tate. Just as the power station would be transformed into a modern art gallery, so the borough intended to rebrand itself - to use the political jargon that emerged in the mid-90s - with culture, not industry, to the fore. </p> <p>To cap it all, Southwark and the City of London decided to join hands across the river in the form of the nearly complete Millennium footbridge, designed by Norman Foster, Anthony Caro and the engineer Chris Wise. Tate Modern would thus be at the centre of a route through Southwark, across the Thames and via St Paul's to the City one way, the West End the other. How could the Tate go wrong? </p> <p>It did not. The site was acquired from Magnox plc in 1996, the super-smooth steam turbines were removed (sadly) and conversion work began the next year. The result is now almost ready to show to the public. How big this public will be perhaps no one really knows; it will certainly be in the millions, and the building is so vast and so solidly put together that it will take millions more each year to make Tate Modern feel anything like congested. </p> <p>The interior spaces are huge. Even artists who are used to working on an epic scale will find it a challenge to make an impression on the vast space set aside for temporary installations in the former turbine hall. This is now a gigantic entrance hall, 500ft long and 115ft high (the height of the vaults of our loftiest cathedrals). It is a truly public space. Commuters can walk through it on their way north and south across the river, taking in a glimpse of art, a coffee and London's biggest art bookshop (open late seven days a week) on the way. </p> <p>Jacques Herzog compares it to the great 19th-century galleria of Milan and Naples. But the big difference is that where the Galleria Vittorio Emmanuele in Milan and its counterparts elsewhere in Italy are exuberances of rich materials and colour, full of chic shops and cafes, Herzog and de Meuron's galleria is an austere space. It has something of a nuclear power station about it, or some Brobdingnagian railway station: Milan centrale looms to mind. Visitors here seem Liliputian, the tiniest actors upon an almost impossibly imposing stage. On one side is the three-level stack of galleries facing the river, punctuated by great bands of projecting windows set around with further bands of muted fluorescent light. It is cool, calculated, and deeply impressive. </p> <p>On the other side is the wall marked out by a regular rhythm of steel columns that separates the galleria and the galleries from the electricity distribution station that continues to hum on site, if out of sight. The hum acts as a kind of white noise, weird or rather wonderful, depending on your point of hearing. </p> <p>To the fore is a massive bridge at the centre of the galleria. This is the point where lifts and escalators meet and take visitors up to the long enfilades of painting and sculpture galleries. Beyond is the temporary exhibition space and above the dramatic internal hoist that rumbles the length of the galleria: once it lifted turbines, now Serras and other artistic heavyweights. </p> <p>Reconciling modern artworks, especially the latest installations, to the epic scale and horny-handed might of this former power station is initially peculiar. This was a blue-collar building, a mighty industrial heart pumping lifeblood through the arteries of the capital. I remember coming here as a child and hearing the turbines switched over. There were men in boiler suits, men in brown coats checking and men in white coats checking those checking. There were dials with red sections labelled \"Danger\"; gangways and steel stairs zig- zagging into an internal stratosphere; great shafts of murky industrial-era light groping through Scott's high windows. I remember the sheer sense of awe. All that barely contained energy. </p> <p>And now? There is a certain sense of detachment. Much of the art seems decadent to me - bourgeois playthings hung in a building that was once so vital to the working of its city. </p> <p>It can, though, be argued that London owes much of its appeal and energy, its continual reinvention of itself, to its inward investment in art and culture, to what Labour ministers call \"cultural industries\". The wall that separates the electricity supply station from Herzog &amp; de Meuron's chaste galleria is thus an unbreachable barrier between old and new London, soot and Serra, energy and Emin, mechanical and digital, cockneys and mockneys, modern and postmodern. </p> <p>This is not a criticism, but a feeling. The art on display is an eclectic collection - truly something for everyone - in precise white galleries, some with views out to St Paul's diffused by net curtain-like screens, others enclosed, like that displaying the intensely layered red and purple canvases of Mark Rothko. This parade of rooms - untreated oak floors, white walls, sturdy under foot grilles for heating and ventilation, broad strips of overhead light - would seem relentless if not for the sudden glazed cut-throughs and balconies that offer near-vertiginous views down into the galleria and its Liliputians and out through the massive west window. Sadly, here the view is of a rather unsuccessful miscegenation of second-rate buildings of the past four decades. Tate Modern looks down on them with a disdainful, unyielding eye. </p> <p>Herzog &amp; de Meuron have installed on top of the building, and from one end to the other, a restaurant with river views. Down below is a cafe and brasserie that can be reached without entering the Tate. This is a good idea. It means that, together with the other galleries, cafes, bars and new housing that are following in the titanic wake of the Tate, this great temple of art will work much as cathedrals did in the age of faith: a gathering of workaday buildings for those who toiled, spun and changed money around the walls of the dominant temple. Once the cathedrals dominated our cities, then, in the age of industry, it was the railway stations, now it is the art galleries and museums. </p> <p> According to the mellifluously titled Assessing the Economic Impact of the Tate Gallery of Modern Art at Bankside (1994) - prepared, says the Tate,\"with pro bono help\" from McKinsey &amp; Company - the \"Tate's development at Bankside has the potential to bring direct economic benefits to London of between \u00a350m and \u00a390m a year and will create 2,400 new jobs\". It may well do more than this. </p> <p>In short, if one can possibly use such a word where this enormous \u00a3134m gallery is concerned, Tate Modern is very impressive and will undoubtedly be a major success. What it does not do, however, is move the heart. This is not an emotional building such as, say, the Guggenheims: Frank Lloyd Wright's in Manhattan, Frank Gehry's in Bilbao. Wilful and even downright eccentric buildings, they are both rightly acclaimed, and designed around central cores or hearts. Galleries spin off from these emotional hubs. Theirs is an architecture in the round. </p> <p>By contrast, Tate Modern is linear, masculine and, if not without a powerful guiding spirit, literally heartless. This doesn't make it better or worse than the Guggenheims, just different. It is certainly a much bigger building than either, with masses of display space and a glorious collection of sometimes beautiful, sometimes provocative and sometimes irritating artworks. </p> <p>What shines through is the close, intelligent and trusting relationship between client and architects. Herzog &amp; de Meuron have been a perfect match for the dreams and ambition of Serota and his team. They knew what they wanted the Tate's giant offspring to be, got the right architects, and stood by them. When the going got tough, there was no running for cover or taking soft options. And out of it comes great architecture, whether warm or cool, whether ruled by heart or by the head. Tate Modern is truly heady stuff. </p> <p>\u0095 Tate Modern opens on May 12.</p>",

It was the first time detectives and relatives had joined forces in public in an attempt to discover the truth about how Errol McGowan, 34, and his nephew Jason, 20, died. Police also acknowledged that they were investigating racial incidents in Telford over the past 2 years. Errol was found hanging by an electric flex from a door in a friend's house in Telford on July 2 last year. Jason, who had privately been investigating his uncle's death, was found hanging from roadside railings on New Year's Day, four months after his marriage. Family members believe the two were possibly victims of a racist murder and earlier criticised original police investigators who presumed the deaths were suicides. The investigation has since been reopened, and Peter Hampson, chief constable of West Mercia, has apologised to the family. John Grieve, head of Scotland Yard's racial and violent crimes task force, is now advising West Mercia's detectives. Yesterday's press conference was designed as a public demonstration that the two sides have now resolved their differences and are working together on the investigation. Police support officers were present to assist Errol's mother, Icyline McGowan. Sitting with six family members, including Errol's partner and Jason's widow, Mr Grieve told the conference that police were investigating a range of potential criminal offences, including murder. \"The presumption is of foul play,\" he said. \"For instance, murder, manslaughter, complicity in another person's suicide, obstructing the coroner - all those kind of offences. \"There are a series of unanswered questions that the Mc Gowan family have been asking for six months.

      "bodyText": "Disgraced peer Lord Archer was arrested yesterday in connection with allegations that he conspired to pervert the course of justice. The arrest follows the former Conservative Party deputy chairman's admission last November that he asked a friend to lie during his libel action against the Daily Star over claims that he paid money to a prostitute. The new controversy forced Lord Archer, 59, to withdraw as the Conservative candidate for London mayor and he was subsequently expelled from the party for five years. The millionaire novelist attended a central London police station by appointment yesterday and was questioned for several hours by officers from Scotland Yard's organised crime squad. The questioning was led by Detective Superintendent Geoff Hunt, who headed the investigation into Jonathan Aitken's libel case perjury that culminated in the former minister being jailed for 18 months. Lord Archer was later released and bailed to reappear on an undisclosed date in June. In 1987 the Daily Star was ordered to pay Lord Archer \u00a3500,000 in damages and \u00a3700,000 in costs after alleging he had visited prostitute Monica Coghlan. But following new evidence from Ted Francis, a TV producer and former friend of the peer, the newspaper asked Scotland Yard to investigate whether Lord Archer had committed a criminal offence. Lord Archer has since admitted he was a \"fool\" to ask Mr Francis to say they were dining together during an evening when he was dining with \"a close personal friend\" and the Daily Star claimed he was with Ms Coghlan. In the event the false evidence was not required because the Daily Star changed the date it alleged the encounter with Ms Coghlan took place before the matter came to trial in 1987. The arrest comes at a time when Lord Archer had begun to rebuild his shattered reputation. A volume of his short stories was published last month, and he signed a new book deal worth \u00a310m with publishers HarperCollins. He was also working on a play called The Accused in which he planned to appear. Last night Lord Archer's former supporters were conspicuous by their silence. A spokesman for the Conservative Party said: \"It's nothing to do with us. He is not a member of the Conservative Party.\" Stephan Shakespeare, his former assistant, declined to comment, and Lord Archer himself said nothing after returning to his penthouse flat on the Thames. A spokeswoman for the Daily Star, which is demanding a \u00a33m repayment of the damages including interest and costs, said it was \"watching developments with great interest\".",

The big news in brain research is the \"use it or lose it\" hypothesis. The infant brain sprouts cells and synaptic connections at a phenomenal rate in the womb and the first year of life: a toddler has twice the number of neurons as an adult. This bulking up is then followed by two key processes. First there is a pruning to sculpt the brain's processing pathways; poorly placed or unneeded cells and connections die as the brain tunes itself into the sensory and motor world in which it finds itself.

Strap a tape recorder playing Mozart to the pregnant belly. Start teaching a foreign language by three; the brain will never learn to pronounce words like a native after that. Every second of infancy has to be turned into a learning experience because, by the time a child actually reaches school, its brain will already have solidified.</p> <p>Eliot strongly believes in the \"use it or lose it\" theory: everything from vision to memory, athleticism to empathy, has its critical period during which parents ought to be maximising their child's potential. But the facts she presents don't support her case, and in the end even she begins to vacillate. Take the \"enriched rat\" finding: as Eliot points out, the real story was that rats with a few toys and playmates in their cage were compared to rats growing up in barren isolation - neither environment being particularly mentally challenging compared to fending for yourself in a sewer. The studies only showed the relative impact of what would be considered impoverished, even abusive, upbringings in humans. </p> <p>After admitting that there is no good evidence that giving a child accelerated practice at sitting, walking, block-building or tricycle riding has any lasting effect on motor skills, Eliot wistfully concludes that great violinists and tennis players simply must have been helped by starting young. Similarly, after reviewing evidence that inhibited or anxious children tend to retain their basic temperament, Eliot finishes by urging parents to take on the job of \"limbic system tutor\", making sure all those little emotion circuits become wired as optimally as possible. </p> <p>There is some truth in what Eliot says. Children's brains can be damaged by bad parenting. Drinking, smoking and stress during pregnancy do take a toll, as does neglect or abuse during early years, and Eliot presents a comprehensive survey of recent research. While it is harder to prove some specific benefit of brain-targeted parenting, it is clear that infants do profit from early stimulation, especially in the area of speech - studies claim astonishing emotional and intellectual improvements in children whose parents have real conversations with them. </p> <p>However, the attempt to deliver any simple message always falls foul of the dichotomies concerning the brain and mental ability. For one thing, the adult human brain is remarkable for both its hard-wiring and its plasticity. Recent discoveries (which Eliot does not properly consider) have shown that the real key to the brain's power is its ability to accumulate intellectual habits while remaining simultaneously flexible in its response. So while it is true that low-level skills, such as vision and locomotion, do mature reasonably early, higher-level skills to do with thinking, remembering and anticipating stay plastic throughout life. The brain wins both ways; there is no suddenly closing window of opportunity for the mental abilities that really matter. </p> <p>Another dichotomy that cuts across Eliot's simple diagnosis is the culture/genes divide. Humans are the most plastic-brained of all species, as evidenced by our extreme helplessness as infants. And the reason for this plasticity seems to be to allow human culture to have its maximum effect on the shaping of our brains. It is not just language we learn, but the mental habits language enables. Human brains are forged from a mix of genetic and cultural evolution. In this equation, parenting matters, but mostly because parents act as the unwitting delivery vehicles for the standard package of thought rhythms and social norms - the memes - that have evolved within their culture. </p> <p>Unfortunately, Eliot does not touch on the wider story of brain development. She struggles to make her case for brain-targeted interventions and at the last moment loses her nerve, admitting that time, love and conversation are the true ingredients of parenting. So, push but don't push: the usual bland advice. However, one final throwaway remark does seem to hit the nail on the head: \"It is the model we set, rather than the specific teaching we attempt, that is going to have the biggest impact on a child's cognitive abilities and success in life.\" Change yourself if you want to change your child - now there's a message most parents really don't want to hear. </p> <p>How Babies Think, by Gopnik, Meltzoff and Kuhl, ought to be better. These three are leading researchers in the field of child cognitive development; standing between neurology and sociology, their view should be more balanced. Yet, oddly, the psychologists argue from even deeper prejudice. Their big idea is that babies are mini-adults, expert makers of their own intellectual worlds. Children are evolutionarily programmed to learn, as parents are programmed to teach; any form of hothousing is likely only to interfere with normal, natural parenting. </p> <p>A comforting message, but Gopnik et al are too quick to dismiss the complexities. As Eliot makes clear, babies are born with proto-brains, not mini-brains. Much of the higher brain - the cortex - is not even connected up in a way that could do work in the fashion the psychologists suggest. And they give little consideration to the brain-moulding effects of language and human culture, preferring a romantic vision of babies as emerging essentially entire from the womb. In moments of gushing prose, the fast-learning infant brain is even presented as distinctly superior to the fossilised circuits of its adult carers. </p> <p>These two books offer plenty of fascinating science, yet do little to cut through the modern dilemmas of parenting. Decent reading for the intellectually curious who want a glimpse of what is unfolding within their newborn's cranium; but perhaps the worried parent ought to steer well clear.</p>",

But it does not matter if they do it at four, or do not start until seven: far better than worrying yourself and them about decoding the squiggles, you should provide them with books that give complete experiences, that take them on wild journeys of the imagination, that offer them visual stimulus, and that make them laugh and think about the world around them.</p> <p>As soon as children do start reading, parents often think pictures are unnecessary. In fact they are crucial. Where would Roald Dahl's books be without the wacky line illustrations of Quentin Blake? And picture books that you enjoyed together when your child was a baby and toddler can get a new lease of life when she or he can read them for themselves: such books, loved and familiar, are more likely to enrich their life and help their reading than those written with that purpose in mind and with limited vocabularies to match.</p> <p>Because of the wide range of reading ability, the ages suggested below are a guide only and make no distinction between being read to and reading for one's self alone.</p> <p><strong>4 upwards</strong></p> <h2>I Hate School, by Jeanne Willis and Tony Ross (Anderson Press \u00a35.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504132\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2005/09/08/school1.jpg\" alt=\"I Hate School  by Jeanne Willis and Tony Ross\" width=\"128\" height=\"195\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=1842702203\">Buy I Hate School at the Guardian bookshop</a></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Honor Brown hates school, the worms the dinner ladies feed them, the smelly sand-pit, the killer sharks in the water tray.

A little picture book with a big wild heart.</p> <h2>My Uncle is a Hunkle Says Clarice by Lauren Child (Orchard, \u00a310.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504137\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2008/06/16/hunkle.jpg\" alt=\"My Uncle is a Hunkle, Says Clarice Bean by Lauren Child\" width=\"128\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Lauren Child has burst exuberantly upon children's publishing with her funny daffy stories about Clarice Bean, a small girl who is eight going on eighty-eighty and who lives in a very modern household that is always in uproar. The latest has a ticklish title and is a ticklish book with Child's trademark hurdy gurdy mixture of drawings, photos and clever typography - the words for driving to the hospital very fast are very squiggly. Other delicious titles include Clarice Bean, That's Me and I Will Not Never Eat a Tomato.</p> <h2>The It-Doesn't Matter Suit by Sylvia Plath (Faber \u00a33.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504138\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2000/10/19/itdoesntmattersuit2.jpg\" alt=\"It Doesn't Matter Suit 2\" width=\"128\" height=\"203\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Only it matters a lot to Max, youngest of seven brothers residing in the town of Winkelburg, that he is the only member of his family that hasn't got a suit. But when a mysterious parcel arrives and it turns out to be a mustard yellow suit, Max is the last in line for a particularly special hand-me-down. Plath's book has a charming, dead-pan humour that is matched by Rotraut Susanne Berner's illustrations.</p> <h2>The Sea-Thing Child by Russell Hoban, illustrated by Patrick Benson (Walker, \u00a310.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504139\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2000/10/19/seathingchild2.gif\" alt=\"Sea Thing Child 2\" width=\"128\" height=\"117\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Russell Hoban's superb 30-year-old classic about the terrible power of nature seen through the sea and shoreline and the eyes of the sea-thing child as he grows in experience and confidence. Patrick Benson's paintings marvellously capture the immensity of the sea and sky.</p> <h2>Josie Smith in Summer by Magdalen Nabb (Collins, \u00a33.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504140\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2000/10/19/josiesmith2.jpg\" alt=\"Josie Smith\" width=\"128\" height=\"194\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>One in a jolly little series of nine books that tell of the adventures of the irrepressible Josie, her family and friends. These books are not stunningly well-written or even particularly perceptive, but their charm is in their depiction of everyday life, the perils and pleasures of friendship, the cares and concerns of Josie and her quirky view of adult behaviour. Child-sized in every way and all the better for it, these are books for readers going solo for the first time.</p> <h2>Rosie's Babies by Martin Waddell and Penny Dale (Walker, \u00a34.50)</h2> <p>There are enchanting, highly detailed pastel pictures to accompany this story about four-year-old Rosie, trying to get her mum's attention while she puts the baby to bed. Rosie tells her own stories about her babies, bear and rabbit: how they make her cross, what she gives them to eat - apples, pears and grapes (but they do not like the pips). This is a great insight into the egocentric world of the small child and a gentle and sympathetic account of sibling rivalry.</p> <h2>The Cat in the Hat by Dr Seuss (Collins, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>We are in two minds about the world of Dr Seuss. We love the Cat in the Hat; we love it when The Cat in the Hat Comes Back, even naughtier than before. He is such a character - like the mad, bad, wild creature that lurks inside even the best behaved child - that you cannot help falling for him, even if the rhythm of the piece is irritatingly train-like. It is the other Dr Seuss titles that give us a problem. Is there a child in the world who really enjoys reading \"I am Sam and Sam I am?\" Sales suggest there are, but we bet it is parents anxious about their children reading, not children, who demand these titles.</p> <h2>Dogger by Shirley Hughes (Collins, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>A good story told with empathy for what it feels like to lose your favourite teddy - or, in this case, Dogger, a worn old dog that belongs to Dave. When Dave loses him at the school fete he only gets him back because of a generous gesture by his big sister, Bella.</p> <h2>The Mousehole Cat by Antonia Barber and Nicola Bayley (Walker, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>An utterly magical picture book with rich, vividly coloured illustrations, friezes and borders that complement Barber's simple, almost severe telling of the dramatic Cornish legend of Mowser the Cat and Tom, the old fisherman, who brave the fury of the Great Storm Cat to save their village from starving.</p> <h2>The Children of Lir by Shelia MacGill-Callahan (Ragged Bears, \u00a39.99)</h2> <p>What are almost pre-Raphaelite pictures accompany this retelling of the legend of the children of the king of Ireland who are turned into swans by their wicked stepmother. Writing and visuals set each other off to create a rich story about the making and breaking of spells and the sorrow of exile. A book for sharing.</p> <h2>The Snowman by Raymond Briggs (Penguin, \u00a39.99)</h2> <p>A classic story, told entirely without words, of the magical friendship between a boy and his frozen friend. Actually much improved by not having to listen to Walking On Air while watching the story unfold. If you like this, try The Bear - much the same except that the friend is furry.</p> <h2>Poems For the Very Young selected by Michael Rosen (Kingfisher, \u00a36.99)</h2> <p>An excellent collection to suit all tastes. Worth it alone for Jack Prelutsky's Spaghetti! Spaghetti! - the kind of nourishing poetry that four-year-olds really understand.</p> <h2>Twinkle Twinkle Chocolate Bar compiled by John Foster (OUP, \u00a37.99)</h2> <p>Some funny and some silly rhymes about swings and see-saws, cats and dogs, mums and dads, dragons and giants, and mudpie stew. Great fun.</p> <h2>The Owl and the Pussycat by Lewis Carroll and Edward Lear (OUP, \u00a35.99)</h2> <p>Nonsense rhymes by two of the greatest exponents, beautifully illustrated with rich Victorian-style illustrations by Nicki Palin.</p> <h2>The Teddy Robber by Ian Beck (Corgi, \u00a33.99)</h2> <p>Someone is stealing Teddies; Tom is determined to find out who, and is in for a giant surprise. This story is a mini-adventure for the very young with illustrations that play cleverly with size and perspective to give a sense of what it is like to be small in a big world.</p> <h2>Avocado Baby by John Burningham (Red Fox, \u00a34.50)</h2> <p>This story tickles the sense of humour of the very young, and follows a weedy baby in a weedy family who beats the bullies when it starts on a diet of avocado pears.</p> <h2>Willy's Pictures by Anthony Browne (Walker, \u00a310.99)</h2> <p>There is something completely clear-eyed and honest about the way Browne views the world of families and children. In the brilliant Zoo (Red Fox, \u00a34.50), he charts a day out in which it is the humans who behave like the zoo's animals. This book is just as original, with Browne recreating some of the world's most famous paintings, adding to each his best-loved character, Willy the chimp. Magritte, Dali, Rousseau and Edward Hopper all get the monkey treatment; the results are funny and disturbing at the same time.</p> <h2>The Tale of Peter Rabbit by Beatrix Potter (Puffin, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>Large-format version of the classic tale about the disobedient little rabbit in Mr McGregor's garden who almost ends up as stew.<br> </p> <h2>Reckless Ruby by Hiawyn Oram (Carnival, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>Ruby's parents think she is so precious that they want to wrap her in cotton wool. Ruby has other ideas, and decides that only by being reckless can she avoid this terrible fate. Crucial reading for little girls who do not want to grow up to marry princes.</p> <h2>Winnie the Witch by Korky Paul and Valerie Thomas (OUP, \u00a33.99)</h2> <p>A Children's Book Award winner that full of visual jokes and amusing detail. Winnie the Witch decides that having a black cat when you live in an all-black house is very confusing.</p> <h2>Not Now, Bernard by David McKee (Red Fox, \u00a33.99)</h2> <p>One of those books that stays in the mind. Bernard would like a little attention from his parents, but they are so busy they do not even notice that he has been eaten and replaced by a monster. McKee's sly pictures are so delicious you want to gobble them up. A stark reminder that there is no such thing as quality time.</p> <h2>Princess Smartypants by Babette Cole (Puffin, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>This princess enjoys being a Ms, but all the princes want her to be their Mrs. A feminist fairytale with a difference, full of good humour. If you enjoy this, try Cole's gender-bending variation on the Cinderella story, Prince Cinders.</p> <h2>Mrs Wobble the Waitress by Allan Alberg (Puffin, \u00a33.99)</h2> <p>One in a series of user-friendly and funny stories that help children learn to read without patronising either them or their parents. Our favourites are Mr Biff the Boxer, Mr Tick the Teacher, and Mrs Jolly's Joke Shop, from which most children learn their first knock knock joke.</p> <h2>Something Else by Kathryn Cave and Chris Riddell. (Puffin, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>Elsie tries and fails to be like everyone else, then something completely different turns up and wants to be friends. A gentle, eloquently told story about the meaning of tolerance.</p> <h2>Winnie the Pooh by AA Milne (World International, \u00a34.95)</h2> <p>Your children may well have been introduced to Pooh, Christopher Robin and the \"100 aker wood\" long before reaching four, but now is the time to start reading them the full version with colour illustrations by EH Shepard. Just don't try to imitate Alan Bennett when you do.</p> <p><strong>5 upwards</strong></p> <h2>The Magic Finger by Roald Dahl (Puffin, \u00a33.99)</h2> <p>The little girl in this fantasy has a unique gift. When someone makes her angry she simply points her finger and - zap! - an instant punishment is visited on the offender. When her teacher calls her \"a stupid little girl\" because she misspells cat, she points her finger and her teacher sprouts whiskers. Quite right! A small child used to being coerced will warm to the summary justice meted out in this tale. A little book with a great big message about the enormity of small children's feelings.</p> <h2>The Jolly Postman or Other People's Letters by Janet and Allan Ahlberg (Puffin, \u00a311.99)</h2> <p>Children are intrigued by this highly original book containing witty cards in envelopes for the Jolly Postman to deliver to fairytale characters. Hours and hours of fun.</p> <p><strong>6 upward</strong></p> <h2>The Dinosaur's Packed Lunch by Jacqueline Wilson (Corgi, \u00a33.50)</h2> <p>A great story about a little girl who is looked after by her dad, and has the day from hell on a school visit to the dinosaur museum. Things look up when she turns into a dinosaur, although being scaly-skinned brings its own problems. A perceptive story from an author likely to figure large in your child's reading over the years.</p> <p>Advanced readers could also try Cliffhanger (\u00a33.99), a good read about Tim, a boy who is hopeless at sport and, to his horror, is sent away on an adventure holiday.</p> <h2>Mossycoat by Philip Pullman (Scholastic, \u00a31)</h2> <p>A brilliant, simple idea - and talk about value for money! A series of well-known tales retold by some of the best writers around; each is just fantastic and at \u00a31 very affordable. We have not seen one that is not beautifully, sometimes heart-breakingly, written or wittily illustrated. Besides Pullman's dark vision of the girl whose mum made her a mossy coat, you can get Anne Fine's version of the Twelve Dancing Princesses, Gillian Cross's exquisitely simple telling of the Goose Girl, Berlie Dohert's the Snow Queen, and Henrietta Branford's creepy Hansel and Gretel. The list grows longer, parents more thankful. Begin by reading them to your children, and the older ones will start collecting them themselves with their pocket money.</p> <h2>The Enormous Crocodile by Roald Dahl (Puffin, \u00a35.99)</h2> <p>A golloping, gulping, grumptious story from the master storyteller, concerning a horrid, greedy, brutish crocodile who has secret plans and clever tricks to fill up his tummy with a yummy child. Will make them scream with laughter.</p> <h2>The Adventures of Mr Toad by Kenneth Grahame, abridged and illustrated by Inga Moore (Walker \u00a314.99)</h2> <p>An introduction to the riotous adventures of the wayward toad. Full colour illustrations.</p> <p><strong>7 upward</strong></p> <h2>The Enchanted Horse by Magdalen Nabb (Collins, \u00a33.50)</h2> <p>Irina is a sad and lonely child; the wooden horse she sees in a junk shop is sad and lonely too, and needs a home. Nabb's book is a superb internalised dialogue, a modern fairytale in which the horse comes alive and liberates Irina from the burden of her sadness. Seven upward. In a different vein, Nabb has written a very enjoyable series of stories about a funny, feisty little girl called Josie Smith (Collins, \u00a33.99). Heart-warming without being twee. Six upward.</p> <h2>The Hundred-Mile-An-Hour Dog by Jeremy Strong (Puffin, \u00a33.99)</h2> <p>A Children's Book Award winner that tells about Streaker, a rocket on four legs with a woof attached. Children giggle uncontrollably at the humour, and it will raise a smile in mums and dads as well. Seven upward. Strong is prolific, although the quality of his work is variable, and confident seven-year-old readers will love Lightening Lucy (Puffin, \u00a33.99) about a little girl who can fly, a sort of miniature Wonderwoman.</p> <h2>Snow White and the Seven Aliens by Laurence Anholt (Orchard, \u00a33.99)</h2> <p>A seriously silly retelling of the story in which Snow White is a wannabe pop star who has to defeat the mean queen, who was once the lead singer with The Wonderful Witched Witches. Parents may sigh, but children find it hilarious. Great pictures.</p> <h2>The Worst Witch by Jill Murphy (Puffin, \u00a33.99)</h2> <p>This is the place where for most little girls real reading begins. Few can resist Mildred Hubble, the little witch at Miss Cackle's academy who is always crashing her broomstick and getting her spells wrong. Much copied but not bettered. There are three more.</p> <h2>Mr Majeika by Humphrey Carpenter (Puffin, \u00a33.99)</h2> <p>First in a witty series about class three, who get a bit of a shock when their new teacher does not enter by the door but flies in through the window. But then, Mr Majeika is a wizard, albeit one for whom things are always going wrong. Not much sub-text, but real page turners and plenty of other tales the series to satisfy ravenous readers.</p> <h2>Bill's New Frock by Anne Fine (Mammoth, \u00a33.99)</h2> <p>When Bill Simpson wakes up one Monday morning he finds he is a girl, and his mum packs him off to school in a frilly pink frock. So begins one of the worst days of his life. A gender-bending fable that is a great feminist romp for the over-sevens.</p>",

      "bodyText": "This is probably the most difficult age to choose for. There has been a huge boom in books for this age group; but sadly a very high proportion are not about reading but about learning to read, which is something entirely different. As a parent it is hard not to be swept into the learning-to-read race, although it is worth reminding yourself that (unless your child has some undiagnosed condition) they will eventually learn to read, just as they once learned to walk, talk and use the potty; it is just that some do it quicker than others. But it does not matter if they do it at four, or do not start until seven: far better than worrying yourself and them about decoding the squiggles, you should provide them with books that give complete experiences, that take them on wild journeys of the imagination, that offer them visual stimulus, and that make them laugh and think about the world around them. As soon as children do start reading, parents often think pictures are unnecessary. In fact they are crucial. Where would Roald Dahl's books be without the wacky line illustrations of Quentin Blake? And picture books that you enjoyed together when your child was a baby and toddler can get a new lease of life when she or he can read them for themselves: such books, loved and familiar, are more likely to enrich their life and help their reading than those written with that purpose in mind and with limited vocabularies to match. Because of the wide range of reading ability, the ages suggested below are a guide only and make no distinction between being read to and reading for one's self alone. 4 upwards I Hate School, by Jeanne Willis and Tony Ross (Anderson Press \u00a35.99) Honor Brown hates school, the worms the dinner ladies feed them, the smelly sand-pit, the killer sharks in the water tray. But what do you know? Come the end of year six, she is in tears at the thought of leaving. For all who are starting school this week, and for their parents who need a laugh. Bunny Cakes by Rosemary Wells (Picture Corgi, \u00a34.99) It is impossible not to fall in love with Max the tearaway toddler rabbit who gives his rather bossy big sister Ruby a pretty hard time. Max causes mayhem in the kitchen when Ruby decides to make a cake for grandma's birthday, and gets to have his cake and eat it in the shape of red hot marshmallow squirters for his earthworm surprise cake. It is very simple, smart and sassy and the shopping lists get even the very young reading. Owl Babies by Martin Waddell, illustrated by Patrick Benson (Walker, \u00a34.99) Dealing in a really imaginative way with the idea of separation from the mum you really love, this is a wonderful book that makes you feel cosy just to think about it. Benson's illustrations have a wonderful expressive quality. A Squash and a Squeeze by Julia Donaldson, illustrated by Axel Scheffler (Mammoth, \u00a34.99) Endearingly dotty version of old English folk tale about a woman who thinks that her house is too small, and so it proves when the farmyard animals turn up. The text is simple and silly and the illustrations capture the sense of ordinary life gone mad. The Big Big Sea by Martin Waddell , illustrated by Jennifer Eachus (Walker, \u00a34.99) One of those intensely magical books in which words and pictures come together to create a portrait of the world that is just a little bit different. It is a book about the importance of the very smallest things in life. A little picture book with a big wild heart. My Uncle is a Hunkle Says Clarice by Lauren Child (Orchard, \u00a310.99) Lauren Child has burst exuberantly upon children's publishing with her funny daffy stories about Clarice Bean, a small girl who is eight going on eighty-eighty and who lives in a very modern household that is always in uproar. The latest has a ticklish title and is a ticklish book with Child's trademark hurdy gurdy mixture of drawings, photos and clever typography - the words for driving to the hospital very fast are very squiggly. Other delicious titles include Clarice Bean, That's Me and I Will Not Never Eat a Tomato. The It-Doesn't Matter Suit by Sylvia Plath (Faber \u00a33.99) Only it matters a lot to Max, youngest of seven brothers residing in the town of Winkelburg, that he is the only member of his family that hasn't got a suit. But when a mysterious parcel arrives and it turns out to be a mustard yellow suit, Max is the last in line for a particularly special hand-me-down. Plath's book has a charming, dead-pan humour that is matched by Rotraut Susanne Berner's illustrations. The Sea-Thing Child by Russell Hoban, illustrated by Patrick Benson (Walker, \u00a310.99) Russell Hoban's superb 30-year-old classic about the terrible power of nature seen through the sea and shoreline and the eyes of the sea-thing child as he grows in experience and confidence. Patrick Benson's paintings marvellously capture the immensity of the sea and sky. Josie Smith in Summer by Magdalen Nabb (Collins, \u00a33.99) One in a jolly little series of nine books that tell of the adventures of the irrepressible Josie, her family and friends. These books are not stunningly well-written or even particularly perceptive, but their charm is in their depiction of everyday life, the perils and pleasures of friendship, the cares and concerns of Josie and her quirky view of adult behaviour. Child-sized in every way and all the better for it, these are books for readers going solo for the first time. Rosie's Babies by Martin Waddell and Penny Dale (Walker, \u00a34.50) There are enchanting, highly detailed pastel pictures to accompany this story about four-year-old Rosie, trying to get her mum's attention while she puts the baby to bed. Rosie tells her own stories about her babies, bear and rabbit: how they make her cross, what she gives them to eat - apples, pears and grapes (but they do not like the pips). This is a great insight into the egocentric world of the small child and a gentle and sympathetic account of sibling rivalry. The Cat in the Hat by Dr Seuss (Collins, \u00a34.99) We are in two minds about the world of Dr Seuss. We love the Cat in the Hat; we love it when The Cat in the Hat Comes Back, even naughtier than before. He is such a character - like the mad, bad, wild creature that lurks inside even the best behaved child - that you cannot help falling for him, even if the rhythm of the piece is irritatingly train-like. It is the other Dr Seuss titles that give us a problem. Is there a child in the world who really enjoys reading \"I am Sam and Sam I am?\" Sales suggest there are, but we bet it is parents anxious about their children reading, not children, who demand these titles. Dogger by Shirley Hughes (Collins, \u00a34.99) A good story told with empathy for what it feels like to lose your favourite teddy - or, in this case, Dogger, a worn old dog that belongs to Dave. When Dave loses him at the school fete he only gets him back because of a generous gesture by his big sister, Bella. The Mousehole Cat by Antonia Barber and Nicola Bayley (Walker, \u00a34.99) An utterly magical picture book with rich, vividly coloured illustrations, friezes and borders that complement Barber's simple, almost severe telling of the dramatic Cornish legend of Mowser the Cat and Tom, the old fisherman, who brave the fury of the Great Storm Cat to save their village from starving. The Children of Lir by Shelia MacGill-Callahan (Ragged Bears, \u00a39.99) What are almost pre-Raphaelite pictures accompany this retelling of the legend of the children of the king of Ireland who are turned into swans by their wicked stepmother. Writing and visuals set each other off to create a rich story about the making and breaking of spells and the sorrow of exile. A book for sharing. The Snowman by Raymond Briggs (Penguin, \u00a39.99) A classic story, told entirely without words, of the magical friendship between a boy and his frozen friend. Actually much improved by not having to listen to Walking On Air while watching the story unfold. If you like this, try The Bear - much the same except that the friend is furry. Poems For the Very Young selected by Michael Rosen (Kingfisher, \u00a36.99) An excellent collection to suit all tastes. Worth it alone for Jack Prelutsky's Spaghetti! Spaghetti! - the kind of nourishing poetry that four-year-olds really understand. Twinkle Twinkle Chocolate Bar compiled by John Foster (OUP, \u00a37.99) Some funny and some silly rhymes about swings and see-saws, cats and dogs, mums and dads, dragons and giants, and mudpie stew. Great fun. The Owl and the Pussycat by Lewis Carroll and Edward Lear (OUP, \u00a35.99) Nonsense rhymes by two of the greatest exponents, beautifully illustrated with rich Victorian-style illustrations by Nicki Palin. The Teddy Robber by Ian Beck (Corgi, \u00a33.99) Someone is stealing Teddies; Tom is determined to find out who, and is in for a giant surprise. This story is a mini-adventure for the very young with illustrations that play cleverly with size and perspective to give a sense of what it is like to be small in a big world. Avocado Baby by John Burningham (Red Fox, \u00a34.50) This story tickles the sense of humour of the very young, and follows a weedy baby in a weedy family who beats the bullies when it starts on a diet of avocado pears. Willy's Pictures by Anthony Browne (Walker, \u00a310.99) There is something completely clear-eyed and honest about the way Browne views the world of families and children. In the brilliant Zoo (Red Fox, \u00a34.50), he charts a day out in which it is the humans who behave like the zoo's animals. This book is just as original, with Browne recreating some of the world's most famous paintings, adding to each his best-loved character, Willy the chimp. Magritte, Dali, Rousseau and Edward Hopper all get the monkey treatment; the results are funny and disturbing at the same time. The Tale of Peter Rabbit by Beatrix Potter (Puffin, \u00a34.99) Large-format version of the classic tale about the disobedient little rabbit in Mr McGregor's garden who almost ends up as stew. Reckless Ruby by Hiawyn Oram (Carnival, \u00a34.99) Ruby's parents think she is so precious that they want to wrap her in cotton wool. Ruby has other ideas, and decides that only by being reckless can she avoid this terrible fate. Crucial reading for little girls who do not want to grow up to marry princes. Winnie the Witch by Korky Paul and Valerie Thomas (OUP, \u00a33.99) A Children's Book Award winner that full of visual jokes and amusing detail. Winnie the Witch decides that having a black cat when you live in an all-black house is very confusing. Not Now, Bernard by David McKee (Red Fox, \u00a33.99) One of those books that stays in the mind. Bernard would like a little attention from his parents, but they are so busy they do not even notice that he has been eaten and replaced by a monster. McKee's sly pictures are so delicious you want to gobble them up. A stark reminder that there is no such thing as quality time. Princess Smartypants by Babette Cole (Puffin, \u00a34.99) This princess enjoys being a Ms, but all the princes want her to be their Mrs. A feminist fairytale with a difference, full of good humour. If you enjoy this, try Cole's gender-bending variation on the Cinderella story, Prince Cinders. Mrs Wobble the Waitress by Allan Alberg (Puffin, \u00a33.99) One in a series of user-friendly and funny stories that help children learn to read without patronising either them or their parents. Our favourites are Mr Biff the Boxer, Mr Tick the Teacher, and Mrs Jolly's Joke Shop, from which most children learn their first knock knock joke. Something Else by Kathryn Cave and Chris Riddell. (Puffin, \u00a34.99) Elsie tries and fails to be like everyone else, then something completely different turns up and wants to be friends. A gentle, eloquently told story about the meaning of tolerance. Winnie the Pooh by AA Milne (World International, \u00a34.95) Your children may well have been introduced to Pooh, Christopher Robin and the \"100 aker wood\" long before reaching four, but now is the time to start reading them the full version with colour illustrations by EH Shepard. Just don't try to imitate Alan Bennett when you do. 5 upwards The Magic Finger by Roald Dahl (Puffin, \u00a33.99) The little girl in this fantasy has a unique gift. When someone makes her angry she simply points her finger and - zap! - an instant punishment is visited on the offender. When her teacher calls her \"a stupid little girl\" because she misspells cat, she points her finger and her teacher sprouts whiskers. Quite right! A small child used to being coerced will warm to the summary justice meted out in this tale. A little book with a great big message about the enormity of small children's feelings. The Jolly Postman or Other People's Letters by Janet and Allan Ahlberg (Puffin, \u00a311.99) Children are intrigued by this highly original book containing witty cards in envelopes for the Jolly Postman to deliver to fairytale characters. Hours and hours of fun. 6 upward The Dinosaur's Packed Lunch by Jacqueline Wilson (Corgi, \u00a33.50) A great story about a little girl who is looked after by her dad, and has the day from hell on a school visit to the dinosaur museum. Things look up when she turns into a dinosaur, although being scaly-skinned brings its own problems. A perceptive story from an author likely to figure large in your child's reading over the years. Advanced readers could also try Cliffhanger (\u00a33.99), a good read about Tim, a boy who is hopeless at sport and, to his horror, is sent away on an adventure holiday. Mossycoat by Philip Pullman (Scholastic, \u00a31) A brilliant, simple idea - and talk about value for money! A series of well-known tales retold by some of the best writers around; each is just fantastic and at \u00a31 very affordable. We have not seen one that is not beautifully, sometimes heart-breakingly, written or wittily illustrated. Besides Pullman's dark vision of the girl whose mum made her a mossy coat, you can get Anne Fine's version of the Twelve Dancing Princesses, Gillian Cross's exquisitely simple telling of the Goose Girl, Berlie Dohert's the Snow Queen, and Henrietta Branford's creepy Hansel and Gretel. The list grows longer, parents more thankful. Begin by reading them to your children, and the older ones will start collecting them themselves with their pocket money. The Enormous Crocodile by Roald Dahl (Puffin, \u00a35.99) A golloping, gulping, grumptious story from the master storyteller, concerning a horrid, greedy, brutish crocodile who has secret plans and clever tricks to fill up his tummy with a yummy child. Will make them scream with laughter. The Adventures of Mr Toad by Kenneth Grahame, abridged and illustrated by Inga Moore (Walker \u00a314.99) An introduction to the riotous adventures of the wayward toad. Full colour illustrations. 7 upward The Enchanted Horse by Magdalen Nabb (Collins, \u00a33.50) Irina is a sad and lonely child; the wooden horse she sees in a junk shop is sad and lonely too, and needs a home. Nabb's book is a superb internalised dialogue, a modern fairytale in which the horse comes alive and liberates Irina from the burden of her sadness. Seven upward. In a different vein, Nabb has written a very enjoyable series of stories about a funny, feisty little girl called Josie Smith (Collins, \u00a33.99). Heart-warming without being twee. Six upward. The Hundred-Mile-An-Hour Dog by Jeremy Strong (Puffin, \u00a33.99) A Children's Book Award winner that tells about Streaker, a rocket on four legs with a woof attached. Children giggle uncontrollably at the humour, and it will raise a smile in mums and dads as well. Seven upward. Strong is prolific, although the quality of his work is variable, and confident seven-year-old readers will love Lightening Lucy (Puffin, \u00a33.99) about a little girl who can fly, a sort of miniature Wonderwoman. Snow White and the Seven Aliens by Laurence Anholt (Orchard, \u00a33.99) A seriously silly retelling of the story in which Snow White is a wannabe pop star who has to defeat the mean queen, who was once the lead singer with The Wonderful Witched Witches. Parents may sigh, but children find it hilarious. Great pictures. The Worst Witch by Jill Murphy (Puffin, \u00a33.99) This is the place where for most little girls real reading begins. Few can resist Mildred Hubble, the little witch at Miss Cackle's academy who is always crashing her broomstick and getting her spells wrong. Much copied but not bettered. There are three more. Mr Majeika by Humphrey Carpenter (Puffin, \u00a33.99) First in a witty series about class three, who get a bit of a shock when their new teacher does not enter by the door but flies in through the window. But then, Mr Majeika is a wizard, albeit one for whom things are always going wrong. Not much sub-text, but real page turners and plenty of other tales the series to satisfy ravenous readers. Bill's New Frock by Anne Fine (Mammoth, \u00a33.99) When Bill Simpson wakes up one Monday morning he finds he is a girl, and his mum packs him off to school in a frilly pink frock. So begins one of the worst days of his life. A gender-bending fable that is a great feminist romp for the over-sevens.",

You always wanted to run a bar.' </p> <p>\"It was like a complete bolt from the blue - I'd got so caught up in exams and moving up the career ladder that I'd forgotten all about my real dreams and ambitions.\" </p> <p>\"It's very common for people in their 20s to feel they are in the wrong job,\" says Professor Ben Fletcher, dean of the Business School at Hertfordshire University. </p> <p>\"Many people are unsure about what they want to do when they leave college and so take the first job that comes along which sounds vaguely interesting and has a decent salary. Years later, they find themselves stuck in a career that doesn't suit them, trapped by their position and income.\" </p> <p>It can seem a huge risk to give up a secure job for an uncertain future - but employers are becoming increasingly flexible about previous experience and are happy to take on people from unrelated fields. </p> <p>\"Any good employer looks for two main factors in a prospective employee - suitability and eligibility,\" says chartered corporate psychologist Ben Williams. \"Eligibility in terms of past experience and relevant qualifications, suitability in relation to their character, personality and whether they have the right sort of interpersonal skills for the job. </p> <p>\"Although the ideal is to have a combination of both, it's perfectly possible to land a job with only suitability - which many employers now see as more important than relevant qualifications.\" </p> <p>Lack of experience was a big cause of anxiety for Justin Lovett who, after three years in banking, decided that he had to get out. </p> <p>\"I had huge debts after university and the salaries offered by banking seemed huge,\" he says. \"For the first year it was great - the novelty of having money and going out and about in London was a total change from student life. </p> <p>\"But gradually I realised that the job itself was dull and frustrating - and the thought of still being in the same field in 10 years time made me feel really depressed.\" </p> <p>In one way, Justin was fortunate in that he knew what he wanted to do. \"I've always been fascinated by new technology and I wanted to work for an internet company. I took a night school course in the computer language HTML and spent hours at home on my computer learning and researching about the web. </p> <p>\"I used up loads of my holiday allowance going for interviews, but finally landed a job in the production department of a website design company. It was a lot less money - most of the people I worked with thought I was mad - but after six months I got promoted and instead of dreading going to work, now I positively look forward to it.\" </p> <p>Both Justin and Cindy had to deal with negative reactions from friends and family when they decided to shift careers - and this is often one of the main reasons why people can remain in the wrong job. </p> <p>\"Everyone is constrained, to some degree, by their personal history and situation,\" says Professor Fletcher. \"People may worry that their family will be disappointed in them, or they compare their career success to other people and feel they don't measure up. </p> <p>\"Others feel that changing careers may be seen as sign of weakness or lack of commitment. The only way to overcome these feelings is to focus on what is the right thing for you - regardless of what others will say or think.\" </p> <p>Cindy Jefferies agrees. \"I had a couple of really bad arguments with my Dad, who couldn't believe what I'd done. There were moments in the first few months, when I'd been on my feet for five hours a night and took home \u00a3150 a week, that I did worry if it was all going to work out. </p> <p>\"But now, two years on, that I'm running my own wine bar he's really proud - he can see how much happier I am.\" </p> <p>French philosopher Bertrand Russell summed it up when he said: \"Success is getting what you want, happiness is wanting what you get.\" </p> <p><strong>If you don't remember anything else, remember this...</strong></p> <p>Work isn't just about doing something you're good at, it's also about doing something that makes you happy. Take control - go on a course, write 'on spec' letters, focus on what you really want - and don't let anyone put you off.</p>",

Years later, they find themselves stuck in a career that doesn't suit them, trapped by their position and income.\" It can seem a huge risk to give up a secure job for an uncertain future - but employers are becoming increasingly flexible about previous experience and are happy to take on people from unrelated fields. \"Any good employer looks for two main factors in a prospective employee - suitability and eligibility,\" says chartered corporate psychologist Ben Williams. \"Eligibility in terms of past experience and relevant qualifications, suitability in relation to their character, personality and whether they have the right sort of interpersonal skills for the job. \"Although the ideal is to have a combination of both, it's perfectly possible to land a job with only suitability - which many employers now see as more important than relevant qualifications.\" Lack of experience was a big cause of anxiety for Justin Lovett who, after three years in banking, decided that he had to get out. \"I had huge debts after university and the salaries offered by banking seemed huge,\" he says. \"For the first year it was great - the novelty of having money and going out and about in London was a total change from student life. \"But gradually I realised that the job itself was dull and frustrating - and the thought of still being in the same field in 10 years time made me feel really depressed.\" In one way, Justin was fortunate in that he knew what he wanted to do. \"I've always been fascinated by new technology and I wanted to work for an internet company. I took a night school course in the computer language HTML and spent hours at home on my computer learning and researching about the web. \"I used up loads of my holiday allowance going for interviews, but finally landed a job in the production department of a website design company. It was a lot less money - most of the people I worked with thought I was mad - but after six months I got promoted and instead of dreading going to work, now I positively look forward to it.\" Both Justin and Cindy had to deal with negative reactions from friends and family when they decided to shift careers - and this is often one of the main reasons why people can remain in the wrong job. \"Everyone is constrained, to some degree, by their personal history and situation,\" says Professor Fletcher. \"People may worry that their family will be disappointed in them, or they compare their career success to other people and feel they don't measure up. \"Others feel that changing careers may be seen as sign of weakness or lack of commitment. The only way to overcome these feelings is to focus on what is the right thing for you - regardless of what others will say or think.\" Cindy Jefferies agrees. \"I had a couple of really bad arguments with my Dad, who couldn't believe what I'd done. There were moments in the first few months, when I'd been on my feet for five hours a night and took home \u00a3150 a week, that I did worry if it was all going to work out. \"But now, two years on, that I'm running my own wine bar he's really proud - he can see how much happier I am.\" French philosopher Bertrand Russell summed it up when he said: \"Success is getting what you want, happiness is wanting what you get.\" If you don't remember anything else, remember this... Work isn't just about doing something you're good at, it's also about doing something that makes you happy. Take control - go on a course, write 'on spec' letters, focus on what you really want - and don't let anyone put you off.",

The worst things that can happen are the trick question or the unexpected test, but even these can be anticipated to some degree, say employment specialists.

And you have paid them the compliment of being deeply interested in them which is always a winner.</p> <p>Sources for company information are even easier to access now that any organisation worth working for has a website. However, the website will only tell you what the company wants you to know. It is also worth looking in the Companies' House Register which is policed by the Department of Trade and Industry and gives information on limited companies, including their latest reports. The register should be on microfiche at any decent sized library. General business and trade directories will also provide information and you must make sure you read any literature which has been sent along with your application form. If the job you are applying for has a professional body, get in touch and ask for any information they can supply about employment in their field, and let your interviewer know you have done this.</p> <p>The other part of being prepared is, in a sense, to research yourself - because that is what the interviewer will be doing with you. \"Work out from what you know about the job what are the key selling points about yourself that you want to get across,\" says Catherine Gilbert of recruitment agency Drake Beam Marin (DBM). \"And be prepared to back up those points. For instance, if you say you are very creative, be prepared to give examples of where you have used that creativity.\"</p> <p>Professor Gavin Kennedy, of Heriot Watt Business School, says it is good to have a strategy to sell your strong points. So, job hunters should write down a \"benefit\" next to each part of their CV before attending the interview and plan to talk about how that is relevant to the job. As well as being prepared, you need to be positive about the company or organisation, and about yourself, although not insanely so. A favourite question is: \"Have you any weaknesses?\" John Waddingham, author of The Job's Yours, advises interviewees to say that they have no weaknesses which would affect their performance in the job that is on offer. Saying you have none is arrogance.</p> <p>Another area which can be a minefield if you are moving from one job to another is your reason for leaving your present post. You might be tempted to tell the truth - the job's a nightmare, your boss a tyrant, your pay is lousy. Even criticism of your present job gives you a chance to be positive. A bit of spin can change the nightmare job into one which does not offer enough of a challenge, a tyrannical boss can be transformed into a lack of opportunity to progress and if you are looking for more money, you're ambitious and you value what you will bring to the company.</p> <p> Professor Kennedy says interviewees must bring the positive spin to every part of their history, even a period of unemployment. \"Focus on what you learned or gained from that period, even if it was not the happiest time,\" he says. \"Interviewers will appreciate honesty. I think it is fair to say that things were not going well - as long as you can show that something positive came out of it.\"</p> <p>There is clearly a danger in overselling yourself, but don't undersell yourself either. \"Always go into the interview ready to get to the next stage of the process,\" advises DBM's Catherine Gilbert. \"You must focus on getting your selling points across. Don't undersell yourself because you think it might not be the job for you. Give it your best shot. You can always turn down an offer.\"</p> <p>These are the personality and skills part of the interview, but your stunning character will count for nothing if you fail to observe the basics. First impressions count. (Be punctual, be pristine and be polite.) John Waddingham warns interviewees to look keen even in the waiting room - the receptionist and other staff may be watching to judge your attitude and report back to the employer.</p> <p>In this era of greater informality, dress has become a variable. Catherine Gilbert advises dressing appropriately, although bear in mind it is traditional to dress up somewhat for an interview. \"While you wouldn't probably turn up in a suit for businesses known for casual dress, such as advertising, graphics or public relations, you would still dress smart casual - the sort of thing you would wear on behalf of the company,\" she advises. \"And if you are being introduced by a recruiter, ask them what you think is appropriate.\"</p> <p>And you have your body language to consider. John Waddingham points out that poor body language creates an immediate barrier and cites sitting with your arms folded which can be interpreted as saying that you are in charge or that you are hiding something. He advises the nervous against retreating into their private space, but warns against anything which might look like an invasion of your interviewer's space, such as leaning too far forward across the desk or standing too closely. But lean forward slightly to show interest in what the interviewer is saying. Avoid unnecessary gestures and don't let your gaze wander. If your gaze is wandering, your mind is probably wandering too and this is a situation where you should pay 100% attention. <br>And last impressions count as well. Don't forget those final moments when you will be asked if you have any questions. Be prepared for this, keep a little back, otherwise you are in danger of spoiling what might have been a good interview with a last lack-lustre \"Oh, I can't think of anything.\" This is where you can show you can think on your feet and pick up some of the points made by the interviewer, explains Professor Kennedy. \"It's also good to ask about the timing of promotion and training opportunities and show that you expect the company to play its part,\" he says.

Juliet was played by an American man. She sat on the branch of a beech tree grimly clutching a window box. It was, quite possibly, meant to be the balcony scene. His gangly legs, swathed in tights, were very nearly knock-kneed. His wig might well have been trimmed with shears. He was the spitting image of Emo Phillips, that now nearly forgotten proto-alternative comic. She, too, looked like Emo Phillips, but with a skirt, all of which did nothing for me. </p> <p>\"Call me butt love,\" said this American Romeo to Juliet on her makeshift balcony. She raised a sarcastic eyebrow higher and higher until he corrected his mistake. \"Call me but love and I'll be new baptised.\" </p> <p>The thing, ultimately, with Shakespeare, is that you have to stay true to the verse. Otherwise you wind up calling yourself butt love. \"What I was taught,\" said Peter Hall during The Genius of Shakespeare, \"was that Shakespeare wrote in lines, not words, that the iambic pentameter, which is like the system under a piece of jazz, has a strong rhythm and needs marking as a line, and that great Shakespeare playing is, as we would say now, exactly like great jazz playing: you keep the beat, you understand the beat, you preserve the line, but it's how you nearly break the line which enables you to express the emotion.\" The great British actors - Gielgud, Richardson, Edith Evans, Arthur Mullard etc - all knew this, if not instinctively, then rather because their acting culture was imbued with the jazz-like sensitivity to verse mastery. </p> <p>Good points, lessons learned over a career of directing our greatest playwright in the best theatres in the land. But lessons that have been cast aside by the Reduced Shakespeare Company. \"What's in a name anyway?\" Juliet told Romeo from her branch. \"That which we call a nose would still smell.\" </p> <p>The company's specially commissioned TV production of Romeo and Juliet in the Woods would not suit purists. When Tybalt and Romeo fought, for instance, they proved their masculinity by means of table football. Next, Tybalt smacked Romeo around a bit with giant boxing gloves. Romeo retorted by twisting one of Tybalt's nipples with a huge spanner, which must have smarted. Tybalt picked up his pencil sharpener, a model so big that it fitted over Romeo's sword arm. He then twisted and twisted and twisted. Again, that probably hurt a great deal. When Tybalt was dispatched, we cut to a stuffed hare. He, or perhaps she, was the moral conscience of this scene, and looked as upset as only a stuffed hare can. </p> <p>Here's something distressing that the famous Shakespearean, Professor Harold Bloom, told me only the other day. I don't think he'll mind me quoting him in full. \"Recently, Shakespeare went into a pub. He walked up to the bar and asked for a drink. 'Oi! I've told you before,' said the publican, 'you're Bard!'\" It comes to something, doesn't it, when our greatest playwright is refused admission to some seedy boozer? It shows, quite clearly to my mind, that we need a full evening of Shakespeare programming on telly to restore him to his cultural pre-eminence. </p> <p>And so it was. Last night on BBC Knowledge was A Night in With Shakespeare. There was an interesting documentary about the 20-year restoration and reconstruction of the Globe theatre in Southwark, a programme about an experiment to persuade people in inner-city Birmingham to rehearse and perform Shakespeare's work, a Trevor Nunn-directed production of Macbeth starring Ian McKellen and Judi Dench, and more. In addition, there was allied information on <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/knowledge/arts/shakespeare\">www.bbc.co.uk/knowledge/arts/shakespeare</a>, with the full panoply of audio clips, quick time videos and nice graphics. It is great to see the BBC doing this kind of stuff. Particularly great that it does so on a digital channel that hardly anybody has access to. Especially so when you see that at the same time on BBC2 there was two hours of golf from Augusta, a documentary about the Grand National and Gardeners' World. Marvellous stuff. </p> <p>In The Genius of Shakespeare, there was one particularly lovely moment. Vanessa Redgrave recalled that she used to listen to old 78s of her father, Michael, and Dame Edith Evans playing Orlando and Rosalind in As You Like It. That was how she learned to speak Shakespearean lines properly. We cut to a 1940 production. Redgrave's Orlando had turned up late for his tryst and Evans's Rosalind told him off. \"Break a promise in love!\" said Evans's Rosalind in unison with Vanessa's Rosalind from a 1968 production, then Vanessa carried on the speech wonderfully, having learned her lesson well.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Its thirtysomething first-time director has been feted worldwide, and last month it became the most successful British film ever made, but if Barry Norman is to be believed, it will not win a Bafta tomorrow night. </p> <p>No, not the Oscar-winning Sam Mendes and his American Beauty, but East Is East, a small-budget comedy about an Anglo-Asian family who run a Salford fish and chip shop, which with little or no media fanfare became the surprise hit of last year, taking \u00a310.3m at the box office. </p> <p>Although the film has seven Bafta nominations, including best director for Damien O'Donnell and best screenplay for Ayub Khan Din, few critics are betting on it taking any of the top awards. </p> <p>That East Is East has become the highest grossing fully British funded film ever should in itself make it worthy of a Bafta, its producer Leslee Udwin said. </p> <p>\"It is all very well giving Baftas to big American films, but we should be standing up for films that were actually made here with British money. All along, the film was written off as a small or Asian film when it was neither and every time it has confounded people. Barry Norman's predictions, I notice, have us winning nothing. Very few others are tipping us, but we may surprise everybody.\" </p> <p>It is one of the Baftas' perennial problems. Whether they should grandstand truly British films as the French do with their C\u00e9sars, or simply be a low-rent version of the Oscars, held a few weeks after the main event, where big Hollywood winners get a chance to take a second bow. </p> <p>British writers, actors, directors and costume and set designers again dominate this year, but almost all were working on American or US-funded films. The other major exception is Mike Leigh's Gilbert and Sullivan costume drama, Topsy-Turvy. </p> <p>Tim Angel, the director of the Baftas - which have this year been renamed the Orange British Academy Film Awards - said that narrow nationalism has never been their way. </p> <p>\"You can't be jingoistic about this because so much of the talent these days on big Hollywood films is British, never mind the writers, actors and directors. There are no frontiers in the film business any more. It would also damage the credibility of the Baftas if we were seen to favour purely British films like the French do with their C\u00e9sars,\" he said. \"You can't deny the money is American in a lot of films nominated this year, but the talent is British.\" </p> <p>Barry Norman described East Is East as a \"smashing\" movie. \"I wouldn't be surprised if it sneaked best newcomer for Ayub Khan Din, but you are on terribly dangerous ground if you allow nationality to be the arbiter,\" he added. \"Money makes all the difference, and that is an area where British films suffer.\" </p> <p>The Baftas' major problem was their timing, he said. \"So often they are just trotting along placidly in the wake of the Oscars. It would be more fun it they were before them.\" </p> <p>With 14 nominations, there is an air of inevitability about American Beauty.

      "bodyText": "Its thirtysomething first-time director has been feted worldwide, and last month it became the most successful British film ever made, but if Barry Norman is to be believed, it will not win a Bafta tomorrow night. No, not the Oscar-winning Sam Mendes and his American Beauty, but East Is East, a small-budget comedy about an Anglo-Asian family who run a Salford fish and chip shop, which with little or no media fanfare became the surprise hit of last year, taking \u00a310.3m at the box office. Although the film has seven Bafta nominations, including best director for Damien O'Donnell and best screenplay for Ayub Khan Din, few critics are betting on it taking any of the top awards. That East Is East has become the highest grossing fully British funded film ever should in itself make it worthy of a Bafta, its producer Leslee Udwin said. \"It is all very well giving Baftas to big American films, but we should be standing up for films that were actually made here with British money. All along, the film was written off as a small or Asian film when it was neither and every time it has confounded people. Barry Norman's predictions, I notice, have us winning nothing. Very few others are tipping us, but we may surprise everybody.\" It is one of the Baftas' perennial problems. Whether they should grandstand truly British films as the French do with their C\u00e9sars, or simply be a low-rent version of the Oscars, held a few weeks after the main event, where big Hollywood winners get a chance to take a second bow. British writers, actors, directors and costume and set designers again dominate this year, but almost all were working on American or US-funded films. The other major exception is Mike Leigh's Gilbert and Sullivan costume drama, Topsy-Turvy. Tim Angel, the director of the Baftas - which have this year been renamed the Orange British Academy Film Awards - said that narrow nationalism has never been their way. \"You can't be jingoistic about this because so much of the talent these days on big Hollywood films is British, never mind the writers, actors and directors. There are no frontiers in the film business any more. It would also damage the credibility of the Baftas if we were seen to favour purely British films like the French do with their C\u00e9sars,\" he said. \"You can't deny the money is American in a lot of films nominated this year, but the talent is British.\" Barry Norman described East Is East as a \"smashing\" movie. \"I wouldn't be surprised if it sneaked best newcomer for Ayub Khan Din, but you are on terribly dangerous ground if you allow nationality to be the arbiter,\" he added. \"Money makes all the difference, and that is an area where British films suffer.\" The Baftas' major problem was their timing, he said. \"So often they are just trotting along placidly in the wake of the Oscars. It would be more fun it they were before them.\" With 14 nominations, there is an air of inevitability about American Beauty. But Mendes may face stiffer opposition at home than he did in Hollywood. The Baftas often depart from the script. Last year The Truman Show - ignored at the Oscars - won best film. Neil Jordan has 10 nominations for The End Of The Affair and Anthony Minghella's underrated The Talented Mr Ripley may also emerge from the pack. Barry Norman is tipping Topsy-Turvy for best British film while the smart money is on Russell Crowe (The Insider) and Jim Broadbent (Topsy-Turvy) for best actor.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>At the University of Sarajevo, Aleksandar Hemon had an English professor who introduced him to the great works of world literature. And, as time went by, the aspiring young writer would present his own efforts to the great man, who, in turn, was only too happy to nurture his favourite student. Professor Nikola Koljevic taught Hemon just about everything he knew about the world of letters, but his most important lesson - and the most devastating - came later. </p> <p>When the killing started in the former Yugoslavia, the erudite and admired professor took up the banner of the most bloodthirsty killers. </p> <p>Koljevic, a Shakespeare specialist, became Radovan Karadzic's smooth-tongued deputy in the Serb Democratic Party and helped run the ethnic-cleansing machine in Bosnia. He spent the war laughing off reports of massacres, smiling as he denied the existence of death camps. And, in a twist Shakespeare himself would have appreciated, Koljevic the man of letters masterminded the bombing of Sarajevo's revered library. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the student - who had become a refugee in Chicago - looked on in dismay as his former mentor mutated on television into an absurd, chauvinist caricature. Hemon's mother was a Bosnian Serb, but, like her, he had never felt any strong affiliation with the new Serb nationalism. When pressed, he identified himself as Ukrainian - a reference to his father's roots, and exotic enough to be neutral at a time when ethnicity was taking on lethal significance. </p> <p>\"I tried to detect the moment when he [Koljevic] crossed the line,\" Hemon said. \"When did it happen? What were the signs? Should I have known? I re-read things he liked, to see how they were in retrospect. Because I thought if you liked literature and you could quote Shakespeare, you're a good person. At least you couldn't possibly be bad. I learnt that was not true.\" Thus endeth Koljevic's last lesson. After the war was over, the ex-academic sank deeper into a stupor of alcohol and denial, muttering about the past slights he imagined at the hands of his former academic colleagues, who were by then either dead, emotionally shattered or in exile. </p> <p>Then, one winter's day in January 1997, the great Koljevic shot himself in the head. In fact, he shot himself twice in the head - a feat that led many to wonder about the official verdict of suicide. But, either way, his days as a Shakespearean authority were over. </p> <p>Thousands of miles away, his favourite student spent the early years of the war in the utmost misery. Hemon was cut off from his family and friends who were still trapped in Bosnia as the blood began to flow. He had been betrayed by his literary mentor, and by everything he thought literature represented. He was an immigrant with no money, doing odd-jobs in a strange country where he spoke only a tourist phrase-book version of the language. </p> <p>Fast-forward eight years to present-day O'Hare Airport, Chicago. The big, burly 35-year-old with close-cropped brown hair waiting for my plane to arrive is tipped to be the \"new Nabokov\" - an outsider who has come to English as a second language and shown us how it should be written. Awards are beginning to fall on him like the first snow in a long winter. His stories have been published in the New Yorker and the latest prestigious collection of Best American Short Stories. This week, his first book will be published in Britain. It is a novella and a collection of stories entitled The Question Of Bruno, and it is generating near-messianic excitement in the publishing world, which fought over the rights in the highest-grossing auction for a literary work last year - \u00a3154,000. </p> <p>The book is a satirical, often surreal, meander through a family's half-remembered, half-imagined history, from the Soviet Gulag to Yugoslavia's woeful past to the life of an exile in millennial Chicago. It is cut up into a series of episodes as different from each other as they are from the rest of current English fiction. Yet, by the end, the book feels like a single work. The stories are connected by common themes - the displacement and mixed allegiances of the outsider - as well as characters and places that seep from one tale to the next, like the irrepressible Hemon dynasty itself. It is semi-autobiographical, in that many of the details are authentic, but they have been rearranged in the interests of literature rather than of history - \"a consequence of irresponsible imagination and shameless speculation,\" as Hemon describes it in one of his stories. </p> <p>Thus, the doomed Archduke Franz Ferdinand - as he is driven through the streets of Sarajevo on his way to being shot by the assassin Gavrilo Princip - can catch the eye of a smiling accordionist in the crowd who turns out to be Hemon's great-grandfather. The great-grandfather, the accordion and Princip himself all make guest appearances in other stories, as if they were all members and props in Hemon's touring troupe. </p> <p>The early reactions to The Question Of Bruno have verged on the religious, particularly from Hemon's fellow writers. The remarks of US-based Irish writer Colum McCann typify the general tone. \"Anarchic, yet beautifully controlled,\" he said. \"In fact it is difficult to find the proper words with which to praise this book - it creates a sort of awed silence around itself.\" </p> <p>Hype and hyperbole are the flesh and blood of publishing, but Picador has indeed stuck its neck out on Hemon's future, putting down an extraordinary amount of cash for a debut volume. And Hemon is drawing praise from people whose whole lives have revolved around the crafting of the English language. So the real question here is: How? Most native-born writers hear English from their days in the womb and spend their lives crafting clauses, polishing paragraphs. Yet they can only dream of the sort of acclaim now piled on Hemon. </p> <p>Vladimir Nabokov, one of Hemon's literary heroes, had an easy transition by comparison. He grew up in Russia, but in a trilingual household speaking English and French as well as Russian. Nabokov read Browning and Keats as a child, and studied at Cambridge long before he arrived in the US as a refugee. Hemon - or Sasha as everyone calls him - is an engineer's son whose family always spoke Serbo-Croat (Bosnian, as it is now called in post-war Bosnia) and still do in their present exile. His extraordinary accomplishment is really comparable only to the career of Joseph Conrad, who taught himself to write English as a deckhand in the merchant navy. But Hemon even has a few points on the revered Polish novelist. While Conrad was plunged into an English-speaking institution (the navy), Hemon was a mere refugee, one of many in an immigrant-filled city where most get by for years on the sort of tourist pidgin he arrived with. </p> <p>Hemon's deep, nonchalant Balkan accent is still audible. It rumbles along in its shoulder-shrugging way as he chats about his new life in Chicago. He speaks the language with relish and a sense of appreciation, the same way he writes. However, he points out that his transformation from a struggling Bosnian writer to a successful English author was not some effortless, overnight miracle. First, he had to overcome the illusion, commonplace among refugees, that the war would somehow turn out to be a mere misunderstanding and that he would soon be on a flight home. </p> <p>Hemon had found himself in the US almost by accident, having been on a government goodwill tour for aspiring foreign writers when the fighting erupted. He had been due to fly home on May 1, 1992, the first day of Sarajevo's four-year siege. He sat dumbfounded in front of CNN on a friend's television set. The next few weeks were a blur of tormented transatlantic calls from public pay phones to his family living in Sarajevo. \"I walked around with a pocket full of coins,\" he said. \"The summer of '92 was the worst. People didn't know what to do - how to hide from the snipers. I had no idea what I should do. My father said, 'Stay away.' Then my mother would say something like, 'Oh, the shooting is less than it was yesterday.'\" Hemon took his father's advice and stayed in the US, while his parents found their own way out. (They left for Canada in 1993, having slipped out of Sarajevo for Serb-controlled Banja Luka at the beginning of the city's siege.) Their escape lifted some of the personal urgency from Hemon's situation, but it did not diminish the soul-destroying impact of one atrocity after another in a multicultural republic where people used to get along. The nadir of his exile came with the discovery of the horrific Serb prison camps at Omarska and Trnopolje, where Bosnian Muslims were starved, tortured and executed. </p> <p>\"I was devastated by the camps,\" Hemon said. \"I walked around thinking I should get some help. I was even thinking about going to a psychiatrist, but what are they going to say - 'Think positive'? But it should upset you. If it doesn't, then there's something wrong with you.\" Instead of seeing a shrink, Hemon performed a sort of amputation on himself, severing his ties with the Bosnian language and with his past as a writer. He simply stopped trying to record his thoughts in his mother tongue, notifying his putative employer, Dani magazine in Sarajevo - a feisty, independent journal that documented the war - that he would not be writing any further columns on the grounds that he had nothing relevant to say. </p> <p>\"I couldn't write in Bosnian any more,\" Hemon said. \"Dani called me to ask me to write things, like film reviews. I said I can't write in Bosnian. I was off. Bosnia was off. My Bosnian was pre-war Bosnian.\" From that moment on, Hemon vowed, he would write exclusively in a language with which he had hitherto had only a colloquial acquaintance. It was a rash act, but Senad Pecanin, Dani's editor and an old Sarajevo friend, was not altogether surprised. \"It was a typical thing for Sasha to do. He is a fanatic. A completely impractical person,\" Pecanin said over the phone, getting quite worked up over the impressive degree of his friend's impracticality. \"He is predestined to be either a very successful writer, or a complete disaster. There was no chance of him being an average journalist somewhere.\" </p> <p>The chronically unworldly Hemon started keeping a diary written in his tourist's English, and set about expanding his literary vocabulary in the most direct way he could think of - by following in Nabokov's footsteps. \"I got myself a copy of Lolita, and I underlined every word I didn't understand, and then I would look them up,\" he said. \"At the beginning it took a very long time, because there were eight or ten underlined words on every page and I looked up the words in the Oxford English Dictionary for Advanced Learners, which has inscriptions and pictures, and some of the words in Lolita weren't in this dictionary.\" </p> <p>Hemon soon ventured far beyond Lolita, becoming possessed by what he calls the \"library demons\". \"I read everything all the time,\" he said, all the while obsessively hoarding his stock of words. He transcribed them on to hundreds of index cards, and if he could not immediately remember a word he had already looked up, he would punish himself with the laborious process of leafing through the weighty dictionary once more. The hoard became a \"mental warehouse\" of industrial proportions, jammed with a bookish vocabulary that went far beyond the requirements of his employment - which, at that time, consisted of going door to door raising funds for Greenpeace. He would drop words such as \"thwart\" and \"hirsute\" into his casual banter, and then wonder why his would-be contributors looked at him as if he were a salesman from Mars. He learnt his next lesson: \"Every word has its context. You have to learn the context.\" Memorising an entire language by rote was an arduous and often dispiriting process, and for a long while, Hemon found himself in the tongue-tied limbo of the hapless exile. \"I was between languages for three years. I couldn't write in Bosnian or in English. Whatever I said in English, I was lying, cheating. I was misrepresenting myself.\" </p> <p>Eventually, however, Hemon's obsessive dictionary-diving and stockpiling of index cards began to bring results in the deep linguistic recesses of his mind. \"I would catch myself using words that I didn't know I knew,\" he said. \"Not only did I begin to think in English, I dreamt in English, and I even remembered in English. I remembered things that happened in Sarajevo as if they happened in English.\" Hemon had given himself five years to write a publishable story in English, and he ended up achieving his goal in three. In 1995, he wrote an unusual contemplation about espionage, called The Sorge Spy Ring. It contained two narratives in one: on the top of the page was a part-autobiographical account of his own childhood suspicions that his father was a Soviet agent (fictionalised by a d\u00e9nouement in which the poor man is actually carted off to jail). Below, in the form of a series of historical footnotes, is the true story of Richard Sorge, a German diplomat in Japan who passed on Nazi secrets to Moscow, only to have his warnings of imminent invasion disregarded by Stalin. </p> <p>Together, the halves constitute a meditation on mixed and complex allegiances - a recurring motif in Hemon's work and life: as a Ukrainian-Serb hybrid in Bosnia when ethnic tensions were at their height eight years ago, and more recently as an immigrant trying to fit in while retaining a distinct identity. \"What attracted me was the multiple identity of Sorge,\" Hemon says. \"The idea of 'legend' - a spy's story of his imaginary life. My previous life was my 'legend'. I could say anything about my life, and no one would know it wasn't true. I didn't do it, because I was worried I would get out of control.\" </p> <p>Hemon submitted the Sorge story to Reginald Gibbons, writer and teacher at Chicago's Northwestern University who was also the editor of the US literary journal, TriQuarterly. The piece had rough edges, but in Gibbons' eyes it stood out as fresh and innovative. \"I liked him very much and I was also interested in his way of working,\" Gibbons said. \"We liked the same writers, such as Bruno Schulz and Danilo Kis. Both are outside the mainstream, and both are writers who wrote not in a straight-ahead way but who tried to capture the unrealistic nature of life. </p> <p>\"Sasha also used these modes outside realism - footnotes, mindgames, telescoping of time - devices that are an attempt to get a hold of a complex and absurd reality . . . I wish there were more American-born writers who would venture out of the realistic box. We seem to need infusions of Sashas.\" Gibbons also saw Hemon's natural advantage. By coming to the language from outside, he was all the more respectful of its quirks and its peculiar noises, like someone using a car for the first time. \"He's had a great ear for the way language is used, and he is very, very gifted,\" said Gibbons. \"It gives him a place to stand which English speakers don't have. Most writers are somewhat lazy and don't listen to what they write. He has a way of hearing English one word at a time.\" </p> <p>The remark chimed with something that Hemon said once over the phone. The way he put it was, \"In English, I have the linguistic sensibility of a child, and the mind of an adult.\" Hemon did not expect to be greeted like Nabokov's second coming, and has no aspirations to leave his Edgewater home in the Chicago suburbs, nor give up his weekend football games with Uptown United - a bunch of fellow immigrants from around the globe, who knock the ball about, yelling in mutually unintelligible versions of English. </p> <p>A diehard Liverpool FC supporter in a country that has never heard of Anfield or the Kop, Hemon says, \"It was only after I started playing football and writing that I realised I could in fact live in the United States\". But get him on the subject of the current state of English-language fiction and he sounds as arrogant and dismissive as any London literary lord. He does not mean to, and occasionally apologises for giving that impression, but he insists he is simply being straightforward. </p> <p>However, when he did learn to comprehend English, he found very little to excite him in contemporary writing. When he first hungrily picked up some modern US short stories, he found himself throwing the book across the room. \"There was such carelessness about language,\" he explained. \"It was sloppy. And there was that unfortunate tendency towards Hemingway-style minimalism. You remove all the adjectives. I don't believe in that. I believe in Nabokov's way. You pile them up until the object is formed completely.\" </p> <p>By now, Hemon was sitting at his favourite local Italian joint and audibly warming to the theme. His second beef was that he initially found very little US or British writing that is about anything. In the comfortable world of the west at the turn of the century, it seemed as though there was nothing to write about except middle-class ennui. \"There seemed to be a lack of ambition. There were stories about commuter marriages and mid-life crises. I thought maybe I don't understand this. Maybe it's the language, the culture, but I don't think so. If I'm a good writer, it's because I'm a good reader. I was reading and there was nothing there,\" he says. \"I don't expect them to write about war, but it was so unambitious, as if it was their hobby, as if they didn't need to write stories. I felt I needed to write stories and I couldn't.\" </p> <p>Now he can, and has, and is, for the time being, happy with what he's produced. \"I wrote this book the way I wanted it,\" he said at one point during an afternoon-long conversation in Chicago. Hemon believes he is a better writer now in English than he ever was in Bosnian, because of what he has experienced in between: the destruction of his country and life in exile. He checked himself, and pointed out that his problems as a refugee had never been comparable to those who endured Sarajevo's bloody siege, in which 10,000 are thought to have been killed. He is, after all, happily married to an American writer and journalist, and \"comfortable\" with his mixed identity. \"One thing I don't want to do,\" he declares with a sudden surge of feeling, \"is to claim I am the voice of Bosnian suffering.\" </p> <p>Yet everything Hemon writes is unmistakably flavoured by Bosnia in all its modern ages - from the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand through the long years of Tito's rule to a golden period of a few brief years between the extinction of communism and the explosion of rabid nationalism, when Sarajevo flowered as an exciting and magnetic cultural centre. The number of Hemon's contemporaries to have settled around the world as successful writers, artists and film-makers is phenomenal. To be creative as a generation, Hemon argued, \"you have to have a sense that the old order is not valid any more. I had a sense that the previous generations used it up, used their chance up.\" </p> <p>During his spell as cultural editor on Dani, he refused to allow anyone older than 27 to write for the magazine, despite the pleas of his friend and editor, Senad Pecanin. For Pecanin, too, those years - the late 80s, 1990 and 1991 - were a golden era. \"Sasha belongs to a good generation of poets, film-makers, and writers right before the war,\" he said. \"At the time, we couldn't imagine a war. Who could attack us, we thought. How stupid.\" </p> <p>Many of those who spent much of 1991 partying are still astonished at their own disregard for the menace looming over Bosnia. Hemon explains it this way: \"There is a psychological mechanism in human beings which doesn't allow them to imagine their own demise. But the imagination of evil people exceeds the imagination of good people.\" </p> <p>The sense of history lurking beneath the present is a key element of the central European experience. It is this history that has condemned the Hemon family to be perpetual outsiders since they arrived in Bosnia from Ukraine. For Sasha, in his story Exchange Of Pleasant Words, the family's rootlessness weighs like a punishment for some past transgression: \"Perhaps this is the punishment: we have to live these half-lives of people who cannot forget what they used to be and who are afraid of being addressed in a foreign language, no longer able to utter anything truly meaningful.\" </p> <p>It is, Hemon argues, immigrants and outsiders, with their blurred affiliations, who are positioned to write the best prose, because they are one step removed from both a society's language and its everyday reality. It is something he did not fully appreciate when he was Professor Koljevic's favourite student. But Koljevic, while helping to turn a million Bosnians into refugees, also gave Hemon a unique outsider's perspective, and taught him that history counts. </p> <p>\"Before, I didn't see any difference between history and fiction. It was a typical nihilist point of view,\" he said. \"What I later realised was that history came and bumped me on the head, but I should have paid attention all along.\" </p> <p>\u0095 The Question Of Bruno, by Aleksandar Hemon, is published by Picador on April 21 at \u00a312.99.

When pressed, he identified himself as Ukrainian - a reference to his father's roots, and exotic enough to be neutral at a time when ethnicity was taking on lethal significance. \"I tried to detect the moment when he [Koljevic] crossed the line,\" Hemon said. \"When did it happen? What were the signs? Should I have known? I re-read things he liked, to see how they were in retrospect. Because I thought if you liked literature and you could quote Shakespeare, you're a good person. At least you couldn't possibly be bad. I learnt that was not true.\" Thus endeth Koljevic's last lesson. After the war was over, the ex-academic sank deeper into a stupor of alcohol and denial, muttering about the past slights he imagined at the hands of his former academic colleagues, who were by then either dead, emotionally shattered or in exile. Then, one winter's day in January 1997, the great Koljevic shot himself in the head. In fact, he shot himself twice in the head - a feat that led many to wonder about the official verdict of suicide. But, either way, his days as a Shakespearean authority were over. Thousands of miles away, his favourite student spent the early years of the war in the utmost misery. Hemon was cut off from his family and friends who were still trapped in Bosnia as the blood began to flow. He had been betrayed by his literary mentor, and by everything he thought literature represented. He was an immigrant with no money, doing odd-jobs in a strange country where he spoke only a tourist phrase-book version of the language. Fast-forward eight years to present-day O'Hare Airport, Chicago. The big, burly 35-year-old with close-cropped brown hair waiting for my plane to arrive is tipped to be the \"new Nabokov\" - an outsider who has come to English as a second language and shown us how it should be written. Awards are beginning to fall on him like the first snow in a long winter. His stories have been published in the New Yorker and the latest prestigious collection of Best American Short Stories. This week, his first book will be published in Britain. It is a novella and a collection of stories entitled The Question Of Bruno, and it is generating near-messianic excitement in the publishing world, which fought over the rights in the highest-grossing auction for a literary work last year - \u00a3154,000. The book is a satirical, often surreal, meander through a family's half-remembered, half-imagined history, from the Soviet Gulag to Yugoslavia's woeful past to the life of an exile in millennial Chicago. It is cut up into a series of episodes as different from each other as they are from the rest of current English fiction. Yet, by the end, the book feels like a single work. The stories are connected by common themes - the displacement and mixed allegiances of the outsider - as well as characters and places that seep from one tale to the next, like the irrepressible Hemon dynasty itself. It is semi-autobiographical, in that many of the details are authentic, but they have been rearranged in the interests of literature rather than of history - \"a consequence of irresponsible imagination and shameless speculation,\" as Hemon describes it in one of his stories. Thus, the doomed Archduke Franz Ferdinand - as he is driven through the streets of Sarajevo on his way to being shot by the assassin Gavrilo Princip - can catch the eye of a smiling accordionist in the crowd who turns out to be Hemon's great-grandfather. The great-grandfather, the accordion and Princip himself all make guest appearances in other stories, as if they were all members and props in Hemon's touring troupe. The early reactions to The Question Of Bruno have verged on the religious, particularly from Hemon's fellow writers. The remarks of US-based Irish writer Colum McCann typify the general tone. \"Anarchic, yet beautifully controlled,\" he said. \"In fact it is difficult to find the proper words with which to praise this book - it creates a sort of awed silence around itself.\" Hype and hyperbole are the flesh and blood of publishing, but Picador has indeed stuck its neck out on Hemon's future, putting down an extraordinary amount of cash for a debut volume. And Hemon is drawing praise from people whose whole lives have revolved around the crafting of the English language. So the real question here is: How? Most native-born writers hear English from their days in the womb and spend their lives crafting clauses, polishing paragraphs. Yet they can only dream of the sort of acclaim now piled on Hemon. Vladimir Nabokov, one of Hemon's literary heroes, had an easy transition by comparison. He grew up in Russia, but in a trilingual household speaking English and French as well as Russian. Nabokov read Browning and Keats as a child, and studied at Cambridge long before he arrived in the US as a refugee. Hemon - or Sasha as everyone calls him - is an engineer's son whose family always spoke Serbo-Croat (Bosnian, as it is now called in post-war Bosnia) and still do in their present exile. His extraordinary accomplishment is really comparable only to the career of Joseph Conrad, who taught himself to write English as a deckhand in the merchant navy. But Hemon even has a few points on the revered Polish novelist. While Conrad was plunged into an English-speaking institution (the navy), Hemon was a mere refugee, one of many in an immigrant-filled city where most get by for years on the sort of tourist pidgin he arrived with. Hemon's deep, nonchalant Balkan accent is still audible. It rumbles along in its shoulder-shrugging way as he chats about his new life in Chicago. He speaks the language with relish and a sense of appreciation, the same way he writes. However, he points out that his transformation from a struggling Bosnian writer to a successful English author was not some effortless, overnight miracle. First, he had to overcome the illusion, commonplace among refugees, that the war would somehow turn out to be a mere misunderstanding and that he would soon be on a flight home. Hemon had found himself in the US almost by accident, having been on a government goodwill tour for aspiring foreign writers when the fighting erupted. He had been due to fly home on May 1, 1992, the first day of Sarajevo's four-year siege. He sat dumbfounded in front of CNN on a friend's television set. The next few weeks were a blur of tormented transatlantic calls from public pay phones to his family living in Sarajevo. \"I walked around with a pocket full of coins,\" he said. \"The summer of '92 was the worst. People didn't know what to do - how to hide from the snipers. I had no idea what I should do. My father said, 'Stay away.' Then my mother would say something like, 'Oh, the shooting is less than it was yesterday.'\" Hemon took his father's advice and stayed in the US, while his parents found their own way out. (They left for Canada in 1993, having slipped out of Sarajevo for Serb-controlled Banja Luka at the beginning of the city's siege.) Their escape lifted some of the personal urgency from Hemon's situation, but it did not diminish the soul-destroying impact of one atrocity after another in a multicultural republic where people used to get along. The nadir of his exile came with the discovery of the horrific Serb prison camps at Omarska and Trnopolje, where Bosnian Muslims were starved, tortured and executed. \"I was devastated by the camps,\" Hemon said. \"I walked around thinking I should get some help. I was even thinking about going to a psychiatrist, but what are they going to say - 'Think positive'? But it should upset you. If it doesn't, then there's something wrong with you.\" Instead of seeing a shrink, Hemon performed a sort of amputation on himself, severing his ties with the Bosnian language and with his past as a writer. He simply stopped trying to record his thoughts in his mother tongue, notifying his putative employer, Dani magazine in Sarajevo - a feisty, independent journal that documented the war - that he would not be writing any further columns on the grounds that he had nothing relevant to say. \"I couldn't write in Bosnian any more,\" Hemon said. \"Dani called me to ask me to write things, like film reviews. I said I can't write in Bosnian. I was off. Bosnia was off. My Bosnian was pre-war Bosnian.\" From that moment on, Hemon vowed, he would write exclusively in a language with which he had hitherto had only a colloquial acquaintance. It was a rash act, but Senad Pecanin, Dani's editor and an old Sarajevo friend, was not altogether surprised. \"It was a typical thing for Sasha to do. He is a fanatic. A completely impractical person,\" Pecanin said over the phone, getting quite worked up over the impressive degree of his friend's impracticality. \"He is predestined to be either a very successful writer, or a complete disaster. There was no chance of him being an average journalist somewhere.\" The chronically unworldly Hemon started keeping a diary written in his tourist's English, and set about expanding his literary vocabulary in the most direct way he could think of - by following in Nabokov's footsteps. \"I got myself a copy of Lolita, and I underlined every word I didn't understand, and then I would look them up,\" he said. \"At the beginning it took a very long time, because there were eight or ten underlined words on every page and I looked up the words in the Oxford English Dictionary for Advanced Learners, which has inscriptions and pictures, and some of the words in Lolita weren't in this dictionary.\" Hemon soon ventured far beyond Lolita, becoming possessed by what he calls the \"library demons\". \"I read everything all the time,\" he said, all the while obsessively hoarding his stock of words. He transcribed them on to hundreds of index cards, and if he could not immediately remember a word he had already looked up, he would punish himself with the laborious process of leafing through the weighty dictionary once more. The hoard became a \"mental warehouse\" of industrial proportions, jammed with a bookish vocabulary that went far beyond the requirements of his employment - which, at that time, consisted of going door to door raising funds for Greenpeace. He would drop words such as \"thwart\" and \"hirsute\" into his casual banter, and then wonder why his would-be contributors looked at him as if he were a salesman from Mars. He learnt his next lesson: \"Every word has its context. You have to learn the context.\" Memorising an entire language by rote was an arduous and often dispiriting process, and for a long while, Hemon found himself in the tongue-tied limbo of the hapless exile. \"I was between languages for three years. I couldn't write in Bosnian or in English. Whatever I said in English, I was lying, cheating. I was misrepresenting myself.\" Eventually, however, Hemon's obsessive dictionary-diving and stockpiling of index cards began to bring results in the deep linguistic recesses of his mind. \"I would catch myself using words that I didn't know I knew,\" he said. \"Not only did I begin to think in English, I dreamt in English, and I even remembered in English. I remembered things that happened in Sarajevo as if they happened in English.\" Hemon had given himself five years to write a publishable story in English, and he ended up achieving his goal in three. In 1995, he wrote an unusual contemplation about espionage, called The Sorge Spy Ring. It contained two narratives in one: on the top of the page was a part-autobiographical account of his own childhood suspicions that his father was a Soviet agent (fictionalised by a d\u00e9nouement in which the poor man is actually carted off to jail). Below, in the form of a series of historical footnotes, is the true story of Richard Sorge, a German diplomat in Japan who passed on Nazi secrets to Moscow, only to have his warnings of imminent invasion disregarded by Stalin. Together, the halves constitute a meditation on mixed and complex allegiances - a recurring motif in Hemon's work and life: as a Ukrainian-Serb hybrid in Bosnia when ethnic tensions were at their height eight years ago, and more recently as an immigrant trying to fit in while retaining a distinct identity. \"What attracted me was the multiple identity of Sorge,\" Hemon says. \"The idea of 'legend' - a spy's story of his imaginary life. My previous life was my 'legend'. I could say anything about my life, and no one would know it wasn't true. I didn't do it, because I was worried I would get out of control.\" Hemon submitted the Sorge story to Reginald Gibbons, writer and teacher at Chicago's Northwestern University who was also the editor of the US literary journal, TriQuarterly. The piece had rough edges, but in Gibbons' eyes it stood out as fresh and innovative. \"I liked him very much and I was also interested in his way of working,\" Gibbons said. \"We liked the same writers, such as Bruno Schulz and Danilo Kis. Both are outside the mainstream, and both are writers who wrote not in a straight-ahead way but who tried to capture the unrealistic nature of life. \"Sasha also used these modes outside realism - footnotes, mindgames, telescoping of time - devices that are an attempt to get a hold of a complex and absurd reality . . . I wish there were more American-born writers who would venture out of the realistic box. We seem to need infusions of Sashas.\" Gibbons also saw Hemon's natural advantage. By coming to the language from outside, he was all the more respectful of its quirks and its peculiar noises, like someone using a car for the first time. \"He's had a great ear for the way language is used, and he is very, very gifted,\" said Gibbons. \"It gives him a place to stand which English speakers don't have. Most writers are somewhat lazy and don't listen to what they write. He has a way of hearing English one word at a time.\" The remark chimed with something that Hemon said once over the phone. The way he put it was, \"In English, I have the linguistic sensibility of a child, and the mind of an adult.\" Hemon did not expect to be greeted like Nabokov's second coming, and has no aspirations to leave his Edgewater home in the Chicago suburbs, nor give up his weekend football games with Uptown United - a bunch of fellow immigrants from around the globe, who knock the ball about, yelling in mutually unintelligible versions of English. A diehard Liverpool FC supporter in a country that has never heard of Anfield or the Kop, Hemon says, \"It was only after I started playing football and writing that I realised I could in fact live in the United States\". But get him on the subject of the current state of English-language fiction and he sounds as arrogant and dismissive as any London literary lord. He does not mean to, and occasionally apologises for giving that impression, but he insists he is simply being straightforward. However, when he did learn to comprehend English, he found very little to excite him in contemporary writing. When he first hungrily picked up some modern US short stories, he found himself throwing the book across the room. \"There was such carelessness about language,\" he explained. \"It was sloppy. And there was that unfortunate tendency towards Hemingway-style minimalism. You remove all the adjectives. I don't believe in that. I believe in Nabokov's way. You pile them up until the object is formed completely.\" By now, Hemon was sitting at his favourite local Italian joint and audibly warming to the theme. His second beef was that he initially found very little US or British writing that is about anything. In the comfortable world of the west at the turn of the century, it seemed as though there was nothing to write about except middle-class ennui. \"There seemed to be a lack of ambition. There were stories about commuter marriages and mid-life crises. I thought maybe I don't understand this. Maybe it's the language, the culture, but I don't think so. If I'm a good writer, it's because I'm a good reader. I was reading and there was nothing there,\" he says. \"I don't expect them to write about war, but it was so unambitious, as if it was their hobby, as if they didn't need to write stories. I felt I needed to write stories and I couldn't.\" Now he can, and has, and is, for the time being, happy with what he's produced. \"I wrote this book the way I wanted it,\" he said at one point during an afternoon-long conversation in Chicago. Hemon believes he is a better writer now in English than he ever was in Bosnian, because of what he has experienced in between: the destruction of his country and life in exile. He checked himself, and pointed out that his problems as a refugee had never been comparable to those who endured Sarajevo's bloody siege, in which 10,000 are thought to have been killed. He is, after all, happily married to an American writer and journalist, and \"comfortable\" with his mixed identity. \"One thing I don't want to do,\" he declares with a sudden surge of feeling, \"is to claim I am the voice of Bosnian suffering.\" Yet everything Hemon writes is unmistakably flavoured by Bosnia in all its modern ages - from the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand through the long years of Tito's rule to a golden period of a few brief years between the extinction of communism and the explosion of rabid nationalism, when Sarajevo flowered as an exciting and magnetic cultural centre. The number of Hemon's contemporaries to have settled around the world as successful writers, artists and film-makers is phenomenal. To be creative as a generation, Hemon argued, \"you have to have a sense that the old order is not valid any more. I had a sense that the previous generations used it up, used their chance up.\" During his spell as cultural editor on Dani, he refused to allow anyone older than 27 to write for the magazine, despite the pleas of his friend and editor, Senad Pecanin. For Pecanin, too, those years - the late 80s, 1990 and 1991 - were a golden era. \"Sasha belongs to a good generation of poets, film-makers, and writers right before the war,\" he said. \"At the time, we couldn't imagine a war. Who could attack us, we thought. How stupid.\" Many of those who spent much of 1991 partying are still astonished at their own disregard for the menace looming over Bosnia. Hemon explains it this way: \"There is a psychological mechanism in human beings which doesn't allow them to imagine their own demise. But the imagination of evil people exceeds the imagination of good people.\" The sense of history lurking beneath the present is a key element of the central European experience. It is this history that has condemned the Hemon family to be perpetual outsiders since they arrived in Bosnia from Ukraine. For Sasha, in his story Exchange Of Pleasant Words, the family's rootlessness weighs like a punishment for some past transgression: \"Perhaps this is the punishment: we have to live these half-lives of people who cannot forget what they used to be and who are afraid of being addressed in a foreign language, no longer able to utter anything truly meaningful.\" It is, Hemon argues, immigrants and outsiders, with their blurred affiliations, who are positioned to write the best prose, because they are one step removed from both a society's language and its everyday reality. It is something he did not fully appreciate when he was Professor Koljevic's favourite student. But Koljevic, while helping to turn a million Bosnians into refugees, also gave Hemon a unique outsider's perspective, and taught him that history counts. \"Before, I didn't see any difference between history and fiction. It was a typical nihilist point of view,\" he said. \"What I later realised was that history came and bumped me on the head, but I should have paid attention all along.\" \u0095 The Question Of Bruno, by Aleksandar Hemon, is published by Picador on April 21 at \u00a312.99.

      "body": "<p>Lombardo could have kept quiet about what he had found out: by proving the poem was a forgery, he would be proving that his finest hour had been his greatest blunder. But, instead, he became even more determined to find out the truth. His doubts about the poem reached critical mass when he tracked down one of the key books about the Hofmann case, Victims, by Richard Turley. In an appendix to the book was a list. \"I read how investigators had found a piece of paper in Hofmann's cell,\" recalls Lombardo. \"On one side, he listed all the Mormon documents he had forged. On the other, he listed the literary and historical figures.\" Emily Dickinson was the sixth name on the list. \"It was the first really dark moment in all of this,\" Lombardo recalls. \"It entered my mind that, if this really was a forgery, I did not think I could be part of this town any more. I would not be able to face people knowing that I had caused all this.\" </p> <p>But this was no time for self-pity. If he was to convince Sotheby's that the poem was a forgery - and thereby ensure that the library's $21,000 be refunded - he would have to have a watertight case. Again, he turned to Franklin, who had first examined the poem from one perspective - for evidence that it was genuine. Now, at Lombardo's request, he began to study it for flaws. \"I kept looking and looking for something that would show a forger's hand,\" he says. \"And I finally came up with a few anomalies.\" One detail Franklin focused on was the capital \"E\" in \"Everyone\". Forgers often give themselves away by lifting the pen or pencil as they laboriously try to copy a sample of handwriting: and Franklin felt that it showed signs of hesitation. \"It has an awkwardness that is not typical of her,\" he explained. \"But who is to say that Emily couldn't have burped at that moment?\" </p> <p>By now, Lombardo and Franklin were conferring almost daily and, gradually, these two very different men - an anti-establishment liberal from Amherst and a patrician academic from Yale - were becoming firm friends. Franklin offered to call Sotheby's. As the director of the Beinecke, he is an important Sotheby's customer. \"I called David Redden, a man I have known for years,\" Franklin said. \"What I was trying to press him on was the provenance - whether the Gallery of History had consigned this document to Sotheby's.\" </p> <p>Redden, a member of Sotheby's board of directors and worldwide head of books, manuscripts and collectables, insisted that the poem had not come from the Gallery of History. Franklin was not convinced. If everything Lombardo had been told was true, then the manuscript had, in less than three years, gone from an estate in California to the Gallery of History, to a collector in the Midwest, to a dealer there who had died, and then to Sotheby's. \"Things just don't move that fast in the book trade,\" says Franklin. </p> <p>The next day, Lombardo called Marsha Malinowski again, to say that, given the suspicions surrounding the poem, Sotheby's now had a responsibility to prove its authenticity. There was, she replied, \"absolutely no question\" of the poem's authenticity. She insisted that several experts had studied the poem, among them, one of the world's leading experts on forgery: Kenneth Rendell, the man who exposed the fake Hitler Diaries, and who had also been the key specialist witness at Hofmann's trial. Selby Kiffer confirmed that 10 to 15 manuscript experts had seen the poem, adding that a woman named Jennifer Larson had been consulted about two questionable documents in the previous, May 1997 auction, but that she had not raised any concerns about the Dickinson manuscript. </p> <p>Larson is a respected rare books dealer and former chairperson of the Ethics Committee of the Antiquarian Booksellers' Association of America. Since the mid-80s, she has also been on a personal crusade, cataloguing Hofmann's non-Mormon forgeries in an attempt to prevent them from contaminating the trade she loves. She had indeed been asked by Sotheby's about two other possible Hofmann forgeries, but not about the Dickinson poem. If she had been, she would have faxed them the documentation she now forwarded to Lombardo. One was an illustration from a book by Todd Axelrod, owner of the Gallery of History, showing an \"unknown\" Dickinson poem, which Lombardo could see was the poem he had bought from Sotheby's. Another was a copy of a letter Hofmann had written to his lawyer from jail in October 1986. In it, he stated, \"The E Dickinson item referred to is a forgery.\" </p> <p>The final piece of the puzzle fell into place when Lombardo reached a man called Shannon Flynn at a gun-shop in Salt Lake City. Flynn had negotiated many of Hofmann's business deals, and acted as his courier. He is also a crack marksman and firearms expert. When Hofmann was arrested, the police found a cache of weapons at Flynn's apartment but, after 12 hours of questioning, he was cleared of all suspicion, and has since co-operated fully with police. He confirmed to Lombardo that, in 1985, on Hofmann's behalf, he had flown to Las Vegas with an Emily Dickinson poem that he had sold to Axelrod. </p> <p>Lombardo notified Sotheby's that in 48 hours he would be issuing a press release stating that the poem was a forgery, and that he would like the auction house's assurance in writing that the Jones Library would receive a full refund. Sotheby's immediately complied. \"There was no apology. No embarrassment,\" recalls Lombardo. \"As if this was just a little blip in its daily business. Just routine.\" </p> <p>It was a telling perception. Sotheby's and the other auction houses are allowed to operate under terms tolerated in no other branch of commercial life. The small print in their catalogues does include a guarantee of authenticity (albeit one limited to only five years ), but if anything proves to be \"wrong\", they can say, as they routinely do, that they are merely the agents for the sale and, therefore, not directly responsible. The onus is on you, the purchaser, to satisfy yourself that the article you buy is genuine. Caveat emptor. </p> <p>Although Sotheby's refunded the Jones Library's money, many questions remained. I knew, from Flynn, that the poem had come from Hofmann and been sold to Axelrod. I knew from Brent Ashworth that Axelrod had displayed it in his gallery. And I knew from Ralph Franklin that, in 1994, two-and-a-half years before it turned up at Sotheby's, Axelrod's archivist had contacted him to have it authenticated. But I did not know the crucial, middle part of the story: how the poem had got from the Gallery of History in Las Vegas to Sotheby's in Manhattan. And I never thought I would. But then occurred an event of such improbable coincidence that if I had seen it in a movie, I wouldn't have believed it. </p> <p>I had flown to Las Vegas to find out what I could about the Gallery of History. By chance, Flynn was going to be there at the same time, so we arranged to meet. A round-faced leprechaun of a man, he cracked jokes and called me buckaroo. I liked him immediately. At the same time, I felt a tinge of nervousness. \"Any guns back there, Shannon?\" I asked, pointing at the jumble of boxes in the back of his van, as we stopped at a traffic light on our way to find Axelrod. Flynn pulled a blue case from under the seat and opened it. Inside was a 9mm Glock and a clip of bullets. \"An armed society is a polite society,\" he said, with a grin, ramming the clip home. </p> <p>In the basement of the two-storey, concrete building in which the Gallery of History was housed was a restaurant with poker machines set into the bar top. Upstairs, I was approached by a salesman with grey skin and a toup\u00e9e. Did they have any autographs of famous poets? I enquired. Tennyson? Whitman? Perhaps an Emily Dickinson? </p> <p>The salesman went to consult the inventory. While he was gone, Axelrod walked out of an office at the back of the showroom. He was even bigger than his photos suggested: big, like a Sumo wrestler. A cinnamon-coloured poodle trotted at his heels. Moments later, two men walked into the showroom carrying a white, oblong package. One was a courier. The other, I guessed, was a driver. </p> <p>\"I have the Sotheby's package,\" I heard the courier say. Pretending I needed a smoke, I hurried downstairs to the front door. A few minutes later, the two men followed. </p> <p>\"I couldn't help hearing the word Sotheby's,\" I asked one of them nonchalantly. \"Anything exciting?\" </p> <p>\"Oh, just a few documents,\" the courier said. \"A Daniel Boone and some other stuff.\" </p> <p>Sotheby's, I knew, had withdrawn another Hofmann forgery, a Boone autograph, from the sale prior to the one at which the Dickinson poem was auctioned. Was that what was in the box? </p> <p>\"What's the name of your company?\" I asked. \"I often need a good art shipper.\" </p> <p>The courier pulled back his jacket front to reveal the logo on his shirt. It was a Brooklyn company. I asked for the telephone number. He held up the top of the invoice. </p> <p>\"Was that 9770 or 9970?\" I queried. </p> <p>The courier let the invoice fall open. The driver scowled, and tried to cover it with his hand. Then the two men left the building, crossed the parking lot and climbed into a silver-coloured stretch limo. Three items from the top of the invoice, I had seen the words \"Emily Dickinson poem\". </p> <p>Back in the showroom, I thought for a moment Axelrod would throw me out. When I told him that Flynn was outside, he swelled up like an angry bull-frog. </p> <p>When I returned the next day, he was more composed, and he was not alone. On a sofa sat his wife, Pamela; on her left was Axelrod's legal counsel, and next to me sat a PR consultant in cowboy boots. Axelrod countered almost all of my questions with amnesia. He could not recall what Flynn had told him about the poem's provenance. He could not recall whether the poem had been printed in his book. He could not recall whether it had been displayed in his store during the 80s. He was also careful to maintain a firewall between himself and any direct responsibility for the poem. It was always \"Tammy\" or \"our archivist\" who gave opinions or wrote reports. When I asked to speak to Tammy , Axelrod told me that she was, unfortunately, no longer with the company. What happened? </p> <p>\"She is dead,\" said Axelrod. He paused, looked at his wife, then continued uncertainly. \"She . . . ugh . . . she left our organisation. To join a hotel. And then I believe she fell down in the bathtub.\" </p> <p>\"In the bathroom,\" Pamela Axelrod corrected, staring into her lap. \"It was very sad.\" </p> <p>Axelrod did not want to share with me the contents of the Dickinson \"narrative\" - a short history of a document that the Gallery of History would have provided for Sotheby's. He used the same excuse that Gareth Williams had used to Lombardo six months earlier: that the computers were down. </p> <p>He did answer my most important question, however. How had the Dickinson poem got from the Gallery of History in Las Vegas to Sotheby's in Manhattan? It had, indeed, been consigned by a dead man, and he was the fifth corpse to have floated to the surface of this fetid pond. This dead man was real. His name was James E Halden, and he was a multi-millionaire from Glenbrook, Nevada. His wife, Ethelmae Stuart, is a jelly and jam heiress. With 49% of the shares, Halden was also the largest investor in the Gallery of History Inc. After his death in 1995, the trust established to administer his estate, the Ethelmae Stuart-James E Halden Trust, sensing that the wind had gone out of Axelrod's sails, decided to bail out of the company. As part of the liquidation of their investment, the trust received from Axelrod more than $2 million-worth of historical documents. </p> <p>I had always wondered why Sotheby's would take any risk at all for a 25% commission on a risible $21,000 (the sale price of the Dickinson manuscript), but on a consignment worth $2 million, the commission would be $500,000. The rare books and manuscripts department is the poor cousin within the Sotheby's family - the big money is in fine art and jewellery - and is under tremendous pressure to perform. And complete inventories are particularly sought-after because they involve less work and expense to sell than individual documents. </p> <p>Significantly, the catalogues for the May and June 1997 auctions made no mention of the trust. They dropped names such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Ryerson Library at the Art Institute of Chicago, and the Estate of William Randolph Hearst. \"The way the deal evolved,\" Axelrod explained, \"was that copies of the documents we had given to our client [the Stuart-Halden trust] were forwarded to Sotheby's. Sotheby's carried out an analysis of their estimated value. The client was then furnished with their estimates, and we negotiated our transaction.\"</p> <p>When it was time to close the deal in October 1996, Justin Caldwell (yet another Sotheby's vice-president in the rare books and manuscripts department) flew to Las Vegas to inspect and take possession of the consignment. Axelrod provided Caldwell with an office at the Gallery of History, where he checked each document against an inventory approved by his department. Axelrod could not recall the exact number of documents in the consignment - he estimated it at between 500 and 600 - but he did recall, with considerable pique, how suspiciously the Sotheby's representative had treated him.</p> <p>Sotheby's claim to be the unwitting victim of Hofmann's crime. In a three-page statement that Kiffer faxed me in February 1998, he said that he had taken Ashworth and Larson's warnings seriously and had subsequently read up on Hofmann in two books. What Kiffer discovered in these books, for apparently the first time, was \"Hofmann's incredible and continuing deceptiveness\". His account of the authentication of the Dickinson poem is that it was studied closely at Sotheby's exhibition by several prominent Dickinson scholars, and that none of them questioned its authenticity. Kiffer does not name these \"scholars\", but as Ralph Franklin is the only person Sotheby's mentioned to Lombardo, we can assume Kiffer means, among others, him. </p> <p>Franklin did travel down to New York to look at the poem four days before the auction. And while he was studying it, a Sotheby's employee engaged him in conversation. \"It was mostly small-talk,\" recalls Franklin, \"but I suppose that they could have interpreted from that conversation that I thought the poem was genuine.\" </p> <p>Kiffer's statement lists four \"inconsistencies in the handwriting and dating of the poem\" that Franklin is supposed to have detected. As a result of these inconsistencies, Kiffer implies, Sotheby's declared the poem a forgery. He asserts that Brent Ashworth had not told him that this poem was a forgery nor that it had been offered to him by Hofmann. He concludes: \"Perhaps Ashworth intended to warn me; but, to my mind, this was simply an interesting but tangential anecdote from someone who had many dealings with Hofmann.\"</p> <p>The question remains: why did Sotheby's proceed with the sale? The answer to that lies in the escalating competition between auction houses, both real and virtual, for the burgeoning market in collectables, today worth an estimated $30 billion annually. America, awash in money from the longest bull-run in history, has gone auction mad. Where there was once a handful of auction houses, there are now dozens. The biggest growth is on the internet. With the success of eBay, America's first and biggest on-line auction house, there has been a proliferation of virtual sale-rooms. Sotheby's has teamed up with Amazon.com to hold online auctions. In all, there are 150,000 online auction sites where, for as little as $1, punters can bid on anything from original artwork to a baseball signed by Babe Ruth. </p> <p>The sky-rocketing prices of collectables in general have driven up the price of historical documents and autographs. \"A George Washington letter that used to sell for $500 can now fetch $500,000,\" says Charles Sachs, owner of The Scriptorium, a well-established dealer in Beverly Hills, California. \"What has happened is that people have drifted in from the art world, where they were used to paying that kind of money.\" Billy Crystal is a collector, so is Barbra Streisand. \"Hollywood people have started to buy extensively for gifts,\" says Sachs. \"Lincoln letters for their lawyers, Freud for their psychiatrists.\"</p> <p>And with the demand for manuscripts have come the forgeries. \"I probably came across one forgery per week,\" recalls Roy Davids, the head of the Books and Manuscript Department at Sotheby's, in London, from 1970-1994. \"But we had very few things returned. In fact, I can remember only one case: a letter by the painter, Raphael. It's one's first duty: to make sure that something is right. And when I was at Sotheby's, it was a fairly rare occurrence that forgeries went undetected. My impression is that the system is not as water-tight as it used to be.\"</p> <p>\"Forgery is rife at the moment,\" says Ian Sayer, a leading British collector of second world war memorabilia, \"particularly in the sports and celebrity area. And the internet has only made the situation worse. I estimate that 60-70% of the stuff being traded on the internet is forged. It's becoming a plague.\"</p> <p>In parallel, as prices sky-rocket, buyers are becoming increasingly less concerned with whether something is genuine. \"There is an incredible desire on the part of people to believe that something they have purchased is real,\" says Jennifer Larson. Hofmann knew this. His forgeries told the stories that people wanted to hear. \"It mattered to us so much that we had found a new poem\", recalls Susan Juhasz, a Dickinson scholar from Colorado who contributed money to buy the poem. \"It was very heady. Very exciting.\" </p> <p>Lombardo makes no bones about how deeply Sotheby's sale of a forgery by a convicted double-murderer has affected him. At first, when the story of his sleuthing became known in Amherst, he was treated as a hero - a small New England community had shown Madison Avenue that they were no hicks. Within a year, disillusioned by his experiences with Sotheby's, he had given up his job.</p> <p>As for Mark Hofmann - little remains of the plump, rosy-cheeked bookseller who was once a Mormon missionary. He is lean and mean, his right arm atrophied as a result of a suicide attempt, his skin blotched and scarred from the bomb blast. His wife divorced him some years ago. Hofmann writes the chess pages for the prison newspaper. He has an IQ of 138, and is a member of Mensa. His only visitor is his ageing mother. He will almost certainly die in jail. His forgeries continue to plague the historical documents trade. Jennifer Larson estimates that there are 50-100 literary forgeries currently on the market, including writings by Mark Twain, Jack London, John Quincy Adams and George Washington.</p> <p>In a letter he wrote to Lombardo from jail, Hofmann gives an account of the genesis of the poem. \"I picked Dickinson because her autograph material is among the most valuable of American poets. And it was a challenge. My critique of Dickinson's poems is that a few of them are great, some are good, but many are inferior (some so much so I think she would have considered them drafts). My attempt was nowhere near her best, but is, I think, better than some. . . Just before composing the poem I attempted to read enough of her material until I felt in touch with her muse. I may have made three or four working drafts. The only thing I remember about the composition is whether I should use the words 'summer's grass' or 'winter's sun'. I thought the words 'Aunt Emily' added a touch of veracity.\" Hofmann had thought that when he was exposed as a forger in 1985, it became common knowledge that the poem was a forgery. </p> <p>When I called Axelrod to confirm that he still had the poem, he was by turns vague, and aggressive. \"I don't know if it was returned,\" he said. When I told him that I had seen it delivered from Sotheby's with my own eyes, he said: \"Well, I guess it's in our bogus files. When we find forgeries, we don't just throw them in the garbage.\"</p> <p>\u00a9 Simon Worrall, 2000</p>",

And then I believe she fell down in the bathtub.\" \"In the bathroom,\" Pamela Axelrod corrected, staring into her lap. \"It was very sad.\" Axelrod did not want to share with me the contents of the Dickinson \"narrative\" - a short history of a document that the Gallery of History would have provided for Sotheby's. He used the same excuse that Gareth Williams had used to Lombardo six months earlier: that the computers were down. He did answer my most important question, however. How had the Dickinson poem got from the Gallery of History in Las Vegas to Sotheby's in Manhattan? It had, indeed, been consigned by a dead man, and he was the fifth corpse to have floated to the surface of this fetid pond. This dead man was real. His name was James E Halden, and he was a multi-millionaire from Glenbrook, Nevada. His wife, Ethelmae Stuart, is a jelly and jam heiress. With 49% of the shares, Halden was also the largest investor in the Gallery of History Inc. After his death in 1995, the trust established to administer his estate, the Ethelmae Stuart-James E Halden Trust, sensing that the wind had gone out of Axelrod's sails, decided to bail out of the company. As part of the liquidation of their investment, the trust received from Axelrod more than $2 million-worth of historical documents. I had always wondered why Sotheby's would take any risk at all for a 25% commission on a risible $21,000 (the sale price of the Dickinson manuscript), but on a consignment worth $2 million, the commission would be $500,000. The rare books and manuscripts department is the poor cousin within the Sotheby's family - the big money is in fine art and jewellery - and is under tremendous pressure to perform. And complete inventories are particularly sought-after because they involve less work and expense to sell than individual documents. Significantly, the catalogues for the May and June 1997 auctions made no mention of the trust. They dropped names such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Ryerson Library at the Art Institute of Chicago, and the Estate of William Randolph Hearst. \"The way the deal evolved,\" Axelrod explained, \"was that copies of the documents we had given to our client [the Stuart-Halden trust] were forwarded to Sotheby's. Sotheby's carried out an analysis of their estimated value. The client was then furnished with their estimates, and we negotiated our transaction.\" When it was time to close the deal in October 1996, Justin Caldwell (yet another Sotheby's vice-president in the rare books and manuscripts department) flew to Las Vegas to inspect and take possession of the consignment. Axelrod provided Caldwell with an office at the Gallery of History, where he checked each document against an inventory approved by his department. Axelrod could not recall the exact number of documents in the consignment - he estimated it at between 500 and 600 - but he did recall, with considerable pique, how suspiciously the Sotheby's representative had treated him. Sotheby's claim to be the unwitting victim of Hofmann's crime. In a three-page statement that Kiffer faxed me in February 1998, he said that he had taken Ashworth and Larson's warnings seriously and had subsequently read up on Hofmann in two books. What Kiffer discovered in these books, for apparently the first time, was \"Hofmann's incredible and continuing deceptiveness\". His account of the authentication of the Dickinson poem is that it was studied closely at Sotheby's exhibition by several prominent Dickinson scholars, and that none of them questioned its authenticity. Kiffer does not name these \"scholars\", but as Ralph Franklin is the only person Sotheby's mentioned to Lombardo, we can assume Kiffer means, among others, him. Franklin did travel down to New York to look at the poem four days before the auction. And while he was studying it, a Sotheby's employee engaged him in conversation. \"It was mostly small-talk,\" recalls Franklin, \"but I suppose that they could have interpreted from that conversation that I thought the poem was genuine.\" Kiffer's statement lists four \"inconsistencies in the handwriting and dating of the poem\" that Franklin is supposed to have detected. As a result of these inconsistencies, Kiffer implies, Sotheby's declared the poem a forgery. He asserts that Brent Ashworth had not told him that this poem was a forgery nor that it had been offered to him by Hofmann. He concludes: \"Perhaps Ashworth intended to warn me; but, to my mind, this was simply an interesting but tangential anecdote from someone who had many dealings with Hofmann.\" The question remains: why did Sotheby's proceed with the sale? The answer to that lies in the escalating competition between auction houses, both real and virtual, for the burgeoning market in collectables, today worth an estimated $30 billion annually. America, awash in money from the longest bull-run in history, has gone auction mad. Where there was once a handful of auction houses, there are now dozens. The biggest growth is on the internet. With the success of eBay, America's first and biggest on-line auction house, there has been a proliferation of virtual sale-rooms. Sotheby's has teamed up with Amazon.com to hold online auctions. In all, there are 150,000 online auction sites where, for as little as $1, punters can bid on anything from original artwork to a baseball signed by Babe Ruth. The sky-rocketing prices of collectables in general have driven up the price of historical documents and autographs. \"A George Washington letter that used to sell for $500 can now fetch $500,000,\" says Charles Sachs, owner of The Scriptorium, a well-established dealer in Beverly Hills, California. \"What has happened is that people have drifted in from the art world, where they were used to paying that kind of money.\" Billy Crystal is a collector, so is Barbra Streisand. \"Hollywood people have started to buy extensively for gifts,\" says Sachs. \"Lincoln letters for their lawyers, Freud for their psychiatrists.\" And with the demand for manuscripts have come the forgeries. \"I probably came across one forgery per week,\" recalls Roy Davids, the head of the Books and Manuscript Department at Sotheby's, in London, from 1970-1994. \"But we had very few things returned. In fact, I can remember only one case: a letter by the painter, Raphael. It's one's first duty: to make sure that something is right. And when I was at Sotheby's, it was a fairly rare occurrence that forgeries went undetected. My impression is that the system is not as water-tight as it used to be.\" \"Forgery is rife at the moment,\" says Ian Sayer, a leading British collector of second world war memorabilia, \"particularly in the sports and celebrity area. And the internet has only made the situation worse. I estimate that 60-70% of the stuff being traded on the internet is forged. It's becoming a plague.\" In parallel, as prices sky-rocket, buyers are becoming increasingly less concerned with whether something is genuine. \"There is an incredible desire on the part of people to believe that something they have purchased is real,\" says Jennifer Larson. Hofmann knew this. His forgeries told the stories that people wanted to hear. \"It mattered to us so much that we had found a new poem\", recalls Susan Juhasz, a Dickinson scholar from Colorado who contributed money to buy the poem. \"It was very heady. Very exciting.\" Lombardo makes no bones about how deeply Sotheby's sale of a forgery by a convicted double-murderer has affected him. At first, when the story of his sleuthing became known in Amherst, he was treated as a hero - a small New England community had shown Madison Avenue that they were no hicks. Within a year, disillusioned by his experiences with Sotheby's, he had given up his job. As for Mark Hofmann - little remains of the plump, rosy-cheeked bookseller who was once a Mormon missionary. He is lean and mean, his right arm atrophied as a result of a suicide attempt, his skin blotched and scarred from the bomb blast. His wife divorced him some years ago. Hofmann writes the chess pages for the prison newspaper. He has an IQ of 138, and is a member of Mensa. His only visitor is his ageing mother. He will almost certainly die in jail. His forgeries continue to plague the historical documents trade. Jennifer Larson estimates that there are 50-100 literary forgeries currently on the market, including writings by Mark Twain, Jack London, John Quincy Adams and George Washington. In a letter he wrote to Lombardo from jail, Hofmann gives an account of the genesis of the poem. \"I picked Dickinson because her autograph material is among the most valuable of American poets. And it was a challenge. My critique of Dickinson's poems is that a few of them are great, some are good, but many are inferior (some so much so I think she would have considered them drafts). My attempt was nowhere near her best, but is, I think, better than some. . . Just before composing the poem I attempted to read enough of her material until I felt in touch with her muse. I may have made three or four working drafts. The only thing I remember about the composition is whether I should use the words 'summer's grass' or 'winter's sun'. I thought the words 'Aunt Emily' added a touch of veracity.\" Hofmann had thought that when he was exposed as a forger in 1985, it became common knowledge that the poem was a forgery. When I called Axelrod to confirm that he still had the poem, he was by turns vague, and aggressive. \"I don't know if it was returned,\" he said. When I told him that I had seen it delivered from Sotheby's with my own eyes, he said: \"Well, I guess it's in our bogus files. When we find forgeries, we don't just throw them in the garbage.\" \u00a9 Simon Worrall, 2000",

      "body": "<p>Prisons are forlorn places at the best of times. But the Utah state correctional facility is a particularly bleak and lonely place. Situated on a drab, windswept plain 20 miles south of Salt Lake City, in the shadow of the Oqhirra Mountains, its squat, 50s concrete buildings look like something from the Gulag. \"That's the maximum-security wing,\" said Shannon Flynn, pointing at a low, grey building below us. \"Hofmann was in there at the beginning. But he's in minimum-security now.\" We had driven across the desert from Las Vegas. In the distance, the setting sun was turning the mountains a bruised, purple-blue. \"He told me once that he ranks pretty high on the prison hierarchy,\" Flynn continued. \"Evidently, rapists and child molesters are on the very bottom of the list. But murder rates high.\" </p> <p>The man he was describing is no ordinary murderer. Poetry and literature were the accomplices in his crimes; parchment and ink the tools of his trade. His name is Mark Hofmann and, until he was incarcerated, he was America's greatest literary forger: a man who combined obsessive historical research, extraordinary craftsmanship and an unerring instinct for what his customers wanted. Two years ago, one of those forgeries, a masterfully-executed poem by the much-loved American poet Emily Dickinson, who died in 1886, turned up at Sotheby's, New York, where it was sold for $21,000 to the Jones Library, in Dickinson's home town, Amherst, Massachusetts. </p> <p>\"I thought: this is just extraordinary,\" says Daniel Lombardo, the former curator of special collections at the Jones Library, recalling the moment when he first saw the poem in Sotheby's catalogue for its June 1997 auction of fine books and manuscripts. \"A complete poem, not a fragment of a poem. In my recollection, it had been decades since a poem came up this way.\" </p> <p>In fact, it was the first new poem by Dickinson to be discovered since 1955, when Thomas H Johnson published his three-volume variorum edition, fixing the Dickinson canon at 1,775 poems. It was like finding a new sonnet by Shakespeare, or a drawing by Turner. It was a sensation. From Puritan New England, Dickinson reaches across the years - a feminist icon who sang from her soul in a jazzy, idiosyncratic voice that chimes with contemporary tastes. In the opinion of the celebrated critic Harold Bloom, she is, with Walt Whitman, America's greatest poet. </p> <p>The poem was written in pencil, on a piece of blue-lined paper, measuring 8in by 5in and was signed \"Emily\". On the top left corner was an embossed insignia, and, in red ink, at the top right corner of a blank page attached to the poem, someone had also written the words \"Aunt Emily\" in an unidentified hand. It read: </p> <p> That God cannot </p> <p>be understood </p> <p>Everyone agrees </p> <p>We do not know </p> <p>His motives nor </p> <p>Comprehend his </p> <p>Deeds - </p> <p>Then why should I </p> <p>Seek solace in </p> <p>What I cannot </p> <p>Know? </p> <p>Better to play </p> <p>In winter's sun </p> <p>Than to fear the </p> <p>Snow </p> <p> For the people of Amherst, acquiring the poem was a coup. Not only is Emily Dickinson this small university town's most famous daughter, she is, as the Wordsworths are to Grasmere, a minor industry. Cafes offer tins of gingerbread baked to her original recipe. Scholars fill the town's B&amp;Bs. Each year, thousands of Dickinson fans from as far away as Japan and Chile make the pilgrimage to the ivy-covered house on Main Street where this famously reclusive poet lived. </p> <p>As part of his preparations for an exhibition on the poem's history, Lombardo called Marsha Malinowski, an expert in the department of books and manuscripts in New York, one of the two Sotheby's employees who had handled the sale. The trade in historical documents and manuscripts is as secretive as a Masonic order. Many collectors - such as Bill Gates, who set a world record two years ago when he paid $35 million for a Leonardo da Vinci notebook - are extremely wealthy, and do not wish their identities, or their collecting interests, to be known. \"Dealers are not forthcoming about provenance, and the auction houses also don't want to disclose their sources,\" says Jennifer Larson, an expert on Hofmann's forgeries. \"It's like a private club.\" </p> <p>Lombardo knew this as well as anyone, but he hoped that, as the poem had been bought by a public institution, Malinowski might be willing to disclose something of the poem's history. He was particularly curious about who had signed the words \"Aunt Emily\". It was the sort of telling, human detail that can breathe the spark of life into faded parchment. Malinowski said that she would be happy to ask the consignor for permission to waive Sotheby's standard confidentiality agreement and reveal his or her identity. But, a week later, she called back to say that the consignor of the poem had unfortunately not agreed. All she could say was that the poem had come from a collector, who had bought it from a dealer in the Midwest. Who had died. </p> <p>A few days later, Lombardo received a phone call from a man named Brent Ashworth, in Provo, Utah. Ashworth is an attorney, businessman and prominent member of Mormon society. He has also been a lifelong collector of historical documents, and is a passionate fan of Emily Dickinson. What he had to say sent a shiver down Lombardo's spine. In the early 80s, said Ashworth, a historical documents dealer named Mark Hofmann had offered to sell him an unpublished Dickinson manuscript for $10,000. </p> <p>\"I usually went up [to Hofmann's house] on Wednesdays, on the way to the law-firm that does our stock transactions,\" recalls Ashworth. \"He usually had a little valise or a folder he pulled things out of . . . something juicy he wanted to offer me. And one of those days he pulled out this Emily Dickinson.\" Ashworth believed that this was the same poem that Lombardo had just bought in Manhattan. </p> <p>Mark Hofmann was born in Salt Lake City in 1951, the son of a devout Mormon family. As a child, he was bookish, introspective, overweight. His parents hoped that their son would devote his life to God. And, for a time, it seemed as though he would. Hofmann did a stint abroad as a missionary (in Leicester). He sang in the Tabernacle choir. But, unbeknown to his parents and the Mormon community, Hofmann had already begun to live a double life. Since the age of 14, he had been forging, and selling, rare Mormon coins. On his return from England, he enrolled at university in Salt Lake City to study biology and zoology. His mother's anguish over his father's polygamy had aready caused him to question the Mormon faith. Instead of a world view based on the Gospels, Hofmann adopted a grim, nihilistic brand of Darwinism. His favourite TV programmes were nature documentaries showing predatory animals stalking and killing their prey. A semester short of graduation, he dropped out of university to become a rare books dealer. And a full-time forger. </p> <p>Forging coins had taught him two lessons: that things have no intrinsic value, and that people will believe what they want to believe. The Church of the Latter Day Saints was the perfect victim. Since its beginnings, in 1863, it has been a religion in search of authentication. The hundreds of thousands of dollars-worth of documents that Hofmann sold to the church were faith-promoting documents of the highest order. They included the earliest known Mormon artefact - a letter from the mother of the church's founder, Joseph Smith - and the last: a letter written by Smith from jail just before he was murdered. </p> <p>Hofmann's real intention, however, was to destroy the faith he despised. Like a virus planted in a computer, he began to feed the Church of Latter Day Saints with documents that called into question some of the fundamental tenets of the faith. His most famous forgery came to be known as The White Salamander Letter. In it, Hofmann portrayed the Mormon church's prophet, Joseph Smith, as a money-grubbing gold prospector who dabbled in black magic. Instead of angelic inspiration, he invented a diabolic, talking lizard. The Mormon Church bought the document for $250,000, and locked it away so that no one would see it. </p> <p>By then, Hofmann had begun to produce a string of brilliantly-executed literary forgeries. They were nearly always of American icons, charismatic historical figures, who touched a deep chord in the national consciousness, such as Nathan Hale, the young patriot executed by the British in the War of Independence, Abraham Lincoln, Mark Twain, Daniel Boone. Hofmann's favourite stratagem was to exploit lacunae in the historical record, creating a document that was known to have existed but had disappeared. </p> <p>Hofmann was a brilliant forger, and a brilliant dissembler. He was a happily married family man who spent hundreds of thousands of dollars assembling one of his country's finest collections of rare children's books as a patrimony for his own four children. He was charming, personable and knowledgeable; ruthless, cynical and amoral. </p> <p>Hofmann's weakness was, ironically, his passion for (genuine) antiquarian books. The more money he made on forgeries, the more he blew on precious books: $6,300 for a first edition of The Lord Of The Rings, $1,500 for a first edition of The Tailor Of Gloucester signed by Beatrix Potter. Meanwhile he was travelling America, living high on the hog. </p> <p>By October 1985, he was more than a million dollars in debt. To keep his creditors at bay, he began to resort to ever more machiavellian ruses. He offered investors in Salt Lake City part-ownership of documents he was planning to forge, then pocketed the money. And when a Salt Lake City businessman named Steve Christensen grew suspicious of a series of Mormon documents he was about to buy, Hofmann, the forger, mutated into Hofmann, the psychopath. </p> <p>Christensen was found whimpering like a child in the corridor outside his office in downtown Salt Lake City. The pipe-bomb Hofmann had left for him in a brown-paper bag was as meticulously constructed as his forgeries. Around a length of galvanised pipe, Hofmann had packed hundreds of 1in steel masonry nails that were meant not just to kill but to mutilate. One of them went straight through Christensen's eye and into his brain. He died. </p> <p>Later that day, another bomb shook the Mormon capital. It was meant for a man called Gary Sheets. Sheets had no connection to the historical documents world, but he was involved with Christensen in a failing savings-and-loans scheme that had left several Utahans bankrupt. The bomb was Hofmann's most elaborate and diabolical ruse so far: a decoy intended to make the police think that the two murders were revenge killings by disgruntled investors. But instead of killing Sheets, the bomb killed his wife. </p> <p>A few hours later, a third bomb exploded in the back of Hofmann's sports car, which was parked not far from the Mormon Tabernacle. Hofmann was found bleeding on the sidewalk. There was gaping hole in one knee and a gash in his head. Scattered about the street were shreds of both forged and genuine historical documents. Among them was a piece of Egyptian papyrus. In 1986, Hofmann was jailed for life for the two murders. </p> <p>Salt Lake City police believe that the third bomb was meant for Brent Ashworth. From 1981 to 1985, Ashworth had bought nearly $500,000-worth of documents from Hofmann and traded a further $300,000-worth of his own collection of genuine documents for forgeries. \"As I've been burned by a forger,\" he told me, \"I feel like: if the auction houses themselves don't stand up against these forgers, then the field itself is not going to be worth two cents to us collectors that invest a lot of time and money.\" When he saw the Dickinson poem in the Sotheby's June 1997 catalogue, Ashworth called Selby Kiffer, the other Sotheby's executive who had handled the sale and a man with whom Ashworth had had extensive dealings as a collector. \"One of the things I told him [Kiffer] was that I realise that there's no tests for pencil . . . but this thing Hofmann showed me . . . it's a fake,\" recalls Ashworth. \"That's what I told him.\" </p> <p>Kiffer's nickname at Sotheby's is Special Agent Kiffer, because he has always been so zealous in reporting stolen books to the FBI, but he did not appear particularly interested in Ashworth's story. \"He said that doesn't mean that it was necessarily a fake,\" says Ashworth. Kiffer also insisted that he'd had the poem checked out. When Ashworth asked by whom, Kiffer mentioned a Yale University professor, Ralph Franklin. </p> <p>Ironically, Ashworth's information had only further convinced Daniel Lombardo that the Dickinson manuscript was \"right\". Surely, he reasoned, if Ashworth had told Kiffer about the possible Hofmann connection, Sotheby's must have redoubled its efforts to authenticate the poem. But he had to be sure. So he contacted Franklin, the director of Yale's prestigious Beinecke Library and the world's leading expert on Dickinson's \"fascicles\" -the improvised books she made by copying her poems on to folded pieces of paper and binding them together. </p> <p>Using a linen-tester - a small, pocket magnifying glass used by textile merchants to evaluate cloth - Franklin studied the poem seraph by seraph. He measured the paper. He studied the boss-mark. Everything looked right. Dickinson had, for instance, used the kind of paper on which the poem was written - Congress paper, which was manufactured in Boston - only twice in her life. One of those times was 1871, the year the poem had supposedly been composed. The size of the paper was exactly right. Even the folds in the paper conformed to the way Dickinson had folded her poems before placing them in an envelope. But what convinced Franklin more than anything else was the handwriting - Dickinson's handwriting was an organic, living thing that changed radically in the course of her lifetime. In 1871, her handwriting was, literally, coming apart. \"Eventually, she would print nearly every letter,\" explained Franklin as we sat in his office at the Beinecke Library. \"At this point, Dickinson's ligatures of vowels and following consonants are fracturing. Things like '-an' or '-em' or '-en'. And what you have here are both versions. You have the word 'cannot' with '-an' linked. And you have 'cannot' with the '-an' open.\" His speech quickened. \"Look at this final 'd'!\" he said, pointing to the word \"comprehend\". \"There's a flip at the top of it. She does not make these neatly the same every time. It might lie down a little more, or be more erect. But it's just like her. That's Dickinson's 'd'!\" </p> <p>The biographical evidence was also compelling. In the early 1870s, Dickinson was in her 40s and, though her most prolific period was over, she was still writing about four poems a month. Some of these were just such playful pieces of impromptu verse as this one. \"The fact that the poem was ascribed to 'Aunt Emily',\" explains Lombardo, \"suggested that it had been written for a child - most likely for Ned Dickinson, the poet's nephew, who lived next door to her. In 1871, he would have been 10.\" Since 1864, Dickinson had also begun to use pencil more often. \"Ralph and I both agreed that, if this was a forgery, it would be mind-boggling,\" recalls Lombardo. </p> <p>But Hofmann was no ordinary forger. To create his most ambitious literary forgery, The Oath Of A Freeman - an oath of allegiance that was sworn by the first Americans to the Massachusetts Bay Colony, and which had been known about since it was recorded in the Bay Psalm Book of 1640 but which had never been found - Hofmann created a zinc printing plate, and spent days grinding down some of the letters to make the typeface look authentically uneven. He concocted ink from a 17th-century recipe, using linseed oil, beeswax and tannic acid obtained by boiling a leather book binding from the same period. The ink passed a Carbon-14 dating test. And the Library of Congress, having carried out exhaustive tests of its own, nearly bought the document for $1.5 million. </p> <p>Was That God Cannot Be Understood another of his masterpieces? The thought that he might have bought a forgery by a double-murderer shook Lombardo to the core. \"I could never have imagined that when I started work here as a librarian I could possibly get involved in something like this,\" he says. \"It is just too unbelievable.\" </p> <p>Ralph Franklin, he discovered, had first come across the poem in 1994, when he received a fax from a woman in Las Vegas named Tammy Kahrs, who was the archivist at a historical-documents company, the Gallery of History. Kahrs enclosed a copy of the poem, and provided information about the paper and the dating - she told Franklin, for instance, that the previous owners had dated the poem to 1871 or 1872. She also posed her own questions. Was the poem unpublished? To whom might it have been sent? Franklin confirmed that it was unpublished, and suggested that it could have been sent to Dickinson's nephew, Ned. In the course of one of their conversations, Kahrs also asked Franklin if the Gallery of History could use his name when they offered the manuscript for sale. Franklin, who never does authentications, rejected the request out of hand. </p> <p>The Gallery of History is owned by Todd Axelrod, the son of a wealthy publisher who, even before he graduated from NYU, had made more than $150,000 by buying and selling property. The real-estate business went sour on him, but by the early 80s he made himself a multi-millionaire trading in securities in New York. He then moved to Las Vegas and began to turn his longtime passion for collecting historical documents into a business empire. </p> <p>Collecting historical documents used to be the hobby of a few dedicated individuals. There were a few high-profile collectors, such as Malcolm Forbes and Armand Hammer, who steadily amassed collections worth hundreds of millions of dollars. But, generally, it was a low-key, economically insignificant business. But with the spiralling market for collectables of all kinds, the trade in rare manuscripts and autographs has gone through the roof, and is today worth an estimated $100 million per year. \"What price can you put on history?\" Forbes once quipped. </p> <p>By the mid-80s, Axelrod had assembled one of the US's largest private collections of historical documents and autographs: 100,000 items preserved, as he liked to boast, to \"Library of Congress standards\". Starting with a store in a ritzy shopping mall in Las Vegas, he had opened a chain of boutique-style outlets across the country. His target customer was a new kind of collector: people who did not want to keep their collection tucked away in safety-deposit boxes, as old-style collectors had. They wanted to see their money hanging on the wall. So, out of historic documents, Axelrod fashioned sexy \"works of art\". Each autograph was lavishly framed with an elegant portrait of the historic figure encased in the frame, and a grandiose plaque underneath. Ashworth claims to have seen the Dickinson poem displayed in just this way at the Georgetown DC branch of the Gallery of History in the late 80s, with a price tag of between $30,000 and $40,000. </p> <p>Lombardo reached the Gallery of History by phone, at the end of July 1997. He spoke to Gareth Williams, a senior vice-president. At first, Williams was friendly and helpful. He told Lombardo that he was familiar with the Dickinson poem, and that the gallery had acquired it some time before 1994. But when Lombardo asked if he would mind checking who had bought it, Williams grew testy and told him that the computers were down. When Lombardo pressed him on the origin of the poem, Williams said that he couldn't recall exactly, but thought that it had come from California, as part of the estate of a collector. Who had died. </p> <p>This was now the second corpse Lombardo had stumbled upon. Marsha Malinowski of Sotheby's had told him that the poem had originally come from a dead dealer in the Midwest. Now, he was being told it came from a dead man in California. What was the truth?</p> <p>\u00a9 Simon Worrall, 2000</p>",

Situated on a drab, windswept plain 20 miles south of Salt Lake City, in the shadow of the Oqhirra Mountains, its squat, 50s concrete buildings look like something from the Gulag. \"That's the maximum-security wing,\" said Shannon Flynn, pointing at a low, grey building below us. \"Hofmann was in there at the beginning. But he's in minimum-security now.\" We had driven across the desert from Las Vegas. In the distance, the setting sun was turning the mountains a bruised, purple-blue. \"He told me once that he ranks pretty high on the prison hierarchy,\" Flynn continued. \"Evidently, rapists and child molesters are on the very bottom of the list. But murder rates high.\" The man he was describing is no ordinary murderer. Poetry and literature were the accomplices in his crimes; parchment and ink the tools of his trade. His name is Mark Hofmann and, until he was incarcerated, he was America's greatest literary forger: a man who combined obsessive historical research, extraordinary craftsmanship and an unerring instinct for what his customers wanted. Two years ago, one of those forgeries, a masterfully-executed poem by the much-loved American poet Emily Dickinson, who died in 1886, turned up at Sotheby's, New York, where it was sold for $21,000 to the Jones Library, in Dickinson's home town, Amherst, Massachusetts. \"I thought: this is just extraordinary,\" says Daniel Lombardo, the former curator of special collections at the Jones Library, recalling the moment when he first saw the poem in Sotheby's catalogue for its June 1997 auction of fine books and manuscripts. \"A complete poem, not a fragment of a poem. In my recollection, it had been decades since a poem came up this way.\" In fact, it was the first new poem by Dickinson to be discovered since 1955, when Thomas H Johnson published his three-volume variorum edition, fixing the Dickinson canon at 1,775 poems. It was like finding a new sonnet by Shakespeare, or a drawing by Turner. It was a sensation. From Puritan New England, Dickinson reaches across the years - a feminist icon who sang from her soul in a jazzy, idiosyncratic voice that chimes with contemporary tastes. In the opinion of the celebrated critic Harold Bloom, she is, with Walt Whitman, America's greatest poet. The poem was written in pencil, on a piece of blue-lined paper, measuring 8in by 5in and was signed \"Emily\". On the top left corner was an embossed insignia, and, in red ink, at the top right corner of a blank page attached to the poem, someone had also written the words \"Aunt Emily\" in an unidentified hand. It read: That God cannot be understood Everyone agrees We do not know His motives nor Comprehend his Deeds - Then why should I Seek solace in What I cannot Know? Better to play In winter's sun Than to fear the Snow For the people of Amherst, acquiring the poem was a coup. Not only is Emily Dickinson this small university town's most famous daughter, she is, as the Wordsworths are to Grasmere, a minor industry. Cafes offer tins of gingerbread baked to her original recipe. Scholars fill the town's B&amp;Bs. Each year, thousands of Dickinson fans from as far away as Japan and Chile make the pilgrimage to the ivy-covered house on Main Street where this famously reclusive poet lived. As part of his preparations for an exhibition on the poem's history, Lombardo called Marsha Malinowski, an expert in the department of books and manuscripts in New York, one of the two Sotheby's employees who had handled the sale. The trade in historical documents and manuscripts is as secretive as a Masonic order. Many collectors - such as Bill Gates, who set a world record two years ago when he paid $35 million for a Leonardo da Vinci notebook - are extremely wealthy, and do not wish their identities, or their collecting interests, to be known. \"Dealers are not forthcoming about provenance, and the auction houses also don't want to disclose their sources,\" says Jennifer Larson, an expert on Hofmann's forgeries. \"It's like a private club.\" Lombardo knew this as well as anyone, but he hoped that, as the poem had been bought by a public institution, Malinowski might be willing to disclose something of the poem's history. He was particularly curious about who had signed the words \"Aunt Emily\". It was the sort of telling, human detail that can breathe the spark of life into faded parchment. Malinowski said that she would be happy to ask the consignor for permission to waive Sotheby's standard confidentiality agreement and reveal his or her identity. But, a week later, she called back to say that the consignor of the poem had unfortunately not agreed. All she could say was that the poem had come from a collector, who had bought it from a dealer in the Midwest. Who had died. A few days later, Lombardo received a phone call from a man named Brent Ashworth, in Provo, Utah. Ashworth is an attorney, businessman and prominent member of Mormon society. He has also been a lifelong collector of historical documents, and is a passionate fan of Emily Dickinson. What he had to say sent a shiver down Lombardo's spine. In the early 80s, said Ashworth, a historical documents dealer named Mark Hofmann had offered to sell him an unpublished Dickinson manuscript for $10,000. \"I usually went up [to Hofmann's house] on Wednesdays, on the way to the law-firm that does our stock transactions,\" recalls Ashworth. \"He usually had a little valise or a folder he pulled things out of . . . something juicy he wanted to offer me. And one of those days he pulled out this Emily Dickinson.\" Ashworth believed that this was the same poem that Lombardo had just bought in Manhattan. Mark Hofmann was born in Salt Lake City in 1951, the son of a devout Mormon family. As a child, he was bookish, introspective, overweight. His parents hoped that their son would devote his life to God. And, for a time, it seemed as though he would. Hofmann did a stint abroad as a missionary (in Leicester). He sang in the Tabernacle choir. But, unbeknown to his parents and the Mormon community, Hofmann had already begun to live a double life. Since the age of 14, he had been forging, and selling, rare Mormon coins. On his return from England, he enrolled at university in Salt Lake City to study biology and zoology. His mother's anguish over his father's polygamy had aready caused him to question the Mormon faith. Instead of a world view based on the Gospels, Hofmann adopted a grim, nihilistic brand of Darwinism. His favourite TV programmes were nature documentaries showing predatory animals stalking and killing their prey. A semester short of graduation, he dropped out of university to become a rare books dealer. And a full-time forger. Forging coins had taught him two lessons: that things have no intrinsic value, and that people will believe what they want to believe. The Church of the Latter Day Saints was the perfect victim. Since its beginnings, in 1863, it has been a religion in search of authentication. The hundreds of thousands of dollars-worth of documents that Hofmann sold to the church were faith-promoting documents of the highest order. They included the earliest known Mormon artefact - a letter from the mother of the church's founder, Joseph Smith - and the last: a letter written by Smith from jail just before he was murdered. Hofmann's real intention, however, was to destroy the faith he despised. Like a virus planted in a computer, he began to feed the Church of Latter Day Saints with documents that called into question some of the fundamental tenets of the faith. His most famous forgery came to be known as The White Salamander Letter. In it, Hofmann portrayed the Mormon church's prophet, Joseph Smith, as a money-grubbing gold prospector who dabbled in black magic. Instead of angelic inspiration, he invented a diabolic, talking lizard. The Mormon Church bought the document for $250,000, and locked it away so that no one would see it. By then, Hofmann had begun to produce a string of brilliantly-executed literary forgeries. They were nearly always of American icons, charismatic historical figures, who touched a deep chord in the national consciousness, such as Nathan Hale, the young patriot executed by the British in the War of Independence, Abraham Lincoln, Mark Twain, Daniel Boone. Hofmann's favourite stratagem was to exploit lacunae in the historical record, creating a document that was known to have existed but had disappeared. Hofmann was a brilliant forger, and a brilliant dissembler. He was a happily married family man who spent hundreds of thousands of dollars assembling one of his country's finest collections of rare children's books as a patrimony for his own four children. He was charming, personable and knowledgeable; ruthless, cynical and amoral. Hofmann's weakness was, ironically, his passion for (genuine) antiquarian books. The more money he made on forgeries, the more he blew on precious books: $6,300 for a first edition of The Lord Of The Rings, $1,500 for a first edition of The Tailor Of Gloucester signed by Beatrix Potter. Meanwhile he was travelling America, living high on the hog. By October 1985, he was more than a million dollars in debt. To keep his creditors at bay, he began to resort to ever more machiavellian ruses. He offered investors in Salt Lake City part-ownership of documents he was planning to forge, then pocketed the money. And when a Salt Lake City businessman named Steve Christensen grew suspicious of a series of Mormon documents he was about to buy, Hofmann, the forger, mutated into Hofmann, the psychopath. Christensen was found whimpering like a child in the corridor outside his office in downtown Salt Lake City. The pipe-bomb Hofmann had left for him in a brown-paper bag was as meticulously constructed as his forgeries. Around a length of galvanised pipe, Hofmann had packed hundreds of 1in steel masonry nails that were meant not just to kill but to mutilate. One of them went straight through Christensen's eye and into his brain. He died. Later that day, another bomb shook the Mormon capital. It was meant for a man called Gary Sheets. Sheets had no connection to the historical documents world, but he was involved with Christensen in a failing savings-and-loans scheme that had left several Utahans bankrupt. The bomb was Hofmann's most elaborate and diabolical ruse so far: a decoy intended to make the police think that the two murders were revenge killings by disgruntled investors. But instead of killing Sheets, the bomb killed his wife. A few hours later, a third bomb exploded in the back of Hofmann's sports car, which was parked not far from the Mormon Tabernacle. Hofmann was found bleeding on the sidewalk. There was gaping hole in one knee and a gash in his head. Scattered about the street were shreds of both forged and genuine historical documents. Among them was a piece of Egyptian papyrus. In 1986, Hofmann was jailed for life for the two murders. Salt Lake City police believe that the third bomb was meant for Brent Ashworth. From 1981 to 1985, Ashworth had bought nearly $500,000-worth of documents from Hofmann and traded a further $300,000-worth of his own collection of genuine documents for forgeries. \"As I've been burned by a forger,\" he told me, \"I feel like: if the auction houses themselves don't stand up against these forgers, then the field itself is not going to be worth two cents to us collectors that invest a lot of time and money.\" When he saw the Dickinson poem in the Sotheby's June 1997 catalogue, Ashworth called Selby Kiffer, the other Sotheby's executive who had handled the sale and a man with whom Ashworth had had extensive dealings as a collector. \"One of the things I told him [Kiffer] was that I realise that there's no tests for pencil . . . but this thing Hofmann showed me . . . it's a fake,\" recalls Ashworth. \"That's what I told him.\" Kiffer's nickname at Sotheby's is Special Agent Kiffer, because he has always been so zealous in reporting stolen books to the FBI, but he did not appear particularly interested in Ashworth's story. \"He said that doesn't mean that it was necessarily a fake,\" says Ashworth. Kiffer also insisted that he'd had the poem checked out. When Ashworth asked by whom, Kiffer mentioned a Yale University professor, Ralph Franklin. Ironically, Ashworth's information had only further convinced Daniel Lombardo that the Dickinson manuscript was \"right\". Surely, he reasoned, if Ashworth had told Kiffer about the possible Hofmann connection, Sotheby's must have redoubled its efforts to authenticate the poem. But he had to be sure. So he contacted Franklin, the director of Yale's prestigious Beinecke Library and the world's leading expert on Dickinson's \"fascicles\" -the improvised books she made by copying her poems on to folded pieces of paper and binding them together. Using a linen-tester - a small, pocket magnifying glass used by textile merchants to evaluate cloth - Franklin studied the poem seraph by seraph. He measured the paper. He studied the boss-mark. Everything looked right. Dickinson had, for instance, used the kind of paper on which the poem was written - Congress paper, which was manufactured in Boston - only twice in her life. One of those times was 1871, the year the poem had supposedly been composed. The size of the paper was exactly right. Even the folds in the paper conformed to the way Dickinson had folded her poems before placing them in an envelope. But what convinced Franklin more than anything else was the handwriting - Dickinson's handwriting was an organic, living thing that changed radically in the course of her lifetime. In 1871, her handwriting was, literally, coming apart. \"Eventually, she would print nearly every letter,\" explained Franklin as we sat in his office at the Beinecke Library. \"At this point, Dickinson's ligatures of vowels and following consonants are fracturing. Things like '-an' or '-em' or '-en'. And what you have here are both versions. You have the word 'cannot' with '-an' linked. And you have 'cannot' with the '-an' open.\" His speech quickened. \"Look at this final 'd'!\" he said, pointing to the word \"comprehend\". \"There's a flip at the top of it. She does not make these neatly the same every time. It might lie down a little more, or be more erect. But it's just like her. That's Dickinson's 'd'!\" The biographical evidence was also compelling. In the early 1870s, Dickinson was in her 40s and, though her most prolific period was over, she was still writing about four poems a month. Some of these were just such playful pieces of impromptu verse as this one. \"The fact that the poem was ascribed to 'Aunt Emily',\" explains Lombardo, \"suggested that it had been written for a child - most likely for Ned Dickinson, the poet's nephew, who lived next door to her. In 1871, he would have been 10.\" Since 1864, Dickinson had also begun to use pencil more often. \"Ralph and I both agreed that, if this was a forgery, it would be mind-boggling,\" recalls Lombardo. But Hofmann was no ordinary forger. To create his most ambitious literary forgery, The Oath Of A Freeman - an oath of allegiance that was sworn by the first Americans to the Massachusetts Bay Colony, and which had been known about since it was recorded in the Bay Psalm Book of 1640 but which had never been found - Hofmann created a zinc printing plate, and spent days grinding down some of the letters to make the typeface look authentically uneven. He concocted ink from a 17th-century recipe, using linseed oil, beeswax and tannic acid obtained by boiling a leather book binding from the same period. The ink passed a Carbon-14 dating test. And the Library of Congress, having carried out exhaustive tests of its own, nearly bought the document for $1.5 million. Was That God Cannot Be Understood another of his masterpieces? The thought that he might have bought a forgery by a double-murderer shook Lombardo to the core. \"I could never have imagined that when I started work here as a librarian I could possibly get involved in something like this,\" he says. \"It is just too unbelievable.\" Ralph Franklin, he discovered, had first come across the poem in 1994, when he received a fax from a woman in Las Vegas named Tammy Kahrs, who was the archivist at a historical-documents company, the Gallery of History. Kahrs enclosed a copy of the poem, and provided information about the paper and the dating - she told Franklin, for instance, that the previous owners had dated the poem to 1871 or 1872. She also posed her own questions. Was the poem unpublished? To whom might it have been sent? Franklin confirmed that it was unpublished, and suggested that it could have been sent to Dickinson's nephew, Ned. In the course of one of their conversations, Kahrs also asked Franklin if the Gallery of History could use his name when they offered the manuscript for sale. Franklin, who never does authentications, rejected the request out of hand. The Gallery of History is owned by Todd Axelrod, the son of a wealthy publisher who, even before he graduated from NYU, had made more than $150,000 by buying and selling property. The real-estate business went sour on him, but by the early 80s he made himself a multi-millionaire trading in securities in New York. He then moved to Las Vegas and began to turn his longtime passion for collecting historical documents into a business empire. Collecting historical documents used to be the hobby of a few dedicated individuals. There were a few high-profile collectors, such as Malcolm Forbes and Armand Hammer, who steadily amassed collections worth hundreds of millions of dollars. But, generally, it was a low-key, economically insignificant business. But with the spiralling market for collectables of all kinds, the trade in rare manuscripts and autographs has gone through the roof, and is today worth an estimated $100 million per year. \"What price can you put on history?\" Forbes once quipped. By the mid-80s, Axelrod had assembled one of the US's largest private collections of historical documents and autographs: 100,000 items preserved, as he liked to boast, to \"Library of Congress standards\". Starting with a store in a ritzy shopping mall in Las Vegas, he had opened a chain of boutique-style outlets across the country. His target customer was a new kind of collector: people who did not want to keep their collection tucked away in safety-deposit boxes, as old-style collectors had. They wanted to see their money hanging on the wall. So, out of historic documents, Axelrod fashioned sexy \"works of art\". Each autograph was lavishly framed with an elegant portrait of the historic figure encased in the frame, and a grandiose plaque underneath. Ashworth claims to have seen the Dickinson poem displayed in just this way at the Georgetown DC branch of the Gallery of History in the late 80s, with a price tag of between $30,000 and $40,000. Lombardo reached the Gallery of History by phone, at the end of July 1997. He spoke to Gareth Williams, a senior vice-president. At first, Williams was friendly and helpful. He told Lombardo that he was familiar with the Dickinson poem, and that the gallery had acquired it some time before 1994. But when Lombardo asked if he would mind checking who had bought it, Williams grew testy and told him that the computers were down. When Lombardo pressed him on the origin of the poem, Williams said that he couldn't recall exactly, but thought that it had come from California, as part of the estate of a collector. Who had died. This was now the second corpse Lombardo had stumbled upon. Marsha Malinowski of Sotheby's had told him that the poem had originally come from a dead dealer in the Midwest. Now, he was being told it came from a dead man in California. What was the truth? \u00a9 Simon Worrall, 2000",

      "body": "<p>Past houses called Bali Hai, Belmore and Shangri-La lies Edward Upward's home. You expect a sign saying Mortmere, breaking the line of happy havens by alluding to its owner's shocking short stories, which he suppressed for decades. But there's just a number. Everything on the Isle of Wight is miniaturised to suit the old and the very old. Upward, 96 and still writing, has become part of the process: dwarfed in a big winged armchair, in his bit of offshore Britain where his family has its roots.</p> <p>Edward Upward is a bit of an oddity: a Repton and Cambridge chum of Isherwood, and co-creator with him of the surreal, salacious world of Mortmere. Isherwood always stressed how working with Upward developed the element of fantasy in his own fiction. </p> <p>Then there's Upward's 30 years as a public school teacher - during which time he had an extra-mural career as a Marxist activist. And his break with the Communist party of Great Britain in 1948 because, he felt, it was diluting its ideals. There's also a self-imposed literary silence of almost 20 years, mainly for political reasons. When he started writing again in 1961, the surreal, nightmare style which had won acclaim was replaced by a spare, bare prose which baffled some critics. </p> <p>Odd, too, are the vicissitudes of Upward's reputation. Journey to the Border, his first novel, came from the Hogarth Press in 1938. \"The madness in it appealed to Virginia [Woolf],\" he says. Subsequently he was taken up, then dropped, by Heinemann and Penguin. Finally, he was rediscovered in the 90s by a small press, Enitharmon. </p> <p>Through all this, the drive to write survived. Without any apology, many characters in his new short story collection are old active lefties. The title story, The Coming Day, is about Cedric, who absconds from a residential home and crosses the familiar Upward divide from reality to fantasy. His picaresque journey takes him to such places as an abattoir hung with human corpses; a football riot; and a private school run by a paedophile, all of which episodes elicit didactic reflections. </p> <p>Cedric is a retired, widowed teacher. The one solace in his wanderings is the young woman he meets who happens to be a gerontophile. Upward shows that the saving grace of sex extends even to wrinklies. There's a gay gerontophile in another story, though the poor chap gets kicked out of bed by the greyhead he attempts to snuggle up to. </p> <p>But don't look for any autobiographical links in any of this fictional sex. When bawdy Auden and his mates went to a gay brothel in Berlin before the last war, the happily heterosexual Upward remained outside. Even now, the long-married but widowed author is shy about any personal revelation. He admits only that, even at his age, \"life without female company would be unbearable\". </p> <p>It would be unbearable without politics, too. His characters still carry their beliefs in their rucksacks, for Upward remains an unswerving Marxist. This gives them a shining, simple view of the mess we've made of the world. At the same time, certainly in the later collections of stories, it doesn't make them naive or crankish: they are presented as interesting, experienced old folk. </p> <p>From his straight-jacket prose, you might imagine that Upward is a humourless ideologue.

      "bodyText": "Past houses called Bali Hai, Belmore and Shangri-La lies Edward Upward's home. You expect a sign saying Mortmere, breaking the line of happy havens by alluding to its owner's shocking short stories, which he suppressed for decades. But there's just a number. Everything on the Isle of Wight is miniaturised to suit the old and the very old. Upward, 96 and still writing, has become part of the process: dwarfed in a big winged armchair, in his bit of offshore Britain where his family has its roots. Edward Upward is a bit of an oddity: a Repton and Cambridge chum of Isherwood, and co-creator with him of the surreal, salacious world of Mortmere. Isherwood always stressed how working with Upward developed the element of fantasy in his own fiction. Then there's Upward's 30 years as a public school teacher - during which time he had an extra-mural career as a Marxist activist. And his break with the Communist party of Great Britain in 1948 because, he felt, it was diluting its ideals. There's also a self-imposed literary silence of almost 20 years, mainly for political reasons. When he started writing again in 1961, the surreal, nightmare style which had won acclaim was replaced by a spare, bare prose which baffled some critics. Odd, too, are the vicissitudes of Upward's reputation. Journey to the Border, his first novel, came from the Hogarth Press in 1938. \"The madness in it appealed to Virginia [Woolf],\" he says. Subsequently he was taken up, then dropped, by Heinemann and Penguin. Finally, he was rediscovered in the 90s by a small press, Enitharmon. Through all this, the drive to write survived. Without any apology, many characters in his new short story collection are old active lefties. The title story, The Coming Day, is about Cedric, who absconds from a residential home and crosses the familiar Upward divide from reality to fantasy. His picaresque journey takes him to such places as an abattoir hung with human corpses; a football riot; and a private school run by a paedophile, all of which episodes elicit didactic reflections. Cedric is a retired, widowed teacher. The one solace in his wanderings is the young woman he meets who happens to be a gerontophile. Upward shows that the saving grace of sex extends even to wrinklies. There's a gay gerontophile in another story, though the poor chap gets kicked out of bed by the greyhead he attempts to snuggle up to. But don't look for any autobiographical links in any of this fictional sex. When bawdy Auden and his mates went to a gay brothel in Berlin before the last war, the happily heterosexual Upward remained outside. Even now, the long-married but widowed author is shy about any personal revelation. He admits only that, even at his age, \"life without female company would be unbearable\". It would be unbearable without politics, too. His characters still carry their beliefs in their rucksacks, for Upward remains an unswerving Marxist. This gives them a shining, simple view of the mess we've made of the world. At the same time, certainly in the later collections of stories, it doesn't make them naive or crankish: they are presented as interesting, experienced old folk. From his straight-jacket prose, you might imagine that Upward is a humourless ideologue. In fact, he's quite the opposite. In conversation he's jolly, even japish: it's easy to picture him chuckling with Isherwood over Mortmere and its cast of snobby grotesques. Long ago he destroyed the manuscripts of almost all the 20s fantasies. However, Isherwood's pieces - none of which had seen the light of day - and a very few by Upward (including The Railway Accident, acclaimed, but long out of print) were published by Enitharmon as The Mortmere Stories in 1994. Even 70 years after they were conceived, they can shock. Isherwood has a gothick tale about an aristocratic hunchback with an appetite for faeces. Upward's railway tale about sabotage on the line, with soldiers among the gory dead, was even more horrific in its uncut version. One scene described the rape by three choristers of a fellow schoolboy. \"I could easily have gone on writing as I had in the unexpurgated Railway Accident. I would have sold hundreds of thousands.\" But he consciously chose to cut off a vein, comic and Kafkaesque, that was uniquely his. Was it wise for a writer to change track so abruptly?

Brunson's voice, so reassuring on News at Ten, soon starts to sound bland when it is stretched beyond bulletin length.Those short spurts on the telly ruin the rhythm necessary for longer speech.",

Chasing Men has chapter headings like \"Sod the Curtains\" and characters who say things like \"I do like country house hotels, don't you?

Probably around 13 and a half stone.\" On the staircase outside her flat she finds a suicidal fat girl. \"She loomed over Hetty; she must be five feet 10 and over 15 stone.\" As for Hetty, she is a size 14 going on 16, until she loses weight and discovers that 20lbs is the difference between sex with a banana and sex with Norman, a man so perfect \"she could detect not an ounce of spare fat on him\". </p> <p>In the strange parallel universe inhabited by Currie, where Jaffa Cakes, Drambuie and Ritz crackers are singled out for product placement and biscuits are still proudly served on doilies, the name Norman has no less erotic a cadence than Nabokov's Lolita. \"Norman\", Hetty whispers \"Norman...\" And when Hetty whispers, Currie makes everything from the trees to the \"mousse dispenser\" in her bathroom talk back. \"Don't be dazzled\" says a champagne glass. \"Face the outside world with confidence\" says a wardrobe. Alas, the only inanimate object for which one actually feels some sympathy remains mute, \"bruised and blackened, under the bed\".

As it opens, Laura Blundy stoves her husband's head in with an ornament she has always hated and the crutch she has used since her leg was amputated, and listens curiously as nonsense words spew out of his mouth \"all cock-a-snip\". Soon, \"a bloody black hole\" takes the place of his mouth, and he falls silent. As Laura attempts to finish him off, hearing \"the bone that held his nose in place crunch like sugar\", a ham skids - \"pinkly glossy in the half-light\" - across the pantry floor. </p> <p>In another writer, this determination to document the physical reality of the world might tip over into gratuitous phrase-making. One can imagine someone straining for the right words to describe, say, a poker skewering a brain; here we are simply alerted to a \"definite juicy crunch, like going into raw potato. Another sigh, a rushy liquid sound.\" </p> <p>Throughout Laura Blundy, Myerson takes apart our notions of Victorian melodrama and mawkishness. Her heroine has lived the perfect Dickensian life: thrown out onto the street after a \"mischievous will\", raped in the back of a cab by a fine gentleman and landed with a baby at 15, familiar with foundling hospital, workhouse and prison alike. Yet Laura, and those around her, are also immediately recognisable.</p> <p>Myerson refuses to lard her dialogue with cod-Victoriana (\"I can't save you from your frigging mother\", Laura remonstrates with her future husband), or to allow the staples of a reconstructed London - the grimy river, families sleeping five to a room, cabs whose iron wheels crush a woman's bones like eggshells - to obscure the urgency and intimacy of her story. </p> <p>That story is told with an exceptionally subtle understanding of the macabre and the desperate. Laura is a woman to whom shocking incidents have occurred with nightmarish frequency, her destitution leading her into an underworld where death meshes with the everyday business of living.</p> <p>The most vividly recreated of these acts of brutality becomes the pivot of the novel when, mown down by a cab, she is taken to hospital and has her leg sawn off at the knee. The surgeon who operates on her, beguiled by her mixture of stoicism and frantic neediness, caresses her hip as he shows off his handiwork to onlookers and keeps her quiet with tots of brandy. Later he marries her, and begins the wretched process of trying to convert her into his ladylike consort. Later still, she murders him, cuts his body into small pieces and tries to burn his head over a makeshift fire. </p> <p>If Laura has power, it lies in her ability to simultaneously attract and repel men. In turn, she herself both needs and despises them. One of the grisliest scenes in the book - pokers and bonfires notwithstanding - comes as she gives her new husband an account of her rape. She, for once, is attempting to put aside the manipulation and hard-as-nails banter that characterise her dealings with men; he finds the story the most immense turn-on and promptly re-enacts the assault. </p> <p>No wonder, then, that she turns to Billy, 15 years her junior but already locked into poverty-stricken marriage and fatherhood, when her husband's body lies oozing blood in their richly decorated, eerily silent house. Billy and Laura's relationship, reprised in flashbacks that alternate with an almost comic description of their body-disposal ordeal, is brilliantly realised as a tense see-saw between passion and terror, the promise of love eclipsed by the far more probable doom-laden outcome. But the most convincing portrait in the novel is of Laura alone, struggling to subdue and contain her desires as life metes out punishment after punishment. \"I have lost all manner of things,\" she remarks as she grieves over her lost leg. \"A person can only take so much loss.\" </p> <p>One of the things Laura has lost is her baby, and with that her sense of her life as one with the potential for happiness or stability. Veering between almost infantile dependency and hard-hearted recklessness, she is heart-breakingly unpredictable and savagely out of control. This is not a predicament that is confined to a particular period or situation, and Myerson makes the extremity of her circumstances almost irrelevant to the empathy we feel for her. </p> <p>It is likely that this will be one of the strangest, most compelling novels this year. It's not for the squeamish; but if you'd like to see a writer really trying to do something different, then take your courage in your hands.</p>",

Later still, she murders him, cuts his body into small pieces and tries to burn his head over a makeshift fire. If Laura has power, it lies in her ability to simultaneously attract and repel men. In turn, she herself both needs and despises them. One of the grisliest scenes in the book - pokers and bonfires notwithstanding - comes as she gives her new husband an account of her rape. She, for once, is attempting to put aside the manipulation and hard-as-nails banter that characterise her dealings with men; he finds the story the most immense turn-on and promptly re-enacts the assault. No wonder, then, that she turns to Billy, 15 years her junior but already locked into poverty-stricken marriage and fatherhood, when her husband's body lies oozing blood in their richly decorated, eerily silent house. Billy and Laura's relationship, reprised in flashbacks that alternate with an almost comic description of their body-disposal ordeal, is brilliantly realised as a tense see-saw between passion and terror, the promise of love eclipsed by the far more probable doom-laden outcome. But the most convincing portrait in the novel is of Laura alone, struggling to subdue and contain her desires as life metes out punishment after punishment. \"I have lost all manner of things,\" she remarks as she grieves over her lost leg. \"A person can only take so much loss.\" One of the things Laura has lost is her baby, and with that her sense of her life as one with the potential for happiness or stability. Veering between almost infantile dependency and hard-hearted recklessness, she is heart-breakingly unpredictable and savagely out of control. This is not a predicament that is confined to a particular period or situation, and Myerson makes the extremity of her circumstances almost irrelevant to the empathy we feel for her. It is likely that this will be one of the strangest, most compelling novels this year. It's not for the squeamish; but if you'd like to see a writer really trying to do something different, then take your courage in your hands.",

The action sinks beneath the weight of peripheral information, even if the sporadically muscular prose does its best to engage us.

Scott Fitzgerald. As a young man, when the writing life stretched before him like an ocean of discovery and he was experiencing the first flush of early success, Fitzgerald remained oppressed by feelings of inauthenticity. He felt powerfully that something important was missing from his life, and spoke repeatedly of the \"hauntedness\" of The Great Gatsby.</p> <p>It is not difficult to understand what he meant: a sense of lost time and the irretrievability of the past gave much of his work - indeed, his life - an ineradicable undertone of mourning. \"All the stories that came into my head had a touch of disaster in them,\" he reflected in the autobiographical essay \"Early Success\", written in 1937 when he had already entered the long twilight of his short career. </p> <p>More than a decade earlier, high on the thin air of his own celebrity after the triumphant publication of his debut, This Side of Paradise, Fitzgerald was travelling along Broadway in an open-top car. It was a warm, still night, and he was in a heightened state of drunken exhilaration. The future seemed infinitely inviting. Then, bafflingly, he began to cry - because \"life would never be so sweet again\".</p> <p>This story, found in Andre Le Vot's superb F. Scott Fitzgerald (Penguin, 1984), is archetypal Fitzgerald behaviour, at once poignant and self-savouringly sentimental. A similar sense of fragility was present in the distinctive moments of his best work - in Gatsby's doomed quest to recapture the past, in Dick Diver's retreat from the world in Tender is the Night, in the failed romance of the story \"Winter Dreams\". Fitzgerald, like his revered Keats, was a compulsive nostalgic, locating happiness in the search for sensation rather than in its realisation; in the dream of desire, not in its fulfilment.</p> <p>Paradise was published when Fitzgerald was 24, amiably recasting the wasted promise of his Princeton years as a frivolous romance elevated by flights of transcendence. Within five years came the slight The Beautiful and the Damned, about the excesses of the idle rich he'd met there; and then, improbably, in 1925, The Great Gatsby, perhaps the most perfect short novel in the English language. It is on this - along with Tender is the Night, the unfinished The Last Tycoon and some of the more accomplished stories - that his reputation rests. </p> <p>From there, it seemed Fitzgerald had nowhere else to go. Once past 30, his descent into alcoholism was swift. His subsequent struggles make for a familiar story; indeed, an overfamiliar one. Scott Donaldson, who has been writing about Fitzgerald and Hemingway for more than 40 years, diligently chronicles this narrative of decline all over again: the intense, difficult relationship Fitzgerald had with his unstable wife, Zelda; the ambivalent self-positioning; the aimless wandering in Europe; the last wretched years as a hack writer in Hollywood before his fatal heart attack in 1940. </p> <p>In one sense, Fitzgerald willed himself into decline. His father was a failed businessman from Maryland, and as a child Scott was encouraged to nurture a wistful romanticism about the American South, with its faded elegance, genteel old families and confederate honour. He nurtured, too, a cult of doomed youth, whereby to be young and beautiful (and certainly rich) was to be most fully alive, and to be old was nothing.</p> <p>As Hemingway once told him: \"You put so much damned value on youth it seemed to me that you confused growing up with growing old.\" Above all, the young Fitzgerald nurtured the idea of falling in love - preferably painfully, which he did soon enough when, before leaving for Princeton, he met a girl called Ginerva King, who would become the model for all those rich, lovely, careless women in his stories and novels. </p> <p>Yet out of this essentially jejune adolescent sensibility Fitzgerald constructed a poetics of romantic despair, the expression of what it means to seek individual fulfilment in a time of nihilism. He conveyed, as the critic HL Mencken put it, something of the \"inexplicable tragedy of being alive\". </p> <p>You won't find Mencken's remark in Hemingway Vs. Fitzgerald. In fact, you will find very little of interest at all if you have read any previous Fitzgerald biographies. Like Jeffrey Meyers, another American much drawn to Fitzgerald and Hemingway, Donaldson operates as a kind of high-class literary gossip, scattering speculations about penis size and chatter about money like cheap confetti. He seems unwilling or unable to separate the life from the work, so that every fictional event finds its locus in actuality.</p> <p>Like Meyers, he also writes with grim mechanical efficiency. Practical criticism and close reading are kept to a perfunctory minimum, and language is hurried into clich\u00e9 - Hemingway, we are told, \"cuts a romantic figure\", critics \"sing his praises\" and, worst of all, his son is \"built like a brick shithouse\". </p> <p>The best feature of the book is Donaldson's engagement with American literary celebrity. He understands how the great writer's life is a monument of striving, paranoia and anguished rivalry; how competition between writers can be endless. Both Fitzgerald and Hemingway urgently craved early success, as if, like someone with a congenital heart condition, they knew that time was short. Both produced their best work before they were 30.</p> <p>At first, they were extremely supportive of each other - Fitzgerald in particular, recommending his younger friend to his editor, Maxwell Perkins at Scribner's, and offering valuable critiques of what became The Sun Also Rises (1926). Slowly, their friendship was corrupted by competition. Fitzgerald knew that Hemingway was the more innovative writer; that his anti-style, stripped of all excessive ornamentation, was something new in American letters (although the hard journalistic prose of Stephen Crane was a precursor). But above all, Fitzgerald envied Hemingway's vigorous worldliness, his swagger and adventurism. </p> <p>As Fitzgerald sickened, becoming less productive and more detached from reality as he entered his 30s, so Hemingway flourished, even as his own fiction became formulaic and tired. And as he flourished, he came to loathe his former mentor. In private he referred to Fitzgerald as \"poor old Scott\", mocking his clumsy drinking and reliance on Zelda. After Fitzgerald's death, he wrote: \"What a lovely writer he was within his ignorance and lack of education, and his adoration of the rich. He should have been a spaniel.\" </p> <p>What is unpleasant about this remark - apart from its obvious viciousness - is the way Hemingway seizes on the widespread idea that Fitzgerald was no more than a literary barbarian, an uneducated fool who by a fluke wrote a great novel. Edmund Wilson, an old friend from Princeton, was fond of saying that \"F. Scott Fitzgerald mispronounces more words than any educated person [I] know\". (Privately, the same Wilson, having re-read Gatsby, could also write enviously of how \"much better Fitzgerald's prose and dramatic sense were than mine\".) </p> <p>The real hero of Donaldson's study, though, is neither of the rivalrous writers, but Maxwell Perkins, who never ceased encouraging and believing in Fitzgerald, especially during the nine unhappy years he took to complete Tender. A selection of the correspondence between them is published as an appendix to Trimalchio, an early version of Gatsby submitted to Scribner's during the summer of 1924. It reminds us how important Perkins was in smoothing it into the form we know today, encouraging Fitzgerald to rework several chapters and even questioning the position of certain commas. </p> <p>Fitzgerald, who died aged 44, never matched the achievements of his early precocity. His last years, spent stumbling around Hollywood, were particularly wretched. His only consolation was the memory of his talent: he had always known he was good. \"I feel I have an enormous power in me now,\" he told Perkins while revising Gatsby. We still feel that power today, 75 years after the first publication of a novel that is the verbal equivalent of perfect pitch.</p>",

      "trailText": "<p>Mark Hollingsworth  on Stephen Dorril's revealing history of MI6</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong> MI6: Fifty Years of Special Operations</strong> <br>Stephen Dorril <br>Fourth Estate, \u00a325, 907pp<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501231421,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>At the heart of this exceptionally well researched book is the notion that MI6 has operated as the covert interventionist instrument of British foreign policy. In forensic detail Stephen Dorril shows how, since 1945, our secret service has engaged in what he politely calls \"disruptive actions\": attempted assassinations (Egypt, Libya), coup d'\u00e9tats (Albania, Iran, Oman), forging Swiss bank account documents (East Germany) and psychological warfare (planting of false information, secret funding of propaganda and smearing opponents). </p> <p>Many MI6 officers believed in the 50s and 60s that they were the true arbiters of the national interest. As former deputy chief George Young stated: \"It is the spy who has been called upon to remedy the situation created by deficiencies of ministers, diplomats, generals and priests.\" So, for the past 50 years, argues Dorril, MI6 has operated as a state within a state, influencing and manipulating foreign policy to suit its jaundiced view of the world. </p> <p>Like most western leaders, MI6 believed that nationalism in the Middle East and Africa would inevitably lead to communism. That baseless but popular preconception, alongside a desire to protect US/UK oil interests, coloured their operations, and Dorril catalogues just how far the service was prepared to go to ensure that a government was to its liking. A recurring theme is MI6's dependence on the CIA, whose financial fire-power often gave it the edge, notably in funding European anti-communist networks and technical intelligence-gathering. </p> <p>But their joint covert actions were not always successful. The 1949 attempt to overthrow the communist regime in Albania ended in abject failure. \"It is a gruesome story,\" wrote defence specialist John Keegan, \"made all the more so by the perception, apparently denied to the masterminds of subversion, that the Albanian communists were far more adept at deciding the future of their country than a bunch of romantic meddlers with a public-school education and a free supply of plastic explosives.\" </p> <p>A more effective operation was the MI6-controlled coup in Iran, which removed the popular and moderate prime minister, Mohammed Mossadeq, despised by the British because he nationalised the Iranian oil industry. MI6 and the CIA armed, funded and directed the conspirators, and Mossadeq was ousted in 1953. </p> <p>A crucial component of what MI6 calls \"special political action\" is the use of psychological warfare. According to Dorril, MI6 planted false stories, secretly subsidised news agencies and radio stations, manipulated opinion polls and smeared opponents by leaking forged documents. Known as \"black propaganda\", this was a combination of covert news management and sinister dirty tricks. </p> <p>What emerges from Dorril's exhaustive research is that MI6 has been a law unto itself. A group of senior operatives were obsessed with Britain's decline as a world power, and would resort to any illegal operation to reverse it; they appeared to think foreign policy should be founded on the maxim \"God is an Englishman\" (as stated by ex-operative Julian Amery). Former MI6 controllers admit that the period 1948-1958 was a horrific dark age, but they claim that the service was cleaned up by Harold Macmillan and has been under ministerial control ever since. Any controversial \"black arts\" operation needs full Foreign Office sanction. Is this credible? </p> <p>Dorril provides evidence to the contrary. He cites MI6's involve ment in the 1970 coup in Oman and, to a lesser extent, in Yemen, and relates how, in 1965, MI6 conspired with the CIA to \"liquidate\" Indonesia's president Sukarno.

      "bodyText": "MI6: Fifty Years of Special Operations Stephen Dorril Fourth Estate, \u00a325, 907pp Buy it at BOL At the heart of this exceptionally well researched book is the notion that MI6 has operated as the covert interventionist instrument of British foreign policy. In forensic detail Stephen Dorril shows how, since 1945, our secret service has engaged in what he politely calls \"disruptive actions\": attempted assassinations (Egypt, Libya), coup d'\u00e9tats (Albania, Iran, Oman), forging Swiss bank account documents (East Germany) and psychological warfare (planting of false information, secret funding of propaganda and smearing opponents). Many MI6 officers believed in the 50s and 60s that they were the true arbiters of the national interest. As former deputy chief George Young stated: \"It is the spy who has been called upon to remedy the situation created by deficiencies of ministers, diplomats, generals and priests.\" So, for the past 50 years, argues Dorril, MI6 has operated as a state within a state, influencing and manipulating foreign policy to suit its jaundiced view of the world. Like most western leaders, MI6 believed that nationalism in the Middle East and Africa would inevitably lead to communism. That baseless but popular preconception, alongside a desire to protect US/UK oil interests, coloured their operations, and Dorril catalogues just how far the service was prepared to go to ensure that a government was to its liking. A recurring theme is MI6's dependence on the CIA, whose financial fire-power often gave it the edge, notably in funding European anti-communist networks and technical intelligence-gathering. But their joint covert actions were not always successful. The 1949 attempt to overthrow the communist regime in Albania ended in abject failure. \"It is a gruesome story,\" wrote defence specialist John Keegan, \"made all the more so by the perception, apparently denied to the masterminds of subversion, that the Albanian communists were far more adept at deciding the future of their country than a bunch of romantic meddlers with a public-school education and a free supply of plastic explosives.\" A more effective operation was the MI6-controlled coup in Iran, which removed the popular and moderate prime minister, Mohammed Mossadeq, despised by the British because he nationalised the Iranian oil industry. MI6 and the CIA armed, funded and directed the conspirators, and Mossadeq was ousted in 1953. A crucial component of what MI6 calls \"special political action\" is the use of psychological warfare. According to Dorril, MI6 planted false stories, secretly subsidised news agencies and radio stations, manipulated opinion polls and smeared opponents by leaking forged documents. Known as \"black propaganda\", this was a combination of covert news management and sinister dirty tricks. What emerges from Dorril's exhaustive research is that MI6 has been a law unto itself. A group of senior operatives were obsessed with Britain's decline as a world power, and would resort to any illegal operation to reverse it; they appeared to think foreign policy should be founded on the maxim \"God is an Englishman\" (as stated by ex-operative Julian Amery). Former MI6 controllers admit that the period 1948-1958 was a horrific dark age, but they claim that the service was cleaned up by Harold Macmillan and has been under ministerial control ever since. Any controversial \"black arts\" operation needs full Foreign Office sanction. Is this credible? Dorril provides evidence to the contrary. He cites MI6's involve ment in the 1970 coup in Oman and, to a lesser extent, in Yemen, and relates how, in 1965, MI6 conspired with the CIA to \"liquidate\" Indonesia's president Sukarno. Margaret Thatcher showed no reluctance in sharing the burden of policing the world; Dorril claims that, in 1980, Thatcher \"authorised MI6 to undertake 'disruptive actions' \" during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. More recently, former MI6 officer Richard Tomlinson described how, in 1992, he saw an internal document that described a plan to assassinate President Milosevic. Three years later, according to former MI5 officer David Shayler, MI6 plotted to murder Colonel Gaddafi by funding and running Libyan agents who opposed the regime. As more evidence emerges to support Shayler's allegation, it appears that MI6 has not quite relinquished its self-appointed role as an international enforcer of British foreign policy. If it is to be effective in its new role - investigating the proliferation of nuclear and chemical weapons, tracking drug smugglers and countering money-laundering - MI6 will need to lift the veil of secrecy behind which it has hidden for too long. The lesson of this book is that, unless there is more transparency and accountability, a revival of unofficial bomb-and-blast foreign policy cannot be ruled out. Dorril, co-author of books on the Profumo scandal and MI5's plot against Harold Wilson, has read an enormous amount. He has interviewed some former MI6 officers who have not spoken before; however, the book relies largely on published sources and there are some gaps. For example, there is not enough on MI6's organisation, its internal structure and how special operations were authorised. It also suffers from inadequate editing, and Dorril has a tendency to bombard the reader with a bewildering array of facts and names. Given its ambitious scope, though, this is a remarkable achievement and an encyclopedic post-war history which any student of the secret world should read. \u0095 Mark Hollingsworth is the author, with Nick Fielding, of Defending the Realm: MI5 and the Shayler Affair (Andre Deutsch).",

He replaces the outgoing ambassador, Chris Lamb, who left on February 15. A time and date for formal presentation of Mr Stewart's credentials is to be discussed with the Yugoslavian foreign ministry, a spokesman for the embassy said.</p> <p>Canberra's decision has provoked anger in western capitals, where a policy of sanctions and diplomatic isolation are viewed as crucial in the attempt to make Serbia a pariah state and hasten the downfall of the Milosevic regime.</p> <p>Madeleine Albright, the US secretary of state, is understood to have phoned Canberra to urge the administration to drop the idea.</p> <p>The Foreign Office in London was reluctant to voice any concerns. A spokesman said: \"Australian diplomatic representation is a matter for them. We are aware of it. It is not causing us any worry.\"</p> <p>The only UN embargo in force against what remains of Yugoslavia - made up of Serbia and Montenegro - is a ban on arms sales. An EU ban on commercial flights was suspended in February; EU sanctions against oil sales and financial investments go on.</p> <p>There is speculation in the Yugoslav capital that the improvement in relations with Canberra has its origins in missions that visited Belgrade to seek the release of three Australian workers from the aid organisation Care, who were arrested at the beginning of the Kosovo conflict and jailed on espionage charges.</p> <p>Long meetings were held between leading figures in Australia's large Serbian expatriate community, government representatives and officials from Care, to win the men's release. Malcolm Fraser, a former Australian prime minister who is chairman of Care Australia, went to Belgrade several times to meet Mr Milosevic to lobby for the men's release; they were freed late last year.</p> <p>Defending its present move, Canberra's department of foreign affairs and trade said the ambassador was needed to serve the large number of Australian citizens and dual nationals living in and visiting Yugoslavia; it did not signify support for the regime.</p> <p>Mr Fraser insisted that no deal had been struck to secure the aid workers' surprise release: \"There were no bar gains.\" Asked about other nations' refusal to renew diplomatic relations with Belgrade, he replied: \"I could think of nothing worse for Australia than to be bound by European Union or Nato policy. We're an independent country, we need to make our own decisions.\"</p> <p>EU and Nato states have so far avoided creating the spectacle of a western ambassador paying homage to Mr Milosevic, fearing it would boost his credibility. Mr Stewart's presentation of his credentials to the president is bound to be on Yugoslav TV and the press.</p> <p>Other governments have avoided this by not rotating ambassadors or by bringing in a lower level of representative.</p> <p>The US has no diplomatic post in Belgrade; the British, French and Germans have so-called interest sections hosted by other countries and confined to cultural, consular and commercial activities.</p> <p>Italy is very keen to have a full ambassador to handle the substantial issues between Belgrade and Rome. It wants a deal where a new ambassador does not have to present him or herself to Mr Milosevic.</p> <p>Under the Vienna convention, a new ambassador is only an ambassador-designate until his \"letter of credence\" is accepted by the head of state. So Mr Stewart will be Australia's new ambassador only when Mr Milosevic accepts him.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Australia has broken ranks with the west by sending a new ambassador to Yugoslavia and instructing him to hand his credentials to the head of state - President Slobodan Milosevic, who is charged with war crimes. Charles Stewart, Canberra's new man, arrived in Belgrade on Tuesday. He replaces the outgoing ambassador, Chris Lamb, who left on February 15. A time and date for formal presentation of Mr Stewart's credentials is to be discussed with the Yugoslavian foreign ministry, a spokesman for the embassy said. Canberra's decision has provoked anger in western capitals, where a policy of sanctions and diplomatic isolation are viewed as crucial in the attempt to make Serbia a pariah state and hasten the downfall of the Milosevic regime. Madeleine Albright, the US secretary of state, is understood to have phoned Canberra to urge the administration to drop the idea. The Foreign Office in London was reluctant to voice any concerns. A spokesman said: \"Australian diplomatic representation is a matter for them. We are aware of it. It is not causing us any worry.\" The only UN embargo in force against what remains of Yugoslavia - made up of Serbia and Montenegro - is a ban on arms sales. An EU ban on commercial flights was suspended in February; EU sanctions against oil sales and financial investments go on. There is speculation in the Yugoslav capital that the improvement in relations with Canberra has its origins in missions that visited Belgrade to seek the release of three Australian workers from the aid organisation Care, who were arrested at the beginning of the Kosovo conflict and jailed on espionage charges. Long meetings were held between leading figures in Australia's large Serbian expatriate community, government representatives and officials from Care, to win the men's release. Malcolm Fraser, a former Australian prime minister who is chairman of Care Australia, went to Belgrade several times to meet Mr Milosevic to lobby for the men's release; they were freed late last year. Defending its present move, Canberra's department of foreign affairs and trade said the ambassador was needed to serve the large number of Australian citizens and dual nationals living in and visiting Yugoslavia; it did not signify support for the regime. Mr Fraser insisted that no deal had been struck to secure the aid workers' surprise release: \"There were no bar gains.\" Asked about other nations' refusal to renew diplomatic relations with Belgrade, he replied: \"I could think of nothing worse for Australia than to be bound by European Union or Nato policy. We're an independent country, we need to make our own decisions.\" EU and Nato states have so far avoided creating the spectacle of a western ambassador paying homage to Mr Milosevic, fearing it would boost his credibility. Mr Stewart's presentation of his credentials to the president is bound to be on Yugoslav TV and the press. Other governments have avoided this by not rotating ambassadors or by bringing in a lower level of representative. The US has no diplomatic post in Belgrade; the British, French and Germans have so-called interest sections hosted by other countries and confined to cultural, consular and commercial activities. Italy is very keen to have a full ambassador to handle the substantial issues between Belgrade and Rome. It wants a deal where a new ambassador does not have to present him or herself to Mr Milosevic. Under the Vienna convention, a new ambassador is only an ambassador-designate until his \"letter of credence\" is accepted by the head of state. So Mr Stewart will be Australia's new ambassador only when Mr Milosevic accepts him.",

The bank, which claims in its TV adverts to be the big bank for the big world, was unrepentant about the unpopular move, insisting it was essential for its long term survival. It also stood firm against demands that figures confirming the size of potential bonus payouts to top directors should be made public. Some calculations would allow Matt Barrett, the chief executive, to receive as much as \u00a330m. In an attempt to quell the critcism, the bank insisted that despite the closures it still had the second largest branch network of all its rivals and that an agreement with the Post Office would give the 3% of its 13m customers affected an alternative way to conduct their banking. John Varley, chief executive of the bank's retail financial services operation, insisted the closures were essential to stop the bank ending up \"in a grave like Rover or NatWest\". He said: \"This industry is going through a seismic change. When industry goes through changes you've got to be at the front and that's something that can be uncomfortable.\" As Barclays pressed ahead with the closures, which will leave 63 towns and villages without a bank at all, Nationwide Building Society said it would install cash machines in up to 70 of the areas where Barclays was shutting and would not charge customers for using them. And, in an attempt to tackle the issues faced by people in rural areas, government advisers are to press ministers to adopt a new charter for the countryside under which people would be guaranteed a minimum number of services, such as public transport, shops, post offices and affordable housing. The government's own countryside agency will shortly present its far-reaching plan as a saviour for more remote communities. With more sevices, such as magistrates courts, facing closure, its chairman, Ewen Cameron, yesterday accused Whitehall of ignoring many problems in the countryside. \"They are putting the expenses on to the people rather than shouldering the expense themselves,\" he said. \"There's a lack of thinking of what life is like in the countryside.\" The charter plan, which is likely to form a key part of a rural white paper later this year, would mean the agency, backed by the government, setting basic standards for services in rural areas. With the countryside now a big election issue, as more people leave cities for the shires, the agency will portray a bleak picture of life in some rural areas in a survey later this month. The Barclays closures were said to have prompted hundreds of protesters to have laid a wreath on the door of the branch at Belford in Northumberland and prompted condemnations from senior church figures. Charles Kennedy, the Liberal Democrat leader, also joined the chorus of dissent. He said: \"This is going down like a lead balloon in many parts of the country, particularly when people see the juxtaposition of this alongside the rather megalomaniac scale of salary increases which have been awarded to top executives.\" But the bank insisted that mass protests outside the doomed branches had failed to materialise. \"There have been no protests or sit ins. Many customers have been bringing in chocolates or champagne for staff. \"After all the negative focus, that is an amazing and reassuring gesture,\" a spokesman said. The closures are part of a plan by Barclays to cut costs and axe 6,000 jobs. While the bank is one of many to be closing branches, it has incurred more criticism than most because some of the branches are the last ones left on the high street. Lloyds TSB, which has the largest branch network, rejected suggestions last night that it had a policy to ensure it was never the last one left, saying it was the sole survivor in 125 towns or villages.",

Like other former mining communities, it has seen a steady erosion of its commercial centre since the closure of the last pit, Wyndham Western, in 1984. It does, however, enjoy the luxury of a second bank. Barclays customers are transferring their business there in droves.

Malcolm Baker, 63, who has used the Barclays branch for more than 10 years, said people in Ogmore Vale were disgusted at the closure. \"I would like to see the people of the valleys transfer their accounts to another bank,\" he said. Mrs Cook, 71, believed that transferring accounts to a rival, as she had, was the only way the valley community could show its contempt for Barclays. \"That advert is about being a big bank but it is made up of an awful lot of little people. They have looked at a map and seen places but they haven't looked at the faces. I don't think they looked at their staff either. It is the staff who have had to face the anger and frustration.\" Despite her criticism of the multi-million pound advertising campaign she reserved her anger for the message, not the messenger, Sir Anthony. \"I wouldn't have thought he would have known about the closures,\" Mrs Cook said. \"We're not holding it against him.\"",

Punitive damages could total as much as $300bn for the illnesses of all of Florida's estimated half million sick smokers.

      "bodyText": "A jury in Miami last night set the stage for a potentially crippling blow to the US tobacco industry by awarding a total of $12.7m in compensatory damages to three sick smokers in a landmark case. The wider significance of the Florida verdict is that it paves the way for punitive damages to be also imposed in the three smokers' class action. Punitive damages could total as much as $300bn for the illnesses of all of Florida's estimated half million sick smokers. A liability of this size would do vast damage to the tobacco industry and could set a crippling new benchmark in other US states in the long-running legal war between health groups and big tobacco interests. The Miami case has become the key flashpoint in the struggle between plaintiffs and the tobacco companies following the US Congress's failure last year to agree to a multi-billion settlement between the federal government, the states and the industry. In their verdict, the jury ordered the tobacco industry to pay two of the plaintiff smokers $6.9m. A third smoker was awarded $5.8m but that award was frozen under the state's four year statute of limitations. Judge Robert Kaye said he would decide later how to handle that award. \"I'm smiling, I'm smiling, I'm smiling,\" plaintiff Frank Amodeo said after the verdict, even though the jury blocked his award. Yesterday's verdict, in the class action suit that has been before the Florida courts for more than a year, concerned only the companies' liability for compensatory damages, which are meant to compensate victims for their medical expenses, pain and suffering. However, once a jury decides that compensatory damages are warranted, it can also consider ordering punitive damages, which, as their name implies, are meant to punish. The tobacco industry has said that it fears the punitive-damage phase could bring a potentially ruinous $300bn verdict. The implications of yesterday's decision extend far beyond the individual circumstances of the three Florida smokers, important though those are. By opening the way to the imposition of punitive damages in tobacco health cases, the verdict puts all the public health and compensation issues back on the table across the US, and makes big tobacco into an election year issue. The Republican presidential candidate George W Bush is heavily funded by tobacco interests and is pledged to introduce widespread \"tort reform\" - a euphemism for passing new laws to protect Mr Bush's big business backers from the financial effects of class actions on issues such as smoking and firearms. Judge Kaye told the jurors that he would call them back to court later this month to start the punitive-damage phase. Martin Feldman, an analyst who follows tobacco stocks for Salomon Smith Barney, said that given Friday's verdict, it appears \"the jury is going to go in there with some tough attitudes about tobacco\" during the punitive-damage phase. RJ Reynolds Tobacco, the maker of Camel and Winston cigarettes, said in a statement that it would appeal against the award. \"The errors committed by the trial judge during this trial are too numerous to mention, but all of them will be raised during our appeal,\" the company said. The case against the tobacco companies was brought by three long-term smokers: Mary Farnan, 44, a nurse from Inglis who began smoking at the age of 11; Angie Della Vecchia, a housewife from New Port Richey, who died in 1999 at the age of 53, and who also began smoking as a child; and Mr Amodeo, a 60-year-old clockmaker from Orlando, who began at 14. The industry argued that Mr Amodeo's cancer was caused by exposure to wood dust at his job and argued that the women suffered from a form of lung cancer not attributed to smoking. But the jury gave the three smokers close to the amounts they asked for. Ms Farnan got $2.85m and the estate of Mrs Della Vecchia was awarded $4.023m. The same jury, which began hearing the case 18 months ago, ruled last July that five cigarette companies and two industry groups conspired to produce a dangerous, addictive product that causes 29 illnesses, including cancer and heart disease.",

The bill now has virtually no chance of being revived after Mr Livingstone failed to muster enough Labour MPs to take the measure to its next parliamentary stage.

Mediation is pragmatic, it does not apportion blame, no sides are taken; mediators call this the win/win approach, because it is relatively quick and inexpensive, particularly compared to a court case, and circumvents the frustration and anger that long-running disputes can cause. As a way of illustrating the power of mediation, we are seeking the help of celebrities who are themselves involved in a long-running dispute, but are now interested in reconciliation. Each programme will focus on one dispute between two famous people. Both parties will talk about the dispute from their point of view (sic), they will then come together with a mediator to reconcile their differences, or at least reach a mutually agreeable truce.\" </p> <p>Of course, the point is that both In The Psychiatrist's Chair and this new one are exactly the sort of thing I delight in listening to/watching with my boyfriend, and shrieking, \"Ohmigod! How can people bear to do that to themselves in public!\" It is a rule of thumb that the radio and TV programmes we most adore are those that we would run a mile not to be on, while we'd consider it a real feather in our cap to appear on those that bore us to tears. I, for one, won't be appearing in the Channel 4 series, because I believe in what Tennessee Williams said: \"Things are only ever black and white.

It was only when the true mother backed down that Solomon handed the baby over to her, but in real life I'm afraid this rarely happens. In real life, it's the good guy who loses out from this sort of carry-on. In Chile and Argentina, the mothers of the Disappeared still wear black, because mediation and reconciliation have let the people who dropped trades unionists from helicopters and tortured three-year-old children in front of their parents get off scot free. Surely only the dimmest IRA groupie (hi, Tone!) hasn't cottoned on yet that the big-time M&amp;R that was the Good Friday Agreement was nothing more than a way for those brave butchers of Omagh to keep all their weapons while getting their goons out of jail. The Third Way is just a kid-gloved approach to letting business demoralise and exploit labour. </p> <p>I'll never forget, also, the seminar organised by liberal Jews and Christians in an effort to reconcile with Muslims, which broke up early when the Muslims began to scream at the Jews and Christians about being blasphemers. Meanwhile, fathers are now routinely allowed to pay supervised visits to children whom they have raped, and I've lost count of the number of women killed in the process of being \"reconciled\" with their violent partners. A few years ago, an Asian woman was actually killed in the very police station where she had fled for protection - when her husband came after her, the police put them in their \"domestic reconciliation unit\" to talk it over. Ten minutes later, she was dead. </p> <p>M&amp;R represents all that is worst about the crusading inertia that so plagues us, the blundering zeal that has all but ruined the quality of everyday life here, in everything from rail privatisation to automated inquiries.

      "bodyText": "The plight of Europe's Gypsies has worsened dramatically in recent years, with increases in racially motivated attacks against them, and rising levels of unemployment, evictions, and even exclusions from their home towns, according to a major new report. The study, by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), also says that, in spite of greater awareness of Gypsy, or Roma, issues, the number of Roma representatives in national parliaments has dropped. Prepared by Max van der Stoel, the OSCE's high commissioner on national minorities, the report came out yesterday on the eve of Roma day, which marks the anniversary of the first international Roma congress in 1971, when Gypsies managed to succeeded in putting their problems on the international agenda. The report deals mainly with the countries of central Europe with high Gypsy populations: the Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia, but it also highlights problems in Italy, France, and other western European countries. It looks at some appalling racial attacks, including a skinhead raid last June on a Gypsy camp near Naples. The camp was burned down, apparently in a revenge attack, after a Gypsy car-driver had seriously injured two girls riding on a motorscooter. In Bulgaria, 14 Gypsies died between 1992 and 1998 while being held in police custody or as a result of police shootings. Many more have been beaten by police, but there have been few attempts by the authorities to investigate. The worst violence has occurred in Kosovo in recent months where tens of thousands of Gypsies have been forced to flee their homes and take refuge in camps guarded by international troops. The collapse of communism across the region and the fall in living standards led to widespread joblessness, with Gypsies often the first to be fired. Drops in income forced some Gypsies to sell their homes. Others were evicted from state-owned flats when they were privatised and their former owners took them over. Private landlords often refused to let to Gypsies. In some places they were even expelled from municipalities. In 1997 Gypsy families were banned from settling in, or even entering, two villages in eastern Slovakia, Nagov and Rokytovce, capping what one mayor called a campiagn \"to get rid of local Romanies\". In 1998 the mayor of Evosmos in Greece ordered the eviction of 3,500 Gypsies from an area that had been their home for 30 years. The report highlights one encouraging development - a housing project in Kremnica in Slovakia for Gypsies and non-Gypsies. Jobless people participated in the building of homes under the leadership of the town's non-Gypsy mayor. Education is the trickiest area, because of constant arguments over when segregated schooling is justifiable. In the main, the use of \"special schools\" has been aimed at excluding Gypsies from mainstream education, but the report mentions one school in Pecs in Hungary run by Gypsies, and aimed at developing a Gypsy intelligentsia. The report condemns involuntary segregation but says that European governments should consider supporting pre-school programmes for Gypsy infants and \"booster\" programmes for Gypsies in ordinary schools. Gypsy parents repeatedly said that they wanted better access to school for their children and blamed poor attendance not on \"Roma values\", but on children's experience of racism when they did go to school, the report says. Mr van der Stoel recommends several measures, from better training for the police in Gypsy issues, including the recruitment of Gypsies into the police, to laws providing for higher sentences for crimes motivated by racism.",

The lyricist (Eric Maschwitz) knew his ornithology. Had he alleged that a nightingale sang in, say, the City Square, Leeds, or Forster Square, Bradford, nobody would have believed him and his song would by now be forgotten.",

The club which has increasingly seemed to have done some terrible deal with destiny is another - my own, Leeds United. Having survived a plane crash which almost wiped out the team on the way back from a London match, Leeds began this year to play attractive, attacking football.

Now (in an incident unrelated to the first except in the sense of continuing a run of bad luck and publicity), they have two fans dead after a pre-match encounter in Istanbul. The football team you support isn't (or shouldn't be) a matter of choice - it follows from where you grew up - and the allegiance should remain almost unbreakable; but Leeds is currently an uncomfortable club to support. There are possible outcomes to the forthcoming trial and the investigation into the Turkish deaths which might make it unbearable. </p> <p>It is not to detract from the tragedy of the families involved to suggest that the tabloid press's presumption of sanctity about the men is usually unwise on the first day of a murder investigation.

Objecting to the decision by the game's ruling bodies that the match should go ahead, Leeds fans complained that this sent the message that \"football is more important than life\". </p> <p>This heartfelt objection misses several points. There was a strong practical reason for the game to proceed. Whether or not football hooliganism was connected with the Istanbul deaths, it would soon get through to psychopathic soccer fans around the world that a reliable way of allowing your side a bye to the next round was knifing a few of the rival fans to death the night before. (Although widely presented as mindless violence, a significant proportion of football hooliganism has been an attempt to force the abandonment of matches.) </p> <p>But, apart from this, the view that the tie should have been moved or removed is illogical. Football is a leisure industry with occasionally lethal consequences. In this, it resembles aviation. Within minutes of the mass murder over Lockerbie, the same airline was flying holiday-makers to the Caribbean. No one objected that vacations were more important than life. At least two Premiership matches this season have started late because of fatal motorway pile-ups. In a strict factual sense those passengers died for football, but it was accepted that the match should proceed, though delayed to allow the safe transport of other fans. A distinction has to be drawn - morally and practically - between incidents which happen at matches (Heysel, Hillsborough) and terrible deaths external to them. </p> <p>And the brutal truth is that football is more important than those lives. In the list of recent Leeds misfortunes, I omitted the fact that they have lost their last four matches and seem likely to end the season as briefly beautiful losers. The media consensus on Thursday was that football no longer mattered after the Istanbul killings. It's what people say after football tragedies. But is it true? Can I really be the only Leeds fan who felt disappointed that they lost on Thursday night and began to calculate the results in the return leg which might yet see them to the final. Even after blood is spilled, it's in the blood. </p> <p>It's because the result always matters that working people pay large sums of money to follow their club to a mid-week fixture in distant Turkey. It's because the result always matters that young men are paid huge sums of money which they spend in nightclubs and elsewhere and become a magnet for attention, with all that may bring. </p> <p>As with recent publicity over the home lives of footballers, the events involving Leeds United this season show a collision between the new image of football - the \"beautiful game\", family orientated, attractive, even cerebral - and the potential ugliness underneath. </p> <p>What's especially upsetting is that, while many unpleasant men with unprintable views have run football clubs in the past, the current Leeds set-up has in chairman Peter Ridsdale and manager David O'Leary prize examples of the sensitive, enlightened, media-friendly, hooligan- hostile new football establishment. Kept awake in Istanbul by shock and duties with the bereaved, they will also have had sleepless moments this week and earlier this year that the thug culture which has blighted football in the past still remains. </p> <p>But, despite all this, I want Leeds to beat Aston Villa tomorrow - and Manchester United to lose catastrophically to Middlesbrough on Monday - and this I suppose is the problem from which all football's other problems follow. The match does always matter.</p>",

Even after blood is spilled, it's in the blood. It's because the result always matters that working people pay large sums of money to follow their club to a mid-week fixture in distant Turkey. It's because the result always matters that young men are paid huge sums of money which they spend in nightclubs and elsewhere and become a magnet for attention, with all that may bring. As with recent publicity over the home lives of footballers, the events involving Leeds United this season show a collision between the new image of football - the \"beautiful game\", family orientated, attractive, even cerebral - and the potential ugliness underneath. What's especially upsetting is that, while many unpleasant men with unprintable views have run football clubs in the past, the current Leeds set-up has in chairman Peter Ridsdale and manager David O'Leary prize examples of the sensitive, enlightened, media-friendly, hooligan- hostile new football establishment. Kept awake in Istanbul by shock and duties with the bereaved, they will also have had sleepless moments this week and earlier this year that the thug culture which has blighted football in the past still remains. But, despite all this, I want Leeds to beat Aston Villa tomorrow - and Manchester United to lose catastrophically to Middlesbrough on Monday - and this I suppose is the problem from which all football's other problems follow. The match does always matter.",

SocGen realises that the \"suspension of reality\" stage, when anyone could do well, is over.

It looks for cash generation, management skills and for companies that can stamp their authority on rivals. And it lets top fund managers manage money - it says too many other groups promote so that fund managers manage people instead. </p> <p><b> Is there a website?</b> </p> <p>Try <a href=\"http://www.sgam.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.sgam.co.uk</a> but while you can look and download a form, you can't yet buy.

Which has been the best fund? Technology has led its sector since launch with a 321% gain and has virtually doubled unit holders' cash over six months. Isn't technology a bit of an up-and-down situation? The proper expression is volatility. SocGen realises that the \"suspension of reality\" stage, when anyone could do well, is over. Now it hopes any tendency to roller-coasterism in the \u00a3300m fund will be dampened down by spreading risks. The dot.com content is less than 3% and the rest of the fund is spread across nearly 100 companies. The trick is to find the next \"big thing\". What happened to Nicola's bet with Richard Branson? The check-pullovered Branson bet Nicola that the SocGen growth fund would not beat his All Share tracker by 2% a year for three years. What's at stake? \u00a36,000. And who's winning? Nicola. Leaving out the initial costs which give Branson a head start, the SocGen fund has gained 32.4% over the first two years compared with 16.7% for the Virgin fund. Is there a SocGen style - other than the photos on the adverts? It all comes down to strict research and sector responsibilities. It looks for cash generation, management skills and for companies that can stamp their authority on rivals. And it lets top fund managers manage money - it says too many other groups promote so that fund managers manage people instead. Is there a website? Try www.sgam.co.uk but while you can look and download a form, you can't yet buy. However, the firm does accept phoned Isa purchase orders. What's SocGen's unique selling proposition? Adding value with style and consistency - then packaging these for the small unit trust investor.",

      "body": "<p>For years folding bikes have been regarded as a bit of a joke - small wheeled contraptions that appear to be more of a gimmick than a serious mode of transport.</p> <p>Despite this image, however, their popularity has been steadily growing with more than 4,000 new bikes being sold in the UK each year. No longer are they the hard to ride, slow to fold contraptions of yesteryear. Instead, they're sophisticated pieces of engineering that can compete on all levels with conventional bicycles.</p> <p>One of their biggest attractions is that they're part of an inter-modal solution to commuting problems. Most rail operators allow folding bikes to be carried free of charge and without restrictions, so you can cycle to the railway station, fold up the bike, travel by train and then ride to work at the other end.</p> <p>Mike Hessey, from the Folding Society, says: \"Once you get to work, the bike can be stored under the desk so avoiding the risk of theft and there's no heavy lock to carry. They take up a minimum of room in the house and can easily be transported in a car. There are some users, though, who are simply attracted by the sheer ingeniousness of the folding bike's design.\"</p> <p>The basic principle behind the bike is that all the parts which stick out - wheels, handlebars and saddle - fold into the centre around the chain. This results in a package the size of large briefcase and which weighs around 12kg. Most designs take an average of 30 seconds or less to assemble (after practice) with another minute or so to fit into the carrying bag.</p> <p>Unfortunately, this level of engineering does not come cheap. Prices start at around \u00a3300 for a basic model and a design classic can rise to more than \u00a34,000. Cheaper bikes can be picked up at warehouses and by mail order for \u00a3100, but these are often very heavy with unreliable folding mechanisms. There is also the price of the carry bag or case to consider which is essential if you are planning to travel by plane.</p> <p>The dominant name in the UK folding bike market is Brompton Cycles which has been operating since the early 80s. Its bikes are claimed to be not only the easiest to fold but also to fold up into the smallest size, due in part to the 16 inch wheels.</p> <p>Its top of the range machine is the T5 (\u00a3613 from Avon Valley Cyclery) which not only has 5-speed hub gears but also dynamo lights, good suspension and a rear rack which can carry loads with ease. This rack then acts as a platform for the bike to stand on, while small wheels allow it to be pulled along like a suitcase.</p> <p>The cheapest Brompton is the L3 (\u00a3341) which has three gears and is a good choice where weight and price are priorities. Accessories are available such as a carrying bag and naturally a folding pedal (\u00a333) which makes the folded size 8 cm narrower. Only one folding pedal is required as the other is hidden by the compressed bike.</p> <p>Brompton may be the popular choice but plenty of other makes are available. From Germany there are Birdy bikes made by Riese und Muller. These are lighter than the Brompton and come with full suspension, although when folded are bulkier and take slightly longer to assemble. However, some devotees say they ride more like rigid conventional bikes. The cheapest Birdy is the Red (\u00a3700) which weighs only 10.5kg while prices rise to \u00a31,300 for the 9-speed Black model. One of the cheapest folding bikes on the UK market is the Brilliant Micro-lite which sells for \u00a3279. These bikes fold up into a package.</p> <p>A different concept is offered by the Strida 2 (\u00a3335) made by Roland Plastics. The bike consists of three lightweight aluminium tubes which are arranged into a triangle. Instead of folding, the three tubes are brought into line with the wheels, clipping together to form what is described as a wheeled stick. This is pulled rather than carried and the whole process takes only 10 seconds to execute.</p> <p>With this machine there is no chance of getting oil on your clothes as there is a drive belt instead of a greasy chain and the bike is said to be corrosion free. This simple one-gear machine is aimed at commuters rather than tourers, but if you're after a bike that stands out it's for you.</p> <p>There again some in the small-wheeled bike world would say that that accolade belongs to Alex Moulton Bicycles. It is debatable as to whether they should be considered alongside folding bikes as they separate into two parts.</p> <p>However, Moultons are ideal for transporting by car and are easy to store. The Land Rover model (\u00a3900), part of the All Purpose Bicycle (APB) range, has 20inch wheels, front and rear suspension and 21 gears. It is in fact a versatile \"urban assault\" bike capable of withstanding the potholes in city streets or off-road trails. Moultons are designed primarily for touring, though, and they're renowned for their big, versatile luggage-carrying capacity as well as providing a comfortable ride even over long distances.</p> <p>When you buy a Moulton you pay for the innovative engineering design and this is no more apparent than in the New Series. Launched in 1998 it was the culmination of 40 years endeavour by Dr Alex Moulton to design a bike, \"more pleasurable to have and more effective to use\", than any other. It has been described as having jewel-like perfection and prices for this 17 inch wheeled bike start at \u00a33,700. For true enthusiasts only.</p>",

      "bodyText": "For years folding bikes have been regarded as a bit of a joke - small wheeled contraptions that appear to be more of a gimmick than a serious mode of transport. Despite this image, however, their popularity has been steadily growing with more than 4,000 new bikes being sold in the UK each year. No longer are they the hard to ride, slow to fold contraptions of yesteryear. Instead, they're sophisticated pieces of engineering that can compete on all levels with conventional bicycles. One of their biggest attractions is that they're part of an inter-modal solution to commuting problems. Most rail operators allow folding bikes to be carried free of charge and without restrictions, so you can cycle to the railway station, fold up the bike, travel by train and then ride to work at the other end. Mike Hessey, from the Folding Society, says: \"Once you get to work, the bike can be stored under the desk so avoiding the risk of theft and there's no heavy lock to carry. They take up a minimum of room in the house and can easily be transported in a car. There are some users, though, who are simply attracted by the sheer ingeniousness of the folding bike's design.\" The basic principle behind the bike is that all the parts which stick out - wheels, handlebars and saddle - fold into the centre around the chain. This results in a package the size of large briefcase and which weighs around 12kg. Most designs take an average of 30 seconds or less to assemble (after practice) with another minute or so to fit into the carrying bag. Unfortunately, this level of engineering does not come cheap. Prices start at around \u00a3300 for a basic model and a design classic can rise to more than \u00a34,000. Cheaper bikes can be picked up at warehouses and by mail order for \u00a3100, but these are often very heavy with unreliable folding mechanisms. There is also the price of the carry bag or case to consider which is essential if you are planning to travel by plane. The dominant name in the UK folding bike market is Brompton Cycles which has been operating since the early 80s. Its bikes are claimed to be not only the easiest to fold but also to fold up into the smallest size, due in part to the 16 inch wheels. Its top of the range machine is the T5 (\u00a3613 from Avon Valley Cyclery) which not only has 5-speed hub gears but also dynamo lights, good suspension and a rear rack which can carry loads with ease. This rack then acts as a platform for the bike to stand on, while small wheels allow it to be pulled along like a suitcase. The cheapest Brompton is the L3 (\u00a3341) which has three gears and is a good choice where weight and price are priorities. Accessories are available such as a carrying bag and naturally a folding pedal (\u00a333) which makes the folded size 8 cm narrower. Only one folding pedal is required as the other is hidden by the compressed bike. Brompton may be the popular choice but plenty of other makes are available. From Germany there are Birdy bikes made by Riese und Muller. These are lighter than the Brompton and come with full suspension, although when folded are bulkier and take slightly longer to assemble. However, some devotees say they ride more like rigid conventional bikes. The cheapest Birdy is the Red (\u00a3700) which weighs only 10.5kg while prices rise to \u00a31,300 for the 9-speed Black model. One of the cheapest folding bikes on the UK market is the Brilliant Micro-lite which sells for \u00a3279. These bikes fold up into a package. A different concept is offered by the Strida 2 (\u00a3335) made by Roland Plastics. The bike consists of three lightweight aluminium tubes which are arranged into a triangle. Instead of folding, the three tubes are brought into line with the wheels, clipping together to form what is described as a wheeled stick. This is pulled rather than carried and the whole process takes only 10 seconds to execute. With this machine there is no chance of getting oil on your clothes as there is a drive belt instead of a greasy chain and the bike is said to be corrosion free. This simple one-gear machine is aimed at commuters rather than tourers, but if you're after a bike that stands out it's for you. There again some in the small-wheeled bike world would say that that accolade belongs to Alex Moulton Bicycles. It is debatable as to whether they should be considered alongside folding bikes as they separate into two parts. However, Moultons are ideal for transporting by car and are easy to store. The Land Rover model (\u00a3900), part of the All Purpose Bicycle (APB) range, has 20inch wheels, front and rear suspension and 21 gears. It is in fact a versatile \"urban assault\" bike capable of withstanding the potholes in city streets or off-road trails. Moultons are designed primarily for touring, though, and they're renowned for their big, versatile luggage-carrying capacity as well as providing a comfortable ride even over long distances. When you buy a Moulton you pay for the innovative engineering design and this is no more apparent than in the New Series. Launched in 1998 it was the culmination of 40 years endeavour by Dr Alex Moulton to design a bike, \"more pleasurable to have and more effective to use\", than any other. It has been described as having jewel-like perfection and prices for this 17 inch wheeled bike start at \u00a33,700. For true enthusiasts only.",

      "body": "<p>The world is waking up to the crucial links between governance and sustainable development. The latest confirmation came the same day we heard the news that the wave-piercing catamaran Team Philips had broken up. That evening, I was in the audience as EU Commissioner Chris Patten gave the first of the 2000 Reith Lectures, whose theme is sustainable development. He warned of a looming crisis in governance, with major economic, social and ecological implications, and underscored the role business must play in sustainable development.</p> <p>As he did so, I spotted a link between the Team Philips disaster and the sustainability challenges business now faces. Not, perhaps, the most obvious link. Yes, the catamaran's revolutionary form reflects the use of computer-aided design and hi-tech carbon fibres. So Team Philips could be seen as a symbol of the much-vaunted New Economy, which may yet prove unexpectedly fragile. But a different link sprang to mind, to do with measuring corporate performance and progress.</p> <p>In his Respect for the Earth lecture, Patten encouraged non governmental organisations (NGOs) to collaborate with business to solve the world's problems. Fine, but few in the NGO sector have much respect for corporations. So how do we build a degree of mutual confidence? One answer is to develop credible measures of corporate progress. But that's easier said than done. If you are in a catamaran bowling along at 40 knots, you know you are making progress. And if a hull has snapped off further progress is unlikely. Luckily, companies now have new and more sensitive measures to assess their environmental progress.</p> <p>Business in the Environment has just launched its fourth Index of Corporate Environmental Engagement and Performance. BP Amoco CEO Sir John Browne, who gives the third Reith lecture this year, finds his company in fourth position. Prince Charles, who hosts the final lecture, notes that some companies are making real headway. He adds: \"If environmental performance is going to be a source of competitive advantage - as it should be - we all need to be able to compare the way companies perform.\"</p> <p>All true, but John Browne and other corporate chieftains face another problem. It may help to show that they are making headway against the triple bottom line, but try telling that to financial analysts. Most just don't get it. Then, as we wallowed around wondering how to build the business case for sustainability to the point where it would convert the most recalcitrant chief financial officer, help appeared from an unlikely quarter.</p> <p>A new value creation index from Ernst &amp; Young and Wharton business school appears in the magazine Forbes ASAP. The results are stunning. Research on factors making companies more valuable shows environmental performance in fifth place. It trails innovation and the ability to attract talented employees, but comes ahead of brand investment, application of technology and customer satisfaction.</p> <p>The Team Philips wreck originally caught my eye because of our own Trimaran project, focusing on how boards handle the triple bottom line. For those of us confronting financial analysts on the sustainable development front, the Forbes ASAP news was like waking and finding that the shattered hull was just a bad dream.</p> <p>\u0095 John Elkington is chairman of strategy consultants SustainAbility (web-site: <a href=\"http://www.sustainability.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.sustainability.co.uk</a>). The Reith Lectures will be broadcast on both Radio 4 (from 12 April) and the BBC World Service (from 16 April).</p>",

      "bodyText": "The world is waking up to the crucial links between governance and sustainable development. The latest confirmation came the same day we heard the news that the wave-piercing catamaran Team Philips had broken up. That evening, I was in the audience as EU Commissioner Chris Patten gave the first of the 2000 Reith Lectures, whose theme is sustainable development. He warned of a looming crisis in governance, with major economic, social and ecological implications, and underscored the role business must play in sustainable development. As he did so, I spotted a link between the Team Philips disaster and the sustainability challenges business now faces. Not, perhaps, the most obvious link. Yes, the catamaran's revolutionary form reflects the use of computer-aided design and hi-tech carbon fibres. So Team Philips could be seen as a symbol of the much-vaunted New Economy, which may yet prove unexpectedly fragile. But a different link sprang to mind, to do with measuring corporate performance and progress. In his Respect for the Earth lecture, Patten encouraged non governmental organisations (NGOs) to collaborate with business to solve the world's problems. Fine, but few in the NGO sector have much respect for corporations. So how do we build a degree of mutual confidence? One answer is to develop credible measures of corporate progress. But that's easier said than done. If you are in a catamaran bowling along at 40 knots, you know you are making progress. And if a hull has snapped off further progress is unlikely. Luckily, companies now have new and more sensitive measures to assess their environmental progress. Business in the Environment has just launched its fourth Index of Corporate Environmental Engagement and Performance. BP Amoco CEO Sir John Browne, who gives the third Reith lecture this year, finds his company in fourth position. Prince Charles, who hosts the final lecture, notes that some companies are making real headway. He adds: \"If environmental performance is going to be a source of competitive advantage - as it should be - we all need to be able to compare the way companies perform.\" All true, but John Browne and other corporate chieftains face another problem. It may help to show that they are making headway against the triple bottom line, but try telling that to financial analysts. Most just don't get it. Then, as we wallowed around wondering how to build the business case for sustainability to the point where it would convert the most recalcitrant chief financial officer, help appeared from an unlikely quarter. A new value creation index from Ernst &amp; Young and Wharton business school appears in the magazine Forbes ASAP. The results are stunning. Research on factors making companies more valuable shows environmental performance in fifth place. It trails innovation and the ability to attract talented employees, but comes ahead of brand investment, application of technology and customer satisfaction. The Team Philips wreck originally caught my eye because of our own Trimaran project, focusing on how boards handle the triple bottom line. For those of us confronting financial analysts on the sustainable development front, the Forbes ASAP news was like waking and finding that the shattered hull was just a bad dream. \u0095 John Elkington is chairman of strategy consultants SustainAbility (web-site: www.sustainability.co.uk). The Reith Lectures will be broadcast on both Radio 4 (from 12 April) and the BBC World Service (from 16 April).",

When things go the way I intended, with people believing in what they are doing. Which was your greatest mistake? There are lots of mistakes, the key thing is to remember them so that, hopefully, I won't repeat them. What do you find most annoying in your staff? People who don't do what they say they will. Does your organisation have a glass ceiling? Not at all. The Global Technology Industry Group of PricewaterhouseCoopers promotes the entrepreneurial spirit and initiative, so I am confident that such barriers are non-existent. What management wisdom is most overrated? Globalisation is the current buzz word, but first you need to identify the right business model for your company and tailor it to local needs, otherwise it's just globalony. What one lesson would you pass on to young managers? To be a team player and not be afraid of changing a strategy or decision if it's not working. Which management guru do you believe in? My father who opened the first Coopers office in Milan, in 1957. Who is your management hero? There are many, mainly in the technology industry as in some sense they are pioneers. Bill Gates is one of them. Who is your favourite politician? I do not particularly care about politicians, but I would name Bill Clinton for what he has done for the US economy and the world peace process. Do you think European executives are overpaid? No, but mentalities and measurement systems should be changed to ensure that good performers are rewarded accordingly. Apart from your family, what else makes you happiest in life? To see people around me enjoying what they do, learning from it and coming to me for advice - professional and personal. What annoys you most? When people tell me, \"no, I cannot do it\" before I've even finished asking. How do you relax? I enjoy building models with wood and playing with radio-controlled cars and planes. What was your last cultural experience? It was more a spiritual experience, when I visited the Vatican and had the honour of being blessed by the Pope. What is your favourite city? New York, in short doses, otherwise Geneva where we currently live. What is your greatest regret? Not to have continued my career as a grand-prix driver. What will be the big business issue of the next decade? To handle the effects of change that fast-evolving technology brings. What would you really like to have been? The mind behind the internet!",

      "body": "<p>The Fulani of Mali have a picturesque creation myth. The Fulani live and die by dairy farming. Not surprisingly, therefore, they believe that the world began as a great globule of milk. Then the god Doondari descended, and from the milk he created stone. In due course, the stone created iron, the iron created fire, the fire created water and the water created air. When this chain reaction was complete and the five elements were in place, Doondari came down a second time and shaped the elements into people.</p> <p>But the people proved to be proud. So Doondari created blindness, and blindness defeated the people. When blindness itself became proud, Doondari created sleep, and sleep defeated blindness. And when sleep in turn became too proud, Doondari created worry. And worry defeated sleep.</p> <p>Worry. Like breathing and eating, it is something that all humans do. The Fulani will have their own word for it. But they'll do it in exactly the same way as people in Birmingham. Our word comes from the Old Frisian wergia , meaning \"to kill\". Deep into the 17th century, to worry a person or an animal was to strangle them; to seize them by the throat with one's teeth, to tear and lacerate them, and to shake the life out of them. As time went by and the word matured, it was left to dogs to keep up this vicious sort of worrying, usually with sheep, while we more sophisticated creatures graduated to figurative worrying by means of hostile and menacing speech, employed repeatedly and over prolonged periods.</p> <p>It was this dogged persistence that soon became the hallmark of worrying. Victims would be plagued and pestered with reiterated demands and worn down by repeated attacks. By and by, people began to speak in terms of worrying away at intractable problems, coming at those problems again and again, until they had whittled them down to nothing.</p> <p>And so the scene was set for a kind of linguistic crossover in which the worrier became the worried, and the worried became the worry. For it was now possible for a person to lie in bed at night, worrying away at life's problems in the hope of defeating them by daybreak, and at the same time to be worried by those problems. To be beset by worries. To be doubly a worrier. No wonder it keeps us awake in our beds.</p> <p>I need help. I cannot fall asleep at night. I've tried doctors' medications, OTC piles, everything, but nothing works. When I lie down in bed, I cannot stop my mind from thinking. Even good things that happen, I just can't turn it off. I feel sleepy at night, but once I'm in the bed, there goes the brain, thinking about anything and everything. Like I said, I've seen doctors, with no results. I went to a sleep clinic, but they only wanted to study me while I was sleeping. That's not my problem! It's getting to sleep. Anyone that can help me, please! Several times it's almost come to either I get to sleep or get the gun. I'm desperate. I need help.<br> <b> Message posted to the SleepNet insomnia bulletin board by John D at 11.57pm, September 4, 1998</b></p> <p>What John needs, perhaps, is a good book. Something like Stop Worrying: Understand Your Anxiety And Banish It Forever! by Frank J Bruno. Or 365 Bible Promises For People Who Worry (A Little Or A Lot), by Alice Chapin. Or The Worrywart's Companion: Twenty-One Ways To Soothe Yourself And Worry Smart, by Dr Beverly Potter. Perhaps this is the one. Worry: Controlling It And Using It Wisely, by Edward M Hallowell.</p> <p>Hallowell is a senior lecturer at Harvard Medical School and a founder-director of a centre for cognitive and emotional health. He's been worrying away at worry for years. Worry, he says, is what we humans are good at. It's our thing. \"To create worry,\" he says, \"humans elongate fear with anticipation and memory, expand it in imagination and fuel it with emotion. The uniquely human mental process called worrying depends upon having a brain that can reason, remember, reflect, feel, and imagine. Only humans have a brain big enough to do this simultaneously and do it well.\"</p> <p>Of course there's humans and there's humans, and there's worrying and there's worrying. Healthy worry he describes as \"the root of planning\". At the other extreme is full-blown paranoia. A worrying disposition may be tied up with a diagnosable condition such as depression, attention deficit disorder or generalised anxiety disorder. And some people may indeed be born worriers, genetically wired to worry themselves sick.</p> <p>But even they can retrain their brains into new patterns, says Hallowell. It's a question of breaking out of the cycle and moving on. He recommends \"connectedness\" - opening up to other people, to other ideas, and to our spiritual sides. Sometimes medication and psychotherapy are required. Other times, exercise will do it - or yoga, or a change of diet. And some people, he reckons, just need to get good insurance.</p> <p>In a matter of seconds the body is transformed. To prepare for exertion, blood pressure and heart rate rocket; the liver pours out glucose and calls up fat reserves to be processed for energy; the circulatory system diverts blood from nonessential functions, such as digestion, to the brain and muscles. This is precisely what you need if your goal is to survive the next 10 minutes. <br><b> Description of flight-or-fight syndrome, Time/Life</b></p> <p>We all know about stress. We've all heard of flight-or-fight syndrome. In the past two decades, it has received more attention than any other human condition. But although worry may lead to stress, and via stress to indigestion, ulcers, a depressed immune system and, ultimately, death, it is of itself a rather different animal. Webster's medical dictionary defines worry as \"a mental distress or agitation resulting from concern, usually for something impending or anticipated\". Dr Carole Clarke, a clinical psychologist, has pinned it down more precisely. Worry, he says, is the mental counterpart of anxiety. We worry about things we fear may happen at another time, or which we fear are happening now, but in another place. It is \"a way - a poor one - to try to control the future or events and other people at a distance\".</p> <p>Too bad that worry often ends up controlling us. But we can master it, says Clarke. And if we can control our conscious worrying, then we can also affect the reservoir of anxiety that our worry has left behind in our unconscious. The quickest way of doing this is to control what he calls \"self-talk\".</p> <p>Self-talk, he says, is the perpetual conversation we have with ourselves. \"We all have ongoing internal dialogues about concerns, hopes, plans, decisions and so forth, and we can easily observe what we're saying to ourselves, how we're saying it, when we're saying it and what are our perspectives, intentions and directions. Worry involves a great deal of self-talk. Controlling worry can be easily accomplished by intentionally intervening in that internal dialogue.</p> <p>\"Usually, when we worry, we have conversations with ourselves about distressing things we anticipate happening.\" The key word here, says Clarke, is \"anticipate\", because the worry is about something that hasn't happened and may or may not happen. \"Worry is always about something imaginary. Something that doesn't yet exist. Worry, in fact, is the process of becoming distressed about the non-existent. Put in that perspective, it seems rather silly and useless.</p> <p>\"When you are worried about something, you are having distressing conversations with yourself about things you imagine might happen or be happening outside your observation. Because you are literally worried about nothing - these events are in your mind, not in your real, physical environment - there is nothing you can do about the objects of your worry. You are stuck. You are helpless. You can't do anything about nothing.\"</p> <p>But it's possible, says Clarke, to intervene in these internal dialogues as if one were an outside, objective mediator. \"You can transform these dialogues into useful and productive activities that allay the fears you feel and break the useless cycle of mental 'awful'-ising.\"</p> <p>The first thing to do to stop the \"awful\"-ising is to apply thought-stopping, says Clarke. \"Simply say 'Stop' in your mind. Mentally shout it, if necessary. Whenever you find yourself worrying, stop the dialogue this way immediately. This may sound too easy, but it really works.\"</p> <p>The next step is to replace the worry dialogue with a practical dialogue. \"The events you are anticipating really might occur, and you can't waste your time stuck in the worry cycle. You have to plan your most probable effective responses to the most probable future events. You have to determine if there is anything you can do right now to prevent or modify those events. Talk to yourself about what probably will happen and what you can do about it.\"</p> <p>According to legend, Guatemalan children used to tell one worry to each doll when they went to bed at night and then placed the dolls under their pillows. In the morning the dolls had taken their worries away. Each worry doll we make is a sign of our sorrows for the 140,000 dead and disappeared in Guatemala. The dolls symbolise our united stand - with the students of Guatemala - to demand accountability. For each worry doll you and others make, commit to taking an action on behalf of those who suffered the human-rights violations during the Guatemala Civil War. MATERIALS: Wooden Doll Pins, Popsicle or Craft Sticks, Hot Glue Gun or School Glue, Masking Tape, Scissors, Markers, Yarn...<br><b> Amnesty International USA, Make A Worry Doll campaign</b></p> <p>Julia Cole, an agony aunt and a counsellor with Relate, is convinced that action is the key to conquering worry. And over the years, she has worked out a neat strategy for ending the cycle of anxiety. You don't need popsicles or glue guns, leotards or rowing machines to try her method. Just a pen and a sheet of paper.</p> <p>\"Some worries are essential,\" says Cole. \"They are spurs to action. But some people become obsessive worriers. They just can't get things out of their brain. And quite often, it's the lack of action that's the problem. They find themselves worrying because they don't know what action to take, and that creates a vicious circle.\" So she tells clients to select a day at random and write out a list of all the worries that come to them. At end of the day, they should divide those worries into three categories.</p> <p>\"Category One consists of the things that you can't personally change - global or political events, say. Category Two are things that you can change, such as asking your partner or children to come home on time. And in Category Three, you put the things that you can change but don't really want to because you're actually quite happy with the status quo.</p> <p>\"The next stage is to look at Category One and ask yourself if there is anything at all that you could do to allay those worries. For instance, let's say you're worried about the greenhouse effect, or children not having enough to eat in Africa. You might decide to join Greenpeace or put some money in an envelope for Africa. All right, so it's probably a drop in the ocean, but it's an action, and it might help those worries not to loom so large.</p> <p>\"In Category Two, take action on things you can positively change. And if they don't change, then you need to review the situation after a week, say, and in the meantime, stop worrying about it and stop letting the stress build up inside you. As for Category 3 worries, well, you have to allow yourself a sense of perspective. If you've eaten two chocolate bars today, it probably isn't a good idea to eat a third, but it's not the end of the world.</p> <p>\"However, if you find that things get stuck in one category, then try to move them into an action phase. Always try to do something. If you can't, well that's life. But if you can, it will help you. It will disarm the worry - make it less powerful. And it will prevent that circling which compulsive and obsessive worriers often talk about.\"</p> <p>Writing things down - it's a tried and tested formula. Sherlock Holmes swore by it. Research in Germany, says Cole, has shown that people with painful arthritis suffered less if they wrote down how they were feeling each day.

But one day soon, it might be able to straighten out its owner more effectively than all the beads and dolls and pebbles in the world. It's happening already in a small way. Dr Judy Proudfoot and a team at the Institute of Psychiatry have just got together with Ultramind, a company specialising in interactive healthcare programmes, to produce Beating The Blues. What it offers is a glimpse of the future.</p> <p>Beating The Blues consists of six CD-ROMs, and is designed to be operated under supervision in GPs' surgeries, where it is currently undergoing trials. \"There is a shortage of about 1,000 psychologists and properly qualified cognitive behaviour therapists in the country,\" says Proudfoot, \"and waiting lists can be up to two years. So the idea is that, when a GP diagnoses anxiety and/or depression, the patient is referred to the computer instead of being given pills or put on a waiting list.\"</p> <p>The programme consists of eight sessions - one session a week - with activities and tasks to complete in between. And it uses a combination of TV documentary-type case studies and interactive therapeutic activities that encourage patients to apply the techniques to their everyday situations.</p> <p>\"They are cognitive therapy techniques,\" says Proudfoot. \"So it's analysing and challenging their thinking, looking at their behaviour and their deeply held beliefs, and helping them to tap into their thinking and see whether it's distorted. It's a huge programme, and it's not just for people with clinical worrying. It could be for someone who goes to their doctor and says 'I'm distressed' or 'I'm stressed'. And we've got a module in there on sleep management.</p> <p>\"Studies show that some patients actually prefer it to face-to-face therapy, because they can see the therapist as judgmental. And computer-based programmes in the US have been shown to be as effective as face-to-face therapy. I chose to locate this in GP surgeries because I wanted to put more sophisticated techniques in it and I wanted that minimal clinical supervision. If there are problems, the GP can take steps to give further support. But there is certainly other stuff happening that patients will be able to use at home, and on the internet as well. It's not too far away.\"</p> <p>But will it take more than cyber-shrinks to keep our rambling brains in check? According to the Fulani of Mali, worry defeated sleep. But the matter didn't end there.

      "bodyText": "The Fulani of Mali have a picturesque creation myth. The Fulani live and die by dairy farming. Not surprisingly, therefore, they believe that the world began as a great globule of milk. Then the god Doondari descended, and from the milk he created stone. In due course, the stone created iron, the iron created fire, the fire created water and the water created air. When this chain reaction was complete and the five elements were in place, Doondari came down a second time and shaped the elements into people. But the people proved to be proud. So Doondari created blindness, and blindness defeated the people. When blindness itself became proud, Doondari created sleep, and sleep defeated blindness. And when sleep in turn became too proud, Doondari created worry. And worry defeated sleep. Worry. Like breathing and eating, it is something that all humans do. The Fulani will have their own word for it. But they'll do it in exactly the same way as people in Birmingham. Our word comes from the Old Frisian wergia , meaning \"to kill\". Deep into the 17th century, to worry a person or an animal was to strangle them; to seize them by the throat with one's teeth, to tear and lacerate them, and to shake the life out of them. As time went by and the word matured, it was left to dogs to keep up this vicious sort of worrying, usually with sheep, while we more sophisticated creatures graduated to figurative worrying by means of hostile and menacing speech, employed repeatedly and over prolonged periods. It was this dogged persistence that soon became the hallmark of worrying. Victims would be plagued and pestered with reiterated demands and worn down by repeated attacks. By and by, people began to speak in terms of worrying away at intractable problems, coming at those problems again and again, until they had whittled them down to nothing. And so the scene was set for a kind of linguistic crossover in which the worrier became the worried, and the worried became the worry. For it was now possible for a person to lie in bed at night, worrying away at life's problems in the hope of defeating them by daybreak, and at the same time to be worried by those problems. To be beset by worries. To be doubly a worrier. No wonder it keeps us awake in our beds. I need help. I cannot fall asleep at night. I've tried doctors' medications, OTC piles, everything, but nothing works. When I lie down in bed, I cannot stop my mind from thinking. Even good things that happen, I just can't turn it off. I feel sleepy at night, but once I'm in the bed, there goes the brain, thinking about anything and everything. Like I said, I've seen doctors, with no results. I went to a sleep clinic, but they only wanted to study me while I was sleeping. That's not my problem! It's getting to sleep. Anyone that can help me, please! Several times it's almost come to either I get to sleep or get the gun. I'm desperate. I need help.

Something like Stop Worrying: Understand Your Anxiety And Banish It Forever! by Frank J Bruno. Or 365 Bible Promises For People Who Worry (A Little Or A Lot), by Alice Chapin. Or The Worrywart's Companion: Twenty-One Ways To Soothe Yourself And Worry Smart, by Dr Beverly Potter. Perhaps this is the one. Worry: Controlling It And Using It Wisely, by Edward M Hallowell. Hallowell is a senior lecturer at Harvard Medical School and a founder-director of a centre for cognitive and emotional health. He's been worrying away at worry for years. Worry, he says, is what we humans are good at. It's our thing. \"To create worry,\" he says, \"humans elongate fear with anticipation and memory, expand it in imagination and fuel it with emotion. The uniquely human mental process called worrying depends upon having a brain that can reason, remember, reflect, feel, and imagine. Only humans have a brain big enough to do this simultaneously and do it well.\" Of course there's humans and there's humans, and there's worrying and there's worrying. Healthy worry he describes as \"the root of planning\". At the other extreme is full-blown paranoia. A worrying disposition may be tied up with a diagnosable condition such as depression, attention deficit disorder or generalised anxiety disorder. And some people may indeed be born worriers, genetically wired to worry themselves sick. But even they can retrain their brains into new patterns, says Hallowell. It's a question of breaking out of the cycle and moving on. He recommends \"connectedness\" - opening up to other people, to other ideas, and to our spiritual sides. Sometimes medication and psychotherapy are required. Other times, exercise will do it - or yoga, or a change of diet. And some people, he reckons, just need to get good insurance. In a matter of seconds the body is transformed. To prepare for exertion, blood pressure and heart rate rocket; the liver pours out glucose and calls up fat reserves to be processed for energy; the circulatory system diverts blood from nonessential functions, such as digestion, to the brain and muscles. This is precisely what you need if your goal is to survive the next 10 minutes. Description of flight-or-fight syndrome, Time/Life We all know about stress. We've all heard of flight-or-fight syndrome. In the past two decades, it has received more attention than any other human condition. But although worry may lead to stress, and via stress to indigestion, ulcers, a depressed immune system and, ultimately, death, it is of itself a rather different animal. Webster's medical dictionary defines worry as \"a mental distress or agitation resulting from concern, usually for something impending or anticipated\". Dr Carole Clarke, a clinical psychologist, has pinned it down more precisely. Worry, he says, is the mental counterpart of anxiety. We worry about things we fear may happen at another time, or which we fear are happening now, but in another place. It is \"a way - a poor one - to try to control the future or events and other people at a distance\". Too bad that worry often ends up controlling us. But we can master it, says Clarke. And if we can control our conscious worrying, then we can also affect the reservoir of anxiety that our worry has left behind in our unconscious. The quickest way of doing this is to control what he calls \"self-talk\". Self-talk, he says, is the perpetual conversation we have with ourselves. \"We all have ongoing internal dialogues about concerns, hopes, plans, decisions and so forth, and we can easily observe what we're saying to ourselves, how we're saying it, when we're saying it and what are our perspectives, intentions and directions. Worry involves a great deal of self-talk. Controlling worry can be easily accomplished by intentionally intervening in that internal dialogue. \"Usually, when we worry, we have conversations with ourselves about distressing things we anticipate happening.\" The key word here, says Clarke, is \"anticipate\", because the worry is about something that hasn't happened and may or may not happen. \"Worry is always about something imaginary. Something that doesn't yet exist. Worry, in fact, is the process of becoming distressed about the non-existent. Put in that perspective, it seems rather silly and useless. \"When you are worried about something, you are having distressing conversations with yourself about things you imagine might happen or be happening outside your observation. Because you are literally worried about nothing - these events are in your mind, not in your real, physical environment - there is nothing you can do about the objects of your worry. You are stuck. You are helpless. You can't do anything about nothing.\" But it's possible, says Clarke, to intervene in these internal dialogues as if one were an outside, objective mediator. \"You can transform these dialogues into useful and productive activities that allay the fears you feel and break the useless cycle of mental 'awful'-ising.\" The first thing to do to stop the \"awful\"-ising is to apply thought-stopping, says Clarke. \"Simply say 'Stop' in your mind. Mentally shout it, if necessary. Whenever you find yourself worrying, stop the dialogue this way immediately. This may sound too easy, but it really works.\" The next step is to replace the worry dialogue with a practical dialogue. \"The events you are anticipating really might occur, and you can't waste your time stuck in the worry cycle. You have to plan your most probable effective responses to the most probable future events. You have to determine if there is anything you can do right now to prevent or modify those events. Talk to yourself about what probably will happen and what you can do about it.\" According to legend, Guatemalan children used to tell one worry to each doll when they went to bed at night and then placed the dolls under their pillows. In the morning the dolls had taken their worries away. Each worry doll we make is a sign of our sorrows for the 140,000 dead and disappeared in Guatemala. The dolls symbolise our united stand - with the students of Guatemala - to demand accountability. For each worry doll you and others make, commit to taking an action on behalf of those who suffered the human-rights violations during the Guatemala Civil War. MATERIALS: Wooden Doll Pins, Popsicle or Craft Sticks, Hot Glue Gun or School Glue, Masking Tape, Scissors, Markers, Yarn... Amnesty International USA, Make A Worry Doll campaign Julia Cole, an agony aunt and a counsellor with Relate, is convinced that action is the key to conquering worry. And over the years, she has worked out a neat strategy for ending the cycle of anxiety. You don't need popsicles or glue guns, leotards or rowing machines to try her method. Just a pen and a sheet of paper. \"Some worries are essential,\" says Cole. \"They are spurs to action. But some people become obsessive worriers. They just can't get things out of their brain. And quite often, it's the lack of action that's the problem. They find themselves worrying because they don't know what action to take, and that creates a vicious circle.\" So she tells clients to select a day at random and write out a list of all the worries that come to them. At end of the day, they should divide those worries into three categories. \"Category One consists of the things that you can't personally change - global or political events, say. Category Two are things that you can change, such as asking your partner or children to come home on time. And in Category Three, you put the things that you can change but don't really want to because you're actually quite happy with the status quo. \"The next stage is to look at Category One and ask yourself if there is anything at all that you could do to allay those worries. For instance, let's say you're worried about the greenhouse effect, or children not having enough to eat in Africa. You might decide to join Greenpeace or put some money in an envelope for Africa. All right, so it's probably a drop in the ocean, but it's an action, and it might help those worries not to loom so large. \"In Category Two, take action on things you can positively change. And if they don't change, then you need to review the situation after a week, say, and in the meantime, stop worrying about it and stop letting the stress build up inside you. As for Category 3 worries, well, you have to allow yourself a sense of perspective. If you've eaten two chocolate bars today, it probably isn't a good idea to eat a third, but it's not the end of the world. \"However, if you find that things get stuck in one category, then try to move them into an action phase. Always try to do something. If you can't, well that's life. But if you can, it will help you. It will disarm the worry - make it less powerful. And it will prevent that circling which compulsive and obsessive worriers often talk about.\" Writing things down - it's a tried and tested formula. Sherlock Holmes swore by it. Research in Germany, says Cole, has shown that people with painful arthritis suffered less if they wrote down how they were feeling each day. And if you keep a diary, she says, \"you can always look at next year and see how this year's worries just turned to dust\". Like Clarke, Cole believes that worry is often a way of attempting to control events and people. \"It's the worrying - the planning and thinking about what will happen, that actually allows the worrier to have a kind of odd control over their life, because they assume and pre-empt. For some worriers, it's almost a protection against life. \"A worrier will say to you, well, if I do A, B will occur, if I do B, C will occur. It's almost as if they're playing a game, and it's often about a desire to control and a fear that if they speak up against the boss who's been harassing them, say, they will be giving some control to the boss.

Advertisement by Exotic Imports on www.exoticimports.com The computer on your desktop may not have the wherewithal to worry. But one day soon, it might be able to straighten out its owner more effectively than all the beads and dolls and pebbles in the world. It's happening already in a small way. Dr Judy Proudfoot and a team at the Institute of Psychiatry have just got together with Ultramind, a company specialising in interactive healthcare programmes, to produce Beating The Blues. What it offers is a glimpse of the future. Beating The Blues consists of six CD-ROMs, and is designed to be operated under supervision in GPs' surgeries, where it is currently undergoing trials. \"There is a shortage of about 1,000 psychologists and properly qualified cognitive behaviour therapists in the country,\" says Proudfoot, \"and waiting lists can be up to two years. So the idea is that, when a GP diagnoses anxiety and/or depression, the patient is referred to the computer instead of being given pills or put on a waiting list.\" The programme consists of eight sessions - one session a week - with activities and tasks to complete in between. And it uses a combination of TV documentary-type case studies and interactive therapeutic activities that encourage patients to apply the techniques to their everyday situations. \"They are cognitive therapy techniques,\" says Proudfoot. \"So it's analysing and challenging their thinking, looking at their behaviour and their deeply held beliefs, and helping them to tap into their thinking and see whether it's distorted. It's a huge programme, and it's not just for people with clinical worrying. It could be for someone who goes to their doctor and says 'I'm distressed' or 'I'm stressed'. And we've got a module in there on sleep management. \"Studies show that some patients actually prefer it to face-to-face therapy, because they can see the therapist as judgmental. And computer-based programmes in the US have been shown to be as effective as face-to-face therapy. I chose to locate this in GP surgeries because I wanted to put more sophisticated techniques in it and I wanted that minimal clinical supervision. If there are problems, the GP can take steps to give further support. But there is certainly other stuff happening that patients will be able to use at home, and on the internet as well. It's not too far away.\" But will it take more than cyber-shrinks to keep our rambling brains in check? According to the Fulani of Mali, worry defeated sleep. But the matter didn't end there. For worry itself became too proud, and so Doondari created death to defeat him. Ultimately, of course, death got out of hand as well. He always does. And when that happened, Doondari knew he had to put in another personal appearance. He descended for the third time, and he came as Gueno the Eternal One. And Gueno defeated death \u0095 Extracts from Worry - And How Not To reproduced by permission of CS Clarke, PhD.

The Palace of Westminster and Highgate Hill were always there, as was the Post Office Tower.

Integral to her design was the rooftop glass pavilion, which is circled by 3,500 sq ft of decked roof garden. \"I love seeing the change in the seasons.

Which is what the fruit can taste like if you buy the wrong stuff. </p> <p><strong> The basics</strong><br> Why are avocados strange? Well, they contain serious quantities of fat - 20%-30%. The name comes from an Aztec word meaning 'butter from the wood' (according to one source) or 'testicle' (according to another). You decide. They do not ripen if they're left on the tree. And they lose sugar in the course of ripening. More prosaically, they grow in warm, humid climates; there are more than 500 varieties, or cultivars; Israel is a big supplier to you and me.</p> <p> <strong> The details</strong><br> We can buy avocados all year round, but some are the pits.

      "bodyText": "The subject Persea americana and close relations; Central American native; strange fruit. Formerly an exotic rarity. Currently as ubiquitous as paper. Which is what the fruit can taste like if you buy the wrong stuff. The basics Why are avocados strange? Well, they contain serious quantities of fat - 20%-30%. The name comes from an Aztec word meaning 'butter from the wood' (according to one source) or 'testicle' (according to another). You decide. They do not ripen if they're left on the tree. And they lose sugar in the course of ripening. More prosaically, they grow in warm, humid climates; there are more than 500 varieties, or cultivars; Israel is a big supplier to you and me. The details We can buy avocados all year round, but some are the pits. Undisputed all-time champion and hero: the Hass variety, born in California in 1926, with purplish, thick, knobbly skin.

While demonstrating how to make a caesar salad dressing on BBC2's Food And Drink recently, chef/presenter Antony Worrall Thompson gleefully incorporated a raw egg into the mix, passing on the good \"news\" that ,\"since January 1, we no longer have to worry about salmonella bacteria in eggs, as from that date the Lion Quality Mark guarantees salmonella-free eggs\".</p> <p>For its part, the Egg Information Service, the public-relations wing of the British Egg Industry Council (BEIC), hailed its vaccination programme as \"a new dawn for British eggs\", with massive adverts in the national press, though these stopped short of declaring that vaccination equals salmonella-free eggs. The problem is that other people might jump to that conclusion. This slight reserve apart, BEIC chairman, Andrew Parker, felt confident enough about this techno-fix for the industry's once intractable salmonella problem to offer the following assurance: \"Although no food can ever be 100% safe, we believe that Lion Quality eggs are now among the safest in the world - if not the safest.\" Not content with that grandiose claim, the egg industry is singlehandedly taking the credit for the noticeable decline in cases of Salmonella enteriditis PT4 over the past two years, attributing it to the gradual introduction of the vaccine.</p> <p>It all sounds so reassuring. But, according to Dr Richard North, the highly-respected public-health consultant and leading authority on food poisoning, \"these claims encourage a false level of confidence in British eggs\". The first loose end that doesn't quite fit the BEIC's \"new dawn for eggs\" plot is the fact that, although the vaccine may have a temporary efficacy against systemic, internal infection of hens with Salmonella enteriditis , it is wholly ineffective against surface contamination of the shell, which is the most common form of contamination encountered. The next thing to bear in mind is that invasive pathogens such as Salmonella enteriditis are cyclical in nature, with roughly a 10-year lifespan. The problem with UK eggs was first identified in 1988, so it may well be that the recent decline in poisoning cases simply reflects the natural cycle of that particular outbreak. Alternatively, there's the possibility that the drop in the number of cases reflects hygiene improvements that have been made by the broiler chicken (chicken meat) industry, and not by egg producers at all. It's hard to be sure, especially when Public Health Laboratory Service figures record only the total number of Salmonella enteriditis cases, and do not distinguish between those caused by table birds and eggs.</p> <p>Let's not forget about the poor old egg-laying hen, either. She now has to put up with yet another vaccination to add to the already comprehensive list of 13 different shots that she may already require to fortify her against the diseases endemic to the intensive battery-cage system that produces some 84% of the UK's eggs. \"This latest vaccine is yet another perfect example of drugs and veterinary treatments that prop up a cruel and unsustainable system of egg production\" says Philip Lymbery of Compassion in World Farming.</p> <p>Nor do vaccines address the great unspoken egg industry scandal in the disparity between egg production and consumption. While egg production is steady throughout the year, consumption is not. The peaks for egg sales are Christmas and Easter, while they nosedive in January. However, as producers are not allowed to store or refrigerate their eggs when demand slackens, says Dr North, they either have to comply with the law and lose money or find ruses with which to perpetrate the myth that their eggs are fresher than they really are. (Two years ago, I reported how two leading producers had been prosecuted for altering the date stamp on their eggs.) To overcome this potential loop-hole, Dr North supports the implementation of a marketing law that would allow only fresh eggs to be sold as Grade 1 and older eggs as Grade 2, making them clearly destined for recipes in which the eggs are well-cooked. This, North believes, would encourage producers to be more honest. In the meantime, it pays to be suspicious of the egg that may have been hanging around a bit, despite its notional \"lay\" date. The older your egg is, from whatever source, the more likely it is to poison you, since Salmonella enteriditis multiplies rapidly with age. A fresh salmonella-infected egg may not make you ill (unless you are old, infirm or have a compromised immune system), but that same egg a fortnight on might very well do so.</p> <p>So, whatever the season, if you fancy a proper a\u00efoli, say, or an authentic tiramisu, please buy the freshest eggs you can find and eat them that day or the next. And if it's a real mayonnaise you're after, stick to Mrs Beeton's sage household advice: make sure it contains a hefty shot of vinegar to inhibit anything nasty lurking in the eggs.</p>",

If the worst comes to the worst we can always move house.\" \"I don't see why we should move house just because of him! I hate stalkers and if he dares to come over here I want you to kill him.\" Agree cheerfully, then prepare to flee as I can hear Aunt puffing up the stairs again. She is my stalker. \"Echinacea!\" she cries - halfway between Eureka and Abracadabra. She has identified a plant that has only benign properties, and is happy again. Everybody has a stalker but me - except for the brooding presence of my pupil Gabrielle. Even as I idly surf the net I am aware that I ought to be marking her essay on Romeo and Juliet, and that tomorrow evening her shadow will fall across my threshold. There is something about her which paralyses me. Instead of wit and enlightenment, all I can offer is fumble and mumble. I just hope she's not listening. In fact, I'm sure she's not. This thought cheers me up, and I am halfway through counting a few other blessings when the phone rings. It is Elaine, ex-Spouse's other ex-wife. \"I want to talk to you, Dulcie,\" she says, with deadly composure. \"I want to meet you for a face-to-face. I think it's time you knew about all the affairs Gordon had while he was married to you - not counting me, of course.\" Enquire if Thursday will be convenient.",

She tries to close every easy escape that I might resort to in my reply. \"There are only so many tripods, posts and vertical supports that one can accommodate in a garden,\" she protests. And if I suggest she should grow large-flowered clematis as being less vigorous than the Viticella types, well, she prefers the latter, thank you very much. So do I. They have a far longer flowering season than the earlier, large-flowered hybrids, and have a more natural habit of growth.</p> <p>But as to there being limited scope for posts and vertical supports, I don't see it. An upright post takes up virtually no lateral space at all, and it makes use of vertical space that would otherwise go to waste. The ideal is to cut later-flowering clematis hard back at the end of the season, and to tie or train its new shoots to the post in the following year. This will take all the clematis's weight, but if there is a nearby shrub over which it can negligently fling the odd vine, a delightful picture will result without any damage being done. For the rest, you'll have a column of blossom up your post and everyone will be happy.</p> <p>If you do allow a clematis to grow over a shrub, you must ensure that it is the right clematis - that is, not too enveloping and creative of darkness beneath it; and that it is the right sort of shrub - in other words, one that is of stiff habit and able to stand added weight on top of it without collapsing.</p> <p>An ideal example for a number of years in my garden has been of Clematis * triternata 'Rubromarginata' growing over the top of Mahonia * media 'Buckland'. The mahonia, which flowers in December, has a very strong, chunky framework because, every three years or so, I lop it back all over (right now is the ideal moment) to prevent it from becoming leggy and, in my eyes, ungainly. It breaks freely from the bare wood so exposed, and its flowering next winter is unaffected.</p> <p>The clematis is a hybrid between white C. flammula , whose delicious airborne scent it inherits, and purple C. viticella . There are purple margins to a pale-centred flower. It is extremely prolific in its July-August season, but without producing very much foliage. So, as soon as it has flowered, by the end of August, we cut back all that flowered growth and the mahonia is freed for the next nine months.</p> <p>No vertical post is involved in this case. But in another, I have the June to July-flowering Viticella hybrid 'Etoile Violette' growing up a fairly short chestnut pole - short because the clematis is quite near to the front of a mixed border. It got there by accident, I have to admit, its roots being in some old potting soil with which we topped the border up. At the time, we didn't realise that a living clematis was being included, but we soon did, and we didn't like to discourage it. Well, it grew with a vengeance and killed a couple of daisy bushes, Olearia * scilloniensis , before we appreciated that the situation was critical and provided the post.</p> <p>Next door is an extremely strong and stiff Hybrid Tea rose, the pink 'Paul McCartney', alias 'The McCartney Rose', alias 'Meizeli'. Some of the clematis strays harmlessly on to that and, as the clematis itself is purple with a white eye, the team works excellently. The July-flowering 'Perle d'Azur' is one of the best summer-flowering, near-blue clematis around, but it has tremendously long internodes that give it a rangy habit. It is quite a heavyweight. 'Prince Charles' is far shorter-jointed and less consuming of space. Its flowers are of the same colouring, but a lot smaller - however, as is always the case, size is compensated for by the numbers of blooms produced.</p> <p>So here we have a prolific clematis of moderate growth and I grow it over the clear pink-flowered Hebe 'Watson's Pink'. Thanks to mild winters, this is 6ft high. Its texture is rather soft, but it copes well and the two colours are charming together. I daresay the situation will have to be reviewed - I fancy that the hebe would benefit from a hard cut-back itself - but we constantly need to adjust. Nothing tragic about that.</p> <p>As for growing something through my own enormous yet by no means stiff Mexican orange, Choisya ternata , to pep it up after its May flowering, I have Berberidopsis corallina , an evergreen climber with pendant clusters of rich-red flowers in summer.

The change in her fortune looks like the result of a voters' backlash against Mr Guiliani's gung-ho endorsement of the New York police department's shooting tactics. After several months in which she seemed incapable of capturing the political initiative from the normally popular Mr Guiliani, Mrs Clinton has a 49% to 41% lead, having trailed her Republican rival by two points as recently as mid-February. When undecided voters were pressed to reveal which way they were leaning, her lead in the poll for the New York Times and CBS News increased to 52-42%. Mrs Clinton, who is trying to become the first wife of a US president to win elective office, probably owes the lead less to her efforts than to a dramatic collapse of Mr Giuliani's approval ratings since the latest shooting of an unarmed black suspect by a New York police officer. A Haitian-born American, Patrick Dorismond, was shot dead in a struggle with a plainclothes drugs squad officer on March 16. It is the most recent in a succession of high-profile killings by NYPD officers. The following day Mr Giuliani released Dorismond's extensive arrest record and said in a series of interviews that the dead man was \"no altar boy\"and his behaviour had contributed to his killing. In the new poll, one third of voters - including 15% of Republicans - said Mr Giuliani's handling of the shooting had made them less inclined to vote for him in the senate elections in November.

They said his injuries were a result of military action rather than a criminal act.",

      "body": "<p>There are strange neighbours at the public record office in Kew: Dick Turpin and Queen Victoria, Jack the Ripper and Shakespeare, Robin Hood and Elton John.</p> <p>A new visitor centre, to be opened by the lord chancellor next week, will display for the first time some of the most unexpected and precious items among the 96 miles of records covering 1,000 years of British history.</p> <p>Some of the oddest things in the collection - such as the spikes on which the Cato Street Conspirators planned, in 1820, to impale members of the cabinet - lie side by side with the treasures: Magna Carta, the Domesday Book, and the solid gold 16th century seal of Francis I of France, which entered the public records attached to a \"treaty of perpetual peace\" signed with Henry VIII, an agreement that lasted all of six months.</p> <p>Shakespeare's will of 1616, which famously left Anne Hathaway his \"second best bed\", has a case of its own. Only half a dozen Shakespeare signatures regarded as genuine have survived, and three are on this will.</p> <p>Nearby there is an extremely dull looking piece of officialese: a deed poll recording that on December 8 1971 a young man called Reginald Kenneth Dwight changed his name to Elton Hercules John. The rest is pop history.</p> <p>Every member of staff had nominations from the huge collection: it was left to the curator, Tracy Borman, to choose just 40 objects for the opening exhibition. She slipped in some personal favourites, including a census return of 1851. A woman called Victoria is listed as living at Buckingham Palace: under occupation it gives \"queen\", but under \"relation to head of household\" some brave official has filled in \"wife\".</p> <p>Ms Borman, a Tudor historian by training, wanted to include the record of Anne Boleyn's trial, but the huge volume was too big for any case. Instead there is a fond, friendly, casual letter which cost another queen's head: Catherine Howard's letter in 1541 hoping that Thomas Culpepper was feeling better. It was taken as proof of adultery. Culpepper was hanged and quartered in December, Catherine's head rolled two months later, and Henry VIII moved on to his sixth and last wife.</p> <p>A long, tedious 14th century manuscript is an account of porters' wages for the king's chamber, for November 1324. One of them, being paid off with 20 days wages because for some unstated reason he could no longer work, was a certain \"Robyn Hod\", his departure from the royal service possibly marking the start of a new career in Sherwood forest.</p> <p>An equally dull document masks another figure famous in stories and ballads: the indictment, for stealing \"a black mare worth three pounds and a filly foal worth twenty shillings\" is of one \"John Palmer, alias Richard Turpin.\" The highwayman, having cheated the law for years, hanged for \u00a34 of horseflesh.</p> <p>The old public record office, in its shabby Victorian splendour in Chancery Lane, Holborn, had a small museum. None of the treasures has been on display since the move to Kew in the 1990s, because the planned new museum was dropped as building costs spiralled. The new exhibition space will be open, free, every day from Monday to Saturday.</p> <p>Some documents have never been displayed before, such as a letter - in an elegant, educated hand - sent to the Central News Agency on September 25 1888, which may have been by Jack the Ripper and sparked a flood of fake letters to the newspapers and police.</p> <p>There is only one notable absentee: the public records rat is out on loan to the Royal Armouries for its millennium exhibition at the Tower of London. The mummified rat was found among the files in the 19th century, and was judged to have devoured so many documents that it warranted inclusion in the public records: it was solemnly given its own record number and filed. \"We are looking forward to his return,\" Ms Borman said. \"He will certainly go straight into the exhibition.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "There are strange neighbours at the public record office in Kew: Dick Turpin and Queen Victoria, Jack the Ripper and Shakespeare, Robin Hood and Elton John. A new visitor centre, to be opened by the lord chancellor next week, will display for the first time some of the most unexpected and precious items among the 96 miles of records covering 1,000 years of British history. Some of the oddest things in the collection - such as the spikes on which the Cato Street Conspirators planned, in 1820, to impale members of the cabinet - lie side by side with the treasures: Magna Carta, the Domesday Book, and the solid gold 16th century seal of Francis I of France, which entered the public records attached to a \"treaty of perpetual peace\" signed with Henry VIII, an agreement that lasted all of six months. Shakespeare's will of 1616, which famously left Anne Hathaway his \"second best bed\", has a case of its own. Only half a dozen Shakespeare signatures regarded as genuine have survived, and three are on this will. Nearby there is an extremely dull looking piece of officialese: a deed poll recording that on December 8 1971 a young man called Reginald Kenneth Dwight changed his name to Elton Hercules John. The rest is pop history. Every member of staff had nominations from the huge collection: it was left to the curator, Tracy Borman, to choose just 40 objects for the opening exhibition. She slipped in some personal favourites, including a census return of 1851. A woman called Victoria is listed as living at Buckingham Palace: under occupation it gives \"queen\", but under \"relation to head of household\" some brave official has filled in \"wife\". Ms Borman, a Tudor historian by training, wanted to include the record of Anne Boleyn's trial, but the huge volume was too big for any case. Instead there is a fond, friendly, casual letter which cost another queen's head: Catherine Howard's letter in 1541 hoping that Thomas Culpepper was feeling better. It was taken as proof of adultery. Culpepper was hanged and quartered in December, Catherine's head rolled two months later, and Henry VIII moved on to his sixth and last wife. A long, tedious 14th century manuscript is an account of porters' wages for the king's chamber, for November 1324. One of them, being paid off with 20 days wages because for some unstated reason he could no longer work, was a certain \"Robyn Hod\", his departure from the royal service possibly marking the start of a new career in Sherwood forest. An equally dull document masks another figure famous in stories and ballads: the indictment, for stealing \"a black mare worth three pounds and a filly foal worth twenty shillings\" is of one \"John Palmer, alias Richard Turpin.\" The highwayman, having cheated the law for years, hanged for \u00a34 of horseflesh. The old public record office, in its shabby Victorian splendour in Chancery Lane, Holborn, had a small museum. None of the treasures has been on display since the move to Kew in the 1990s, because the planned new museum was dropped as building costs spiralled. The new exhibition space will be open, free, every day from Monday to Saturday. Some documents have never been displayed before, such as a letter - in an elegant, educated hand - sent to the Central News Agency on September 25 1888, which may have been by Jack the Ripper and sparked a flood of fake letters to the newspapers and police. There is only one notable absentee: the public records rat is out on loan to the Royal Armouries for its millennium exhibition at the Tower of London. The mummified rat was found among the files in the 19th century, and was judged to have devoured so many documents that it warranted inclusion in the public records: it was solemnly given its own record number and filed. \"We are looking forward to his return,\" Ms Borman said. \"He will certainly go straight into the exhibition.\"",

John Hart, 40, who stood to inherit \u00a31.4m from his friend and neighbour Lawrence Dabbs after his death, claimed that the inquest was \"fundamentally flawed\" and had turned into a criminal trial. Mr Dabbs, 74, was found dead in September 1996 at his home in Ilkeston, Derbyshire. In a will written only a month before his death, the widower left \u00a31.4m, the bulk of his estate, to Mr Hart, a law student from Marlpool, Heanor. But Mr Hart is still fighting for his share of the will in the face of opposition from Mr Dabbs's relatives, who are challenging the validity of the will in the high court. The judge heard that Mr Hart - who was arrested in connection with the death, although the case against him was subsequently dropped - had been \"ostracised\" since the inquest verdict. Mr Justice Newman dismissed Mr Hart's challenge to the verdict of unlawful killing returned by a coroner's jury in July 1998 after a 22-day inquest. He rejected claims that the inquest had been allowed to \"degenerate into a criminal trial\" and allegations that Derbyshire police had taken part in the inquest to gather evidence for a possible prosecution - \"a forbidden purpose\" under the law. The judge also rejected claims that the Derby and South Derbyshire coroner, Peter Ashworth, had \"in effect been complicit in an abuse of the inquest proceeding\". He was satisfied the coroner had carried out a \"scrupulously fair\" inquiry. The high court heard that the crown prosecution service decided before the inquest there was not enough evidence to prosecute anyone over Mr Dabbs's death. The judge ruled that contacts Mr Ashworth had with CPS officials before the inquest were \"harmless\". Mr Hart, who was not in court to hear the ruling, was ordered to pay legal costs estimated to exceed \u00a3100,000, should he inherit substantial sums from Mr Dabbs's will. An application by Mr Hart for leave to appeal to the court of appeal was adjourned.",

Now anyone may drive past the former guard post, admire the monumental new sculpture by the late Michael Kenny, and have some marinaded lamb and a nice glass of chardonnay in the arts centre wine bar.</p> <p>The entire perimeter fence around the former United States air base is coming down, returning hundreds of acres of Berkshire heathland to the people.</p> <p>It is almost 10 years since the cruise missiles left. The gates, home to women's peace camps for 18 years, are now gone as well.</p> <p>The base buildings are flourishing as a business park, with 90% of the space let. A gigantic aircraft hangar is full of jam, another offers ballroom dancing, and firms storing secure documents will lease the armoury and the command centre built to withstand nuclear blast.</p> <p>Most of the runway has been ground up and sold as aggregate for the Newbury bypass, but the millionth ton is being crushed into a cube, a bizarre feature for the planned visitor centre. The centre will be in the watchtower which once kept a wary eye on the cruise missile convoys coming in, the bombers taking off. Astonishingly frequently the watchers saw military police converging on the chanting slogan-spraying protesters who had made it to the heart of the most secure air base in Britain, dancing their defiance on the roofs of the nuclear silos.</p> <p>The cross of concrete where the two runways met will stay as a permanent memorial. Nearby the last bomb on Greenham Common is lying in a heap of gravel - a battered dummy, made as a welding training exercise by soldiers. It will also go to the visitor centre.</p> <p>\"You could not have a name with a more calamitous resonance than Greenham Common,\" Stuart Tagg said. \"Our challenge is to turn it around and make something positive of it.\"</p> <p>The positive is that he is chief executive of the only business park whose name is familiar all over the world.</p> <p>The history of Greenham Common can be traced in hundreds of court actions, taken against the protesters, or by them.

      "bodyText": "Today the fence comes down. For decades thousands of unannounced visitors to Greenham Common had to make their own arrangements: they tunnelled, climbed over the perimeter fence, or brought bolt cutters to cut their way in. Now anyone may drive past the former guard post, admire the monumental new sculpture by the late Michael Kenny, and have some marinaded lamb and a nice glass of chardonnay in the arts centre wine bar. The entire perimeter fence around the former United States air base is coming down, returning hundreds of acres of Berkshire heathland to the people. It is almost 10 years since the cruise missiles left. The gates, home to women's peace camps for 18 years, are now gone as well. The base buildings are flourishing as a business park, with 90% of the space let. A gigantic aircraft hangar is full of jam, another offers ballroom dancing, and firms storing secure documents will lease the armoury and the command centre built to withstand nuclear blast. Most of the runway has been ground up and sold as aggregate for the Newbury bypass, but the millionth ton is being crushed into a cube, a bizarre feature for the planned visitor centre. The centre will be in the watchtower which once kept a wary eye on the cruise missile convoys coming in, the bombers taking off. Astonishingly frequently the watchers saw military police converging on the chanting slogan-spraying protesters who had made it to the heart of the most secure air base in Britain, dancing their defiance on the roofs of the nuclear silos. The cross of concrete where the two runways met will stay as a permanent memorial. Nearby the last bomb on Greenham Common is lying in a heap of gravel - a battered dummy, made as a welding training exercise by soldiers. It will also go to the visitor centre. \"You could not have a name with a more calamitous resonance than Greenham Common,\" Stuart Tagg said. \"Our challenge is to turn it around and make something positive of it.\" The positive is that he is chief executive of the only business park whose name is familiar all over the world. The history of Greenham Common can be traced in hundreds of court actions, taken against the protesters, or by them. The common was bought by the local council as a public recreation area, and almost instantly requisitioned by the Ministry of Defence in 1939. After the war it was briefly returned, then requisitioned again in the dawn of the cold war. The council eventually reluctantly sold, under threat of compulsory purchase. In the 1980s the cruise missiles arrived, and the common became an international focus of anti-nuclear protests. The missiles were gradually pulled out in the years after the December 1987 disarmament treaty between the Soviet Union and the US, and in 1992 the common was declared to be militarily redundant. On the eve of the new millennium, after 18 years, a party was held formally ending the women's peace camp. The Greenham Common Trust, established by the council and local business interests, bought the land for \u00a37m, and immediately sold the open land, 750 acres - considerably larger than the original common - back to the council for \u00a31. The trust has promised a work of art for every new building, as the tatty old military buildings are gradually replaced. The first piece of public sculpture has already arrived, Broken Symmetry, the last major work by Michael Kenny. The artist chose his own site for the circular platform and angular uprights, in steel and Kilkenny limestone, with great care. The finished sculpture was delivered in sections by truck some months ago. When local builders began to assemble it they came back to the trust in consternation - something was wrong, they said, they could not make the pieces fit together according to the sculptor's minutely detailed drawings. After some frantic telephone calls between Ireland and Greenham Common it emerged that they had the wrong stones. They were hastily reconsigned to the Imperial War Museum, and their own sculpture arrived by the next ferry. The flat roof of the command centre may now become an observation platform where visitors can look out over a remarkably unspoiled landscape. Increasingly rare heathland flowers and plants have flourished in the shadow of the cruise missiles. Deer, badgers and hawks are regularly seen, and any visitor will see the new wave of trespassers, with an equally cavalier attitude to fencing and \"keep out\" notices - the common's ever increasing rabbit colony.",

Noye said the 21-year-old had shouted at him: \"I will kill you\" and ignored several pleas to calm down.</p> <p>Noye, 52, described how he staved off Cameron by pulling a 4in lock knife from the pocket of his jeans, one that he kept there because he said he was in constant fear of his life.

He will take the knife and definitely use it on me. So I struck out with the knife. I can't remember exactly how I done it, but I accept it was twice.\"</p> <p>Far from being a violent man, Noye said he could not fight. \"I've never hurt anyone. I've never hurt an animal.\"</p> <p>He had left the UK the following day because, he said: \"The police detest me. I would never get a fair trial here.\"</p> <p>Stephen Batten QC, defending Noye, told the jury his client was acquitted in December 1985 of the murder of DC John Fordham, an undercover officer Noye stabbed when he found him hiding in the garden of his home in West Kingsdown, Kent. Fordham was wearing a balaclava and camouflage. As in this case, Noye pleaded self-defence. Noye also admitted being sentenced to 14 years for dishonestly handling gold stolen during the Brink's-Mat gold bullion robbery at Heathrow airport in 1983.</p> <p>His four and a half hours in the witness box on the seventh day of the trial held court two of the Old Bailey spellbound. Wearing blue trousers, a light blue shirt and a grey cardigan, Noye's walk from the dock to the stand took him within feet of Stephen Cameron's parents, Ken and Toni, who gripped each other's hands as the man accused of murdering their son swore an oath on the Bible.</p> <p>Noye said he left home on Sunday May 19 1996 to drive to a pub in Chislehurst to have a drink with friends. On the way, he saw a red Rascal van but said he did not remember \"cutting up\" the vehicle, as the prosecution claimed. He thought he recognised the driver, Danielle Cable, as a woman he met in a nightclub with his friend Mickey Taylor.</p> <p>When the van started flashing its lights at the next set of traffic lights, he got out. The moment he saw the couple he realised it was a case of mistaken identity, but Cameron, the passenger in the van, had got out to confront him, the court heard.</p> <p>\"I said, 'Sorry mate, I thought you were someone else.' He just started. I said, 'Sorry,' and he said: 'You will be, you C-U-N-T - I will kill you.' As he came at me, I see his face, and I knew I was in trouble.</p> <p>\"I have done nothing. Nothing. I have not antagonised or done anything.\"</p> <p>Noye said he came close to being run over by a lorry as Cameron kicked and pushed him into the road. Another \"full- frontal\" blow knocked him to his knees and left him clinging to the bumper of his Land Rover Discovery, he said.</p> <p>Noye said he tried to get away, but Cameron \"came up behind me and done me in the back\". At that point, he reached for the knife. \"He was facing me. I said, 'Don't come near me, you nutcase.' I was holding [the knife] outstretched. He stood there for a second or two. His girlfriend got out of the van and said, 'Don't go near him.' That just fired him up. He came straight at me. The fight started again. He has punched me and given a few kicks and then I said, 'Hold up, hold up.' He's telling me he's going to kill me. He was in a completely wild rage. He grabbed me and started smashing me in the face. I was trying to get back, to get away from him.</p> <p><b> Shaking</b><br></p> <p>\"I cannot fight, I was worn out. I didn't have nothing left. I thought, I cannot take much more and no one has tried to stop the fight. So I struck out.\"</p> <p>Noye said he drove off wondering \"why a person would fight like that\".</p> <p>He told the jury: \"I was shaking. I had a bloody face. I was just devastated.\"</p> <p>When he returned home that afternoon, his wife, Brenda, asked him what had happened. \"She has seen my face. I said, 'I have been in a fight.' She was not too happy. She said 'I've heard. It was on the news. The chap's dead.' \"</p> <p>Later that evening, Noye decided to flee the country after discussing his predicament with a friend, whom he refused to name in court. \"If I go down the police station, I knew myself what would happen,\" Noye said. \"I would never be believed, I would never get a fair trial. All those witness statements would, without a shadow of doubt, have been tainted against me.\"</p> <p>The unnamed associate took Noye's car and the knife and said, \"Leave them with me.\" Neither has ever been found.</p> <p>Mr Batten turned to Noye's background, asking him what he felt about the press coverage of the Fordham case.</p> <p>\"It was absolutely scandalous. There's no other word for it.\"</p> <p>Noye said he had been taken to court \"like a monkey in a box\" and that jurors who had been told they could not befriend officers who were protecting them were spotted \"laughing and joking\" during trips to Marks &amp; Spencer.</p> <p>After his release from prison in 1994, he said he had feared being \"fitted up\" by the police and being kidnapped by criminals who believed that he knew where three tonnes of missing Brink's-Mat gold had been hidden.</p> <p>\"They [the police] thought I had it,\" Noye told the jury.</p> <p>He told how a close friend, Nicky Whiting, had been kidnapped and stabbed to death in mysterious circumstances, even though he had had nothing to do with the bullion robbery. \"I was in fear of my life from two sources. The police definitely detested me and I had it in my mind that they would pull in a villain who had done something really serious and would get them to do something to me.\"</p> <p>There had been occasions when he felt the police were after him, the court heard.</p> <p>An American who had approached him while they were serving time in prison asked him whether he would swap gold for cocaine. Noye said: \"His name was John O'Boyle. I found out later he was working for the FBI.\"</p> <p>Noye said the fear of reprisals made him carry a knife.</p> <p>During cross-examination Julian Bevan QC reminded Noye that he told a Spanish extradition hearing he had not been at the scene of the stabbing.</p> <p>\"That, of course, was a total lie on your part?\" Noye replied: \"Yes.\"</p> <p>Mr Bevan added: \"Since then you have completely changed tack and you put forward a defence of self-defence?\" Noye said: \"Well, that is true.\"</p> <p>When asked how he came to have a false passport under the name of Green, Noye said: \"I bought it off a mate of mine. When he came out to Spain, he brought it with him.\"</p> <p>Asked how he had financed his life on the run, Noye said he did not need funds from the UK. \"I had money in Spain. As much as I wanted. I'd been doing deals previously.\"</p> <p>The trial was adjourned until Monday.</p> <p><b>'I didn't want to fight. I can't fight. I was forced into it'</b></p> <p><b>Noye on the stabbing of Stephen Cameron</b> \"I didn't want to fight. I can't fight. I was forced into something that I did not want to do.\"</p> <p><b>Noye on violence</b> \"I said to my sons from when they were little, if you ever get into a fight, just walk away. You are not being a coward. You never know what will happen.\"</p> <p><b>Noye said he carried a knife because he thought it was legal </b> \"I would have preferred a stun gun or CS canister but they are illegal. A stun gun would have been much better really.\"</p> <p><b>Asked why he had registered his car in a false name, Noye said:</b> \"I didn't want anyone to know where I lived. I didn't want anyone to know what cars I drove.\"</p> <p><b>During cross-examination, Julian Bevan QC, prosecuting, described how Noye had denied being at the scene at all during extradition hearings in Spain.</b></p> <p>\"That, of course, was a total lie on your part?\"</p> <p>Noye: \"Yes.\"</p> <p>Mr Bevan: \"Which you told to help your cause at that time?\"</p> <p>Noye: \"Yes.\"</p> <p>Mr Bevan: \"Since then, of course, you have completely changed tack and put forward a defence of self-defence?\"</p> <p>Noye: \"Well, that is true.\"</p> <p>Mr Bevan: \"You thought nothing of telling the Spanish court a complete lie to help your position?\"</p> <p>Noye: \"Yes.\"</p> <p>Mr Bevan: \"So if you hadn't been found by the police in Spain you were never going to come back?\"</p> <p>Noye: \"Yes.\"</p> <p>Mr Bevan: \"And face some responsibility, as you had, leaving the parents of this boy totally ignorant?\"</p> <p>Noye: \"Yes, they would have been.\"</p> <p><b>On the stabbing</b> Mr Bevan: \"Mr Noye, the truth is that so far as this incident is concerned you became angry with that young man and deliberately stabbed him, didn't you?\"</p> <p>Noye: \"No, I am quite a placid man. I did not do that. It is not true.\"</p> <p>Mr Bevan: \"And you ran away in fear, not fear of not having a fair trial, you ran away in fear of the truth emerging from all the people at that junction?\"</p> <p>Noye: \"Well, the truth has emerged.\"</p>",

Noye also admitted being sentenced to 14 years for dishonestly handling gold stolen during the Brink's-Mat gold bullion robbery at Heathrow airport in 1983. His four and a half hours in the witness box on the seventh day of the trial held court two of the Old Bailey spellbound. Wearing blue trousers, a light blue shirt and a grey cardigan, Noye's walk from the dock to the stand took him within feet of Stephen Cameron's parents, Ken and Toni, who gripped each other's hands as the man accused of murdering their son swore an oath on the Bible. Noye said he left home on Sunday May 19 1996 to drive to a pub in Chislehurst to have a drink with friends. On the way, he saw a red Rascal van but said he did not remember \"cutting up\" the vehicle, as the prosecution claimed. He thought he recognised the driver, Danielle Cable, as a woman he met in a nightclub with his friend Mickey Taylor. When the van started flashing its lights at the next set of traffic lights, he got out. The moment he saw the couple he realised it was a case of mistaken identity, but Cameron, the passenger in the van, had got out to confront him, the court heard. \"I said, 'Sorry mate, I thought you were someone else.' He just started. I said, 'Sorry,' and he said: 'You will be, you C-U-N-T - I will kill you.' As he came at me, I see his face, and I knew I was in trouble. \"I have done nothing. Nothing. I have not antagonised or done anything.\" Noye said he came close to being run over by a lorry as Cameron kicked and pushed him into the road. Another \"full- frontal\" blow knocked him to his knees and left him clinging to the bumper of his Land Rover Discovery, he said. Noye said he tried to get away, but Cameron \"came up behind me and done me in the back\". At that point, he reached for the knife. \"He was facing me. I said, 'Don't come near me, you nutcase.' I was holding [the knife] outstretched. He stood there for a second or two. His girlfriend got out of the van and said, 'Don't go near him.' That just fired him up. He came straight at me. The fight started again. He has punched me and given a few kicks and then I said, 'Hold up, hold up.' He's telling me he's going to kill me. He was in a completely wild rage. He grabbed me and started smashing me in the face. I was trying to get back, to get away from him. Shaking \"I cannot fight, I was worn out. I didn't have nothing left. I thought, I cannot take much more and no one has tried to stop the fight. So I struck out.\" Noye said he drove off wondering \"why a person would fight like that\". He told the jury: \"I was shaking. I had a bloody face. I was just devastated.\" When he returned home that afternoon, his wife, Brenda, asked him what had happened. \"She has seen my face. I said, 'I have been in a fight.' She was not too happy. She said 'I've heard. It was on the news. The chap's dead.' \" Later that evening, Noye decided to flee the country after discussing his predicament with a friend, whom he refused to name in court. \"If I go down the police station, I knew myself what would happen,\" Noye said. \"I would never be believed, I would never get a fair trial. All those witness statements would, without a shadow of doubt, have been tainted against me.\" The unnamed associate took Noye's car and the knife and said, \"Leave them with me.\" Neither has ever been found. Mr Batten turned to Noye's background, asking him what he felt about the press coverage of the Fordham case. \"It was absolutely scandalous. There's no other word for it.\" Noye said he had been taken to court \"like a monkey in a box\" and that jurors who had been told they could not befriend officers who were protecting them were spotted \"laughing and joking\" during trips to Marks &amp; Spencer. After his release from prison in 1994, he said he had feared being \"fitted up\" by the police and being kidnapped by criminals who believed that he knew where three tonnes of missing Brink's-Mat gold had been hidden. \"They [the police] thought I had it,\" Noye told the jury. He told how a close friend, Nicky Whiting, had been kidnapped and stabbed to death in mysterious circumstances, even though he had had nothing to do with the bullion robbery. \"I was in fear of my life from two sources. The police definitely detested me and I had it in my mind that they would pull in a villain who had done something really serious and would get them to do something to me.\" There had been occasions when he felt the police were after him, the court heard. An American who had approached him while they were serving time in prison asked him whether he would swap gold for cocaine. Noye said: \"His name was John O'Boyle. I found out later he was working for the FBI.\" Noye said the fear of reprisals made him carry a knife. During cross-examination Julian Bevan QC reminded Noye that he told a Spanish extradition hearing he had not been at the scene of the stabbing. \"That, of course, was a total lie on your part?\" Noye replied: \"Yes.\" Mr Bevan added: \"Since then you have completely changed tack and you put forward a defence of self-defence?\" Noye said: \"Well, that is true.\" When asked how he came to have a false passport under the name of Green, Noye said: \"I bought it off a mate of mine. When he came out to Spain, he brought it with him.\" Asked how he had financed his life on the run, Noye said he did not need funds from the UK. \"I had money in Spain. As much as I wanted. I'd been doing deals previously.\" The trial was adjourned until Monday. 'I didn't want to fight. I can't fight. I was forced into it' Noye on the stabbing of Stephen Cameron \"I didn't want to fight. I can't fight. I was forced into something that I did not want to do.\" Noye on violence \"I said to my sons from when they were little, if you ever get into a fight, just walk away. You are not being a coward. You never know what will happen.\" Noye said he carried a knife because he thought it was legal \"I would have preferred a stun gun or CS canister but they are illegal. A stun gun would have been much better really.\" Asked why he had registered his car in a false name, Noye said: \"I didn't want anyone to know where I lived. I didn't want anyone to know what cars I drove.\" During cross-examination, Julian Bevan QC, prosecuting, described how Noye had denied being at the scene at all during extradition hearings in Spain. \"That, of course, was a total lie on your part?\" Noye: \"Yes.\" Mr Bevan: \"Which you told to help your cause at that time?\" Noye: \"Yes.\" Mr Bevan: \"Since then, of course, you have completely changed tack and put forward a defence of self-defence?\" Noye: \"Well, that is true.\" Mr Bevan: \"You thought nothing of telling the Spanish court a complete lie to help your position?\" Noye: \"Yes.\" Mr Bevan: \"So if you hadn't been found by the police in Spain you were never going to come back?\" Noye: \"Yes.\" Mr Bevan: \"And face some responsibility, as you had, leaving the parents of this boy totally ignorant?\" Noye: \"Yes, they would have been.\" On the stabbing Mr Bevan: \"Mr Noye, the truth is that so far as this incident is concerned you became angry with that young man and deliberately stabbed him, didn't you?\" Noye: \"No, I am quite a placid man. I did not do that. It is not true.\" Mr Bevan: \"And you ran away in fear, not fear of not having a fair trial, you ran away in fear of the truth emerging from all the people at that junction?\" Noye: \"Well, the truth has emerged.\"",

      "bodyText": "The controversy over whether the rape law should be reformed to bring more rapists to justice was reopened yesterday when a senior judge warned that pressures for change could risk imprisoning innocent men. His comments came as he freed a man who spent 15 years in jail for a rape which \"almost certainly never happened at all\". Roy Burnett, 56, was jailed for life in 1986 after a jury accepted evidence from a 20-year-old nurse that she had been raped and seriously assaulted. But yesterday three judges quashed his conviction and accepted that the woman had probably faked her own injuries and fabricated the allegations. Lord Justice Judge said the papers in the \"profoundly disturbing case\" had been sent to the director of public prosecutions for a decision on whether the woman should be prosecuted. The judge, sitting in London with Mr Justice Wright and Mrs Justice Rafferty, said: \"If nothing else, this case provides a salutary reminder that an allegation of rape is not always true and that the man against whom it is made is not necessarily guilty. \"It should serve to ensure that proper safeguards against the wrongful conviction of innocent individuals are preserved. If so, then, although of no comfort whatever to Mr Burnett, something positive will have been salvaged from this disaster.\" The judge said a re-examination of the evidence given at the Old Bailey in1986 revealed many inconsistencies in the woman's various accounts of what happened and her description of her alleged assailant. Mr Burnett always protested his innocence but had no grounds for an appeal until 1998, when the Metropolitan police decided to re-open his case after the woman made a false allegation of rape to Devon police. Yesterday it emerged that she had made more than a dozen complaints to Devon police in the last three years, covering a range of allegations from a snatched handbag to threats to kill. Mr Burnett's conviction was quashed just days after ministers received the report of a government steering group on sex offences which recommended that the definition of rape should be changed from sex without consent to sex without \"free agreement\". The idea is to make it harder for an accused to get off in cases where his defence is that the woman was willing to have sex or he honestly believed she was willing. The steering group's proposals would not affect cases where the defence is that the incident is totally fabricated. One QC said yesterday that he believed the abolition of the requirement in sex cases for judges to warn that it was dangerous to convict on the accuser's word alone - repealed after a campaign by women's groups - could lead to more wrongful convictions. Another QC, Anthony Scrivener, thought cases like Mr Burnett's could happen because the law was reluctant to allow investigation into the complainant's mental state. Michel Massih, the QC who won the acquittal of the London University student Austen Donellan on charges of raping a fellow student who was drunk, warned against making any changes to rape law. Mr Massih, who has represented several men who later proved to have been falsely accused, added: \"It's a very hard slog to obtain materials to enable us to fight these cases.\" In one case his client was in custody for two years before \"purely by luck we managed to obtain a letter disclosing the woman had made multiple allegations of rape\".",

He mentioned it in a riveting aside in his interview this week with Robert Harris in the American magazine, Talk. More significant than (though related to) his indiscreet hints about a Lib Dem alliance was his confirmation that the great goal of Blairism is \"to take class out of British politics\" - which is to say, to undo the work of the past century and discard everything the Labour party once stood for.</p> <p>Until the late 19th century, British party politics were not divided by class, or at least not by the class of have and have-not, bourgeois and proletarian. Tories and Whigs had their origins in the religious and dynastic conflicts of the 17th century, and their later differences were barely ideological. To Hazlitt in the 1820s, Whigs and Tories were two stagecoaches splashing each other with mud, but heading to the same destination by the same road.</p> <p>The Tories may have been the party of gentry and Church, hostile to radical bourgeois manufacturers. But Whigs were no less aristocratic than Tories, far from it. Even after Whigs, Radicals and Peelites coalesced awkwardly into the Liberal party in 1859, most of the dukes and other grandees remained within this coalition. Gladstone had at least as many great country houses to stay in as his Tory opponents.</p> <p>The historic rupture came in 1886, with home rule as the proximate cause that saw almost all the Whigs deserting, but there were deeper causes for this rift than Ireland. After 1886, if not by then, the two parties were plainly divided on class lines for the first time. Although there were patriotic working-class Tories - the \"angels in marble\" Disraeli had descried - the Conservatives and Liberals were increasingly separated by a horizontal class line.</p> <p>Some saw this and were dismayed. Lord Salisbury, who became Tory premier in 1886, had already been alarmed by the nature of the Liberal victory in the 1880 general election, which \"may be the beginning of a serious war of classes\". Then in 1894, the distinctly conservative Lord Rosebery complained to his colleague Sir William Harcourt about \"the cleavage of classes\" in politics. Rosebery became Liberal prime minister that year, albeit as a distinctly unradical Whig who was uneasy about leading a purely plebeian party. He disliked this class basis of party politics as much as Salisbury, or Blair.</p> <p>\"You are too late,\" Harcourt replied perceptively. \"The horizontal division of party was bound to come as a consequence of household suffrage. The thin end of the wedge was inserted, and the cleavage is growing day by day.\" In other words, once the mass of the people were admitted to the franchise, the day of two great political estates of the realm, divided vertically by policy rather then horizontally by class, was finished.</p> <p>Even Harcourt didn't know the half of it. He did not foresee how this cleavage was to doom the Liberals, though if he had looked harder at his own party he would have known that, although receptive to the Nonconformist lower middle class, it had been foolishly unwelcoming to the newly politicised working class.</p> <p>And so the cleavage of classes was taken a step further in February 1900 with the formation of the Labour representation committee, to become the Labour party in 1906. Then and later, its raison d'etre was often misunderstood by left and right alike. Labour had been created quite simply for class reasons - to allow proletarian politicians to become the voice of their class - rather than to espouse any doctrine. Labour was born in order to follow the principle Keir Hardie set out in 1903: \"When acting in the House of Commons, they should be neither socialists, Liberals, nor Tories, but a Labour party\".</p> <p>There was an uneasy alliance between leftwing pressure groups and a mass working-class movement: bodies like the Social Democratic Federation, the ILP and the Fabians were socialist but tiny, the unions were huge but not socialist. However, as Hardie suggested, the Labour party was defined first and foremost by class and not ideology.</p> <p>From its first substantial showing at the 1906 election to its first government in 1924 to its landslide in 1945, Labour was destined to replace the Liberals, in a way which seemed to serve the Tories' interests. This is what Blair means when he regularly laments the split in progressive politics which, as he believes, allowed the Conservatives to dominate the 20th century. It is what he wants to remedy by embracing the Lib Dems, a progressive alliance to dominate the 21st century.</p> <p>Or as he puts it in his Talk interview: \"I think it's a fantastic thing that you get people who are in business, who are middle class, and comfortably off, who will support the Labour party today, and I see nothing wrong in it at all. It was always a terrible constraint on the Labour party, to be seen as representing one class of people.\"</p> <p>No doubt the turn of phrase will make old Labour grimace, but he has a point. When he talks about removing class from politics, it has largely removed itself. For all New Labour's gratingly mawkish rhetoric and the intellectual vacuity of the \"third way,\" the prime minister has grasped one great truth: that the sort of society which produced the Labour party no longer exists.</p> <p>The poor always we have with us, but 100 years years ago \"the poor\" were most of the British people, and they aren't any more. Now the poor are a minority, to help whom the majority, and not just the rich, must pay taxes. The old industrial working class on whose behalf Labour was called into being grows smaller every year.</p> <p>Indeed, it very nearly follows from Blair's analysis that the creation of the Labour party was a terrible mistake - an opinion Blair barely disguises. He treated Labour's centenary in February rather like the 100th birthday of a senile, incontinent and unloved granny. It was time for her to fondle her telegram from the Queen, and get ready for the undertaker.</p> <p>Altogether, Blair's diagnosis that \"actually existing Labour\" has long outlived any purpose it may ever have had, and his prognosis that the future lies with class-free centrism, are coherent enough.

Whether his party was quite bargaining for this when it chose him as leader is another matter.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>David Hockney is our great artist of leisure. He focuses on the iconography of modern relaxation - showers, swimming pools, pets - just as the French impressionists painted picnics, boating parties and beer halls. </p> <p>We see the light and space of California through Hockney's paintings: a perfect eggshell-blue sky; tall, straight palms; the explosion of a diver hitting a swimming pool. Now here's the dirty, drizzling half-sunshine of a British seaside resort caught in his casual holiday snaps. In one picture a woman holds off the rain with an umbrella while her husband, in orange and black leisurewear, pushes the pram. In another an elderly couple on a white bench, their backs to us, stare at the sea and a little boy looks our way. </p> <p>These are just some casual photos Hockney took on one of his visits to Yorkshire to see friends and family; in one of them you can see the artist himself, in long white shorts, reflected in a window as he stands outdoors attempting to photograph people indoors. The pictures could be a mocking pendant to the high Californian pastorale of A Bigger Splash. A Bit of Rain, perhaps. Here's a woman with her coat over her head. There are three lads - up to no good, I'll be bound. In place of the blue pool you have the sea, grey and far too cold to dive into. Bridlington is a nice, middle-class place. There are seafront villas with blooming gardens. It's out of one of these gardens that most of the pictures appear to have been taken, as Hockney surveyed the life of the resort with a friendly eye. </p> <p>These pictures are not \"art\". The painter gave the roll of film to a friend as a souvenir; now an anonymous vendor is selling it through a Scarborough auction house. Hockney's family are said to be fuming. There is something pathetic in the urge to market an artist's ephemera, without his permission, as an \"original Hockney\". On the other hand, these are original Hockneys. He is an artist who uses the camera, and these are his photos. </p> <p>Photography has been fundamental to the way Hockney paints. His most famous paintings were made partly by copying photographs, a technique he uses to give painting a diary-like quality. He recently enthused to the New Yorker about his late friend Andy Warhol's use of photography. Warhol made portraits from Polaroids and photobooth passport shots, valuing photography as a casual picture-making machine. </p> <p>Hockney also used the camera in his classic paintings of the late 60s and early 70s to combine the monumentality of a big canvas with the emotional texture of a domestic snapshot. The paintings are private photographs turned into public art and record a time when he was moving permanently to California, missing old friends. Jack Hazan's documentary of this period, A Bigger Splash, shows a series of snaps being taken of Hockney's former lover, Peter; we see how these mementos are transformed into something weighty and lyrical as the film follows the painting of Hockney's 1971 Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures). A similar photographic process lies behind his Portrait of Mr and Mrs Clark and Percy from the same year, currently in a display of his work at Tate Britain. </p> <p>The point about Hockney is that he is more straightforwardly emotional than almost any other contemporary artist. He paints people and places with the same naturalness as when any of us take holiday snapshots of friends and family. Newspaper reports have stressed the amateurism of Hockney's Bridlington photos, as if it were humiliating. But his holiday snaps are not embarrassing at all. They are a small but authentic example of what makes him our most lovable artist. </p> <p>\u0095 David Hockney's photos can be seen between 10am and noon today at David Duggleby auctioneers in Scarborough, where they will be auctioned on Monday.

      "bodyText": "David Hockney is our great artist of leisure. He focuses on the iconography of modern relaxation - showers, swimming pools, pets - just as the French impressionists painted picnics, boating parties and beer halls. We see the light and space of California through Hockney's paintings: a perfect eggshell-blue sky; tall, straight palms; the explosion of a diver hitting a swimming pool. Now here's the dirty, drizzling half-sunshine of a British seaside resort caught in his casual holiday snaps. In one picture a woman holds off the rain with an umbrella while her husband, in orange and black leisurewear, pushes the pram. In another an elderly couple on a white bench, their backs to us, stare at the sea and a little boy looks our way. These are just some casual photos Hockney took on one of his visits to Yorkshire to see friends and family; in one of them you can see the artist himself, in long white shorts, reflected in a window as he stands outdoors attempting to photograph people indoors. The pictures could be a mocking pendant to the high Californian pastorale of A Bigger Splash. A Bit of Rain, perhaps. Here's a woman with her coat over her head. There are three lads - up to no good, I'll be bound. In place of the blue pool you have the sea, grey and far too cold to dive into. Bridlington is a nice, middle-class place. There are seafront villas with blooming gardens. It's out of one of these gardens that most of the pictures appear to have been taken, as Hockney surveyed the life of the resort with a friendly eye. These pictures are not \"art\". The painter gave the roll of film to a friend as a souvenir; now an anonymous vendor is selling it through a Scarborough auction house. Hockney's family are said to be fuming. There is something pathetic in the urge to market an artist's ephemera, without his permission, as an \"original Hockney\". On the other hand, these are original Hockneys. He is an artist who uses the camera, and these are his photos. Photography has been fundamental to the way Hockney paints. His most famous paintings were made partly by copying photographs, a technique he uses to give painting a diary-like quality. He recently enthused to the New Yorker about his late friend Andy Warhol's use of photography. Warhol made portraits from Polaroids and photobooth passport shots, valuing photography as a casual picture-making machine. Hockney also used the camera in his classic paintings of the late 60s and early 70s to combine the monumentality of a big canvas with the emotional texture of a domestic snapshot. The paintings are private photographs turned into public art and record a time when he was moving permanently to California, missing old friends. Jack Hazan's documentary of this period, A Bigger Splash, shows a series of snaps being taken of Hockney's former lover, Peter; we see how these mementos are transformed into something weighty and lyrical as the film follows the painting of Hockney's 1971 Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures). A similar photographic process lies behind his Portrait of Mr and Mrs Clark and Percy from the same year, currently in a display of his work at Tate Britain. The point about Hockney is that he is more straightforwardly emotional than almost any other contemporary artist. He paints people and places with the same naturalness as when any of us take holiday snapshots of friends and family. Newspaper reports have stressed the amateurism of Hockney's Bridlington photos, as if it were humiliating. But his holiday snaps are not embarrassing at all. They are a small but authentic example of what makes him our most lovable artist. \u0095 David Hockney's photos can be seen between 10am and noon today at David Duggleby auctioneers in Scarborough, where they will be auctioned on Monday.

With Portugal planning to raise concerns about the controversial Echelon surveillance system - a network of satellites and listening posts - the government signalled yesterday that EU member states should think carefully before allowing any discussion. Echelon, set up during the cold war, is reportedly capable of intercepting millions of telephone, fax and email messages. It has come under scrutiny by the European parliament amid allegations that it has been used to spy on European companies. Britain is worried because the issue has been presented as one in which a choice has to be made between loyalty to the US and European partners - and because intelligence and security matters are normally strictly off-limits for the EU. \"The Portuguese said they wanted a general exchange on interception,\" a British official said. \"But it would need to be a discussion that would cover the issue in the round rather than focusing on just one member state. \"There is no incompatibility between our position as an EU member state and our duty to maintain national security. Others are in the same position.\" France, angered by reports that the US used Echelon to beat the European consortium Airbus to a deal with Saudi Arabia, is expected to be quick to grasp the veiled threat. Britain declared formally last month that any interception of communications carried out by the GCHQ eavesdropping centre was covered by strict legal guidelines, ministerial control and parliamentary oversight. Fresh efforts are being made to convince sceptics that interception officially justified by the need to \"safeguard the nation's economic well-being\" does not involve British companies gaining commercial advantage. Only threats to the supply of energy, commodities and raw materials or attempts to manipulate or undermine the financial markets would justify legal interception, the government says. Portugal, the current holder of the EU's rotating presidency, announced that it would consider the issue at a meeting of interior ministers next month. The 626-member parliament will make the unusual move next week of setting up its own ad hoc committee of inquiry, and hold two plenary debates on Echelon in May. James Woolsey, a former head of the CIA, admitted recently that the US does secretly collect information on European companies. But he insisted that it only targeted firms which violated United Nations sanctions or offered bribes to gain business. Britain has never denied helping the US operate Echelon satellites and listening posts along with Canada, Australia and New Zealand in an intelligence-sharing pact that dates back to the early days of the cold war.",

Under the leadership of Costas Simitis, Pasok, the Socialist party, has buried the left, along with generous patronage and social spending; under Costas Karamanlis, leader of New Democracy, the conservatives have moved centre stage, even courting labour organisations which were once the backbone of Pasok's support.</p> <p>In the confusion of overlapping agendas the election, called five months early, has been dominated by the sniping between leaders stealing one another's policies.</p> <p>\"People here have realised that in a united Europe it doesn't make a great difference who wins,\" says Nikos Dimou, author of the best selling The Misfortune to be Greek.</p> <p>\"We are a country that is totally dependent on the EU and, as such, there is very little the national government can do.

      "bodyText": "At the end of one of the longest general election campaigns in history, Greeks will be faced with a simple choice at the polls tomorrow: re-elect Pasok, which has brought peace with Turkey, or elect the conservative New Democrats, who take a more hawkish stance on relations with Athens's traditional foe. Analysts say it is the only real difference between the two main parties. Under the leadership of Costas Simitis, Pasok, the Socialist party, has buried the left, along with generous patronage and social spending; under Costas Karamanlis, leader of New Democracy, the conservatives have moved centre stage, even courting labour organisations which were once the backbone of Pasok's support. In the confusion of overlapping agendas the election, called five months early, has been dominated by the sniping between leaders stealing one another's policies. \"People here have realised that in a united Europe it doesn't make a great difference who wins,\" says Nikos Dimou, author of the best selling The Misfortune to be Greek. \"We are a country that is totally dependent on the EU and, as such, there is very little the national government can do. Greeks are more interested in the Athens stock exchange: it's the only thing left that seems to get their blood boiling.\" But with 26 parties competing it will be the closest contest since the restoration of democracy after the collapse of the Colonels' regime in 1974. Up to 13% of the 8.9m electors are still undecided and the polls show the two main contenders neck and neck. Both big parties were flying in voters from around the globe last night, including migrant workers in Germany and Greeks studying in Britain.",

Asking why Mr Radebe and the ANC had made no attempt to establish the facts, it said: \"In the absence of a plausible answer, we must assume that the allegation was made with malicious intent.\"</p> <p>An ANC statement on Thursday night said: \"We took an oath before the commission and therefore stand by our written submission.\"</p>",

Philip van Niekerk, editor of the Mail &amp; Guardian - a sister publication of the Guardian - asked the human rights commission to launch an inquiry into what he termed a \"lie\" told to it by the minister of public enterprises, Jeff Radebe. Mr Radebe delivered a written submission to the commission this week on behalf of the ANC, claiming that Mr Van Niekerk had personally written an attack on the president, Thabo Mbeki, and published it under the name of a black woman reporter to avoid the accusation that he was a racist. Yesterday the reporter in question, Lizeka Mda - now executive editor of one of the country's biggest daily newspapers, the Star - said in a front page article that the allegation was entirely untrue, that the minister had made no attempt to confirm it with her, and that it was the worst possible insult to her integrity. Ms Mda dismissed Mr Radebe as less than a \"colourless piece of chewing gum stuck to the underside of the dinner table\", and said: \"What gives one a sinking feeling is that as president of the ANC, Mbeki wrote, or gave his express approval to, that nonsensical document.\" A statement issued by the Mail &amp; Guardian on behalf of the editor, management and staff described Mr Radebe's accusation as \"in every respect, a gross, defamatory lie\". Demanding that the ANC and minister withdraw it and issue \"an unconditional retraction and full apology\", the statement said: \"It does not become a proud political party, or, for that matter, a minister of state, to lie publicly and with defamatory intent and result.\" It said the staff stood by Mr Van Niekerk, \"an editor of rare integrity and courage.\" Mr Van Niekerk, acting on legal advice, made a formal application to the commission for an inquiry into Mr Radebe's testimony. Specific provision is made in the enabling legislation for such an inquiry if it is suspected that a witness has made allegations with reckless disregard for the truth: a criminal offence punishable by up to six months' imprisonment. Other newspapers were quick to rally to the support of the Mail &amp; Guardian. Business Day said in an editorial, headed \"Higher order of crassness\", that the ANC's submission was \"idiocy,\" and that its characterisation of the South African press was an \"offensive\" stereotype. It said that the portrayal of all criticism as racist \"looks like an attempt to intimidate the media into halting any criticism of government and, particularly, the president\". Another Johannesburg newspaper, the Citizen, demanded that the minister \"retract and apologise\" for the charge. Asking why Mr Radebe and the ANC had made no attempt to establish the facts, it said: \"In the absence of a plausible answer, we must assume that the allegation was made with malicious intent.\" An ANC statement on Thursday night said: \"We took an oath before the commission and therefore stand by our written submission.\"",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>In 1981 Peter Nichols won the London Evening Standard best play of the year award for Passion Play, his ingenious and revelatory account of modern mores. It was the fourth time he had won the award - a record - and his position as one of Britain's leading playwrights was assured. But there was no lachrymose and gracious acceptance speech. Instead, Nichols chose to launch into a splenetic rant about members of the cast whose pay demands had ensured the play's short run at the RSC didn't transfer to a commercial west end theatre. How sick he was of accepting awards for plays that had already closed, he fulminated. </p> <p>It sounds par for the course for a man who is easy to cast as the embittered lost genius of the London stage. Ever since the early 80s, Nichols has found it increasingly difficult to get his plays staged, and now says he doesn't read the newspapers, \"not only because they might say something bad about me, but even worse, they might say something good about someone else\". His last work to be seen, Blue Murder, was a play about putting on a play and was itself put on in a space called Quakers Friars above the register office in Bristol. As Nichols put it to a friend, \"every year at awards ceremonies it seems that my seat gets nearer to the lavatories\". </p> <p>However, Passion Play is due to be restaged this month. Where Pinter fractured and reversed time in Betrayal, his study of infidelity, Nichols's radical approach to the same subject had already blazed a trail in slowing time down. To communicate to the audience the inner thoughts and motivations of the troubled married couple he used a parallel pair of actors - it was a stunning, and at the time groundbreaking, coup de th\u00e9tre. </p> <p>Nichols, who has never been short of friends and admirers in the industry, is hoping the Passion Play revival will spark a reassessment of his work. \"He is such a theatre man,\" says Stephen Sondheim, who has known him for 30 years. \"Peter was an actor when he started, as were so many of the best playwrights in history. He really knows the stage.\" </p> <p>Michael Frayn is also an admirer. \"I have been greatly influenced by his work. One of the wonderful things about him as a writer is that he is very dangerous. He doesn't have any of the techniques of self censorship and self preservation that other writers develop. Sometimes he says terrible things that no one else would say that absolutely strike home to one's heart, and sometimes he says things which are embarrassing. But that is part of being a dangerous writer.\" </p> <p>The American theatre producer Hal Prince is equally impressed but thinks that Nichols has not played the game: \"Maybe he has not been as pragmatic as he might have been. He is one of the best contemporary playwrights your country has produced. I wish he had previously just swallowed some of the guff and saved his generally accurate opinions for himself. There is a certain lunatic courage in how quick he is to express what he feels, and while Peter never sets out to hurt people's feelings, he has never learned not to say what he thinks.\" </p> <p>So what is Nichols's best guess as to why, when he has been more productive than ever, only two new works have been staged in the past 13 years? \"I've asked that question in private and in public and if I knew the answer I might be a happier person,\" he says. In 1993 he published a long poem in the Independent, \"The Rime Of The Ancient Dramatist\", about him accosting the then director of the National Theatre Richard Eyre and haranguing him about his neglect. \"This is the fourth play of mine/ You've found your reasons to decline\", etc etc. </p> <p>\"I suppose it just comes down to the fact that they don't like my stuff,\" he says. \"When young playwrights ask for advice I always say 'get a friend at court'. Michael Grandage, who is directing Passion Play, is friendly to my stuff, therefore it goes on. In 1990 Richard Eyre and everyone else loved a play of mine called Euphoria that was due to go on at the National. But as soon as the director, Mike Ockrent, dropped out for a film job, the play was stranded. You have to remember that theatres are run by directors.\" </p> <p>This theory of directorial discrimination is given added credence in that critics have been generally enthusiastic about his work. \"As Edith Evans said about the Russians when people talked about Stalin's tyranny,\" explains Nichols, \"they've always been very nice to me. But I am less concerned about my critical reputation and more with just getting the plays on. I want to see how they work with an audience.\" </p> <p>Just how difficult this simple aim has become is starkly illustrated by Nichols's recent calculation that while 41 of his works including adaptations, films and television have been realised, there are now another 40 that have been rejected. These, all lined up in neat box files in the top floor office he has in his Belsize Park home, have a strange ongoing half life as continuing works in progress. He has turned scripts that were not filmed into novels that have not been published. Unseen novels have become plays that have not been staged. \"When you think of all the wasted creativity and the wasted time it is appalling,\" he says. </p> <p>Why Nichols fell so sharply out of vogue is a complicated tale. Undoubtedly, the transformation of the 70s generation of political playwrights into the 80s establishment played a part, and Nichols's own fractious relationship with the theatre couldn't have helped. But perhaps more importantly there was a strong perception that he had fallen into the classic trap set for successful writers. A fellow playwright says, \"You can see it in David Mercer and John Osborne, and perhaps even in Harold Pinter. As you become successful you move away from your class and your subject matter. Your field of vision gets narrower and narrower and in the end your work can become arid and lack the density of earlier pieces.\" Nichols doesn't agree. \"Alan Bennett doesn't have any trouble getting his plays on. I am an autobiographical writer. Just because I am a playwright doesn't mean I don't have a life. If I thought that was the problem don't you think I would have done something to change it?\" </p> <p>The writer Robert Heller has been a long-time friend and thinks Nichols has remained pretty much the same throughout the vicissitudes of his career. \"He's melancholic, feels under-appreciated and has a wicked sense of humour,\" says Heller. \"It always seemed a bit absurd to me that he thought he was in competition with other writers. The real competition is with yourself and bugger the others. But maybe he thinks that in comparison to the potential Peter Nichols, the real Peter Nichols has not done as well as he should have done. But he has done bloody well. He might not be in the O'Neill school when history looks back, but he will certainly be at the Rattigan level. And I think Rattigan is very good.\" </p> <p>The painter Patrick Hughes is another old friend. \"He seems to have made that transition from angry young man to acerbic old man without passing through the gentle uplands of middle age. But he would never be as rude to people as his friend John Osborne was. He is still hilarious, and sort of profound company. He knows things ebb and flow. Particularly in the youth culture, people get passed over and then they get revived. There are very few who are always on the inside track.\" </p> <p>Peter Nichols was born in Bristol in 1927, the first child of Richard and Violet Nichols. He has one brother, Geoffrey, five years younger than him. When asked whether he had a happy childhood he replies, \"who can say\". His father was a \"representative in dry saltery\" for the Cooperative Society - \"he hated being called a grocery salesman\" - and they had a car which, in the 1920s, was \"pretty classy\". </p> <p>\"Essentially, it was a Victorian home,\" says Nichols. \"My father was a Victorian and was non gambling, non smoking and non drinking. I think my grandfather drank and my father used to resent having to fetch his beer when a boy. If any of my plays are really autobiographical then Forget-me-not-Lane - about how we all end up like our parents - is about what tensions there were in that house. But they were extremely decent, self-sacrificing parents who paid for me and my brother to go to grammar school, and I repaid them by total laziness and indifference to learning. I never got a prize or was praised in any way for writing while there.\" </p> <p>Nichols said he didn't know what university was when he left school. \"I couldn't care less. I wanted to go to Hollywood. I was completely stage-struck. The highlights of my year were the Christmas pantomime and the summer circus. In between I would play with my toy circus and toy pantomime. And I'd go to the cinema and occasionally the theatre and variety shows.\" </p> <p>His route in to this theatrical world was unexpected. He was conscripted into the Royal Air Force just as the war was ending. After being turned down by the entertainment corps in India he was accepted in Singapore. \"And that's when my education really began.\" He was in the same troupe as Kenneth Williams, Stanley Baxter and John Schlesinger, who was a conjurer at the time. The experience was turned into his 1977 hit musical and film Privates On Parade, and was strangely echoed later in the sit-com It Ain't Half Hot Mum. </p> <p>More immediately, it provided a launch pad into the world of legit theatre. When demobbed in 1951 he enrolled at the Bristol Old Vic theatre school and two years later began life as a professional actor. He says he did some pretty good work but didn't get enough jobs. His biggest success was playing Count Dracula in fortnightly rep in Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen. \"My favourite notice said, 'Count Dracula is no longer so fearsome'. But I knew in my heart that acting wasn't the right thing for me.\" </p> <p>His father had given him \u00a3500, which he spent trying to be an actor and writer. He wrote some plays but didn't submit them because he didn't feel they were good enough. Friends advised him to become a teacher because the long holidays would give him time to write. He got a place in a teacher training college in Hertfordshire and in 1959 made two ambitious new year resolutions; that he would get a play performed and that he would get married. At the time he had no girlfriend and no play. </p> <p>The play issue was solved when he won a BBC playwriting competition - despite never having seen a television play - for Walk On The Grass, a family comedy. Soon after, Granada screened a second work, Promenade, about a group of young people on a weekend in Brighton. The wife issue was solved after his lung collapsed and he was hospitalised in Bristol. He received a letter from a childhood friend, Thelma Reed, who was also a teacher. She visited him and a few months later, on December 28 1959, they were married. </p> <p>\"I was in hospital when the second television play went on. Granada said they would give me a monitor to watch it in a private ward but the matron wouldn't allow that so I had to see it on a ward television set. Unfortunately there was a cup final on the other station and so I forced everyone to watch this incredibly arty play, which was described as 'pastel-coloured Fellini', so it was a bit awkward.\" </p> <p> With his career now taking off they both gave up teaching and moved to Devon. Their first daughter, Abigail, was born soon afterwards. The Nichols had three further children in the next five years. Their daughter Louise is an IT coordinator at a primary school in London, Daniel works with redundant coal miners in South Wales and has written a musical which is being staged in Cardiff shortly, and Catherine is a solicitor in Darlington. They have five grandchildren. </p> <p>Abigail was born severely brain-damaged and went into hospital on a full-time basis when she was three. She died aged 10. Had they anticipated such a short life expectancy? \"Well, we always hoped so. There was nothing we could do for her. Abigail went into hospital just after our third child was born and stayed there the rest of her life. She was always physically very beautiful. She had lovely eyes and her features were very fine. I used to say why me? Why us? But then I thought, why not us?\" </p> <p>Nichols was finding it increasingly difficult to earn a living as a television playwright. Fellow playwright and old Bristol friend Charles Wood lent the couple money, as did Nichols's agent, Peggy Ramsey. \"It was all getting a bit of a struggle and then John Boorman, who was working in the features section in BBC Bristol, asked me if I'd like to write this caper film like A Hard Day's Night for the pop band the Dave Clark 5. I said not really, because it looked pretty much like rubbish. 'What would we get out of it?' I asked. John said he would get a Hollywood contract and I'd get the money to write my stage play. And he was right.\" </p> <p>The result was A Day In The Death Of Joe Egg, a tragi-comedy about a couple with a severely handicapped child. Michael Blakemore directed it at the Citizens' Theatre in Glasgow after it had been turned down by all the London west end managers. \"Peter and I had been very good friends,\" says Blakemore. \"The Nichols stayed at our flat when they were in London and they were with us when the doctor told them how severe Abigail's brain damage was. It was almost a resignation issue for me when it became very contentious with the theatre board. A lot of people thought it was sick comedy but it was a study in how people cope with this kind of disaster. The Nichols coped through humour. It was an awful time for them and it is, of course, the great irony of his life that this catastrophe was the thing that made his name and his fortune.\" </p> <p>Nichols has recently seen in the British Library the Lord Chamberlain's case papers - in 1967 he was stage censor - relating to Joe Egg. \"The papers say, 'it is a play about an over-sexed schoolteacher in Bristol with a handicapped child written, I suspect, by an over-sexed schoolteacher in Bristol with a handicapped child'.\" Lines such as \"legs thrashing about\" had to be cut, but more seriously, it was thought the play would offend the parents of handicapped children if the child was depicted. It was seriously suggested that a ventriloquist's dummy was used instead of a child. </p> <p>Nichols won this battle and the play received good reviews, particularly from the Guardian. \"All the London crowd flew up to see it,\" Nichols says, \"and I got a phone call from Peggy Ramsey saying Albert Finney wants to take it as it is, Bernard Delfont wants to tour it first, and Kenneth Tynan wants it for the National Theatre. The choice was mine. It was one of those Cinderella things.\" </p> <p>Michael Blakemore says he was very lucky to find Peter and Peter probably was lucky to find him. \"It was the most exciting period of our lives. We were both interested in the same things. We loved the huge vitality, discipline and lack of pretensions of the very best commercial work we had seen as children, the very best of Hollywood; movies like Casablanca, the Astaire and Rogers films. Peter also loved music hall and the skills of the great comedians.\" They were both interested in applying these techniques to more serious subjects. \"We wanted this constant collision where the style was comic but the content was not. That collision causes a very exciting frisson in the theatre.\" </p> <p>Joe Egg went on to Broadway, became a film starring Alan Bates and Janet Suzman. It began an astonishing run of success for Nichols. Ken Tynan asked for a play for the National Theatre and The National Health went on to win the 1969 Evening Standard best play award. Forget-me-not Lane was staged at Greenwich in 1971. Then there was a trio of works for the RSC; the camp concert party romp Privates On Parade, Passion Play, and Poppy, in which he subverted Britain's only true contribution to world theatre, the pantomime, by setting his acute critique of empire in the opium wars. Despite all the critical success Nichols was still dissatisfied with the theatre, and after Poppy won best musical in 1982 he walked away. </p> <p>\"It's been said that I am famously difficult to work with but I had one problem with Terry Hands, who directed Poppy, and that was an entirely artistic row, nothing else.\" Hands described him as \"a wayward, curiously self-destructive genius\". Nichols says, \"we had a genuine disagreement and I was unwise enough to make it public. After that I got pissed off with the theatre. It was such a lot of pain and misery and the rewards were not so great. Joe Egg made us a great deal of money but by the standards of someone like a director it is nothing. So I left Camden Town and went off to write novels in the middle of Shropshire.\" </p> <p>Nichols says that the money from Joe Egg stopped being, \"anything to write home about 10 years ago. But luckily, when we were doing well, my accountant suggested a pension. We never thought things would get so bad that I couldn't earn a living through writing but they did, and for the last 10 years or so we have lived off the pension, so it was a very shrewd decision.\" </p> <p>Three years after they moved to Shropshire, John Osborne became a neighbour and, almost inevitably, the two had a row just before Nichols moved back to London. \"But as Mark Twain said when receiving the L\u00e9gion d'honneur, with John 'that is an honour few escape'.\" The argument was over who would pay a wine bill. The next day Osborne sent his gardener to Nichols with a note, \"full of invective and in which the word 'commonness' was used\". The two didn't speak again before Osborne died. </p> <p>\"I was very fond of John, and we have made peace with his wife Helen now,\" says Nichols. He moved back to London, he says, because \"I just got fed up looking at sheep and decided I was a city person. I was a playwright. That's what I did. It wasn't a feeling of obligation. People were hardly making me do it, everything I wrote was being turned down.\" His last new play to make it to London was A Piece Of My Mind, in 1987. It was about a man who retired to the country to write a novel, failed and turned it into a play. This time the reviewers did turn on Nichols - \"another piece of advice I would give young writers is not to have a character called The Critic who lives in a toilet in your play\". </p> <p>Apart from Blue Murder, in Bristol, no new plays have been seen since, although a radio version of So Long Life, an update of his family plays of the 60s, written three years ago, will be broadcast on Radio 4 later this month. He is also in early discussions with an actor and director about staging another three-year-old play, Pursued By A Bear, a Pirandellian piece featuring Sherlock Holmes. But first comes Passion Play. </p> <p>\"Sam Mendes asked me to come up with a few suggestions for plays, of which Passion Play was one, and it also happened to be on the Donmar's wish list,\" says director Michael Grandage. \"The great thing about it is that it must have been in his head in the late 70s, and 20 years later the language - with the exception of them drinking Cinzano Bianco - has not dated at all. It doesn't feel like a period piece. His dialogue is brilliant and his command of structure is almost faultless. He stood for the 'well made play', which is a terrible phrase, but he took it that step further in terms of subject matter. Nichols plays are great to study at drama school and it would be fantastic if some of the others could be revived again. He was a very influential writer.\" </p> <p>Michael Frayn agrees. \"One of the things that influenced me was when he said you have to take note of the existence of the audience. The audience has a tremendous affect on the course of a performance. I have very much taken the idea that the audience is there and you have to do something about them.\" </p> <p>But the problems of getting an audience in the first place have taken their toll. \"I did get very depressed about this business of the plays not being staged,\" says Nichols. \"Therapy didn't do too much for me, but the anti-depressants worked very well, they took away the pain of depression. I was surprised that the therapist didn't want to read my work. She could have said that it was completely untrustworthy or whatever, but I'm not someone who has been dammed up about things, I've talked about myself to audiences for 40 years. </p> <p>\"I haven't been depressed since then but of course I am fed up that my plays aren't staged. But that comes out more as anger than depression. I don't drive it inwards, I drive it outwards, which is much healthier\". </p> <p>Nichols jokes that coming from Bristol he would know what to do if things really get too much. \"The Clifton suspension bridge is such a temptation. As a boy I used to think about it a lot. Just jumping off. I think all Bristolians carry that around in their head; 'there's always the bridge. A single ticket to Bristol please'.\" </p> <p>While he is happy to acknowledge the autobiographical elements in his work he warns that it goes only so far. \"Evelyn Waugh, who was much more autobiographical than people think, said that 'I am not I, he is not he, and they are not they'. I think that sums it up very well. But I don't care that people lumber me with being autobiographical, as long as other people don't get offended by it. My brother keeps saying, 'can't you disguise it a little bit more' but the actual life is only a starting point. The couple in Joe Egg weren't us. I couldn't have started the play until I pushed myself into the background.\" In fact, Nichols has written a very entertaining autobiography, Feeling You're Behind, that took him up to 1967, and has kept a diary for most of his life. It is currently being prepared for publication. </p> <p>But mostly he keeps with the plays. Stephen Sondheim says he has been a victim of what has happened to non-musical theatre. \"It is in dire straits in America where virtually all new plays are off Broadway. There is no off Broadway in the UK, only fringe theatres like the Donmar, which put on limited runs. So new plays, even by established playwrights, don't have the market they used to. I've seen Peter in his bitter stage and his accepting stage, but what is wonderful is that he keeps on writing. He does a great deal of complaining but always goes back to the typewriter. That maybe is the plight of many writers these days.\" </p> <p>\"People do go out of vogue,\" says Michael Frayn. \"It is still extremely painful for Peter but when Joe Egg was revived a few years ago in a terrific production [at the King's Head, Islington] it was wonderful and did speak to a new generation. I'm sure it will be revived at the National sooner or later.\" </p> <p>In the meantime, Nichols keeps working and at 72 years of age he keeps dreaming. \"If I won the lottery I know exactly what I would do,\" he laughs. \"I would put myself in the Alan Ayckbourn or Andrew Lloyd Webber position and buy my own theatre. I would hire a company and have them do my plays over and over and over again, not caring if people came or not. I would love to do that. It would be wonderful to see the un-produced plays on a stage.\" </p> <p><strong>Life at a glance: Peter Nichols </strong></p> <p><strong>Born: </strong> July 31 1927, Bristol. </p> <p><strong> Married:</strong> 1959 Thelma Reed (one son, three daughters, Abigail deceased). </p> <p><strong> Education:</strong> Bristol Grammar School; Bristol Old Vic theatre school 1951-53; Trent Park Teachers College 1958-60. </p> <p><strong> Occupations:</strong> Royal Air Force 1945-49; actor 1953-58; teacher 1958-60. </p> <p><strong> Some television plays: </strong> Walk On The Grass 1959; Promenade 1960; Hearts and Flowers 1970. </p> <p><strong> Some films: </strong> Catch Us If You Can 1965;<strong> </strong> Georgy Girl 1967; Joe Egg 1971; Privates on Parade1983. </p> <p><strong> Some Plays: </strong> A Day In The Death Of Joe Egg 1967; The National Health 1969; Forget-me-not Lane 1971; Chez Nous 1973; The Freeway 1974; Privates On Parade 1977; Passion Play 1980; Poppy 1982; Blue Murder 1995. </p> <p><strong> Autobiography: </strong> Feeling You're Behind 1984. </p> <p>\u0095 Passion Play is at the Donmar Warehouse from 13 April-10 June.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In 1981 Peter Nichols won the London Evening Standard best play of the year award for Passion Play, his ingenious and revelatory account of modern mores. It was the fourth time he had won the award - a record - and his position as one of Britain's leading playwrights was assured. But there was no lachrymose and gracious acceptance speech. Instead, Nichols chose to launch into a splenetic rant about members of the cast whose pay demands had ensured the play's short run at the RSC didn't transfer to a commercial west end theatre. How sick he was of accepting awards for plays that had already closed, he fulminated. It sounds par for the course for a man who is easy to cast as the embittered lost genius of the London stage. Ever since the early 80s, Nichols has found it increasingly difficult to get his plays staged, and now says he doesn't read the newspapers, \"not only because they might say something bad about me, but even worse, they might say something good about someone else\". His last work to be seen, Blue Murder, was a play about putting on a play and was itself put on in a space called Quakers Friars above the register office in Bristol. As Nichols put it to a friend, \"every year at awards ceremonies it seems that my seat gets nearer to the lavatories\". However, Passion Play is due to be restaged this month. Where Pinter fractured and reversed time in Betrayal, his study of infidelity, Nichols's radical approach to the same subject had already blazed a trail in slowing time down. To communicate to the audience the inner thoughts and motivations of the troubled married couple he used a parallel pair of actors - it was a stunning, and at the time groundbreaking, coup de th\u00e9tre. Nichols, who has never been short of friends and admirers in the industry, is hoping the Passion Play revival will spark a reassessment of his work. \"He is such a theatre man,\" says Stephen Sondheim, who has known him for 30 years. \"Peter was an actor when he started, as were so many of the best playwrights in history. He really knows the stage.\" Michael Frayn is also an admirer. \"I have been greatly influenced by his work. One of the wonderful things about him as a writer is that he is very dangerous. He doesn't have any of the techniques of self censorship and self preservation that other writers develop. Sometimes he says terrible things that no one else would say that absolutely strike home to one's heart, and sometimes he says things which are embarrassing. But that is part of being a dangerous writer.\" The American theatre producer Hal Prince is equally impressed but thinks that Nichols has not played the game: \"Maybe he has not been as pragmatic as he might have been. He is one of the best contemporary playwrights your country has produced. I wish he had previously just swallowed some of the guff and saved his generally accurate opinions for himself. There is a certain lunatic courage in how quick he is to express what he feels, and while Peter never sets out to hurt people's feelings, he has never learned not to say what he thinks.\" So what is Nichols's best guess as to why, when he has been more productive than ever, only two new works have been staged in the past 13 years? \"I've asked that question in private and in public and if I knew the answer I might be a happier person,\" he says. In 1993 he published a long poem in the Independent, \"The Rime Of The Ancient Dramatist\", about him accosting the then director of the National Theatre Richard Eyre and haranguing him about his neglect. \"This is the fourth play of mine/ You've found your reasons to decline\", etc etc. \"I suppose it just comes down to the fact that they don't like my stuff,\" he says. \"When young playwrights ask for advice I always say 'get a friend at court'. Michael Grandage, who is directing Passion Play, is friendly to my stuff, therefore it goes on. In 1990 Richard Eyre and everyone else loved a play of mine called Euphoria that was due to go on at the National. But as soon as the director, Mike Ockrent, dropped out for a film job, the play was stranded. You have to remember that theatres are run by directors.\" This theory of directorial discrimination is given added credence in that critics have been generally enthusiastic about his work. \"As Edith Evans said about the Russians when people talked about Stalin's tyranny,\" explains Nichols, \"they've always been very nice to me. But I am less concerned about my critical reputation and more with just getting the plays on. I want to see how they work with an audience.\" Just how difficult this simple aim has become is starkly illustrated by Nichols's recent calculation that while 41 of his works including adaptations, films and television have been realised, there are now another 40 that have been rejected. These, all lined up in neat box files in the top floor office he has in his Belsize Park home, have a strange ongoing half life as continuing works in progress. He has turned scripts that were not filmed into novels that have not been published. Unseen novels have become plays that have not been staged. \"When you think of all the wasted creativity and the wasted time it is appalling,\" he says. Why Nichols fell so sharply out of vogue is a complicated tale. Undoubtedly, the transformation of the 70s generation of political playwrights into the 80s establishment played a part, and Nichols's own fractious relationship with the theatre couldn't have helped. But perhaps more importantly there was a strong perception that he had fallen into the classic trap set for successful writers. A fellow playwright says, \"You can see it in David Mercer and John Osborne, and perhaps even in Harold Pinter. As you become successful you move away from your class and your subject matter. Your field of vision gets narrower and narrower and in the end your work can become arid and lack the density of earlier pieces.\" Nichols doesn't agree. \"Alan Bennett doesn't have any trouble getting his plays on. I am an autobiographical writer. Just because I am a playwright doesn't mean I don't have a life. If I thought that was the problem don't you think I would have done something to change it?\" The writer Robert Heller has been a long-time friend and thinks Nichols has remained pretty much the same throughout the vicissitudes of his career. \"He's melancholic, feels under-appreciated and has a wicked sense of humour,\" says Heller. \"It always seemed a bit absurd to me that he thought he was in competition with other writers. The real competition is with yourself and bugger the others. But maybe he thinks that in comparison to the potential Peter Nichols, the real Peter Nichols has not done as well as he should have done. But he has done bloody well. He might not be in the O'Neill school when history looks back, but he will certainly be at the Rattigan level. And I think Rattigan is very good.\" The painter Patrick Hughes is another old friend. \"He seems to have made that transition from angry young man to acerbic old man without passing through the gentle uplands of middle age. But he would never be as rude to people as his friend John Osborne was. He is still hilarious, and sort of profound company. He knows things ebb and flow. Particularly in the youth culture, people get passed over and then they get revived. There are very few who are always on the inside track.\" Peter Nichols was born in Bristol in 1927, the first child of Richard and Violet Nichols. He has one brother, Geoffrey, five years younger than him. When asked whether he had a happy childhood he replies, \"who can say\". His father was a \"representative in dry saltery\" for the Cooperative Society - \"he hated being called a grocery salesman\" - and they had a car which, in the 1920s, was \"pretty classy\". \"Essentially, it was a Victorian home,\" says Nichols. \"My father was a Victorian and was non gambling, non smoking and non drinking. I think my grandfather drank and my father used to resent having to fetch his beer when a boy. If any of my plays are really autobiographical then Forget-me-not-Lane - about how we all end up like our parents - is about what tensions there were in that house. But they were extremely decent, self-sacrificing parents who paid for me and my brother to go to grammar school, and I repaid them by total laziness and indifference to learning. I never got a prize or was praised in any way for writing while there.\" Nichols said he didn't know what university was when he left school. \"I couldn't care less. I wanted to go to Hollywood. I was completely stage-struck. The highlights of my year were the Christmas pantomime and the summer circus. In between I would play with my toy circus and toy pantomime. And I'd go to the cinema and occasionally the theatre and variety shows.\" His route in to this theatrical world was unexpected. He was conscripted into the Royal Air Force just as the war was ending. After being turned down by the entertainment corps in India he was accepted in Singapore. \"And that's when my education really began.\" He was in the same troupe as Kenneth Williams, Stanley Baxter and John Schlesinger, who was a conjurer at the time. The experience was turned into his 1977 hit musical and film Privates On Parade, and was strangely echoed later in the sit-com It Ain't Half Hot Mum. More immediately, it provided a launch pad into the world of legit theatre. When demobbed in 1951 he enrolled at the Bristol Old Vic theatre school and two years later began life as a professional actor. He says he did some pretty good work but didn't get enough jobs. His biggest success was playing Count Dracula in fortnightly rep in Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen. \"My favourite notice said, 'Count Dracula is no longer so fearsome'. But I knew in my heart that acting wasn't the right thing for me.\" His father had given him \u00a3500, which he spent trying to be an actor and writer. He wrote some plays but didn't submit them because he didn't feel they were good enough. Friends advised him to become a teacher because the long holidays would give him time to write. He got a place in a teacher training college in Hertfordshire and in 1959 made two ambitious new year resolutions; that he would get a play performed and that he would get married. At the time he had no girlfriend and no play. The play issue was solved when he won a BBC playwriting competition - despite never having seen a television play - for Walk On The Grass, a family comedy. Soon after, Granada screened a second work, Promenade, about a group of young people on a weekend in Brighton. The wife issue was solved after his lung collapsed and he was hospitalised in Bristol. He received a letter from a childhood friend, Thelma Reed, who was also a teacher. She visited him and a few months later, on December 28 1959, they were married. \"I was in hospital when the second television play went on.

Unfortunately there was a cup final on the other station and so I forced everyone to watch this incredibly arty play, which was described as 'pastel-coloured Fellini', so it was a bit awkward.\" With his career now taking off they both gave up teaching and moved to Devon. Their first daughter, Abigail, was born soon afterwards. The Nichols had three further children in the next five years. Their daughter Louise is an IT coordinator at a primary school in London, Daniel works with redundant coal miners in South Wales and has written a musical which is being staged in Cardiff shortly, and Catherine is a solicitor in Darlington.

He moved back to London, he says, because \"I just got fed up looking at sheep and decided I was a city person. I was a playwright. That's what I did. It wasn't a feeling of obligation. People were hardly making me do it, everything I wrote was being turned down.\" His last new play to make it to London was A Piece Of My Mind, in 1987. It was about a man who retired to the country to write a novel, failed and turned it into a play. This time the reviewers did turn on Nichols - \"another piece of advice I would give young writers is not to have a character called The Critic who lives in a toilet in your play\". Apart from Blue Murder, in Bristol, no new plays have been seen since, although a radio version of So Long Life, an update of his family plays of the 60s, written three years ago, will be broadcast on Radio 4 later this month. He is also in early discussions with an actor and director about staging another three-year-old play, Pursued By A Bear, a Pirandellian piece featuring Sherlock Holmes. But first comes Passion Play. \"Sam Mendes asked me to come up with a few suggestions for plays, of which Passion Play was one, and it also happened to be on the Donmar's wish list,\" says director Michael Grandage. \"The great thing about it is that it must have been in his head in the late 70s, and 20 years later the language - with the exception of them drinking Cinzano Bianco - has not dated at all. It doesn't feel like a period piece. His dialogue is brilliant and his command of structure is almost faultless. He stood for the 'well made play', which is a terrible phrase, but he took it that step further in terms of subject matter. Nichols plays are great to study at drama school and it would be fantastic if some of the others could be revived again. He was a very influential writer.\" Michael Frayn agrees. \"One of the things that influenced me was when he said you have to take note of the existence of the audience. The audience has a tremendous affect on the course of a performance. I have very much taken the idea that the audience is there and you have to do something about them.\" But the problems of getting an audience in the first place have taken their toll. \"I did get very depressed about this business of the plays not being staged,\" says Nichols. \"Therapy didn't do too much for me, but the anti-depressants worked very well, they took away the pain of depression. I was surprised that the therapist didn't want to read my work. She could have said that it was completely untrustworthy or whatever, but I'm not someone who has been dammed up about things, I've talked about myself to audiences for 40 years. \"I haven't been depressed since then but of course I am fed up that my plays aren't staged. But that comes out more as anger than depression. I don't drive it inwards, I drive it outwards, which is much healthier\". Nichols jokes that coming from Bristol he would know what to do if things really get too much. \"The Clifton suspension bridge is such a temptation. As a boy I used to think about it a lot. Just jumping off. I think all Bristolians carry that around in their head; 'there's always the bridge. A single ticket to Bristol please'.\" While he is happy to acknowledge the autobiographical elements in his work he warns that it goes only so far. \"Evelyn Waugh, who was much more autobiographical than people think, said that 'I am not I, he is not he, and they are not they'. I think that sums it up very well. But I don't care that people lumber me with being autobiographical, as long as other people don't get offended by it. My brother keeps saying, 'can't you disguise it a little bit more' but the actual life is only a starting point. The couple in Joe Egg weren't us. I couldn't have started the play until I pushed myself into the background.\" In fact, Nichols has written a very entertaining autobiography, Feeling You're Behind, that took him up to 1967, and has kept a diary for most of his life. It is currently being prepared for publication. But mostly he keeps with the plays. Stephen Sondheim says he has been a victim of what has happened to non-musical theatre. \"It is in dire straits in America where virtually all new plays are off Broadway. There is no off Broadway in the UK, only fringe theatres like the Donmar, which put on limited runs. So new plays, even by established playwrights, don't have the market they used to. I've seen Peter in his bitter stage and his accepting stage, but what is wonderful is that he keeps on writing. He does a great deal of complaining but always goes back to the typewriter. That maybe is the plight of many writers these days.\" \"People do go out of vogue,\" says Michael Frayn. \"It is still extremely painful for Peter but when Joe Egg was revived a few years ago in a terrific production [at the King's Head, Islington] it was wonderful and did speak to a new generation. I'm sure it will be revived at the National sooner or later.\" In the meantime, Nichols keeps working and at 72 years of age he keeps dreaming. \"If I won the lottery I know exactly what I would do,\" he laughs. \"I would put myself in the Alan Ayckbourn or Andrew Lloyd Webber position and buy my own theatre. I would hire a company and have them do my plays over and over and over again, not caring if people came or not. I would love to do that. It would be wonderful to see the un-produced plays on a stage.\" Life at a glance: Peter Nichols Born: July 31 1927, Bristol. Married: 1959 Thelma Reed (one son, three daughters, Abigail deceased).

      "bodyText": "South Africa's highly respected cricket captain, Hansie Cronje, was last night accused of match fixing by police in India. Investigators in New Delhi played part of what they said was a taped phone conversation between Cronje and two Indian businessmen. They also released a transcript. Also mentioned in the conversation were three other members of the South African side: Herschelle Gibbs, Nicky Boje and Pieter Strydom. The allegations were vehemently denied by the United Cricket Board of South Africa and Cronje, who has presided over his team's emergence as a formidable cricketing nation. He said last night: \"I am stunned. The allegations are com pletely without substance. I have been privileged to play for South Africa since 1992 and I want to assure every South African that I have made a 100% effort to win every match that I have played. It has been an honour to play for South Africa and I would never do anything to let my country down.\" A statement released by Ali Bacher, managing director of the South African cricket board, said that the board was convinced the accusations were unfounded, and added: \"South African captain Hansie Cronje is a man of enormous integrity and honesty. He and his teammates Nicky Boje, Herschelle Gibbs and Pieter Strydom are emphatic that there is no substance to [the] allegations. Indian police have registered charges of criminal conspiracy against all four in connection with five one-day matches played during the South Africans' tour of India from March 9-19. India won the series 3-2. Rajesh Kalra, a wealthy Delhi businessman, has been arrested and remanded in custody, while another businessman, Sanjiv Chawla (also known as Sanjay Chawla), is wanted by police. Some reports in India say he may be in London. Mr Kalra was arrested in a dawn raid at his home in south Delhi and is to face further questioning today. Police in the Indian capital said that a tip-off led them to begin taping phone calls made to and by Cronje. The investigators allege that some of the conversations took place with a caller phoning from abroad ,while others took place in New Delhi. The South African team stayed at the Taj Palace hotel in New Delhi and it is alleged that Cronje was taped revealing which cricketers would be playing and also making references to payments. The police say that they have 12 tapes in total.",

Mr Byers - in common with his predecessor Peter Mandelson - believes permissive bankruptcy laws are one of the pillars of the entrepreneurial miracle in turn of the century America, allowing determined risk-takers to shrug off mistakes and return to the fray, older, wiser and raring to go. But data yesterday from the insolvency profession suggested Britain's rising trend of personal insolvency has less to do with risk-taking and dynamism than the Department of Trade and Industry imagines, and more to do with reckless, feckless borrowing. The Association of Business Recovery Professionals - R3, as the repo men style themselves - found 37% of bankruptcies are triggered by consumer debts, up from about 20% 10 years ago, and a fifth of that 37% is related to straightforward credit card debt. Mr Byers's blueprint allows the courts to discriminate between honest bankrupts, eligible for discharge after six months, and dishonest ones, facing up to 15 years as an undischarged bankrupt, five times the present maximum. But consumer borrowers may not be dishonest, simply irresponsible. For them, the quickie bankruptcy is, according to R3's Andrew Smith, simply a \"get out of jail free card\".

Meanwhile there was further evidence that even when its computers are working, the stock exchange's order driven trading system can still throw out funny numbers. At the close of play Tarmac was showing a fall of 150p to 435p, but dealers indicated there had been so little trade in the stock that a \"rogue\" closing price had been created. All other things being equal, the price should bounce back to around 580p on Monday morning.",

Standing down as a non-executive director, David Thomson insisted that his family was \"totally supportive of the company and the steps the new management have taken to grow the value of the business\". Through Woodbridge International, the Thomson family has a 19% stake in the package holidays group. Woodbridge has said that it is opposed to C&amp;N's 130p-a-share proposed offer. It is understood that Mr Thompson's departure was designed to avert any possible conflict of interest if the bid overtures become a definite offer. A Thomson Travel spokesman said: \"It puts them at arm's length. It was thought useful to clarify the situation.\" The change means there is no family representation on Thomson's board for the first time in its 25-year history. The business was established by Lord Thomson of Fleet, a Toronto-born businessman who moved to Britain and built up the Thomson Newspapers empire. During the 1960s, the Thomson media conglomerate included the Times, the Sunday Times, Scotsman and several regional publications. Lord Thomson diversified into holidays by buying three businesses - Universal Sky Tours, Britannia Airways and Riviera Holidays. The family kept control of Thomson Travel until the company floated in 1998. However, since that time the value of the Thomson family's stake in the business has fallen by \u00a360m to \u00a3260m due to a series of profits setbacks. On Thursday Thomson Travel refused an invitation to meet C&amp;N Touristic, a joint venture between Lufthansa airline and retailer Karstadt Quelle.

Sporting T-shirts bearing the slogan \"I've not been torched\" yesterday, Kleinwort's 3,500 investment bankers in the City could be in line for lock-ins worth twice their already hefty bonuses. </p> <p>Most of them had expected to lose their highly paid jobs as a result of the merger between their parent company, Dresdner Bank of Germany, and its rival Deutsche Bank. But they have been given a brief respite by the collapse of the record-breaking deal this week amid bitter recriminations. </p> <p>\"We continue to be green,\" one said yesterday in a reference to the colour of the bank's logo. </p> <p>Senior executives are expected to spend the weekend hastily constructing the latest pay deals. It will be the second such round of offers in a month - the first, arranged when the merger was announced in March, failed to prevent the departure of 100 staff including a number of highly regarded bankers. </p> <p>Kleinwort refused to commment officially yesterday but rivals believe the bank needs to act quickly if it is prevent complete destruction of the business through a mass defection of staff to rivals. </p> <p>Top executives at Kleinwort are expected to meet their German owners this weekend to try to end the uncertainty. As well as cementing terms of the emergency pay deals, the parties might try to arrange a way for staff to take a stake in the business, senior bankers suggested. </p> <p>Bernhard Walter - the Dresdner chairman who has fallen on his sword and will leave at the end of the month - moved yesterday to play down speculation that the bank was already in talks with another suitor. </p> <p>\"Whoever wants to speculate can just go on doing that. All I can say is that right now in Germany we have no concrete plans,\" Mr Walter said, reporting a 60% rise in pre-tax profit to \u20ac500m (\u00a3310m) for the first two months of the year. </p> <p>\"As for concrete foreign talks, none right now. Takeovers are always possible. They were possible before.

      "bodyText": "Delighted staff at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson expect lucrative \"golden handcuffs\" next week as the bank acts to stem a tide of departures. Sporting T-shirts bearing the slogan \"I've not been torched\" yesterday, Kleinwort's 3,500 investment bankers in the City could be in line for lock-ins worth twice their already hefty bonuses. Most of them had expected to lose their highly paid jobs as a result of the merger between their parent company, Dresdner Bank of Germany, and its rival Deutsche Bank. But they have been given a brief respite by the collapse of the record-breaking deal this week amid bitter recriminations. \"We continue to be green,\" one said yesterday in a reference to the colour of the bank's logo. Senior executives are expected to spend the weekend hastily constructing the latest pay deals. It will be the second such round of offers in a month - the first, arranged when the merger was announced in March, failed to prevent the departure of 100 staff including a number of highly regarded bankers. Kleinwort refused to commment officially yesterday but rivals believe the bank needs to act quickly if it is prevent complete destruction of the business through a mass defection of staff to rivals. Top executives at Kleinwort are expected to meet their German owners this weekend to try to end the uncertainty. As well as cementing terms of the emergency pay deals, the parties might try to arrange a way for staff to take a stake in the business, senior bankers suggested. Bernhard Walter - the Dresdner chairman who has fallen on his sword and will leave at the end of the month - moved yesterday to play down speculation that the bank was already in talks with another suitor. \"Whoever wants to speculate can just go on doing that. All I can say is that right now in Germany we have no concrete plans,\" Mr Walter said, reporting a 60% rise in pre-tax profit to \u20ac500m (\u00a3310m) for the first two months of the year. \"As for concrete foreign talks, none right now. Takeovers are always possible. They were possible before. They're possible now.\" His counterpart at Deutsche, Rolf Breuer, has so far retained his role despite speculation that he too will leave following the collapse of the merger, which was blamed on disagreements over Kleinwort. Mr Breuer originally described the investment bank as a jewel but it later emerged that he was considering selling it. Dresdner acknowledged yesterday that Kleinwort was the main driver behind its record profits last year of \u20ac2.1bn.

In sentencing him yesterday, Judge Gareth Lugan-Mawson in the Court of First Instance called Launder's crimes the worst case of corruption in Hong Kong's private sector, but he gave Launder less than the maximum sentence of seven years, in part because of his previous clean record. The judge also ordered Launder to repay Wardley's parent, banking company HSBC, the sum he had accepted and barred him from serving as a company director for seven years. Launder's defence had been that the money was paid because Launder was making investments for the companies, and did not constitute bribes. George Tan was jailed in 1996 to charges of conspiracy to defraud and was released in 1998. In the 20 years since Launder's offence, HSBC - which was then known as the Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation - has changed out of all recognition, taking over Britain's Midland Bank and reducing its emphasis on the Far East.

The fall came despite a rise in sales from \u00a313.2m to \u00a314.8m. However, operating profit before exceptional charges and player transfers provided some cheer.

News Corp is believed to be keen to split off its digital interests into a separate company, named Platco, which would involve Vivendi's Map internet joint venture with Vodafone AirTouch. Observers said News Corp may trade a minority interest for participation in Map and an agreement to include Vivendi's 25% stake in BSkyB in News Corp's digital venture.

The club cut an \u00a3823,000 loss in the first half of 1999 to a \u00a331,000 loss in the last six months. Pound blamed as 255 jobs go South African-owned Alloy Wheels International has blamed the strong pound and east European competition for its decision to close a factory in Cardiff with the loss of 255 jobs. The factory, which makes alloy wheels for the motor industry, is to close in July. There will also be job losses at the firm's tool-making division in nearby Taffs Well. The company said its staff had made dramatic improvements in productivity but it was unable to compete against cheap imports. News Corp in digital link-up Rupert Murdoch's News Corp and French conglomerate Vivendi confirmed yesterday that they are discussing plans to combine digital operations. News Corp is believed to be keen to split off its digital interests into a separate company, named Platco, which would involve Vivendi's Map internet joint venture with Vodafone AirTouch. Observers said News Corp may trade a minority interest for participation in Map and an agreement to include Vivendi's 25% stake in BSkyB in News Corp's digital venture. The venture will also include Mr Murdoch's Star TV, Sky Latin America and Foxtel. M&amp;S telecoms joint venture Marks and Spencer Ventures, the e-commerce investment arm of the retail chain, yesterday entered into a three-year strategic partnership with Talkcast Corp to jointly develop and market telecoms and digital products and services for M&amp;S customers. M&amp;S Ventures will take a minority stake in Talkcast, which will offer the services through in-store promotions, mailshots, and website links. The first product is to be launched by the autumn, and the groups aim to attract 1m users in two years.",

For the record, however, Varley's pay rose last year by 60% to \u00a3627,000, while Barrett took home \u00a31.3m for his first three months of work. </p> <p><strong> Zurich gnomes</strong><br> The bank, Varley argues, offers good employment prospects for staff, good service to customers and much-demanded rewards for all-important shareholders. \"Who owns Barclays? It's not 12 gnomes in Zurich. It's pensioners, your grandmother and mine,\" he says, adding that many of his 48,000 employees in the UK also own shares. \"They watch [how] they perform,\" he says. </p> <p> Without the branch closures - welcomed by the City when they were announced last year - Barclays might end up \"in a grave like Rover or NatWest\". This is why he will make \"an apology for the inconvenience\" to customers but not for the closures themselves. \"This industry is going through a seismic change. When industry goes through changes you've got to to be at the front and that's something that can be uncomfortable,\" he says. The changes are those sweeping through every aspect of life brought about by changing patterns of work and the development of the internet. Rural communities and deprived areas are not being hit just by bank branch closures but by the end of local pubs and corner shops. </p> <p> In 63 of the 171 locations in which Barclays is shutting branches, it is already the last bank on the local high street - a fact which has prompted criticism from the City that the bank has been too slow to cut its costs in an attempt to boost its returns to shareholders. To Varley, the fact that the bank is the last in some towns and villages is an indication of its commitment to the areas. </p> <p> He insists that the bank has made alternative arrangements for customers through the post office network - in a deal signed at the eleventh hour - and also in 50% of cases there is another branch within three miles. He argues that customers want to use the bank in a different way than in the past - to pay gas bills at 9.30pm, say, or check their balance at 2am. </p> <p> The bank claims to have more customers banking on the internet than any other, with 750,000, and says that another 20,000 registered last week alone. Even after the branch closures Barclays insists that it will still have more branches than any of its rivals - other than Lloyds TSB, with 1,729. \"That's more than twice Nationwide, and three times Tesco, and both claim to have national coverage,\" says Varley. </p> <p><strong>Under scrutiny</strong><br> The timing of the closures is not helped either by the fact that banks, always the people's enemy, are under unprecedented scrutiny as a result of the government's Cruickshank review. If Varley harbours any regrets about the decision to close all the branches on a single day while rivals have eased their closure programmes by doing them in dribs and drabs, he refuses to admit to them. A solicitor by training, this is not his first brush with controversy. </p> <p> The issue of charging customers for withdrawing money from cash machines was raised by Barclays when it infuriated its competitors by altering the way it structured its charges. While customers had been paying to take cash out of machines for years, Barclays ended up receiving the brunt of the criticism for its proposed charges. </p> <p> Described as extremely intelligent - he has a first class degree in history - and always polite, Varley's business last year generated \u00a31.7bn of the \u00a32.4bn profits the bank made last year. When he took on this role two years ago on April Fool's Day - which incidentally is also his birthday - he was cited as the heir apparent to the then chief executive, Martin Taylor. Much water has passed under the bridge since then, with Taylor flouncing out after a boardroom row and leaving the bank with a lengthy search for another chief executive. The first choice left after just one day in the job because of a health complaint, with Barrett eventually taking the helm in October.</p> <p> <strong> Ambitious fantasy</strong><br> Varley admits he harbours ambitions for the \"fantastic job\" but says he can learn from his new boss, Matt Barrett. He is rumoured to have been a strong candidate for the role during last year's extended search and it is unclear whether his 18-year marriage to Carolyn Pease, a member of one of the Quaker families which founded the bank, would be a help or a hindrance to achieve that goal. </p> <p>Fiercely protective of his private life, he first joined the bank in 1982, working at the now defunct BZW investment bank and the asset management operation before moving to his current role and joining the board. His CV makes a reference to his mysterious one year's absence from BZW, the troublesome operation which was another source of reputation-battering stuff for the bank and ultimately the root of Taylor's sudden departure. Despite criticism relating to the timing of the \u00a315m \"brand building exercise\", Varley is unrepentant about the new advertising campaign - unusual by banking standards, hinged as it is on the the idea that Barclays is big. </p> <p> He highlights ambitions for the bank outside the UK, particularly in mainland Europe, and is an advocate of the view that in the coming years there will be so many mergers and takeovers that only a handful of major banks will survive. Unsurprisingly, he believes Barclays will be one of them. \"The Barclays brand is one of the great financial industry brands of the world,\" he says. But for now the bank's attentions are likely to be closer to home as it tries to defuse the controversy. </p> <p><strong> Adverse publicity</strong><br> Varley is full of praise for the employees in the Barclays branches around the country who, he admits, are having a \"quite a difficult time because of the adverse publicity\". He insists that the bank can now claw back its credibility after the torrent of bad news and damage to its reputation. \"We want to move on,\" he says. But the major investors who are beginning to express concern about the risk of further damage to the accident-prone bank's reputational risk will not be willing to wait long.</p>",

Described as extremely intelligent - he has a first class degree in history - and always polite, Varley's business last year generated \u00a31.7bn of the \u00a32.4bn profits the bank made last year. When he took on this role two years ago on April Fool's Day - which incidentally is also his birthday - he was cited as the heir apparent to the then chief executive, Martin Taylor. Much water has passed under the bridge since then, with Taylor flouncing out after a boardroom row and leaving the bank with a lengthy search for another chief executive. The first choice left after just one day in the job because of a health complaint, with Barrett eventually taking the helm in October. Ambitious fantasy Varley admits he harbours ambitions for the \"fantastic job\" but says he can learn from his new boss, Matt Barrett. He is rumoured to have been a strong candidate for the role during last year's extended search and it is unclear whether his 18-year marriage to Carolyn Pease, a member of one of the Quaker families which founded the bank, would be a help or a hindrance to achieve that goal. Fiercely protective of his private life, he first joined the bank in 1982, working at the now defunct BZW investment bank and the asset management operation before moving to his current role and joining the board. His CV makes a reference to his mysterious one year's absence from BZW, the troublesome operation which was another source of reputation-battering stuff for the bank and ultimately the root of Taylor's sudden departure. Despite criticism relating to the timing of the \u00a315m \"brand building exercise\", Varley is unrepentant about the new advertising campaign - unusual by banking standards, hinged as it is on the the idea that Barclays is big. He highlights ambitions for the bank outside the UK, particularly in mainland Europe, and is an advocate of the view that in the coming years there will be so many mergers and takeovers that only a handful of major banks will survive. Unsurprisingly, he believes Barclays will be one of them. \"The Barclays brand is one of the great financial industry brands of the world,\" he says. But for now the bank's attentions are likely to be closer to home as it tries to defuse the controversy. Adverse publicity Varley is full of praise for the employees in the Barclays branches around the country who, he admits, are having a \"quite a difficult time because of the adverse publicity\". He insists that the bank can now claw back its credibility after the torrent of bad news and damage to its reputation. \"We want to move on,\" he says. But the major investors who are beginning to express concern about the risk of further damage to the accident-prone bank's reputational risk will not be willing to wait long.",
