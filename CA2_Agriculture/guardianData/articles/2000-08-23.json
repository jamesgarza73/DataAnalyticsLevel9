Like all good documentaries, the real narrative emerges slowly, and here it reveals itself to be the story of Takeuchi, one of the recruits who has to pass a stringent multi-bout test to prove herself worthy of making her professional debut. </p> <p>Outside the ring, Takeuchi is a shy, sweet-tempered giggler; inside, she becomes a ball of screaming energy, desperate to impress her coach and promoter. As she is routinely humiliated and reduced to a snivelling, bloodied wreck, Takeuchi's odyssey becomes genuinely heart-rending; but it's all too evident that, in sparring bout after sparring bout, she lacks the sheer bodyweight and strength to make a natural wrestler. </p> <p>Longinotto and her co-film-maker Jano Williams don't inquire too deeply into the choreographed nature of what they are witnessing; their detached style makes a virtue of letting the fighters speak and act for themselves.

The key difference is that Stoppard interweaves life in a Derbyshire country house from 1809 to 1812 with the present day. In the earlier era we see the precocious Thomasina Coverley not only falling in love with her Byronic tutor but anticipating modern ideas about chaos theory and irregular \"fractal\" geometry.

The play is a fantastically ingenious construct, but it lacks a strong internal dynamic, and Wood's production, explanatory rather than emotional, makes you aware of the lack of narrative propulsion. The one genuinely moving moment comes when Thomasina's tutor, responding to her lament over Caesar's burning of the Alexandrian library, argues that whatever is historically lost is recovered in the long march of humanity. </p> <p>Wood's production looks handsome and is well-cast. The outstanding performance comes from Eleanor David, who lends Hannah, the modern scholar and hermit-seeker, a mocking, ironic, laid-back intelligence that effortlessly exposes Jay Villiers's blustering vanity as her academic rival. Laura Howard and Robert Hands are also quietly impressive as Thomasina and her tutor without ever quite conveying the contours of burgeoning passion.

Perhaps he felt he needed to make an immediate impression, for he was a last-minute substitute for the popular but indisposed Matthias Goerne. </p> <p>Henschel, however, didn't need to worry: in a stunning performance of Mahler's Early Songs, orchestrated by Berio, he soon had the audience in the palm of his hand. His voice is lighter than Goerne's - a flash of silver as opposed to Goerne's bronze gleam. He floats pianissimo high notes with a tender ease rare in baritones. Elsewhere, his experience as a singing actor spoke volumes as phrase after phrase of the dark, charnel-house texts was brilliantly laced with irony. The EUYO wove tendrils of elegant sound around him. Ashkenazy impressively emphasised both the orchestral sections that sound like genuine Mahler and those moments of sparse strangeness that are very much Berio's own. </p> <p>This was the high point, for the works that flanked it came over unevenly. Strauss's Don Juan wasn't quite the show-stopper it could have been. Ashkenazy sees the piece as being about love rather than sex, presenting a portrait of a man whose emotions, though transitory, are genuine. It is a valid interpretation, but ultimately one misses the visceral excitement, the hints of obscenity and the orgiastic atmosphere that should hang over the piece. </p> <p>Tchaikovsky's Fifth Symphony was done at high neurotic voltage, occasionally tipping into overblown melodrama in the process. The EUYO playing is exemplary, with some glorious instrumental solos in both works. On occasion, however, the balance lacks cogency, with the brass tending to drown out the rest of the orchestra. </p> <p>***** Unmissable **** Recommended *** Enjoyable ** Mediocre * Terrible</p>",

Trapero concentrates on Rulo's stolid bravery: when he loses out to a younger, fitter competitor for the crane job, his only option is to travel thousands of miles south to a building project in Patagonia - sacrificing a flourishing love affair as he does so - on a vague friend-of-a-friend promise. That he encounters genuine comradeship in a trying environment is almost incidental; the job comes to an end, and the work cycle grinds on remorselessly. </p> <p>Much has been made of Trapero's debt to neo-realism, and while the monochromatic visuals and thematic common ground with Bicycle Thieves are undoubtedly powerful, Crane World belongs to a much more stripped-down school of realism that is present in some strength at Edinburgh. </p> <p> Tonight and Saturday.

      "body": "<p>As Patrick Vieira considers taking his most dramatic early exit yet, this time out of English football altogether, he may be heartened to hear that rivals, as well as team-mates, are insisting he should stay. </p> <p>This even includes Liverpool's Dietmar Hamann, the victim of the tackle that led to Vieira's second red card in three days at Highbury on Monday, who said: \"It would be bad for English football if he left. He is a fantastic player and not a dirty one. He plays the game in a fair-minded way.\" </p> <p>In any case, even if Vieira left Arsenal it is difficult to imagine where he could go in search of greater understanding, short of signing for the Priory Clinic XI. In Europe's main leagues a man of his combative instincts would be unlikely to complete 90 minutes of any game, and in Italy he would be lucky to survive the pre-match warm-up. </p> <p>Vieira understands that, which is central to his frustration, feeling forced out of his natural environment by referees he believes are singling him out. But though he has at times invited punishment, unnecessarily and even recklessly, he finds himself playing in England at a time when beleaguered referees are trying to second-guess the assessors and rule-tweakers who govern them. </p> <p>The English game is the fastest and most physical in the world, which used to invite a matching level of tolerance and discretion from officials who tried their best to distinguish between malevolent fouls and mistimed ones. Now those qualities have been reclassified as vices for referees who have been instructed, as they were at the beginning of last season, to take a zero-tolerance attitude to foul play. </p> <p>Vieira, who was sent off only once in each of the previous two seasons, made a serious attempt to temper his game after his red card against West Ham last October, when he received a six-match ban not for his tackle but for spitting at Neil Ruddock. </p> <p>To a degree he has even managed to temper his temper.

      "bodyText": "As Patrick Vieira considers taking his most dramatic early exit yet, this time out of English football altogether, he may be heartened to hear that rivals, as well as team-mates, are insisting he should stay. This even includes Liverpool's Dietmar Hamann, the victim of the tackle that led to Vieira's second red card in three days at Highbury on Monday, who said: \"It would be bad for English football if he left. He is a fantastic player and not a dirty one. He plays the game in a fair-minded way.\" In any case, even if Vieira left Arsenal it is difficult to imagine where he could go in search of greater understanding, short of signing for the Priory Clinic XI. In Europe's main leagues a man of his combative instincts would be unlikely to complete 90 minutes of any game, and in Italy he would be lucky to survive the pre-match warm-up. Vieira understands that, which is central to his frustration, feeling forced out of his natural environment by referees he believes are singling him out. But though he has at times invited punishment, unnecessarily and even recklessly, he finds himself playing in England at a time when beleaguered referees are trying to second-guess the assessors and rule-tweakers who govern them. The English game is the fastest and most physical in the world, which used to invite a matching level of tolerance and discretion from officials who tried their best to distinguish between malevolent fouls and mistimed ones. Now those qualities have been reclassified as vices for referees who have been instructed, as they were at the beginning of last season, to take a zero-tolerance attitude to foul play. Vieira, who was sent off only once in each of the previous two seasons, made a serious attempt to temper his game after his red card against West Ham last October, when he received a six-match ban not for his tackle but for spitting at Neil Ruddock. To a degree he has even managed to temper his temper. And he was so confident that he could offer further proof that he was reformed this season that he struck a bet with his best friend Olivier Dacourt that he would have the better disciplinary record of the two of them. Dacourt, in Germany preparing for Leeds's Champions League qualifier against Munich 1860 tonight, says: \"I phoned Pat after the Sunderland game to tell him that he would never win the bet. He managed to joke then but he must be very upset now. \"When you watch the incident against Liverpool, can you tell me that he was not unlucky?

</p> <p>nine-ten (3). </p> <p>The new ball can still be taken after 100 overs. </p> <p>A no ball is worth two runs to the batting side; runs scored off a no ball count in addition to the two-run penalty. </p> <p>A single-innings match may be played when bad weather prevents any start until less than eight hours remain. A win earns 12 points, a tie six and a draw three but there are no bonus points. </p> <p>*Note: in a <strong> draw where the scores finish level</strong> , the side batting in the fourth innings earn 6 points their opponents 4, plus bonus points. </p> <p><strong> Today</strong> <strong> NATIONAL LEAGUE</strong><br> </p> <p><strong> Second Division: Colchester </strong> (one day; 16.10):<strong> </strong> Essex v Surrey. </p> <p><strong> TOUR MATCH</strong><br> </p> <p><strong> Taunton </strong> (four days; 11.0): Somerset v West Indies. </p> <p><strong> TRIANGULAR TOURNAMENT</strong><br> </p> <p><strong> Singapore </strong> (one day; 2.45am): South Africa v Pakistan. </p> <p><strong> SECOND XI CHAMPIONSHIP</strong><br> </p> <p>(Three days; 11.0) <strong> Milton Keynes: </strong> Northamptonshire v Leicestershire. </p> <p><strong> Harrogate: </strong> Yorkshire v Glamorgan. </p> <p><strong> Gateshead Fell: </strong> Durham v Essex. </p> <p><strong> SECOND U-19 TEST</strong> (Second day of four; today 11.0) <br> </p> <p><strong> England v Sri Lanka </strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Northampton:</strong> England U-19 trail Sri Lanka U-19 by 64 runs with four first-innings wickets remaining. </p> <p><strong> SRI LANKA </strong> <strong> First Innings </strong> (overnight: 223-5) </p> <p><strong> *K Weeraratne</strong> c Bell b Bishop <strong> 28 </strong></p> <p><strong>M Pushpakumara</strong> not out <strong> 42 </strong></p> <p><strong>K S Lokuarachchi</strong> lbw b Bishop <strong> 0 </strong></p> <p><strong>G G R Dhammika</strong> b Murtagh <strong> 8 </strong></p> <p><strong>W C A Ganegama</strong> lbw b Murtagh <strong> 6 </strong></p> <p><strong>R A P Nissanka</strong> c Wallace b Harrison <strong> 9 </strong></p> <p><strong>Extras</strong> (b6, lb9, w4, nb4) <strong> 23 </strong></p> <p><strong>Total</strong> (99 overs) <strong> 286 </strong></p> <p><strong>Fall cont:</strong> 240, 240, 260, 272. </p> <p><strong> Bowling:</strong> Harrison 15-4-51-2; Murtagh 23-5-66-3; Bishop 24-9-71-4; Panesar 13-6-33-1; Dalrymple 12-7-25-0; Pattison 12-6-25-0. </p> <p><strong> ENGLAND </strong> <strong> First Innings </strong></p> <p><strong>G J Pratt</strong> c Daniels b Ganegama <strong> 25 </strong></p> <p><strong>N Peng</strong> c Gajanayake b Dhammika <strong> 122 </strong></p> <p><strong>I R Bell</strong> c Pushpakumara b Kandamby <strong> 31 </strong></p> <p><strong>Kadeer Ali</strong> c Perera b Kandamby <strong> 4 </strong></p> <p><strong>I Pattison</strong> not out <strong> 21 </strong></p> <p><strong>J W M Dalrymple</strong> c Daniels b Dhammika <strong> 5 </strong></p> <p><strong>*M A Wallace</strong> c Mubarak b Dhammika <strong> 1 </strong></p> <p><strong>D S Harrison</strong> not out <strong> 0</strong></p> <p><strong>Extras</strong> (b3, lb1, nb9) <strong> 13 </strong></p> <p><strong>Total</strong> (for 6, 77 overs) <strong> 222 </strong></p> <p><strong>Fall:</strong> 64, 140, 164, 199, 220, 222. </p> <p><strong> To bat:</strong> J E Bishop, T J Murtagh, M S Panesar. </p> <p><strong> Bowling:</strong> Nissanka 5-0-41-0; Ganegama 6-0-29-1; Dhammika 27-9-45-3; Weeraratne 5-2-16-0; Lokuarachchi 9-4-18-0; Pushpakumara 7-1-29-0; Kandamby 18-6-40-2. </p> <p><strong> Umpires:</strong> J H Evans and R A White.</p>",

As before, a win earns 12 points , a tie 6 , a normal draw 4 (see later *) and a defeat none, plus any bonus points accrued for batting and bowling in each first innings. Bonus points are now reckoned on the score in the first 130 overs, not 120 overs as in recent seasons. Batting: now 5 pts can be earned (4 last year) 200 -249 runs (1pt); 250-299 (2); 300-349 (3); 350-399 (4); 400 or over (5) Bowling: now only 3 points available (4) three-five wickets (1); six-eight wickets (2); nine-ten (3). The new ball can still be taken after 100 overs. A no ball is worth two runs to the batting side; runs scored off a no ball count in addition to the two-run penalty. A single-innings match may be played when bad weather prevents any start until less than eight hours remain. A win earns 12 points, a tie six and a draw three but there are no bonus points. *Note: in a draw where the scores finish level , the side batting in the fourth innings earn 6 points their opponents 4, plus bonus points.

      "body": "<p>The number of people sleeping rough in England has fallen by more than a third over the past two years, according to figures released yesterday by Louise Casey, the government's homelessness tsar. </p> <p>She told the prime minister that good progress was being made towards his target of bringing all rough sleepers in from the cold. But there was a huge amount more to do to help those addicted to a life of drugs and street crime - and to support vulnerable people who were in danger of becoming the next generation of down and outs. </p> <p>In a progress report to Tony Blair, Ms Casey's rough sleepers unit said there were now about 1,180 homeless people on the streets in England. That was 28% down on this time last year and a 36% reduction on the year before. </p> <p>The largest concentrations of rough sleepers continued to be in central London boroughs, with nearly a fifth of the national total being in Westminster. </p> <p>Oxford, Brighton, Nottingham, Birmingham, Manchester, Cambridge, Bournemouth and Bristol each had more than a score of rough sleepers, acording to latest estimates. </p> <p>They will be among 32 authorities outside London to benefit from an extra \u00a39.5m distributed yesterday by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions as part of a \u00a3200m programme to reduce numbers of rough sleepers by at least two-thirds by 2002. </p> <p>Ms Casey said achievements so far included the appointment of teams in London and other big cities to make contact with rough sleepers and give them the help needed to \"come inside\". </p> <p>An extra 800 hostel bed spaces for vulnerable rough sleepers had been created in London, bringing the total to more than 2,000. There were also better services to combat drug misuse among rough sleepers and projects to help people leaving the streets to move on from hostel accommodation into training and work. </p> <p>Shaks Ghosh, chief executive of Crisis, a charity for the single homeless, said the progress report was an important first step. New bed spaces and services helped to reduce numbers sleeping rough, especially outside London. </p> <p>\"But I am worried about the numbers of people who are coming off the streets only to be warehoused in hostels, emergency shelters, and other temporary accommodation for months and even years.\" They needed support if they were to have a chance of rebuilding their lives. </p> <p>Crisis estimated there was a \"hidden homeless\" population of 400,000, including people in squats, bed and breakfast, and sleeping on friends' sofas. It said many were at risk of becoming the next wave of rough sleepers. </p> <p>Archie Norman, shadow environment secretary, said: \"This is a disgrace, not a triumph for New Labour. The government has promised \u00a3200m to tackle rough sleeping - \u00a3125,000 per rough sleeper. Yet even if they have managed to get 400 people off the streets, this is still less than the rise in homelessness.\" </p> <p>Figures provided to the Conservatives from the Commons library showed 27,050 were classified as priority homeless in the first quarter of 1997, compared with 27,700 in the first quarter of 2000.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The number of people sleeping rough in England has fallen by more than a third over the past two years, according to figures released yesterday by Louise Casey, the government's homelessness tsar. She told the prime minister that good progress was being made towards his target of bringing all rough sleepers in from the cold. But there was a huge amount more to do to help those addicted to a life of drugs and street crime - and to support vulnerable people who were in danger of becoming the next generation of down and outs. In a progress report to Tony Blair, Ms Casey's rough sleepers unit said there were now about 1,180 homeless people on the streets in England. That was 28% down on this time last year and a 36% reduction on the year before. The largest concentrations of rough sleepers continued to be in central London boroughs, with nearly a fifth of the national total being in Westminster. Oxford, Brighton, Nottingham, Birmingham, Manchester, Cambridge, Bournemouth and Bristol each had more than a score of rough sleepers, acording to latest estimates. They will be among 32 authorities outside London to benefit from an extra \u00a39.5m distributed yesterday by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions as part of a \u00a3200m programme to reduce numbers of rough sleepers by at least two-thirds by 2002. Ms Casey said achievements so far included the appointment of teams in London and other big cities to make contact with rough sleepers and give them the help needed to \"come inside\". An extra 800 hostel bed spaces for vulnerable rough sleepers had been created in London, bringing the total to more than 2,000. There were also better services to combat drug misuse among rough sleepers and projects to help people leaving the streets to move on from hostel accommodation into training and work. Shaks Ghosh, chief executive of Crisis, a charity for the single homeless, said the progress report was an important first step. New bed spaces and services helped to reduce numbers sleeping rough, especially outside London. \"But I am worried about the numbers of people who are coming off the streets only to be warehoused in hostels, emergency shelters, and other temporary accommodation for months and even years.\" They needed support if they were to have a chance of rebuilding their lives. Crisis estimated there was a \"hidden homeless\" population of 400,000, including people in squats, bed and breakfast, and sleeping on friends' sofas. It said many were at risk of becoming the next wave of rough sleepers. Archie Norman, shadow environment secretary, said: \"This is a disgrace, not a triumph for New Labour. The government has promised \u00a3200m to tackle rough sleeping - \u00a3125,000 per rough sleeper. Yet even if they have managed to get 400 people off the streets, this is still less than the rise in homelessness.\" Figures provided to the Conservatives from the Commons library showed 27,050 were classified as priority homeless in the first quarter of 1997, compared with 27,700 in the first quarter of 2000.",

Yet one of the most worrying aspects of the recent string of incidents is that they do not involve new start-up ventures, but blue-chip companies with millions of pounds at their disposal to spend on gold-plated systems. Some consumers will decide that until they are more confident about the ability of online banks to look after their money and personal details safely, they will steer well clear. Unfortunately, security problems are not confined exclusively to cyberspace. The Guardian this week revealed that insurer Scottish Widows's phone-banking arm sent at least two policyholders other people's confidential banking details in the post. Sandra Bruce-Gordon, of Staines, and Jane Ireland, of Manchester, received details of each other's finances. Egg Barclays online banking PowerGen Woolworths",

At a meeting in Geneva, the UN committee on the elimination of racial discrimination said that ethnic minorities in Britain were feeling \"increasingly vulnerable\" to racist attacks and harassment. It also condemned institutional racism in the police and other public bodies which, it said, had led to \"serious shortcomings with regard to investigations into racist incidents\". The damning criticism came in response to a report submitted to the UN in May by the British government into what measures had been taken to tackle racism over the past three years. Officials from the Home Office and the Foreign Office travelled to Switzerland last week to try to head off criticism, insisting that the government had met most of the committee's recommendations from the last UN report on Britain, soon after Labour came to power in 1997. But in an embarrassing report, the UN committee, which meets every three years and is responsible for monitoring racism in member states, urged Britain to \"take leadership in sending out positive messages about asylum seekers\" and formulate ways of protecting them from racial harassment. It urged the government to tackle high unemployment and school exclusion rates among ethnic minorities, and recommended that ministers develop a cross-departmental strategy to combat racial discrimination. The report did, however, praise recent moves by the home secretary, Jack Straw, to increase penalties for racially motivated crimes. It also welcomed the government's action plan developed following the publication of the Macpherson report in February 1999 into the murder of the black teenager Stephen Lawrence. The UN's concerns follow a report submitted by more than 30 human rights organisations, including the civil rights group Liberty, the anti-racist 1990 Trust and the Refugee Council which condemned the government's record on race relations and deaths in custody, and claimed that the policy on asylum-seekers \"gives comfort to racists\" and has led to increased racial tension. Ministers will be disappointed that the UN committee backed many of the criticisms made by British civil rights groups. A Home Office spokesman said: \"We have not yet seen this report and obviously we will want to look at it in detail before commenting on specific criticisms, but we believe that some of the comments are unfair.\" \"Promoting racial equality is a top priority for this government, which has done more to promote race equality than any previous government.\"",

      "body": "<p>National Lottery Commission statement in full.</p> <p>1. This written statement discharges the duty of the National Lottery Commission (\"the Commission\") under paragraph 9(2)(a) of Schedule 2A to the National Lottery etc Act 1993 (as amended)(\"the 1993 Act\"). That paragraph requires the National Lottery Commission to: \"arrange for the publication, in such manner as they think fit, of a written statement of their reasons - (a) for any decision which they may make to grant, or not to grant, to any particular applicant a licence under section 5.\" </p> <p>2. On 15 August 2000, the National Lottery Commission decided, in response to the written applications that it had received from Camelot Group plc and The People's Lottery Ltd, not to grant a seven year licence under section 5 of the 1993 Act to either of the applicants following the Invitation to Apply process. </p> <p>3. The process of evaluating the applications, which began with the submissions by the two applicants on 29 February 2000 of application documents in response to the Commission's Invitation to Apply, involved the Commission in: - evaluation of the originally submitted application documents; - evaluation of supplementary application documents submitted by both applicants in response to requests from the Commission for clarifications of and improvements to certain of the offered commitments; - receiving presentations from both applicants; - undertaking visits to sites relevant to the application. </p> <p>4. In considering whether to grant a section 5 licence, the Commission considered the applications in the light both of the matters to which it must have regard by virtue of sections 4 and 5 of the 1993 Act and of the evaluation criteria set out in Chapter 4 of the Invitation to Apply. </p> <p>5. The reasons for the Commission's decision are set out below. </p> <p>THE COMMISSION'S OVERRIDING DUTIES 6. The Commission has three overriding duties, which are set out in section 4 of the 1993 Act. That section requires that the Commission shall exercise its functions in the manner it: \"considers most likely to secure- (a) that the National Lottery is run, and every lottery that forms part of it is promoted, with all due propriety, and (b) that the interests of every participant in a lottery that forms part of the National Lottery are protected.\" Subject to these, the Commission shall: \"do its best to secure that the net proceeds of the National Lottery are as great as possible.\" </p> <p>7. The Commission considered, having consulted widely, that it was most likely to meet these overriding duties in selecting the licensee for the next licence period by undertaking an open competition. It set out the terms of the competition in the Invitation to Apply, which it issued in November 1999 following extensive consultation. This provided the basis for the competition. </p> <p>8. The Commission is required, under the terms of section 5(3) of the 1993 Act, to consider the applications that are made to it containing such information as it has specified (in this case in its Invitation to Apply). Whilst it can invite the applicants to clarify or improve that information, it can only do so in a manner which is fair to both applicants. It cannot itself add to, or go beyond, the information submitted in the applications in making its evaluation. It must be satisfied, in accepting an application, that its overriding duties will be met and it must, in the conduct of its evaluation, act entirely fairly between both applicants. </p> <p>ARRANGEMENTS TO SECURE THAT THE NATIONAL LOTTERY IS RUN WITH ALL DUE PROPRIETY AND APPLICANTS' FITNESS AND PROPRIETY </p> <p>9. The Commission has an overriding responsibility under Section 4(1)(a) of the 1993 Act, which requires the Commission in determining the grant of any section 5 licence to be satisfied that the arrangements which are made are those most likely to secure that the National Lottery will be run with all due propriety. During the evaluation process, the Commission conducted an investigation which established that GTech, the supplier of lottery gaming systems to Camelot, had identified a software fault and had corrected that fault secretly, in breach of established software change control procedures and without disclosing it to Camelot or the Commission's predecessor, OFLOT. The fault had been in place since the beginning of the lottery and was successfully rectified on 27 July 1998. In certain limited circumstances, it caused duplicate transactions to be recorded on the gaming systems, with only a single ticket being produced. This resulted in an overcharge to retailers and, if the ticket were a prize-winner, distortion errors in the distribution of the prize fund for between the prize-winners of the draw . </p> <p>10. The decision by GTech to take this course of action to correct the fault secretly was taken personally by the former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, at a meeting at which the former President and Chief Operating Officer was also present. The decision was taken against written advice from the General Manager of Gtech UK that Camelot and OFLOT should be told. The GTech Board was not informed then or subsequently, until the matter was raised with them by the Commission. </p> <p>11. One consequence of this decision was that no action could be taken to check the impact upon prize-winners and retailers, and make arrangements for restitution where appropriate. Hence, the integrity of the lottery was compromised. The former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer was aware of this consequence at the time that the decision was taken. </p> <p>12. In response to the Commission's investigation, a number of measures were taken by GTech and further measures were proposed by both GTech and Camelot. These can be summarised as follows: </p> <p>13. GTech: has changed its Board structure. The individuals involved in the decision not to notify Camelot or OFLOT of the problem, and its subsequent resolution, have left GTech. The posts of Chairman and Chief Executive have been permanently separated, and it is proposed that the membership and structure of the Board will be strengthened. has created a new committee of the Board - the Compliance and Corporate Governance Committee - which will oversee the proper handling and resolution of ethical issues, including the handling of software problems. It will be made up of non- executives and the Vice-President of Compliance will report directly to it. Its Chairman will provide an annual certificate to Camelot and the Commission, and will meet Camelot's Chairman on a regular basis. will review its Code of Conduct fully, and will also review arrangements for monitoring compliance with the Code. The Chairman and the Board will actively promote the Code and emphasise the need to comply with it under all circumstances. has agreed to the appointment of a dedicated account manager within GTech responsible for the Camelot account and with access to the Board. will have independent reviews undertaken of all its software development processes and process documentation, which will be made available to Camelot and the Commission. GTech will obtain certification against a number of international industry standards. Compliance with these procedures will be independently audited and certified to Camelot and the Commission annually. </p> <p>14. Camelot: - will extend the scope of its reviews of GTech's performance. - will appoint a quality assurance/IT specialist to work full-time alongside GTech's quality assurance department. - will improve its arrangements for management of suppliers and control over the software development life cycle. - will ensure delivery of the above undertakings by itself and GTech through revised contract terms and additional licence conditions. - 15. The Commission is now considering separately the issue of breaches by Camelot of the terms of the existing licence arising from the software incident, both in relation to change control procedures and record keeping obligations. </p> <p>16. Generally the Commission remains extremely concerned about the behaviour of GTech, which would again, if Camelot's application were accepted, be a key supplier on whom Camelot places considerable reliance. The senior executives who participated in the decision to take the course of action set out above had, following the departure of the previous Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, given personal assurances to the Director General of the National Lottery that GTech would introduce and rigorously apply a Code of Conduct intended to enforce proper corporate behaviour . Their decision, which contravened the newly implemented Code of Conduct, was taken three months after those assurances were given and was not disclosed within GTECH in further contravention of the Code. The Commission has therefore decided to review in November 2000 the adequacy of the revised propriety arrangements which have been or are to be put in place by both GTech and Camelot. </p> <p>17. The Commission has an overriding duty under section 4(1)(a) of the 1993 Act to be satisfied in granting any section 5 licence that the arrangements which are made are those most likely to secure that the National Lottery will be run with all due propriety. The Commission has as yet unresolved concerns about the future long term propriety of the arrangements made within GTech and between GTech and Camelot to ensure that the National Lottery regulator's fit and proper person jurisdiction in the context of licence revocation is not invoked again. These concerns have led it to conclude that it cannot presently be certain that the outstanding measures offered will be implemented in full and will have the necessary impact on GTech's culture and conduct so as to ensure propriety over the life of a seven year licence. It will not be in a position to judge further within what timescale propriety can be demonstrated in respect of the previous licence until, at the earliest, the conclusion of its November review. The Commission has therefore concluded that it cannot, at this stage, be satisfied that a grant of a seven year section 5 licence to Camelot would be consistent with the discharge of its overriding duty under section 4(1)(a) of the 1993 Act. The individuals responsible for the decision have now left GTech and the Commission has received full assistance and a range of undertakings from the GTech and Camelot boards which should, if fully and effectively implemented, prevent a reoccurrence of the unacceptable behaviour demonstrated in this case. On this basis, and having taken legal advice, the Commission decided not to proceed with a determination that GTech is not presently or would not in future be a fit and proper person to manage part of the business of running the National Lottery for the purposes respectively of sections 10(3) and 5(5) of the 1993 Act. However, the Commission remains extremely concerned at the conduct of GTech's senior executives. The senior executives who participated in the decision to take the course of action set out above had, following the departure of the previous Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, given personal assurances to the Director-General of the National Lottery that GTech would introduce and rigorously apply a code of conduct intended to enforce proper corporate behaviour. The decision, which contravened the newly implemented code of conduct, was taken three months after those assurances were given and was not disclosed within GTech in further contravention of the code. Given these concerns, the Commission has concluded that it could not be certain, at the time of its decision on the award of the section 5 licence, that the assurances that the boards of Camelot and GTech have given would be implemented in full and would have the necessary impact upon GTech's culture and conduct so as to ensure propriety over the life of a seven year licence. The proposals could well have that effect, but they were not yet sufficiently in place and operational to be capable of evaluation. The Commission therefore decided that, given the inability of both GTech's board and Camelot to ensure proper behaviour by GTech's most senior executives in the past, it could not presently be satisfied that the arrangements proposed by Camelot were sufficiently likely to secure that the National Lottery would be run with all due propriety for it to accept Camelot's application and award it a seven year licence. </p> <p>18. The Commission was satisfied that The People's Lottery is a fit and proper body to run the National Lottery for the purposes of section 5(4) of the 1993 Act. ARRANGEMENTS TO SECURE THAT THE INTERESTS OF EVERY PARTICIPANT IN A LOTTERY THAT FORMS PART OF THE NATIONAL LOTTERY ARE PROTECTED </p> <p>19. The Commission has an overriding responsibility, under Section 4(1)(b) of the 1993 Act, which requires the Commission in determining the grant of any section 5 licence, to ensure that the interests of every participant in a lottery that forms part of the National Lottery are protected. </p> <p>20. The Commission considers that it is required, under section 4(1)(b), to reject any bid where it is not satisfied that adequate arrangements have been made for the protection of the interests of every participant in the National Lottery. This includes arrangements to ensure that all prize-winners will receive the prizes due to them and that any holders of tickets in a draw which does not, for any reason, take place receive full reimbursement of the cost of the ticket. These arrangements must have full effect in all circumstances, including revocation of the Section 5 licence and the failure, by way of insolvency or otherwise, of the operator. </p> <p>21. The Commission considers that, in order for it to be satisfied that adequate arrangements have been made for the protection of the interests of every participant in the National Lottery, an application must contain unequivocal commitments which are clearly capable of being put into effect both legally and practically, which are not contingent on the agreement of any other party, and which will secure in full the interests of players. </p> <p>22. The People's Lottery introduced a new proposal for the protection of the interests of players in the improvements it submitted to the Commission on 17 July 2000 as part of its application. It adopted these new proposals as its final submission in its clarificatory letter of 31 July 2000. The new proposals were clearly conditional and involved significant legal uncertainties. They stated, for example, that any assignment (of 50% of proceeds of ticket sales) would be conditional upon satisfactory resolution of any stamp duty and asset transfer issues arising and that opinions from Counsel about the robustness of the prize payment security structure proposed would be required. </p> <p>23. The Commission concluded, having received legal advice, that the arrangements proposed were so conditional and uncertain that they were not capable of acceptance. Neither could it be satisfied that the application was likely to secure that the interests of every participant in a lottery that forms part of the National Lottery would be protected. Had the arrangements proposed by The People's Lottery subsequently been found to be incapable of implementation, there would have been no proposals within the final application to secure participants' interests. The Commission is required, under section 4(1)(b), to reject any bid where it is not satisfied that adequate arrangements have been made for the protection of the interests of every participant in the National Lottery. The Commission therefore had no alternative but to reject The People's Lottery's application on this ground. </p> <p>24. The Commission was satisfied that the player protection, including prize fund security, arrangements proposed by Camelot in its application were likely to ensure that the interests of every participant in the National Lottery are protected for the purposes of section 4(1)(b) of the 1993 Act. However, the Commission was concerned that the actions taken by GTech, and described in the section above, had run directly counter to participants' interests in that they had concealed a defect which impacted upon the calculation of the value of prizes due to individual prize-winners. </p> <p>25. Until the Commission can be satisfied that the propriety measures described in the foregoing section have been implemented and are effective, it cannot be satisfied that the protection of the interests of every participant in the National Lottery is most likely to be secured by the grant of a seven year licence to Camelot. </p> <p>PROSPECTIVE PROCEEDS FOR THE NATIONAL LOTTERY DISTRIBUTION FUND (\"NLDF\") 26. Subject to securing propriety and player protection, the Commission has a duty under section 4(2) of the 1993 Act to ensure that it does its best to secure that the net proceeds of the National Lottery are as great as possible. The arrangements adopted by the Commission provide for the return to the NLDF to be related to the level of sales generated by the licensee and this requires the Commission to be satisfied that the applicant can operate and remain viable at realistic sales levels. </p> <p>27. The Commission was concerned that both applicants appeared to be unduly optimistic about the level of sales that would be achieved over the licence period and considered that both applicants were unlikely to achieve a contribution of \u00a315 billion to the NLDF over the next licence period. It did not consider that an increase in sales over the new licence period as a whole of 43% (Camelot) or 44% (The People's Lottery) compared with the level over the most recent twelve months represented a viable principal forecast, given: - the difference in their central forecasts when compared with the returns achieved in the current licence period; - present sales trends; - the likely increase over the next licence period in the number of competitors to the National Lottery; and - regulatory concerns about certain of their game plans (as referred to in the game planning sections below). The Commission therefore concluded that likely revenue scenarios would fall significantly below the principal forecasts made by both the applicants. </p> <p>28. The Commission noted that The People's Lottery's application was more generous at equivalent sales levels than the bid submitted by Camelot. This led the Commission to conclude that this application might well have generated a better return for good causes had the Commission been able to accept it. </p> <p>Key issues - Camelot Financial soundness 29. The Commission was satisfied with the financial structure of Camelot and considered that its business plans remained robust in lower revenue scenarios. Role of gaming software supplier </p> <p>30. It was of significant concern to the Commission that Camelot could not presently demonstrate the ability to manage its gaming software supplier, GTech, effectively. The arrangements for managing GTech did not appear to have changed sufficiently on its move from shareholder to supplier to allow Camelot to exercise adequate control. Whilst changed arrangements are being implemented in response to the Commission's investigation into GTech's handling of software faults referred to earlier, these are not yet fully in place and do not yet satisfy the Commission's concerns as to the ability of Camelot to exert control at the most senior levels. </p> <p>31. The Commission considered that there was a risk that if Camelot and GTech failed on their commitments, further consideration would have to be given to terminating GTech's participation in running the National Lottery and to revoking the operator's licence. The Commission considered this to be an unacceptable risk to the return to the NLDF in the context of the award of a seven year licence to operate the National Lottery. </p> <p>New corporate structure 32. The Commission was also concerned at the potential impact of the changed corporate structure, with a holding company being put in place above Camelot and with CISL forming part of the same group. Following the improvements process, the Commission concluded that many of the issues had been addressed, but remained concerned that this structure would cause changed incentives within the group, potentially leading to situations where the interests of the holding company and other group companies run counter to the interests of the National Lottery. Such situations have the potential to impact badly on public confidence in Camelot and in the National Lottery more generally. </p> <p>Game planning 33. The Commission welcomed Camelot's proposals, but was not convinced that they would support the increases in sales predicted within the business plan, especially in respect of Instants. The Commission considered that the game strategy was credible overall. However, it was uncertain whether the Euro Bloc game (which was forecast to contribute 8% of total revenue forecast for the next licence period and 17% as a proportion of ticket sales in the last two years of the next licence period), whilst being an interesting proposal, would be capable of introduction within the proposed licence period. If this were not the case, it was not convinced that an alternative game which would match the revenues predicted for the Euro Bloc game could be introduced. </p> <p>Technological solutions and start-up 34. To a large extent, the reliability of Camelot's technological solutions has been demonstrated through the operation under the current licence from which its solutions would be evolved in a phased (and hence low risk) programme. Its new technology solutions (internet etc) appeared robust. Its transition plans were thorough and clear, and were capable of being delivered within the time-scale available and at little risk to the Lottery. </p> <p>Key issues - The People's Lottery Financial soundness 35. The Commission had significant concerns about the financial soundness viability of The People's Lottery in lower revenue scenarios - both in terms of available headroom in the early stages of the licence period and in terms of profitability over the licence period. It considered that these would also impact upon the ability of The People's Lottery to ensure that adequate funds were available to support prize security arrangements in the case of its failureinsolvency. The Commission noted the view of The People's Lottery that such low revenue scenarios were unlikely; however, the Commission could foresee that such scenarios were quite possible and wished therefore to be certain that, in such scenarios, The People's Lottery would remain viable. </p> <p>36. During the improvement process, The People's Lottery offered that, if further debt finance were required beyond its existing loan facilities - for instance because of unforeseen costs overruns, it would obtain an additional facility of \u00a350 million. The Commission considered that this arrangement would also address its concerns about the financial stability viability of The People's Lottery in lower revenue scenarios, so long as it could be certain that such funds would be clearly and unconditionally available to the People's Lottery throughout the licence period should they be required. In the event, The People's Lottery did not finalise provide an additional facility of \u00a350million. The Commission was therefore unable to conclude that sufficient finance was irrevocably committed in support of the application to ensure the financial stability of The People's Lottery in lower revenue scenarios. </p> <p>37. The Commission took the view that this conclusion was also relevant to the discharge of its duty under either or both of section 4(1)(a) of the 1993 Act (to exercise its section 5 function in the manner it considers the most likely to secure that the National Lottery is run with all due propriety) and section 4(1)(b) alluded to above. It could not be satisfied that these duties would be adequately discharged by letting a seven year licence to The People's Lottery given its view of the financial soundness viability issue. </p> <p>Game planning 38. The Commission welcomed the proposals for relaunch of the lottery and the invigoration of the game portfolio. It accepted that a change in matrix for the main on-line game could play an important part in this, so long as it was properly managed, and was pleased to see some innovative game proposals. It was not convinced that the regional game as proposed (which was forecast to contribute 6% of total revenue forecast for the next licence period) would be viable within existing legislation., but considered that this could have been the subject of further discussion and development. </p> <p>Technological solutions and start-up 39. The Commission was satisfied with The People's Lottery's technological solutions, which it considered credible and achievable to the required standards. The Commission was satisfied that the start-up plans, as updated through the improvements process, were thorough and clear and were capable of being delivered within the time-scale available. </p> <p>CONCLUSION 40. The Commission has been faced with a very difficult decision and has had to decide, with considerable reluctance, that: - neither of the applications it had received enabled it to conclude that it would, in accepting the application, be complying with its overriding statutory duties; and - it was unable to deal further in this process with either of the applicants without taking steps that would treat one or the other of them unfairly. </p> <p>41. The Commission therefore concluded that the only option available to it was to decide not to grant a section 5 licence to either of the applicants as a result of this process. The process laid down within the Invitation to Apply issued in November 1999 is therefore at an end and the Commission is considering, as a matter of urgency, how best it can meet its statutory responsibilities and grant a licence to operate the National Lottery with effect from 1 October 2001. </p>",

      "bodyText": "National Lottery Commission statement in full. 1. This written statement discharges the duty of the National Lottery Commission (\"the Commission\") under paragraph 9(2)(a) of Schedule 2A to the National Lottery etc Act 1993 (as amended)(\"the 1993 Act\"). That paragraph requires the National Lottery Commission to: \"arrange for the publication, in such manner as they think fit, of a written statement of their reasons - (a) for any decision which they may make to grant, or not to grant, to any particular applicant a licence under section 5.\" 2. On 15 August 2000, the National Lottery Commission decided, in response to the written applications that it had received from Camelot Group plc and The People's Lottery Ltd, not to grant a seven year licence under section 5 of the 1993 Act to either of the applicants following the Invitation to Apply process. 3. The process of evaluating the applications, which began with the submissions by the two applicants on 29 February 2000 of application documents in response to the Commission's Invitation to Apply, involved the Commission in: - evaluation of the originally submitted application documents; - evaluation of supplementary application documents submitted by both applicants in response to requests from the Commission for clarifications of and improvements to certain of the offered commitments; - receiving presentations from both applicants; - undertaking visits to sites relevant to the application. 4. In considering whether to grant a section 5 licence, the Commission considered the applications in the light both of the matters to which it must have regard by virtue of sections 4 and 5 of the 1993 Act and of the evaluation criteria set out in Chapter 4 of the Invitation to Apply. 5. The reasons for the Commission's decision are set out below. THE COMMISSION'S OVERRIDING DUTIES 6. The Commission has three overriding duties, which are set out in section 4 of the 1993 Act. That section requires that the Commission shall exercise its functions in the manner it: \"considers most likely to secure- (a) that the National Lottery is run, and every lottery that forms part of it is promoted, with all due propriety, and (b) that the interests of every participant in a lottery that forms part of the National Lottery are protected.\" Subject to these, the Commission shall: \"do its best to secure that the net proceeds of the National Lottery are as great as possible.\" 7. The Commission considered, having consulted widely, that it was most likely to meet these overriding duties in selecting the licensee for the next licence period by undertaking an open competition. It set out the terms of the competition in the Invitation to Apply, which it issued in November 1999 following extensive consultation. This provided the basis for the competition. 8. The Commission is required, under the terms of section 5(3) of the 1993 Act, to consider the applications that are made to it containing such information as it has specified (in this case in its Invitation to Apply). Whilst it can invite the applicants to clarify or improve that information, it can only do so in a manner which is fair to both applicants. It cannot itself add to, or go beyond, the information submitted in the applications in making its evaluation. It must be satisfied, in accepting an application, that its overriding duties will be met and it must, in the conduct of its evaluation, act entirely fairly between both applicants. ARRANGEMENTS TO SECURE THAT THE NATIONAL LOTTERY IS RUN WITH ALL DUE PROPRIETY AND APPLICANTS' FITNESS AND PROPRIETY 9. The Commission has an overriding responsibility under Section 4(1)(a) of the 1993 Act, which requires the Commission in determining the grant of any section 5 licence to be satisfied that the arrangements which are made are those most likely to secure that the National Lottery will be run with all due propriety. During the evaluation process, the Commission conducted an investigation which established that GTech, the supplier of lottery gaming systems to Camelot, had identified a software fault and had corrected that fault secretly, in breach of established software change control procedures and without disclosing it to Camelot or the Commission's predecessor, OFLOT. The fault had been in place since the beginning of the lottery and was successfully rectified on 27 July 1998. In certain limited circumstances, it caused duplicate transactions to be recorded on the gaming systems, with only a single ticket being produced. This resulted in an overcharge to retailers and, if the ticket were a prize-winner, distortion errors in the distribution of the prize fund for between the prize-winners of the draw . 10. The decision by GTech to take this course of action to correct the fault secretly was taken personally by the former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, at a meeting at which the former President and Chief Operating Officer was also present. The decision was taken against written advice from the General Manager of Gtech UK that Camelot and OFLOT should be told. The GTech Board was not informed then or subsequently, until the matter was raised with them by the Commission. 11. One consequence of this decision was that no action could be taken to check the impact upon prize-winners and retailers, and make arrangements for restitution where appropriate. Hence, the integrity of the lottery was compromised. The former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer was aware of this consequence at the time that the decision was taken. 12. In response to the Commission's investigation, a number of measures were taken by GTech and further measures were proposed by both GTech and Camelot. These can be summarised as follows: 13. GTech: has changed its Board structure. The individuals involved in the decision not to notify Camelot or OFLOT of the problem, and its subsequent resolution, have left GTech. The posts of Chairman and Chief Executive have been permanently separated, and it is proposed that the membership and structure of the Board will be strengthened. has created a new committee of the Board - the Compliance and Corporate Governance Committee - which will oversee the proper handling and resolution of ethical issues, including the handling of software problems. It will be made up of non- executives and the Vice-President of Compliance will report directly to it. Its Chairman will provide an annual certificate to Camelot and the Commission, and will meet Camelot's Chairman on a regular basis. will review its Code of Conduct fully, and will also review arrangements for monitoring compliance with the Code. The Chairman and the Board will actively promote the Code and emphasise the need to comply with it under all circumstances. has agreed to the appointment of a dedicated account manager within GTech responsible for the Camelot account and with access to the Board. will have independent reviews undertaken of all its software development processes and process documentation, which will be made available to Camelot and the Commission. GTech will obtain certification against a number of international industry standards. Compliance with these procedures will be independently audited and certified to Camelot and the Commission annually. 14. Camelot: - will extend the scope of its reviews of GTech's performance. - will appoint a quality assurance/IT specialist to work full-time alongside GTech's quality assurance department. - will improve its arrangements for management of suppliers and control over the software development life cycle. - will ensure delivery of the above undertakings by itself and GTech through revised contract terms and additional licence conditions. - 15. The Commission is now considering separately the issue of breaches by Camelot of the terms of the existing licence arising from the software incident, both in relation to change control procedures and record keeping obligations. 16. Generally the Commission remains extremely concerned about the behaviour of GTech, which would again, if Camelot's application were accepted, be a key supplier on whom Camelot places considerable reliance. The senior executives who participated in the decision to take the course of action set out above had, following the departure of the previous Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, given personal assurances to the Director General of the National Lottery that GTech would introduce and rigorously apply a Code of Conduct intended to enforce proper corporate behaviour . Their decision, which contravened the newly implemented Code of Conduct, was taken three months after those assurances were given and was not disclosed within GTECH in further contravention of the Code. The Commission has therefore decided to review in November 2000 the adequacy of the revised propriety arrangements which have been or are to be put in place by both GTech and Camelot. 17. The Commission has an overriding duty under section 4(1)(a) of the 1993 Act to be satisfied in granting any section 5 licence that the arrangements which are made are those most likely to secure that the National Lottery will be run with all due propriety. The Commission has as yet unresolved concerns about the future long term propriety of the arrangements made within GTech and between GTech and Camelot to ensure that the National Lottery regulator's fit and proper person jurisdiction in the context of licence revocation is not invoked again. These concerns have led it to conclude that it cannot presently be certain that the outstanding measures offered will be implemented in full and will have the necessary impact on GTech's culture and conduct so as to ensure propriety over the life of a seven year licence. It will not be in a position to judge further within what timescale propriety can be demonstrated in respect of the previous licence until, at the earliest, the conclusion of its November review. The Commission has therefore concluded that it cannot, at this stage, be satisfied that a grant of a seven year section 5 licence to Camelot would be consistent with the discharge of its overriding duty under section 4(1)(a) of the 1993 Act. The individuals responsible for the decision have now left GTech and the Commission has received full assistance and a range of undertakings from the GTech and Camelot boards which should, if fully and effectively implemented, prevent a reoccurrence of the unacceptable behaviour demonstrated in this case. On this basis, and having taken legal advice, the Commission decided not to proceed with a determination that GTech is not presently or would not in future be a fit and proper person to manage part of the business of running the National Lottery for the purposes respectively of sections 10(3) and 5(5) of the 1993 Act. However, the Commission remains extremely concerned at the conduct of GTech's senior executives. The senior executives who participated in the decision to take the course of action set out above had, following the departure of the previous Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, given personal assurances to the Director-General of the National Lottery that GTech would introduce and rigorously apply a code of conduct intended to enforce proper corporate behaviour. The decision, which contravened the newly implemented code of conduct, was taken three months after those assurances were given and was not disclosed within GTech in further contravention of the code. Given these concerns, the Commission has concluded that it could not be certain, at the time of its decision on the award of the section 5 licence, that the assurances that the boards of Camelot and GTech have given would be implemented in full and would have the necessary impact upon GTech's culture and conduct so as to ensure propriety over the life of a seven year licence. The proposals could well have that effect, but they were not yet sufficiently in place and operational to be capable of evaluation. The Commission therefore decided that, given the inability of both GTech's board and Camelot to ensure proper behaviour by GTech's most senior executives in the past, it could not presently be satisfied that the arrangements proposed by Camelot were sufficiently likely to secure that the National Lottery would be run with all due propriety for it to accept Camelot's application and award it a seven year licence. 18. The Commission was satisfied that The People's Lottery is a fit and proper body to run the National Lottery for the purposes of section 5(4) of the 1993 Act. ARRANGEMENTS TO SECURE THAT THE INTERESTS OF EVERY PARTICIPANT IN A LOTTERY THAT FORMS PART OF THE NATIONAL LOTTERY ARE PROTECTED 19. The Commission has an overriding responsibility, under Section 4(1)(b) of the 1993 Act, which requires the Commission in determining the grant of any section 5 licence, to ensure that the interests of every participant in a lottery that forms part of the National Lottery are protected. 20. The Commission considers that it is required, under section 4(1)(b), to reject any bid where it is not satisfied that adequate arrangements have been made for the protection of the interests of every participant in the National Lottery. This includes arrangements to ensure that all prize-winners will receive the prizes due to them and that any holders of tickets in a draw which does not, for any reason, take place receive full reimbursement of the cost of the ticket. These arrangements must have full effect in all circumstances, including revocation of the Section 5 licence and the failure, by way of insolvency or otherwise, of the operator. 21. The Commission considers that, in order for it to be satisfied that adequate arrangements have been made for the protection of the interests of every participant in the National Lottery, an application must contain unequivocal commitments which are clearly capable of being put into effect both legally and practically, which are not contingent on the agreement of any other party, and which will secure in full the interests of players. 22. The People's Lottery introduced a new proposal for the protection of the interests of players in the improvements it submitted to the Commission on 17 July 2000 as part of its application. It adopted these new proposals as its final submission in its clarificatory letter of 31 July 2000. The new proposals were clearly conditional and involved significant legal uncertainties. They stated, for example, that any assignment (of 50% of proceeds of ticket sales) would be conditional upon satisfactory resolution of any stamp duty and asset transfer issues arising and that opinions from Counsel about the robustness of the prize payment security structure proposed would be required. 23. The Commission concluded, having received legal advice, that the arrangements proposed were so conditional and uncertain that they were not capable of acceptance. Neither could it be satisfied that the application was likely to secure that the interests of every participant in a lottery that forms part of the National Lottery would be protected. Had the arrangements proposed by The People's Lottery subsequently been found to be incapable of implementation, there would have been no proposals within the final application to secure participants' interests. The Commission is required, under section 4(1)(b), to reject any bid where it is not satisfied that adequate arrangements have been made for the protection of the interests of every participant in the National Lottery. The Commission therefore had no alternative but to reject The People's Lottery's application on this ground. 24. The Commission was satisfied that the player protection, including prize fund security, arrangements proposed by Camelot in its application were likely to ensure that the interests of every participant in the National Lottery are protected for the purposes of section 4(1)(b) of the 1993 Act. However, the Commission was concerned that the actions taken by GTech, and described in the section above, had run directly counter to participants' interests in that they had concealed a defect which impacted upon the calculation of the value of prizes due to individual prize-winners. 25. Until the Commission can be satisfied that the propriety measures described in the foregoing section have been implemented and are effective, it cannot be satisfied that the protection of the interests of every participant in the National Lottery is most likely to be secured by the grant of a seven year licence to Camelot. PROSPECTIVE PROCEEDS FOR THE NATIONAL LOTTERY DISTRIBUTION FUND (\"NLDF\") 26. Subject to securing propriety and player protection, the Commission has a duty under section 4(2) of the 1993 Act to ensure that it does its best to secure that the net proceeds of the National Lottery are as great as possible. The arrangements adopted by the Commission provide for the return to the NLDF to be related to the level of sales generated by the licensee and this requires the Commission to be satisfied that the applicant can operate and remain viable at realistic sales levels. 27. The Commission was concerned that both applicants appeared to be unduly optimistic about the level of sales that would be achieved over the licence period and considered that both applicants were unlikely to achieve a contribution of \u00a315 billion to the NLDF over the next licence period. It did not consider that an increase in sales over the new licence period as a whole of 43% (Camelot) or 44% (The People's Lottery) compared with the level over the most recent twelve months represented a viable principal forecast, given: - the difference in their central forecasts when compared with the returns achieved in the current licence period; - present sales trends; - the likely increase over the next licence period in the number of competitors to the National Lottery; and - regulatory concerns about certain of their game plans (as referred to in the game planning sections below). The Commission therefore concluded that likely revenue scenarios would fall significantly below the principal forecasts made by both the applicants. 28. The Commission noted that The People's Lottery's application was more generous at equivalent sales levels than the bid submitted by Camelot. This led the Commission to conclude that this application might well have generated a better return for good causes had the Commission been able to accept it. Key issues - Camelot Financial soundness 29. The Commission was satisfied with the financial structure of Camelot and considered that its business plans remained robust in lower revenue scenarios. Role of gaming software supplier 30. It was of significant concern to the Commission that Camelot could not presently demonstrate the ability to manage its gaming software supplier, GTech, effectively. The arrangements for managing GTech did not appear to have changed sufficiently on its move from shareholder to supplier to allow Camelot to exercise adequate control. Whilst changed arrangements are being implemented in response to the Commission's investigation into GTech's handling of software faults referred to earlier, these are not yet fully in place and do not yet satisfy the Commission's concerns as to the ability of Camelot to exert control at the most senior levels. 31. The Commission considered that there was a risk that if Camelot and GTech failed on their commitments, further consideration would have to be given to terminating GTech's participation in running the National Lottery and to revoking the operator's licence. The Commission considered this to be an unacceptable risk to the return to the NLDF in the context of the award of a seven year licence to operate the National Lottery. New corporate structure 32. The Commission was also concerned at the potential impact of the changed corporate structure, with a holding company being put in place above Camelot and with CISL forming part of the same group. Following the improvements process, the Commission concluded that many of the issues had been addressed, but remained concerned that this structure would cause changed incentives within the group, potentially leading to situations where the interests of the holding company and other group companies run counter to the interests of the National Lottery. Such situations have the potential to impact badly on public confidence in Camelot and in the National Lottery more generally. Game planning 33. The Commission welcomed Camelot's proposals, but was not convinced that they would support the increases in sales predicted within the business plan, especially in respect of Instants. The Commission considered that the game strategy was credible overall. However, it was uncertain whether the Euro Bloc game (which was forecast to contribute 8% of total revenue forecast for the next licence period and 17% as a proportion of ticket sales in the last two years of the next licence period), whilst being an interesting proposal, would be capable of introduction within the proposed licence period. If this were not the case, it was not convinced that an alternative game which would match the revenues predicted for the Euro Bloc game could be introduced. Technological solutions and start-up 34. To a large extent, the reliability of Camelot's technological solutions has been demonstrated through the operation under the current licence from which its solutions would be evolved in a phased (and hence low risk) programme. Its new technology solutions (internet etc) appeared robust. Its transition plans were thorough and clear, and were capable of being delivered within the time-scale available and at little risk to the Lottery. Key issues - The People's Lottery Financial soundness 35. The Commission had significant concerns about the financial soundness viability of The People's Lottery in lower revenue scenarios - both in terms of available headroom in the early stages of the licence period and in terms of profitability over the licence period. It considered that these would also impact upon the ability of The People's Lottery to ensure that adequate funds were available to support prize security arrangements in the case of its failureinsolvency. The Commission noted the view of The People's Lottery that such low revenue scenarios were unlikely; however, the Commission could foresee that such scenarios were quite possible and wished therefore to be certain that, in such scenarios, The People's Lottery would remain viable. 36. During the improvement process, The People's Lottery offered that, if further debt finance were required beyond its existing loan facilities - for instance because of unforeseen costs overruns, it would obtain an additional facility of \u00a350 million. The Commission considered that this arrangement would also address its concerns about the financial stability viability of The People's Lottery in lower revenue scenarios, so long as it could be certain that such funds would be clearly and unconditionally available to the People's Lottery throughout the licence period should they be required. In the event, The People's Lottery did not finalise provide an additional facility of \u00a350million. The Commission was therefore unable to conclude that sufficient finance was irrevocably committed in support of the application to ensure the financial stability of The People's Lottery in lower revenue scenarios. 37. The Commission took the view that this conclusion was also relevant to the discharge of its duty under either or both of section 4(1)(a) of the 1993 Act (to exercise its section 5 function in the manner it considers the most likely to secure that the National Lottery is run with all due propriety) and section 4(1)(b) alluded to above. It could not be satisfied that these duties would be adequately discharged by letting a seven year licence to The People's Lottery given its view of the financial soundness viability issue. Game planning 38. The Commission welcomed the proposals for relaunch of the lottery and the invigoration of the game portfolio. It accepted that a change in matrix for the main on-line game could play an important part in this, so long as it was properly managed, and was pleased to see some innovative game proposals. It was not convinced that the regional game as proposed (which was forecast to contribute 6% of total revenue forecast for the next licence period) would be viable within existing legislation., but considered that this could have been the subject of further discussion and development. Technological solutions and start-up 39. The Commission was satisfied with The People's Lottery's technological solutions, which it considered credible and achievable to the required standards. The Commission was satisfied that the start-up plans, as updated through the improvements process, were thorough and clear and were capable of being delivered within the time-scale available. CONCLUSION 40. The Commission has been faced with a very difficult decision and has had to decide, with considerable reluctance, that: - neither of the applications it had received enabled it to conclude that it would, in accepting the application, be complying with its overriding statutory duties; and - it was unable to deal further in this process with either of the applicants without taking steps that would treat one or the other of them unfairly. 41. The Commission therefore concluded that the only option available to it was to decide not to grant a section 5 licence to either of the applicants as a result of this process. The process laid down within the Invitation to Apply issued in November 1999 is therefore at an end and the Commission is considering, as a matter of urgency, how best it can meet its statutory responsibilities and grant a licence to operate the National Lottery with effect from 1 October 2001.",

      "body": "<p>After the actress Caroline Quentin decided to have a second child within a year of the first, she probably did not spend much time wondering what the world would think of her. She may even have assumed that it was no one's business but her own. If she has been reading her own press this week, she will know by now how wrong she was. </p> <p>It's not just short gaps that make people gasp these days. Very long Blair-size gaps raise just as many eyebrows, as does the decision to sidestep the problem and stop at one child. Even medium-sized gaps of two or three years between children are controversial these days, if you end up with more than two or three children. </p> <p>So the golden rule is: whatever you decide, someone very close to you is sure you'll live to regret it. Even worse, this malevolent person will be able to taunt you with science. This is thanks to a renewed interest among psychologists and medical researchers in \"birth-spacing\". Taken together, the results are inconclusive, which means that every good reason to choose a particular sort of gap will be counterbalanced with just as good a reason not to. </p> <p>Often, such studies will just make you wonder why you started a family in the first place. Here, for example, are the research world's odds on close spacing as summed up in a recent review by the psychiatrist Dr Raj Persaud. It is a good idea, it seems, if you want a peaceful household, because siblings who are less than two years apart in age are \"happier\" than siblings born more than three years apart. The experts think this may be because the older child will be too young at the time of the second one's birth to have enjoyed the undivided attention of his parents, and so will be outraged at the prospect of having to share it. Such children are more likely to become playmates, and so will not suffer from loneliness. </p> <p>However, narrow spacing can lead to a fractious household - it is much harder to look after two toddlers than one. Parents of closely spaced children are more likely to be disciplinarians. They have less 'time to give any particular child undivided attention, and this deficit can have devastating long-term effects. One study has shown that siblings born within two years are 50% more likely to drop out of education. </p> <p>However, the picture is not quite so grim for the elder child; those with siblings less than two years younger have been found to be very ambitious and competitive. </p> <p>The composite scenario for longer gaps is, if anything, even more perplexing. Things tend to be more relaxed in the medium-gap family because the parents will have had enough time to get used to the \"complex inter-relationships\" in their slowly growing \"family constellation\". But although they report more positive relationships with their parents, the children will be less happy in themselves and a great deal more jealous of each other. The younger ones may become so discouraged by having to live in their older siblings' shadow that they decide to give up on competition altogether. </p> <p>But if the gap is very wide, in other words, five years or more, jealousy becomes less of a problem. Not only has each child had a chance to enjoy long stretches of undivided attention: he or she will also be operating in a separate social sphere. This means that they cannot lean on each other they way children closer in age often do. Because they have to learn to stand on their own two feet, they end up scoring higher in confidence tests. Which is not the same thing as scoring high in an IQ test. </p> <p>Youngest children tend to score lower in IQ tests and some experts think this might be because older siblings increase their own IQs by becoming their younger brothers and sisters' teachers. Which must mean that IQ tests measure learned as well as innate intelligence. </p> <p>As many of the experts will themselves admit, the gap between children is only one factor among many to consider. A household is a complex organism. Different sorts of personalities act with and against each other in different, often unquantifiable, ways. </p> <p>Some of the studies mentioned here offer interesting insights but the finding that is really useful comes from a 1999 US study by Dr Bao-Ping Zhu, of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia. After looking at 173,205 births in Utah between 1989 and 1996, he found that women who wait between 18 and 23 months after the birth of one child before conceiving another were most likely to have healthy, full-term babies. If they conceived sooner, they had a 30-40% chance of premature or underweight babies - probably because of vitamin depletion, blood loss, reproductive system damage and fatigue. However, if they conceived between 18 and 23 months after the first birth, the women had a chance to recover from all of the above, while still enjoying some benefits of the first pregnancy - for example, an enlarged uterus and increased blood flow to the womb. </p> <p>After 23 months, the odds began to work against the women. If they delayed pregnancy by, say, 10 years, they were 50% more likely to deliver prematurely. But what is the most important factor - the spacing of pregnancies or the mother's age? </p> <p>When this study was first published in the New England Journal of Medicine, Dr Mark A Klebanoff, of the National Institutes of Health, warned that the researchers may not have paid enough attention to other possible factors like chronic health problems, miscarriages or abortions. </p> <p>As important as such studies are, the findings may not be relevant to women who are well-nourished, well-educated and healthy. And because they are health studies, they tend to ignore all those social and personal factors that all parents have to consider. </p> <p>Let's begin with age. In your 20s (if you're well-nourished and educated and middle-class and British), you can probably afford to sit around for years fretting about the right gap. If, like Quentin, you're 38, you really can't sit back with a yawn and say: 'Not now, darling, ask me again in five years.' </p> <p>Having been lectured about the risks associated with \"old eggs\" you will be inclined to think that perhaps the best thing is to have your children quickly. And if it was difficult to conceive the first time, the question will be not when to have a second child, but whether you can. </p> <p>Then there's the money question. Can you afford to take time off work? What is your employer going to think if you return from one maternity leave only to announce that you're about to leave on another? </p> <p>It might be against the law to sack you for spacing your children more closely than your employer thinks is right, but it's rarely a wise career move. </p> <p>And what if you have had one child with someone, and then split up? What if the next child you have is with another man? Sibling gaps in \"original families\" have little in common with sibling gaps involving more than one father, or indeed, more than one mother. Generic indicators that were only intermittently helpful in families where all children share the same parents, become almost laughable in Stepfamily Land. Because if (like me) you have two sets of older children, each travelling at different times between two different houses, and a set of younger children always resident in the house in the middle, there are so many variables at work that you will be doing advanced maths just to set the table. </p> <p>This may explain why birthspacing research has, for the most part, shied away from the challenge. Sometimes I wish I had done the same. But what's done is done. If I had to do it all over again? I would want to space my children a little more intelligently. </p> <p>Instead of jumping in at the deep end, I would want to ask myself how strong I felt, and how much money and help I could really count on from others. It would help to know that the ideal gap from the medical point of view is 18 to 23 months, that breast-feeding does not stop you getting pregnant, and that \"accidents\" are a lot more common that people like to admit; one out of every three babies born in this country is \"unintended\". But even when you know all this, you still know next to nothing. Planned parenthood is a beautiful thing to aspire to, but you still can't get pregnant without rolling the dice.</p>",

      "bodyText": "After the actress Caroline Quentin decided to have a second child within a year of the first, she probably did not spend much time wondering what the world would think of her. She may even have assumed that it was no one's business but her own. If she has been reading her own press this week, she will know by now how wrong she was. It's not just short gaps that make people gasp these days. Very long Blair-size gaps raise just as many eyebrows, as does the decision to sidestep the problem and stop at one child. Even medium-sized gaps of two or three years between children are controversial these days, if you end up with more than two or three children. So the golden rule is: whatever you decide, someone very close to you is sure you'll live to regret it. Even worse, this malevolent person will be able to taunt you with science. This is thanks to a renewed interest among psychologists and medical researchers in \"birth-spacing\". Taken together, the results are inconclusive, which means that every good reason to choose a particular sort of gap will be counterbalanced with just as good a reason not to. Often, such studies will just make you wonder why you started a family in the first place. Here, for example, are the research world's odds on close spacing as summed up in a recent review by the psychiatrist Dr Raj Persaud. It is a good idea, it seems, if you want a peaceful household, because siblings who are less than two years apart in age are \"happier\" than siblings born more than three years apart. The experts think this may be because the older child will be too young at the time of the second one's birth to have enjoyed the undivided attention of his parents, and so will be outraged at the prospect of having to share it. Such children are more likely to become playmates, and so will not suffer from loneliness. However, narrow spacing can lead to a fractious household - it is much harder to look after two toddlers than one. Parents of closely spaced children are more likely to be disciplinarians. They have less 'time to give any particular child undivided attention, and this deficit can have devastating long-term effects. One study has shown that siblings born within two years are 50% more likely to drop out of education. However, the picture is not quite so grim for the elder child; those with siblings less than two years younger have been found to be very ambitious and competitive. The composite scenario for longer gaps is, if anything, even more perplexing. Things tend to be more relaxed in the medium-gap family because the parents will have had enough time to get used to the \"complex inter-relationships\" in their slowly growing \"family constellation\". But although they report more positive relationships with their parents, the children will be less happy in themselves and a great deal more jealous of each other. The younger ones may become so discouraged by having to live in their older siblings' shadow that they decide to give up on competition altogether. But if the gap is very wide, in other words, five years or more, jealousy becomes less of a problem. Not only has each child had a chance to enjoy long stretches of undivided attention: he or she will also be operating in a separate social sphere. This means that they cannot lean on each other they way children closer in age often do. Because they have to learn to stand on their own two feet, they end up scoring higher in confidence tests. Which is not the same thing as scoring high in an IQ test. Youngest children tend to score lower in IQ tests and some experts think this might be because older siblings increase their own IQs by becoming their younger brothers and sisters' teachers. Which must mean that IQ tests measure learned as well as innate intelligence. As many of the experts will themselves admit, the gap between children is only one factor among many to consider. A household is a complex organism. Different sorts of personalities act with and against each other in different, often unquantifiable, ways. Some of the studies mentioned here offer interesting insights but the finding that is really useful comes from a 1999 US study by Dr Bao-Ping Zhu, of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia. After looking at 173,205 births in Utah between 1989 and 1996, he found that women who wait between 18 and 23 months after the birth of one child before conceiving another were most likely to have healthy, full-term babies. If they conceived sooner, they had a 30-40% chance of premature or underweight babies - probably because of vitamin depletion, blood loss, reproductive system damage and fatigue. However, if they conceived between 18 and 23 months after the first birth, the women had a chance to recover from all of the above, while still enjoying some benefits of the first pregnancy - for example, an enlarged uterus and increased blood flow to the womb. After 23 months, the odds began to work against the women. If they delayed pregnancy by, say, 10 years, they were 50% more likely to deliver prematurely. But what is the most important factor - the spacing of pregnancies or the mother's age? When this study was first published in the New England Journal of Medicine, Dr Mark A Klebanoff, of the National Institutes of Health, warned that the researchers may not have paid enough attention to other possible factors like chronic health problems, miscarriages or abortions. As important as such studies are, the findings may not be relevant to women who are well-nourished, well-educated and healthy. And because they are health studies, they tend to ignore all those social and personal factors that all parents have to consider. Let's begin with age. In your 20s (if you're well-nourished and educated and middle-class and British), you can probably afford to sit around for years fretting about the right gap. If, like Quentin, you're 38, you really can't sit back with a yawn and say: 'Not now, darling, ask me again in five years.' Having been lectured about the risks associated with \"old eggs\" you will be inclined to think that perhaps the best thing is to have your children quickly. And if it was difficult to conceive the first time, the question will be not when to have a second child, but whether you can. Then there's the money question. Can you afford to take time off work? What is your employer going to think if you return from one maternity leave only to announce that you're about to leave on another? It might be against the law to sack you for spacing your children more closely than your employer thinks is right, but it's rarely a wise career move. And what if you have had one child with someone, and then split up? What if the next child you have is with another man? Sibling gaps in \"original families\" have little in common with sibling gaps involving more than one father, or indeed, more than one mother. Generic indicators that were only intermittently helpful in families where all children share the same parents, become almost laughable in Stepfamily Land. Because if (like me) you have two sets of older children, each travelling at different times between two different houses, and a set of younger children always resident in the house in the middle, there are so many variables at work that you will be doing advanced maths just to set the table. This may explain why birthspacing research has, for the most part, shied away from the challenge. Sometimes I wish I had done the same. But what's done is done. If I had to do it all over again? I would want to space my children a little more intelligently. Instead of jumping in at the deep end, I would want to ask myself how strong I felt, and how much money and help I could really count on from others. It would help to know that the ideal gap from the medical point of view is 18 to 23 months, that breast-feeding does not stop you getting pregnant, and that \"accidents\" are a lot more common that people like to admit; one out of every three babies born in this country is \"unintended\". But even when you know all this, you still know next to nothing. Planned parenthood is a beautiful thing to aspire to, but you still can't get pregnant without rolling the dice.",

By the time it was realised that she needed to be taken home the other mothers had gone, and the staff were desperate for a volunteer. Why not me? </p> <p>As a lecturer with no classes that day, I had time. I offered, and there was consternation. A man had never done mother's duty before.

A man had done play-school duty and after that I did it regularly. So did others: Ben, a fireman on shifts. And 19-year-old Matthew, from Manchester, who had come down to stay with his uncle to escape unemployment. He quickly became the idol of the local girls with his big city ways. The mothers loved him too, for with no money he was always ready to do one of their volunteer duties for a couple of quid. </p> <p>And the kids appreciated it. Against a fireman and the local Romeo, a young lecturer didn't count for much but we were all men in a previously female world. </p> <p>But how many of us are there today? Would any of us do it again? And are we wanted? For the finger of suspicion is out. That playgroup has gone but the new one still needs volunteers. They are usually women. </p> <p>The rules are strict. The Children's Act, they tell the volunteers, insists that only full-timers take the children to the loo. It doesn't, of course, but that is not the point. It's easier that way. </p> <p>The discomfort I feel is real and I am not alone. Taking my son and his friends to a local water park we are drawn to the rapids where powerful jets throw you around in a jumble of bodies. It's all right to be there with your children but do you go in alone? </p> <p>I look around. This is a macho place for men to bring their kids. The men are up there on the water slides, hanging from the swinging ropes, showing off to one another - their kids playing somewhere else. But in the rapids with its jumble of bodies there are no men on their own. </p> <p>Jeffrey, a student of mine, is a pensioner whose wife died some time ago and now he is looking forward to the summer. His granddaughter is coming to stay for the first time. \"It's OK,\" he says. \"Her mother trusts her with me, I'm her grandfather.\" It seems best not to offend his dignity by asking what he means. The meaning is clear in that phrase, \"I'm her grandfather.\" </p> <p>Henry is not so savvy. He is in his early 80s and walks with difficulty. His delight is to sit outside his house on a warm day and tease the local primary school children on their way home, and offer them sweets. Not all of them like it but Henry is well known in the street. He is less well known in the centre of town to which he can sometimes struggle. </p> <p>In the newsagent I see him teasing an adolescent girl from a nearby street. \"Dirty old man,\" a young mother says under her breath as she pays for her newspaper. Then, to her horror, Henry turns and offers her young daughter a sweet. As the child's hand reaches out the mother pulls it away. \"I've told you not to take anything from strangers,\" she yells. Henry stands there looking bewildered. The middle-aged shop assistant who knows him well calls out: \"It's Henry, he won't hurt her.\" But it's too late. The child, now crying, is dragged out of the door. </p> <p>My sister-in-law tells me about a young male trainee primary school teacher - a diminishing breed. He has to take a class to swimming lessons and is talking about getting in the pool with them. But she and the other women teachers are advising him against it. Don't put yourself in that position, she says. But just by wanting to work with primary school children he is vulnerable to gossip. </p> <p>I have seen it with Paul. He teaches at the local primary school where he is one of two male staff. The other is the head. To be a man and a head is OK - it's what you are there for and, in any case, he is married. But Paul is not and he is middle-aged. He is not the greatest teacher but the kids love him. They are desperate to be in his class. Mine were. And most of the parents like him too. </p> <p>But for some there is that question: why does a man want to spend his life working with very young children? I hope that he never hears their malicious gossip but he is experienced. He probably understands and he knows the situations to avoid. </p> <p>Not so John, he has to learn. His wife is about to give birth and he is talking to Steve. They are both middle class, both in education. Steve is young, too, but already has three children aged 10, six and two. Does he feel any different about being a father today? He is, he says, much more conscious of the way he behaves with the youngest than he was with the eldest. \"Do you do things like have a bath with them?\" asks John. \"I used to,\" says Steve. </p> <p>Then there's the moment when you're on the beach and you see a small child running across it crying and obviously lost. No one else seems to notice but you do. What do you do? You know the stereotype. The child is crying and somewhere there is a frantic mother and perhaps an angry father panicking over whether the child is lost or been taken. </p> <p>It would be so easy to take the child by the hand and guide it back to safety. But you are a man alone, half-undressed on a lonely beach. Do you get up and risk it or do you close your ears? Do you let someone else solve the problem? Would that be so wrong? As the moral panic grows, men are voting with their feet. It's not something that is often talked about. There is no need. It is there in the nuance of the conversation, in the inaction, in the distance you keep. It's simpler that way. No misunderstandings. Let the women do it - it's their work.</p>",

The rest of the time, they're strapped into the Peugeot (French song tape playing, of course), since the courses are all some distance from each other and finish at different times.

I love the holidays precisely because there's nothing to do. As my three chuck their ratty grey uniforms in the laundry basket at the end of term, you can almost see their little bodies sigh and relax. No more schedules or structure.

My friend Katie was unnerved when I told her the plan: \"But what ... no outings?\" \"We've been on holiday,\" I said, \"Now they can play.\" She looked at me as if \"play\" meant burying your kids up to the neck in sand. \"What will they do all day?\" \"Play,\" I said again. \"Hang out.\" \"But what about stimulation? Exercise?\" \"We walk the dog on the common,\" I told her, but you could see that she didn't like it. You could see that she thought we were failing our children in some vital, terrible way. Her four (even the youngest, who is barely five) all do courses. Violin, judo, pottery, tap-dancing, pond-dipping. The rest of the time, they're strapped into the Peugeot (French song tape playing, of course), since the courses are all some distance from each other and finish at different times. Last week when she called in for tea having collected all but the last child, she admitted she was exhausted. \"I'll be glad when the holidays are over,\" she sighed, \"Still, at least they're not bored.\" I don't get it. I love the holidays precisely because there's nothing to do. As my three chuck their ratty grey uniforms in the laundry basket at the end of term, you can almost see their little bodies sigh and relax. No more schedules or structure. What are today's parents so scared of? Why do they feel that they are failing their kids if they don't provide them with a minute-by-minute, fun-packed itinerary? What's wrong with not knowing what's going to happen next? Don't the best fun and games come about when you just let time go baggy on you? Come to that, what's wrong with doing nothing? How, if you have a kit for this and a course for that, will you ever have an original idea of your own? Would the Bront\u00ebs have been so creative if they'd been strapped into a Volvo for half the day going to music and movement classes?",

However, the commission chair, Dame Helena Shovelton, said the licence would be given to the People's Lottery if within a month it came up with a system that would protect \"all players, all the time\". As for Camelot, Dame Helena said the commission's confidence had been shaken by software problems and \"propriety issues\" related to lottery equipment supplied by Gtech. MPs have questioned GTech's fitness to be involved in running the lottery amid allegations about the way the firm obtained lottery licences in the US. The People's Lottery has pledged to create 2,500 new millionaires and raise more than \u00a315bn - the entire profits - for good causes. The game under Virgin tycoon Sir Richard would require participants to select six balls out of 53 instead of the present 49, meaning there would be fewer winners but bigger prizes. Sir Richard has fought hard for Camelot's prize. Despite being newly knighted for \"services to entrepreneurship\" and worth an estimated \u00a32.4bn, running the lottery has remained his overriding ambition. Today's announcement makes it likely that he will claim the lottery licence, provided his team can meet the commission's concerns. Camelot had pledged to cut the salaries and bonuses paid to directors and give a greater share of its profits to good causes amid criticism of its \"fat-cat\" payments to top executives. Had it secured a second term as National Lottery operator, it said it would have given more than \u00a315bn to good causes. Camelot's failed bid also included at least four new online games, investigation of the possibility of an international lottery, and a \u00a31bn investment in technology to allow people to play via the internet, mobile phones and interactive television by 2002. Before today's announcement, the Right Rev Richard Harris, Bishop of Oxford and chairman of the church's board of social responsibility, criticised the lottery for creating a fantasy world of escape for many of Britain's poorest people. \"The very fact that we have a lottery, I think, is a sign of social malaise - the fact that things in our society are not as they ought to be,\" he said. I think it distracts us from facing up to the kind of society we have now and the kind of society we ought to have.\" In a year when pay for Britain's top executives went up by 16% while the number of people living in poverty grew, society needed to take stock and re-evaluate its priorities, Bishop Harris went on. The bishop added that he would like the lottery to be scrapped, but if that was not possible the operators should give more prizes of a lower value rather than huge single-win rollover jackpots.

The National Autistic Association (NAS) estimates that 518,000 people in Britain may be affected by autistic spectrum disorders. Many, perhaps most, of the 403,000 with IQs over 70, will become semi- or fully independent as adults, but need understanding and help as children, according to the NAS. Almost all of the remaining 115,000 will require a high level of support throughout their lives. Figures globally are in the region of 91 people in 10,000. </p> <p>The autistic community of parents and affected people throughout the world keeps closely in touch, using the internet extensively to exchange information and provide encouragement. Janine Albury Thomson in New Zealand was one parent who lacked this support. She strangled her daughter in 1997 after the pressure became too much for her to bear. The killing of 17-year-old Casey Albury is regarded as a crucial case by the autistic community because the evidence clearly articulated the mother's state of mind. It was not reported in the British press. </p> <p>Casey was on holiday from her special boarding school. On the day she died, her mother recalled how she wouldn't stop repeating: \"The sun is rising\". Weary from stress and lack of sleep, Albury Thomson cracked. She told the jury that she took Casey to a bridge. She \"foolishly expected her to climb up and throw herself off\" [the parapet]. Casey, with the reduced ability to communicate of a low-functioning autistic, refused saying: \"cold\". Albury Thomson drove Casey to a quiet street and used the girl's dressing-gown belt as a ligature. \"I wrapped it round her neck and pulled. Then I wrapped it around and pulled again and then again, all in different directions and kept thinking this isn't happening quickly enough. </p> <p>\"She was a misfit. People were scared of her because she was different... I wish it could have been quicker. I'd wanted to kill her for a long time. She didn't die quickly, and I held on tight . . . saying 'Let go, for God's sake, let go'... and telling her that I loved her. I wanted her to be happy in another life, because she certainly wasn't happy here.\" </p> <p>Judge McGechan said that Casey was entitled to a life, and the court could not allow \"some sort of open season\" on the disabled. Albury Thomson was tried for murder, convicted of manslaughter, and sentenced to four years' jail. </p> <p>Following a public outcry, the New Zealand Court of Appeal reduced her sentence to 18 months. She was released in December 1998 after serving five months of her sentence, and returned home to her two remaining children, Hannah, four, and Shannon, three. </p> <p>Lester Mundell, chief advisor on disability to the New Zealand ministry of health, told me: \"The disability sector in New Zealand has generally been critical of the public sympathy shown to Janine Albury Thomson, pointing out the sanctity of human life and the need to not discount that because of disability. </p> <p>\"Understandably, there has also been comment from many parents of children with autism, that they have also come close to causing harm because of the lack of support.\" </p> <p>The case resulted in a New Zealand government inquiry into the provision of services for autism conducted by Professor John Werry. A number of initiatives resulted, including the piloting of the British EarlyBird intervention programme. EarlyBird was launched nationally in the UK in January and was devised by the NAS with funding from British Telecom. The aim is to help parents with pre-school autistic children. Parents attend weekly support groups over a period of three months with experts visiting them at home in between. </p> <p>The British Association for the Study and Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect (BASPCAN) is to hold Congress 2000 at York University on September 18. Professor Richard Sobsey, who is director of the JP Das Developmental Disabilities Centre at Alberta University in Canada, and head of the International Coalition on Abuse and Disability, will be giving a keynote speech entitled Abuse and Children with Disabilities. He is robustly opposed to so-called \"mercy killing\" against disabled people. </p> <p>\"Killing children who have disabilities is basically no different from killing other children,\" he says. \"Society has constructed a myth that says it's OK, or at least not really too bad, to kill these children.\" </p> <p>As the parent of a son with a severe disability, Sobsey knows what he's talking about. \"I know that sometimes it is demanding and sometimes it is heartbreaking, but also as the parent of a daughter without a disability I know that any parent can feel that way about any child at times.\" Alberta University is researching 1,130 homicides of disabled people over recent years. Sobsey said of the Albury Thomson case: \"The (initial) four-year sentence handed down by Justice McGechan is about average for killing a child with a disability and much shorter than the sentences typically given for killing a child without a disability. </p> <p>\"Two-thirds of all murdered children are killed by their own parents. Virtually all parents who kill their children are under great stress for one reason or another. If stress, lack of support, or concern over the child's future is an excuse for killing Casey, we'd better be prepared to excuse every other parent who kills his or her child. If not, we're just putting less value on the lives of children with disabilities.\" </p> <p>Sobsey emphasises that most parents of autistic children don't harm them. \"Some (parents) are great writers or artists or musicians. Most are just ordinary people, but in the middle of the night, trying to soothe a sleepless child, they are all pretty much the same. Deep inside they love their children... because of their special relationship with a child who needs a lot from them.\" </p> <p>Frank Johnson, my playwriting partner, has a mildly autistic son. Zachary is a gentle and affectionate boy who is able to respond to his parents, so their experience of autism has been positive. By contrast, a severely autistic child, like the 10-year-old Charley in our new play, can make life hell. The parents have a life-long responsibility for someone with profound difficulty in relating to the world.

      "body": "<p>Charity fundraisers who stop you in the street may have to watch their step in future. The practice of \"face-to-face\" fundraising, asking passers by to set up a direct debit, has spread rapidly through Britain's high streets in the past two years. But a review of charity law in Scotland, together with a code of practice south of the border, look likely to begin to curb what some see as an over-aggressive technique.</p> <p>The prospect of controls in Scotland has come with the launch of a consultation paper from the Scottish charity law review commission. The paper suggests that the legal definition of \"public charitable collection\" may be too narrow and notes that it excludes non-cash appeals.</p> <p> Jean McFadden, who is chairing the commission, says: \"I have heard that some people are worried about the increasing use of professional fundraisers who collect direct debit details from people in the street to ensure regular donations to charities.\" </p> <p>The 14-member commission is undertaking a programme of fact-finding visits over the summer and has invited comments on its paper by September 29. McFadden says she wants to \"hear directly from people what they really think about charities and what they think we should do to modernise the regulation of charities\". The commission's final recommendations will be presented to the Scottish parliament next spring. </p> <p>The Charity Commission says it has no plans for a corresponding review of the law in England and Wales. But a spokesperson warns: \"Members of the public should not give in to pressure to donate against their better judgment. If individuals are asked to make long-term financial commitments, they should feel free to take the material home and look at it more closely.\" </p> <p>To discourage aggressive forms of face-to-face fundraising, the Institute of Charity Fundraising Managers (ICFM) has just issued a code of practice on what it calls \"personal solicitation for committed gifts\". Andrew Watt, who heads the ICFM's policy unit, says: \"We as a sector see this work from the inside, from a practitioner's viewpoint. The danger is that the public can see the external manifestation of this as an alienating and inappropriate level of commercialism, rather than the professional approach that all responsible fundraisers must undertake.\" </p> <p>The institute has also drawn up a draft donors' rights charter and an accompanying complaints procedure. This eight-point pledge is being circulated among fundraisers for consultation and will be issued to the public in early December. It states that donors have the right to expect fundraisers to observe the highest professional standards at all times. </p> <p>Practitioners of face-to-face fundraising claim that they do maintain high standards. Personal Fundraising Partnership (PFP) is one of the leading agencies in the field and has an office in Glasgow. James Hale, its PR and marketing manager, says that its fundraisers only talk to passers-by who express an interest, and that there is no pressure to give to the charity. </p> <p>\"As with any new medium, we can understand people's concerns,\" says Hale. \"The same was true of direct mail or telesales in the past, but these rarely attract comments now. Face-to-face fundraising has inevitably attracted a lot of attention due to its visibility on the streets, though some reports have been alarmist and over-exaggerated.\" </p> <p>Greenpeace UK was one of the first organisations to introduce face-to-face fundraising, which it had pioneered in Germany. The charity's marketing director, Annie Moreton says she was surprised by McFadden's comments. \"Face-to-face has one of the lowest complaint rates compared with other forms of fundraising.\" </p> <p>Although it is seen as a new method, Moreton points out that talking to people to interest them in a charity is one of the oldest techniques in the world. Greenpeace has conducted research among those it has recruited and found an \"extremely positive\" response to the method. Moreton says that younger people, in particular, welcome the opportunity for dialogue. This seems to be borne out by research conducted by PFP. Of new donors recruited, 85% are under the age of 40 and some 60% to 75% are not supporting any other charity. Hale says: \"This shows that we are tapping into a new pool of donors that are not being reached by other fundraising methods.\" </p> <p>However, Richard Radcliffe, chair of legacy fundraising agency Smee and Ford, is concerned about the impact on existing donors. He says: \"I heard someone on the street the other day complaining about face-to-face fundraising going on and saying they would take the charity out of their will.\" As well as gathering anecdotal evidence, Radcliffe has conducted almost 400 focus groups researching attitudes to fundraising. He found the most common complaints of respondents centred on poor direct marketing, telemarketing - and face-to-face fundraising on the streets. \"What alarms me at the moment is how many members of the public think there is too much fundraising and that it is done in too direct a way,\" says Radcliffe. \"The danger is that this may lead to less giving in the long-term.\" </p> <p>\u0095 The Scottish charity law review commission's consultation paper is at <a href=\"http://www.charityreview.com\">www.charityreview.com</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Charity fundraisers who stop you in the street may have to watch their step in future. The practice of \"face-to-face\" fundraising, asking passers by to set up a direct debit, has spread rapidly through Britain's high streets in the past two years. But a review of charity law in Scotland, together with a code of practice south of the border, look likely to begin to curb what some see as an over-aggressive technique. The prospect of controls in Scotland has come with the launch of a consultation paper from the Scottish charity law review commission. The paper suggests that the legal definition of \"public charitable collection\" may be too narrow and notes that it excludes non-cash appeals. Jean McFadden, who is chairing the commission, says: \"I have heard that some people are worried about the increasing use of professional fundraisers who collect direct debit details from people in the street to ensure regular donations to charities.\" The 14-member commission is undertaking a programme of fact-finding visits over the summer and has invited comments on its paper by September 29. McFadden says she wants to \"hear directly from people what they really think about charities and what they think we should do to modernise the regulation of charities\". The commission's final recommendations will be presented to the Scottish parliament next spring. The Charity Commission says it has no plans for a corresponding review of the law in England and Wales. But a spokesperson warns: \"Members of the public should not give in to pressure to donate against their better judgment. If individuals are asked to make long-term financial commitments, they should feel free to take the material home and look at it more closely.\" To discourage aggressive forms of face-to-face fundraising, the Institute of Charity Fundraising Managers (ICFM) has just issued a code of practice on what it calls \"personal solicitation for committed gifts\". Andrew Watt, who heads the ICFM's policy unit, says: \"We as a sector see this work from the inside, from a practitioner's viewpoint. The danger is that the public can see the external manifestation of this as an alienating and inappropriate level of commercialism, rather than the professional approach that all responsible fundraisers must undertake.\" The institute has also drawn up a draft donors' rights charter and an accompanying complaints procedure. This eight-point pledge is being circulated among fundraisers for consultation and will be issued to the public in early December. It states that donors have the right to expect fundraisers to observe the highest professional standards at all times. Practitioners of face-to-face fundraising claim that they do maintain high standards. Personal Fundraising Partnership (PFP) is one of the leading agencies in the field and has an office in Glasgow. James Hale, its PR and marketing manager, says that its fundraisers only talk to passers-by who express an interest, and that there is no pressure to give to the charity. \"As with any new medium, we can understand people's concerns,\" says Hale. \"The same was true of direct mail or telesales in the past, but these rarely attract comments now. Face-to-face fundraising has inevitably attracted a lot of attention due to its visibility on the streets, though some reports have been alarmist and over-exaggerated.\" Greenpeace UK was one of the first organisations to introduce face-to-face fundraising, which it had pioneered in Germany. The charity's marketing director, Annie Moreton says she was surprised by McFadden's comments. \"Face-to-face has one of the lowest complaint rates compared with other forms of fundraising.\" Although it is seen as a new method, Moreton points out that talking to people to interest them in a charity is one of the oldest techniques in the world. Greenpeace has conducted research among those it has recruited and found an \"extremely positive\" response to the method. Moreton says that younger people, in particular, welcome the opportunity for dialogue. This seems to be borne out by research conducted by PFP. Of new donors recruited, 85% are under the age of 40 and some 60% to 75% are not supporting any other charity. Hale says: \"This shows that we are tapping into a new pool of donors that are not being reached by other fundraising methods.\" However, Richard Radcliffe, chair of legacy fundraising agency Smee and Ford, is concerned about the impact on existing donors. He says: \"I heard someone on the street the other day complaining about face-to-face fundraising going on and saying they would take the charity out of their will.\" As well as gathering anecdotal evidence, Radcliffe has conducted almost 400 focus groups researching attitudes to fundraising. He found the most common complaints of respondents centred on poor direct marketing, telemarketing - and face-to-face fundraising on the streets. \"What alarms me at the moment is how many members of the public think there is too much fundraising and that it is done in too direct a way,\" says Radcliffe. \"The danger is that this may lead to less giving in the long-term.\" \u0095 The Scottish charity law review commission's consultation paper is at www.charityreview.com",

The old farmhouse is in a huge estate of fields and woodlands surrounded by snowy peaks. </p> <p>Tucked into a mountain fold 1,000 metres high, the stone houses of Eourres, in the lower Alps, are strung out in a picturesque line with the church at the top end. The village had 800 people in 1789. Only 10 elderly peasants were left in 1990 when a group of eco-idealists decided to restore and re-occupy it. Soon 10 French adults with two children formed a community called Terres Nouvelles, led by Gilles Roy, a charismatic new-ager who had learned community skills at Findhorn in Scotland. They produced organic goats' cheese and honey. </p> <p>By 1990 most had left because they couldn't make a living and there were not enough schools for their kids. Gradually they were replaced by people who found Eourres a good proposition even though, or perhaps because, it was no longer a community. The newcomers and the few pioneers who stayed have turned Eourres into a viable oasis of organic vegetable and sheep farming with sustainable waste disposal in a reed bed, a publishing firm, high quality music-making, catering for tourists and rearing donkeys for mountain safaris. They number 60, including 15 children. </p> <p>Today Eourres is one of the most successful eco-villages in France - but ironically, the residents have decided to drop the title as they are busy and don't want to be bothered by itinerant eco-freaks and journalists. </p> <p>This movement has plenty of dreamers who don't make it. I climbed to a lofty hamlet in the Ard\u00e8che where a Parisian had bought 66 hectares of scrubland to found \"an eco-village for people who love beauty, deep ecology and the sacred at all levels.\" But Jean-Pierre Maitre has been waiting on his mountain for 10 years and has found no takers. Meanwhile, hostile neighbours set fire to his barn and bulldozed his fence. His own dog killed 15 of his sheep. Maitre is still there, still hoping. </p> <p>An eco-village of more promise is Bio Lopin, in the Jura. It is dedicated to eco-friendly building techniques with materials like straw bales, wool, hemp and logs bonded with sawdust and anchored in a mortar of lime and sand. Alain Richard inherited the 17-hectare farm, went on an eco-building course and used his new skills to build a farmhouse, stable, office, storehouse, pottery studio, and a lodging house for tourists. </p> <p>In the brave and precarious world of eco-villages, disaster always looms. At Valensolette, in the Provencal Alps, everything that can go wrong did. \"The members of this community had no method and no recruitment procedures but plenty of psychological problems,\" said Marcel Charran, the only one left on site. He had invited people to join him in turning the farm he inherited into an eco-village. Some, he conceded, \"were into serious organic agriculture, but the rest were into some kind of anarchist utopia.\" </p> <p>Charran has not given up. A wiser man, he plans to start again with a new team. Meanwhile he is converting a farm shed into tourist rooms. Once again, if you want to step aside from the consumer economy you still need to make money from it. Happily, it is possible to do both - and recruits for viable eco-villages never dry up.</p>",

Today Eourres is one of the most successful eco-villages in France - but ironically, the residents have decided to drop the title as they are busy and don't want to be bothered by itinerant eco-freaks and journalists. This movement has plenty of dreamers who don't make it. I climbed to a lofty hamlet in the Ard\u00e8che where a Parisian had bought 66 hectares of scrubland to found \"an eco-village for people who love beauty, deep ecology and the sacred at all levels.\" But Jean-Pierre Maitre has been waiting on his mountain for 10 years and has found no takers. Meanwhile, hostile neighbours set fire to his barn and bulldozed his fence. His own dog killed 15 of his sheep. Maitre is still there, still hoping. An eco-village of more promise is Bio Lopin, in the Jura. It is dedicated to eco-friendly building techniques with materials like straw bales, wool, hemp and logs bonded with sawdust and anchored in a mortar of lime and sand. Alain Richard inherited the 17-hectare farm, went on an eco-building course and used his new skills to build a farmhouse, stable, office, storehouse, pottery studio, and a lodging house for tourists. In the brave and precarious world of eco-villages, disaster always looms. At Valensolette, in the Provencal Alps, everything that can go wrong did. \"The members of this community had no method and no recruitment procedures but plenty of psychological problems,\" said Marcel Charran, the only one left on site. He had invited people to join him in turning the farm he inherited into an eco-village. Some, he conceded, \"were into serious organic agriculture, but the rest were into some kind of anarchist utopia.\" Charran has not given up. A wiser man, he plans to start again with a new team. Meanwhile he is converting a farm shed into tourist rooms. Once again, if you want to step aside from the consumer economy you still need to make money from it. Happily, it is possible to do both - and recruits for viable eco-villages never dry up.",

But then Collett is no academic or politician: he is a businessman who founded and runs a telephone messaging service. He has also started a company offering courses to raise the self-esteem of unemployed clients. \"It's my mission,\" says Collett, \"I don't make money on it\". </p> <p>Which is why eight people in their late teens and early 20s, none of whom has ever had a full-time job, are attending a two-day course in Peckham, south London. They are being put through the Goals motivation programme. Over the past five years, about 5,000 clients have tried Goals - a total which Collett, who first encountered the programme on a visit to the US a decade ago, finds frustrating. He is convinced that low self-esteem lies at the root of much alienation from the jobs market, and that the courses should be used more widely. </p> <p>Each student gets a workbook which sets out 10 keys to success. And on a video screen there are clips from a seminar where the president of the Foundation for Self-Esteem, Jack Canfield, expounds his can-do philosophy. The authorities in California are so impressed that all recipients of welfare payments must go on a Goals programme. </p> <p>\"You are going to learn practical ways to improve your life that self-made millionaires, Olympic athletes, famous movie stars and people like you have used to create successes in their lives,\" promises Canfield's introduction in the workbook. In the context of Peckham \"people like you\", explains the course facilitator, John McNamara, can mean those who experience poor education, poverty, drugs and crime. Participants on courses in other cities include former industrial workers in Glasgow and ex-prisoners. </p> <p>The cost per person is just \u00a325, but the courses are not a quick fix; there are lasting improvements for many takers, insists Collett. His argument is that training, re-skilling and coaching in interview techniques are of no use unless the jobless can be convinced to adhere to a progression of targets. This begins with simple rules such as: \"Use only positive self-talk, I can... I will\"; advances through medium-term goals, for example: \"I will get a day care centre job within six months\"; and culminates in a career target like: \"I will be director of a day care centre in 18 months' time.\" </p> <p>The emphasis Goals places on taking any job, however menial or low paid, as the first step does not find favour with some experts on employment; and the undeniably American spiel of Canfield and the videoed testimony of others, which has a touch of the religious revivalist meeting, might be a turn-off for some. </p> <p>Day two in Peckham. A young man who did not turn up the first day has now joined the group; another day-one client misses the morning session, pops in at lunch, promising to be there in the afternoon, then fails to show. If McNamara is exasperated, he doesn't let on. It is a big effort for many clients to turn up at 10am, he says, as their days usually begin much later. </p> <p>Mid-afternoon. One participant, lets call him Ben, has had enough of the 10 stages in his workbook. No need to write down what he is aiming for, as McNamara suggests, because Ben reckons he can keep it all in his head. McNamara says that setting down goals makes the exercise more real. </p> <p>Not to me, insists Ben, who adds that he is self-employed \"so I know what I want to do\". By now, he is putting on his puffa jacket, exclaiming that \"this is school stuff\", and heading for the door. </p> <p>McNamara deals with his exit calmly; attendance is voluntary, after all; and the others - a bit of ribbing and a few street-smart asides thrown in - seem impressed at what they have achieved in two days. They have been told that it is no good blaming others for their problems; change lies within their own grasp. They have co-operated in an exercise in \"guided visualisation\" led by McNamara. With eyes closed, deep breaths and rather spooky music in the background, they have conjured up their ideal home, relationship, career - and set dates for getting them. </p> <p>The important message is learning the technique for boosting self-confidence; then using it at home, week after week, until the situation improves. That is the hardest part. But the message is optimistic. McNamara gives out his phone numbers, enjoining the group to ring him anytime for encouragement. And Collett, self-made businessman with an altruistic streak, dreams of starting an institute of self-esteem; of getting ministers to agree to a monitoring programme to show whether Goals works and hopes of taking his message to Tony Blair. </p> <p>In the US, more than 600,000 participants have taken part in Goals, and many swear by it. In Peckham, one young woman says it was really helpful, though it seemed to have been less useful in employment terms than in aiding her to sort herself out after the end of a relationship. Her friend is enthusiastic, too. By autumn next year, she wants to be on a media studies course. Igniting that flickering hope, at \u00a325 a time, may be worth it after all. </p> <p><strong>Does the New Deal work? </strong></p> <p>Unemployment may be at a 25-year low, but it is twice as high among young adults as among the workforce as a whole. In the 18-24 age group, 11% are jobless and seeking work and almost four in 10 of them have been in that position more than six months. Of the 412,000 unemployed in that age group in the UK, 157,000 have been jobless more than six months, 68,000 more than a year and 28,000 more than two years. The latter is the highest since 1998. </p> <p>Argument over the success, or otherwise, of the government's new deal programme rages on. Labour promised to find work for 250,000 young people unemployed for more than six months, and by the end of April had done so for 216,000. But more than a quarter have returned to the dole within 13 weeks.</p> <p>How much of this is attributable to the New Deal is debatable. In the year before the programme became fully effective, in spring 1998, the number of people aged 18-24 who had been jobless more than six months fell 60,000 due to strong economic growth. Some estimates suggest that two in three who leave the New Deal for jobs would have found work irrespective. </p> <p>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.motivationalsystems.co.uk\">Motivational systems</a></p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong> Interactive froth </strong></p> <p> Jonathan Kaye's vision as expressed in Why interactive will mean active, (August 16) did not do justice to two related seminal issues in disabled people's lives - disposable income and power. At long last, disabled people's power is being recognised as real. Our collective voice is beginning to bite. Paradoxically, interactive TV and new technology generally, while holding tremendous potential to liberate and empower us, holds equal power to take our collective eye off the ball. Groceries delivered to my door are only part of the struggle. While succumbing to a growth in home-based services, I fear we could be seduced into a false sense of security and become less radical in our demands - for a share of the power held by non-disabled people. </p> <p>The other issue is the financial cost of new technology. Most disabled people don't have much money - a significant part of what we do have is taken away (including benefit payments) by local authority social services departments for basic, essential support services. Within the last month the government has committed itself to continue charging disabled people for services that most people can do for themselves, like getting out of bed and getting back into it. Interactive TV, like most fashionable panaceas, is froth. Until the state addresses the continuing basic denial of human rights to disabled people we will forever be outsiders looking in. <strong><br>John Knight</strong><br> Essex</p> <p><strong> Key skills</strong> </p> <p> How refreshing it was to see an article (Price is right, August 16), not only discussing NHS procurement, but also acknowledging the holistic skills and considerations that such procurement requires. </p> <p>Internal purchasers need rewards that reflect their skills. A good procurement officer will save far more than his salary, as your cited examples reflect, and to attract such staff calls for good pay and conditions. Conversely, poor purchasers, or their managers, should not be allowed to go on without review. </p> <p>Politicians and NHS management must make it worthwhile for healthcare providers to wish to make savings. As long as we have a public sector ideology within which it seems acceptable to operate at a loss (through fear of subsequent cuts should budgets be under-spent), there is little motivation for providers to review the situation into which procurement has unfortunately been driven. </p> <p>With annual budgets being the major driver for NHS provider spend, it will remain hard for organisations to make relatively heavy up-front investment for long-term efficiency and financial benefit. It seems unforgivable not to redress this reality. <strong><br>Dr Gill Wade</strong><br> Celtic Dimensions<br> Gwynedd</p> <p> <strong> Nothing to be proud of</strong> </p> <p> The article Walk in the Past by Janet Snell (August 9), leaves many key questions unanswered. </p> <p>Why are NCH Action for Children and Joan Kerry pleased about their achievements? Their response to the plight of Britain's former child migrants, who were in their care, is both too little and far too late. </p> <p>The agencies involved in the child migration schemes removed thousands of young children from their country of birth, their families and their friends. Former child migrants have been deprived of their identities and denied their families for decades. Many parents have died not knowing where their children are. </p> <p>These agencies were first alerted to these issues and the consequences of their cruel and inhumane practices over 10 years ago, but they chose to do precious little until recently. Why did it take a House of Commons select health committee inquiry to jolt these agencies out of their complacency? </p> <p>How many former child migrants or their parents have died over the past decade? How many might have been reunited with their parents if NCH had been more rapid and generous in its response? Instead, they are left to visit a graveside. </p> <p>Why did NCH not contract out this service to an independent agency? Fewer than half the survivors wished to use the NCH service. Who was consulted about this half-hearted project? Certainly not this association. <strong><br>Harold Haig</strong><br> International Association of Former Child Migrants and their Families<br> Australia</p> <p> <strong> Legal strain</strong> </p> <p> I was surprised to see that the only response to Jenny Sinclair's article on fostering (Letters, August 2) made no attempt to reply to her apparently justified complaints about her situation. Although she did mention the lack of support offered by the agency which employed her to care for very difficult youngsters, her main problems seemed to be with the intolerable constraints placed upon her family life by the needs of the laws which insist upon detailed checks on anyone who might come into contact with the foster children. If this situation is common, it must cause anyone who might contemplate fostering to think again. <strong><br>Hilary Brindley</strong><br> London SE24</p> <p> <strong> Lack of care</strong> </p> <p> I am 80 years old and live alone. I was briefly in hospital for an operation on my hand and was visited by social services who asked if there was any help I would need when I went home. Yes, I replied, someone to bathe me and clean the house. These things are not possible, she said. They are not insured for bathing clients and cleaning was limited to \"dusting the tops\", no furniture could be moved. How awful it must be to be disabled and dependent on social services - never to have a bath, and never to have the dust cleared out from behind your chair or under your bed. </p> <p>Do people realise what care in the community amounts to?<strong><br>Barbara Hutton</strong><br> address withheld</p> <p>\u0095 Write to Guardian Society, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER; or fax 020-7713 4154 or email society@theguardian.com Please supply your full address.

      "bodyText": "Interactive froth Jonathan Kaye's vision as expressed in Why interactive will mean active, (August 16) did not do justice to two related seminal issues in disabled people's lives - disposable income and power. At long last, disabled people's power is being recognised as real. Our collective voice is beginning to bite. Paradoxically, interactive TV and new technology generally, while holding tremendous potential to liberate and empower us, holds equal power to take our collective eye off the ball. Groceries delivered to my door are only part of the struggle. While succumbing to a growth in home-based services, I fear we could be seduced into a false sense of security and become less radical in our demands - for a share of the power held by non-disabled people. The other issue is the financial cost of new technology. Most disabled people don't have much money - a significant part of what we do have is taken away (including benefit payments) by local authority social services departments for basic, essential support services. Within the last month the government has committed itself to continue charging disabled people for services that most people can do for themselves, like getting out of bed and getting back into it. Interactive TV, like most fashionable panaceas, is froth. Until the state addresses the continuing basic denial of human rights to disabled people we will forever be outsiders looking in. John Knight Essex Key skills How refreshing it was to see an article (Price is right, August 16), not only discussing NHS procurement, but also acknowledging the holistic skills and considerations that such procurement requires. Internal purchasers need rewards that reflect their skills. A good procurement officer will save far more than his salary, as your cited examples reflect, and to attract such staff calls for good pay and conditions. Conversely, poor purchasers, or their managers, should not be allowed to go on without review. Politicians and NHS management must make it worthwhile for healthcare providers to wish to make savings. As long as we have a public sector ideology within which it seems acceptable to operate at a loss (through fear of subsequent cuts should budgets be under-spent), there is little motivation for providers to review the situation into which procurement has unfortunately been driven. With annual budgets being the major driver for NHS provider spend, it will remain hard for organisations to make relatively heavy up-front investment for long-term efficiency and financial benefit. It seems unforgivable not to redress this reality. Dr Gill Wade Celtic Dimensions Gwynedd Nothing to be proud of The article Walk in the Past by Janet Snell (August 9), leaves many key questions unanswered. Why are NCH Action for Children and Joan Kerry pleased about their achievements? Their response to the plight of Britain's former child migrants, who were in their care, is both too little and far too late. The agencies involved in the child migration schemes removed thousands of young children from their country of birth, their families and their friends. Former child migrants have been deprived of their identities and denied their families for decades. Many parents have died not knowing where their children are. These agencies were first alerted to these issues and the consequences of their cruel and inhumane practices over 10 years ago, but they chose to do precious little until recently. Why did it take a House of Commons select health committee inquiry to jolt these agencies out of their complacency? How many former child migrants or their parents have died over the past decade? How many might have been reunited with their parents if NCH had been more rapid and generous in its response? Instead, they are left to visit a graveside. Why did NCH not contract out this service to an independent agency? Fewer than half the survivors wished to use the NCH service. Who was consulted about this half-hearted project? Certainly not this association. Harold Haig International Association of Former Child Migrants and their Families Australia Legal strain I was surprised to see that the only response to Jenny Sinclair's article on fostering (Letters, August 2) made no attempt to reply to her apparently justified complaints about her situation. Although she did mention the lack of support offered by the agency which employed her to care for very difficult youngsters, her main problems seemed to be with the intolerable constraints placed upon her family life by the needs of the laws which insist upon detailed checks on anyone who might come into contact with the foster children. If this situation is common, it must cause anyone who might contemplate fostering to think again. Hilary Brindley London SE24 Lack of care I am 80 years old and live alone. I was briefly in hospital for an operation on my hand and was visited by social services who asked if there was any help I would need when I went home. Yes, I replied, someone to bathe me and clean the house. These things are not possible, she said. They are not insured for bathing clients and cleaning was limited to \"dusting the tops\", no furniture could be moved. How awful it must be to be disabled and dependent on social services - never to have a bath, and never to have the dust cleared out from behind your chair or under your bed. Do people realise what care in the community amounts to?

      "body": "<p>Sixty years ago on September 7, 1940, German bombs killed 430 civilians and seriously injured 1,600 more in London's East End. The blitz had started. </p> <p>The year before, when war had been declared, over 1m children - my sister and I among them - had been evacuated from the cities. By January, 1940, most of us had returned home as the bombs never came. Then Hitler changed tactics. For 76 consecutive nights, save for two evenings of bad weather, the planes rained destruction upon London. </p> <p>Our family lived in Ilford, to the east of the city, which was a target as it contained a large munitions factory. Nights were spent in stuffy, overcrowded shelters. Daytime entailed queuing with mum for scarce food. Bread and potatoes were available, although sometimes they could not be cooked because bombs had shattered gas and electricity mains. Baths could only be taken in a regulation five inches of water and even today I feel guilty if I use more. </p> <p>It was irksome, but more than that, we were scared. One morning, we emerged from the shelter to look at London burning with 1,500 fires. We saw maimed people being dragged out of ruined buildings and huge craters in which nobody could have survived. We were scared of death. And we were scared of invasion, for the German forces were poised to cross the channel. Trauma, death, fear was the blitz childhood. There was one compensation: most schools were closed. But youngsters roamed the streets and public air-raid shelters had to be protected against vandals. The number of under-17s convicted of breaking the law doubled. </p> <p>The blitz sparked further evacuations from bombed cities. We stayed, however, because my parents could not bear to be parted from us again. One night, we were too slow to reach the shelter. We stood hand-in-hand on the landing of our house with dad saying: \"If we go, we go together.\" Shrapnel smashed the windows, but we survived. </p> <p>By May 1941, the blitz was almost over. Ironically, we were then evacuated after one of the last raids rendered our home uninhabitable. This time, mum went with us to the country. Within two years, the threat of bombs apparently over, we were glad to come back to a repaired home, a re-opened school and, soon after, a new baby brother. </p> <p>But the optimism was false. Germany launched its V1s and V2s: the former bomb-laden pilotless planes, the latter flying rockets against which there was no defence. On November 24, 1944, my school was shaken by an enormous explosion. I ran back through a death-strewn street. A nearby rocket had crushed our house. As I stood in the rubble in tears, a hand came on my shoulder and a voice said: \"It's all right, son.\" Dad, mum and the baby had been dug out seriously injured. </p> <p>Eventually, they recovered and we were evacuated again. Mum and we three kids lived in one room. I was unhappy at an overcrowded school where the teachers resented the \"vaccees\". But within six months, the war was over and we were home for good. </p> <p>Children are, of course, allowed to be scared. Government propaganda constructed the myth that blitzed adults were all brave, cheerful and devoted to the royal family and Winston Churchill. Far from it. </p> <p>Some adults fled from London. Looting occurred. The king and queen were booed by some East Enders who contrasted the royals' luxury with their lack of food. Grievances could erupt and the radical priest, John Groser, smashed open a food depot in Stepney, in the East End, when officials were slow to feed his bombed-out neighbours. </p> <p>Nonetheless, the bombs did stimulate acts of courage. My dad worked in the munitions factory. In the evenings he joined other air raid wardens in smothering incendiary bombs with blankets and digging out the wounded. He would come home ashen from his harrowing experiences. He was both brave and scared, a mixture found in thousands of men and women who served in the home guard, as emergency ambulance drivers, firefighters and auxiliary nurses. </p> <p>The involvement of masses of ordinary people in vital posts lifted morale. The number of suicides and mental health problems dropped. The participation was significant for two other reasons. First, it taught many working-class citizens that they could organise and lead. Blitzed areas survived less because of central government action, more because of neighbourhood action. Second, it radicalised a section of society. In the endless hours of waiting, politics was discussed - one reason why Labour won a landslide victory in 1945. </p> <p>The evacuations undoubtedly saved lives. Yet welfare worker Lucy Faithfull was involved in a study which showed that, with the exception of education, children who stayed with their families through the blitz fared better physically and emotionally. Shortly before her death in 1996, the then Baroness Faithfull told me that, as a children's officer, she advocated keeping families together \"because I realised that wherever possible children should remain with their parents\". Today, with more youngsters entering care and custody, it is a lesson which needs learning again. </p> <p>I hardly went to school and failed the new 11-plus exam. Later, I did make it to university, thanks to war-time reforms which opened up higher education to the working-class young people. Unfortunately, the same government failed to build upon the local action which flourished during the blitz. Instead, it concentrated on centralised corporations run by appointees. Sixty years later, Britain has 3,000 socially blitzed neighbourhoods. If the government's social exclusion unit wants to regenerate them, it should learn from the blitz - that the solutions are to be found among local residents, not by outside agencies.</p> <p><strong>Life for the evacuees </strong></p> <p>The bombs led to three waves of evacuation in 1939, 1940 and 1943-44. Children and young mothers went from danger areas to reception areas where foster parents were compelled to take them. </p> <p>The foster parents were either middle class or stable, rural inhabitants. The evacuees were mainly from working-class districts. Middle England met urban poverty.</p> <p>The Women's Group on Public Welfare made a famous study which stated: \"The dreadful lesson of evacuation was the light it threw upon the home conditions of the lowest of town dwellers.\" Middle-class voices then added to the pressure for a welfare state.</p> <p>The evacuation also focused attention on the needs of separated children. Local authorities had to expand their numbers of child care staff to help unhappy and disturbed evacuees. The inadequacies of services were revealed and Lady Marjory Allen led a wartime cam-paign which culminated in the 1948 Children Act, requiring authorities to establish children's departments.</p> <p>Some evacuees enjoyed their time in the country. Others were badly treated, and only in recent years has it emerged that some were physically and sexually abused. But, at least, the evacuations did lead to the first local authority service with the sole task of caring for children \"deprived of a normal home life\".</p> <p><strong>Britain in wartime </strong></p> <p>\u0095 From London, the blitz spread to most large British cities. In one night's bombing, 554 people were killed in Coventry and the word \"coventrated\" came to mean a town razed to the ground. In two nights in February, 1941, Clydebank had 35,000 of its 45,000 population made homeless. </p> <p>\u0095 The government was reluctant to admit the existence of Germany's special air weapons. Not until 1944 did it concede the existence of parachute bombs. Yet in 1941 a landmine attached to a parachute drifted on to a pub in Clayhall, Ilford, killing more than 60 people. Initially, official propaganda attributed the V1s to gas explosions.</p> <p>\u0095 In all, 70,000 tons of bombs fell on Britain, killing over 60,000 civilians and destroying or damaging over 3.7m homes.</p> <p>\u0095 During 1944, 980,000 citizens worked part-time as air raid wardens. Not enough MPs volunteered and the House of Commons burned down.</p> <p>\u0095 Infant mortality fell from 53 to 49 deaths per 1,000 live births. Despite food shortages, the health of many children improved because of welfare foods and better medical services.</p> <p>\u0095 Births outside marriage rose from 4.4% in 1939 to 9.1 % in 1945. The divorce rate almost tripled.</p> <p>\u0095 Male unemployment figures dropped from over 1m to 40,000 in 1944.

Facing south to secure the right feng shui, it stands on a marble plinth 20 metres (65ft) high inscribed with pious invocations to those it commemorates.</p> <p>It is one of the finest monuments in Zijin, a poor rural county in the province of Guangdong which has missed out on China's economic boom. Or rather, it was. Last week Mr Huang panicked as Beijing's anti-corruption campaign gathered pace, finally yielding to complaints that he had built the mausoleum with public funds.</p> <p>\"Several party officials told me the best idea is to knock it down,\" he admitted. \"Destroying it may be bad luck, but it's become a millstone around my neck.\"</p> <p>Mr Huang says the money for the monument came from a relative in Hong Kong. But when the Nanfang Weekend newspaper in Guangzhou began to investigate, he hired a gang of tough peasants and went out by night to smash it to pieces.</p> <p>The deputy party chairman of Zijin county is a very small fry swept up in the net of the new campaign.

      "bodyText": "Huang Zuolin, a communist party local official, is the most filial of sons, and has built a splendid tomb for his ancestors on a hill in south China. Facing south to secure the right feng shui, it stands on a marble plinth 20 metres (65ft) high inscribed with pious invocations to those it commemorates. It is one of the finest monuments in Zijin, a poor rural county in the province of Guangdong which has missed out on China's economic boom. Or rather, it was. Last week Mr Huang panicked as Beijing's anti-corruption campaign gathered pace, finally yielding to complaints that he had built the mausoleum with public funds. \"Several party officials told me the best idea is to knock it down,\" he admitted. \"Destroying it may be bad luck, but it's become a millstone around my neck.\" Mr Huang says the money for the monument came from a relative in Hong Kong. But when the Nanfang Weekend newspaper in Guangzhou began to investigate, he hired a gang of tough peasants and went out by night to smash it to pieces. The deputy party chairman of Zijin county is a very small fry swept up in the net of the new campaign. His sins do not begin to compare with those of Cheng Kejie, the party boss in neighbouring Guangxi province, whose death sentence for corruption was confirmed yesterday. Cheng, a former deputy chairman of the Chinese parliament, was found guilty last month of accepting nearly \u00a33.3m in collusion with his mistress Li Ping. A party spokesman blamed his downfall on \"the temptations of women and money\". An anti-corruption exhibition has opened in Beijing with Cheng's case as its centrepiece. Photographs have been published of the gold, diamond rings and expensive watches which the couple acquired. They are said to have been caught on closed-circuit videos blithely gambling away their loot in casinos in Macau. The death sentence has to be ratified by the supreme people's court, but \"legal experts\" in the Chinese media have already declared that he has no chance of escaping execution. Li, who collaborated with the authorities after being brought back from her hideaway in Hong Kong, has been given a life sentence. Known as the \"Madame Mao\" of Guangxi province, she may have friends who can ease her plight. Although Mr Huang's alleged malpractices are on a minute scale compared to these big fish, his sort of local corruption is a more serious threat to the regime. Conspicuous spending in poor communities cannot escape notice: over-taxed peasants see \"their money\" being frittered on lavish buildings, expensive cars, banquets and prostitutes. Mr Huang built his family mausoleum in 1994, at the high tide of the \"get rich first\" enthusiasm promoted by the late leader Deng Xiaoping. He says it \"only\" cost 170,000 renminbi (\u00a313,000): the average annual income today in Zijin is 2,800 renminbi (\u00a3215). Mr Huang set up a \"development zone\" in Zijin, annexing good farmland from the peasants for low compensation.

Mr Huang says that he has been chastened by the anti-corruption film Choice between Life and Death, which is compulsory viewing for Communist party officials all over China.

      "body": "<p>Keeping politics out of sport is a worthy concept, but often futile. Mixing the two can be important - take the boycott of South Africa's apartheid regime. At other times, politics enrich sport: the Olympics, for example, are much duller now that the Iron Curtain has fallen. Sport can even aid the political process by bringing countries closer together. Past cricket and hockey tours between India and Pakistan have built bridges, albeit temporary ones, when the two governments have been deadlocked. But India's decision to withdraw from this year's Sahara Cup tournament in Toronto is a case of politicians interfering in sport to no-one's benefit.</p> <p>A good argument could be put forward for cancelling the tournament on the basis that public confidence and interest in these \"offshore\" circuses has been lost, and that India and Pakistan, more than others, have done cricket a disservice by accepting meaningless invitation after meaningless invitation. Indeed India would be excused for withdrawing because the team and fans are totally demoralised after a year of failure on the pitch and disgrace off it.</p> <p>Citing the Kashmir conflict as the reason for withdrawal, as India did last year, simply panders to the rabble-rousers on both sides of the divide. Kashmir isn't a clear-cut issue like apartheid and it has been waxing and waning ever since partition in 1947. If you used the current Indian government's rationale, India and Pakistan would never have played each other. Does that mean that India will pull out if they face Pakistan in the ICC Knock-Out Trophy in Kenya? I doubt it.</p> <p>The decision is actually another manifestation of the rift between the Indian government and the Indian cricket board - a confrontation that is threatening to destroy any hopes of rehabilitation once the match-fixing dust settles. The Indian sports ministry wants India's sullied stars out of the team until they are cleared but the cricket board is backing the players and their inclusion. </p> <p>Sports minister SS Dhindsa has been regularly critical of the board's administration and its soft line on the suspected players. A few weeks ago, the Indian board had assured its Pakistani counterparts that India would be competing in Toronto and touring Pakistan later in the year for a three-match Test series. Now the Test series is in doubt too.</p> <p>Indian cricket needs unity of purpose from its rulers but the two bodies have shown that they are unable to work together effectively. SS Dhindsa should either let the board get on with its job or, if he believes that it is incompetent, he should appoint officials he can work with and who he thinks are more effective.</p> <p>While this year's Sahara Cup might have been a folly for obvious reasons, India should have kept politics out of its decision. India's tour to Pakistan will be the first since 1989-90 when all four Tests were drawn. Dhindsa and Co. mustn't be allowed to interfere again. This is a tour that the fans want to see, and cricket can help dismantle political barriers. After all, it is only 18 months ago that a victorious Pakistan side was applauded around the Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai by heartbroken but sporting Indian fans.</p> <p><em>Kamran Abbasi, born in Lahore, brought up in Rotherham, is editor of the Bulletin of the World Health Organisation.

      "bodyText": "Keeping politics out of sport is a worthy concept, but often futile. Mixing the two can be important - take the boycott of South Africa's apartheid regime. At other times, politics enrich sport: the Olympics, for example, are much duller now that the Iron Curtain has fallen. Sport can even aid the political process by bringing countries closer together. Past cricket and hockey tours between India and Pakistan have built bridges, albeit temporary ones, when the two governments have been deadlocked. But India's decision to withdraw from this year's Sahara Cup tournament in Toronto is a case of politicians interfering in sport to no-one's benefit. A good argument could be put forward for cancelling the tournament on the basis that public confidence and interest in these \"offshore\" circuses has been lost, and that India and Pakistan, more than others, have done cricket a disservice by accepting meaningless invitation after meaningless invitation. Indeed India would be excused for withdrawing because the team and fans are totally demoralised after a year of failure on the pitch and disgrace off it. Citing the Kashmir conflict as the reason for withdrawal, as India did last year, simply panders to the rabble-rousers on both sides of the divide. Kashmir isn't a clear-cut issue like apartheid and it has been waxing and waning ever since partition in 1947. If you used the current Indian government's rationale, India and Pakistan would never have played each other. Does that mean that India will pull out if they face Pakistan in the ICC Knock-Out Trophy in Kenya? I doubt it. The decision is actually another manifestation of the rift between the Indian government and the Indian cricket board - a confrontation that is threatening to destroy any hopes of rehabilitation once the match-fixing dust settles. The Indian sports ministry wants India's sullied stars out of the team until they are cleared but the cricket board is backing the players and their inclusion. Sports minister SS Dhindsa has been regularly critical of the board's administration and its soft line on the suspected players. A few weeks ago, the Indian board had assured its Pakistani counterparts that India would be competing in Toronto and touring Pakistan later in the year for a three-match Test series. Now the Test series is in doubt too. Indian cricket needs unity of purpose from its rulers but the two bodies have shown that they are unable to work together effectively. SS Dhindsa should either let the board get on with its job or, if he believes that it is incompetent, he should appoint officials he can work with and who he thinks are more effective. While this year's Sahara Cup might have been a folly for obvious reasons, India should have kept politics out of its decision. India's tour to Pakistan will be the first since 1989-90 when all four Tests were drawn. Dhindsa and Co. mustn't be allowed to interfere again. This is a tour that the fans want to see, and cricket can help dismantle political barriers. After all, it is only 18 months ago that a victorious Pakistan side was applauded around the Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai by heartbroken but sporting Indian fans.

      "bodyText": "More videos showing hardcore sex have been approved by film censors in the last month than in all of last year, it was revealed yesterday. The British Board of Film Censors last month brought in new guidelines which allowed more explicit scenes of real sex to be shown on films sold through licensed sex shops to adults. One leading porn film distributor yesterday predicted a rise of up to 50% over the next year in the number of videos sold because the rule relaxation will allow stronger material to be shown. The rise in the number of titles classed as R18 has been mainly caused by a backlog which built up while the new rules were being drafted, said the board. In addition, video distributors have starting resubmitting films so as to have scenes reinstated which were cut under the old rules. Guidelines were changed following a high court ruling against the board for refusing certificates to seven sex films. Rather than continue the appeals process, the body opted to alter its rules. Previously banned material which can now be shown includes close-up shots of penetration by penis, finger, tongue or sex toy, ejaculation, oral-genital contact, and masturbation. Since the changes on July 18 which moved Britain's censorship laws closer to the rest of Europe, the board has given a further 23 R18 ratings, which is two more than were given in the whole of the previous year. The average number of R18s handed out over the past nine years is around 22, which rep resents less than 1% of the 5,000 video titles handled annually by the board. An R18 classification is given to a film during which real sex is shown, while simulated sex acts will usually get an 18 rating. Distributors of hardcore porn films are preparing for increased profits as a result of the relaxed rules. Gary Campbell, a director of Prime Time, the second largest UK distributor, said the more liberal censorship laws could curtail the black market for sex videos, which was seven times larger than the legal market. \"The punters for years wanted stronger material. Now the material is in line with Europe, demand is going up, which is good as it takes it away from the black market.\" Sue Clark, spokeswoman for the board, said no videos had been denied an R18 rating since the new guidelines started: \"The industry knows what the guidelines are.

      "body": "<p>SMG, the former Scottish Media Group, yesterday emerged as a potential bidder for the HTV television franchise shaken loose by the most recent round of ITV consolidation. </p> <p>Andrew Flanagan, SMG chief executive, said the company would naturally be interested in HTV, the Wales and western England franchise. Granada needs to sell the business to meet the demands of regulators after acquiring the ITV interests of United News &amp; Media earlier this year. </p> <p>\"ITV is a core business of ours so of course we will be interested in looking at acquiring another part of it,\" Mr Flanagan said. \"The question is price. We don't have unlimited capital and we have to make choices. We would have to compare HTV to our national businesses which give us a broader profile and to those in faster growing markets.\" </p> <p>Many had assumed that Carlton Communications, Granada's chief rival, would be the only realistic bidder for HTV, which is expected to be sold for between \u00a3400m and \u00a3500m. </p> <p>SMG's determination to expand outside Scotland was also underlined as it raised \u00a345m through a share placing to pursue further acquisitions. </p> <p>The group, which earlier this year heightened its profile with the takeover of Chris Evans' Ginger Media Group, placed 14.6m new shares which were oversubscribed more than three times. Shares in the group closed 8% higher at 324.5p yesterday. </p> <p>SMG has been transformed over the past five years from Scottish Television, which owned a single ITV franchise, to a group with interests in cinema advertising, newspapers, posters and radio. The company rebranded earlier this year to reflect the growing amount of business outside of Scotland. \"There are probably more strategic options out there now than there have ever been before,\" Mr Flanagan said. \"The share placing will provide us with the financial flexibility to capitalise on opportunities as they arise.\" </p> <p>The placing was made as SMG turned in a 37% increase in revenues to \u00a3153m for the first half of the year. Pre-tax profits were up 25% at \u00a330m. </p> <p>Mr Flanagan said the results silenced critics, including the group's largest shareholder, Granada, who had accused SMG last year of overpaying for Ginger. The Ginger deal gave SMG Virgin Radio and made it the sixth largest TV production business in Britain - uniting the likes of the now axed TFI Friday with the company behind detective series Taggart. </p> <p>\"People were criticising that deal without really any knowledge of the company. They were assuming that we were paying \u00a3225m for Chris Evans the DJ and TV presenter but that wasn't the case. </p> <p>\"We were paying for the fundamental value of the business. It turns out that Ginger is a far better business than even we had realised.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "SMG, the former Scottish Media Group, yesterday emerged as a potential bidder for the HTV television franchise shaken loose by the most recent round of ITV consolidation. Andrew Flanagan, SMG chief executive, said the company would naturally be interested in HTV, the Wales and western England franchise. Granada needs to sell the business to meet the demands of regulators after acquiring the ITV interests of United News &amp; Media earlier this year. \"ITV is a core business of ours so of course we will be interested in looking at acquiring another part of it,\" Mr Flanagan said. \"The question is price. We don't have unlimited capital and we have to make choices. We would have to compare HTV to our national businesses which give us a broader profile and to those in faster growing markets.\" Many had assumed that Carlton Communications, Granada's chief rival, would be the only realistic bidder for HTV, which is expected to be sold for between \u00a3400m and \u00a3500m. SMG's determination to expand outside Scotland was also underlined as it raised \u00a345m through a share placing to pursue further acquisitions. The group, which earlier this year heightened its profile with the takeover of Chris Evans' Ginger Media Group, placed 14.6m new shares which were oversubscribed more than three times. Shares in the group closed 8% higher at 324.5p yesterday. SMG has been transformed over the past five years from Scottish Television, which owned a single ITV franchise, to a group with interests in cinema advertising, newspapers, posters and radio. The company rebranded earlier this year to reflect the growing amount of business outside of Scotland. \"There are probably more strategic options out there now than there have ever been before,\" Mr Flanagan said. \"The share placing will provide us with the financial flexibility to capitalise on opportunities as they arise.\" The placing was made as SMG turned in a 37% increase in revenues to \u00a3153m for the first half of the year. Pre-tax profits were up 25% at \u00a330m. Mr Flanagan said the results silenced critics, including the group's largest shareholder, Granada, who had accused SMG last year of overpaying for Ginger. The Ginger deal gave SMG Virgin Radio and made it the sixth largest TV production business in Britain - uniting the likes of the now axed TFI Friday with the company behind detective series Taggart. \"People were criticising that deal without really any knowledge of the company. They were assuming that we were paying \u00a3225m for Chris Evans the DJ and TV presenter but that wasn't the case. \"We were paying for the fundamental value of the business. It turns out that Ginger is a far better business than even we had realised.\"",

In a sharply worded warning to managers overseeing the break-up of the tube for the partial selloff - which has been passed to the Guardian - Keith Beattie says there does not seem to be any contractual requirement for the private sector companies to ensure safety compliance. The latest disclosure follows last week's leak of a letter written this month by the government's chief rail inspector, Stanley Hart, which complained of growing concern over safety and \"potentially serious consequences\" of John Prescott's plans to hand over the tube's infrastructure and maintenance to the private sector. Officials insisted at the time that the safety problems on the underground were not related to preparations for the public-private partnership, but Mr Beattie's warning - written in March - specifically links the risks to the \"shadow running\" of the part-privatised structure. Earlier yesterday, LU's managing director Derek Smith launched a thinly-veiled attack on London mayor Ken Livingstone for \"alarmist scaremongering\" about the safety risks of the partial selloff - which the government appears determined to force through before it hands control of the underground network to the mayor - and for seeking to \"turn the operational foundation of our business into a political football\". A spokesman for LU said safety and operational matters would \"always take priority over a media sideshow of out-dated political arguments\" and that the issues raised in Mr Beattie's letter were being addressed as part of the \"shadow running\" process. But Mr Livingstone said last night of the newly-leaked document: \"I am appalled that none of these problems have been brought either to the attention of myself as mayor or the travelling public. Those responsible must now respond to these concerns. \"The health and safety executive has made clear the real issue is that they have lost confidence in London Underground since preparations began for part-privatisation of the tube.\" Meanwhile, pressure on the government and London Underground management over tube safety intensified yesterday when it was announced that LU and one of its former signals managers are to be prosecuted by the HSE for allowing dangerous working practices during maintenance work on the Central line.

      "body": "<p>Before the current crowing over Moscow's untruths and public relations blunders about the Kursk submarine disaster strays into a hubristic never-never land, a little sober reflection on Britain's own record of official lying is necessary.</p> <p>Twelve days of deceit and cack-handed public relations from the Russian authorities have certainly fuelled popular anger about the Murmansk tragedy, while western commentators have blamed the legacy of Soviet secrecy.</p> <p>But it was only last week that British claims about the scale of Serb killings in Kosovo were shown to be false. The death toll was likely to be less than 3,000, war crimes investigators revealed, rather than the 10,000-plus insisted on by the Foreign Office at the time. That followed the leaked internal Ministry of Defence report that most British bombs dropped on Yugoslavia missed their targets, contrary to earlier boasts of devastating accuracy. And last month Lord Gilbert, defence minister during the Kosovo war, told the House of Commons that the Rambouillet terms offered to Serb leaders had been \"absolutely intolerable\" and designed to provoke war, a proposition ridiculed by the British government last year.</p> <p>Throughout the past decade, official Anglo-American lies about Iraq have been two-a-penny. During the Gulf war it was said that the al-Amiriya bomb shelter in Baghdad, where hundreds of civilians were incinerated, had been a military command centre; that the pulverised Biladi baby-milk factory was really a biological weapons plant; and that Iraqi soliders in Kuwait had ejected babies from hospital incubators. All these tales were later accepted as untrue.

      "bodyText": "Before the current crowing over Moscow's untruths and public relations blunders about the Kursk submarine disaster strays into a hubristic never-never land, a little sober reflection on Britain's own record of official lying is necessary. Twelve days of deceit and cack-handed public relations from the Russian authorities have certainly fuelled popular anger about the Murmansk tragedy, while western commentators have blamed the legacy of Soviet secrecy. But it was only last week that British claims about the scale of Serb killings in Kosovo were shown to be false. The death toll was likely to be less than 3,000, war crimes investigators revealed, rather than the 10,000-plus insisted on by the Foreign Office at the time. That followed the leaked internal Ministry of Defence report that most British bombs dropped on Yugoslavia missed their targets, contrary to earlier boasts of devastating accuracy. And last month Lord Gilbert, defence minister during the Kosovo war, told the House of Commons that the Rambouillet terms offered to Serb leaders had been \"absolutely intolerable\" and designed to provoke war, a proposition ridiculed by the British government last year. Throughout the past decade, official Anglo-American lies about Iraq have been two-a-penny. During the Gulf war it was said that the al-Amiriya bomb shelter in Baghdad, where hundreds of civilians were incinerated, had been a military command centre; that the pulverised Biladi baby-milk factory was really a biological weapons plant; and that Iraqi soliders in Kuwait had ejected babies from hospital incubators. All these tales were later accepted as untrue. More recently, there was Robin Cook's fictitious story, repeatedly used to shore up Labour support for the Desert Fox bombing campaign against Iraq 18 months ago, that a 16-year-old Iraqi boy had been incarcerated since the age of five for throwing stones at a portrait of Saddam Hussein. In general, however, British officialdom prefer to avoid what they call \"direct lies\" wherever possible.

It has also taken bitterly resisted public inquiries to expose the truth about Britain's secret supply of arms-related equipment to Saddam Hussein in the 80s and - although the full truth has yet to emerge - the shooting of 14 unarmed demonstrators by British soldiers on Bloody Sunday in Derry in January 1972. Such cases emphasise the effectiveness and sophistication of British official deceit: born of centuries of diplomatic evasion and a need-to-know culture of secrecy.

      "bodyText": "Sierra Leone's rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF) said yesterday, a day after changing its leader, that it would cooperate with UN troops on disarmament, raising hopes of a renewal of the peace process. An agreement to end Sierra Leone's civil war was signed in Lome in July 1999 but fell apart in May when RUF fighters captured peacekeepers from the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (Unamsil). \"The RUF high command calls for the early deployment of Unamsil troops from the sub-region in our areas of operation in Sierra Leone and assures [the UN] of our readiness to cooperate with them in order to ensure the success of the DDR [disarmament] programme in particular and the peace process in general,\" the RUF said in a statement. On Monday, the Sierra Leone government announced that the RUF had chosen battlefield commander Issa Sesay as leader, replacing Foday Sankoh who is under arrest and faces trial for human rights offences. The news was relayed to Mr Sankoh on Monday by the presidents of Nigeria and Mali, acting as mediators, and they said he had accepted the move. The RUF high command pledged in its statement, issued in Monrovia, capital of Liberia, to work with the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) to achieve peace in Sierra Leone. It said it hoped the Sierra Leone government would \"fulfil its total obligations under the Lome accord\". That agreement brought the RUF into government, giving Mr Sankoh the status of vice-president. But the disarmament process proved slow and the RUF still controlled much of the country, when the fighting broke out in May. President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah pledged to release 171 RUF fighters in response to the replacement of Mr Sankoh and called on the new RUF leadership to cooperate on the disarmament programme. Government forces, backed by a more muscular approach from the UN, have forced the RUF onto the defensive in recent weeks.",

      "body": "<p>Hamlets come in all shapes and sizes. They can be lean and attenuated like David Warner and Jonathan Pryce. They can be short and mercurial like Mark Rylance and Anton Lesser. They can be mellifluously poetic like Michael Pennington and Derek Jacobi or prosaically brutal like Nicol Williamson. But two of the more unusual Hamlets are about to be unveiled: at the National Theatre we have a Hamlet in the pleasingly rotund shape of Simon Russell Beale, while at the Edinburgh festival the role is taken by Angela Winkler, a sinuous German brunette. </p> <p>No one need be surprised by the idea of a female Hamlet: women have been playing the Prince for generations. I saw Frances de la Tour make a vigorous Hamlet at the Half Moon; if anything, she underplayed the character's femininity. No such accusation was levelled at Sarah Bernhardt's Hamlet, which arrived at the Adelphi in 1899 and which Max Beerbohm described as \"tr\u00e8s grande dame\". Before that, in England, there was the obscure Mrs Bandmann Palmer, who toured the Northern circuits and, according to JC Trewin, was said to have acted with melodramatic force, \"though because of rheumatism she had trouble rising from her knees\". On screen in 1920 there was the Danish actress Asta Nielsen, who revealed that Hamlet was actually a woman reared as a boy for dynastic reasons. </p> <p>Winkler is not only the latest in a long line: she's a great actress in her own right. She was part of Peter Stein's original Berlin Schaubuhne company in the 1970s, has been in many European films and became the mesmeric centre of Peter Zadek's Berliner Ensemble production of Pinter's Moonlight. As Bel, the wife of bedridden Andy, she was full of sensuous affection and extra-sensory intelligence. While soothing her dying husband, she seemed strangely alert to the ethereal presence of their daughter and registered anguish at the suffering of their estranged sons. Even the dead and departed became for her a living presence. </p> <p>That is clearly a prerequisite for anyone playing Hamlet; and Winkler's performance, which I caught in Hanover on its last stop before Edinburgh, is characterised by its extra ordinary imaginative sympathy and emotional directness. Winkler makes no obvious attempt to impersonate a man. She wears tights, a long black smock that comes down to her knees and retains her own long hair that she frequently brushes out of her eyes. She does not adopt a surface maleness; instead she absorbs Hamlet's emotions into her own personality. </p> <p>Oscar Wilde said there is no such thing as Shakespeare's Hamlet. What he meant is that the role is coloured by the individuality of each particular performer. And what Winkler brings out - in a way that no man I have ever seen quite has - is Hamlet's enormous capacity for love, a capacity that is constantly baffled and frustrated. With the Ghost, whose presence is announced by jangling finger-bells, Winkler is all filial devotion. Her passion for Annett Renneberg's much-abused Ophelia is also palpable and explicit: during the Play scene they sit together endlessly fondling and stroking each other. Even Hamlet's asperity towards Gertrude is offset by Winkler's affection: in the closet scene she nuzzles her mother's breast as if seeking reassurance and warmth. But Winkler's unused capacity for love is not exclusively sexual: in the course of the duel, she offers her hand to Laertes with courtly grace, only to find herself cruelly rebuffed. </p> <p>Cross-gender casting works in a variety of ways. Men, I've noticed, delight in identifying with women and in highlighting a skittish sexiness: that was certainly true of Adrian Lester's Rosalind and Mark Rylance's Cleopatra. Women, instead of impersonating maleness, universalise the character: that certainly applies to Vanessa Redgrave's Prospero and now Winkler's Hamlet. But Winkler also suggests that the consequence of Hamlet's thwarted love is a desperate desire to communicate. In consequence the soliloquies are delivered downstage with Winkler desperately raking the front stalls in order to make eye contact. It's as if, in the dislocated world of Elsinore, we become her only friends: the only people to whom she can unburden her inmost thoughts. Winkler fully vindicates the idea of a female Hamlet: she proves that solitude, despair, ethical doubts about revenge and a sense of betrayed love are qualities that transcend gender. </p> <p>I suspect the real controversy in Edinburgh will rage not around her performance but around Zadek's production. He's a brilliantly unorthodox director who has the capacity to scrape off the barnacles of Shakespearean tradition. I recall a German Merchant of Venice he brought to Edinburgh in which Gert Voss's besuited, merchant-banker Shylock was barely distinguishable from the Christians. I remember with even greater pleasure his witty, subversive Antony and Cleopatra in which Voss and Eva Mattes (the Gertrude in Hamlet) played the leads as outrageous narcissists slapping on their makeup before going into battle. </p> <p>Zadek's Hamlet is similarly unromantic. He has moved a long way from CE Montague's vision of the play as \"a monstrous Gothic castle of a poem full of baffled half-lights and glooms\". Instead, the basic set is an industrial container, a huge, metallic rectangular box that swivels round to reveal the varying facets of Elsinore. It is pragmatic, functional and deliberately un-beautiful. But, however one responds to the set, Zadek has an enormous capacity for animating individual characters and scenes. I've never before seen an Ophelia so incessantly mauled and pawed by father and brother as if she were a sexual toy. Zadek also solves the perennial problem posed by the Play scene: why on earth does it take Claudius so long to realise its dangerous content? Zadek answers the question by treating it initially as knockabout drag comedy, all twanging bra straps and galumphing movement, that only gradually turns into sinister mimicry of reality. </p> <p>This is a deeply German Hamlet: one that strips the play of its romantic accretions and offers a running directorial commentary as well as a full-blooded realisation. But at its heart lies an astonishing performance by Winkler. She gives us hints of Hamlet's ferocity, not least in her feral snarls, and of his manic-depressive moods: on \"the play's the thing\" Winkler leaps in the air as if she has cracked an insoluble problem. But, above all, she proves that Hamlet as a role depends less on the particularities of gender than on the width of sensibility. I've seen many more lethal Hamlets than Winkler's but few so endowed with such generosity of spirit or largeness of heart. </p> <p>Hamlet is at the Royal Lyceum, Edinburgh (0131-473 2000), from August 30-September 2.</p>",

The study, by researchers at Glasgow University and Leicester Royal Infirmary, also found that women from more deprived areas tended to suffer from a more aggressive form of the disease, with faster growing tumours. The research, which will be published in the British Journal of Cancer, has concluded that unhealthy diets and smoking are partly to blame and said it was vital for women to have regular smear tests and to increase their intake of fresh fruit and vegetables. There are 300 new cases of cancer of the cervix every year in Scotland. Researchers say that vitamins in fruit and vegetables mop up harmful and potentially cancer-causing chemicals, and smoking reduces the levels of betacarotene, which prevents a virus present in many women from growing into cancer cells. Professor David Hole, one of the report's authors, said: \"Certainly the role of vitamins and betacarotene, which are the substances we get from fresh fruit and vegetables, might be quite important in controlling the rate at which these tumours grow.\" Professor Hole said the study, which was funded by the Scottish Office home health department, was set up to establish why some patients had larger tumours, and looked at issues such as diagnostic delay or a delay in patients seeking help.

Defence spokesman Iain Duncan Smith once again voiced Conservative party concern about prisoner releases.</p> <p>But the Tories are in a double bind as far as the peace process is concerned. Not only are they hemmed in by the bipartisanship that has characterised this latest attempt to answer the Irish question. They also have an awkward relationship with unionism and Ulster. The party has bred some of unionism's most articulate defenders, such as Ian Gow and Enoch Powell. Today, there are still many Tory journalists, MPs and thinkers who are passionate supporters of the union. At the same time, the Tory party has to acknowledge that it has played its full part in appeasement, from the secret Whitelaw talks with the IRA in the 70s, through to Thatcher's Anglo-Irish agreement and Major's Downing Street declaration which led directly to prisoner releases.</p> <p>The Tories are having to think hard and fast about Ulster. It is an issue that is breaking out again, and may be prominent at their conference this year. Recently the Tories have been thrown a challenge from the right of their party. The Centre for Policy Studies, still the foremost Conservative thinktank, has published a pamphlet called The Price of Peace. Its author is Michael Gove, the biographer of Portillo and an articulate polemicist of the right. He argues that the peace process has taken us down a dangerous and erroneous path.</p> <p>Among the Tories there is a mood for a harder line on the peace process. Many who originally felt concern have had their fears confirmed by the hijacking of the peace process to Blairism and the attendant political correctness which the Tories love to hate and are keen to highlight. Gove gives grist to his audience's mill in this regard, focusing on the work of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Committee and its concern for the right of transsexuals. Blair's Ulster has become a microcosm of Blair's Britain, a land of less RUC and more PC.</p> <p>Gove's thesis goes wider. It deserves to be considered seriously by liberals and conservatives alike. The peace process has seen democracy subverted by violence. We have had the concession that terrorists should be allowed to take part in elections. We have had the further erosion that they should do so without promising to renounce violence or decommission any weapons.</p> <p>Gove's analysis shows that, in an effort to achieve \"balance\" and \"representation\", the system of designating parties as nationalist or unionist entrenches sectarianism and will prevent the development of parties of the left or the right. The further guarantee of ministerial portfolios for all parties in the assembly enforces a coalition that the people have not necessarily voted for, and removes from these ministers any sense of accountability.</p> <p>The solution, in Gove's eyes, is to abandon the peace process and substitute for it a strategy of \"resolute security action\"; the ending of prisoner releases; the banning of any party still associated with the principle of violence from participation in the peace process. More broadly, he shows the dangers inherent in appeasement. It is one thing to seek peace, another to put into effect methods of government that one would not contemplate elsewhere in one's country. Peace may be achieved in the short term, but at the price of the long-term infection of the body politic.</p> <p>Gove's thesis is not for everyone. But it is a timely reminder of the implications of short-term decisions, ill-thought-out compromise and the belief that only one path can be followed. The reason that Gove's analysis will play so well with the Tories is that it echoes both the appeasement process of the 30s and the appeasement of the 21st century, namely the inevitable march to the euro.</p> <p>There is a case for a principled politician to condemn the peace process. There is room for a broad cross-party consensus. The trouble is that most of us do not think long or deeply about Ulster. For many English people it is and will remain a foreign land. It will not feature in any opinion polls' top 10 issues that concern voters. Most people are glad that the bombing has stopped on the mainland. And every day that this remains the case the peace process will command public support.</p> <p>For these reasons, expect the Tories to continue to snipe, but not to perform a volte-face.</p> <p>\u0095 Ed Vaizey is a Conservative</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",

Many who originally felt concern have had their fears confirmed by the hijacking of the peace process to Blairism and the attendant political correctness which the Tories love to hate and are keen to highlight. Gove gives grist to his audience's mill in this regard, focusing on the work of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Committee and its concern for the right of transsexuals. Blair's Ulster has become a microcosm of Blair's Britain, a land of less RUC and more PC. Gove's thesis goes wider. It deserves to be considered seriously by liberals and conservatives alike. The peace process has seen democracy subverted by violence. We have had the concession that terrorists should be allowed to take part in elections. We have had the further erosion that they should do so without promising to renounce violence or decommission any weapons. Gove's analysis shows that, in an effort to achieve \"balance\" and \"representation\", the system of designating parties as nationalist or unionist entrenches sectarianism and will prevent the development of parties of the left or the right. The further guarantee of ministerial portfolios for all parties in the assembly enforces a coalition that the people have not necessarily voted for, and removes from these ministers any sense of accountability. The solution, in Gove's eyes, is to abandon the peace process and substitute for it a strategy of \"resolute security action\"; the ending of prisoner releases; the banning of any party still associated with the principle of violence from participation in the peace process. More broadly, he shows the dangers inherent in appeasement. It is one thing to seek peace, another to put into effect methods of government that one would not contemplate elsewhere in one's country. Peace may be achieved in the short term, but at the price of the long-term infection of the body politic. Gove's thesis is not for everyone. But it is a timely reminder of the implications of short-term decisions, ill-thought-out compromise and the belief that only one path can be followed. The reason that Gove's analysis will play so well with the Tories is that it echoes both the appeasement process of the 30s and the appeasement of the 21st century, namely the inevitable march to the euro. There is a case for a principled politician to condemn the peace process. There is room for a broad cross-party consensus. The trouble is that most of us do not think long or deeply about Ulster. For many English people it is and will remain a foreign land. It will not feature in any opinion polls' top 10 issues that concern voters. Most people are glad that the bombing has stopped on the mainland. And every day that this remains the case the peace process will command public support. For these reasons, expect the Tories to continue to snipe, but not to perform a volte-face. \u0095 Ed Vaizey is a Conservative comment@theguardian.com",

Scottish Opera got halfway through a cycle in the early 90s, but a lack of funds forced its abandonment; the future of this one, though, commissioned by the festival and sponsored by the Bank of Scotland, seems far more secure. After this Rheingold, Die Walk\u00fcre and Siegfried will be presented at the festival in the next two years; the last instalment, G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung, will open in Scottish Opera's spring season in 2003, with two complete cycles to follow at that summer's festival. </p> <p>The finance may be in place, then, but that doesn't mean this is a lavish, no expense-spared production, far from it. The director Tim Albery and designer Hildegard Bechtler have come up with a spare, airy concept, made up of a number of discreet elements that doubtless will return again in different guises: no prizes for predicting that the huge slab of slate on which Wotan and his wife Fricka are sleeping at the opening of the second scene of Rheingold might well serve as Brunnhilde's rock in Walk\u00fcre and Siegfried, for instance, or that the carapace-like flats, speckled with the night sky on one surface, which are deployed to define the different spaces of the gods and the Nibelungs here, will fulfill the same role in future instalments. But it all works, that's the main thing; the action moves lucidly, Albery's production maintains a tight grip of the narrative and on the importance of what every character is saying at every moment, while the stage pictures are often elegantly beautiful. </p> <p>The Rhinemaidens, real temptresses in stockings and suspenders, cavort in a Rhine suggested by abstract, translucent waves, around which they lead the bespectacled, bedraggled Alberich a merry dance. A skyscraper Valhalla gleams in a display case when Wotan is trying to wriggle out of his contract with the giants Fasolt and Fafner, who arrive in a silhouette head, their faces visible through its eye-holes; when Fafner murders his partner in the final scene, one eye shuts. The transformations are simply achieved - a monstrous claw appears around the edge of the proscenium when Alberich turns himself into a dragon - and though there is no rainbow bridge for the Gods' entrance into Valhalla, a series of gorgeously lit cubicles descend, into which they all solemnly arrange themselves like a Greek frieze. </p> <p>Within this framework, every character is sharply defined. The gods are beskirted; Wotan sports a jacket and tie above his, and when Alberich is wielding his power through the ring he dares to wear one too. Loge, half god, half man, is a cross between Rupert Bear and Doctor Who; the giants are warehouse men, with Fasolt as shop steward determined to get a fair deal for their labours. Every image is thoughtful, and potent, nothing jars or intrudes, nothing is fussy. </p> <p>There's no fussiness in the performance either. Richard Armstrong conducts a fleet, lively performance, quite devoid of bombast or unnecessary rhetoric; he makes it clear that Rheingold is the beginning of a long musical journey, and the real weight and depth are to come later, and provides a flexible, supportive platform for this very musical cast. </p> <p>There are no great Wagnerian voices on show here, though Matthew Best, as a wracked and devious Wotan might well mature into one. Peter Sidhom's Alberich is both sly and wretched, more than usually sympathetic, Anne Mason's handbag-wielding Fricka is not to be denied. Peter Bronder's Loge, a gift of a part, makes every acidulated aside count; Inka Rinn, Marianne Anderson and Leah Marian Jones are a suitably sexy trio of Rhinemaidens, Carsten Stabell and Markus Hollop an all-too-believable pair of jobs-worth giants. Solid, intelligent performances all round, and a very good start to a project that promises more riches and insights to come. </p> <p>At the Edinburgh Festival Theatre (0131-473 2000) tonight, Saturday, and Monday, then touring in the autumn.</p>",

While US stock market values have increased five-fold in a decade, with half of all shares owned by 1% of the people, welfare has been cut to a five-year lifetime limit. With 40% of the people not covered by medical insurance, Medicare for the elderly is being cut by $115bn - and the Republicans promise far worse to come.</p> <p>Virtually all the income gains of the last five years have been enjoyed by the top 20% of the population.

Bush is terrifying - in hock to oil and arms, promising a $1.3 trillion tax cut to the exclusive benefit of the top few. Gore is better.

There, at the North Pole, on March 17, 1959, a wind-scoured expanse of flat snow and hummocks was being broken into from below. With an eerie lack of sound, a huge black shape burst through the ice and settled, long, featureless and menacing, in the wasteland. </p> <p>That was the day that Commander James Calvert and his men, the crew of the US nuclear submarine Skate, made history by being the first to test the thickness of the ice at the top of the world in the most dramatic way possible, with the hull of the boat they relied on to get them back home. </p> <p>Since then, scores of submarines, including many from Britain, have visited the pole this way. A long, sometimes anxious, often boring, cruise under the ice; the search for a way up: a crack in the ice, known as a lead, an area of open water - a polynya - or a stretch where the frozen layer between water and sky is thin enough to break; the call to action stations; and the careful easing of the vessel up to the surface, sometimes with heart-stopping sounds of cracking and straining as the ice yields. And then, for the Royal Navy at least, a spot of football at the pole. Or, as has been known, the best cricket playable in three layers of clothing and Arctic mittens. </p> <p>These cruises were for the sake of apocalyptic wars to come. The measuring of the thickness of the ice by sonar as the submarines hummed through the dark waters was just a by-product. But as scientists began to analyse the results of these measurements, they noticed a curious thing: year after year, the ice was becoming thinner. Amid fears of global warming, with the cold war gone, it starts to look as if the main legacy of those under-ice voyages will be the warning of a completely different apocalypse, equally man-made and equally destructive - the floods and famines of a world grilled under a blanket of greenhouse gases. </p> <p>Earlier this month, a group of American tourists were startled, when they reached the North Pole on board a Russian icebreaker, to find that there was no ice to break. The pole, in our imaginations a flat white sheet scoured by twisting lines of wind-blown snow, was open water. Gulls flew overhead. The nearest stretch of ice capable of bearing the weight of the tour party was six miles away. </p> <p>\"There was a sense of alarm,\" said Dr James McCarthy, an oceanographer and one of the tourists. \"Global warming was real, and we were seeing its effects for the first time that far north.\" </p> <p>Arctic specialists read fearful media accounts of the icebreaker tour with mixed feelings. On one hand, they knew that open water at the North Pole is not, in fact, unusual - as the repeated submarine surfacings there show. Even in winter, the winds which keep the ice constantly moving across the sea of the Arctic basin cause cracks, ridges and large polynyas to appear. The Skate surfaced in 1959 through a lead of open water which had recently frozen over. </p> <p>Yet they knew, too, that the tourists had witnessed something new - the thinness of the ice across the whole Arctic region, where historically it has been up to 3m thick. The evidence is mounting. The US Navy has provided its data, the Royal Navy has just released its last classified figures for analysis, and the Russians are rumoured to be preparing to put their information on the market. From 1300km up, satellites are able to measure ice thickness with incredible accuracy - to within 10cm. All the signs are that the sea ice over the Arctic is melting, and in 50 years' time, in summer, there could be no ice there at all. </p> <p>\"The average ice thickness in summer has decreased by 40% between the 1970s and now,\" said Peter Wadhams of the Cambridge-based Scott Polar Research Institute, who is a veteran of Arctic submarine voyages. \"That's a pretty major decrease. And we're looking at satellite images showing the area of ice to be shrinking too - that's been going down by 5% a decade. At that rate, it will have vanished in 50 years.\" </p> <p>An ice-free Arctic. Should we care? If all the sea ice melts, it won't affect sea levels: an ice cube melting in a drink does not make the drink overflow. Merchant ships would be able to cut almost 5,000 miles off the Europe-Japan sea route by zipping across the North Pole. Oil prospectors and trawlers would move in. Siberians and Canadians would cash in. But it would spell disaster for creatures such as the polar bear; it would mean the end of one of the world's last true wildernesses. And for humankind, it could be the beginning of a great climatic catastrophe. </p> <p>The North Pole has always inspired passion in scientists. The passion to get there first, and the passion to be right about what is happening in the remotest and most mysterious of places. The man long accepted as the first to have reached the pole, Robert Peary, turned out to have wanted the honour so passionately that he lied - it now seems likely that he never got closer than 100 miles from the pole. The first to make it was probably a Soviet airman, Ivan Papanin, and he didn't make it until 1937. </p> <p>The current debate about the causes of Arctic ice-thinning is, appropriately, one of the fiercest and most keenly watched in the whole field of climate change. Computer models of the world's climate predict that if changes take place, they will take place in the Arctic earlier and faster than anywhere else on the planet. The question under dispute is simple: is global warming to blame for the watery pole, or is it part of a separate weather cycle, whereby the ice shrinks and thickens in a regular way over decades? </p> <p>Johnny Johannessen, of the Nansen Environmental and Remote Sensing Centre in Bergen, Norway - where scientists have predicted the demise of the Arctic summer sea ice in 50 years - said: \"It's a challenge to be able to pin down how much ice thickness is changing as a result of global warming and how much is due to atmospheric conditions which, we know, undergo huge changes in the Arctic from decade to decade.\" </p> <p>Dr Wadhams said he was convinced that global warming was the cause. In particular, the ice was being undermined from below by warmer seas. The idea that a change in the winds which shift the sea ice would simply \"flip\" the cycle back to a rethickening of the ice was, he said, unconvincing. \"The balance of probability is that this is a real global-warming effect. It's not going to go back.\" </p> <p>If global warming really is found to be responsible for the melting of the Arctic, it has two sets of consequences - one direct, the other demonstrative. If scientists can point to a shrinking skein of ice floes where valiant explorers once walked with huskies, it will help them to wake up the world to the powerful changes that man-made climate change is capable of making to all our lives. </p> <p>Directly, the disappearance of the shiny white ice at the pole means the loss, for the planet, of a huge reflector, beaming the sun's heat back at it. Open water is darker and absorbs heat better. In other words, the loss of the ice would add to the rise in global temperatures. </p> <p>Another direct consequence is a particularly ugly one for Britain. Global warming is predicted to mean steadily rising temperatures for our islands, bringing Mediterranean balm to the south. But within 100 years, this could change. With the melting of the Arctic ice, some models say, the existing circulation of cold and hot, fresh and salt water in the Atlantic would be dramatically violated. The gulf stream, the current of warm water which keeps our temperatures higher than they should be so far north, would falter and be turned back south of Ireland. Temperatures would sink till they were lower than they are now. </p> <p>As a first, early sign of how global warming can bring real, swift and disturbing change to the world we grew up in, the thinning of the Arctic ice appears as an early warning light, closer to home and bigger than the inundation of little island nations, more clear-cut than the doubtful premise that global warming means more storms. </p> <p>The melting Arctic will not bring flooding directly. But it looks like a sign that melting glaciers in the ancient, kilometres-thick ice caps of Greenland and AntArctica will. Sea levels are predicted to rise by 70cm in the coming century, putting the people of low-lying countries like Bangladesh at ever greater risk of disaster. Rising temperatures will render swathes of semi-arid African land desert, and lead to increased rainfall elsewhere, meaning greater floods. </p> <p>Sceptics of global warming point to the lack of reliable weather records going back more than a century, arguing that it is impossible to distinguish between natural cycles in the weather and man-made changes. Yet examination of ice and sediment samples going back hundreds of thousands of years suggests that, in fact, the recent rises in temperatures are an aberration. </p> <p>Accepted theories about the wobbles in the Earth's orbit, which are thought to cause ice ages, suggest that we can expect our next ice age in 25,000 years time, and that we are approaching the peak of natural warmth in the ice-age cycle. The difference in average global temperature between getting vineyards in Yorkshire and getting glaciers in Scottish glens is very small - only four degrees celsius. In other words, by adding a few degrees to the planet's natural temperature at the time when it is peaking anyway, we are moving into wholly unpredictable territory. </p> <p>Politically and - some scientists fear - practically, there may be little we can do but try to help protect developing countries, which are likely to suffer the hardest, from the consequences of global warming. For the next few generations at least, western Europe and North America are set to experience climate change that is dramatic enough to notice but not dangerous enough to be beyond management, making it still possible to ignore the plight of nations and ecosystems which are more at risk. </p> <p>Not that the changes won't be brought home to our shores in painful ways. \"The 1953 floods on the east coast of England were caused by storm surges,\" said Wadhams. \"If there are higher sea levels to begin with, it will be worse. The chances are there are going to be some disastrous floods on the east coast in the next few years. If I were living near the coast in Suffolk or Essex, I'd really be a bit worried.\" </p> <p><strong>Global warning:</strong>What will happen if the world keeps getting hotter </p> <p>* Increased risk of flooding in Bangladesh: already ravaged by periodic floods, loss of life and property gets worse as the sea level rises. Nile delta also at risk. </p> <p>* Famine in Africa: semi-arid regions in sub-Saharan Africa turn to desert, making the food situation for some of the world's poorest countries worse. </p> <p>* Disease moves north: mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria, yellow fever, dengue fever and encephalitis spread into new territories. </p> <p>* Trouble in New York: ferocious storms become a regular occurrence. Parts of Manhattan experience frequent floods. </p> <p>* The map changes: the Florida everglades are inundated, changing the shape of the US. </p> <p>* Danger in England: rising sea levels combine with storm surges to overcome the sea defences on the east coast. </p> <p>* Birds die: an estimated 24m geese, sandpipers, dunlins and stints have to find new breeding grounds or perish, due to forestation of the Arctic tundra. </p> <p>* Polar bears starve: as global warming melts the Arctic ice, the bears have less chance to fatten up on the seals they catch through the ice - their weight plummets and cubs starve.

      "bodyText": "Had there been anyone there to watch, they would have thought that some gigantic, terrible sea creature was trying to break through the ice. There, at the North Pole, on March 17, 1959, a wind-scoured expanse of flat snow and hummocks was being broken into from below. With an eerie lack of sound, a huge black shape burst through the ice and settled, long, featureless and menacing, in the wasteland. That was the day that Commander James Calvert and his men, the crew of the US nuclear submarine Skate, made history by being the first to test the thickness of the ice at the top of the world in the most dramatic way possible, with the hull of the boat they relied on to get them back home. Since then, scores of submarines, including many from Britain, have visited the pole this way. A long, sometimes anxious, often boring, cruise under the ice; the search for a way up: a crack in the ice, known as a lead, an area of open water - a polynya - or a stretch where the frozen layer between water and sky is thin enough to break; the call to action stations; and the careful easing of the vessel up to the surface, sometimes with heart-stopping sounds of cracking and straining as the ice yields. And then, for the Royal Navy at least, a spot of football at the pole. Or, as has been known, the best cricket playable in three layers of clothing and Arctic mittens. These cruises were for the sake of apocalyptic wars to come. The measuring of the thickness of the ice by sonar as the submarines hummed through the dark waters was just a by-product.

      "body": "<p>The ultimate justification for this summer's News of the World campaign \"outing\" sex offenders was that the paper was articulating a public anxiety with which both politicians and professionals have failed to come to terms. </p> <p>In the face of ugly scenes of vigilante action and the News of the World's humiliating decision to stop publishing its weekly photo-gallery of sex offenders, the paper's editor, Rebekah Wade, took comfort in the idea that her actions had overwhelming public support. </p> <p>Media commentators who tut-tutted as vigilante mobs drove people out of their homes then went on to praise Ms Wade, saying that she had understood public feeling about released paedophiles in a way that no other newspaper editor had managed to do. Some went further and said that she had tapped so brilliantly into this public mood that if she managed to push her paper's circulation back above 4m then, in some way, the whole thing had been a success. </p> <p>The News of the World is keen to paint the entire episode as a great victory. Last Sunday its front page trumpeted \"82% of Britain wants Sarah's law\". This was based on the findings of an exclusive Mori poll for the paper. They claimed that the poll revealed \"huge support for our crusade to protect the nation's kids\" and \"for an urgent shake-up of the country's outdated and ineffective sex laws\". </p> <p>Even in the dismal history of newspaper coverage of specially commissioned opinion polls, this must stand out as one of the most remarkable pieces of selective reporting and amnesia in the cause of self-justification. </p> <p>The evidence for this is on the polling company's own website, <a href=\"http://www.mori.com\">mori.com</a>, where the full results are set out so that the pollsters can be absolved of any charge of fixing the results. Mori interviewed 1,004 adults by telephone between August 17-18 and the data has been weighted to the known population profile. </p> <p>The first piece of evidence lies in the public's response to question 10: \"As you may know, there has recently been controversy over the publication by the News of the World of names and photographs of people convicted of sex crimes against children. Do you think the News of the World was right or wrong to pursue this 'naming and shaming' policy?\" </p> <p>The results - right 38%, wrong 51%, neither 6% and don't know 5% - were clear cut. A majority of the public does not think that the News of the World was right to pursue its naming and shaming policy. Perhaps it is unsurprising that the paper failed to report this part of the poll. </p> <p>The misrepresentation in the second exhibit is slightly more subtle but in some ways even more damaging.

      "bodyText": "The ultimate justification for this summer's News of the World campaign \"outing\" sex offenders was that the paper was articulating a public anxiety with which both politicians and professionals have failed to come to terms. In the face of ugly scenes of vigilante action and the News of the World's humiliating decision to stop publishing its weekly photo-gallery of sex offenders, the paper's editor, Rebekah Wade, took comfort in the idea that her actions had overwhelming public support. Media commentators who tut-tutted as vigilante mobs drove people out of their homes then went on to praise Ms Wade, saying that she had understood public feeling about released paedophiles in a way that no other newspaper editor had managed to do. Some went further and said that she had tapped so brilliantly into this public mood that if she managed to push her paper's circulation back above 4m then, in some way, the whole thing had been a success. The News of the World is keen to paint the entire episode as a great victory. Last Sunday its front page trumpeted \"82% of Britain wants Sarah's law\". This was based on the findings of an exclusive Mori poll for the paper. They claimed that the poll revealed \"huge support for our crusade to protect the nation's kids\" and \"for an urgent shake-up of the country's outdated and ineffective sex laws\". Even in the dismal history of newspaper coverage of specially commissioned opinion polls, this must stand out as one of the most remarkable pieces of selective reporting and amnesia in the cause of self-justification. The evidence for this is on the polling company's own website, mori.com, where the full results are set out so that the pollsters can be absolved of any charge of fixing the results. Mori interviewed 1,004 adults by telephone between August 17-18 and the data has been weighted to the known population profile. The first piece of evidence lies in the public's response to question 10: \"As you may know, there has recently been controversy over the publication by the News of the World of names and photographs of people convicted of sex crimes against children. Do you think the News of the World was right or wrong to pursue this 'naming and shaming' policy?\" The results - right 38%, wrong 51%, neither 6% and don't know 5% - were clear cut. A majority of the public does not think that the News of the World was right to pursue its naming and shaming policy. Perhaps it is unsurprising that the paper failed to report this part of the poll. The misrepresentation in the second exhibit is slightly more subtle but in some ways even more damaging. The News of the World printed a large chart purporting to show the full results to the first question asked: \"What, if anything, do you think could be done to improve the safety of children in your area?\" Mori's actual results were illuminating about the public's fears. Top of the list came more policing (backed by 24%), followed by restrictions on speed limits/traffic control (23%) and more safe areas/parks for children to play in (16%). These were followed by better parenting/responsibility for the safety/care of children (13%); more clubs/places to keep children/teenagers off the streets (11%); all adults/people should be aware/have more interest (7%); better community spirit/projects (4%); more education on safety/self defence (also 4%); more parking wardens (3%); and then public naming of convicted paedophiles (3%). Finally there were tougher sentences for child attackers (3%); bringing back the death penalty (2%); and the electronic tagging of convicted paedophiles (2%). The News of the World chart clearly showed that more policing and more restrictions on speeding motorists were what the public put at the top of their list of what would make their children's lives safer. However, when it came down to the lowly tenth position in the public's solutions - just below the need for more parking wardens - the fact that only 3% of the public mentioned the public naming of convicted paedophiles (the central demand of the News of the World campaign) was strangely omitted. The final piece of evidence lies in the main question, which claims that 82% support for Sarah's law. In the paper this was reported as having read: \"Do you support Sarah's law?\" But the Mori results show that the full question was: \"The 'Sarah's law' campaign wants to introduce a new law in Britain that would ensure every parent's right to controlled access to information about individuals in their neighbourhood who may pose a risk to their children.

In his latest work however the most terrible of the enfants who shook up the British art scene in the early 1990s has preserved a far more endangered species; traditional painting. </p> <p>In a piece titled Contemplating a Self Portrait (as a Pharmacist), Hirst has taken the trappings of the figurative painter; easel, canvas, smock, palette, brushes and tubes of oil paint, and encased them in a series of glass boxes.</p> <p>The piece is, according to an accompanying text by Gemma de Cruz, \"a confessional, romantic work\" that expresses Mr Hirst's love of traditional painting and his frustration at being able to work only in a \"mechanical\" style. Mr Hirst, who is holidaying with friends in Spain, was unavailable to comment on this interpretation. </p> <p>The previously unseen work will go on show next month in Ant Noises 2, the latest exhibition of work from the collection of Britain's foremost contemporary collector and patron, Charles Saatchi. </p> <p>Other Hirst works that will go on show at the exhibition, which opens on September 13 at the Saatchi Gallery, north London, include Horror at Home, an oversize ashtray filled with cigarette butts and detritus; The Last Supper, a series of screen prints of food; and Zeolite Mixture, one of his dot paintings. </p> <p>Earlier this year Mr Saatchi paid \u00a31m for Hirst's sculpture Hymn, a 20ft bronze model of an anatomical toy originally designed for children. </p> <p>Other artists exhibiting previously unseen work include many of the leading lights of the Young British Artists movement that Hirst so flamboyantly led. </p> <p>Tracey Emin exhibits photographs of herself in a 14ft weatherboard beach hut in Whitstable she bought with fellow artist Sarah Lucas in 1992.

      "bodyText": "Damien Hirst has exhibited sheep, cows and most famously a tiger shark embalmed in formaldehyde. In his latest work however the most terrible of the enfants who shook up the British art scene in the early 1990s has preserved a far more endangered species; traditional painting. In a piece titled Contemplating a Self Portrait (as a Pharmacist), Hirst has taken the trappings of the figurative painter; easel, canvas, smock, palette, brushes and tubes of oil paint, and encased them in a series of glass boxes. The piece is, according to an accompanying text by Gemma de Cruz, \"a confessional, romantic work\" that expresses Mr Hirst's love of traditional painting and his frustration at being able to work only in a \"mechanical\" style. Mr Hirst, who is holidaying with friends in Spain, was unavailable to comment on this interpretation. The previously unseen work will go on show next month in Ant Noises 2, the latest exhibition of work from the collection of Britain's foremost contemporary collector and patron, Charles Saatchi. Other Hirst works that will go on show at the exhibition, which opens on September 13 at the Saatchi Gallery, north London, include Horror at Home, an oversize ashtray filled with cigarette butts and detritus; The Last Supper, a series of screen prints of food; and Zeolite Mixture, one of his dot paintings. Earlier this year Mr Saatchi paid \u00a31m for Hirst's sculpture Hymn, a 20ft bronze model of an anatomical toy originally designed for children. Other artists exhibiting previously unseen work include many of the leading lights of the Young British Artists movement that Hirst so flamboyantly led. Tracey Emin exhibits photographs of herself in a 14ft weatherboard beach hut in Whitstable she bought with fellow artist Sarah Lucas in 1992. The beach hut itself, entitled The Last Thing I Said to You is Don't Leave Me Here, is also included in the exhibition, as is My Bed, the unmade bed that brought critical acclaim and opprobrium in equal measure when it was shortlisted for the Turner Prize.",

Wondering what it would be like if people's behaviour were determined by a system they couldn't control, Von Trier set up a video camera to film an ant colony in New Mexico. The image was transmitted live to a gallery in Copenhagen, where the ants' movements triggered sets of coloured lights in 19 rooms inhabited by 53 actors, watched over a month by a live audience. </p> <p>The actors came equipped only with background information on their characters, exotic oddballs with names like Phi, Emperor, AA, The Cur, Petite 1, Petite 2. They improvised their parts according to the changing lights - a system complicated by the fact that a given colour had an entirely different meaning for each actor. More detailed variables governed particular characters: Richard Bestboy changes personality seemingly at random; anyone touched by Starseed must freeze on the spot. </p> <p>This being a Danish production, and seemingly a dry run for Von Trier's psychodrama The Idiots, the stakes are higher than on Channel 4, offering sex, violence and madness. Otherwise the two productions are remarkably close. As the characters evolve in Psychomobile 1, the actors confess to being increasingly unable to separate the drama from their real emotions, which are often violent (\"There are light changes that changed lives,\" says one actor). </p> <p>Psychomobile 1 cannot, of course, have the real moral consequences of Big Brother, which increasingly resembles a machine for screwing up lives. But while the conventions of the gallery installation protect Psychomobile's audience from the real moral consequences of voyeurism, they don't - as far as you can tell from the film - cut out the rush of emotional danger that both actors and audience are exposed to. If anything, they heighten it. </p> <p>The idea of Psychomobile as a clock regulating the actors' movements makes you realise that Big Brother too is like a clock, and one designed to wind down. In the final weeks, Big Brother's drama will atrophy, its once-crowded stage will be almost deserted and the last few contestants will live out something increasingly resembling a Beckett play filmed according to Dogme rules. Von Trier's players were keen to achieve closure as the installation approached its ending. In the final week, the actors began to worry that the whole thing would end in a bloodbath, with characters killing each other to bring about a show-stopping finale.

      "body": "<p>A life jacket, like a divorce lawyer, is something you never want to use but, in the event of an emergency, you'd hope did exactly as it said on the tin. </p> <p>Yet, as <strong> Better By Design</strong> (C4) illustrated, in many ferry disasters, a divorce lawyer would probably be as much use as current life jackets. </p> <p>Helpfully, a life jacket comes with no instructions, so it's your best guess as to how it works that lies between you and a watery death. For many people, and no doubt many of the 852 souls who died on the Estonia ferry disaster in 1994, best guess wasn't good enough. </p> <p>But \"a life jacket should be so simple, people should automatically know how to put it on\", as Richard Seymour - evidently separated at birth from Clarissa Dickson Wright - noted, knowing that good design is the kind you don't notice. So he and his chum Dick Powell set about designing a new type of life jacket, more user-friendly and, hence, more life-saving. </p> <p>With the cooperation of a survivor of the Estonia disaster, design boffins and the sales director of Crewsaver, the company which makes the current kind of life jacket, the pair brainstormed, drew lovely sketches and got prototypes made. It was a real let's-put-on-a-show moment, the kind of montage you get in a film when, with all the odds against the heroes, they get down to some good old-fashioned hard work, turn the tide (as it were) and win the day. </p> <p>As the stick-in-the-mud of the piece, Andrew the sales director wasn't convinced that there was anything wrong with the present design. After all, in the maelstrom of salty recriminations that follow a ferry disaster, the usefulness (or not) of life jackets bobs to one side in favour of \"human error\" as a cause of death. </p> <p>Perhaps unfairly painted as the baddie of the piece, Andrew worried about issues of stowage, user-friendliness for both ferry companies and passengers and, naturally, cost. Thus, when the new design was tested, found to be better in every way, he had to concede he kinda liked it. Crewsaver's managing director liked it too, at least in front of the cameras. In the end though, after all the \"Hmmm, it's an interesting concept\" and \"It's worth taking forward\", Crewsaver decided the benefits did not justify the increased cost. Life is cheap. Hardly a happy ending with the triumphant heroes walking off into the sunset. (The paranoid amongst you might suggest there is a conspiracy to off ferry passengers going on, and you'd be half-right. There is a conspiracy but - and earnest lefty moment approaching - it's called capitalism, and we're all complicit). </p> <p>When Fran Leibowitz said \"Modern science is generally practiced by those who lack the flair for conversation\", Professor Susan Greenfield probably wasn't around. If the brains behind <strong> Brain Story</strong> (BBC2) had been, such a maxim would never have made it into the history books. Even when she describes the brain as 1.5 kilograms of matter with the consistency of soft butter, it sounds like poetry. So when she is actually talking about the indescribable, intangible enigma that is consciousness and the mystery of how it is, how it comes to be, how we are, her words are music. </p> <p>Not only that, she has so much fun with science.

      "bodyText": "A life jacket, like a divorce lawyer, is something you never want to use but, in the event of an emergency, you'd hope did exactly as it said on the tin. Yet, as Better By Design (C4) illustrated, in many ferry disasters, a divorce lawyer would probably be as much use as current life jackets. Helpfully, a life jacket comes with no instructions, so it's your best guess as to how it works that lies between you and a watery death. For many people, and no doubt many of the 852 souls who died on the Estonia ferry disaster in 1994, best guess wasn't good enough. But \"a life jacket should be so simple, people should automatically know how to put it on\", as Richard Seymour - evidently separated at birth from Clarissa Dickson Wright - noted, knowing that good design is the kind you don't notice. So he and his chum Dick Powell set about designing a new type of life jacket, more user-friendly and, hence, more life-saving. With the cooperation of a survivor of the Estonia disaster, design boffins and the sales director of Crewsaver, the company which makes the current kind of life jacket, the pair brainstormed, drew lovely sketches and got prototypes made. It was a real let's-put-on-a-show moment, the kind of montage you get in a film when, with all the odds against the heroes, they get down to some good old-fashioned hard work, turn the tide (as it were) and win the day. As the stick-in-the-mud of the piece, Andrew the sales director wasn't convinced that there was anything wrong with the present design. After all, in the maelstrom of salty recriminations that follow a ferry disaster, the usefulness (or not) of life jackets bobs to one side in favour of \"human error\" as a cause of death. Perhaps unfairly painted as the baddie of the piece, Andrew worried about issues of stowage, user-friendliness for both ferry companies and passengers and, naturally, cost. Thus, when the new design was tested, found to be better in every way, he had to concede he kinda liked it. Crewsaver's managing director liked it too, at least in front of the cameras. In the end though, after all the \"Hmmm, it's an interesting concept\" and \"It's worth taking forward\", Crewsaver decided the benefits did not justify the increased cost. Life is cheap. Hardly a happy ending with the triumphant heroes walking off into the sunset. (The paranoid amongst you might suggest there is a conspiracy to off ferry passengers going on, and you'd be half-right. There is a conspiracy but - and earnest lefty moment approaching - it's called capitalism, and we're all complicit). When Fran Leibowitz said \"Modern science is generally practiced by those who lack the flair for conversation\", Professor Susan Greenfield probably wasn't around. If the brains behind Brain Story (BBC2) had been, such a maxim would never have made it into the history books. Even when she describes the brain as 1.5 kilograms of matter with the consistency of soft butter, it sounds like poetry. So when she is actually talking about the indescribable, intangible enigma that is consciousness and the mystery of how it is, how it comes to be, how we are, her words are music. Not only that, she has so much fun with science. She goes out for coffee, she visits stately homes in glamorous silky dresses, she even goes to the Edinburgh festival to stand on a man lying face down on broken glass. (Will she come to mine for dinner, I wonder?) My adoration of Greenfield aside, Brain Story is rather marvellous, but the footage of brain surgery being performed on semi-conscious people was a bit icky for my liking.

Among its 400,000 people there is barely a family without ties to the fishing fleet, the merchant marine or the Russian navy.</p> <p>The city still displays the red stars, decorative anchors, and communist naval insignia that hark back to the glory days of the huge Soviet navy which projected the Kremlin's imperial power across the world's oceans.</p> <p>But its docks are crumbling, the fjords of the Kola peninsula are littered with dozens of discarded or inoperable submarines lying abandoned like beached whales. The young seamen of the northern fleet go hungry and unpaid.</p> <p>And in the wake of the Russian navy's worst peacetime disaster, the grim realisation has struck home as never before: the pipedreams of superpowerdom are gone, the admirals' arrogant delusions of geostrategic clout are risible, the Russian navy faces its biggest crisis of modern times.</p> <p>\"It's money, that's the big problem. Everything's destroyed,\" said Lilya, a local music teacher who spent the 1980s in Severomorsk, the northern fleet's home port outside Murmansk, with her navy officer husband.</p> <p>\"It was different in those days. Whatever Putin does now, there's no quick fix. The corruption, the thieving, the poverty: it will take a generation to sort things out.\"</p> <p>Since Peter the Great built it from scratch three hundred years ago, the Russian navy has gone through several cycles of destruction and reconstruction at colossal cost and with great human suffering: in the Crimean war in the 19th century, in the war with Japan at the beginning of the 20th, in the 1930s, and during and after the second world war.</p> <p>President Vladimir Putin now faces a comparable challenge. The Barents Sea tragedy has exposed the scale and depth of the naval crisis just when its commanders fostered the hope of supplanting the strategic missile forces as the key repository of the nuclear arsenal.</p> <p>The senior officer who died in the Kursk, the chief of staff of the fleet's seventh submarine division, was paid \u00a3130 a month. The 118 crew were virtual strangers to life at sea, the cost of fuelling and maintaining the submarines being so great that only three of the fleet's 42 nuclear submarines are on patrol at any one time.</p> <p>\"The situation on the Kursk was like that on all the other submarines,\" Roman Kolesnikov, father of a lieutenant-captain who died in the Kursk, told a Russian newspaper.</p> <p>\"The fleet's repairs base has collapsed. The repair workers don't get paid and go on strike. Then the boat's commanders do the repairs themselves. They sit there all day and night doing the repairs. The boats are leaking.</p> <p>\"No wonder, the boat's only been in the dry dock once in five years. One day it came in to dock and they refused to accept it for repairs.\"</p> <p>As the Kursk, the fifth Soviet or Russian submarine sunk in 20 years, lay at the bottom of the sea, one of the Russians' biggest humiliations was the sight of a dozen British and Norwegian divers promptly descending 108 metres to its stern and opening the escape hatch, if too late. \"The Norwegian divers accomplished in six hours what the Russian rescuers couldn't achieve in seven days,\" the Moscow newspaper Vremya MN commented.</p> <p>The northern navy spokesman, Vladimir Navrotsky, conceded that Russian divers could not go below 60 metres.</p> <p>Mr Putin may try to exploit this wretched state of affairs by embarking on a more radical reform of the military, puncturing the bloated ambitions of the admirals and generals and tailoring the armed forces to Russia's straitened circumstances.</p> <p>Heads are expected to roll. But Mr Putin has fed the ambitions of the top brass by repeatedly stressing how central the armed forces are to his promise to restore Russian greatness. The Kursk disaster has cruelly exposed the gap between his rhetoric and the reality experienced by Russia's conscripts and servicemen.</p> <p>The deep sheltered fjords of the Kola peninsula around Murmansk are the main home of Russia's rickety fleet, and the world's biggest graveyard for nuclear-powered ships and submarines.</p> <p>Two years ago the people of Murmansk were warned to take iodine pills during a nuclear fallout alert after a submarine fire. The authorities then claimed that the alarm was just an exercise.</p> <p>\"The whole Kola area is one big bomb,\" a Murmansk airport worker called Oleg said. \"People here are very sad and angry about the Kursk, but they've long been fed up with the situation.\"</p> <p>Against this background, the large billboards which appeared on the main roads of Moscow a couple of weeks ago look like a sick joke.</p> <p>\"A mighty navy for the glory of Russia,\" they proclaim, over a picture of a huge cruiser.</p> <p>They could not have been put there without the Kremlin's blessing, and they chime with Mr Putin's promise to restore Russia's military strength.</p>",

But its docks are crumbling, the fjords of the Kola peninsula are littered with dozens of discarded or inoperable submarines lying abandoned like beached whales. The young seamen of the northern fleet go hungry and unpaid. And in the wake of the Russian navy's worst peacetime disaster, the grim realisation has struck home as never before: the pipedreams of superpowerdom are gone, the admirals' arrogant delusions of geostrategic clout are risible, the Russian navy faces its biggest crisis of modern times. \"It's money, that's the big problem. Everything's destroyed,\" said Lilya, a local music teacher who spent the 1980s in Severomorsk, the northern fleet's home port outside Murmansk, with her navy officer husband. \"It was different in those days. Whatever Putin does now, there's no quick fix. The corruption, the thieving, the poverty: it will take a generation to sort things out.\" Since Peter the Great built it from scratch three hundred years ago, the Russian navy has gone through several cycles of destruction and reconstruction at colossal cost and with great human suffering: in the Crimean war in the 19th century, in the war with Japan at the beginning of the 20th, in the 1930s, and during and after the second world war. President Vladimir Putin now faces a comparable challenge. The Barents Sea tragedy has exposed the scale and depth of the naval crisis just when its commanders fostered the hope of supplanting the strategic missile forces as the key repository of the nuclear arsenal. The senior officer who died in the Kursk, the chief of staff of the fleet's seventh submarine division, was paid \u00a3130 a month. The 118 crew were virtual strangers to life at sea, the cost of fuelling and maintaining the submarines being so great that only three of the fleet's 42 nuclear submarines are on patrol at any one time. \"The situation on the Kursk was like that on all the other submarines,\" Roman Kolesnikov, father of a lieutenant-captain who died in the Kursk, told a Russian newspaper. \"The fleet's repairs base has collapsed. The repair workers don't get paid and go on strike. Then the boat's commanders do the repairs themselves. They sit there all day and night doing the repairs. The boats are leaking. \"No wonder, the boat's only been in the dry dock once in five years. One day it came in to dock and they refused to accept it for repairs.\" As the Kursk, the fifth Soviet or Russian submarine sunk in 20 years, lay at the bottom of the sea, one of the Russians' biggest humiliations was the sight of a dozen British and Norwegian divers promptly descending 108 metres to its stern and opening the escape hatch, if too late. \"The Norwegian divers accomplished in six hours what the Russian rescuers couldn't achieve in seven days,\" the Moscow newspaper Vremya MN commented. The northern navy spokesman, Vladimir Navrotsky, conceded that Russian divers could not go below 60 metres. Mr Putin may try to exploit this wretched state of affairs by embarking on a more radical reform of the military, puncturing the bloated ambitions of the admirals and generals and tailoring the armed forces to Russia's straitened circumstances. Heads are expected to roll. But Mr Putin has fed the ambitions of the top brass by repeatedly stressing how central the armed forces are to his promise to restore Russian greatness. The Kursk disaster has cruelly exposed the gap between his rhetoric and the reality experienced by Russia's conscripts and servicemen. The deep sheltered fjords of the Kola peninsula around Murmansk are the main home of Russia's rickety fleet, and the world's biggest graveyard for nuclear-powered ships and submarines. Two years ago the people of Murmansk were warned to take iodine pills during a nuclear fallout alert after a submarine fire. The authorities then claimed that the alarm was just an exercise. \"The whole Kola area is one big bomb,\" a Murmansk airport worker called Oleg said. \"People here are very sad and angry about the Kursk, but they've long been fed up with the situation.\" Against this background, the large billboards which appeared on the main roads of Moscow a couple of weeks ago look like a sick joke. \"A mighty navy for the glory of Russia,\" they proclaim, over a picture of a huge cruiser. They could not have been put there without the Kremlin's blessing, and they chime with Mr Putin's promise to restore Russia's military strength.",

      "bodyText": "The government's lucrative auctioning of airwaves yesterday focused on spectrum that will allow the delivery of high-speed internet access without a phone line. Prospective bidders were told a reserve of \u00a378.3m has been set for the auction of 33 licences, due to start on October 16. Analysts expect the sale to raise significantly more than the reserve after the auction of third-generation mobile phone licences raised \u00a322.5bn. British and international telecom operators are said to be interested in licences for the 28GHz spectrum, to deliver internet and multimedia access by wireless links. Operators will be able to bypass BT and the cable networks to provide such services to the small and medium-size businesses. Colt, Energis, Cable &amp; Wireless and MCI WorldCom are understood to be among those interested. Kim Howells, minister for competition and consumer af fairs, said: \"We have decided on an auction process as it provides a fast, transparent, fair and economically efficient way of allocating the scarce resource of radio spectrum. The levels bid will reflect the bidders' own valuations of the licences and the opportunities they see for broadband fixed wireless access.\" Atlantic Telecom has ruled itself out of the bidding for fear the auction process will inflate the price for licences. The company already owns national licences for fixed wireless operations, but these are run on a different frequency. Atlantic Telecom is viewed as a market leader in this area and built its strategy on attracting small to medium-size businesses with the promise of high-speed internet connection. Some analysts have estimated the auction of the licences could raise at least \u00a32bn for the Treasury's coffers. The government will auction three licences in the 28GHz band in 11 regions. Those licences will last for 15 years. A spectrum offering even higher speed broadband services at 40GHz, which would enable television and video conferencing on computers, may also be auctioned this year. Britain is behind Switzerland, Finland, Portugal, Spain, Ireland and Germany, which have already auctioned their licences for broadband wireless communications. Switzerland's auction of 13 licences is understood to have raised about \u00a3150m.",

A fine show, the Wheeltappers'. The late Colin Crompton is much missed. \"Given the priapic prankster's strange 1970s thatch and hilarious white suit,\" Martin continues, \"one assumes it is charm and wit that account for his remarkable strike rate [with women]. Handed a 50p piece by one of his stooges on Sunday night's show, Paul said: 'It's shaped like that so you can get it out of a Jew's hand with a spanner.' Priceless.\"</p> <p>Yes, priceless indeed.</p> <p>\u0095 The 50p piece is quite a motif with Paul, to judge by a letter from Klim Pye, who recalls an incident from April 1992 when he was busking outside Kings Cross. \"Paul Daniels happened by, along with a large lady minder. The millionaire held a 50p coin in front of my face until I stopped playing, I took it from him and put it in the hat.\" Klim considered his options for a moment, and did his duty. \"I skimmed the coin down the tunnel, just missing him as he turned down the stairs ... but I guess he heard the satisfying clinking behind him. I was playing Wooden Heart at the time. I wonder if he remembers?\"</p> <p>\u0095 Never in all the years I've been turning out this drivel has anything - not even the Oooh You Amaze Me T-shirts offer - provoked a post bag like the one concerning the Cumberland Pencil Museum in Keswick.</p> <p>Thanks for all the letters and emails, especially to Lionel Burman, who writes at length from Merseyside warning parents to prepare for long visits because children love it so much. He also mentions the now sadly extinct Museum of Contraceptive Technique, while someone called WJSK emails to praise the French. \"Not even Devon's best,\" he posits, \"can compare with Agen's superb Prune Museum.\"</p> <p>\u0095 Hype about a snap October election is baffling. Mr Tony Blair may not be the brightest, bless him, but is he likely to risk an election almost immediately after three weeks of the Olympics? Assuming our athletes perform as usual, the papers and phone-ins will be doing the requisite \"What's wrong with Britain?\" self-pitying whine. So I think you can rule out October. And remember, this is the column that brought you the \"Gordon and Sarah ... it's over for ever\" exclusive, so you can trust us.</p> <p>\u0095 Is there no limit to the versatility of Valerie Leon? Already familiar to readers as a uniquely fearsome PR, not to mention the shop girl who erected Charles Hawtrey's tent in Carry On Camping, Valerie appears now to have appointed herself co-diarist. \"Does this inspire you?\" begins her latest fax. \"Titillating Tania the Lotus Eater (alias Valerie Leon) was first seen wielding her whip by private arrangement with Cato in Return of the Pink Panther. They are to revive their dubious partnership for the Hungarian Cultural Centre, who are celebrating the extraordinary life of national poet Janos Pilinszky at the Hampstead Theatre on Sunday August 27. Valerie (add your usual Carry On Camping blurb) has promised me a private session with her whip if I mention the event.\" Excellent. Welcome aboard, Val.</p> <p>\u0095 There is no news today of kidnap victim Gerald Kaufman. However, negotiations with splinter terrorist group the Real GAF (Judy Garland Appreciation Front) reopened late on Monday night, and we are quietly hoping for an announcement tomorrow.</p>",

I was playing Wooden Heart at the time. I wonder if he remembers?\" \u0095 Never in all the years I've been turning out this drivel has anything - not even the Oooh You Amaze Me T-shirts offer - provoked a post bag like the one concerning the Cumberland Pencil Museum in Keswick. Thanks for all the letters and emails, especially to Lionel Burman, who writes at length from Merseyside warning parents to prepare for long visits because children love it so much. He also mentions the now sadly extinct Museum of Contraceptive Technique, while someone called WJSK emails to praise the French. \"Not even Devon's best,\" he posits, \"can compare with Agen's superb Prune Museum.\" \u0095 Hype about a snap October election is baffling. Mr Tony Blair may not be the brightest, bless him, but is he likely to risk an election almost immediately after three weeks of the Olympics? Assuming our athletes perform as usual, the papers and phone-ins will be doing the requisite \"What's wrong with Britain?\" self-pitying whine. So I think you can rule out October. And remember, this is the column that brought you the \"Gordon and Sarah ... it's over for ever\" exclusive, so you can trust us. \u0095 Is there no limit to the versatility of Valerie Leon? Already familiar to readers as a uniquely fearsome PR, not to mention the shop girl who erected Charles Hawtrey's tent in Carry On Camping, Valerie appears now to have appointed herself co-diarist. \"Does this inspire you?\" begins her latest fax. \"Titillating Tania the Lotus Eater (alias Valerie Leon) was first seen wielding her whip by private arrangement with Cato in Return of the Pink Panther. They are to revive their dubious partnership for the Hungarian Cultural Centre, who are celebrating the extraordinary life of national poet Janos Pilinszky at the Hampstead Theatre on Sunday August 27. Valerie (add your usual Carry On Camping blurb) has promised me a private session with her whip if I mention the event.\" Excellent. Welcome aboard, Val. \u0095 There is no news today of kidnap victim Gerald Kaufman. However, negotiations with splinter terrorist group the Real GAF (Judy Garland Appreciation Front) reopened late on Monday night, and we are quietly hoping for an announcement tomorrow.",

The rise follows last year's increase of 20% - and is set to continue, with the average cost of insuring a car rising from \u00a3226 in 1999 to \u00a3283 this year and \u00a3353 in 2001.

      "body": "<p>It was the greatest British superfest of all time. The biggest acts, the biggest crowd and the biggest debacle. I was 16, and with 600,000 other fans crossed to the Isle of Wight to be with Jimi Hendrix, the Doors, the Who, and a Who's Who of 1970s rock stars. Fans had been there all week and had set up a large area of troll shanties. Bare-chested Vikings with flares and harmonicas watched lethargically as thousands of newcomers passed through their settlement. Most were heading for the hill. </p> <p>The organisers had thoughtfully constructed a secure arena that was overlooked by a hill that provided exceptional sound reception and an unparalleled view of the stage. They must have assumed that no one would want to spend three days on a slope as no attempt was made to prevent fans from taking up their free grandstand seats. Much of the hill was already occupied when we arrived. Only the steeper sections were vacant, but we found that by sitting in the scrubby bushes we could prevent ourselves from sliding down. As the summer light began to fade and the first acts started performing, the breeze rolled the clouds from 100,000 joints up the hillside. </p> <p>Later that night, realising their error, the organisers made a three- pronged attack on the hill. First they tried turning the volume down. This provoked loud protests from everyone in the arena who was more than 50 yards from the stage. Second, a searchlight was turned on to discomfort those on the hill by not allowing them to sleep. This provided us with welcome light to peel oranges, open packets of biscuits and pee without saturating someone's sleeping bag. It also let latecomers know that they could still get a free seat in the gods, stage right. Finally, an agitated man came to the mike and begged us to decamp immediately or the festival would be cancelled. Heavy. </p> <p>There was always a presumption that if enough people turned up, like Woodstock in the US the year before, it would become a free festival. We woke on Saturday to the sight of 20 or so Hell's Angels wielding spanners and long bar socket sets and heading purposefully in our direction. As we cowered in our bush they suddenly veered off towards the arena fence. Within a minute, operating quicker than Kwik Fit fitters, they had removed a 10-metre section of perimeter fencing. With whoops of triumph the hordes from the hill poured through the gap and spilled into the arena. The organisers' announcement - \"We have decided to open the gates. This is now a free festival\" - was met with roars of approval from everyone, apart from those who had paid for their tickets and were now being jostled for space by crowds of freeloaders. </p> <p>It didn't take us long to realise that we had unwittingly swapped the royal box for Bedlam. Bodies lay everywhere on the urine-soaked ground of the arena. Bad-trippers flailed at the air and screeched at devils. Some rocked and hugged themselves, other wept with their eyes screwed tight against the frenzy. The volume of noise from the louder bands rushed through bodies like clumsy ultrasound. Joni Mitchell left the stage in tears and several acts disappointed hugely. We saw hippies come to blows. We left for the safety of our eyrie. </p> <p>Appeals to raise money for drug busts were broadcast frantically amid longer and longer periods of silence from the stage. Rumours were rife that the organisers now could not afford the acts they had booked, and music was increasingly confined to records. Desperate times called for a desperate act. It still comes as a terrible shock to me to realise that I had travelled the length of the country to see, among others, Tiny Tim. It comes as an even bigger shock to remember that, with every other member of the crowd, we gave him an enormous welcome and demanded encores. He was not good - he was never good - but cometh the hour, came the falsetto. </p> <p> Sunday morning brought more problems. The PA system spluttered and stuttered. Appeals for cash became increasingly hysterical. Announcements became more bizarre: \"Could the person who left the hand-grenade in the shelter tent please come and collect it...\" \"Could somebody please claim the girl with tattooed tits in the first aid tent. She has forgotten who she is.\" More feedback squeals, whirrs, pops and silence. Early morning golfers were horrified to find tents pitched on the green at the back of the hill, but still putted out among the debris. </p> <p>The crowd took to providing its own entertainment. I have an abiding image of a man playing pleasant acoustic guitar on a doorless toilet while the cubicle next to him burned furiously. The biggest cheer of the day came for a record, and we sang along ponderously: \"Layzee Sunday Afternoonah...\" </p> <p>The pervading weltschmerz was further deepened by the growing rumours that Hendrix had cried off. Some had already started on the trek to the ferries. If you wanted proof that this was not the 60s, it was all around. The daring and freshness of Woodstock had here become humourless and tired. The chaos had started to matter. We were going through the motions. Lots of doubts, little direction, waiting and taking stock after an incandescent decade. </p> <p>Three days and two nights had taken its toll on the crowd and many now slept. Unannounced, Hendrix started to play in the early hours of Monday morning. I slept through his opening number and then found myself sitting in the dark with half a million people, just listening. Strangely, you could sense the crowd's restraint. It was as if by shouting or applauding we would miss something or alter the focus. We looked down at the brightness of the stage and the first haunting bars of All Along the Watchtower spiralled back to us. Three weeks later Hendrix was dead and all we had were the LPs and the memories from the hill. </p> <p>Someone mentioned the Isle of Wight festival at the pub the other night. No one had actually been, but they all spoke of it with affection and how it was the great musical event of all time. It is perhaps not peculiar that people who were not there know more about it than those who were. The longing may well outweigh the experience. In the minds of men and women, time has certainly done the Isle of Wight festival 1970 a favour. But I bet there are 600,000 of us who still wouldn't have changed it, or missed it for the world.</p>",

      "body": "<p>So to the land of the real north-south divide, where the border is real rather than metaphorical and what's at stake are not house prices but life and death. For in Ireland the killing has returned - though now it wears a different face. It is no longer a struggle between two sides fighting to erase or preserve that border between north and south. The new Troubles are troubles within - loyalists killing loyalists.</p> <p>One gang attacked the other's parade on Saturday and the familiar revenge tragedy began in earnest: tit for tat, this life for that one, your eye for mine. The combatants are loyalist factions whose names form an alphabet soup of fratricidal rivalry: the UDA and UFF, backed by the UDP, on one side; and the UVF, backed by the PUP, on the other. It could be an Ulster production of Monty Python's Life of Brian - with the People's Front of Judea at daggers' drawn with the Judean People's Front. It could be, except two men were left dead on Monday, and four others have been killed in loyalist feuding these last few months - so no one is laughing.</p> <p>What should those who wish only peace for Northern Ireland - and who had half thought we'd got there - think now? Is this a threat to the peace process or is it internal housekeeping, the equivalent of a mafia war where hoods rub out hoods but \"civilians\" are in no danger?</p> <p>The quick and reassuring answer is that the latest round of violence is an internal matter. It represents a battle for supremacy in the Shankill estate, with the Ulster Freedom Fighters' Johnny \"Mad Dog\" Adair, only recently released from the Maze prison, bidding for turf and power: Mad Dog wants to be top dog. Those on the ground are in little doubt that he is fomenting the current trouble: he wants to be the lord of the Shankill.</p> <p>There is something reassuring about this view. The men may be brutal, their terrain may be benighted, but it seems safely distant from the peace process. After all, and in true Monty Python style, no one can name a doctrinal difference that separates Adair's UFF from the Ulster Volunteer Force which it hates so bloodily. It is not as if they are fighting over the details of the Good Friday agreement. On the contrary, the political wings of both paramilitary organisations were committed to the agreement earlier and with more enthusiasm than David Trimble's officially more moderate Ulster Unionist party.</p> <p>Still, though it may be comforting to see the current bloodletting as a Belfast episode of the Sopranos, it might also be a mistake. For there is danger here for Northern Ireland's fragile peace.</p> <p>For one thing, even though Adair may look like a gangland thug he is not without politics. Under his watch, the UFF and its allies in the Ulster Defence Association have cosied up to the ultra-hardline Loyalist Volunteer Force. Unlike the other organisations, the LVF was never a serious partner in the peace process: it is a rejectionist outfit whose creed was horrific violence. If Adair is taking a movement that was once inside the peace tent and moving it outside, then that is a cause for real alarm.</p> <p>The current violence could derail the peace process in a more direct way. \"The traditional way these things end is by killing some taigs,\" says one watchful republican. He worries that loyalist internecine feuding rarely stays internecine for long: eventually they murder Catholics, if only to assert their status as the chief defenders of their community. Belfast's Catholics will be locking their doors more tightly tonight.</p> <p>But there is a deeper challenge the men of loyalist violence pose to the accord. For what they have exposed are the places where the politicians failed.</p> <p>Start with the opponents of Good Friday. What the last few days prove is that Unionism's hardliners, along with their allies on the British right, were looking in the wrong direction all along. Throughout the 1990s they were obsessed with the IRA; they rarely made a squeak about the armed men of loyalism.</p> <p>They ignored the fact that the most vicious crimes of the Troubles were often committed by men pledging allegiance to the Union flag: witness the 1970s killing spree of the Shankill Butchers. British security sources privately admit that, while they faced in the IRA a disciplined organisation all but run like an army, they often confronted in loyalism men who seemed driven less by politics than psychopathy (or the racketeering pursuit of personal profit).</p> <p>The rejectionists may also have been looking the wrong way when they chose their ground for opposition. The deal-breaker for them was always decommissioning - usually of republican weapons.

      "bodyText": "So to the land of the real north-south divide, where the border is real rather than metaphorical and what's at stake are not house prices but life and death. For in Ireland the killing has returned - though now it wears a different face. It is no longer a struggle between two sides fighting to erase or preserve that border between north and south. The new Troubles are troubles within - loyalists killing loyalists. One gang attacked the other's parade on Saturday and the familiar revenge tragedy began in earnest: tit for tat, this life for that one, your eye for mine. The combatants are loyalist factions whose names form an alphabet soup of fratricidal rivalry: the UDA and UFF, backed by the UDP, on one side; and the UVF, backed by the PUP, on the other. It could be an Ulster production of Monty Python's Life of Brian - with the People's Front of Judea at daggers' drawn with the Judean People's Front. It could be, except two men were left dead on Monday, and four others have been killed in loyalist feuding these last few months - so no one is laughing. What should those who wish only peace for Northern Ireland - and who had half thought we'd got there - think now? Is this a threat to the peace process or is it internal housekeeping, the equivalent of a mafia war where hoods rub out hoods but \"civilians\" are in no danger? The quick and reassuring answer is that the latest round of violence is an internal matter. It represents a battle for supremacy in the Shankill estate, with the Ulster Freedom Fighters' Johnny \"Mad Dog\" Adair, only recently released from the Maze prison, bidding for turf and power: Mad Dog wants to be top dog. Those on the ground are in little doubt that he is fomenting the current trouble: he wants to be the lord of the Shankill. There is something reassuring about this view. The men may be brutal, their terrain may be benighted, but it seems safely distant from the peace process. After all, and in true Monty Python style, no one can name a doctrinal difference that separates Adair's UFF from the Ulster Volunteer Force which it hates so bloodily. It is not as if they are fighting over the details of the Good Friday agreement. On the contrary, the political wings of both paramilitary organisations were committed to the agreement earlier and with more enthusiasm than David Trimble's officially more moderate Ulster Unionist party. Still, though it may be comforting to see the current bloodletting as a Belfast episode of the Sopranos, it might also be a mistake. For there is danger here for Northern Ireland's fragile peace. For one thing, even though Adair may look like a gangland thug he is not without politics. Under his watch, the UFF and its allies in the Ulster Defence Association have cosied up to the ultra-hardline Loyalist Volunteer Force. Unlike the other organisations, the LVF was never a serious partner in the peace process: it is a rejectionist outfit whose creed was horrific violence. If Adair is taking a movement that was once inside the peace tent and moving it outside, then that is a cause for real alarm. The current violence could derail the peace process in a more direct way. \"The traditional way these things end is by killing some taigs,\" says one watchful republican. He worries that loyalist internecine feuding rarely stays internecine for long: eventually they murder Catholics, if only to assert their status as the chief defenders of their community. Belfast's Catholics will be locking their doors more tightly tonight. But there is a deeper challenge the men of loyalist violence pose to the accord. For what they have exposed are the places where the politicians failed. Start with the opponents of Good Friday. What the last few days prove is that Unionism's hardliners, along with their allies on the British right, were looking in the wrong direction all along. Throughout the 1990s they were obsessed with the IRA; they rarely made a squeak about the armed men of loyalism. They ignored the fact that the most vicious crimes of the Troubles were often committed by men pledging allegiance to the Union flag: witness the 1970s killing spree of the Shankill Butchers. British security sources privately admit that, while they faced in the IRA a disciplined organisation all but run like an army, they often confronted in loyalism men who seemed driven less by politics than psychopathy (or the racketeering pursuit of personal profit). The rejectionists may also have been looking the wrong way when they chose their ground for opposition. The deal-breaker for them was always decommissioning - usually of republican weapons. John Hume kept on saying that disarmament was a red herring: you could give up guns on Monday only to buy new ones on Tuesday. Others quietly warned that the bitterest pill would be the release of prisoners - not just republican killers like those behind the 1984 Brighton bomb, but also the likes of Mad Dog Adair.

But the size of the buildings suggests that uranium enrichment at Dimona is carried out on a relatively small scale. </p> <p>The pictures show that dozens of small buildings have been added to the 14 square mile site in the Negev desert over the last 30 years. There are two extra medium-sized buildings measuring 26,500 and 30,100 sq ft, and a large building of 84,000 sq ft has been expanded to 103,700 sq ft (9,569 square metres). </p> <p>The FAS, a Washington-based organisation which lobbies on scientific issues and includes 51 Nobel laureates among its sponsors, says there are several \"interesting terrain features\" at Dimona whose purpose has not been identified. </p> <p>Pictures taken in the 1960s revealed a large excavation area, from which the Israelis removed an estimated 66,000 to 81,000 cubic yards of earth.

      "bodyText": "New photographs of the secret Israeli reactor at Dimona, published on the internet, confirm that Israel could have made 100-200 nuclear weapons, according to the Federation of American Scientists. The high-resolution pictures, taken last month by Space Imaging Corporation's Ikonos satellite, are likely to settle arguments about how much plutonium the reactor can produce - from which the size of Israel's weapons stockpile can be calculated. \"Based on plausible upper and lower bounds of the operating practices at the reactor, Israel could have produced enough plutonium for at least 100 nuclear weapons, but probably not significantly more than 200 weapons,\" says the FAS. It says the pictures support claims that Israel could be using highly enriched uranium to build nuclear weapons, or to increase the yield of plutonium weapons. Buildings can be seen which may be associated with two techniques for uranium production: gas centrifuge and laser separation. But the size of the buildings suggests that uranium enrichment at Dimona is carried out on a relatively small scale. The pictures show that dozens of small buildings have been added to the 14 square mile site in the Negev desert over the last 30 years. There are two extra medium-sized buildings measuring 26,500 and 30,100 sq ft, and a large building of 84,000 sq ft has been expanded to 103,700 sq ft (9,569 square metres). The FAS, a Washington-based organisation which lobbies on scientific issues and includes 51 Nobel laureates among its sponsors, says there are several \"interesting terrain features\" at Dimona whose purpose has not been identified. Pictures taken in the 1960s revealed a large excavation area, from which the Israelis removed an estimated 66,000 to 81,000 cubic yards of earth. The latest pictures show efforts to landscape the same area. The FAS suggests this may conceal a large underground reprocessing facility. Just over half a mile from the main site, the pictures show what is believed to be a burial area for low-level radioactive waste. Israel, the only nuclear power which does not admit to possessing nuclear weapons, has always refused to allow international inspection of the site. In 1986, Mordechai Vanunu, who was a technician at Dimona, was abducted by Mossad agents in London and sentenced to 18 years in prison for providing information about Dimona, including pictures, to the Sunday Times. The latest pictures have been shown on Israeli television and published in a newspaper, under a rule allowing material available on the internet to escape the military censor, as long as the source is mentioned. Israel is one of a handful of countries which have refused to sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. Israel was singled out at the NPT review conference in New York in May for not placing its nuclear materials under \"comprehensive\" international safeguards. Israel's nuclear weapons programme was debated for the first time in the Knesset, the country's parliament, in February this year. Israel was said to have stockpiled up to 300 bombs, developed with the help of the South African apartheid regime, and it was planning to adapt submarines recently bought from Germany to carry nuclear missiles. Though Shimon Peres, the father of the country's nuclear programme, has admitted that Dimona was built as a deterrent, Israel maintains an official policy of ambiguity, saying only that it will not be the first to \"introduce\" nuclear weapons in the Middle East.

Background Productions has filed suit against Love and the producers of Beat, which stars Kiefer Sutherland as heavily narcoticised author William Burroughs, and Love as his second wife Joan Vollmer, who he accidentally killed.

Mr Marshall Mathers filed for divorce last week from the woman he's been with since high school - to call them sweethearts might be pushing it, as he's written several songs about murdering her and has Kim Rot In Pieces tattooed on his chest. Their turbulent relationship has included him pulling a gun on a man he thought she was involved with, and a suicide attempt... </p> <p>More bad boy rappers - this time in the form of the <strong> Wu Tang Clan</strong> 's Ghostface Killah and U-God. Journalist Edward Cash Wallace has called in the police, claiming that he went backstage at a San Francisco concert under the impression that he was to conduct an interview, but instead was beaten by a Wu Tang bodyguard and then by the rappers themselves. Show promoter Boots Houghston admits that Wallace was punched by the bodyguard, but claims it was because no interview had been agreed and he was harassing the band.

Alexandra Cardenas, a Production Supervisor, alleges that Love called her a \"puta\" (a whore) in front of the whole cast and crew, and Antonio Zavalas, the CEO of Background, says that she called him and his employees \"corrupt Mexicans\"... And, after a (very) short break from the law courts, Eminem 's back. This time though, he's bringing the case, as his on-again, off-again relationship with wife Kimberley comes to a pretty decisive off. Mr Marshall Mathers filed for divorce last week from the woman he's been with since high school - to call them sweethearts might be pushing it, as he's written several songs about murdering her and has Kim Rot In Pieces tattooed on his chest. Their turbulent relationship has included him pulling a gun on a man he thought she was involved with, and a suicide attempt... More bad boy rappers - this time in the form of the Wu Tang Clan 's Ghostface Killah and U-God. Journalist Edward Cash Wallace has called in the police, claiming that he went backstage at a San Francisco concert under the impression that he was to conduct an interview, but instead was beaten by a Wu Tang bodyguard and then by the rappers themselves. Show promoter Boots Houghston admits that Wallace was punched by the bodyguard, but claims it was because no interview had been agreed and he was harassing the band. Rappers and journalists - not a good combination.",

      "bodyText": "An EU ban on the export of live pigs and pig semen from England will be eased this week, days after it was imposed, providing a welcome boost for the hard-pressed pork and bacon industry. European vets yesterday unanimously agreed that the restrictions should only apply to animals from Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex, where 12,000 pigs on five farms have been slaughtered following an outbreak of classical swine fever. The lifting of the ban on pigs from most of England must be agreed by commissioners on Friday but the government was relieved at the speed at with which the trade boycott, imposed on Monday last week, was being eased. The decision by the vets amounted to a vote of confidence in measures to contain the disease, even though about 100 other farms are still under movement controls because of their proximity to the infected farms. Seven other farms around the country have been cleared of swine fever although tests are still being completed on others that have reported sick pigs. None of the pigs on these farms has yet been found to be suffering from the disease. The EU vets may consider easing the ban further early next month. Nick Brown, the agriculture minister, said the EU response was \"proportionate to the current risks\". It demonstrated that his department \"was right to take the precautionary approach which was essential to stop the disease in its tracks and confirm the benefits of the contructive approach we have adopted towards our partners in the European Union.\" Jim Scudamore, the government's chief veterinary officer, said officials were trying to reduce the size of the surveillance zones. \"We have been tracing the movements of pigs, people and vehicles from the infected farms and we have been visit ing the destinations and looking at the pigs there and testing blood samples. We have got results coming in all the time and if they are all negative, then we will have contained it in East Anglia.\" John Godfrey, chairman of the National Pig Association, was delighted by the decision and said that British vets had done a \"tremendous job\" in fighting the outbreak. \"But we have much work still to do to alleviate the pressures on those farms in the 10 km surveillance zones,\" he said. Association leaders will meet Mr Brown today to discuss compensation and further help. The Pig Veterinary Society said thousands of pigs on farms surrounding the infected ones should be slaughtered and compensation paid to their owners to stop massive overcrowding problems caused by the movement restrictions. \"The implication for the welfare of these animals is horrifying. The financial implications for these innocent farmers are equally distressing, particularly coming on the back of two years of huge financial loss. The potential is there for large areas of East Anglian farming to disappear.\" Tim Yeo, the Conservative agriculture spokesman, and Colin Breed, for the Liberal Democrats, echoed the call for swift action to prevent the build-up of live pigs. Live pig exports are thought to be worth around \u00a330m a year, a relatively small proportion of the \u00a3126m a year export trade but there had been fears in some quarters that a wider ban on exporting pork and bacon might be considered.

Nor is the mini-series promising us the shocking truth about what really happened. But the portentously titled American Tragedy is a surprisingly heavyweight affair, with a script by Norman Mailer, and the Homicide/Oz pairing of Tom Fontana and Barry Levinson as executive-producers. Ving Rhames has been signed up to play showboating attorney Johnny Cochrane. All in all, it looks as upmarket as mainstream US TV gets. </p> <p>But OJ doesn't want to be reminded of the trial. He seems to have been keeping a relatively low profile recently, since those misguided attempts to relaunch himself on the chat-show circuit. And his lawyers think that they have found a way to stop the mini-series reviving his trauma. They have filed a complaint with the Los Angeles Superior Court, claiming that the programme will be using privileged information provided by a member of the Simpson defence team, Robert Kardashian - a breach of confidentiality. There is, however, a big flaw with this. The mini-series is based on writer/director Lawrence Schiller's book American Tragedy: The Uncensored Story Of The Simpson Defence. And the book - which contains all the information supplied by Kardashian - was published in 1997. If Simpson was going to sue, he should have done it back then. He claims that he was too busy with the civil suit - which he lost - brought by the victims' families accusing him of being responsible for the deaths of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman. </p> <p>But \"too busy\" isn't a generally accepted legal excuse. With Kardashian's leaks in the public domain for three years, it is unlikely that a court will do anything now. Not unless they buy into the subtext to the suit: that it is fine for information to appear in print because most people don't read, but put in a high-profile TV show and it can be really damaging. </p> <p>So can you stop a TV or film company hijacking your life? In Europe, you might have a chance. In the US, probably not. In 1998 a California Supreme Court ruling (Polydoros v Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp) established that the right to privacy cannot be used by an individual to stop their name, history and personality from being used in a work of fiction. For the famous - like OJ - there is another law, the right of publicity, which might help. </p> <p>It holds that you can't make money from a celebrity's image without their permission. But while its application for ads and T-shirts is clear, no one is quite sure if it covers TV or film. In general, programme and film-makers avoid trouble by either asking permission or cobbling together composite characters. But for some reason, nobody seemed that worried about offending Mr Simpson. </p> <p>The same week that OJ was launching his case, another American male associated with a controversial death was having a little more luck with the TV networks. Aides for Senator Edward Kennedy gently suggested to the NBC network that running their Kennedy wives mini-series Jackie, Ethel, Joan: The Women Of Camelot two days before the November election, might be an interference with the democratic process. NBC considered the request, and decided that indeed it might be better not to remind Massachusetts voters about Chappaquiddick on the way to the polls. They have postponed the series to a less topical (and less troublesome) time in February. OJ, no doubt, will be reflecting on how, despite four decades of fruitful muckraking, nothing beats the Kennedy name.</p>",

      "bodyText": "I can't imagine why John Gray (Russia's fall, August 22) thinks the west should shoulder the blame for the state of Russia. Western advisers may have recommended privatisation and freeing up prices. They also suggested eliminating corruption and the introduction of property rights and tax laws. Russia chose the parts that would create the oligarchs and impoverish the majority, while ignoring what might help the development of a market economy and a democratic society. I spent several years trying to help Russian managers run their businesses. Pointing out their problems - inefficiently producing low-quality goods that no one wants - got a few polite nods, followed by a list of reasons why the suggested changes wouldn't work for them. From the company to the macro level, the Russian response has been the same. Gray's comments about policies \"utterly unsuited to history and circumstance\" just echoes the Russian authorities' own excuses. Russia will change when those in power drop their bone-headed obstinacy and accept the responsibility for the terrible state of the country.

His approach was always subtly different from the mainstream. Steeped in the tradition of Joseph Rowntree, he never looked at issues from the top down. Despite his intellectual prowess and establishment appearance - he was always immaculately turned out - he had no sense of superiority; he was determined that the places built by the Joseph Rowntree Housing Trust should not bear the stamp of charity, rather being, as Rowntree said, \"self governing communities\".</p> <p>Waddilove championed the idea of housing co-operatives and was critical of local authority housing, where he felt tenants were powerless.

      "body": "<p>There have been very few leaders of British industry who could claim, with some irony, that they both pioneered a revolution in the banking system and helped to bring down a Conservative government. But that was the remarkable achievement of Sir Campbell Adamson, who has died aged 78.</p> <p>As director-general of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), he was accused of helping to undermine the Heath government during the general election of February 1974. While he rejected the charge out of hand, the story remains full of fascination.</p> <p>Adamson was appointed to his high-profile job in 1969, at a peak of industrial tension between government, employers and trade unions; a year later, Edward Heath's Conservative party swept to power on a platform of reform. The Industrial Relations Act was introduced at the end of 1970 and, at once, ran into huge problems, from which the government was forced to retreat in the face of trade union power. By mid-1972, compromise was in the air, and, throughout 1973, Heath, the CBI and the TUC sought to establish a working relationship.</p> <p>The breakdown of this attempt - caused by the Middle East crisis, oil prices quadrupling overnight and a miners' strike - precipitated the February 1974 election.</p> <p>Two days before polling day, Adamson, in a private speech to the Industrial Society, criticised the rigidity of the government's industrial relations policy. The press had not been invited, but somehow his words slipped out. They caused a political sensation and, after Heath lost the election, he blamed Adamson for contributing to the government's narrow defeat.</p> <p>It was an absurd exaggeration because Adamson had said nothing that was not common knowledge through- out industry - nor, for that matter, inside the Heath government. Even so, Adamson felt duty bound to fall on his sword; he twice tendered his resignation, which was twice rejected. He then took all the flak with great stoicism, nor was there any trace of whinge. Yet the shadow of that occasion always remained at the back of his mind.</p> <p>His other prime slot in history must be his remarkable achievement in pioneering the change in status of the Abbey National Building Society from a mutual to a public company - the first major building society to move in that direction. It was the opening shot in a revolution that transformed Britain's financial services and, to achieve it, Adamson had to overcome tradition, prejudice and fierce opposition from Abbey members.

      "bodyText": "There have been very few leaders of British industry who could claim, with some irony, that they both pioneered a revolution in the banking system and helped to bring down a Conservative government. But that was the remarkable achievement of Sir Campbell Adamson, who has died aged 78. As director-general of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), he was accused of helping to undermine the Heath government during the general election of February 1974. While he rejected the charge out of hand, the story remains full of fascination. Adamson was appointed to his high-profile job in 1969, at a peak of industrial tension between government, employers and trade unions; a year later, Edward Heath's Conservative party swept to power on a platform of reform. The Industrial Relations Act was introduced at the end of 1970 and, at once, ran into huge problems, from which the government was forced to retreat in the face of trade union power. By mid-1972, compromise was in the air, and, throughout 1973, Heath, the CBI and the TUC sought to establish a working relationship. The breakdown of this attempt - caused by the Middle East crisis, oil prices quadrupling overnight and a miners' strike - precipitated the February 1974 election. Two days before polling day, Adamson, in a private speech to the Industrial Society, criticised the rigidity of the government's industrial relations policy. The press had not been invited, but somehow his words slipped out. They caused a political sensation and, after Heath lost the election, he blamed Adamson for contributing to the government's narrow defeat. It was an absurd exaggeration because Adamson had said nothing that was not common knowledge through- out industry - nor, for that matter, inside the Heath government. Even so, Adamson felt duty bound to fall on his sword; he twice tendered his resignation, which was twice rejected. He then took all the flak with great stoicism, nor was there any trace of whinge. Yet the shadow of that occasion always remained at the back of his mind. His other prime slot in history must be his remarkable achievement in pioneering the change in status of the Abbey National Building Society from a mutual to a public company - the first major building society to move in that direction. It was the opening shot in a revolution that transformed Britain's financial services and, to achieve it, Adamson had to overcome tradition, prejudice and fierce opposition from Abbey members. In the end, however, his scheme triumphed by a vote of 9 to 1. Adamson was born in Perth, the only son of a distinguished Scottish accountant, who disliked even the idea of living south of the border - \"true Scots\", as Adamson would describe his family culture, with a touch of characteristic humour. Nonetheless, an attractive job offer persuaded the father to move to England, and send his son to Rugby. Young Adamson went on to Corpus Christi, Cambridge, where he read economics under John Maynard Keynes - an influence which never left him. A hereditary night-blindness kept Adamson out of the war, although he tried everything to get into the armed services. After a brief war-time stint with the Royal Institute of International Affairs, he went into the steel industry. He started in 1945 as a management trainee with Baldwins, in south Wales, and went on to work with the merged Richard Thomas &amp; Baldwin plants, ending up - at the age of 36 - in charge of the construction and operations division of RTB's huge Spencer works at Llanwern. All of that was re-shaped into the Steel Company of Wales (Scow) prior to nationalisation in 1947, at which point Adamson took charge of labour relations. It was his achievements in steel - in particular, the humanity of his management - that drew him to the attention of Harold Wilson's second Labour government, and, in 1967, he was invited to join the still-developing Department of Economic Affairs (DEA), George Brown's ill-fated invention designed to challenge Treasury economic dominance of Whitehall. Adamson was appointed as a senior industrial adviser, in charge of co-ordinating all the other industrial advisers. He was given the temporary status of a deputy under- secretary of state, although, by the time he arrived at the DEA, Brown had moved on and Michael Stewart was in charge of a department that was plainly heading nowhere in particular. After two years, Adamson was glad to leave. Technically, he was still attached to Scow, but, by then, the steel industry had been re-nationalised, and the first chairman of British Steel, Lord Melchett, wanted to appoint him to a senior managerial post. That is when fate and chance intervened. Adamson wanted a holiday between leaving Whitehall and taking up a new job.

No one who walked with him was ever in any doubt about his unusual mix of qualities - immense sensitivity, a strong, ethically-based vision, and mischievous humour coupled with self-deprecation.

She was not a trained singer, but Feroz, and the London-based composer Biddu, liked the nasal quality of her voice. Nazia's association with Biddu brought her into the limelight on the British Asian pop scene. Together, they brought out the immensely successful album, Disco Deewane (1981), which, with its racy songs and harmonious blend of eastern rhythms and western beats, was number one for more than a year. Overnight, Nazia became the queen of Asian pop. Later, she and her brother, Zohaib Hassan, sang in another Bollywood film, Star. They returned to Pakistan in the early 1980s and released their first album, Young Tarang. Another album, Hotline, followed in 1987. Nazia's last solo album, Camera Camera, came out in London in 1992. Though some of these later albums lacked Nazia's early expressiveness, they still revealed her joie de vivre. Nazia, who had a London University law degree, lived most of her life in Britain, but always returned to her roots in Pakistan. She was independent, and was never afraid to speak her mind. A lot of her money was given to charity; she also set up an organisation to help the poor, and - even at the peak of her popularity - made special appearances on television shows for children. She spent a lot of time with young people, educating them about the dangers of drugs. She is survived by her husband and son. \u0095 Nazia Hassan, singer, born April 3 1965; died August 13 2000",

He finally tired of her, but when she was killed in an air raid in Belgravia the notorious arch-misogynist was distraught and racked with guilt. The story of Fleming and his lost love has resurfaced with the forthcoming sale of a handful of sepia photographs unearthed in an Oxford antiques shop. The pictures - in three dust-covered family albums - would have held little interest for many, but the collector who bought them was sufficiently intrigued to identify the pre-war figures captured in fading black and white. With only a faded signature to help him, the buyer - remaining anonymous for the time being - discovered the albums' first owner was Violet Wright, Muriel's sister, and that the photographs included several of Fleming's one time lover, from childhood to her 21st birthday just weeks before they met. The albums cover 1915 to 1935.

Ruth Lelacheur, 30, suffered bruising to the back of her ear and a damaged tooth as a result of the alleged attack by Jonathan Edmonds at Wembley stadium in March last year. Edmonds, 31, of Slough, Berkshire, denied charges of affray and actual bodily harm. Michael Latham, prosecuting, said Miss Lelacheur, a Leicester City fan, was in a family enclosure with her partner and her daughter, Megan, three, when a dispute arose about the presence of Spurs fans. He said Megan fell and Miss Lelacheur felt blows to the ear and to her jaw. After the pictures were shown on Crimewatch, Mr Edmonds went to a police station and denied assault. Mr Latham said Mr Edmonds claimed he was pushed over and hit out in self defence. \"He is saying the blows were not directed at Miss Lelacheur.\" Miss Lelacheur told the court there had been a carnival atmosphere in the ground just before the incident. \"But then not long after kick-off we heard a group of about five to seven Tottenham fans sitting just behind us shouting: 'We are Tottenham, We are Tottenham.' \"A lot of Leicester fans then started shouting that the Spurs fans should not have been in that part of the ground. \"My partner, Jim, called over a supervisor and told him that people were not happy with the situation as things could turn nasty and there were a lot of children around. \"The Spurs fans had stopped shouting at this time and the supervisor told my partner to sit down and shut up and that the fans were not doing anything.\" Shortly afterwards, she was pushed into a gangway and her daughter fell to the floor. \"I then felt several punches.

      "main": "",
