Lundy's seamlessly murmuring bassline and Lewis's bumpy-road drumming lifted Watson into spaces he filled with double-time soliloquies and bluesy phrasing. The unaccompanied circular-breathing display that then followed showcased all the saxophonist's formidable technique. Watson has an explosive stockpile of pyrotechnical effects always close to ignition, but he is also a master of texture. He will impart a rich variety of tone colours to a single repeated warbling sound, or recycle a shapely phrase with barely perceptible shifts of nuance. On Curtis Lundy's ballad Nobody Needs to Know, his swoony Johnny Hodges-style sigh seemed to fill the whole room. The band was as attentively reflective on this piece as it had been unwaveringly fearless on its demanding predecessors. Here were individual and collective skills in a fine balance. Bobby Watson's group is playing at Ronnie Scott's until Saturday. Box office: 020-7439 0747.",

In the short term, the small investor will not notice much difference. In the long term, there could be an opportunity to trade a variety of shares in a number of different countries without many of the barriers that exist at present.</p> <p>The small investor needs simple, low-cost dealing. Dealing costs are still relatively high in the UK and private investors must pay stamp duty on share purchases. For UK investors, trading and holding stocks overseas is even more expensive.</p> <p>Yet private share dealing has boomed within the last year. Much of this enthusiasm for stocks has been fuelled by the growth in the popularity of internet and technology stocks. Many private investors now hold shares in tech stocks whose prices are quoted on the New York-based Nasdaq exchange.</p> <p>The merger between Germany and London is also likely to include a link with the Nasdaq. This would enable the small investor to trade shares across Europe and the United States via one settlement process, and possibly even using one currency.</p> <p>But there are still question marks about how the new exchange will operate. The first challenge is to combine the different technologies used on the German and British markets to create an efficient trading system.</p> <p>Secondly, there has been no decision made yet about whether a UK resident would be able to buy a Nasdaq stock using sterling or euros, or whether investors would still have to make their transactions in dollars and bear the risk of currency fluctuations.</p> <p>There are political issues too. If a London-Frankfurt-Nasdaq link-up is successful, stock markets in countries like France, Holland and Belgium may decide to join too.

      "bodyText": "What does the merger of the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche B\u00f6rse in Frankfurt mean to the private investor? In the short term, the small investor will not notice much difference. In the long term, there could be an opportunity to trade a variety of shares in a number of different countries without many of the barriers that exist at present. The small investor needs simple, low-cost dealing. Dealing costs are still relatively high in the UK and private investors must pay stamp duty on share purchases. For UK investors, trading and holding stocks overseas is even more expensive. Yet private share dealing has boomed within the last year. Much of this enthusiasm for stocks has been fuelled by the growth in the popularity of internet and technology stocks. Many private investors now hold shares in tech stocks whose prices are quoted on the New York-based Nasdaq exchange. The merger between Germany and London is also likely to include a link with the Nasdaq. This would enable the small investor to trade shares across Europe and the United States via one settlement process, and possibly even using one currency. But there are still question marks about how the new exchange will operate. The first challenge is to combine the different technologies used on the German and British markets to create an efficient trading system. Secondly, there has been no decision made yet about whether a UK resident would be able to buy a Nasdaq stock using sterling or euros, or whether investors would still have to make their transactions in dollars and bear the risk of currency fluctuations. There are political issues too. If a London-Frankfurt-Nasdaq link-up is successful, stock markets in countries like France, Holland and Belgium may decide to join too. Negotiations between markets and governments would take time and energy. The good news for private investors is that today's merger may allow them to buy shares in companies outside the UK, but without the prohibitive costs involved at present. It will still be difficult for investors to research foreign companies, however, although the growth of websites providing specialist investment information is making this process easier.",

      "bodyText": "The London and Frankfurt stock exchanges are widely expected to announce the terms of a merger this morning in a move which would mark the crucial move in the restructuring of European share dealing. Members of the LSE board met yesterday evening to discuss details of the deal though, according to some sources, the main outlines of the merger have been agreed. \"It is little more than a question of dotting the is and crossing the ts,\" said one source. The Deutsche B\u00f6rse's board is said to have accepted the terms of the deal at the end of last week, but even if the London exchange's board has finally given its blessing, the two exchanges will have to sell the idea to their memberships. London is in the process of demutualisation while the Frankfurt exchange was expected to take a further step towards broadening its share base tomorrow . If the merger goes ahead as expected it will create Europe's biggest exchange, leaving Euronext - the alliance of the French, Dutch and Belgian exchanges - trailing behind. It would increase the pressure on other exchange's to seek to join the Anglo-German grouping or risk being marginalised. The merger terms are ex pected to involve the creation of a 50/50 joint venture to avoid criticisms that one exchange is effectively taking over the other. British and German blue chip stocks will be traded in London while growth stocks and futures will be located in Frankfurt. Werner Seifert, the chief executive of the Frankfurt exchange will become the chief executive of the merged grouping while Don Cruickshank, chairman of the London exchange, will take on the same role in the merged entity. The US exchange Nasdaq, which has announced its own plans for a pan-European trading platform is expected to a play a role in the new exchange's plans. If the two European exchange's can complete their merger and bring the US exchange on board it would create a formidable player in Europe and the US as well as provide a bridgehead in the Far East where Nasdaq has recently signed a cooperation agreement with the Osaka securities exchange. German stock market officials and senior executives from Nasdaq, including Frank Zarb, the chairman of Nasdaq's parent, the National Association of Securities Dealers, were in London for talks with the LSE yesterday. All the traditional European exchanges are under pressure to put together alliances which would provide the framework which would allow big institutional investors to trade across borders cheaply and efficiently. A combination of technological changes and the emergence of new exchanges has increased the pressure. London and Frankfurt announced plans for an alliance in 1998 and six other exchanges later agreed to join. But an eight-way deal has proved elusive, and earlier this year the Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels exchanges announced their alliance -though they made it clear they would like to see others join, especially London. Yesterday Milan and Madrid were reported to be keen to join the Anglo-German alliance while Zurich - the eighth exchange in the original cooperation programme, will also want to ensure it does not become isolated. One crucial area will be clearing and settlement of trades. The London-Frankfurt merger is expected to exclude the German exchange's share in clearing and settlement provider Clearstream. That could prove a problem. Big institutional players are likely to push their business towards exchanges which offer the prospect of \"netting\" deals off against each other - rather than having to settle each one individually - in order to cut costs.",

      "body": "<p>For the last three weeks we have had a tantalising glimpse of a better life. A life where balancing a demanding job and bringing up children feels not just manageable but pleasurable. Where there is time to do the odd jobs round the house, even to ask the old lady next door if she needs help mowing the lawn. The combination of a very late Easter and the May bank holiday has meant we have enjoyed three consecutive four-day weeks. The world didn't come to a standstill - far from it. Four days on, three days off simply felt much better balanced than five on, two off. Could now be the time to make the four-day week the norm? </p> <p>Despite the rise in part-time work, \"portfolio work\" and other \"non-standard\" forms of employment, the five-days-a-week, eight-hours-a-day job is still the dominant model for full-time employment. In fact, average hours worked in Britain have risen over the last decade - a reversal of a 150-year trend of gradually falling working hours. </p> <p>Thanks to two decades of mass unemployment, public policy has tended to focus on the availability of work. Attempts to improve the content or conditions of work have tended to be seen as jeopardising jobs. It is this that lies behind the government's grudging implementation of the Working Time Directive. But UK social democrats are out of step with their European colleagues in their lack of enthusiasm for measures to reduce hours. </p> <p>Despite expectations, the implementation of the French 35-hour week has been largely successful; indeed, many French employees are moving to a week of four long days. In Holland, all workers have the opportunity to renegotiate full-time jobs on a part-time basis, and the Belgian health minister, Frank Vandenbroucke, recently spoke of \"the argument for a generalised voluntary access to a four-day week\", a measure that has now been inserted in public employment agreements. </p> <p>While the priority for Brown and Blair is for the UK to \"catch up\" with the US economy, they may find many voters would rather pursue the quality of life enjoyed by the Germans, the Dutch and the Danes. The question is not whether the government will have to address the call for better work but whether it takes the lead or drags its heels. </p> <p>Stephen Byers is currently chairing a cross-departmental team to examine improving the work/life balance. Byers and company need to be ambitious. Assuming the current period of economic growth continues, we can expect to see average incomes rise by 30% over the next 10 years. This gives us the opportunity to combine rising affluence with better work. It will mean a major cultural shift in the UK. Opinion polls have found that faced with the choice between more money and fewer hours, UK employees will tend to go for the money. Yet initiatives by employers committed to a better work/life balance have borne fruit. Lloyds TSB's policy of giving branch managers the opportunity to move to four long days, for example, is working for both the company and the staff. If collectively and individually we were prevailed upon to choose greater leisure over growing pay packets, the benefits across society would be immense. </p> <p>Firstly, lower working hours for those in full-time work would bring more people into the labour market - some of the estimated 3m unemployed, for example, or some of the older workers currently clamouring to come back into the labour market. Ultimately, as we live longer, healthier lives, more people will want to continue in employment well beyond the official retirement age. </p> <p>Secondly, families would benefit. Anyone working full time knows it is simply impossible to give enough time and energy to your children. The government recognises the contribution that parents can make to education, whether through helping young children to read or making sure older kids are going to school. But for many parents, while the spirit of good parenting is strong, the exhausted flesh is weak. </p> <p>The same goes for those with other family responsibilities. How many of us would visit elderly relatives more often if only we had the time? </p> <p>Thirdly, communities would be strengthened. For all its talk of communitarianism, the government has failed to go beyond anti-social behaviour orders to articulate a positive policy agenda for making communities stronger. As US sociologist Robert Putnam has shown, we are continuing to lead more isolated and private lives. Yet most people say they would like to put more back into local community life. Lack of time and general exhaustion is the most commonly heard excuse for not standing for the local school governors or attending the residents' association. </p> <p>So what should be done? First, every full-time employee in a firm with over 20 staff should be given the right to have their current job on a four-day-a-week, four-fifths of salary basis, and all new full-time jobs should be advertised on these terms. Of course, the CBI and other employers' organisations will undoubtedly complain that such a move threatens capitalist civilisation as we know it. When they do they should be told, first, that similar measures are being successfully implemented in some companies in the UK and more widely in Europe with no apparent problems. Secondly, employers will get higher productivity out of workers who get three days a week to rest, recuperate and develop other forms of fulfilment and personal development. </p> <p> My second proposal aims to ensure that society as a whole and not just individuals and their families benefit from a reduction in working time. The government should encourage those with more time on their hands to use it to put something back into the community. These measures could range from tax breaks, to underlining the importance of voluntary work as a relevant employment qualification. By definition you cannot force people to be active citizens, but we could certainly remove barriers and create incentives. </p> <p>Perhaps the biggest weakness of my proposal is that as long as the move from five to four days is voluntary, the take up will be low. It is not only an issue of money, it is also that we live in a society in which working hard is seen as a virtue regardless of whether it makes sense. To achieve the shift to a four-day week and all the benefits that will flow from it will require opinion formers to make the case for more balanced ways of living, and more rounded ways of seeing ourselves and the contribution we make. That's why I will be asking the next meeting of the trustees of IPPR to introduce a voluntary four-day week to the Institute and why, if they say yes, I will be one of the first take up the offer.</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>Australia</strong></p> <p><strong>The accused</strong><br> Mark Waugh and Shane Warne accepted what they calculate as a joint sum of about \u00a38,000 for \"supplying information\" to an Indian bookmaker only known as \"John\" during a 1994 tournament in Sri Lanka. They first admitted this to the ACB that year in order to expose a a subsequent bribe attempt from Salim Malik on Australia's tour of Pakistan. The ACB told the ICC, but requested confidentiality. After media exposes, the Australians came clean, and Waugh and Warne gave evidence as the Qayyum enquiry decamped to Melbourne. Warne and Waugh admitted they had been \"naive and stupid\". Few seriously suspected them of match-rigging. </p> <p><strong>The accusers</strong><br> David Hookes,the former Australian batsman who exposed Australia's Indian-bookmaker links on a Melbourne radio station in 1998. </p> <p>Dean Jones,the former Australian batsman who volunteered that he had been offered \u00a350,000 by Indian bookmakers in Sri Lanka in 1992. He wonders: \"What I don't understand is why my information was worth \u00a350,000 and everyone else's supposedly around \u00a310,000?\" </p> <p>A four-year cover-up after Warne and Mark Waugh admitted they had taken money from an Indian bookmaker left the Australian Cricket Board's reputation in tatters. They have since regained esteem by pressing for players found guilty of match-rigging to be banned for life, and calling for the suspension of inconsequential TV tournaments.</p> <p><strong>England</strong></p> <p><strong>The accused</strong><br> Only a purblind commitment to secrecy prevents the ECB from entering the ICC meeting boasting an entirely unblemished record. The mishandling of the Chris Lewis affair, when the ECB was more concerned with its own reputation than with protecting a potential informer, has been a disgrace. Far too long elapsed before Lord MacLaurin, chairman of the ECB, praised Lewis' \"guts'' and underlined that there was no reason for him to face disciplinary action. </p> <p><strong>The accusers</strong><br> Chris Lewis informed the ECB of a meeting with Ashim Kheterpal, a sports promoter, who allegedly asked him to be the middle-man in a \u00a31m sting during last summer's Test series against New Zealand. Kheterpal named three England players who had allegedly taken bungs. The names have not been released and no evidence has been forthcoming. </p> <p>Stephen Fleming, the Kiwi captain, reported a similar approach in the same series. </p> <p>Lord MacLaurin successfully lobbied for an the emergency ICC meeting last month in the wake of the Cronje affair. Now he must force the issue home even if he risks strife within the ICC.</p> <p>England players Adam Hollioake and Dougie Brown both reported approaches by a bookie in the team hotel during England's first appearance in Sharjah, in 1997-98.</p> <p> <strong>India</strong></p> <p><strong>The accused</strong><br> Illegal Indian bookmakers and gamblers - regarded as the prime source of a decade of corruption. Bets range from match results to how many wides are bowled.</p> <p>Jagmohan Dalmiya, president of ICC, who has encouraged the proliferation of televised one-day tournaments, blamed as ideal vehicles for the spread of corruption. Dalmiya has threatened to sue over allegations of irregularities in sale of TV rights. </p> <p>Indian Outlook magazine made allegations against four Indian players, past and present - Mohammad Azharuddin, Aday Jadeja, Nayan Mongia and Kapil Dev. None have sued. </p> <p>Jaywant Lele, Dalmiya supporter, and secretary of Indian board. Claims it is \"impossible'' to fix matches. </p> <p><strong>The accusers</strong><br> The Delhi police: their covert operation has already forced the sacking of South African captain, Hansie Cronje. Among several other arrest warrants issued is one for former Indian star, Ajay Sharma, currently playing near Burnley. </p> <p>Inderjit Singh Bindra, ousted by Dalmiya as president of the Indian board. Accuses Dalmiya of being \"in the grip of the mafia and sharks\". Pressing for right to give evidence to today's ICC meeting. </p> <p>Manoj Prabhakar, former Indian all-rounder, whose allegations of corruption within Indian team were described as \"imaginary and unrealistic\" by a retired Indian chief justice, after a cricket board investigation between 1994 and 1997. Prabhakar has now promised to assist a new Government probe by naming the team-mate who allegedly offered him \u00a340,000 to fix a match between India and Pakistan in Colombo in 1994. The match was rained off.</p> <p><strong>Pakistan</strong></p> <p><strong>The accused</strong><br> Salim Malik - nicknamed \"The Rat\" - has put up no legal defence against accusations by three Australian players - Shane Warne, Tim May and Mark Waugh - that he offered them \u00a3120,000 to throw matches on their Pakistan tour of 1994. This was the start of match-rigging inquiries.</p> <p>Pakistan's players were forced to swear innocence of match-fixing on the Koran after Zimbabwe's victory in the Harare Test in 1995. </p> <p>Suspicions of foul play during the 1999 World Cup in England focus primarily upon Pakistan's 62-run defeat against \"no-hopers\" Bangladesh. Pakistan had already qualified for the final stages and none of their top five batsmen made double figures. </p> <p><strong>The accusers</strong><br> Justice Mohammad Qayyum's report into match-fixing will be available in June. The findings have been widely leaked. He allegedly proposed life bans and swingeing fines for Salim Malik and Mushtaq Ahmed and suggested that Wasim Akram should be fined and stripped of the captaincy. The players have strongly denied any wrongdoing.</p> <p>Sarfraz Nawaz - the former Pakistan and Northamptonshire star and political advisor, has made repeated allegations. He has demanded no mercy for those found guilty, even suggesting in his wildest moment that they should be stoned to death.</p> <p><strong>South Africa</strong></p> <p><strong>The accused</strong><br> Hansie Cronje, previously upheld as the essence of cricketing virtue, was charged by Delhi police with match-fixing last month - and world cricket could no longer ignore its deepening crisis. Cronje, after initial denials, was sacked as South African captain after conceding he had taken around \u00a38,000 from corrupt bookmakers as a down-payment \"for information'' earlier this year. Delhi police tapes concern Cronje's dealings during five one-day internationals in South Africa's one-day series in India earlier this year. Cronje's behaviour during the Centurion Test against England this year has also been questioned. He successfully persuaded England's captain, Nasser Hussain, to accept a double-forfeit of innings, and a run-chase of 240 in 72 overs, so reviving a rain-hit match seemingly consigned to a draw. England won. </p> <p><strong>The accusers</strong><br> Dr Ali Bacher, chief executive of the United Cricket Board, pronounced that \"the UCB and the government have been deceived\".

      "bodyText": "Australia The accused Mark Waugh and Shane Warne accepted what they calculate as a joint sum of about \u00a38,000 for \"supplying information\" to an Indian bookmaker only known as \"John\" during a 1994 tournament in Sri Lanka. They first admitted this to the ACB that year in order to expose a a subsequent bribe attempt from Salim Malik on Australia's tour of Pakistan. The ACB told the ICC, but requested confidentiality. After media exposes, the Australians came clean, and Waugh and Warne gave evidence as the Qayyum enquiry decamped to Melbourne. Warne and Waugh admitted they had been \"naive and stupid\". Few seriously suspected them of match-rigging. The accusers David Hookes,the former Australian batsman who exposed Australia's Indian-bookmaker links on a Melbourne radio station in 1998. Dean Jones,the former Australian batsman who volunteered that he had been offered \u00a350,000 by Indian bookmakers in Sri Lanka in 1992. He wonders: \"What I don't understand is why my information was worth \u00a350,000 and everyone else's supposedly around \u00a310,000?\" A four-year cover-up after Warne and Mark Waugh admitted they had taken money from an Indian bookmaker left the Australian Cricket Board's reputation in tatters. They have since regained esteem by pressing for players found guilty of match-rigging to be banned for life, and calling for the suspension of inconsequential TV tournaments. England The accused Only a purblind commitment to secrecy prevents the ECB from entering the ICC meeting boasting an entirely unblemished record. The mishandling of the Chris Lewis affair, when the ECB was more concerned with its own reputation than with protecting a potential informer, has been a disgrace. Far too long elapsed before Lord MacLaurin, chairman of the ECB, praised Lewis' \"guts'' and underlined that there was no reason for him to face disciplinary action. The accusers Chris Lewis informed the ECB of a meeting with Ashim Kheterpal, a sports promoter, who allegedly asked him to be the middle-man in a \u00a31m sting during last summer's Test series against New Zealand. Kheterpal named three England players who had allegedly taken bungs. The names have not been released and no evidence has been forthcoming. Stephen Fleming, the Kiwi captain, reported a similar approach in the same series. Lord MacLaurin successfully lobbied for an the emergency ICC meeting last month in the wake of the Cronje affair. Now he must force the issue home even if he risks strife within the ICC. England players Adam Hollioake and Dougie Brown both reported approaches by a bookie in the team hotel during England's first appearance in Sharjah, in 1997-98. India The accused Illegal Indian bookmakers and gamblers - regarded as the prime source of a decade of corruption. Bets range from match results to how many wides are bowled. Jagmohan Dalmiya, president of ICC, who has encouraged the proliferation of televised one-day tournaments, blamed as ideal vehicles for the spread of corruption. Dalmiya has threatened to sue over allegations of irregularities in sale of TV rights. Indian Outlook magazine made allegations against four Indian players, past and present - Mohammad Azharuddin, Aday Jadeja, Nayan Mongia and Kapil Dev. None have sued. Jaywant Lele, Dalmiya supporter, and secretary of Indian board. Claims it is \"impossible'' to fix matches. The accusers The Delhi police: their covert operation has already forced the sacking of South African captain, Hansie Cronje. Among several other arrest warrants issued is one for former Indian star, Ajay Sharma, currently playing near Burnley. Inderjit Singh Bindra, ousted by Dalmiya as president of the Indian board. Accuses Dalmiya of being \"in the grip of the mafia and sharks\". Pressing for right to give evidence to today's ICC meeting. Manoj Prabhakar, former Indian all-rounder, whose allegations of corruption within Indian team were described as \"imaginary and unrealistic\" by a retired Indian chief justice, after a cricket board investigation between 1994 and 1997. Prabhakar has now promised to assist a new Government probe by naming the team-mate who allegedly offered him \u00a340,000 to fix a match between India and Pakistan in Colombo in 1994. The match was rained off. Pakistan The accused Salim Malik - nicknamed \"The Rat\" - has put up no legal defence against accusations by three Australian players - Shane Warne, Tim May and Mark Waugh - that he offered them \u00a3120,000 to throw matches on their Pakistan tour of 1994. This was the start of match-rigging inquiries. Pakistan's players were forced to swear innocence of match-fixing on the Koran after Zimbabwe's victory in the Harare Test in 1995. Suspicions of foul play during the 1999 World Cup in England focus primarily upon Pakistan's 62-run defeat against \"no-hopers\" Bangladesh. Pakistan had already qualified for the final stages and none of their top five batsmen made double figures. The accusers Justice Mohammad Qayyum's report into match-fixing will be available in June. The findings have been widely leaked. He allegedly proposed life bans and swingeing fines for Salim Malik and Mushtaq Ahmed and suggested that Wasim Akram should be fined and stripped of the captaincy. The players have strongly denied any wrongdoing. Sarfraz Nawaz - the former Pakistan and Northamptonshire star and political advisor, has made repeated allegations. He has demanded no mercy for those found guilty, even suggesting in his wildest moment that they should be stoned to death. South Africa The accused Hansie Cronje, previously upheld as the essence of cricketing virtue, was charged by Delhi police with match-fixing last month - and world cricket could no longer ignore its deepening crisis. Cronje, after initial denials, was sacked as South African captain after conceding he had taken around \u00a38,000 from corrupt bookmakers as a down-payment \"for information'' earlier this year. Delhi police tapes concern Cronje's dealings during five one-day internationals in South Africa's one-day series in India earlier this year. Cronje's behaviour during the Centurion Test against England this year has also been questioned. He successfully persuaded England's captain, Nasser Hussain, to accept a double-forfeit of innings, and a run-chase of 240 in 72 overs, so reviving a rain-hit match seemingly consigned to a draw. England won. The accusers Dr Ali Bacher, chief executive of the United Cricket Board, pronounced that \"the UCB and the government have been deceived\". Bacher then voiced suspicions that matches in last summer's World Cup in England had been fixed. Recognises that South Africa's honour can only be satisfied by a no-holds-barred independent enquiry. Team-mates have questioned the validity of Cronje's Centurion Test declaration. \"Out of character,'' according to Brian McMillan. \"Unbelievable,'' said Allan Donald. Another player has spoken of Cronje ruling in \"a culture of fear\". Cronje's bizarre new-ball attack of Derek Crookes and Henry Williams in a one-day international in Nagpur is the result, according to Delhi police, of bookmaker dealings. Crookes has said he was \"amazed\". And South Africa's physio revealed that Williams had a torn shoulder, but played anyway; he broke down after one over. Sri Lanka The accused Australia's captain Allan Border called it \"the greatest heist since the Great Train Robbery\". Sri Lanka, with a first innings lead of 291 and standing at 127 for two in their second innings, with only 181 required for victory, lost the first Test in Colombo in 1992 by 16 runs after collapsing in dramatic fashion. (This is the same tour where the Australian Dean Jones was offered \u00a350,000 in a biscuit tin.) Crucially, it is known that an illegal bookmaker approached at least three Sri Lankan players around that time at the Great Chinese Wall restaurant in Colombo. Following Sri Lanka's 1996 World Cup win, a Sri Lankan player was allegedly offered \u00a3320,000 by a bookmaker in Sharjah. He refused. The accusers Sidath Wettimuny, Sri Lanka's representative at the ICC meeting, now a match referee, has confirmed reports that Roshan Mahanama informed him that he had refused bookmakers' blandishments. Two other players - Asanka Gurunsinha and Sanath Jayasuriya - refused to co-operate. All pleaded for police protection. Tyronne Fernando, then the Board's president, said: \"Such things were new to us then. We should have taken it more seriously\".",

He once persuaded his Tesco employer Lord Cohen to abandon Green Shield Stamps and the policy of piling it high and selling it cheap. But even he, as chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board, must be wondering what positive outcomes can emanate from the emergency meeting of the International Cricket Council at Lord's over the next two days. </p> <p>The meeting has been called at MacLaurin's behest in the wake of the allegations of corruption which have dominated cricket in the few weeks since the former South Africa captain Hansie Cronje was exposed as someone who had taken payments from Asian bookmakers in exchange for match information. </p> <p>Over the years the ICC has gained a reputation as a purveyor of junkets and inaction, but this, MacLaurin said, was one issue which must be addressed without delay. The council, the governing body of international cricket, had not only to act but be seen to do so. Already, though, MacLaurin's idea has been compromised. </p> <p>It was proposed to Jagmohan Dalmiya, the ICC president, that the meeting should comprise not only board presidents or chairmen but their chief executives or secretaries as well, who oversee what MacLaurin called \"the day-to-day running of the ship\". This has not been adopted. </p> <p>The meeting will be attended by the ICC president and the president-elect, the Australian Malcolm Gray, who takes over from Dalmiya in July, chairmen from the nine test-playing countries, three representatives of the associate members, the heads of the three main ICC committees, including South Africa's Ali Bacher who can be expected to be at the forefront of discussion, and the ICC chief executive David Richards. </p> <p>\"It is important to address the issue of confidence in the sport,\" said Richards. \"What we must do is assure all those people who support and love our sport that they know they can have complete confidence that every game is played in a truly competitive fashion. There can be no contrived results nor any misdemeanours perpetrated by any players.\" </p> <p>These are grand words but the chances of any confidence emerging from the next few days are slim. The president himself has come under fire this week, with allegations from an Indian finance expert, called in by the national television station to investigate the distribution of television rights, that he abused his position to line his pockets. Dal-miya has instigated litigation. </p> <p>He is certain to receive questioning on this but first the meeting has to go through an agenda, set by the president, which includes his own address, a discussion paper from Richards and then a concentration on countries other than the president's own, India, despite the belief that the power base of corruption lies there. </p> <p>Cronje will be discussed at length, as no doubt will Chris Lewis, Shane Warne and Mark Waugh. The claims of Stephen Fleming, the New Zealand captain, will come up. But this is trying to treat spots with Clearasil when the patient has measles. And, as with Sherlock Holmes's dog that did not bark, it is the things that are missing which are of most significance. </p> <p>Where, for instance, is Justice Qayyum's report into match-fixing in Pakistan, a painstaking document that took two years to research and is believed to contain specific allegations and recommendations for punishment against a number of cricketers - perhaps as many as seven - all but one of whom are still playing. Much to the annoyance of the judge and the cricket world at large, this has been gathering dust since its completion last autumn. </p> <p>According to the Pakistan representative Yawar Saeed he cannot supply the report now because he has been asked to bring it to the full ICC meeting in July and cannot change the plan. And has Dalmiya, a man of considerable influence in his homeland, been able to obtain further details of the investigations by the Delhi police that sparked the chain of events in the first place? Has he even tried? No two pieces of evidence are more crucial to a credible meeting than these. As to what should be discussed, Cronjegate and its peripherals come first. Cronje has admitted only to that with which he has been confronted, and Bacher will be pressed to expand, not least on why there is no judge in place yet to front the promised judicial inquiry in South Africa. Only the Delhi police tapes will move the Cronje issue further. The Lewis revelations are rapidly taking on the mantle of a sideshow, although they should not be dismissed. Will MacLaurin show the minutes taken by Simon Pack, the ECB international teams director, of his meeting with Lewis? </p> <p>The indiscretions of Warne and Waugh, far from being old hat, should be resurrected too, in the light of how far events have moved. Sharjah, the place that many believe holds the key to much of the illicit betting and other scams, should be looked at closely, as indeed should be other venues off the beaten cricket track. Dalmiya has promoted one-day cricket vigorously, using it, he says, as an evangelical tool. </p> <p>There is much in that argument. But there is too much indifferent and irrelevant one-day cricket receiving ICC sanction. On the back of official approval come sponsorship, television deals and the bookies. Where can the line be drawn? </p> <p>The Australians, who kept their heads below the parapet for two years after Warne and Waugh were found out, are going to press strongly for life bans for players who are found to be involved with bookmakers in an illegal fashion. </p> <p>That this should be a matter for discussion is beyond belief; it should be a matter of course. There must be some discussion of specifics, even if match-rigging appears endemic: South Africa's recent matches in India; two matches in last year's World Cup, Pakistan's defeat by Bangladesh and the final itself, which Bacher has suggested were rigged, though he has since backpedalled; the Mandela Trophy in 1994-95, which Bacher has been told was fixed. </p> <p>Sadly the chances are that this, like numerous rancorous meetings before it, will degenerate into a fiesta of accusation and counter-accusation. </p> <p>MacLaurin likes to think not. \"That is up to the chairman of the meeting [Dalmiya],\" he said yesterday. \"He must be strong in the way he handles the meeting. Everyone has to be under the microscope from the president down. </p> <p>\"Everyone associated with cricket might in some way be involved in match-fixing or betting. That means the president, umpires and groundsmen. It is not just the players. There are a lot of areas to look at. </p> <p>\"The worst thing that could happen is that nothing comes out of the meeting. It must not be a talking shop; it must be an action shop. Whatever we decide has to be all-embracing.\" </p> <p>It also has to be now. Next year is too late. Does the ICC have the appetite? Does it, indeed, have the teeth?</p>",

Much to the annoyance of the judge and the cricket world at large, this has been gathering dust since its completion last autumn. According to the Pakistan representative Yawar Saeed he cannot supply the report now because he has been asked to bring it to the full ICC meeting in July and cannot change the plan. And has Dalmiya, a man of considerable influence in his homeland, been able to obtain further details of the investigations by the Delhi police that sparked the chain of events in the first place? Has he even tried? No two pieces of evidence are more crucial to a credible meeting than these. As to what should be discussed, Cronjegate and its peripherals come first. Cronje has admitted only to that with which he has been confronted, and Bacher will be pressed to expand, not least on why there is no judge in place yet to front the promised judicial inquiry in South Africa. Only the Delhi police tapes will move the Cronje issue further. The Lewis revelations are rapidly taking on the mantle of a sideshow, although they should not be dismissed. Will MacLaurin show the minutes taken by Simon Pack, the ECB international teams director, of his meeting with Lewis? The indiscretions of Warne and Waugh, far from being old hat, should be resurrected too, in the light of how far events have moved. Sharjah, the place that many believe holds the key to much of the illicit betting and other scams, should be looked at closely, as indeed should be other venues off the beaten cricket track. Dalmiya has promoted one-day cricket vigorously, using it, he says, as an evangelical tool. There is much in that argument. But there is too much indifferent and irrelevant one-day cricket receiving ICC sanction. On the back of official approval come sponsorship, television deals and the bookies. Where can the line be drawn? The Australians, who kept their heads below the parapet for two years after Warne and Waugh were found out, are going to press strongly for life bans for players who are found to be involved with bookmakers in an illegal fashion. That this should be a matter for discussion is beyond belief; it should be a matter of course. There must be some discussion of specifics, even if match-rigging appears endemic: South Africa's recent matches in India; two matches in last year's World Cup, Pakistan's defeat by Bangladesh and the final itself, which Bacher has suggested were rigged, though he has since backpedalled; the Mandela Trophy in 1994-95, which Bacher has been told was fixed. Sadly the chances are that this, like numerous rancorous meetings before it, will degenerate into a fiesta of accusation and counter-accusation. MacLaurin likes to think not. \"That is up to the chairman of the meeting [Dalmiya],\" he said yesterday. \"He must be strong in the way he handles the meeting. Everyone has to be under the microscope from the president down. \"Everyone associated with cricket might in some way be involved in match-fixing or betting. That means the president, umpires and groundsmen. It is not just the players. There are a lot of areas to look at. \"The worst thing that could happen is that nothing comes out of the meeting. It must not be a talking shop; it must be an action shop. Whatever we decide has to be all-embracing.\" It also has to be now. Next year is too late. Does the ICC have the appetite? Does it, indeed, have the teeth?",

On a difficult pitch, on which the ball frequently stopped and where positive strokes had to be checked, most of the Leicestershire batsmen hit the ball up in the air and gave Sussex some gentle fielding practice. This was a very poor surface for this form of the game Even the increasingly impressive Darren Stevens, their most fluent striker yesterday, chipped tamely to midwicket after hitting four fours in his 42-ball 32. His third wicket partnership of 51 with Ben Smith (19) was the highest of the innings. After that the only belligerence came from Darren Maddy, who hit three fours in his 24 before he too hit the ball up in the air in the manner of a coach engaged in a fielding warm-up. A more composed 39 not out from Aftab Habib gave the Leicestershire bowlers something to work with. Robinson, with four for 23, equalled his best bowling figures in this competition. But Bevan is not getting quality support. \u0095 The South African fast bowler Allan Donald was carried off on a stretcher with a suspected broken rib after a freak accident in an English National League match yesterday. Donald, playing for Warwickshire against Hampshire at Southampton, successfully caught a skied on-drive from Australian Shane Warne but fell backwards on to the top of a wooden advertising board on the boundary as he did so. He collapsed in agony, clutching the right side of his lower back.",

      "body": "<p>It might have been Bramall Lane rather than Wembley but the women's FA Cup final proved as contentious as any men's final of recent years. </p> <p>The Premier League leaders Croydon moved nearer to their second double in five years after a controversy-laden second half which saw the 18-year-old midfielder Gemma Hunt score a disputed winning goal and the player of the year Karen Walker miss a penalty for Doncaster. </p> <p>Hunt, who was later carried off after falling awkwardly, saw her 65th-minute shot ricochet off both posts before Leanne Hall got a hand to it. The lineswoman Gillian Armstrong said the ball had crossed the line and, despite Doncaster protests, the goal stood. </p> <p>Only a few minutes earlier Croydon's goalkeeper Pauline Cope made a fine save from Walker's well struck penalty. </p> <p>\"I have no problem with the goal,\" said Croydon's player-coach Debbie Bampton. \"The referee said it was a goal. I felt we'd played the better football anyway, at least in the second half.\" </p> <p>Doncaster flattered to deceive, their attractive passing frequently petering out in the final third. By contrast, Croydon's direct football and spirit would have been good enough to impress the manager whose teams they have most often been compared to, Tottenham's George Graham. </p> <p>\"I do feel we are seen as not being as attractive as other sides or perhaps simply not as fashionable,\" Bampton said. \"But for much of the second half Doncaster did little more than hoof the ball in the air towards the strikers.\" </p> <p>After an indifferent start by both sides Doncaster gained the upper hand. With Gill Coultard anchoring the midfield the Belles stroked the ball around, their build-ups spoiled only by their failure to exploit numerous chances.

      "bodyText": "It might have been Bramall Lane rather than Wembley but the women's FA Cup final proved as contentious as any men's final of recent years. The Premier League leaders Croydon moved nearer to their second double in five years after a controversy-laden second half which saw the 18-year-old midfielder Gemma Hunt score a disputed winning goal and the player of the year Karen Walker miss a penalty for Doncaster. Hunt, who was later carried off after falling awkwardly, saw her 65th-minute shot ricochet off both posts before Leanne Hall got a hand to it. The lineswoman Gillian Armstrong said the ball had crossed the line and, despite Doncaster protests, the goal stood. Only a few minutes earlier Croydon's goalkeeper Pauline Cope made a fine save from Walker's well struck penalty. \"I have no problem with the goal,\" said Croydon's player-coach Debbie Bampton. \"The referee said it was a goal. I felt we'd played the better football anyway, at least in the second half.\" Doncaster flattered to deceive, their attractive passing frequently petering out in the final third. By contrast, Croydon's direct football and spirit would have been good enough to impress the manager whose teams they have most often been compared to, Tottenham's George Graham. \"I do feel we are seen as not being as attractive as other sides or perhaps simply not as fashionable,\" Bampton said. \"But for much of the second half Doncaster did little more than hoof the ball in the air towards the strikers.\" After an indifferent start by both sides Doncaster gained the upper hand. With Gill Coultard anchoring the midfield the Belles stroked the ball around, their build-ups spoiled only by their failure to exploit numerous chances. All too frequently Vicky Exley and Coultard sliced open the Croydon defence and then saw Walker and Mel Garside fire wide. So it was a shock when Croydon went ahead. Bampton swung in a cross and Carmaine Walker rose high above the Belles defence to head firmly home. Scoring with their first shot on target galvanised Croy don and they started to show why they have dominated the league this season. Yet Doncaster equalised 14 minutes later when a cross from Karen Walker found Exley, who headed home. With parity re-established the game opened up. Doncaster started the second half playing the better football but, after Walker's missed penalty and Hunt's controversial goal, they became short of ideas. \"Of course I'm disappointed,\" Coultard said. \"But the important thing is a few years ago we used to win every game four or five-nil. Now there are several teams of the same standard as us and that means women's football is becoming a more exciting and enjoyable game.\" Doncaster Belles: Hall; Gomersal, Embleton, Lowe, Utley, Jackson, Thomas (Borman, 68min), Coultard, K Walker, Garside (Abrahams, 82), Exley. Croydon: Cope, Barber, Fletcher, Hunt (Mapes, 82), Wilie, Loizou, Arnold, Bampton, C Walker, Broadhurst, Proctor. Referee: J Frampton. (Dorset).",

As his disastrous reign was brought to an end, the Norwegian branded his team \"disloyal\" and virulenty castigated Joe Kinnear. </p> <p>Olsen's tactics, personality and managerial style have been criticised almost from day one, not least internally. After an eighth straight defeat at Bradford on Sunday John Hartson called for a change of manager. Beforehand Kinnear had delivered a withering attack. As Olsen headed for the exit with the club in the relegation zone, he bit back. </p> <p>\"I thought I would see out the season,\" he said, \"but there has been disloyalty from players. The comments from Joe Kinnear didn't help my case. I would never do what he did and criticise a manager before a crucial game. It is bad timing but that's the culture of English football.\" </p> <p>It was the unique culture of Wimbledon - with its brashness and anarchy - that the quiet, regimented Olsen struggled to come to terms with. He looks a victim of player power and in a desperate attempt to stay up the club have turned to one of the old-style Crazy Gang. Terry Burton, with 12 years' service as coach and technical director, steps in for the last games at home to Aston Villa and at Southampton. </p> <p>He will enjoy the bond and respect Olsen never seemed to manage. The former Norway manager's long-ball style was supposed to be tailor-made for Wimbledon but the intricacies of his rigid 4-5-1 system, with its zonal marking, left a queue of disillusioned squad members. Many of his imports failed to integrate, Hartson said. Spirit appeared to drain. </p> <p>Carl Cort complained that he was deployed in a wide role which did not maximise his strengths. Michael Hughes, arguably the squad's most inventive talent, found his lack of height and perceived defensive weakness counted against him. Those two, and others, are expected to leave . </p> <p>\"The one thing I blame myself for is that I never managed to impose my style on the team,\" Olsen said. \"I have been criticised for my way of playing football but I never managed to implement that ... I would have felt really depressed if I had managed to implement what I believed in and still failed but I don't feel as bad as that now.\" </p> <p>It is tempting to heap some blame for that on the players. Having struggled to master the system at first, it appeared a few decided it was not to their liking and lost heart. Olsen never enjoyed the faith which helped him at home. </p> <p>\"Egil's skill has always been his system of playing,\" said Wimbledon's chairman Bjorn Rune Gjelsten. \"The great difference is that in Norway there has been a natural respect for Egil through the results he created. Out here it is a different ball game.\" </p> <p>The captain Kenny Cunningham was flattering in his assessment of Olsen, though the club's decision to ban all other players from talking hinted at different obituaries. \"We have to look at ourselves,\" Cunningham said, \"before we point accusing fingers.\" </p> <p>Gjelsten insisted the media had put Olsen under great pressure. But he accepted he and his business partner Kjell-Inge Rokke should have bought out Sam Hammam on day one, rather than taking 80%. \"There has been a lack of focus and clarity,\" he said. \"Had we been closer to the club we might have done a few things differently.\" </p> <p>Olsen, their appointment, was removed after a late-night meeting on Sunday. Burton, 47, was coaching at Arsenal at 22, spent 5 years as Kinnear's assistant and was most recently academy director. He will be assisted by Mick Harford and Stewart Robson. </p> <p>Yesterday Burton made all the right noises. The last two games would be won, he said, and the spirit was excellent. His role will be reassessed in the summer but already the former Wimbledon players Hans Segers and John Fashanu have expressed interest. </p> <p>Kinnear has also been mentioned, though a return would surely depend on the club staying up. For Olsen it seems management is over. \"It looks now that I don't think I will manage a team again,\" he said. \"I'm somewhere between maybe and no, with the emphasis on no.\" </p> <p>\u0095 John Hartson allegedly instigated a fight with Bradford's Stuart McCall in the tunnel before Sunday's game. Hartson, later sent off for foul and abusive language, \"started to fight\" and was acting \"pretty wild,\" according to Bradford's Gunnar Halle. It is thought McCall was kneed in the stomach. The referee Jeff Winter broke up the fight and if it is included in his report Hartson is likely to be charged by the FA.</p>",

I think he Winter just wanted to get the players out on to the field as quickly as possible.\" </p> <p>Two hotly disputed Peter Beagrie goals - the second of which was immediately followed by Hartson's red card - helped Bradford on their way to a crunch win which was rounded off by Dean Windass' 10th of the season. </p> <p>It also sparked Egil Olsen's sacking less than 24 hours later, but Bradford chairman Geoffrey Richmond has revealed Wimbledon's crisis will not distract his club from their \"life-and-death battle\" for Premiership survival. </p> <p>The Bantams' fate is now in their hands, although Olsen's departure could prove the tonic the nosediving Dons need going into their last two games of the season following a harrowing run of eight straight defeats. </p> <p>With Wimbledon now in the bottom three for the first time this season, it has prompted a number of old boys - Vinnie Jones, John Fashanu and Lawrie Sanchez - to offer their help to save the club from the drop. </p> <p>Wimbledon are at home to Aston Villa on Saturday and then face Southampton at The Dell on the final day of the season, while Bradford travel to Leicester before hosting Liverpool. </p> <p>Richmond said: \"It's now become a two-game season - just nine days in May. But we will not be distracted by matters we cannot control. What happened at Wimbledon is an internal matter and of no concern to us. </p> <p>\"For the first time our situation is now in our hands, and if we win both games then it doesn't matter what anybody else does. </p> <p>\"There is this belief that we can do it - no matter what people say - because we have always been positive at all times. What is happening has grabbed people's imagination. It's become a classic life-and-death battle - it's what we are in the game for.\" </p> <p>City boss Paul Jewell, meanwhile, will again take his team away in the build-up to the game at Filbert Street as they look to avoid all the attention and hype surrounding the match. </p> <p>Jewell will tomorrow head to the same secret retreat Bradford visited last week in the hope it proves an omen as they look for the win which could preserve their top-flight status. </p>",

But McCall's comments could ultimately now help Hartson - later dismissed during the game for abusing linesman Alan Sheffield - escape serious sanctions. \"John Hartson was trying to wind up his own team, and I think he got carried away a little bit,\" said McCall. \"He was obviously psyching himself up for the match and trying to get the old Wimbledon 'Crazy Gang' spirit going. \"It must have been frustrating for him to see the club where they are near the bottom of the table, especially because he had been out injured for four months. \"It was mainly him trying to get the team going, but we have experience in our side not to be intimidated by that sort of thing. \"I admit the dressing-room corridor at Valley Parade is so narrow that the players are bound to be close to each other as they line up before they go on to the pitch. \"But there was no physical contact between the players, just a lot of shouting - and the referee wanted him to be quiet. I think he Winter just wanted to get the players out on to the field as quickly as possible.\" Two hotly disputed Peter Beagrie goals - the second of which was immediately followed by Hartson's red card - helped Bradford on their way to a crunch win which was rounded off by Dean Windass' 10th of the season. It also sparked Egil Olsen's sacking less than 24 hours later, but Bradford chairman Geoffrey Richmond has revealed Wimbledon's crisis will not distract his club from their \"life-and-death battle\" for Premiership survival. The Bantams' fate is now in their hands, although Olsen's departure could prove the tonic the nosediving Dons need going into their last two games of the season following a harrowing run of eight straight defeats. With Wimbledon now in the bottom three for the first time this season, it has prompted a number of old boys - Vinnie Jones, John Fashanu and Lawrie Sanchez - to offer their help to save the club from the drop. Wimbledon are at home to Aston Villa on Saturday and then face Southampton at The Dell on the final day of the season, while Bradford travel to Leicester before hosting Liverpool. Richmond said: \"It's now become a two-game season - just nine days in May. But we will not be distracted by matters we cannot control. What happened at Wimbledon is an internal matter and of no concern to us. \"For the first time our situation is now in our hands, and if we win both games then it doesn't matter what anybody else does. \"There is this belief that we can do it - no matter what people say - because we have always been positive at all times. What is happening has grabbed people's imagination. It's become a classic life-and-death battle - it's what we are in the game for.\" City boss Paul Jewell, meanwhile, will again take his team away in the build-up to the game at Filbert Street as they look to avoid all the attention and hype surrounding the match. Jewell will tomorrow head to the same secret retreat Bradford visited last week in the hope it proves an omen as they look for the win which could preserve their top-flight status.",

The deal for the South American star was aborted earlier this year when Robson was unable to raise the \u00a33.6m transfer fee. Gianluca Vialli says he will buy British from now on. Chelsea are thought to be interested in Jamie Redknapp, Robbie Fowler, Frank Lampard and Trevor Sinclair, Andy Cole and Richard Wright. Des Walker will leave Sheffield Wednesday at the end of the season. West Ham are likely to repeat their \u00a31.5m offer from earlier this season and Charlton, Manchester City and Coventry are also interested. * * * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF John Hartson could be charged with misconduct by the FA after he was allegedly involved in a scuffle with Bradford midfielder Stuart McCall in the tunnel before Wimbledon's 3-0 defeat at Valley Parade on Sunday. Liverpool and Reebok have signed the biggest kit sponsorship deal in the Premiership, worth \u00a321m over the next three seasons. David Ginola has denied claiming that he has wasted the best years of his career by playing in English football. \"I've never said that I was wasting my time playing in the English Premiership. I am very grateful that I play in one of the strongest leagues in the world. I loved the time I played at Newcastle and I love it at Tottenham.\" Joe Royle has been named Nationwide manager of the month for April. Burnley's Stan Ternent won the Division Two award, while Kevin Wilson of Northampton was named the top Division Three manager. Nicholas Anelka will start for Real Madrid in their Champions League semi-final against Bayern Munich tomorrow, because Fernando Morientes is injured. * * * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO ITV: The Big Match (11.30pm) Obviously not as big as it used to be, given its new time.

      "bodyText": "William Hague has succeeded, with two carefully timed speeches, to dominate the entire political landscape over the past two weeks. Tory spinners are delighted with the blanket coverage they have won for their leader's provocative interventions on asylum seekers and on the farmer Tony Martin so soon before the spring elections. His outbursts are likely to pay dividends when the Tories regain the safe seat of Romsey in Thursday's by-election and when they notch up local election successes around the country. Tory shadow ministers will pop up on Friday morning to claim they have recovered from the trauma of 1997 and they are now on course for a strong performance in the general election. However, Tories will privately know that any victories this week will show that the party is merely consolidating its core vote and is a long way from reaching out to the broader electorate who will decide the next election. The Tories should win Romsey with no effort because it is one of the party's safest seats, while Conservatives are bound to do well in the council election because Labour and the Liberal Democrats are defending seats they won at the height of the Tories' unpopularity in the mid 1990s. It is against this background that Mr Hague has spoken out in the past few weeks as he panders to his party's core supporters with threats to lock up all asylum seekers and rally to the defence of the likes of the farmer Tony Martin. The Tory leader denied today that he was lurching to the right, declaring that he was appealing to the \"common sense\" values of ordinary voters. \"These are not right-wing themes,\" he told Radio 4's Today programme as he prepared to travel down to Romsey. \"Labour voters, people who voted Liberal in the past are saying to me these are the sort of things which we should be raising. We must not be browbeaten out of raising this subject because other people want to distort the way we raise it.\" However, the Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy used a campaign speech in Romsey last night to round on Mr Hague for his opportunism in recent weeks. \"He will stand anywhere for a favourable tabloid headline,\" Mr Kennedy said.

      "body": "<p>The British embassy in Paris, a former palace on the exclusive Rue du Faubourg St Honor\u00e9 near the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, is one of the splendours of the French capital. So too is its entertainment budget.</p> <p>The embassy spent \u00a3293,125, which buys a lot of canapes and wine, in the last financial year. It is the biggest-spending British embassy, its entertainment budget higher than Washington, Tokyo and Moscow, the centres of world political and economic power.</p> <p>Opposition MPs questioned yesterday if the spending was a reflection of France's historical importance rather than a reflection of its position in the present world.</p> <p>Previously unpublished Foreign Office figures obtained by the Guardian reveal that Paris topped the entertainment league table of British embassies in 1997-98 and 1998-99 followed by Tokyo, New York, Brussels and Washington. The top 15 embassies in the entertainment league spent about \u00a32m in the last financial year.</p> <p>The Foreign Office minister, Baroness Scotland, said: \"All such expenditure is, of course, to promote UK interests: winning support for our policies and products from businessmen, politicians, the media and other decision-makers.\"</p> <p>One of the diplomats at the Paris embassy, Tim Livesey, was unapologetic: Paris was expensive.\"You try entertaining 16,000 in Paris as opposed to doing so in Abu Dhabi.\"</p> <p>The embassy hosted visits for ministers, provided candle-lit dinners for French politicians and opinion-formers, and held parties and receptions, mainly to help provide a showcase for British products.</p> <p>Mr Livesey said: \"If you are in Washington, you are looking at a political kind of market. In New York, you are looking at movers and shakers. In Los Angeles, it is the movie industry.\"</p> <p>But in France, if you wanted to influence people, \"you did it in Paris because it is a very centralised country. When you entertain, you entertain the whole of France\".</p> <p>Matthew Taylor, the Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, said: \"It seems how much they spend depends on how much they spent in the 19th century rather than its importance in the 20th century, never mind the 21st.\"</p> <p>In the past, the Paris embassy would have concentrated on gathering political intelligence and trying to influence opinion. Mr Livesey said that had changed in favour of the commercial side.</p> <p>Last year, the embassy and the residency had hosted 50 special events, including promotion of such things as British fabrics. British cheese was served on all occasions at the embassy and British wine much of the time.</p> <p>After unfavourable publicity in the mid-1990s about diplomats overseas enjoying a seemingly extravagant lifestyle, the Treasury tightened up on spending.</p> <p>The latest figures appear to show spending is down in Tokyo, New York, Madrid, Rome and Geneva. The Paris embassy's expenditure rose over the same period, though only marginally. More importantly, its spending was down dramatically from 1993-94 when it spent \u00a3331,000 in entertainment.</p> <p>Regulars at embassy events have noticed little difference. The Foreign Office itself admitted the reduction was not as dramatic as the figures suggested, saying there were various factors at play, such as the high pound working in favour of the embassies.</p> <p>A dramatic example of currency fluctuations was in Moscow, where spending on entertainment dropped from \u00a3126,243 in 1997-98 to \u00a383,455 in 1998-99 due to the decline in the value of the rouble.</p> <p>Brussels also saw a substantial drop, from \u00a3240,320 to \u00a3184,071. New Delhi, the fourth highest in 1997-98, spending \u00a3134,091, dropped out of the top 15 last year.</p> <p>The Foreign Office has 223 overseas posts, and 5,635 staff, of whom 2,295 are based overseas. In addition, there are 7,841 local staff. Paris in the mid-1990s employed 89 staff, including four footmen, a butler and a gardener, as well as 142 local staff. Mr Livesey said this had been cut back to a total of about 160.</p> <p>Paris's entertainment rival is Washington where the ambassador, Sir Christopher Meyer, formerly prime ministerial spokesman for John Major, has made it an important part of the Washington social scene. Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones were the star attractions as the ambassador's ball.</p> <p>The embassy claims to have had 14,500 visitors in the past year, increasing the costs while keeping the numbers down. Sir Christopher thought the term entertaining was misleading: \"Entertaining is not really the right word.

      "bodyText": "The British embassy in Paris, a former palace on the exclusive Rue du Faubourg St Honor\u00e9 near the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, is one of the splendours of the French capital. So too is its entertainment budget. The embassy spent \u00a3293,125, which buys a lot of canapes and wine, in the last financial year. It is the biggest-spending British embassy, its entertainment budget higher than Washington, Tokyo and Moscow, the centres of world political and economic power. Opposition MPs questioned yesterday if the spending was a reflection of France's historical importance rather than a reflection of its position in the present world. Previously unpublished Foreign Office figures obtained by the Guardian reveal that Paris topped the entertainment league table of British embassies in 1997-98 and 1998-99 followed by Tokyo, New York, Brussels and Washington. The top 15 embassies in the entertainment league spent about \u00a32m in the last financial year. The Foreign Office minister, Baroness Scotland, said: \"All such expenditure is, of course, to promote UK interests: winning support for our policies and products from businessmen, politicians, the media and other decision-makers.\" One of the diplomats at the Paris embassy, Tim Livesey, was unapologetic: Paris was expensive.\"You try entertaining 16,000 in Paris as opposed to doing so in Abu Dhabi.\" The embassy hosted visits for ministers, provided candle-lit dinners for French politicians and opinion-formers, and held parties and receptions, mainly to help provide a showcase for British products. Mr Livesey said: \"If you are in Washington, you are looking at a political kind of market. In New York, you are looking at movers and shakers. In Los Angeles, it is the movie industry.\" But in France, if you wanted to influence people, \"you did it in Paris because it is a very centralised country. When you entertain, you entertain the whole of France\". Matthew Taylor, the Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, said: \"It seems how much they spend depends on how much they spent in the 19th century rather than its importance in the 20th century, never mind the 21st.\" In the past, the Paris embassy would have concentrated on gathering political intelligence and trying to influence opinion. Mr Livesey said that had changed in favour of the commercial side. Last year, the embassy and the residency had hosted 50 special events, including promotion of such things as British fabrics. British cheese was served on all occasions at the embassy and British wine much of the time. After unfavourable publicity in the mid-1990s about diplomats overseas enjoying a seemingly extravagant lifestyle, the Treasury tightened up on spending. The latest figures appear to show spending is down in Tokyo, New York, Madrid, Rome and Geneva. The Paris embassy's expenditure rose over the same period, though only marginally. More importantly, its spending was down dramatically from 1993-94 when it spent \u00a3331,000 in entertainment. Regulars at embassy events have noticed little difference. The Foreign Office itself admitted the reduction was not as dramatic as the figures suggested, saying there were various factors at play, such as the high pound working in favour of the embassies. A dramatic example of currency fluctuations was in Moscow, where spending on entertainment dropped from \u00a3126,243 in 1997-98 to \u00a383,455 in 1998-99 due to the decline in the value of the rouble. Brussels also saw a substantial drop, from \u00a3240,320 to \u00a3184,071. New Delhi, the fourth highest in 1997-98, spending \u00a3134,091, dropped out of the top 15 last year. The Foreign Office has 223 overseas posts, and 5,635 staff, of whom 2,295 are based overseas. In addition, there are 7,841 local staff. Paris in the mid-1990s employed 89 staff, including four footmen, a butler and a gardener, as well as 142 local staff. Mr Livesey said this had been cut back to a total of about 160. Paris's entertainment rival is Washington where the ambassador, Sir Christopher Meyer, formerly prime ministerial spokesman for John Major, has made it an important part of the Washington social scene. Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones were the star attractions as the ambassador's ball. The embassy claims to have had 14,500 visitors in the past year, increasing the costs while keeping the numbers down. Sir Christopher thought the term entertaining was misleading: \"Entertaining is not really the right word. It's also about creating networks of influence so that, when you need to, you have easy access to people whose decisions can affect British interests for better or worse. Our network at the British embassy has paid off repeatedly to Britain's benefit. That's the way Washington works.\" The Foreign Office complains privately that the image of diplomats having a good time means that they have had to pare down spending and usually it is the embassy buildings that suffer, with insufficient funds for renovation. But Mr Taylor remained unimpressed, especially with the claims that spending on entertainment had been tightened up. \"It may have tightened a little but not as much as the stomachs have grown.\" Top 15 Biggest spenders 1998-99 Paris \u00a3293,125 Tokyo \u00a3221,711 New York \u00a3196,446 Brussels \u00a3184,071 Washington \u00a3112,645 Hong Kong \u00a3103,573 Bonn \u00a3101,809 Geneva \u00a3100,470 Peking \u00a3100,150 Vienna \u00a397,049 Moscow \u00a383,455 Madrid \u00a383,111 Rome \u00a379,936 Seoul \u00a371,009 Buenos Aires \u00a368,408",

Get your nutrients from real food.\" There is a pause and a whimper. \"Sorry, the baby just fell off my breast.\" </p> <p>McKeith is promoting her new book by telephone because she has just given birth. Living Food for Health: 12 Natural Superfoods to Transform Your Health is just one of this month's new books about the miracle healing properties of food. Sprouting beans, it suggests, may cure prostate cancer. </p> <p>The \"alfalfa saved my life\" genre of health books is a growing market. Last year we learnt that lean beef and lamb cure acne, oysters relieve cold sores, dried apricots ease fluid retention, prawns cure colds and yoghurt helps you remember who you are and where you put your wallet. This spring's new releases include Food: Your Miracle Medicine; The Food Pharmacy; Eat Well, Stay Well; Super Juice; Super Herbs; Super Boosters; Detox Your Mind; Detox Your Life; Detox Your Self; Healing from the Inside; Energy Foods; H2O: The Healing Power of Water and The Power Food Cookbook. </p> <p>Borders book shop in London's Oxford Street has three shelves of these titles. The Food Doctor by Ian Marbar and Vicki Edgson has had four reprints since September, and in August, Collins &amp; Brown publish Food Doctor in the City (like Sex in the City, but with mung beans). </p> <p>Recently the line between food and pharmaceuticals has been blurred. The bread and bananas that give you vitamins are no longer foods, they are \"nutraceuticals\". \"The market for books about so-called healing foods is an extension of the market for functional foods such as Yakult and Benecol margarine - which is fortified to lower your cholesterol,\" says \"food psychologist\" Richard Shepherd, who works at Surrey University. \"People want two things: information and an easy cure for illness.\" </p> <p>All these books about healing foods carry disclaimers warning readers not to give up chemotherapy in favour of dried pears. But people, inevitably, have high expectations. \"More and more people are visiting nutritionists not to cure a specific ailment but because they don't feel happy with their lives and expect spinach to solve the problem,\" says Sarah Stanner, a nutrition scientist at the British Nutrition Foundation. </p> <p>Jackie Landman, a public health nutritionist, says a priest told her recently that food therapists were like the clergy. In a secular world, \"cancer-curing\" radish juice is the new religion. There is an evangelism about the language of the new healing nutrition titles: \"miracle foods\", \"food bible\", \"health testament\". Miracle Food Cures from the Bible by Reese Dubin (Prentice Hall, \u00a39.49) claims that the hawthorn featured in Jesus's crown of thorns is a great cure for heart pain. </p> <p>McKeith's Living Food for Health (Piatkus, \u00a36.99) is one of the better researched books. Her London clinic has a two-year waiting list for consultations and she irrigates the colons of the royals, the Hollywood acting establishment and Olympic athletes. A former health consultant to the Joan Rivers television show, she now presents a Feel Fab Forever slot on This Morning with Richard and Judy. </p> <p>McKeith tells you to give your body \"a lube job\" with sprouting grains such as millet, quinoa, flax seeds and barley grass. This will cure spots, warts, brain malfunction, high cholesterol and hormone trouble, she says. It may also cure cancer.

      "bodyText": "Dr Gillian McKeith once found an entire vitamin tablet in one of her stools. \"There it was, gleaming and undigested,\" she says. \"You see, you are not what you eat, you are what you absorb. Get your nutrients from real food.\" There is a pause and a whimper. \"Sorry, the baby just fell off my breast.\" McKeith is promoting her new book by telephone because she has just given birth. Living Food for Health: 12 Natural Superfoods to Transform Your Health is just one of this month's new books about the miracle healing properties of food. Sprouting beans, it suggests, may cure prostate cancer. The \"alfalfa saved my life\" genre of health books is a growing market. Last year we learnt that lean beef and lamb cure acne, oysters relieve cold sores, dried apricots ease fluid retention, prawns cure colds and yoghurt helps you remember who you are and where you put your wallet. This spring's new releases include Food: Your Miracle Medicine; The Food Pharmacy; Eat Well, Stay Well; Super Juice; Super Herbs; Super Boosters; Detox Your Mind; Detox Your Life; Detox Your Self; Healing from the Inside; Energy Foods; H2O: The Healing Power of Water and The Power Food Cookbook. Borders book shop in London's Oxford Street has three shelves of these titles. The Food Doctor by Ian Marbar and Vicki Edgson has had four reprints since September, and in August, Collins &amp; Brown publish Food Doctor in the City (like Sex in the City, but with mung beans). Recently the line between food and pharmaceuticals has been blurred. The bread and bananas that give you vitamins are no longer foods, they are \"nutraceuticals\". \"The market for books about so-called healing foods is an extension of the market for functional foods such as Yakult and Benecol margarine - which is fortified to lower your cholesterol,\" says \"food psychologist\" Richard Shepherd, who works at Surrey University. \"People want two things: information and an easy cure for illness.\" All these books about healing foods carry disclaimers warning readers not to give up chemotherapy in favour of dried pears. But people, inevitably, have high expectations. \"More and more people are visiting nutritionists not to cure a specific ailment but because they don't feel happy with their lives and expect spinach to solve the problem,\" says Sarah Stanner, a nutrition scientist at the British Nutrition Foundation. Jackie Landman, a public health nutritionist, says a priest told her recently that food therapists were like the clergy. In a secular world, \"cancer-curing\" radish juice is the new religion. There is an evangelism about the language of the new healing nutrition titles: \"miracle foods\", \"food bible\", \"health testament\". Miracle Food Cures from the Bible by Reese Dubin (Prentice Hall, \u00a39.49) claims that the hawthorn featured in Jesus's crown of thorns is a great cure for heart pain. McKeith's Living Food for Health (Piatkus, \u00a36.99) is one of the better researched books. Her London clinic has a two-year waiting list for consultations and she irrigates the colons of the royals, the Hollywood acting establishment and Olympic athletes. A former health consultant to the Joan Rivers television show, she now presents a Feel Fab Forever slot on This Morning with Richard and Judy. McKeith tells you to give your body \"a lube job\" with sprouting grains such as millet, quinoa, flax seeds and barley grass. This will cure spots, warts, brain malfunction, high cholesterol and hormone trouble, she says. It may also cure cancer. But you will have to spend an awful lot of time playing around with wet beans: covering them with cheese cloth or muslin, tilting them to 45 degrees and putting them on and off the window ledge for days to make them sprout properly. Aloe vera, it seems, is the Rolls-Royce of healing foods.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It was impossible to ignore it any longer - my belly was bulging. But, unlike excess fat, the bulge didn't disappear when I lay on my back: it just sat there solidly, menacingly, pressing down uncomfortably on my bladder. So I went to see my GP. </p> <p>When a pregnancy test proved negative, as I knew it would, he looked worried. He assured me that the lump could be one of any of a number of \"non-serious\" growths but that we needed to make sure, and then he booked me in for an ultrasound scan. </p> <p>Four weeks later, at University College Hospital in London, the scan revealed a large ovarian cyst. My first reaction was anger. I had spent most of my life eating a balanced diet and exercising regularly, and strongly believed in a preventive, holistic approach to disease. How could my body betray all these years of care and attention by producing an enormous growth in my reproductive system? </p> <p>Reading up on the subject, I discovered that ovarian cysts are, in fact, extremely common but as they have few symptoms, women often discover them only when examined for another gynaecological condition. Cysts smaller than about four centimetres in diameter are simply monitored, since they may dissolve and be reabsorbed by the body without being treated. My cyst, however, had ballooned to 10cm so discreetly that I'll never know when it first appeared or exactly how quickly it grew. </p> <p>There are different types of cysts, depending on their cause and make-up. The ultrasound described mine as fluid-filled, thick-walled and \"unilocular\" - meaning that it has a single cavity; this type is also called a simple cyst. Multichambered cysts containing solid components have more chance of being malignant. The low risk of cancer was comforting, but I was worried that surgery would reveal something other than a simple cyst. </p> <p>Because the ultrasound scan showed that the cyst had expanded my right ovary to about 10cm in circumference the nurse recommended referral to a gynaecologist. She explained there was a danger that the cyst might burst. The weight of the cyst could also cause either it or my ovary to twist round, causing great pain or haemorrhaging. I became hyper-aware of any unusual pain, expecting the cyst to burst at any minute. In bed, I would struggle to get comfortable as this fluid-filled mass wobbled around inside my abdomen, pressing first on my bladder and then on my intestines. </p> <p>When I saw the gynaecologist at my local hospital, he confirmed the need for swift surgery and broached the issue of fertility. A scan isn't a precise diagnostic tool, he explained, and they couldn't be sure exactly what was going on inside my abdomen until they opened me up. They might have to remove one or both ovaries. His stark confirmation of my worst fears sent a chill through me and the anxiety I had been suppressing bubbled over into tears. I went home with the date of my operation and cried all morning. </p> <p>Although I had never felt a strong desire to have children, I had never doubted that, when called on to perform, my reproductive system would acquit itself admirably: I was fit, had never had gynaecological problems and had always opted for alternatives to the contraceptive pill. However, at 37, I was no spring chicken, biologically speaking, and surgery would leave its mark. Ironically, two close friends became pregnant during this period and I was surprised by the strength of my reaction to the announcement. It was a potent mixture of joy for them, jealousy and self-pity - they were carrying babies, I was about to give to give birth to a lump of useless tissue. </p> <p>The operation itself didn't worry me because I trusted my consultant. A friend had worked on a television programme about the unnecessary removal of female reproductive organs during surgery and a check of his credentials allayed any fears that he would whip out my ovaries at the drop of a hat; he had an excellent reputation. The anaesthetic was a different matter. A strong believer in complementary therapies, I balk at even mild painkillers and was terrified of the effect such a strong drug would have on my system. </p> <p>The operation was to take place at 9am. As I was wheeled down to the operating theatre on my hospital bed, I felt incredibly vulnerable: total strangers were going to render me unconscious, cut me open and remove part of my insides. Weird. </p> <p>A friend's hand on my arm woke me from post-operative sleep back on the ward. I opened my eyes to drips, tubes and plastic bags suspended from metal poles - all attached to me. </p> <p>A nurse explained that the \"remote control\" next to my hand would give me a shot of morphine at the touch of a button if the pain became too much. More drugs. I don't know if was a subconscious desire to purge my body of medication, or a strong constitution, but I barely touched the morphine admin istrator and asked for it to be removed next day. Doctors told me that the cyst had been about 14cm in circumference (about the size of a large grapefruit on the frequently used but curious fruit and vegetable scale of the internal growth) and was, in fact, attached to my left ovary. The ultrasound scan had recorded the results of it being squashed around the front of my lower abdomen. </p> <p>Endometriosis is an often painful condition in which bits of the womb's lining, the endometrium, migrate to other areas of the body and become inflamed. Ovarian cysts and endometriosis are often spoken of in the same breath, partly because the latter condition can give rise to \"chocolate\" cysts, so called because they contain old, thick blood. I was surprised when my consultant told me he had also removed one of these chocolate cysts. </p> <p>I had never had the pain or any other symptom connected with endometriosis, and how much room is there on one ovary anyway, for heaven's sake? It's only the size of a walnut. My surgeon painstakingly removed both cysts and then sewed the ovary back together. Another doctor, present during the operation, even stayed behind after the usual morning doctors' round to tell me the procedure had been \"amazingly intricate and beautiful to watch\". </p> <p>After that, the influx of drugs was relentless. As well as the daily painful injection into my thigh of a blood-thinning agent to reduce the risk of thrombosis, there were oral painkillers and anti-inflammatories dished out by the night nurse. The final - and biggest - drug hurdle was the hormone medication commonly used to suppress ovulation in order to give the reproductive system time to recover from surgery. I found it annoying to be asked every morning by an intimidating gaggle of medics whether I had made up my mind about taking it while still decidedly non compos mentis. </p> <p>On one occasion my insistence that I didn't like taking drugs was met with the assertion that, in that case, I could be given a one-off injection that would last three months. </p> <p>These drugs prompt a \"mini-menopause\" and possible side effects include loss of bone density, hot flushes, vaginal dryness, headaches. A doctor agreed with my observation that whatever benefits this drug brought were purely temporary and that if my body was determined to produce another cyst it would do so as soon as the medication stopped. I declined to take it. Other doctors I spoke to said they doubted the benefits of medication that deactivated the ovaries, and one told me that some women can develop simple cysts while taking the pill. </p> <p>This settled, I just wanted to get well enough to go home. For the first few days of my week in hospital, visits to the loo were nerve-racking. I felt any \"straining\" would split my belly open like a ripe watermelon, even though the suture holding together my hip-to-hip wound made me think of a piece of cable from San Fransisco's Golden Gate Bridge, and a nurse assured me that more layers of stitching secured me inside. </p> <p>My stomach ached constantly and I didn't sleep for three days. Finally, one of the night nurses gently ordered me to swallow a sleeping pill to give my body a chance to rest and heal. Seven days after the operation my brother arrived to take me home. </p> <p>Six months on, I'm still angry at how my body has \"let me down\". And angrier still at a GP who told me, when I queried sharp pains in my ovary, that I'd \"never be the same again\". </p> <p>Still, the ovaries are intact and what I thought would be a scar for life across my stomach has all but disappeared. I'm amazed at how the human body can bounce back from physical trauma. I just hope I'm not one of the unlucky few for whom ovarian cysts recur. I don't want to have to bounce back twice. </p> <p><strong>Ovarian cysts: the facts</strong></p> <p> Simple or \"functional\" ovarian cysts are fluid-filled blister-like growths on an ovary. Few are cancerous and doctors tend to take a \"watch and see\" approach to treatment. </p> <p>Functional cysts tend to appear if the ovary produces too much oestrogen. Although common, especially in young women, they are usually small and disappear on their own in about three months. Most will cause no symptoms: you will feel nothing and probably never know you have a cyst. </p> <p>But some functional cysts do grow large enough to cause problems. Symptoms may include a dull ache, bloating, pain during sex and irregular or painful periods. </p> <p>If a large cyst breaks open, it can cause severe pain and swelling in the lower belly. The pill may help, but in extreme cases, when the cyst has grown larger than a tennis ball, surgery may be necessary. </p> <p>Functional cysts are different from those associated with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a hormonal condition thought to affect up to one in 10 women. Polycystic ovaries have a string of cysts around them (in what is often described as \"a pearl necklace effect\"). PCOS often goes undiagnosed because the symptoms are similar to those of premenstrual tension: weight gain, spots, tiredness, breast pain and depression. </p> <p>But the condition can also cause excess body hair and infertility. The treatment - generally involving hormone pills - will depend on whether or not you are trying to get pregnant.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It was impossible to ignore it any longer - my belly was bulging. But, unlike excess fat, the bulge didn't disappear when I lay on my back: it just sat there solidly, menacingly, pressing down uncomfortably on my bladder. So I went to see my GP. When a pregnancy test proved negative, as I knew it would, he looked worried. He assured me that the lump could be one of any of a number of \"non-serious\" growths but that we needed to make sure, and then he booked me in for an ultrasound scan. Four weeks later, at University College Hospital in London, the scan revealed a large ovarian cyst. My first reaction was anger. I had spent most of my life eating a balanced diet and exercising regularly, and strongly believed in a preventive, holistic approach to disease. How could my body betray all these years of care and attention by producing an enormous growth in my reproductive system? Reading up on the subject, I discovered that ovarian cysts are, in fact, extremely common but as they have few symptoms, women often discover them only when examined for another gynaecological condition. Cysts smaller than about four centimetres in diameter are simply monitored, since they may dissolve and be reabsorbed by the body without being treated. My cyst, however, had ballooned to 10cm so discreetly that I'll never know when it first appeared or exactly how quickly it grew. There are different types of cysts, depending on their cause and make-up. The ultrasound described mine as fluid-filled, thick-walled and \"unilocular\" - meaning that it has a single cavity; this type is also called a simple cyst. Multichambered cysts containing solid components have more chance of being malignant. The low risk of cancer was comforting, but I was worried that surgery would reveal something other than a simple cyst. Because the ultrasound scan showed that the cyst had expanded my right ovary to about 10cm in circumference the nurse recommended referral to a gynaecologist. She explained there was a danger that the cyst might burst. The weight of the cyst could also cause either it or my ovary to twist round, causing great pain or haemorrhaging. I became hyper-aware of any unusual pain, expecting the cyst to burst at any minute. In bed, I would struggle to get comfortable as this fluid-filled mass wobbled around inside my abdomen, pressing first on my bladder and then on my intestines. When I saw the gynaecologist at my local hospital, he confirmed the need for swift surgery and broached the issue of fertility. A scan isn't a precise diagnostic tool, he explained, and they couldn't be sure exactly what was going on inside my abdomen until they opened me up. They might have to remove one or both ovaries. His stark confirmation of my worst fears sent a chill through me and the anxiety I had been suppressing bubbled over into tears. I went home with the date of my operation and cried all morning. Although I had never felt a strong desire to have children, I had never doubted that, when called on to perform, my reproductive system would acquit itself admirably: I was fit, had never had gynaecological problems and had always opted for alternatives to the contraceptive pill. However, at 37, I was no spring chicken, biologically speaking, and surgery would leave its mark. Ironically, two close friends became pregnant during this period and I was surprised by the strength of my reaction to the announcement. It was a potent mixture of joy for them, jealousy and self-pity - they were carrying babies, I was about to give to give birth to a lump of useless tissue. The operation itself didn't worry me because I trusted my consultant. A friend had worked on a television programme about the unnecessary removal of female reproductive organs during surgery and a check of his credentials allayed any fears that he would whip out my ovaries at the drop of a hat; he had an excellent reputation. The anaesthetic was a different matter. A strong believer in complementary therapies, I balk at even mild painkillers and was terrified of the effect such a strong drug would have on my system. The operation was to take place at 9am. As I was wheeled down to the operating theatre on my hospital bed, I felt incredibly vulnerable: total strangers were going to render me unconscious, cut me open and remove part of my insides. Weird. A friend's hand on my arm woke me from post-operative sleep back on the ward. I opened my eyes to drips, tubes and plastic bags suspended from metal poles - all attached to me. A nurse explained that the \"remote control\" next to my hand would give me a shot of morphine at the touch of a button if the pain became too much. More drugs. I don't know if was a subconscious desire to purge my body of medication, or a strong constitution, but I barely touched the morphine admin istrator and asked for it to be removed next day. Doctors told me that the cyst had been about 14cm in circumference (about the size of a large grapefruit on the frequently used but curious fruit and vegetable scale of the internal growth) and was, in fact, attached to my left ovary. The ultrasound scan had recorded the results of it being squashed around the front of my lower abdomen. Endometriosis is an often painful condition in which bits of the womb's lining, the endometrium, migrate to other areas of the body and become inflamed. Ovarian cysts and endometriosis are often spoken of in the same breath, partly because the latter condition can give rise to \"chocolate\" cysts, so called because they contain old, thick blood. I was surprised when my consultant told me he had also removed one of these chocolate cysts. I had never had the pain or any other symptom connected with endometriosis, and how much room is there on one ovary anyway, for heaven's sake? It's only the size of a walnut. My surgeon painstakingly removed both cysts and then sewed the ovary back together. Another doctor, present during the operation, even stayed behind after the usual morning doctors' round to tell me the procedure had been \"amazingly intricate and beautiful to watch\". After that, the influx of drugs was relentless. As well as the daily painful injection into my thigh of a blood-thinning agent to reduce the risk of thrombosis, there were oral painkillers and anti-inflammatories dished out by the night nurse. The final - and biggest - drug hurdle was the hormone medication commonly used to suppress ovulation in order to give the reproductive system time to recover from surgery. I found it annoying to be asked every morning by an intimidating gaggle of medics whether I had made up my mind about taking it while still decidedly non compos mentis. On one occasion my insistence that I didn't like taking drugs was met with the assertion that, in that case, I could be given a one-off injection that would last three months. These drugs prompt a \"mini-menopause\" and possible side effects include loss of bone density, hot flushes, vaginal dryness, headaches. A doctor agreed with my observation that whatever benefits this drug brought were purely temporary and that if my body was determined to produce another cyst it would do so as soon as the medication stopped. I declined to take it. Other doctors I spoke to said they doubted the benefits of medication that deactivated the ovaries, and one told me that some women can develop simple cysts while taking the pill. This settled, I just wanted to get well enough to go home. For the first few days of my week in hospital, visits to the loo were nerve-racking. I felt any \"straining\" would split my belly open like a ripe watermelon, even though the suture holding together my hip-to-hip wound made me think of a piece of cable from San Fransisco's Golden Gate Bridge, and a nurse assured me that more layers of stitching secured me inside. My stomach ached constantly and I didn't sleep for three days. Finally, one of the night nurses gently ordered me to swallow a sleeping pill to give my body a chance to rest and heal. Seven days after the operation my brother arrived to take me home. Six months on, I'm still angry at how my body has \"let me down\". And angrier still at a GP who told me, when I queried sharp pains in my ovary, that I'd \"never be the same again\". Still, the ovaries are intact and what I thought would be a scar for life across my stomach has all but disappeared. I'm amazed at how the human body can bounce back from physical trauma. I just hope I'm not one of the unlucky few for whom ovarian cysts recur. I don't want to have to bounce back twice. Ovarian cysts: the facts Simple or \"functional\" ovarian cysts are fluid-filled blister-like growths on an ovary. Few are cancerous and doctors tend to take a \"watch and see\" approach to treatment. Functional cysts tend to appear if the ovary produces too much oestrogen. Although common, especially in young women, they are usually small and disappear on their own in about three months. Most will cause no symptoms: you will feel nothing and probably never know you have a cyst. But some functional cysts do grow large enough to cause problems. Symptoms may include a dull ache, bloating, pain during sex and irregular or painful periods. If a large cyst breaks open, it can cause severe pain and swelling in the lower belly. The pill may help, but in extreme cases, when the cyst has grown larger than a tennis ball, surgery may be necessary. Functional cysts are different from those associated with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a hormonal condition thought to affect up to one in 10 women. Polycystic ovaries have a string of cysts around them (in what is often described as \"a pearl necklace effect\"). PCOS often goes undiagnosed because the symptoms are similar to those of premenstrual tension: weight gain, spots, tiredness, breast pain and depression. But the condition can also cause excess body hair and infertility. The treatment - generally involving hormone pills - will depend on whether or not you are trying to get pregnant.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>'Hop in,' she said.</p> <p>'Cheers,' he said breezily as he swung into the passenger seat.</p> <p>Just from that one word, delivered without a smile despite the smiley facial muscles involved, Isserley already knew something about him. He was the type who needed to swerve round the saying of thanks, as if gratitude were a trap. In his world, there was nothing Isserley could do for him that would put him in her debt; everything was only natural. She had stopped to pick him up off the side of the road; fine. Why not? She was giving him, for free, something a taxi would have charged him a fortune for, and what he said to that was 'Cheers', as if she were a drinking pal and had just done him a trifling, perfunctory favour like sliding an ashtray into his reach.</p> <p>'No problem,' responded Isserley, as if he'd thanked her anyway. 'Where are you heading?'</p> <p>'South,' he said, looking south.</p> <p>A long second idled by, then he pulled the seatbelt across his torso as if reluctantly conceding this was the only way to get the two of them moving.</p> <p>'Just south?' she enquired as she eased the car away from the kerb, careful, as always, to flip the toggle for the indicators rather than the headlights or the windscreen wipers or the icpathua.</p> <p>'Well . . . it depends,' he said. 'Where are you heading?'</p> <p>She made a calculation in her head, then looked at his face to judge where he might figure in it.</p> <p>'I haven't decided yet,' she said. 'Inverness, to begin with.'</p> <p>'Inverness is fine with me.'</p> <p>'But you'd like to go further?'</p> <p>'I'll go as far as I can get.'</p> <p>Another car had appeared suddenly in her rear-view mirror and she had to gauge its intentions; by the time she was able to turn back to the hitcher his face was impassive. Had his remark been impish arrogance? Sexual innuendo? Or just dull matter-of-fact?</p> <p>'Waiting long?' she asked, to tease out more of his wit.</p> <p>'Pardon?'</p> <p>He blinked at her, interrupted in the act of unzipping his jacket. Was the challenge of pulling a zip and simultaneously listening to a simple question more than his intellect could manage? He had a thin black scab etched across his right eyebrow, almost healed - a drunken fall maybe? The whites of his eyes were clear, his hair had been washed in the not too distant past, he didn't smell - was he just stupid?</p> <p>'Where I picked you up,' she elaborated. 'Had you been standing there long?'</p> <p>'I don't know,' he said. 'I don't have a watch.'</p> <p>She glanced down at his nearest wrist; it was big, with fine golden hairs, and two blueish veins passing over onto the backs of his hands.</p> <p>'Well, did it feel long?'</p> <p>He seemed to think this over for a moment.</p> <p>'Yeah.'</p> <p>He grinned. His teeth weren't so good.</p> <p>In the world outside, the sun's rays intensified abruptly as if some responsible agency had just noticed they were shining at half the recommended power. The windscreen lit up like a lamp and beamed ultraviolet rays onto Isserley and the hitcher, pure heat with the nip of breeze neatly filtered out. The car's heater was on full as well, so the hitcher was soon squirming in his seat, taking his jacket off altogether. Isserley watched him surreptitiously, watched the mechanics of his biceps and triceps, the roll of his shoulders.</p> <p>'OK if I put this on the back seat?' he presumed, bundling the jacket up in his big hands.</p> <p>'Sure,' she said, noting the ripples of muscle momentarily expressing themselves through his T-shirt as he twisted round to toss the jacket on top of her own. His abdomen was a bit fatty - beer, not muscle - but nothing too gross. The bulge in his jeans was promising, although most of it was probably testicles.</p> <p>Comfortable now, he settled back in his seat and flashed her a smile seasoned by a lifetime of foul Scottish fodder.</p> <p>She smiled back, wondering how much the teeth really mattered.</p> <p>She could sense herself moving closer to deciding. In fact, to be honest, she was more than half-way already, and her breathing was quickening.</p> <p>She made an effort to forestall the adrenaline as it leaked from her glands, by sending calming messages into herself, swallowing them down. All right, yes, he was good: all right, yes, she wanted him: but she must know a little more about him first. She must avoid the humiliation of committing herself, of allowing herself to believe he would be coming with her, and then finding out he had a wife or a girlfriend waiting.</p> <p>If only he would make some conversation. Why was it always the desirable ones that sat in silence, and the misshapen rejects that prattled away unprompted? She'd had one miserable creature who'd removed a voluminous parka to reveal spindly arms and a pigeon chest: within minutes he was telling her his whole life's story. The brawny ones were more likely to stare into space, or make pronouncements about the world in general, deflecting personal questions with the reflex skill of athletes.</p> <p>Minutes flashed by and her hitcher seemed content to say nothing. Yet at least he was taking the trouble to peek at her body - in particular at her breasts. In fact, as far as she could tell from glancing sideways and meeting his own furtive eyes, he was keen for her to face front so he could ogle her undetected. OK, then: she would let him have a good stare, to see what difference it might make. The Evanton turn-off was coming soon, anyhow, and she needed to concentrate on her driving. She craned forward a little, exaggerating her concentration on the road, and allowed herself to be examined in earnest.</p> <p>Immediately she felt his gaze beaming all over her like another kind of ultraviolet ray, and no less intense.</p> <p>Isserley wondered, oh how she wondered, what she looked like to him, in his alien innocence. Did he notice the trouble she had gone to for him? She straightened her back against the seat, pushing her chest out.</p> <p>The hitcher noticed all right.</p> <p>Fantastic tits on this one, but God, there wasn't much of her otherwise. Tiny - like a kid peering up over the steering wheel. How tall would she be? Five foot one, maybe, standing up. Funny how a lot of women with the best tits were really really short. This girl obviously knew she had a couple of ripe ones, the way she had them sitting pretty on the scoop of a low-cut top. That's why this car was heated like an oven, of course: so she could wear a skimpy black top and air her boobs for all to see - for him to see.</p> <p>The rest of her was a funny shape, though. Long skinny arms with big knobbly elbows - no wonder her top was long sleeved. Knobbly wrists too, and big hands. Still, with tits like that . . .</p> <p>They were really odd, actually, those hands. Bigger than you'd think they'd be, to look at the rest of her, but narrow too, like . . . chicken feet. And tough, like she'd done hard labour with them, maybe worked in a factory. He couldn't see her legs properly, she was wearing those horrible flared seventies trousers that were back in fashion - shiny green, for Christ's sake - and what looked like Doc Martens, but there was no disguising how short her legs were. Still, those tits . . . They were like . . . they were like . . . He didn't know what to compare them to. They looked pretty fucking good, nestled next to one another there, with the sun shining on them through the windscreen.</p> <p>Never mind the tits, though: what about the face? Well, he couldn't see it just now; she had to actually turn towards him for him to see it, because of her haircut. She had thick, fluffy hair, mouse-brown, hanging down straight so he couldn't even see her cheeks when she was facing front. It was tempting to imagine a beautiful face hidden behind that hair, a face like a pop singer or an actress, but he knew different. In fact, when she'd turned towards him, her face had kind of shocked him. It was small and heart-shaped, like an elf in a kiddie's book, with a perfect little nose and a fantastic big-lipped curvy mouth like a supermodel. But she had puffy cheeks and was also wearing the thickest glasses he'd seen in his life: they magnified her eyes so much they looked about twice normal size.</p> <p>She was a weird one all right. Half Baywatch babe, half little old lady.</p> <p>She drove like a little old lady. Fifty miles an hour, absolute max. And that shoddy old anorak of hers on the back seat - what was that all about? She had a screw loose, probably. Nutter, probably. And she talked funny - foreign, definitely.</p> <p>Would he like to fuck her?</p> <p>Probably, if he got the chance. She'd probably be a much better fuck than Janine, that was for sure.</p> <p>Janine. Christ, it was amazing how just thinking of her could bring him right down. He'd been in a great mood until now. Good old Janine. If ever your spirits are getting too up, just think of Janine. Jesus . . . couldn't he just forget it? Just look at this girl's tits, blazing in the sun, like . . . He knew what they looked like now: they looked like the moon. Well, two moons.</p> <p>'So, what are you doing in Inverness?' he said suddenly.</p> <p>'Business,' she said.</p> <p>'What do you do?'</p> <p>Isserley thought for a moment. It was so long since anything had been said, she'd forgotten what she'd decided to be this time.</p> <p>'I'm a lawyer.'</p> <p>'No kidding?'</p> <p>'No kidding.'</p> <p>'Like on TV?'</p> <p>'I don't watch TV.' This was true, more or less. She'd watched it almost constantly when she'd first come to - Scotland, but nowadays she only watched the news and occasionally a snatch of whatever happened to be on while she was exercising.</p> <p>'Criminal cases?' he suggested.</p> <p>She looked him briefly in the eyes. There was a spark there that might be worth fanning.</p> <p>'Sometimes,' she shrugged. Or tried to. Shrugging while driving was a surprisingly difficult physical trick, especially with breasts like hers.</p> <p>'Anything juicy?' he pushed.</p> <p>She squinted into her rear-view mirror, slowing the car to allow a Volkswagen pulling a caravan to overtake.</p> <p>'What would you think was juicy?' she enquired as the manoeuvre slipped gently into place.</p> <p>'I don't know . . .' he sighed, sounding doleful and playful at the same time. 'A man kills his wife 'cause she's playing around with another guy.'</p> <p>'I may have had one of those,' Isserley said noncommittally.</p> <p>'And did you nail him?'</p> <p>'Nail him?'</p> <p>'Did you get him sent down for life?'</p> <p>'What makes you think I wouldn't be defending him?' she smirked.</p> <p>'Oh, you know: women together against men.'</p> <p>His tone had grown distinctly odd: despondent, even bitter, and yet flirtatious. She had to think hard how best to respond.</p> <p>'Oh, I'm not against men,' she said at last, changing lanes reflectively. 'Especially men who get a raw deal from their women.'</p> <p>She hoped that would open him up.</p> <p>But instead he was silent and slumped a little in his seat. She looked aside at him, but he didn't allow eye contact, as if she'd failed to respect some limit. She settled for reading the inscription on his T-shirt. AC/DC, it said, and in large embossed letters, BALLBREAKER. She had no idea what on earth this might mean, and felt suddenly out of her depth with him.</p> <p>Experience had taught her there was nothing to do about that but try to go deeper.</p> <p>'Are you married?' she asked.</p> <p>'Was,' he stated flatly. Sweat was glistening beneath the hairline of his big prickly head; he ran his thumb under the seatbelt as if it were smothering him.</p> <p>'You won't be so keen on lawyers, then,' she suggested.</p> <p>'It was OK,' he said. 'Clean break.'</p> <p>'No children, then?'</p> <p>'She got 'em. Good luck to her.' He said this as if his wife were a distant and repugnant country on which there was no point trying to impose the customs of a more civilized society.</p> <p>'I didn't mean to pry,' said Isserley.</p> <p>'S'alright.'</p> <p>They drove on.

      "bodyText": "'Hop in,' she said. 'Cheers,' he said breezily as he swung into the passenger seat. Just from that one word, delivered without a smile despite the smiley facial muscles involved, Isserley already knew something about him. He was the type who needed to swerve round the saying of thanks, as if gratitude were a trap. In his world, there was nothing Isserley could do for him that would put him in her debt; everything was only natural. She had stopped to pick him up off the side of the road; fine. Why not? She was giving him, for free, something a taxi would have charged him a fortune for, and what he said to that was 'Cheers', as if she were a drinking pal and had just done him a trifling, perfunctory favour like sliding an ashtray into his reach. 'No problem,' responded Isserley, as if he'd thanked her anyway. 'Where are you heading?' 'South,' he said, looking south. A long second idled by, then he pulled the seatbelt across his torso as if reluctantly conceding this was the only way to get the two of them moving. 'Just south?' she enquired as she eased the car away from the kerb, careful, as always, to flip the toggle for the indicators rather than the headlights or the windscreen wipers or the icpathua. 'Well . . . it depends,' he said. 'Where are you heading?' She made a calculation in her head, then looked at his face to judge where he might figure in it. 'I haven't decided yet,' she said. 'Inverness, to begin with.' 'Inverness is fine with me.' 'But you'd like to go further?' 'I'll go as far as I can get.' Another car had appeared suddenly in her rear-view mirror and she had to gauge its intentions; by the time she was able to turn back to the hitcher his face was impassive. Had his remark been impish arrogance? Sexual innuendo? Or just dull matter-of-fact? 'Waiting long?' she asked, to tease out more of his wit. 'Pardon?' He blinked at her, interrupted in the act of unzipping his jacket. Was the challenge of pulling a zip and simultaneously listening to a simple question more than his intellect could manage? He had a thin black scab etched across his right eyebrow, almost healed - a drunken fall maybe? The whites of his eyes were clear, his hair had been washed in the not too distant past, he didn't smell - was he just stupid? 'Where I picked you up,' she elaborated. 'Had you been standing there long?' 'I don't know,' he said. 'I don't have a watch.' She glanced down at his nearest wrist; it was big, with fine golden hairs, and two blueish veins passing over onto the backs of his hands. 'Well, did it feel long?' He seemed to think this over for a moment. 'Yeah.' He grinned. His teeth weren't so good. In the world outside, the sun's rays intensified abruptly as if some responsible agency had just noticed they were shining at half the recommended power. The windscreen lit up like a lamp and beamed ultraviolet rays onto Isserley and the hitcher, pure heat with the nip of breeze neatly filtered out. The car's heater was on full as well, so the hitcher was soon squirming in his seat, taking his jacket off altogether. Isserley watched him surreptitiously, watched the mechanics of his biceps and triceps, the roll of his shoulders. 'OK if I put this on the back seat?' he presumed, bundling the jacket up in his big hands. 'Sure,' she said, noting the ripples of muscle momentarily expressing themselves through his T-shirt as he twisted round to toss the jacket on top of her own. His abdomen was a bit fatty - beer, not muscle - but nothing too gross. The bulge in his jeans was promising, although most of it was probably testicles. Comfortable now, he settled back in his seat and flashed her a smile seasoned by a lifetime of foul Scottish fodder. She smiled back, wondering how much the teeth really mattered. She could sense herself moving closer to deciding. In fact, to be honest, she was more than half-way already, and her breathing was quickening. She made an effort to forestall the adrenaline as it leaked from her glands, by sending calming messages into herself, swallowing them down. All right, yes, he was good: all right, yes, she wanted him: but she must know a little more about him first. She must avoid the humiliation of committing herself, of allowing herself to believe he would be coming with her, and then finding out he had a wife or a girlfriend waiting. If only he would make some conversation. Why was it always the desirable ones that sat in silence, and the misshapen rejects that prattled away unprompted? She'd had one miserable creature who'd removed a voluminous parka to reveal spindly arms and a pigeon chest: within minutes he was telling her his whole life's story. The brawny ones were more likely to stare into space, or make pronouncements about the world in general, deflecting personal questions with the reflex skill of athletes. Minutes flashed by and her hitcher seemed content to say nothing. Yet at least he was taking the trouble to peek at her body - in particular at her breasts. In fact, as far as she could tell from glancing sideways and meeting his own furtive eyes, he was keen for her to face front so he could ogle her undetected. OK, then: she would let him have a good stare, to see what difference it might make. The Evanton turn-off was coming soon, anyhow, and she needed to concentrate on her driving.

      "body": "<p>Tony Blair today condemned the May Day protests against global capitalism as mainstream politicians attempted to discredit independent mayoral candidate Ken Livingstone by associating him with the violence.</p> <p>Mr Blair hinted that the government would reconsider its approach to policing such demonstrations in the future, after police were criticised in some newspapers for not intervening to stop demonstrators removing grass from Parliament Square and defacing monuments. Ninety-five people were arrested in yesterday's demonstrations in London.</p> <p>Metropolitan police deputy assistant commissioner Mike Todd praised the biggest police operation in central London for 30 years, for handling the riots \"in a professional proportionate manner\" despite putting up with \"enormous provocation from a small minority of protesters\".</p> <p>On a visit to a Slough hospital, the prime minister declared he was \"appalled\" by events at yesterday's demonstrations.</p> <p>\"There's a long tradition that people in this country are entitled to demonstrate lawfully, but that right should not be abused in this way,\" he said. \"This kind of thing cannot happen again. There is a right to demonstrate, but responsibly and within the law.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, other politicians sought to tar runaway London mayoral favourite Ken Livingstone with the rioters' brush.</p> <p>Frank Dobson, Labour's mayoral candidate, accused Mr Livingstone of encouraging direct action and claimed the riots confirmed that he was \"unfit to be mayor of London\".</p> <p>\"Yesterday rioters who believe in direct action smashed up property, put working people in fear of their lives, assaulted the police and defiled the Cenotaph,\" Mr Dobson said.</p> <p>\"The police had the difficult and dangerous task of containing this outrageous behaviour. They are entitled to be sure that if they have to do this in future they will have the full and wholehearted support of the mayor of London.

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair today condemned the May Day protests against global capitalism as mainstream politicians attempted to discredit independent mayoral candidate Ken Livingstone by associating him with the violence. Mr Blair hinted that the government would reconsider its approach to policing such demonstrations in the future, after police were criticised in some newspapers for not intervening to stop demonstrators removing grass from Parliament Square and defacing monuments. Ninety-five people were arrested in yesterday's demonstrations in London. Metropolitan police deputy assistant commissioner Mike Todd praised the biggest police operation in central London for 30 years, for handling the riots \"in a professional proportionate manner\" despite putting up with \"enormous provocation from a small minority of protesters\". On a visit to a Slough hospital, the prime minister declared he was \"appalled\" by events at yesterday's demonstrations. \"There's a long tradition that people in this country are entitled to demonstrate lawfully, but that right should not be abused in this way,\" he said. \"This kind of thing cannot happen again. There is a right to demonstrate, but responsibly and within the law.\" Meanwhile, other politicians sought to tar runaway London mayoral favourite Ken Livingstone with the rioters' brush. Frank Dobson, Labour's mayoral candidate, accused Mr Livingstone of encouraging direct action and claimed the riots confirmed that he was \"unfit to be mayor of London\". \"Yesterday rioters who believe in direct action smashed up property, put working people in fear of their lives, assaulted the police and defiled the Cenotaph,\" Mr Dobson said. \"The police had the difficult and dangerous task of containing this outrageous behaviour. They are entitled to be sure that if they have to do this in future they will have the full and wholehearted support of the mayor of London. They have it from me.\" He added: \"If Ken Livingstone were mayor, the police and Londoners would not be sure whose side he would be on. That is because they know what he has said. The rioters know what he has said and they cannot have failed to have been encouraged to think that he was really with them.\" Mr Livingstone attracted controversy in a magazine interview earlier this year in which he claimed he had \"always been in favour of direct action\". He later defended his comments by arguing that \"you won't find a single time when I've ever supported violence\" in the last 20 years. The independent candidate kept a low profile yesterday, issuing an advance copy of a speech outlining his pro-business credentials which he will deliver to a City award ceremony tonight. Conservative leader William Hague and the Liberal Democrats joined the criticism linking Mr Livingstone to yesterday's riots. Mr Hague said the violence showed why voters should not support Mr Livingstone, \"whose heart of hearts is with the rioters not the police\". \"This is what we are going to have if we have Ken Livingstone as mayor and the alternative to that, the only credible alternative, is Steve Norris,\" he told the Today programme. Liberal Democrat candidate Susan Kramer said yesterday's riots were \"yet another wake-up call to London\" about the dangers of a Livingstone mayoralty. \"Ken has made it clear he supports direct action and yesterday he got direct action,\" she told a news conference. \"If you want to protest in this city you can, but violence is not acceptable. If you have the kind of leadership Ken offers, in a way you have given a nod to this, to say this is a city where anarchy can get a warm reception.\" Mr Livingstone though issued a statement praising the police for their handling of yesterday's events. He said: \"Throughout the four days the police thereby set the tone that London both upholds the right to peacefully demonstrate and that it will clamp down with the full force of the law on those who threaten mayhem in the capital. \"This is precisely the tone that should be set for policing in London.

      "body": "<p>In Parliament Square, there was nobody on the grass as the big clock struck 10.30. The guerrilla gardening was due to start, but decorum still kept hundreds of people to the paved edges of the target zone. A very British sight. An hour later, a couple of thousand had gathered, muddying up the turf. A bit of symbolic planting began, followed by the relaying of some sods on the car-infested tarmac. These seemed nice people, herbivores to a man and woman, seasoned by a few dressy exhibitionists. They didn't threaten anybody, least of all the bastions of British politics or capitalism.</p> <p>They were caught both ways. They were always going to be either ridiculed or hated. More likely the former. Be violent, and you get noticed. Be peaceful, and be patronised or ignored. As many knowledgeable observers predicted, a minority of May Day exploiters were bent on violence. They duly carried out their assaults on McDonald's, beating up some bits of central London despite a police presence so massive that it acted as a challenge to the anarchist hard core, which swiftly succeeded in breaching the uniformed cohorts. This wasn't wanted by the herbivores, many of whom, suspecting it was coming, apparently stayed away. But it makes one think a little harder about their hopeless way of taking on the system.</p> <p>Reclaim the Streets, the herbivores in question, is proud to be a \"non-hierarchical, leaderless, openly organised, public group\", in which, according to its website, no individual \"plans or masterminds anything\". Many of its self-directed people are idealists, if not utopians. Most have an environmental agenda, which they believe organised politics is refusing to address. So they make a virtue out of being disorganised. They're proud to be inchoate, delighted to expose opponents who can't handle the fact that a leaderless entity is non-negotiable.</p> <p>But they face enemies who are not inchoate. They're innocents who have been given a profile of menace they do not merit. The state and the corporations can see off events like feel-good occupying and digging without the slightest trouble. The anarchists exploit it as perfect cover for violence that will lose every shred of public sympathy. Meanwhile, some crippling defects in the British system of politics and power are stubbornly unaddressed, and will remain so as long as the shambles that took place yesterday is held to be state-of-the-art rebellion, the last word in revolutionary democracy.</p> <p>No mainstream party dares have a truly radical idea about any environmental question. All confine themselves within a frightened consensus that refuses to challenge the philosophy of economic growth, however it touches on the non-economic aspects of society. None is capable of applying to the future of traffic a creativity that measures up to the coming crisis. But then nor does RTS, for whom the sincere, even romantic lunge, despairing of conventional politics, is supposed to make a decisive statement. A more serious political radicalism would engage with the economic complexities, and find a better way of pressing the case than supplying a backdrop for anarchist destruction.</p> <p>More glaring is the absence of a coherent political challenge to large corporations. Corporate power is the prime beneficiary of Labour's evolution into a party of capitalism. A necessary development, perhaps. But its place of reverence in the British scheme of things was more awesomely asserted last week, when the chairman of BP, Sir John Browne, was permitted to deliver one of the Reith lectures. These used to be the apex of the BBC's contribution to serious British life, an occasion for original thesis-building to challenge received opinion. How far have we sunk that a corporate boss should be offered the assignment to talk about global environmental challenges, which he duly seized for his company, providing no insight that was other than self-serving and no research that did not originate in BP propaganda.</p> <p>No part of the political system contests such degeneration. Yet corporations are not popular. Their judgment of self-interest seldom extends to making people approve. Barclays Bank may be an extreme case, but its recent conduct revealed an indifference to public concerns which showed, more luridly than any recent episode, what corporate power will do when its short-term financial interest is threatened. Barclays' mix of brutality and complacency over branch closures could not, you might have thought, be surpassed - until you heard its chief executive's seigneurially contemptuous response to any notion that his \u00a35m personal package might be open to debate.</p> <p>Such attitudes do not attract public support. Yet few elected politicians are prepared to attack them. Like democracy, capitalism, for all its defects, is the best system anyone can think of. But it needs constant criticism. And the downside of capitalism and its perversions has no spokesman. A gap in the political market opens up. Segments of the electorate await it. There's space for forceful attack, rooted in ideas not gestures.</p> <p>The political system does respond to force. Arguably it responds to nothing else. Not violence, which is easily seen off by the superior violence of the state, but the force of a competing political reality which threatens the power of those who control the system. The herbivore world itself has sometimes proved this. Targeted campaigns, based on rational arguments, diligent planning and accountable leadership, have changed the political and economic landscape.</p> <p>No more major bypasses will be built in a hurry, after the trouble direct action caused at Newbury and the fulfilment of the protesters' predictions that the bypass would merely relocate congestion. Though ministers won't admit it, past protest has shifted the limits of future policy. It did more with Monsanto and its terminator seeds, which aspired to change modern agriculture. Consumer resistance, marshalled and informed by campaigns of popular protest, put paid to a product which Monsanto expended vast sums on developing and trying to push through.</p> <p>Seattle and Washington, from which the London event was supposed to be drawing inspiration, connected with a different sort of reality. Much to the herbivores' distress, violence was not absent from the efforts to disrupt the meetings of the World Trade Organisation and International Monetary Fund.

      "bodyText": "In Parliament Square, there was nobody on the grass as the big clock struck 10.30. The guerrilla gardening was due to start, but decorum still kept hundreds of people to the paved edges of the target zone. A very British sight. An hour later, a couple of thousand had gathered, muddying up the turf. A bit of symbolic planting began, followed by the relaying of some sods on the car-infested tarmac. These seemed nice people, herbivores to a man and woman, seasoned by a few dressy exhibitionists. They didn't threaten anybody, least of all the bastions of British politics or capitalism. They were caught both ways. They were always going to be either ridiculed or hated. More likely the former. Be violent, and you get noticed. Be peaceful, and be patronised or ignored. As many knowledgeable observers predicted, a minority of May Day exploiters were bent on violence. They duly carried out their assaults on McDonald's, beating up some bits of central London despite a police presence so massive that it acted as a challenge to the anarchist hard core, which swiftly succeeded in breaching the uniformed cohorts. This wasn't wanted by the herbivores, many of whom, suspecting it was coming, apparently stayed away. But it makes one think a little harder about their hopeless way of taking on the system. Reclaim the Streets, the herbivores in question, is proud to be a \"non-hierarchical, leaderless, openly organised, public group\", in which, according to its website, no individual \"plans or masterminds anything\". Many of its self-directed people are idealists, if not utopians. Most have an environmental agenda, which they believe organised politics is refusing to address. So they make a virtue out of being disorganised. They're proud to be inchoate, delighted to expose opponents who can't handle the fact that a leaderless entity is non-negotiable. But they face enemies who are not inchoate. They're innocents who have been given a profile of menace they do not merit. The state and the corporations can see off events like feel-good occupying and digging without the slightest trouble. The anarchists exploit it as perfect cover for violence that will lose every shred of public sympathy. Meanwhile, some crippling defects in the British system of politics and power are stubbornly unaddressed, and will remain so as long as the shambles that took place yesterday is held to be state-of-the-art rebellion, the last word in revolutionary democracy. No mainstream party dares have a truly radical idea about any environmental question. All confine themselves within a frightened consensus that refuses to challenge the philosophy of economic growth, however it touches on the non-economic aspects of society. None is capable of applying to the future of traffic a creativity that measures up to the coming crisis. But then nor does RTS, for whom the sincere, even romantic lunge, despairing of conventional politics, is supposed to make a decisive statement. A more serious political radicalism would engage with the economic complexities, and find a better way of pressing the case than supplying a backdrop for anarchist destruction. More glaring is the absence of a coherent political challenge to large corporations. Corporate power is the prime beneficiary of Labour's evolution into a party of capitalism. A necessary development, perhaps. But its place of reverence in the British scheme of things was more awesomely asserted last week, when the chairman of BP, Sir John Browne, was permitted to deliver one of the Reith lectures. These used to be the apex of the BBC's contribution to serious British life, an occasion for original thesis-building to challenge received opinion. How far have we sunk that a corporate boss should be offered the assignment to talk about global environmental challenges, which he duly seized for his company, providing no insight that was other than self-serving and no research that did not originate in BP propaganda. No part of the political system contests such degeneration. Yet corporations are not popular. Their judgment of self-interest seldom extends to making people approve. Barclays Bank may be an extreme case, but its recent conduct revealed an indifference to public concerns which showed, more luridly than any recent episode, what corporate power will do when its short-term financial interest is threatened. Barclays' mix of brutality and complacency over branch closures could not, you might have thought, be surpassed - until you heard its chief executive's seigneurially contemptuous response to any notion that his \u00a35m personal package might be open to debate. Such attitudes do not attract public support. Yet few elected politicians are prepared to attack them. Like democracy, capitalism, for all its defects, is the best system anyone can think of. But it needs constant criticism. And the downside of capitalism and its perversions has no spokesman. A gap in the political market opens up. Segments of the electorate await it. There's space for forceful attack, rooted in ideas not gestures. The political system does respond to force. Arguably it responds to nothing else. Not violence, which is easily seen off by the superior violence of the state, but the force of a competing political reality which threatens the power of those who control the system. The herbivore world itself has sometimes proved this. Targeted campaigns, based on rational arguments, diligent planning and accountable leadership, have changed the political and economic landscape. No more major bypasses will be built in a hurry, after the trouble direct action caused at Newbury and the fulfilment of the protesters' predictions that the bypass would merely relocate congestion. Though ministers won't admit it, past protest has shifted the limits of future policy. It did more with Monsanto and its terminator seeds, which aspired to change modern agriculture. Consumer resistance, marshalled and informed by campaigns of popular protest, put paid to a product which Monsanto expended vast sums on developing and trying to push through. Seattle and Washington, from which the London event was supposed to be drawing inspiration, connected with a different sort of reality. Much to the herbivores' distress, violence was not absent from the efforts to disrupt the meetings of the World Trade Organisation and International Monetary Fund. But Seattle worked by amplifying real political forces already at large, especially in the third world. Direct action was the ally not the enemy of political reality. Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth try to do the same. In the end, they make their effect by argument and action - very old operating principles - not by a bogus romance with anti-politics. hugoyoung@compuserve.com",

      "bodyText": "When protesters stormed the City of London last June in the first anti-capitalist demonstration the police were out of their depth, an independent review later suggested. Yesterday, they had a point to prove. In June, senior police officers betrayed their inexperience and made errors of judgment as they struggled to deal with a level of violence not seen since the Trafalgar Square poll tax riots of 1990, and security guards at the Liffe building, home of the London futures market, were forced to fight off the activists before the 390 police officers arrived. The clashes injured 44 people - one officer suffering a serious spinal injury - and left a \u00a32m trail of devastation, but the damage to the capital's combined police force was equally severe. The commissioner of the City of London police, which masterminded the response to the June riots, was forced to admit that his officers' handling of the pitched battles inside the Liffe was \"highly unsatisfactory\". Anthony Speed, the retired Metropolitan police assistant commissioner who conducted the review, exposed not only inexperience but lack of communication and confusion between the two forces involved, the Met and the City. This time the Met, together with the British Transport police and the City of London force, was determined to prevent any possible criticism, and to learn from the handling of the June riot and the November 30 demonstration, when rioting at Euston station led to a police van being set on fire and 34 arrests. Scotland Yard cancelled leave for all uniformed officers and allocated 5,500 to deal with the protest, leaving a further 9,000 outside the centre, ready to be diverted from other duties if necessary. More than 100 were scrutinising CCTV pictures and passing on intelligence from a packed operations control room, while photographers were busy gathering evidence on the ground. Army barracks in London were said to be on standby against any intrusion, and security was stepped up at the Millennium Dome, where activists had promised a \"very big surprise\". Despite the vastly increased numbers, the Met was determined to operate a \"softly softly approach\", minimising the police presence and turning a blind eye to minor offences to avoid provoking violence clashes. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Mike Todd told Sky News: \"We have in effect almost allowed minor offences of criminal damage to take place to protect public order. \"We were intending [that] these people were filmed and held accountable at a later date for their actions.\" This approach left uniformed officers standing by as activists dug up the paving stones in Parliament Square and planted seeds as part of a \"guerrilla gardening\" action. The approach foundered once a breakaway group of anarchists began to smash up and loot a branch of McDonald's in Whitehall. Within minutes specially equipped riot police arrived to contend with the flying bottles and bricks. \"We've been forced to change our approach because of the violence,\" a Met spokeswoman admitted. Condemning the McDonald's attack as \"thuggery\", Mr Todd added: \"We tried desperately not to inflame the situation and not have too many officers there, but what we have to do is to regain control of the situation and that's what we've been doing with our officers.\"",

By 2.30pm, 3,000 people were swilling up Whitehall behind a samba band, shaking fists and throwing insults and plastic bottles at Downing Street.

Five vanloads of officers in full riot gear moved in, splitting the crowd. Those to the north of the McDonald's fled towards Trafalgar Square, the rest retreated over the river to Kennington Park. As the police lined across the road, they were attacked by gangs but slowly and relentlessly they pushed the crowd into the sqaure.</p> <p>Skirmishes broke out on the corner of Trafalgar Square and Northumberland Avenue. For the first time, some of the gardeners tried to stop the anarchists. Arguments broke out: \"Plant your fucking veggies, fucking hippies, see what that'll do.\" \"Idiots,\" countered the dirty-handed ones. \"You won't change anything with violence.\" Others in masks tried to stop people attacking the police: \"They're just the monkeys. Kill the sheriff, not his deputies.\" Meanwhile others sat down in front of the police, and bantered with them.</p> <p>All roads into Trafalgar Square had now been closed by double or triple lines of riot police, leaving several thousand bemused tourists. \"What is happening?\" asked a Japanese mother, feeding grain to the pigeons. \"Don't worry ma'am,\" said one man. \"We're just overthrowing the state\". \"I see,\" replied the woman.</p> <p>By now Nelson's Column was a sea of banners and groups, stacked with Kurds, Maoists, anarchists, socialists, ecologists, situationists, guerrilla gardeners and not a few tourists lining up as if for a school photograph of apprentice dissenters. Flowers adorned the lions, with stickers and banners on the railings reading \"Reinvent democracy,\" \"Blair, we won't go away\", and \"Queen Mum drop dead.\"</p> <p>In front of the column, Bill, a \"freelance\" from Peckham, had gathered all the socialist and Marxist literature that he could find and set fire to it, to cheers. \"It's just boring politics,\" he says. \"I'm just into thinking for myself.\"</p> <p>By early evening, the party was effectively over, with people drifting into streets that for once were without cars. \"I love London,\" said Manuel, a Peruvian sitting on the steps of St Martin's in the Fields. \"Compared to South America it is so ... calm.\"</p>",

Those to the north of the McDonald's fled towards Trafalgar Square, the rest retreated over the river to Kennington Park. As the police lined across the road, they were attacked by gangs but slowly and relentlessly they pushed the crowd into the sqaure. Skirmishes broke out on the corner of Trafalgar Square and Northumberland Avenue. For the first time, some of the gardeners tried to stop the anarchists. Arguments broke out: \"Plant your fucking veggies, fucking hippies, see what that'll do.\" \"Idiots,\" countered the dirty-handed ones. \"You won't change anything with violence.\" Others in masks tried to stop people attacking the police: \"They're just the monkeys. Kill the sheriff, not his deputies.\" Meanwhile others sat down in front of the police, and bantered with them. All roads into Trafalgar Square had now been closed by double or triple lines of riot police, leaving several thousand bemused tourists. \"What is happening?\" asked a Japanese mother, feeding grain to the pigeons. \"Don't worry ma'am,\" said one man. \"We're just overthrowing the state\". \"I see,\" replied the woman. By now Nelson's Column was a sea of banners and groups, stacked with Kurds, Maoists, anarchists, socialists, ecologists, situationists, guerrilla gardeners and not a few tourists lining up as if for a school photograph of apprentice dissenters. Flowers adorned the lions, with stickers and banners on the railings reading \"Reinvent democracy,\" \"Blair, we won't go away\", and \"Queen Mum drop dead.\" In front of the column, Bill, a \"freelance\" from Peckham, had gathered all the socialist and Marxist literature that he could find and set fire to it, to cheers. \"It's just boring politics,\" he says. \"I'm just into thinking for myself.\" By early evening, the party was effectively over, with people drifting into streets that for once were without cars. \"I love London,\" said Manuel, a Peruvian sitting on the steps of St Martin's in the Fields. \"Compared to South America it is so ... calm.\"",

Even in the nacreous hush of a winter dawn, when the mists were still dossed down in the fields on either side, the A9 could not be trusted to stay empty for long. Furry carcasses of unidentifiable forest creatures littered the asphalt, fresh every morning, each of them a frozen moment in time when some living thing had mistaken the road for its natural habitat.</p> <p>Isserley, too, often ventured out at hours of such prehistoric stillness that her vehicle might have been the first ever. It was as if she had been set down on a world so newly finished that the mountains might still have some shifting to do and the wooded valleys might yet be recast as seas.</p> <p>Nevertheless, once she'd launched her little car onto the deserted, faintly steaming road, it was often only a matter of minutes before there was southbound traffic coming up behind her. Nor was this traffic content to let her set the pace, like one sheep following another on a narrow path; she must drive faster, or be hooted off the single carriageway.</p> <p>Also, this being an arterial road, she must be alert to all the little capillary paths joining it. Only a few of the junctions were clearly signposted, as if singled out for this distinction by natural selection; the rest were camouflaged by trees. Ignoring junctions was not a good idea, even though Isserley had the right of way: any one of them could be spring-loaded with an impatiently shuddering tractor which, if it leapt into her path, would hardly suffer for its mistake, while she would be strewn across the bitumen.</p> <p>Most distracting of all, though, was not the threat of danger but the allure of beauty. A luminous moat of rainwater, a swarm of gulls following a seeder around a loamy field, a glimpse of rain two or three mountains away, even a lone oystercatcher flying overhead: any of these could make Isserley half forget what she was on the road for. She would be driving along as the sun rose fully, watching distant farmhouses turn golden, when something much nearer to her, drably shaded, would metamorphose suddenly from a tree-branch or a tangle of debris into a fleshy biped with its arm extended.</p> <p>Then she'd remember, but sometimes not until she was already sweeping by, narrowly missing the tip of the hitcher's hand, as if the fingers might have been snapped off, twig-like, had they grown just a few centimetres longer.</p> <p>Stepping on the brake was out of the question. Instead, she'd leave her foot undisturbed on the accelerator, stay in line with the other cars, and do nothing more than take a mental photograph as she, too, zoomed past.</p> <p>Sometimes, examining this mental image as she drove on, she would note that the hitcher was a female. Isserley wasn't interested in females, at least not in that way. Let them get picked up by someone else.</p> <p>If the hitcher was male, she usually went back for another look, unless he was an obvious weakling. Assuming he'd made a reasonable impression on her, she would execute a U-turn as soon as it was safe to do so - well out of sight, of course: she didn't want him to know she was interested. Then, driving past on the other side of the road, as slowly as traffic allowed, she'd size him up a second time.</p> <p>Very occasionally she would fail to find him again: some other motorist, less cautious or less choosy, must have slewed to a halt and picked him up in the time it had taken her to double back. She would squint at where she thought he'd been standing, and see only a vacant hem of gravel. She'd look beyond the road's edge, at the fields or the undergrowth, in case he was hidden in there somewhere, urinating. (They were prone to do that.) It would seem inconceivable to her that he should be gone so soon; his body had been so good \u00e6 so excellent \u00e6 so perfect \u00e6 why had she thrown away her chance? Why hadn't she just picked him up as soon as she saw him?</p> <p>Sometimes the loss would be so hard to accept that she just kept driving, for miles and miles, hoping that whoever had taken him from her would set him down again. Cows blinked at her innocently as she sped by in a haze of wasted petrol.</p> <p>Usually, however, the hitcher was standing exactly where she'd first passed him, his arm perhaps just marginally less erect, his clothing (if rain was setting in) just that little bit more piebald. Coming from the opposite direction, Isserley might catch a glimpse of his buttocks, or his thighs, or maybe how well-muscled his shoulders were. There was something in the stance, too, that could indicate the cocky self-awareness of a male in prime condition.</p> <p>Driving past, she'd stare straight at him, to verify her first impressions, making totally sure she wasn't pumping him up in her imagination.</p> <p>If he really did make the grade, she stopped the car and took him.</p> <p>Isserley had been doing this for years. Scarcely a day went by when she didn't drive her battered red Toyota Corolla to the A9 and start cruising. Even when she'd had a run of successful encounters and her self-esteem was high, she'd worry that the last hitcher she'd picked up might prove, with hindsight, to be her last truly satisfactory one: perhaps no-one in the future would measure up.</p> <p>In truth, there was for Isserley an addictive thrill about the challenge. She could have some magnificent brute sitting in her car, right next to her, knowing for sure that he was coming home with her, and she could already be thinking ahead to the next one. Even while she was admiring him, following the curves of his brawny shoulders or the swell of his chest under his T-shirt, savouring the thought of how superb he'd be once he was naked, she would keep one eye on the roadside, just in case an even better prospect was beckoning to her out there.</p> <p>Today hadn't started well.</p> <p>Driving the car across the railway overpass near the comatose village of Fearn, before she'd even reached the highway, she became aware of a rattle somewhere above the wheel on the passenger side. She listened to it, holding her breath, wondering what it was trying to tell her in its quaint foreign language. Was the rattle a plea for help? A momentary grumble? A friendly warning? She listened some more, trying to imagine how a car might make itself understood.</p> <p>This red Corolla wasn't the best car she'd ever had; she especially missed the grey Nissan estate she'd learned to drive in. It had responded smoothly and placidly, made almost no noise, and had lots of room in the back - enough to put a bed in, even. But she'd had to dump it, after only a year.</p> <p>Since then, she'd had a couple of vehicles, but they were smaller, and the customized bits, when transplanted from the Nissan, caused trouble. This red Corolla handled stiffly and could be temperamental. No doubt it wanted to be a good car, but it had its problems.</p> <p>Only a few hundred metres short of the junction with the highway, a hairy youngster was ambling along the side of the narrow road, thumbing a lift. She accelerated past him, and he threw up his arm lazily, adding two fingers to the gesture. He knew her face, vaguely, and she knew his, vaguely. They were both locals, though they'd never met except at moments like this.</p> <p>Isserley had a policy of steering well clear of locals.</p> <p>Turning onto the A9 at Kildary, she checked the clock on the dashboard. The days were lengthening fast: only 8:24, and the sun was already off the ground. The sky was bruise blue and flesh pink behind a swaddling of pure white cumulus, hinting at the frigid clarity to come. There would be no snow, but frost would sparkle for hours yet and night would fall well before the air had a chance to get warm.</p> <p>For Isserley's purposes, a clear raw day like this was good for safe driving, but wasn't so good for assessing hitchers. Exceptionally hardy specimens might go short-sleeved, to show off their fitness, but most would be bundled up in overcoats and layers of wool to make things difficult for her. Even a starveling could look musclebound if he had enough gear on.</p> <p>There was no traffic in her rear-view mirror and she gave herself permission to pootle along at 40 miles an hour, partly to test out how the rattle was doing. It seemed to have fixed itself. That was wishful thinking, of course. But it was a cheering thing to think when setting out in the morning, after a night of nagging pain, bad dreams and fitful sleep.</p> <p>She sniffed deeply and laboriously through her narrow, barely patent little nostrils. The air was fresh and sharp, slightly intoxicating, like pure oxygen administered through a mask, or ether. Her consciousness was hesitating at a crossroads between hyperactive wakefulness and a return to sleep. If she didn't get the stimulation of some action soon, she knew which way it was likely to go.</p> <p>Isserley drove past some of the usual spots where hitchers were set down, but there was no-one. Just the road and the wide world, empty.</p> <p>A few stray drops of rain spattered the windscreen, and the wipers smeared two filthy monochrome rainbows across her line of vision. She squirted bottled water from inside the bonnet, a seemingly endless stream of it against the glass, before she was able to get a clear view again. The manoeuvre left her more tired somehow, as if she'd had to give up vital fluids of her own.</p> <p>She tried to project herself forward in time, visualizing herself already parked somewhere with a hunky young hitch-hiker sitting next to her; she imagined herself breathing heavily against him as she smoothed his hair and grasped him round the waist to ease him into position. The fantasy was not enough, however, to keep her eyes from drooping shut.</p> <p>Just as Isserley was considering finding a place to pull in and doze for a while, she spotted a silhouetted figure just below the horizon. Instantly she roused herself and dilated her eyelids attentively, pushing her glasses on straight. She checked her face and hair in the rear-view mirror. Experimentally, she pouted her lips, which were red as lipstick.</p> <p>Driving past the hitcher the first time, she noted he was a male, quite tall, broad-shouldered, casually dressed. He was using both thumb and forefinger, rather slackly, as if he'd been waiting ages. Or maybe he didn't want to appear too eager.</p> <p>On the way back, she noted he was quite young, with a very short haircut in the penal Scottish style. His clothing was drab as mud. What he had inside it filled up his jacket impressively, although whether with muscle or fat remained to be seen.</p> <p>Driving towards him the final time, Isserley realized he really was uncommonly tall. He was staring at her, possibly figuring out that he had already seen her a couple of minutes before, as there wasn't much other traffic. Nevertheless, he didn't beckon to her any more urgently, just kept his hand lazily extended. Begging was not his style.</p> <p>She slowed down and brought her car to a standstill right in front of him.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/firstchapters/story/0,6761,216470,00.html\">Continue</a> </p> <p>Copyright \u00a9 2000 by Michel Faber.

      "bodyText": "Isserley always drove straight past a hitch-hiker when she first saw him, to give herself time to size him up. She was looking for big muscles: a hunk on legs. Puny, scrawny specimens were no use to her. At first glance, though, it could be surprisingly difficult to tell the difference. You'd think a lone hitcher on a country road would stand out a mile, like a distant monument or a grain silo; you'd think you would be able to appraise him calmly as you drove, undress him and turn him over in your mind well in advance. But Isserley had found it didn't happen that way. Driving through the Highlands of Scotland was an absorbing task in itself; there was always more going on than picture postcards allowed. Even in the nacreous hush of a winter dawn, when the mists were still dossed down in the fields on either side, the A9 could not be trusted to stay empty for long. Furry carcasses of unidentifiable forest creatures littered the asphalt, fresh every morning, each of them a frozen moment in time when some living thing had mistaken the road for its natural habitat. Isserley, too, often ventured out at hours of such prehistoric stillness that her vehicle might have been the first ever. It was as if she had been set down on a world so newly finished that the mountains might still have some shifting to do and the wooded valleys might yet be recast as seas. Nevertheless, once she'd launched her little car onto the deserted, faintly steaming road, it was often only a matter of minutes before there was southbound traffic coming up behind her.

Most distracting of all, though, was not the threat of danger but the allure of beauty. A luminous moat of rainwater, a swarm of gulls following a seeder around a loamy field, a glimpse of rain two or three mountains away, even a lone oystercatcher flying overhead: any of these could make Isserley half forget what she was on the road for. She would be driving along as the sun rose fully, watching distant farmhouses turn golden, when something much nearer to her, drably shaded, would metamorphose suddenly from a tree-branch or a tangle of debris into a fleshy biped with its arm extended. Then she'd remember, but sometimes not until she was already sweeping by, narrowly missing the tip of the hitcher's hand, as if the fingers might have been snapped off, twig-like, had they grown just a few centimetres longer. Stepping on the brake was out of the question. Instead, she'd leave her foot undisturbed on the accelerator, stay in line with the other cars, and do nothing more than take a mental photograph as she, too, zoomed past.

Sometimes the loss would be so hard to accept that she just kept driving, for miles and miles, hoping that whoever had taken him from her would set him down again.

      "body": "<p>How do you fall out of love with Elizabeth Taylor? It's not easy. Time should have made a difference. After all, she is nearly 69, with a history of ballooning weight, and looks nothing like her original screen self. Also, as everybody knows, she has been spoilt rotten by film studios and successive husbands. She's got a foul mouth and a fouler temper, and even she admits her films are either \"a piece of shit\" or, like the over-upholstered Cleopatra, so excessive and clunky they made her \"throw up\". In a final blow to any lingering lustre, this year Liz received the matronly accolade of Dame of the British Empire. So why do we forgive her all this and continue to revere her as our queen of the screen? </p> <p>Because she can't act. Her fans may cite Cat on a Hot Tin Roof or Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf as evidence to the contrary, but real lovers of Liz know that while her roles and even her image may change, her performances remain the same. And that goes for the TV films, the studio rubbish and MGM leftovers that litter her career, as well as for the great moments opposite Burton or Brando. That's why we can't stop looking at her - precisely because, like Garbo before her and Monroe, she never becomes the character she's playing. She always remains gloriously herself. </p> <p>\"She never appeared to be acting,\" observed a Picturegoer reporter in 1950, when he visited a 17-year-old Taylor on the Pinewood set of Conspirator, where she was playing her first adult part. \"She always seemed to be natural. I doubt that anyone has taught her how to act or face the camera.\" He was right. Five years earlier, after her first hit for the studio, National Velvet, she had suggested to the dreaded studio boss Louis B Mayer that she take drama classes. \"You're so goddamned stupid,\" he yelled at her. \"Don't come in here and try to tell me how to make a picture.\" \"You and your studio can both go to hell,\" the 12-year-old screamed back. </p> <p>Her mother patched up the row but she never got her acting lessons. \"The atmosphere,\" Liz later remembered, \"was one of tremendous brown-nosing and of a genuine fear that you could smell. Stars at MGM were born or died more or less at the whim of LB Mayer. But I was too young to know why all of a sudden a young woman could be blackballed and never be heard of again.\" Stuck as she was in a revolving seven-year contract, she learned how to put on a courageous face, but not the nuts and bolts of acting. She was rarely given roles that would stretch her instinctive combination of guile and grace. </p> <p>Everything depended on her beauty. The raven hair, the petulant mouth, not to mention what Richard Burton called \"her over-developed chest\"; but most of all, the timeless seduction of those legendary violet eyes. The downside of this unabashed beauty is that it can knock a film off balance, especially when it is allied to her lack of technique. </p> <p>Take the climactic death scene of Ivanhoe, where the Jewish heroine, Rebecca, is being led to the stake. Liz holds her head up. She is serenely proud, but then, as a critic pointed out, she pouts on the pyre \"as though she'd been stood up for a date\". Sometimes her voice will reinforce the inappropriateness of her looks, as it does in Cleopatra when she sees Richard Burton's Mark Antony strolling by and invites him from behind a pillar in pure nasal Californian to, \"C'mon in.\" </p> <p>But she can't be blamed for the way her beauty scuppers Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. She gives her all in the role of Maggie, and that's part of the problem. To see a virile young Newman writhing away from a woman who could raise sap from a petrified tree because he's not \"ready for it\" is a perfect study in disbelief. </p> <p>Yet when Taylor's beauty is allied to a plot, we are made to believe. All of us want Montgomery Clift to get away with murder in A Place in the Sun, not just because his reward - Taylor - is rich and will keep him in style, but because she is so heartachingly unattainable. We believe these beautiful beings deserve each other, even if it means disposing of an inconvenient wife who is plain, pregnant and a social embarrassment. There's an almost physical sense of loss when we realise Clift will never attain these giddy heights of unparalleled beauty, but instead is going to drop through the hangman's trap-door with an image of those wonderful eyes imprinted on his mind. </p> <p>Even the grotesque historical inaccuracies of Cleopatra were almost transcended by the pulling power of Taylor's aura. Who else could have been preceded into imperial Rome by 50 fanfarers mounted on Arabian horses, followed by eight chariots drawn by matching teams, each one accompanied by a bowman shooting multicoloured smoking arrows into the sky, and not be upstaged? And then there are the scantily-clad dancing girls with streamers, the Watusi warriors, the dwarfs tossing sweets from painted donkeys to the 300 sweating Nubian musclemen pulling the three storey-high black-marbled Sphinxmobile, upon which sits our Anglo-Californian Queen of the Nile. At last she descends, lifts her veil and bows to Caesar. For a second there is silence, then pandemonium. Cleopatra has captivated Rome. She looks up to Caesar - and winks. </p> <p>By the time the scene was set up, Liz's affair with Burton had pushed the cold war and the imminent Cuban missile crisis off the front pages, and, then, in the middle of the brouhaha, the Vatican accused her of \"erotic vagrancy\". The terrified actress feared that once her procession got through the Arch of Titus, the 6,000 waiting Roman extras would deliver an impromptu stoning. Instead they cheered and blew kisses. The script may have been Cleopatra's beauty conquering Ancient Rome, but the real triumph was Liz Taylor's. </p> <p>However, her fundamental lack of acting ability has prevented her from ever becoming a middle-aged character actress, and so she has not appeared in what anybody would consider to be a serious film in nearly four decades. In the meantime her over-indulgence in double-chocolate fudge has lead to successive, unsuccessful battles of the bulge and jokes such as Joan River's announcement that Taylor is doing a remake of National Velvet: \"It's called Crushed Velvet.\" Nonetheless, while Liz's fluctuating weight may have made her a (fuller) figure of fun, her battles with double pneumonia and cancer - when she defiantly displayed her bald head - have revealed her vulnerability, and at the same time made her increasingly invulnerable. Added to that, she's raised more than \u00a3100m for HIV and Aids charities. </p> <p>At heart our Liz is a beautiful, brawling survivor, whose vulgarity and excess of appetite have paradoxically enabled us to share the cinema's great age of glamour. Most of the stars had to fight for fame, then they died or withered under the glare. But because Liz never knew anything else, her normal state has always been one of stardom. She was born a child of the studios, but became her own woman. What a dame. </p> <p>\u0095 A season of Elizabeth Taylor films runs till May 28 at the National Film Theatre. Elizabeth Taylor: a Photographic Celebration opens at the National Portrait Gallery on May 18. The Royal Albert Hall Gala for Elizabeth Taylor's Aids Charitable Trust is on May 26.</p>",

      "bodyText": "How do you fall out of love with Elizabeth Taylor? It's not easy. Time should have made a difference. After all, she is nearly 69, with a history of ballooning weight, and looks nothing like her original screen self. Also, as everybody knows, she has been spoilt rotten by film studios and successive husbands. She's got a foul mouth and a fouler temper, and even she admits her films are either \"a piece of shit\" or, like the over-upholstered Cleopatra, so excessive and clunky they made her \"throw up\". In a final blow to any lingering lustre, this year Liz received the matronly accolade of Dame of the British Empire. So why do we forgive her all this and continue to revere her as our queen of the screen? Because she can't act. Her fans may cite Cat on a Hot Tin Roof or Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf as evidence to the contrary, but real lovers of Liz know that while her roles and even her image may change, her performances remain the same. And that goes for the TV films, the studio rubbish and MGM leftovers that litter her career, as well as for the great moments opposite Burton or Brando. That's why we can't stop looking at her - precisely because, like Garbo before her and Monroe, she never becomes the character she's playing. She always remains gloriously herself. \"She never appeared to be acting,\" observed a Picturegoer reporter in 1950, when he visited a 17-year-old Taylor on the Pinewood set of Conspirator, where she was playing her first adult part. \"She always seemed to be natural. I doubt that anyone has taught her how to act or face the camera.\" He was right. Five years earlier, after her first hit for the studio, National Velvet, she had suggested to the dreaded studio boss Louis B Mayer that she take drama classes. \"You're so goddamned stupid,\" he yelled at her. \"Don't come in here and try to tell me how to make a picture.\" \"You and your studio can both go to hell,\" the 12-year-old screamed back. Her mother patched up the row but she never got her acting lessons. \"The atmosphere,\" Liz later remembered, \"was one of tremendous brown-nosing and of a genuine fear that you could smell. Stars at MGM were born or died more or less at the whim of LB Mayer. But I was too young to know why all of a sudden a young woman could be blackballed and never be heard of again.\" Stuck as she was in a revolving seven-year contract, she learned how to put on a courageous face, but not the nuts and bolts of acting. She was rarely given roles that would stretch her instinctive combination of guile and grace. Everything depended on her beauty. The raven hair, the petulant mouth, not to mention what Richard Burton called \"her over-developed chest\"; but most of all, the timeless seduction of those legendary violet eyes. The downside of this unabashed beauty is that it can knock a film off balance, especially when it is allied to her lack of technique. Take the climactic death scene of Ivanhoe, where the Jewish heroine, Rebecca, is being led to the stake. Liz holds her head up. She is serenely proud, but then, as a critic pointed out, she pouts on the pyre \"as though she'd been stood up for a date\". Sometimes her voice will reinforce the inappropriateness of her looks, as it does in Cleopatra when she sees Richard Burton's Mark Antony strolling by and invites him from behind a pillar in pure nasal Californian to, \"C'mon in.\" But she can't be blamed for the way her beauty scuppers Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. She gives her all in the role of Maggie, and that's part of the problem. To see a virile young Newman writhing away from a woman who could raise sap from a petrified tree because he's not \"ready for it\" is a perfect study in disbelief. Yet when Taylor's beauty is allied to a plot, we are made to believe. All of us want Montgomery Clift to get away with murder in A Place in the Sun, not just because his reward - Taylor - is rich and will keep him in style, but because she is so heartachingly unattainable. We believe these beautiful beings deserve each other, even if it means disposing of an inconvenient wife who is plain, pregnant and a social embarrassment. There's an almost physical sense of loss when we realise Clift will never attain these giddy heights of unparalleled beauty, but instead is going to drop through the hangman's trap-door with an image of those wonderful eyes imprinted on his mind. Even the grotesque historical inaccuracies of Cleopatra were almost transcended by the pulling power of Taylor's aura. Who else could have been preceded into imperial Rome by 50 fanfarers mounted on Arabian horses, followed by eight chariots drawn by matching teams, each one accompanied by a bowman shooting multicoloured smoking arrows into the sky, and not be upstaged? And then there are the scantily-clad dancing girls with streamers, the Watusi warriors, the dwarfs tossing sweets from painted donkeys to the 300 sweating Nubian musclemen pulling the three storey-high black-marbled Sphinxmobile, upon which sits our Anglo-Californian Queen of the Nile. At last she descends, lifts her veil and bows to Caesar. For a second there is silence, then pandemonium. Cleopatra has captivated Rome. She looks up to Caesar - and winks. By the time the scene was set up, Liz's affair with Burton had pushed the cold war and the imminent Cuban missile crisis off the front pages, and, then, in the middle of the brouhaha, the Vatican accused her of \"erotic vagrancy\". The terrified actress feared that once her procession got through the Arch of Titus, the 6,000 waiting Roman extras would deliver an impromptu stoning. Instead they cheered and blew kisses. The script may have been Cleopatra's beauty conquering Ancient Rome, but the real triumph was Liz Taylor's. However, her fundamental lack of acting ability has prevented her from ever becoming a middle-aged character actress, and so she has not appeared in what anybody would consider to be a serious film in nearly four decades. In the meantime her over-indulgence in double-chocolate fudge has lead to successive, unsuccessful battles of the bulge and jokes such as Joan River's announcement that Taylor is doing a remake of National Velvet: \"It's called Crushed Velvet.\" Nonetheless, while Liz's fluctuating weight may have made her a (fuller) figure of fun, her battles with double pneumonia and cancer - when she defiantly displayed her bald head - have revealed her vulnerability, and at the same time made her increasingly invulnerable. Added to that, she's raised more than \u00a3100m for HIV and Aids charities. At heart our Liz is a beautiful, brawling survivor, whose vulgarity and excess of appetite have paradoxically enabled us to share the cinema's great age of glamour. Most of the stars had to fight for fame, then they died or withered under the glare. But because Liz never knew anything else, her normal state has always been one of stardom. She was born a child of the studios, but became her own woman. What a dame. \u0095 A season of Elizabeth Taylor films runs till May 28 at the National Film Theatre. Elizabeth Taylor: a Photographic Celebration opens at the National Portrait Gallery on May 18. The Royal Albert Hall Gala for Elizabeth Taylor's Aids Charitable Trust is on May 26.",

      "body": "<p>Zoe is three and loves playing at being a bookshop owner. She has a toy till with a barcode reader and her shelves are neatly stacked with books. Yet her family are not great book lovers, and her mother Jayne admits she was surprised when her health visitor suggested reading to her daughter when she was only four months old.</p> <p>\"I would never have dreamt that a young baby would sit with me and look at pictures,\" she says. \"At first I felt a bit silly because I was doing all the talking, but after a few weeks she was putting her hand out to the books and, instead of me turning the pages, she was trying to turn them herself.\" </p> <p>Jayne had expected Zoe to rip up the books, but instead she treated them well from the start. \"I've been to friends' houses where they haven't had books from babies. You see books scribbled in, torn and with the pages out. They don't know what to do with them.\" </p> <p>Reading experts Dr Maggie Moore and Professor Barrie Wade are delighted by Zoe's enthusiasm and confident that the time spent sharing books with her parents will stand her in good stead for her school years. </p> <p>Now the former teachers have written Baby Power, a practical guide to choosing the right books for all parents, relatives and carers who want to introduce pre-school children to books but are not sure how. It is complemented by a series of books for children aged nine months to three years that teaches them how to hold a book, that text goes from left to right and about sequence and prediction. </p> <p>Wade, who has taught in primary and secondary schools, stresses that the emphasis in the parental guide is on fun: \"Enjoyment is the key to success and parents get just as much out of it as children. We know this because parents have told us how much pleasure they have reading with their children. In short, having fun is a strong motivating factor.\" </p> <p>And although he shared books with all three of his daughters, Wade, professor of English in Education at Birmingham University, never intended to teach his three daughters to read: \"I just wanted them to enjoy books, but it reached a point where to not allow them to read would have meant hindering the curiosity and appetite for learning which they had developed through book sharing.\" </p> <p>Moore, director of the School of Arts and Social Sciences at Newman College, Birmingham, spent 17 years teaching primary school pupils, including those with special needs, and says she could tell within hours whether or not a child had experience of sharing books with parents. </p> <p>\"Those who had spent lots of time book-sharing had a flying start when entering school because they were confident and enthusiastic - crucial foundations for successful learning. A lot of the time pupils finding learning difficult were not less able - they had simply missed out on the benefits of sharing books, and as a result were less confident.\" What started off as a hunch has now been confirmed by statistical evidence from the Bookstart project, which Wade and Moore launched in 1992, when 300 babies and their families across Birmingham were given free books and encouraged to read together. </p> <p>Their latest research focuses on the performance of the original Bookstart babies, who are now aged seven and eight in their key stage 1 Sats. The aim was to see if those who started primary school so far ahead of their peers remained so. The results show that these children are still approximately 30% ahead in English-based subjects and 25% ahead in maths and science-based subjects - the same advantage as they had on entering the education system in 1997. </p> <p>Jessica Garvey, eight, is one of the original Bookstart babies, and Wade and Moore have dedicated Baby Power to her. After asking the Bookstart babies to take part in tests in 1997, Wade sent a book to them all to say thankyou. Jessica was the only one who wrote a letter back, enclosing a three-page book that she had made at school. </p> <p>\"Jess is no superstar, but she was above average in her Sats, both in literacy and numeracy,\" says her mother Gill. \"She is confident, loves books and often sits down with her six-year-old brother Samuel and reads to him and gets him to read to her.\" </p> <p>Gill Garvey says that if it were not for the Bookstart research she would never have thought about sharing books with Jessica when she was only four months old.

      "bodyText": "Zoe is three and loves playing at being a bookshop owner. She has a toy till with a barcode reader and her shelves are neatly stacked with books. Yet her family are not great book lovers, and her mother Jayne admits she was surprised when her health visitor suggested reading to her daughter when she was only four months old. \"I would never have dreamt that a young baby would sit with me and look at pictures,\" she says. \"At first I felt a bit silly because I was doing all the talking, but after a few weeks she was putting her hand out to the books and, instead of me turning the pages, she was trying to turn them herself.\" Jayne had expected Zoe to rip up the books, but instead she treated them well from the start. \"I've been to friends' houses where they haven't had books from babies. You see books scribbled in, torn and with the pages out. They don't know what to do with them.\" Reading experts Dr Maggie Moore and Professor Barrie Wade are delighted by Zoe's enthusiasm and confident that the time spent sharing books with her parents will stand her in good stead for her school years. Now the former teachers have written Baby Power, a practical guide to choosing the right books for all parents, relatives and carers who want to introduce pre-school children to books but are not sure how. It is complemented by a series of books for children aged nine months to three years that teaches them how to hold a book, that text goes from left to right and about sequence and prediction. Wade, who has taught in primary and secondary schools, stresses that the emphasis in the parental guide is on fun: \"Enjoyment is the key to success and parents get just as much out of it as children. We know this because parents have told us how much pleasure they have reading with their children. In short, having fun is a strong motivating factor.\" And although he shared books with all three of his daughters, Wade, professor of English in Education at Birmingham University, never intended to teach his three daughters to read: \"I just wanted them to enjoy books, but it reached a point where to not allow them to read would have meant hindering the curiosity and appetite for learning which they had developed through book sharing.\" Moore, director of the School of Arts and Social Sciences at Newman College, Birmingham, spent 17 years teaching primary school pupils, including those with special needs, and says she could tell within hours whether or not a child had experience of sharing books with parents. \"Those who had spent lots of time book-sharing had a flying start when entering school because they were confident and enthusiastic - crucial foundations for successful learning. A lot of the time pupils finding learning difficult were not less able - they had simply missed out on the benefits of sharing books, and as a result were less confident.\" What started off as a hunch has now been confirmed by statistical evidence from the Bookstart project, which Wade and Moore launched in 1992, when 300 babies and their families across Birmingham were given free books and encouraged to read together. Their latest research focuses on the performance of the original Bookstart babies, who are now aged seven and eight in their key stage 1 Sats. The aim was to see if those who started primary school so far ahead of their peers remained so. The results show that these children are still approximately 30% ahead in English-based subjects and 25% ahead in maths and science-based subjects - the same advantage as they had on entering the education system in 1997. Jessica Garvey, eight, is one of the original Bookstart babies, and Wade and Moore have dedicated Baby Power to her. After asking the Bookstart babies to take part in tests in 1997, Wade sent a book to them all to say thankyou. Jessica was the only one who wrote a letter back, enclosing a three-page book that she had made at school. \"Jess is no superstar, but she was above average in her Sats, both in literacy and numeracy,\" says her mother Gill. \"She is confident, loves books and often sits down with her six-year-old brother Samuel and reads to him and gets him to read to her.\" Gill Garvey says that if it were not for the Bookstart research she would never have thought about sharing books with Jessica when she was only four months old. She and her husband read to their daughter on a daily basis and \"only when they had time\", but soon noticed the results. \"Jess was inquisitive and lively, and when she started speaking had a good range of vocabulary. I would recommend Bookstart to all parents.\" Through a \u00a36m sponsorship deal with Sainsbury's, the scheme is now operating throughout Britain and aims to provide every baby with a free book by the end of this year. The millionth book was given out earlier this year. Impressed by the success of Bookstart, the Japanese government is setting up a scheme along the same lines and other countries have expressed interest. Wade even goes as far as to suggest that with adequate funding Bookstart could meet all educational targets. \"We know that regular book sharing will lay the foundations of literacy, and that should mean fewer learning difficulties when the child starts school. I would even say that GCSE results could be affected by the way a baby interacts with its parents.\" But although Wade and Moore hope that nearly all parents will realise the benefits of reading, they do not want parents to become competitive about their children's progress. \"We are making real progress at the moment,\" says Moore. \"But if we end up like America, where children undergo assessment all the time, we will have failed.\" Early readers Do \u0095 Make it fun for both you and the baby and praise him or her. \u0095 Talk about the book and its pictures even if you think your baby doesn't understand. \u0095 Let your baby hold and handle the book and turn the pages. \u0095 Take your baby to the library and let your baby choose the books. \u0095 Read a book lots of times because your baby won't get bored.

I have asked Stephen Byers [the trade secretary] to keep me personally in touch with the developments and I am pleased that he has helped ensure that any bid from Phoenix will be given proper consideration. </p> <p>\"At the end of the day, it has to be a commercial decision for BMW and any potential bidder.

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair promised to work \"night and day\" to help rescue jobs at the stricken car maker Rover, and Downing Street officials are intervening directly to win breathing space for the Phoenix consortium in its attempts to take over the Longbridge plant. Senior officials are taking advantage of the close relations between the German chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, and Mr Blair to exert political leverage on Rover's parent, BMW, not to shut the plant until Phoenix has had every opportunity to put together a viable offer. In a statement yesterday Mr Blair said: \"I want to reassure the people of the West Midlands that I and the government stand ready to do whatever we can for the workers at Longbridge and the region as a whole. I have asked Stephen Byers [the trade secretary] to keep me personally in touch with the developments and I am pleased that he has helped ensure that any bid from Phoenix will be given proper consideration. \"At the end of the day, it has to be a commercial decision for BMW and any potential bidder. We will continue to work night and day to secure the best interests of the workers, their families and the West Midlands.\" European Union rules on state aid necessitate lengthy examination of any government aid and a guarantee that the rescue will be viable. Brussels will also insist on a sizeable proportion of the funding for Phoenix coming from private sources, which may cause further delay. With Phoenix executives due to hold a critical meeting today with BMW chiefs, it emerged that a No 10 aide had asked Chancellor Schr\u00f6der's office to impress upon BMW the need to give the consortium every opportunity to rescue Rover and the plant in Birmingham. BMW warned last week that failure to strike a deal within a month would result in the liquidation of Rover. On Friday, BMW's favoured bidder for Rover, the Alchemy venture-capital fund, unexpectedly pulled out of talks to buy Longbridge. The fund said there was a \"chasm\" between itself and BMW on several financial issues, believed to include the costs of paying off redundant workers and compensating Rover dealers. Alchemy had made it clear that it was interested only in manufacturing a relatively small number of sports saloons and would wind up Rover's volume car activities. Trade unions denounced Alchemy as an asset stripper, and Mr Byers called for a solution that would maintain mass production at Longbridge. Phoenix is headed by Rover's former chief executive, John Towers, and its backers include Rover dealers, venture capitalists and John Hemming, the software multi-millionaire and would-be Liberal Democrat mayor of Birmingham. Mr Towers knows the bid must not rely on heavy public assistance. However, an aid package of some sort would be essential to get Longbridge back in business, possibly similar to the \u00a3152m in grants that Mr Byers was proposing to BMW before it decided to end its six-year entanglement with Rover. Yesterday the Department of Trade and Industry confirmed that this proposal will have lapsed and that any new aid deal will need to be resubmitted to the EU for approval. There is no \"fast track\" and the process could take several months. Meanwhile sales of Rover cars soared in April amid heavy discounting. The group's market share more than doubled to top 12%.

      "bodyText": "British films will have bigger budgets - but fewer of them will be made - in the most radical shake-up of the industry in a generation. The Film Council, which will be launched this morning by the culture secretary, Chris Smith, and the film director, Alan Parker, is to steer filmmakers towards making commercial movies which will be able to compete head-to-head with Hollywood. With little more than half of the 110 films made in the UK last year ever likely to be seen in cinemas, what Mr Parker - who directed such hits as The Commitments and Bugsy Malone - has created is a powerful, hard-nosed, semi-state talent factory which will be able to pick winners and be unafraid of getting into bed with American studios. Nearly half the council's \u00a322m will be used to back \"popular, mainstream films\" - the sort which Mr Parker and fellow board member Duncan Kenworthy, who produced Four Weddings and a Funeral, tend to make, and which the public flock to the multiplexes to see. A further \u00a34.2m will go towards European co-productions, which again is likely to be tilted towards out-and-out commercial projects. A \u00a35m New Cinema Fund will back more radical films, although even here the council expects the odd offbeat hit. \"No one wants to make films that are only seen by the filmmakers, their families and the crew,\" said Mr Kenworthy. \"We are about building a sustainable industry that can stand on its own feet.\" The major shift of emphasis, however, is that a quarter of the budget will be spent on developing screenplays and training writers, an area in which the British industry has a woeful record. One of the main criticisms of the previous lottery system was that films rushed into production without sufficient work on their scripts in order to qualify for lottery money. With less than a tenth of the \u00a3105m doled out by the lottery so far recouped from successful films, something had to be done. Although the deluge of cash sparked a boom in filmmaking, the lottery will be more remembered for turkeys like Rancid Aluminium and The Secret Laughter of Women. There were notable successes - Lynne Ramsay's Rat catcher might never have been made without it - but its main legacy is a glut of mundane \u00a33m films, many made without an audience in mind. Mr Kenworthy, whose production arm DNA is one of three separate, and so far more successful mini-studios set up by the lottery, said that there was an imbalance in the British industry, with too many low-budget films. \"One of the truisms of the film business is that the more money a film costs the more it is likely to make.\" John Woodward, chief executive, said the new council would not be hamstrung by the arcane rules which restricted the Arts Council's lottery film board to giving money to productions that would not otherwise be made. The lottery principle of \"additionality\" - which in effect filtered out those films that stood a chance of making money, by insisting that lottery funds should be in addition to existing public spending - was the first thing to go when the council was first mooted by Mr Smith. Mr Woodward said the council wanted to be in at the beginning of projects where it could exercise the most leverage from its initial investment. Mr Parker, the chairman, said the key was to bring on screenwriters and industry executives. \"The measures we are announcing are geared to specific priorities which must be addressed if we want the basis for a real industry producing stronger films.\" Lottery losers at box office \u0095 Stephen Poliakoff's Food of Love cost \u00a32.1m to make (\u00a3800,000 from the lottery) but made only \u00a31,507 at the box office. \u0095 The Secret Laughter of Women, starring Colin Firth, cost \u00a33.3m but took just \u00a32,832 after getting a lottery of grant of just less than \u00a31m. \u0095 Los Angeles Without a Map cost \u00a34.9m - \u00a3870,000 of which was from the lottery - but took only \u00a3 3,641 here. \u0095 The Last Yellow got a \u00a3500,000 lottery grant but took less than \u00a35,000 at the box office. \u0095 A Kind of Hush created a kind of hush by taking \u00a35,800 despite a lottery investment of \u00a3750,000. \u0095 The Slab Boys made \u00a316,000 from \u00a3500,000 given by the Scottish Arts Council.",

Playing hardball, eh? A monkey then. But that's my final offer. </strong> Er. I think you've got the wrong end of the stick. A valuer doesn't go around trying to buy stuff on the cheap. He or she is expected to provide an independent assessment of how much something is worth, taking into account age, condition and rarity. </p> <p><strong> Oh well. So what sort of things do you value then? </strong> The most common duties in general practice are valuations of land and property. </p> <p><strong> I get it. Location, location, location.</strong> That's estate agent speak and we're not just trying to impress potential vendors on how much they might get for their properties. We're a little more sophisticated than that, as we provide the information on which banks and building societies lend money. So we take into account the location, the state of repair and the price similar properties sell for at public auction, which is often lower than that achieved with private treaty sales. </p> <p><strong> Is that it?</strong> Far from it. We also negotiate compensation for compulsory purchases, determine fair rents and advise clients on the development potential of a piece of land. So you have to be able to understand technical drawings, be familiar with planning law, and to assess building costs. If you specialise in agricultural practice you will also be expected to be involved in and be familiar with farm management, tenants rights, the construction and repair of farm buildings, live and dead stock, cattle auctions and the markets for agricultural machinery and construction. </p> <p><strong> You make it sound just like The Archers. Are there any other media jobs going? What about those blokes on the Antiques Road Show who get to tell all those punters who have queued up for days that their family heirlooms are valueless? </strong> Yes, the job does have its perks. And yes, valuation does include fine art, antiques and various other goods and chattels for the purposes of inheritance tax, probate, insurance and sale by auction. However, these are highly specialised areas and you will probably be expected to have taken a full-time degree or diploma in fine arts valuation. </p> <p><strong> Will I have to wear a silly bow-tie, as well?</strong> No. But it wouldn't hurt if you wanted to make a career on the telly out of it. </p> <p><strong> So what else should I know? </strong> A clean driving licence is a big help. You should also be able to present ideas and information clearly, both verbally and in writing, and you must also be numerate, accurate and up to date with the relevant legislation and technology. </p> <p><strong> Are there any entry requirements?</strong> Membership of a professional body, such as the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors is strongly recommended. The Architects and Surveyors Institute will also send out information on becoming a valuer. There are also HND and degree courses in some subjects, such as estate management and surveying, that exempt you from certain professional exams. It is also possible to be trained on the job with part-time or correspondence courses? </p> <p><strong> Who will employ me?</strong> Building societies, insurance companies, property companies or any other organisation that needs information on commercial value. </p> <p><strong> So, how much will I earn?</strong> A trainee will start on \u00a38,000-\u00a313,000 depending on age and qualifications. </p> <p><strong> Can we call that \u00a310,000-\u00a315,000?</strong> No. </p> <p>\u0095 learndirect 0800 100900 may be able to give further information and advice on courses </p> <p>\u0095 <strong>The Royal Institute for Chartered Surveyors</strong>, Surveyor Court, Westwood Way, Coventry CV4 8JE Telephone: 020-7235 2282 </p> <p>\u0095 <strong>The Institute of Revenues, Rating &amp; Valuation</strong>, 41 Doughty Street, London WC1N 2LF </p> <p>\u0095 <strong>Architects and Surveyors Institute</strong>, St Mary's House, 15 St Mary Street, Chippenham, Wilts SN15 3WD Telephone: 01249-444 505 Fax: 01249-443 602 email: <a href=\"mailto:asinst@aol.com\">asinst@aol.com</a></p>",

We're a little more sophisticated than that, as we provide the information on which banks and building societies lend money. So we take into account the location, the state of repair and the price similar properties sell for at public auction, which is often lower than that achieved with private treaty sales. Is that it? Far from it. We also negotiate compensation for compulsory purchases, determine fair rents and advise clients on the development potential of a piece of land. So you have to be able to understand technical drawings, be familiar with planning law, and to assess building costs. If you specialise in agricultural practice you will also be expected to be involved in and be familiar with farm management, tenants rights, the construction and repair of farm buildings, live and dead stock, cattle auctions and the markets for agricultural machinery and construction. You make it sound just like The Archers. Are there any other media jobs going? What about those blokes on the Antiques Road Show who get to tell all those punters who have queued up for days that their family heirlooms are valueless? Yes, the job does have its perks. And yes, valuation does include fine art, antiques and various other goods and chattels for the purposes of inheritance tax, probate, insurance and sale by auction. However, these are highly specialised areas and you will probably be expected to have taken a full-time degree or diploma in fine arts valuation. Will I have to wear a silly bow-tie, as well? No. But it wouldn't hurt if you wanted to make a career on the telly out of it. So what else should I know? A clean driving licence is a big help. You should also be able to present ideas and information clearly, both verbally and in writing, and you must also be numerate, accurate and up to date with the relevant legislation and technology. Are there any entry requirements? Membership of a professional body, such as the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors is strongly recommended. The Architects and Surveyors Institute will also send out information on becoming a valuer. There are also HND and degree courses in some subjects, such as estate management and surveying, that exempt you from certain professional exams. It is also possible to be trained on the job with part-time or correspondence courses? Who will employ me? Building societies, insurance companies, property companies or any other organisation that needs information on commercial value. So, how much will I earn? A trainee will start on \u00a38,000-\u00a313,000 depending on age and qualifications. Can we call that \u00a310,000-\u00a315,000?

One of the sections is dedicated to laughter - an excellent resource for anyone intrigued by the French sense of humour. The number of links is colossal and merits at least an hour. (In French). Radio France *** Aimed at: everyone Listen to a 90-second news bulletin from Radio France. The contents are updated 42 times each day and students can replay the broadcast for listening practice. Universal French Dictionary Online *** Aimed at: everyone A basic French-French dictionary, placed online for the benefit of French-speaking populations around the world. For English-French and French-English translations, try Babelfish. Teaching with Internet FAQ **** Aimed at: teachers The American Association of Teachers of French has compiled a useful collection of links for teachers. The copyright information, however, draws on US law and should be treated cautiously. Really Useful French Teaching Site **** Aimed at: teachers A witty, sympathetic site assembled by a teacher at a Beacon School in Lancashire. Teachers are invited to download worksheets, the cartoon adventures of photographer Victor Vaurien, and online and offline exercises. Kolymbia Midis Sound *** Aimed at: everyone Don't be misled by the sight of a naked, pouting woman with only a newspaper to cover herself: it is no guide to the contents. The site holds sound files and lyrics from French pop, which you can follow on screen. The (virtual) baguette *** Aimed at: everyone Despite the title, this online zine is written entirely in French and aimed at teenagers. It successfully taps into the adolescent preoccupations of music, sci-fi, TV, computers and football. Premiers Pas sur Internet *** Aimed at: everyone Written for native speakers of primary age, Premiers Pas is also a useful source of stories and activities for French teachers of young children and their parents.",

      "body": "<p>Oprah Winfrey, the ubiquitous American television chat-show host, has entered the academic canon. Reading Oprah, a new fourth-year undergraduate course at the University of Alberta, in Canada, examines themes ranging from the celebrity's performances in the movies The Color Purple and Beloved, the cultural significance of her role as a television presenter and even her diet and exercise book.</p> <p>The course concludes with an Oprah exam, in which students create an edition of The Oprah Winfrey Show complete with a detailed proposal and a guest lineup. Reading Oprah comes at a time when some students on both sides of the Atlantic will be doing just that - if their bookstores stock The Oprah Magazine, whose first issue appears in the US and Britain this month. </p> <p>The magazine maintains that one can and should feel better about oneself - \"This magazine is about helping you become more of who you are,\" says Winfrey's introductory note. There are many references to overeating, and in a nine-page interview she talks to the wife of actor Bill Cosby, Camille, about menopause and the pain of learning to love oneself. </p> <p>The three-month-long course is the brainchild of Daphne Read, an associate professor of English, and springs from its instructor's interest in women's studies, group counselling and African-American literature. Elements of all three are present in the televisual persona of Winfrey, says Read. What the programme attempts, she says, is to \"encourage people to go beyond the normal knee-jerk response to Oprah, positive or negative, and take a look at her on a deeper level.\" </p> <p>Reading Oprah was sparked by an afternoon spent in Edmonton watching the programme. Soon afterwards, she recalls, \"I was back at the university talking with a couple of colleagues about how bright and vital I thought she was. 'Somebody should do a course on her,' I said. My colleagues said I sounded like the person to do it - so I did.\" </p> <p>Reading Oprah made its debut late last year, attracting 23 participants, two of them men. Students examined the \"works\" of Winfrey and, says Read, sought to locate her personality \"within a larger intellectual and activist context, tracing her explicit and implicit affiliations with contemporary African American intellectuals and casting her self-help work in a more politicised historical framework\". </p> <p>Contemporary feminism, says Read, \"has many strands, but among all of them there is this issue of reaching out beyond the converted, of getting to a wider audience. And Oprah, for me and others, is somebody who's doing this.\" </p> <p>And trousering lots of loot along the way.

      "bodyText": "Oprah Winfrey, the ubiquitous American television chat-show host, has entered the academic canon. Reading Oprah, a new fourth-year undergraduate course at the University of Alberta, in Canada, examines themes ranging from the celebrity's performances in the movies The Color Purple and Beloved, the cultural significance of her role as a television presenter and even her diet and exercise book. The course concludes with an Oprah exam, in which students create an edition of The Oprah Winfrey Show complete with a detailed proposal and a guest lineup. Reading Oprah comes at a time when some students on both sides of the Atlantic will be doing just that - if their bookstores stock The Oprah Magazine, whose first issue appears in the US and Britain this month. The magazine maintains that one can and should feel better about oneself - \"This magazine is about helping you become more of who you are,\" says Winfrey's introductory note. There are many references to overeating, and in a nine-page interview she talks to the wife of actor Bill Cosby, Camille, about menopause and the pain of learning to love oneself. The three-month-long course is the brainchild of Daphne Read, an associate professor of English, and springs from its instructor's interest in women's studies, group counselling and African-American literature. Elements of all three are present in the televisual persona of Winfrey, says Read. What the programme attempts, she says, is to \"encourage people to go beyond the normal knee-jerk response to Oprah, positive or negative, and take a look at her on a deeper level.\" Reading Oprah was sparked by an afternoon spent in Edmonton watching the programme. Soon afterwards, she recalls, \"I was back at the university talking with a couple of colleagues about how bright and vital I thought she was. 'Somebody should do a course on her,' I said. My colleagues said I sounded like the person to do it - so I did.\" Reading Oprah made its debut late last year, attracting 23 participants, two of them men. Students examined the \"works\" of Winfrey and, says Read, sought to locate her personality \"within a larger intellectual and activist context, tracing her explicit and implicit affiliations with contemporary African American intellectuals and casting her self-help work in a more politicised historical framework\". Contemporary feminism, says Read, \"has many strands, but among all of them there is this issue of reaching out beyond the converted, of getting to a wider audience. And Oprah, for me and others, is somebody who's doing this.\" And trousering lots of loot along the way. By the reckoning of Forbes magazine, Winfrey's personal worth currently stands at \u00a3420m. Ironically enough, perhaps, a portion of that income has come from academe. Last year she taught a course on the dynamics of leadership at Northwestern University in Chicago, during which she was an adjunct professor of management and strategy. She has also been known to give academics a boost - in 1997 exposure on her programme's book club turned Stones From the River, written by the American scholar Ursula Hegi, into a respectable national seller. In these other ways, Read believes, \"Oprah has presence - and yes, that comes from having economic power. But she uses this to promote a coherent social vision. What she does is encourage people to think critically, at least in terms of where they're at. And that's what I've tried to do with this course.\"",

      "body": "<p>Teachers in England are losing their vision and becoming increasingly more formal and authoritarian in their approach to teaching, according to a new study. They are, in short, becoming more like the French.</p> <p>The research carried out by Quest (the Quality of Education: Children's Experiences of Schooling in England and France) and led by Patricia Broadfoot, Professor of Education at Bristol University and co-author of Promoting Quality in Learning: Does England have the answer? suggests that by adopting an educational system which mirrors the French one, Britain will cease to produce a workforce of team players and lateral thinkers. </p> <p>Although, according to the French government, there are now more than 250,000 French people living and working in Britain, Broadfoot and her team argue that the English education system is actually becoming very much like the French one in its constant quest for academic excellence. The project highlights the unique benefits of education in Britain and suggests that for the British economy to succeed in the global market, these strengths must be maintained. </p> <p>The Quest team compares the opinions and outlook of British and French children between nine and 11, and challenges the dominant belief that the French educational system is innately better than its British counterpart. \"One of the significant differences between English and French children is that English children are a lot more confident when it comes to thinking on their feet, they are very good at knowing what to do when they don't know what to do,\" says Broadfoot. \"Although French children are significantly more positive about school, they are subjected to a much more formal, authoritarian approach to teaching and this can often be very constricting.\" </p> <p>Broadfoot and her team believe that this raises questions about the benefits of many of the current educational reforms being introduced by the government. By limiting the role of the teachers to the very narrow boundaries of the classroom, the researchers feel that the education system will suffer. \"The French teacher's goal is quite simply that pupils should master the material being taught, whereas English teachers place a lot more emphasis on encouraging children to think for themselves, they are also more active in promoting understanding and knowledge through problem-solving,\" says Broadfoot. </p> <p>The researchers believe that education plays a different role in different societies and this is likely to affect motivation as much as pupils' experience at school. The Quest team discovered that French children were significantly more positive about school than their British counterparts and were \"more likely to see teaching as helpful and useful to them even though the classroom was typically more formal and authoritarian\".</p> <p>While only 35% of English children were proud of their nationality, 57% of French children felt glad that they were French. The research also found that French children were a lot less concerned with the personal characteristics of their teachers and thought that a good quality in a teacher was that they would make their pupils work hard. </p> <p>Parent of three Jo Putler has had experience of both the French and English education systems and believes that Britain is increasingly adopting a more continental approach in both primary and secondary education. \"With the increased rigidity of the national curriculum, the English education system is becoming very much like the French one; however, French teachers are a lot more comfortable with their system because it has been in place for years,\" says Putler. </p> <p>The Putlers lived in a small French village for a year during 1987. \"The children were educated at the village school and there was a lot of sitting in rows and teaching by the book, especially in grammar and handwriting. However, they also had the opportunity to do extra-curricular activities. The teacher would take them out on country walks to elaborate on the science and geography lessons,\" remembers Putler. </p> <p>After moving back to England, the Putlers decided to send their children to London's French Lyc\u00e9e. \"The Lyc\u00e9e is very old-fashioned in its approach to teaching and the children are not offered much in the way of creative writing, but I don't think it is typical of all French schools,\" says Putler. </p> <p>Sam Banner, a French language teacher at a state comprehensive in Birmingham, believes that French education is generally more narrow in its scope than in Britain. Having taught in Aix-en-Provence for two years, she believes that \"although French children generally seem a lot keener to benefit from their education they are limited in their ability to take risks and experiment.\" Banner thinks that \"French teachers see their teaching role as one which should focus on good results; although British teachers do this, they tend not to be so strict, they encourage the children to experiment to a greater extent.\" </p> <p> The study documents the achievements of British children and although the researchers admit that there are weaknesses in certain areas, they emphasise that there are also many strengths. \"The study highlights the fact that British children are trailing behind in their mathematical skills, but they are holding their own in writing, grammar and spelling, and they are excellent in thinking for themselves and being creative. This is something which the French children lack,\" says Broadfoot. \"A lot of improvements have been made to the standard of British education recently, but it is important that we look to the future and do not get tied down with relentless testing and the quest for better results at the expense of losing the unique talents of British teachers.\" </p> <p>Jean-Michel Fouquet, headmaster of the Charles de Gaulle French Lyc\u00e9e in London, thinks that it is important not to exaggerate the differences between the two systems. \"Both the English and French systems are much less clear-cut than they once were,\" says Fouquet. \"It is true that some of the more creative aspects of teaching may not be implemented in French schools, especially in subjects like science and mathematics, but things are changing and French teachers are listening to what their pupils have to say to a greater extent.\"</p> <p>Fouquet believes that the French system is more rigid when it comes to the levels of attainment of its pupils. \"French children are very structured in what they achieve each school year. For example, any French child could go to any French school and learn exactly the same thing wherever he or she was. Equally, if you were to go into any French school on any day of the week, the teachers would be teaching exactly the same thing to the same year group.\" </p> <p>All too often the British education system is seen as the poor cousin of other countries within western Europe and beyond. However, the Quest team is keen to stress the importance of many aspects of the British system. \"Whilst other countries have been the envy of the world in the capacity of their students to achieve on conventional tests of achievement, it is these same countries that are now desperate to find ways of encouraging their students to be creative problem-solvers, team-workers and risk-takers,\" says Broadfoot. \"It is these skills which will determine the economic tigers of tomorrow.\"</p> <p>When Napoleon Bonaparte remarked that the British were a nation of shopkeepers, he may well have been referring to the entrepreneurial spirit and creativity that underpin the economy and which Broadfoot believes must be kept alive in British schools.</p> <p>\u0095 Promoting Quality in Learning: Does England have the answer?

Parent of three Jo Putler has had experience of both the French and English education systems and believes that Britain is increasingly adopting a more continental approach in both primary and secondary education. \"With the increased rigidity of the national curriculum, the English education system is becoming very much like the French one; however, French teachers are a lot more comfortable with their system because it has been in place for years,\" says Putler. The Putlers lived in a small French village for a year during 1987. \"The children were educated at the village school and there was a lot of sitting in rows and teaching by the book, especially in grammar and handwriting. However, they also had the opportunity to do extra-curricular activities. The teacher would take them out on country walks to elaborate on the science and geography lessons,\" remembers Putler. After moving back to England, the Putlers decided to send their children to London's French Lyc\u00e9e. \"The Lyc\u00e9e is very old-fashioned in its approach to teaching and the children are not offered much in the way of creative writing, but I don't think it is typical of all French schools,\" says Putler. Sam Banner, a French language teacher at a state comprehensive in Birmingham, believes that French education is generally more narrow in its scope than in Britain. Having taught in Aix-en-Provence for two years, she believes that \"although French children generally seem a lot keener to benefit from their education they are limited in their ability to take risks and experiment.\" Banner thinks that \"French teachers see their teaching role as one which should focus on good results; although British teachers do this, they tend not to be so strict, they encourage the children to experiment to a greater extent.\" The study documents the achievements of British children and although the researchers admit that there are weaknesses in certain areas, they emphasise that there are also many strengths. \"The study highlights the fact that British children are trailing behind in their mathematical skills, but they are holding their own in writing, grammar and spelling, and they are excellent in thinking for themselves and being creative. This is something which the French children lack,\" says Broadfoot. \"A lot of improvements have been made to the standard of British education recently, but it is important that we look to the future and do not get tied down with relentless testing and the quest for better results at the expense of losing the unique talents of British teachers.\" Jean-Michel Fouquet, headmaster of the Charles de Gaulle French Lyc\u00e9e in London, thinks that it is important not to exaggerate the differences between the two systems. \"Both the English and French systems are much less clear-cut than they once were,\" says Fouquet. \"It is true that some of the more creative aspects of teaching may not be implemented in French schools, especially in subjects like science and mathematics, but things are changing and French teachers are listening to what their pupils have to say to a greater extent.\" Fouquet believes that the French system is more rigid when it comes to the levels of attainment of its pupils. \"French children are very structured in what they achieve each school year. For example, any French child could go to any French school and learn exactly the same thing wherever he or she was. Equally, if you were to go into any French school on any day of the week, the teachers would be teaching exactly the same thing to the same year group.\" All too often the British education system is seen as the poor cousin of other countries within western Europe and beyond. However, the Quest team is keen to stress the importance of many aspects of the British system. \"Whilst other countries have been the envy of the world in the capacity of their students to achieve on conventional tests of achievement, it is these same countries that are now desperate to find ways of encouraging their students to be creative problem-solvers, team-workers and risk-takers,\" says Broadfoot. \"It is these skills which will determine the economic tigers of tomorrow.\" When Napoleon Bonaparte remarked that the British were a nation of shopkeepers, he may well have been referring to the entrepreneurial spirit and creativity that underpin the economy and which Broadfoot believes must be kept alive in British schools. \u0095 Promoting Quality in Learning: Does England have the answer?

It could even be argued that universities have become even more socially divisive than they were before the Robbins report in 1963. Between 1928 and 1947, some 8.9% of all boys from non-manual backgrounds entered university, compared to 1.4% of all boys from manual backgrounds. By the time of Robbins, 16.8% of boys from non-manual backgrounds entered higher education, and 2.6% of boys from manual backgrounds (data on the background of women students does not seem to have been reported).</p> <p>The expansion of the past decade has made it even more likely that the higher socio-economic group participate in higher education: 80% of children from social class one backgrounds attend university, while less than one in eight children from an unskilled manual background enters higher education. </p> <p>What of gender equality? Whilst the earlier under-representation of women in higher education overall has been rectified, there remain major gender inequalities in many subjects: for example, insufficient men taking education courses, too few women in science and engineering. The incorporation of ethnic minorities into higher education shows a similar erratic pattern. What appears overall to be a major change as substantial numbers of ethnic minorities enter higher education, masks the exclusion of particular groups - Bangladeshi females, African-Caribbean males - as well as the fact that they are particularly concentrated in a few universities. </p> <p>This is a system - as Blunkett says - of \"the entrenched exclusion of large sections of our society from higher education\". Universities are now reproducing social inequality more efficiently than they ever have in the past. They have replaced the grammar school as the prime instrument of entrenching social stratification. </p> <p>Lord Dearing pointed out in the National Committee of Inquiry into Higher Education that higher education was not powerless to affect the participation rates of under-represented groups. The Hefce Performance Indicators in Higher Education 1996-98, which were produced last December, were supposed to offer a measure of the extent to which different institutions were addressing social exclusion. However, they did this through setting individual \"benchmarks\" for each institution, based simply on the degree of social inclusion that might be expected given the particular entry qualifications of their current students.</p> <p>This amounts to saying that if an institution only takes students with very high A level grades, then it can't be expected to take on many students from the lower socio-economic classes, or students from ethnic minority backgrounds. The Hefce tables for the participation of under-represented groups are simply an acceptance of the status quo, and are being used to justify inaction. </p> <p>The excuse offered is that our universities have diverse missions, and thus cannot be directly compared: this apparently allows some universities to have a mission that does not address questions of social inclusion. </p> <p>We propose to construct alternative measures of the role of individual universities in contributing to social inclusion. </p> <p>Dearing included amongst the purposes of universities the promotion of social cohesion and the development of lifelong learning and the creation of \"the learning society\", as well as economic regeneration and development. Blunkett has echoed this in his Greenwich speech. We propose the creation of three new scales to measure how much each area of each university's work contributes to these objectives. </p> <p>First, we propose to measure added social inclusion: how much does each institution, in each subject band, contribute to the inclusion of all socio-economic groups and of all ethnic groups, in a gender-neutral manner? </p> <p>We know that overall, universities recruit males and females equally, but we should be measuring success in this area in terms of balances in each subject band, not in gross terms. </p> <p>Compare two hypothetical institutions, each recruiting only engineers and teachers: </p> <p>Institution A appears to do better overall than institution B: but given the overall national gender imbalance in undergraduate numbers in these two subjects, institution B is in reality doing a better job at addressing under-representation. What is needed is a measure that reflects which groups are under-represented in each area in higher education, compared to the distribution of each group in the 18-30 year-old population of the country. If there are 51% of females of student age in the country, then we should expect to find that proportion in each subject area in the higher education sector. </p> <p>We will determine - by gender, ethnicity and social class - the distribution of young people receiving higher education in each subject grouping, and compare this to the distribution of the same groups in the population of young people in the country as a whole. Where there is a shortfall, we will then determine which institutions are recruiting to address that shortfall, weighting each contribution according to the degree that the group is under-represented in the higher education population. </p> <p>To develop the example above, assume that the proportion of male to female engineers in higher education undergraduate courses across the country is 80:20, and in education courses is 30:70. </p> <p>The difference between the population as a whole and the percentage of students in the higher education sector in the subject indicates where the under-representation lies, and its magnitude. </p> <p>In engineering, there is a 31% shortfall of females, in education, there is a shortfall of 19% males. We therefore weight each of these students according to how much they are not represented in the total higher education population. </p> <p>In our measurement system, institutions that successfully recruit these under-represented groups are rewarded by multiplying the percentage that they recruit by the degree of under-representation. Thus, in our two hypothetical institutions, institution A, even though it has a 50:50 male/female split, emerges with no points, while institution B gets 9.3 for attracting rare and valuable female engineers, and a further 9.0 for attracting more (but not quite so rare) male education students. Our calculations will be more detailed than the example above, as we will examine subjects on a three-way table of gender, ethnicity and social class. This will allow us to address such particular groups as Caribbean men, and Bangladeshi women. </p> <p>Second, we propose to measure the added economic value of institutions. We know the incomes achieved by university graduates three years after graduation - by the type of university, subject, and by the gender and ethnicity of the individual, from the recent report from the Institute for Employment Research/CSU, entitled Moving On: Graduate careers three years after graduation. </p> <p>Given the total subject mix, degree class results and ethnic and gender composition of each institution's graduates, we can calculate the average earnings of the graduates from every institution. We also know what a similar person, of the same age, would be earning if they had chosen not to go to a particular university, despite having the qualifications to do so. The difference between the two would seem to be a very real proxy for the \"added value\" of a degree in a particular subject area, from a particular university, for an individual with a particular social background. </p> <p>Our third proposed measure is of lifelong learning. We propose three equal elements to this scale. An age-on-admission index of full-time and part-time students will show how good institutions are at recruiting students during life, rather than simply post-school. And a measure of how much institutions are recognising and valuing qualifications acquired by applicants after formal schooling. Third, a simple index of the proportion of part-time students will show how much an institution is allowing students to study concurrently with \"life\" outside. </p> <p>At Greenwich, David Blunkett proposed \"extra resources [to] unlock engagement in higher education from communities in which there is no expectation of it at present\". The measures we propose may well tell him where to direct those resources in future.</p> <p>\u0095 These proposals are part of an <a href=\"http://www.unl.ac.uk/socialinclusion\">online discussion</a>, where references and further details of methodology are discussed.

Other teachers are phoning the churches to find out about secondhand clothing and furniture for our students. We have to deal with mental health problems too. Many asylum seekers are traumatised and deeply unhappy. A few are aggressive. What is going on? Who is responsible for all this? Why were we not given any warning of these numbers in September so that we could prepare to run extra classes? We have always taken pride in our Esol department, seeing ourselves as a happy and successful part of the college, efficiently led by a section leader who is both professional and compassionate and with classes of satisfied and hard-working students. Now we find ourselves exhausted, demoralised and embarrassed at having to turn so many people away. We are haunted by the corridor people, their faces pressed against the glass of our staffroom door. It feels as if we are in a kind of corridor too, a halfway place between compassion and frustration, and Britain seems to be in a kind of large-scale corridor of its own, not sure whether it is helping asylum seekers or punishing them. One thing seems certain - if we continue to move vast numbers of people around the country to areas of high unemployment without any support systems in place for them, we are storing up trouble that will explode in a way which lowly further education teachers cannot control. I recently set a class the mundane homework task of designing an information leaflet for public library users. A Kurdish refugee wrote: \"You have to be careful when you choose the book because from those books which you will read, the Iraqi security service will know how do you think. You can find these books are against the Iraqi government but you cannot read them. If you read them, you will go to the prison as soon as possible.\" In a country where we have the luxury of reading the books of our choice, could we not also offer a little more practical help to people from countries where this is not possible?",

In Bram Stoker's 1897 novel the young lawyer Jonathan Harker finds himself in Dracula's castle at the head of the Borgo Pass arranging the details of the undead count's emigration to Whitby and then London, and a reign of lurid terror which ends climactically in a knife thrust and a crumble of dust on a box of earth in the Borgo Pass.

There will be no stake or mallet, no garlic or crucifixes. And there will only be one box, one metre cubed (in the novel, Dracula shipped 24 of them).

      "body": "<p>Ahead of them, the sun had risen above the car's roof, leaving the windscreen filled with a harsh unpunctuated whiteness that threatened to become painful. The forest on the driver's side thinned out and was replaced by a steep embankment infested with creepers and bluebells. Signs printed in several languages unknown to Isserley reminded foreigners not to drive on the wrong side of the road.</p> <p>The temperature inside the car was approaching stifling, even for Isserley, who could tolerate extremes without particularly caring. Her glasses were starting to fog up, but she couldn't take them off now: he mustn't see her eyes without them. A slow, subtle trickle of perspiration ran down her neck onto her breastbone, hesitating on the brink of her cleavage. Her hitcher seemed not to notice. His hands were drumming desultorily on his inner thighs to some tune she couldn't hear; as soon as he realized she was watching, he stopped abruptly and folded his hands limply over his crotch.</p> <p>What on earth had happened to him? What had brought on this dismal metamorphosis? Just as she'd grown to appreciate how attractive a prospect he was, he seemed to be shrinking before her eyes; he wasn't the same male she'd taken into her car twenty minutes ago. Was he one of those inadequate lugs whose sexual self-confidence depended on not being reminded of any real females? Or was it her fault?</p> <p>'You can open a window if you're too hot,' she offered.</p> <p>He nodded, didn't even speak.</p> <p>Isserley pressed her foot gingerly down on the accelerator, hoping this would please him. But he just sighed and settled further back in his seat, as if what he considered to be an insignificant increase in speed only reminded him how slowly they were getting nowhere.</p> <p>Maybe she shouldn't have said she was a lawyer. Maybe a shop assistant or an infant teacher would have brought him out more. It was just that she'd taken him to be a rough, robust kind of character; she'd thought he might have a criminal history he'd start to talk about, as a way of teasing her, testing her out. Maybe the only truly safe thing she could have been was a housewife.</p> <p>'Your wife,' she rejoined, striving for a reassuring, companionable, male sort of tone, a tone he might expect from a drinking buddy. 'Did she get the house?'</p> <p>'Yeah . . . well . . . no . . .' He drew a deep breath. 'I had to sell it, and give her half. She went to live in Bradford. I stayed on here.'</p> <p>'Where's here?' she asked, nodding her head at the open road, hoping to remind him how far she had taken him already.</p> <p>'Milnafua.' He sniggered, as if self-conscious about the name.</p> <p>To Isserley, Milnafua sounded perfectly normal; more normal in fact than London or Dundee, which she had some trouble getting her tongue round. She appreciated, however, that to him it represented some outlandish extreme.</p> <p>'There's no work anywhere up there, is there,' she suggested, hoping she was striking a matter-of-fact, masculine note of sympathy.</p> <p>'Don't I know it,' he mumbled. Then, with a startling boost of volume and pitch: 'Still, got to keep trying, eh?'</p> <p>Looking at him in disbelief, she confirmed what he was playing at: a pathetic gesture towards optimism, missing the mark by miles. He was even smiling, his face sheened with sweat, as if he'd suddenly become convinced it was dangerous to admit to too much sloth, as if there could be serious consequences for admitting to her that his life was spent on the dole. Was it all her fault for telling him she was a lawyer? Had she made him afraid that she'd get him in trouble? Or that one day she might turn out to have some official power over him? Could she apologize, laughing, for her deception and start all over again? Tell him she sold computer software or clothes for the larger lady?</p> <p>A big green sign at the side of the road announced how many miles remained before Dingwall and Inverness: not very many. The land had fallen away on the left side, revealing the gleaming shore of the Cromarty Firth. The tide was low, all the rocks and sands exposed. A solitary seal languished on one of those rocks, as if stranded.</p> <p>Isserley bit her lip, slowly adjusting to her mistake. Lawyer, saleswoman, housewife: it wouldn't have made any difference. He was wrong for her, that's all. She had picked up the wrong type. Again.</p> <p>Yes, it was obvious now what this big, touchy bruiser was up to. He was going to Bradford to visit his wife, or at least his children.</p> <p>This made him a bad risk, from her point of view. Things could get very complicated when there were children involved. Much as she wanted him - it was sinking in now how much she'd already invested in the idea of having him - she didn't want complications. She would have to give him up. She would have to put him back.</p> <p>They both sat in silence for the rest of the journey, as if conscious of having let each other down.</p> <p>Traffic had accumulated all around them; they were caught up in an orderly queue of vehicles crossing the multi-laned tightrope of Kessock Bridge. Isserley glanced at her hitcher, felt a pang of loss at finding him turned away from her, staring down at the industrial estates of the Inverness shore far below. He was appraising a dismal toy-town of prefab ugliness as intently as he had admired her breasts not so long ago. Tiny trucks disappearing into factory mouths: that was what made sense to him now.</p> <p>Isserley kept to the left, drove faster than she'd done all day. It wasn't just the pace demanded by the traffic around her; she wanted to get this over with as soon as possible. The tiredness had returned with a vengeance; she longed to find a shady bower off the road, lean her head against the seat and sleep a while.</p> <p>On the far side, where the bridge rejoined the mainland, she negotiated the roundabout with pained and earnest concentration, to avoid being caught up in the town-bound traffic and herded to Inverness. She didn't even bother to disguise her grimace of anxiety as she did this: she had already lost him, after all.</p> <p>However, to fill the silence of their last few moments together, she offered him a small parting consolation.</p> <p>'I'll drive you just a bit further, get you past the Aberdeen turn-off. Then at least you'll know all the cars passing you are going south.'</p> <p>'Great, yeah,' he said passionlessly.</p> <p>'Who knows?' she jollied him. 'You might get to Bradford by tonight.'</p> <p>'Bradford?' he frowned, turning to challenge her. 'Who says I'm going to Bradford?'</p> <p>'To see your kids?' she reminded him.</p> <p>There was an awkward pause, then:</p> <p>'I never see my kids,' he stated flatly. 'I don't even know where they live, exactly. Somewhere in Bradford, that's as much as I know. Janine - my ex-wife - doesn't want anything to do with me. I don't exist anymore as far as she's concerned.' He peered straight ahead, as if roughly calculating all the thousands of places that lay south, and comparing that number to what he himself amounted to.</p> <p>'Bradford was years ago, anyway,' he said. 'She could've moved to fuckin' Mars by now, for all I know.'</p> <p>'So . . .' enquired Isserley, changing gear with such clumsiness that the gearbox made a hideous grinding noise, 'where are you hoping to get to today?'</p> <p>Her hitcher shrugged. 'Glasgow will do me,' he told her. 'There's some good pubs there.'</p> <p>Noticing her looking past him at the signs announcing imminent parking areas, it registered with him that she was about to discharge him from the car. Abruptly he mustered a last incongruous burst of conversational energy, fuelled by bitterness.</p> <p>'It beats sitting in the Commercial Hotel in Alness with a bunch of old boilers listening to some idiot singin' fuckin' ''Copacabana''.'</p> <p>'But where will you sleep?'</p> <p>'I know a couple of guys in Glasgow,' he told her, faltering again, as if that last squirt of fuel had already sputtered into the atmosphere. 'It's just a matter of running into them, that's all. They'll be there somewhere. It's a small world, eh?'</p> <p>Isserley was staring ahead at the snow-capped mountains. It looked like a pretty big world to her.</p> <p>'Mm,' she said, unable to share his vision of how Glasgow might greet him. Sensing this, he made a small mournful gesture, an opening out of his beefy hands to show there was nothing in them.</p> <p>'Although people can always let you down, eh?' he said. 'That's why you always got to have a plan B.'</p> <p>And he swallowed hard, his Adam's apple bulging like a real one stuck in his neck.</p> <p>Isserley nodded approvingly, trying not to let her feelings show. She was covered in sweat now, cold chills running down her back like electric currents. Her heart hammered so hard her breasts shook; she disciplined herself to take just one deep breath instead of many shallow ones. Keeping her right hand clamped securely to the steering wheel she checked the rear-view mirror, the other lane, her speed, the hitcher.</p> <p>Everything was ideal, everything pointed to this moment.</p> <p>Noticing her excitement, he grinned at her uncertainly, removing his hands from his lap with an awkward jerk, as if waking up, dazed, to something that might yet be expected of him. She grinned back in reassurance, nodding almost imperceptibly as if to say 'Yes'.</p> <p>Then the middle finger of her left hand flipped a little toggle on the steering wheel.</p> <p>It might have been for the headlights or the indicators, or for the windscreen wipers. It was neither. It was the icpathua toggle, the trigger for the needles inside the passenger seat, to make them spring up silently from their little sheath-like burrows in the upholstery.</p> <p>The hitcher flinched as they stung him through the fabric of his jeans, one needle in each buttock. His eyes, by chance, were facing the rear-view mirror, but no-one but Isserley witnessed the expression in them; the nearest vehicle was a giant lorry labelled FARMFOODS which was far away still, its driver an insect head behind tinted glass. In any case, the hitcher's look of surprise was momentary; the dose of icpathua was adequate for body sizes considerably larger than his. He lost consciousness and his head lolled back into the padded hollow of the headrest.</p> <p>Isserley flipped another toggle, her fingers trembling ever so slightly. The gentle tick of the indicator lights set the rhythm of her breathing as she allowed the car to drift off the road and smoothly enter the lay-by.

It was over.</p> <p>As always at this moment, she saw herself as if from a height; an aerial view of her little red Toyota parked in its little asphalt parenthesis. The FARMFOODS lorry roared past on the straight.</p> <p>Then, as always, Isserley fell from her vantage point, a dizzying drop, and plunged back into her body. Her head slammed against the headrest, quite a lot harder than his had done, and she inhaled shudderingly.

She counted her breaths, slowly getting them down to six a minute. Then she unclenched her hands from the steering wheel, laid them over her stomach. That was always oddly comforting.</p> <p>When at last the adrenaline had ebbed and she was feeling calmer, she re-applied herself to the job in hand. Vehicles were humming past from both directions, but she could only hear them, not see them. The glass of all the car's windows had turned dark amber, at the touch of a button on the dashboard. She was never aware of having touched that button; it must happen during the adrenaline rush.

She waited till it was gone.</p> <p>Then she opened the glove box and fetched out the wig. It was a wig for males, but blond and curly. She turned to the hitcher, who was still frozen in position, and placed the wig carefully on his head. She smoothed some wayward locks over his ears, pecked at the fringe with her sharp fingernails to help it settle over the forehead. She leaned back and evaluated the total effect, made some more adjustments.

      "bodyText": "Ahead of them, the sun had risen above the car's roof, leaving the windscreen filled with a harsh unpunctuated whiteness that threatened to become painful. The forest on the driver's side thinned out and was replaced by a steep embankment infested with creepers and bluebells. Signs printed in several languages unknown to Isserley reminded foreigners not to drive on the wrong side of the road. The temperature inside the car was approaching stifling, even for Isserley, who could tolerate extremes without particularly caring. Her glasses were starting to fog up, but she couldn't take them off now: he mustn't see her eyes without them. A slow, subtle trickle of perspiration ran down her neck onto her breastbone, hesitating on the brink of her cleavage. Her hitcher seemed not to notice. His hands were drumming desultorily on his inner thighs to some tune she couldn't hear; as soon as he realized she was watching, he stopped abruptly and folded his hands limply over his crotch. What on earth had happened to him? What had brought on this dismal metamorphosis? Just as she'd grown to appreciate how attractive a prospect he was, he seemed to be shrinking before her eyes; he wasn't the same male she'd taken into her car twenty minutes ago. Was he one of those inadequate lugs whose sexual self-confidence depended on not being reminded of any real females? Or was it her fault? 'You can open a window if you're too hot,' she offered. He nodded, didn't even speak. Isserley pressed her foot gingerly down on the accelerator, hoping this would please him. But he just sighed and settled further back in his seat, as if what he considered to be an insignificant increase in speed only reminded him how slowly they were getting nowhere. Maybe she shouldn't have said she was a lawyer. Maybe a shop assistant or an infant teacher would have brought him out more. It was just that she'd taken him to be a rough, robust kind of character; she'd thought he might have a criminal history he'd start to talk about, as a way of teasing her, testing her out. Maybe the only truly safe thing she could have been was a housewife. 'Your wife,' she rejoined, striving for a reassuring, companionable, male sort of tone, a tone he might expect from a drinking buddy. 'Did she get the house?' 'Yeah . . . well . . . no . . .' He drew a deep breath. 'I had to sell it, and give her half. She went to live in Bradford. I stayed on here.' 'Where's here?' she asked, nodding her head at the open road, hoping to remind him how far she had taken him already. 'Milnafua.' He sniggered, as if self-conscious about the name. To Isserley, Milnafua sounded perfectly normal; more normal in fact than London or Dundee, which she had some trouble getting her tongue round. She appreciated, however, that to him it represented some outlandish extreme. 'There's no work anywhere up there, is there,' she suggested, hoping she was striking a matter-of-fact, masculine note of sympathy. 'Don't I know it,' he mumbled. Then, with a startling boost of volume and pitch: 'Still, got to keep trying, eh?' Looking at him in disbelief, she confirmed what he was playing at: a pathetic gesture towards optimism, missing the mark by miles. He was even smiling, his face sheened with sweat, as if he'd suddenly become convinced it was dangerous to admit to too much sloth, as if there could be serious consequences for admitting to her that his life was spent on the dole. Was it all her fault for telling him she was a lawyer? Had she made him afraid that she'd get him in trouble? Or that one day she might turn out to have some official power over him? Could she apologize, laughing, for her deception and start all over again? Tell him she sold computer software or clothes for the larger lady? A big green sign at the side of the road announced how many miles remained before Dingwall and Inverness: not very many. The land had fallen away on the left side, revealing the gleaming shore of the Cromarty Firth. The tide was low, all the rocks and sands exposed. A solitary seal languished on one of those rocks, as if stranded. Isserley bit her lip, slowly adjusting to her mistake. Lawyer, saleswoman, housewife: it wouldn't have made any difference. He was wrong for her, that's all. She had picked up the wrong type. Again. Yes, it was obvious now what this big, touchy bruiser was up to. He was going to Bradford to visit his wife, or at least his children. This made him a bad risk, from her point of view. Things could get very complicated when there were children involved. Much as she wanted him - it was sinking in now how much she'd already invested in the idea of having him - she didn't want complications. She would have to give him up. She would have to put him back. They both sat in silence for the rest of the journey, as if conscious of having let each other down. Traffic had accumulated all around them; they were caught up in an orderly queue of vehicles crossing the multi-laned tightrope of Kessock Bridge. Isserley glanced at her hitcher, felt a pang of loss at finding him turned away from her, staring down at the industrial estates of the Inverness shore far below. He was appraising a dismal toy-town of prefab ugliness as intently as he had admired her breasts not so long ago. Tiny trucks disappearing into factory mouths: that was what made sense to him now. Isserley kept to the left, drove faster than she'd done all day. It wasn't just the pace demanded by the traffic around her; she wanted to get this over with as soon as possible. The tiredness had returned with a vengeance; she longed to find a shady bower off the road, lean her head against the seat and sleep a while. On the far side, where the bridge rejoined the mainland, she negotiated the roundabout with pained and earnest concentration, to avoid being caught up in the town-bound traffic and herded to Inverness. She didn't even bother to disguise her grimace of anxiety as she did this: she had already lost him, after all. However, to fill the silence of their last few moments together, she offered him a small parting consolation. 'I'll drive you just a bit further, get you past the Aberdeen turn-off. Then at least you'll know all the cars passing you are going south.' 'Great, yeah,' he said passionlessly. 'Who knows?' she jollied him. 'You might get to Bradford by tonight.' 'Bradford?' he frowned, turning to challenge her. 'Who says I'm going to Bradford?' 'To see your kids?' she reminded him. There was an awkward pause, then: 'I never see my kids,' he stated flatly. 'I don't even know where they live, exactly. Somewhere in Bradford, that's as much as I know. Janine - my ex-wife - doesn't want anything to do with me. I don't exist anymore as far as she's concerned.' He peered straight ahead, as if roughly calculating all the thousands of places that lay south, and comparing that number to what he himself amounted to. 'Bradford was years ago, anyway,' he said. 'She could've moved to fuckin' Mars by now, for all I know.' 'So . . .' enquired Isserley, changing gear with such clumsiness that the gearbox made a hideous grinding noise, 'where are you hoping to get to today?' Her hitcher shrugged. 'Glasgow will do me,' he told her. 'There's some good pubs there.' Noticing her looking past him at the signs announcing imminent parking areas, it registered with him that she was about to discharge him from the car. Abruptly he mustered a last incongruous burst of conversational energy, fuelled by bitterness. 'It beats sitting in the Commercial Hotel in Alness with a bunch of old boilers listening to some idiot singin' fuckin' ''Copacabana''.' 'But where will you sleep?' 'I know a couple of guys in Glasgow,' he told her, faltering again, as if that last squirt of fuel had already sputtered into the atmosphere. 'It's just a matter of running into them, that's all. They'll be there somewhere. It's a small world, eh?' Isserley was staring ahead at the snow-capped mountains. It looked like a pretty big world to her. 'Mm,' she said, unable to share his vision of how Glasgow might greet him. Sensing this, he made a small mournful gesture, an opening out of his beefy hands to show there was nothing in them. 'Although people can always let you down, eh?' he said. 'That's why you always got to have a plan B.' And he swallowed hard, his Adam's apple bulging like a real one stuck in his neck. Isserley nodded approvingly, trying not to let her feelings show. She was covered in sweat now, cold chills running down her back like electric currents. Her heart hammered so hard her breasts shook; she disciplined herself to take just one deep breath instead of many shallow ones. Keeping her right hand clamped securely to the steering wheel she checked the rear-view mirror, the other lane, her speed, the hitcher. Everything was ideal, everything pointed to this moment. Noticing her excitement, he grinned at her uncertainly, removing his hands from his lap with an awkward jerk, as if waking up, dazed, to something that might yet be expected of him.

      "body": "<p>Darren Johnson, the Green Party candidate for the mayor of London election, must be sick of hearing media representatives apologising for arriving by car at his campaign photo opportunities. One day last week, when Johnson attended an event organised by the campaign to ban cars from Richmond Park, the half- dozen photographers, reporters and radio journalists who were there all turned up, shame-faced, by motor.</p> <p>\"Sorry about coming by car,\" said the snapper from the local paper, who compounded her crime by leaving her Fiat alongside a sign reading: \"Strictly no parking: emergency access only.\" \"The thing is,\" she added, \"I'm well sympathetic to what you're trying to do, but I can't do my job without that thing.\"</p> <p>\"Never mind,\" smiled Johnson, using a line you sense he has employed several times a day this past month. \"I'm prepared to make a policy exception for media coverage.\"</p> <p>Not that there were many there to witness the potential embarrassment of a Green-backed campaign to ban cars apparently encouraging illegal parking. As mass grass-roots protests go, this one was not up there with Seattle. Nevertheless, undeterred, Richard Evans and John Wrepsch of the Friends of Richmond Park had gathered on their bikes at Sheen Gate, with their banner saying \"cyclists before motorists\", keen to use the moment to draw attention to the growing pollution problem in the park's glorious acres.</p> <p>\"Looking at the traffic today, you probably think I'm pulling your leg,\" John Wrepsch said as little more than a couple of cars a minute ambled through the gate. \"But you should see this place on a nice sunny Saturday, absolutely nose to tail.\"</p> <p>The two protesters explained they had alerted Darren Johnson to the cause when they happened upon him out on the streets canvassing.</p> <p>\"I saw Steve Norris in the local paper saying cars must be allowed to carry on going through the park, so I thought it would be good to get one of his rivals on our side,\" said Richard Evans. \"It could just as easily have been Ken or Susan Kramer or Dobson, but Darren was the only one I've come across.\"</p> <p>It may have been chance, but Johnson seemed the appropriate choice. He arrived at Sheen Gate travelling across the park aboard his version of David Steel's old electoral battle bus: a bike with a flag saying Vote Green fluttering out of a pannier. He was conducting an interview by mobile phone as he cycled, offering a new twist on mobile etiquette: \"Sorry, didn't quite hear that,\" he was saying, \"I'm on my bike right now.\"</p> <p>Pedalling alongside him were three members of the Johnson team, including his fund raiser, Dean Walton, who also happens to be his partner. Darren and Dean have been hard at it since last May, campaigning since the day the Greens became the first party to announce a candidate for the London race. Here's how long they've been campaigning: when they first started, Darren shared a debate platform with Jeffrey Archer.</p> <p>\"It's been brilliant,\" beamed Dean. \"We're having the time of our lives. Things are just getting better.\"</p> <p>Which is undoubtedly true. As the race has developed, one unexpected side-product has become clear: although opinion polls suggest he can muster only about 7% of the vote, Darren Johnson is likely to emerge on May 5 as the most powerful Green in British political history. Not only is he almost certain, under the proportional representation system, to gain one of the 24 seats in the Greater London Assembly for which he is also standing; not only has Ken Livingstone - should he win - promised him the chair of the environment committee; but informed gossip has it that he will be named as Livingstone's deputy.</p> <p>No wonder Darren Johnson can't stop smiling: at the politically tender age of 33, he is poised on the lip of what might be the Greens' big break through.</p> <p>\"I had a journalist on the phone two hours after Ken declared,\" Johnson grinned, \"asking me if it was true I was going to be deputy.\"</p> <p>Well? Is it?</p> <p>\"Ken's actually said he would like the other four main candidates to rotate as deputy, one a year. But it's not at all clear whether the others would buy that. We would, though.\"</p> <p>But surely there has been some discussion about the possibility, some behind-the-scenes negotiation with the favourite himself?</p> <p>\"No, honestly, there hasn't.\"</p> <p>Deal or no deputy deal, Darren Johnson does acknowledge that the Livingstone candidacy has been the best thing to happen to the Greens since the 1989 Euro elections, when the party accrued 2.5m votes. And it is not simply that Livingstone has recommended his supporters should vote Green in the assembly elections running concurrently with the mayoral race.</p> <p>\"Ken standing has completely broken down traditional party barriers,\" Johnson said. \"You only have to look at the way Steve Norris has been desperately trying to dissociate himself from the Tories to see that party perceptions are very unhelpful in this election. London just seems to be engaged in a completely different politics. I look at the papers reflecting the middle England-New Labour agenda of farmers shooting intruders and jailing asylum seekers and I sometimes think I'm reading about another country.\"</p> <p>The Daily Telegraph seems to regard him not so much as an inhabitant of another country as a threat from another planet. In an interview in the paper yesterday, Johnson was depicted as a revolutionary seeking to ban everything from the World Trade Organisation to the monarchy.</p> <p>\"The journalist kept asking me what I believed on all sorts of things,\" Johnson explained. \"I was happy to tell him even though I kept spelling out that the GLA really won't have any responsibility for areas like the monarchy.\"</p> <p>On the subject of the Telegraph's fear of revolutionary activity, was Johnson planning to be outside Westminster yesterday, digging up the pavement and planting rhubarb in the name of \"guerrilla gardening\"?</p> <p>\"No, I'll be at Alexandra Palace at the last mayoral hustings,\" he said. \"Actually, I took the whole Telegraph thing as a compliment. I think it shows that we are a far bigger threat to the forces of conservatism than Blairite values are. It also adds to what I was saying about the way London is growing apart politically from the rest of the country.\"</p> <p>Johnson has a point here. There has been a sense, at the myriad public meetings where they sit together on the platform, first- naming each other promiscuously, that the mayoral candidates have formed a little party of their own, colleagues rather than rivals. And Darren Johnson is keen for it to be known he is right in there.</p> <p>\"Oh God, we know each other backwards,\" he said. \"We know each other's speeches, each other's jokes. In fact, at one meeting, I didn't hear a question from the floor. I was sitting next to Steve [Norris], so I asked him what the question was. He not only told me, he gave me the Green Party policy on the issue.\"</p> <p>But what really excites Johnson about this election is that since the mayor's limited powers will coalesce around the Green agenda - public transport, rubbish recycling, cycle routes - he may well be in a position, once the votes have been counted, to deliver important party promises.</p> <p>\"When I first started canvassing for the Greens back in 1987, you could tell people thought of us as a bit abstract, you know, campaigning to save the whales. Now people are worried about traffic jams and children's asthma, and the environment is not seen as some good cause but a major part of the quality of life. So my 10-second doorstep spiel is: if you want to improve everyday life, my name's on the right-hand side of the yellow ballot paper.\"</p> <p>As Johnson spoke, behind him in Richmond Park the practicalities of modern protest were coming into play. John Repsch had decided it might make a picture if all six cyclists, in a strategic piece of direct action, blocked the traffic at Richmond Gate. Johnson agreed, a risky strategy, you couldn't help feeling, jeopardising a few dozen votes at least in any ensuing jam. And so - the Green contingent by bike, the media by motor (\"I would walk,\" the Guardian's photographer explained, \"but I've got all this stuff\") - everyone decamped across the park.</p> <p>Here things did not quite turn out as planned. Despite Repsch's assurance that \"no bugger in a car ever stops for a cyclist\", the first driver we met at Richmond Gate halted and cheerily waved the protesters across the road. In the face of such politeness, nobody really had the stomach for mass protest. And so instead it was decided to repair to the pub.</p> <p>\"The one thing I've been really pleased about during this campaign is that we've managed to raise the profile of the Greens,\" said Johnson. \"Yesterday, a woman came up to me and said she recognised me off the telly. That's never happened in Green politics before.\"</p>",

His work on the original production of Jesus Christ Superstar helped create the mega-musical, a phenomenon he now laments.

For all that, Thomson argues that the current production, which stars Elaine Paige and US film actor Jason Scott Lee, need offend neither political nor aesthetic principles. Not that most punters care. The production has taken \u00a38m in advance ticket sales. </p> <p>Padding around his Soho flat in a King and I sweatshirt, the personable 54-year-old uber-designer recalls his response to being summoned for the production. \"I said I didn't really think it was my cup of tea.\" So what changed his mind? \"I had been working in Thailand on a couple of films, and I really loved the place. And I feel that Australians - much as we try to be a western enclave - are part of Asia. I think in 10, 20 years' time it'll be an Asian country. It's extraordinary to be Australian, living with hundreds of millions of people whose beliefs are so different to ours. I think that is somehow dealt with in The King and I.\" </p> <p>His job enabled Thomson to redress some of the glaring problems of the earlier incarnations. \"To be fair to the world when it was first done, Thailand was a long way away. Asia was anywhere from Turkey to Japan, and the original productions would take anything from any of those places. What I've done is taken elements from Thai architecture and Siamese ideas and theatricalised them.\" The results won Thomson a Tony Award for the show's Broadway production. But he is eager to point out that his designs are not there to draw attention to themselves. The designer's job is \"to provide a world in which the story can be told\". </p> <p>So dedicated is Thomson to stories, he even tried to locate them in the oeuvre of Kylie Minogue, whose Intimate &amp; Live tour he designed. \"You're still dealing with ideas: how Kylie might do Better the Devil You Know is as tough an assignment as how you stage Getting to Know You in The King and I.\" </p> <p>He shakes his head sadly when confronted with the irony that it was his \"Brechtian, stripped-back\" 1971 production of Jesus Christ Superstar that helped launch the design-heavy macro- musical. \"I think Superstar is a much better show than the others. I'm not in the same position as a lot of other people who rely on Lloyd Webber for their future. I couldn't care less. I think Andrew has been so, so, so lucky to have truly wonderful productions done of very wispy little thin shows.\" Well, wonderful with a few exceptions: \"Sunset Boulevard - what was all that about? Who wants a big house that goes up and down? It's just stupid. I think your spine should be tingling from the storytelling, and I think you can do that on a bare stage.\" It's no wonder that Thomson decries the fashion for identikit theatrical blockbusters.

Memories are still sore at the cheek of the Liberal Democrat council, which abandoned Torquay's flowerbeds last year as a cost-cutting measure. By the standards of the resort, the sight of unplanted flower beds was a blunder which could cost the Lib Dems dear in Thursday's elections. Eileen Salloway, who is standing as a Tory, thundered: \"It was appalling. As a tourist resort they are our shop window. The council has replanted the flowers, but that's only because it's election year.\" For the Tories, who have high hopes of regaining Torbay district council which takes in Torquay, Paignton and Brixham, the Lib Dems' behaviour over the beloved tulips is a powerful illustration of why such upstarts are unfit to run the \"English Riviera\" along the Devon coast. Torbay was once solidly true blue, thanks to affluent retired residents who make up nearly half the population. The unthinkable happened in 1991 when the Lib Dems wrested control of the council.

Desperate to avoid being pushed into third or even fourth place in Thursday's voting, Mr Dobson said that Mr Johnson's plans to introduce a \u00a33,000 a year charge for company car parking space exposes the \"marriage of extremism\" between the Greens and the independent Livingstone campaign. Mr Johnson is running for mayor on the Green ticket. But he could be appointed Mr Livingstone's deputy if the front-runner clinches his expected victory after a second round play-off against the Tory candidate, Steve Norris, whom Mr Dobson also lambasted yesterday. Mr Livingstone's past remarks in support of anti-capitalist demonstrations which ended in violence in both Seattle and the City gave him a tactical headache as fresh protests occurred in London. He resolved the dilemma by lying low, and issuing the text of a pro-City speech he plans to make at a City award ceremony tonight. In his bid to soothe the fears of the financial markets if he wins, Mr Livingstone promised the City to campaign for British membership of the eurozone and to use its expertise to develop London's global role. Predicting that a \"major crisis may greet the mayor at Dagenham,\" Mr Livingstone said the car industry's crisis was not the fault of London business or of Ford but of the high pound. In a signal of clashes to come, Mr Livingstone's text confirmed: \"I don't agree with the government's attitude on the euro.\" He promised to campaign for entry as mayor. Mr Livingstone said the aboliton of the Greater London Council by Margaret Thatcher had hit the City as well as London as a whole. Mr Dobson staged a press conference with families of victims of the 1990 Marchioness riverboat disaster to highlight Mr Norris's failure to order an inquiry into the sinking during his time as transport minister. Mr Norris is running second in the polls. \"Our experience of dealing with Mr Norris means that we know he is not fit to be mayor,\" said Barbara Davies, mother of one victim. Labour granted an inquiry into the incident, the results of which were accepted this year. Yesterday Mr Norris promised an urgent assessment of riverbank safety equipment. \u0095In a separate development Peter Tatchell, who is running for the Greater London authority, announced that he has written to President Mugabe of Zimbabwe, whom he tried to have arrested in London for his homophobic comments. Mr Tatchell wrote: \"Although my citizen's arrest of you last October failed, the next attempt will succeed. \"If you ever return to Britain, you will be liable to arrest on charges of torture - not by me, but by the Metropolitan police.\" Mr Tatchell believes such an arrest would have the support of the GLA police authority on which he hopes to sit.",
