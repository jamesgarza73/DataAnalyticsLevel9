That was how City had set about unhinging Premiership opposition Tottenham and Newcastle in previous rounds and on this occasion they initially found the tables turned. Accustomed to teams coming to St Andrews and defending, City were taken by surprise as the visitors took the game to them. So much so that it was not until midway through the first period that the Wednesday keeper Kevin Pressman was first seriously inconvenienced. Gerald Sibon served notice of Wednesday's intention as early as the first minute when he tried his luck from 35 yards after his side were awarded a free kick. The City keeper Ian Bennett remained untroubled because of the intervention of his side's defensive wall but he had to be at his best to stop the visitors taking the lead seven minutes later. The City keeper was in action again in the 20th minute this time diving to his left to smother a long range cross shot from Owen Morrison. By contrast Pressman was almost a peripheral figure at the other end as Wednesday's direct approach resulted in them almost continually occupying City territory.

      "body": "<p>Every time I write as a dance critic I work on the assumption that the rhythms, shapes and postures of bodies have significant meaning. Yet we tend to imagine that doctors and scientists take a different view. For them, surely, the ghost has abandoned the machine, leaving an abstract puzzle of tissue and organs laid out on a table. For them, surely, bodies have no poetry, no stories to tell other than the physiological. </p> <p>Certainly, that's the first impression delivered by Spectacular Bodies, the sometimes bizarre, often wonderful history of the art and science of the human body at London's Hayward Gallery. The first room is hung with 17th and 18th- century portraits portraying a powerful scientific establishment wielding its scalpels over the inert, defenceless flesh of the dead. As the all-male surgeons gaze from the walls, sleek and smug with their own well-being, they graphically disclaim any human alliance with the pallid lumps of meat they're carving up. </p> <p>But another view has been left behind by the artists who often worked for the medical profession from the Renaissance onwards, sketching and modelling organs, severed limbs and bones for research and education.

      "bodyText": "Every time I write as a dance critic I work on the assumption that the rhythms, shapes and postures of bodies have significant meaning. Yet we tend to imagine that doctors and scientists take a different view. For them, surely, the ghost has abandoned the machine, leaving an abstract puzzle of tissue and organs laid out on a table. For them, surely, bodies have no poetry, no stories to tell other than the physiological. Certainly, that's the first impression delivered by Spectacular Bodies, the sometimes bizarre, often wonderful history of the art and science of the human body at London's Hayward Gallery. The first room is hung with 17th and 18th- century portraits portraying a powerful scientific establishment wielding its scalpels over the inert, defenceless flesh of the dead. As the all-male surgeons gaze from the walls, sleek and smug with their own well-being, they graphically disclaim any human alliance with the pallid lumps of meat they're carving up. But another view has been left behind by the artists who often worked for the medical profession from the Renaissance onwards, sketching and modelling organs, severed limbs and bones for research and education. These beautiful, efficient objects present the body alive or dead as an object of awe: here are minutely fashioned skeletons displaying the exquisite architecture of bones, sculptures exposing the abstract patterns of musculature beneath flayed skin, organs and blood vessels reproduced with gaudy waxen realism. Many of the modellers crafted one half of a handsome physique or a pretty face while exposing the often gory substructure of the other half, and this double vision was infectious.

Both organisations stress the need to hold tight to their founders' original focus throughout the current change process and in all future plans. \"A key cornerstone of Unique has been its human face,\" said Mr Barrett. \"It's absolutely critical and we must never lose that.\" \u0095 Kate Wilkinson is a communications consultant",

Are staff up-to-date with the latest clinical developments? Are junior staff properly supervised? Do the hospitals know how well they treat patients - and are they comparing themselves with similar hospitals? Do patients feel fully informed about their treatment? </p> <p>These may seem obvious issues, but it is only recently that the NHS has had a legal duty to guarantee the quality of care it provides. For a long time, trust boards concentrated on how much treatment they were providing and what it was costing, with an assumption that quality was being looked after. </p> <p>The three hospitals we report on today are well run; they all have areas that demonstrate very good practice in the health service; and they all have aspects that need improvement. In writing the reports, we have tried to present a picture of the hospitals that their local communities and staff would recognise. </p> <p>Unsurprisingly, these pictures are a blend of strength and areas for improvement. My hope is that, in conveying our reports to local communities, local news and broadcast journalists will reflect that balance. </p> <p>Each of the hospitals we report on today has produced a comprehensive action plan to address the issues the report raises. These action plans are very important. They give local people a way of being sure that the hospitals have taken our reports seriously and are doing something about them. </p> <p>But it should not only be the staff of those hospitals and their communities who are interested in today's reports. </p> <p>I hope that people everywhere will read them and use them to ask questions about their local health services and what they are doing to improve the quality of care they offer to patients. I also hope that health service staff across the country use them to help assess their own care of patients. </p> <p>The commission has set out a bold aim - to bring about demonstrable improvement in patient care in the NHS. Our first three reports represent a major force for that improvement. </p> <p>&amp;#149: Peter Homa is chief executive of the commission for health improvement</p>",

      "bodyText": "I have a vision where, in four years' time, when a patient is sent by a GP for a hospital appointment, they will know that an independent assessment has been made of that hospital and that the report is available to the public. For hospitals in Chesterfield, Southampton and Sunderland, that vision is a now a reality. Today, the commission for health improvement publishes the reports of its reviews of those hospitals - the beginning of a four-year programme of reviews that will cover every hospital, health authority, primary care trust and NHS trust in England and Wales. The reports look at the issues that affect the quality of care patients receive, asking key questions. Are staff up-to-date with the latest clinical developments? Are junior staff properly supervised? Do the hospitals know how well they treat patients - and are they comparing themselves with similar hospitals? Do patients feel fully informed about their treatment? These may seem obvious issues, but it is only recently that the NHS has had a legal duty to guarantee the quality of care it provides. For a long time, trust boards concentrated on how much treatment they were providing and what it was costing, with an assumption that quality was being looked after. The three hospitals we report on today are well run; they all have areas that demonstrate very good practice in the health service; and they all have aspects that need improvement. In writing the reports, we have tried to present a picture of the hospitals that their local communities and staff would recognise. Unsurprisingly, these pictures are a blend of strength and areas for improvement. My hope is that, in conveying our reports to local communities, local news and broadcast journalists will reflect that balance. Each of the hospitals we report on today has produced a comprehensive action plan to address the issues the report raises. These action plans are very important. They give local people a way of being sure that the hospitals have taken our reports seriously and are doing something about them. But it should not only be the staff of those hospitals and their communities who are interested in today's reports. I hope that people everywhere will read them and use them to ask questions about their local health services and what they are doing to improve the quality of care they offer to patients. I also hope that health service staff across the country use them to help assess their own care of patients. The commission has set out a bold aim - to bring about demonstrable improvement in patient care in the NHS. Our first three reports represent a major force for that improvement. \u2022: Peter Homa is chief executive of the commission for health improvement",

The government's housing green paper earlier this year proposed that registered social landlords (RSLs) should only be allowed to increase rents in line with inflation. After lobbying from housing associations, however, a government housing policy statement unveiled today promises increases of 0.5% above inflation, a figure that could prove crucial in keeping some landlords out of the red. By reigning in rents, ministers hope to bring housing association and council charges more closely into line. At present, local government rents are around 15% lower than those of social landlords. Council charges will rise at a \"slightly quicker\" rate than those allowed to RSLs, the policy statement says. This will give authorities the chance to catch up with housing associations, although ministers say a gap of between 5-10% is likely to remain between association and council rents. The government's housing policy statement also contains a new formula for setting social rents, replacing the currently inconsistent range of charges across the country. This will place a 30% weight on local property prices, a 70% emphasis on local earnings and take into account the size of properties. This is likely to mean decreasing rents in the north, and an increase in London and the south. The government proposes to dampen the effect of the changes by limiting rent changes to an annual \u00a32 a week above inflation and compensating tenants through housing benefit.

The reviews were not just discordant, they were flatly contradictory: while some hailed a masterpiece, others castigated a piece of muck-raking.</p> <p> <strong>Adam Mars-Jones</strong>, in the <strong>Observer</strong>, condemned the book as a literary hatchet-job. \"Saul Bellow, like any biographical subject, has feet of clay, knees of clay, hips of clay, but there is an incongruous element of resentment in Atlas's recording of his flaws,\" wrote Mars-Jones. \"Balanced literary judgments alternate with a sort of character assassination by degrees.\"</p> <p> Nor was he convinced by Atlas's explanation for Bellow's philandering: \"Bellow's private life is spectacularly messy, with four failed marriages, three compromised relationships with sons, periods of cranky therapy and plentiful adulteries. A fair-sized volume could be compiled exclusively from his vengeful fictional versions of ex-wives ... Atlas has a simple explanation for his subject's failures as a husband: the early death of Bellow's mother, before he had achieved independence from her, prevented him from forging mature relationships. This is a peculiarly reductive analysis, quite apart from the fact that the death of a boy's parent when he's 17 doesn't exactly qualify as childhood trauma.\"</p> <p> Mars-Jones's best putdown concerned Atlas's methodology: \"In his acknowledgements, Atlas thanks his assistant, Adam Kirsh, for having 'laboured to make my somewhat impressionistic citations credible'. 'Impressionistic' in a biography sits next to 'citations' as comfortably as 'juggling' next to 'nitroglycerine'.\" A neat aphorism.</p> <p> There was an equally explosive attack on the book by <strong>Richard Poirier</strong> in the <strong>London Review of Books</strong>. \"[Atlas's] sense of the life is on the whole censorious, flat-minded and peremptory,\" insisted Poirier. \"Errors and confusions abound, as do misreadings of passages from Bellow's correspondence, while passages from his novels never receive the benefit of close interpretation or stylistic commentary.\"</p> <p> The timing of the review was interesting: the LRB is usually happy to produce its lengthy critiques some months after books have appeared, but in this instance they leapt in ahead of the national press with a pre-emptive strike by an American critic who spent a large part of his review explaining his own relationship to Bellow and arguing that Atlas's mistaken belief that he (Poirier) was Jewish demonstrated just how hopeless the book was. </p> <p> In the following issue, Atlas made a terse reply in the magazine's letters column suggesting that an unflattering portrait of Poirier in Herzog, Bellow's best-known book, might have influenced the review and should, at least, have been declared. All mildly entertaining in showing up the interminable squabbles of literary critics (the Herzog spat dates back 35 years), but not terribly helpful in determining whether Atlas had faithfully mapped Bellow's life and work. </p> <p> <strong>Paul Bailey</strong>, in the <strong>Sunday Times</strong>, believed he had. \"This biography is not a book designed for the prurient,\" argued Bailey. \"Atlas is a serious writer, not some dabbler in tittle-tattle. He understands that the novelist's strained relationships with the chosen 'girls' have provided Bellow with much necessary material ... Atlas never loses sight of the fact that he is dealing with the complex life of a writer of genius.\"</p> <p> <strong>Hywel Williams</strong>, in the <strong>Guardian</strong>, agreed. \"Atlas combines scholarship with empathy,\" wrote Williams. \"No life can 'explain' art, but the fiction of the 'dangling man' has been so insistently biographical that it cries out for an account as lucid as this. The making of Bellow is a many-layered thing, and it's all here: the Talmudic ancestors in Tsarist Russia; Abraham reading Chekhov's stories in Yiddish to his sons; Montreal, where the child of the immigrant family spoke French on the streets and read Genesis in Hebrew at home. And, of course, Chicago, where the family finally settled.\"</p> <p> <strong>George Walden</strong>, in the <strong>London Evening Standard</strong>, went further, calling the book \"a biographical tour de force, a sustained literary treat untainted by sensationalism\". \"Bellow has had a rich and motley life, especially sexually,\" wrote Walden. \"Atlas charts it with great intellectual verve, and few biographies pull you along with the force of this one. The book sparkles with incident and intelligence. Atlas's prose is lively yet reflective, and the text is studded on almost every page with some superbly crafted Bellovian sentence or casual witticism.\"</p> <p> <strong>Ian Hamilton</strong>, in the <strong>Sunday Telegraph</strong>, managed to occupy the middle ground: admiring Atlas's attempt to portray both man and novelist, while doubting whether he had squared the circle of Bellow's complex character. \"Some Bellow traits he finds impossible to fathom,\" wrote Hamilton. \"How can it be, for instance, that this lauded and prize-laden writer cannot rid himself of the belief that he is underrated? How can such a street-smart, free-style humorist be bothered to sustain so many life-long enmities, go to such lengths to avenge himself in print? And what about the life-long friends who regularly turn up in his novels, but in unflattering portrayals? Does this author have no loyalties, no qualms?</p> <p> \"One of the chief strengths of Atlas's shrewd and readable biography is that he allows so many of the novelist's real-life models to speak up for themselves. This testimony tends to be resentful. At the same time, though, much of it is simply glum and baffled. Trying to understand Saul Bellow has proved too much for most of his associates, it seems, and James Atlas, we suspect, knows how they feel.\" </p> <p> A cleverly ambiguous conclusion.

When he sold his 11% share in the club in 1998 he came away with $15.4m (\u00a310.5m) on an original investment of $600,000, clearly demonstrating that his reward was to be on earth as well as in heaven.</p> <p>Now Mr Bush and the Rangers are sharing the front pages again, and once again it is money that is talking. The Rangers have just signed the baseball player Alex Rodriguez for an astonishing $252m, for 10 years\u0090 service from the 25-year-old. This is big money even by the standards of the golfer Tiger Woods and the tennis star Pete Sampras and surpasses deals done with the basketball players Kevin Garnett ($126m for six years) and Shaquille O'Neal ($120m for seven years).</p> <p>Some fans claim that such enormous sums will be the death of baseball, just as many fans have seen the vast transfer fees killing off the poorer football clubs in Europe. They have attacked Scott Boras, the agent who negotiates such fees, as the Great Satan, just as football managers loathe the wide-boy agents who negotiate much more modest deals for their clients.</p> <p>Rodriguez, who wept as he played his last game for the Seattle Mariners, will pick up a $10m signing-on fee and an annual salary of between $21m and $27m, better even than the deal Governor Bush got from the Rangers club - even if Rodriguez does have do some running around for it.</p> <p>But the deal does draw attention back to the way Mr Bush made his big money out of the club. In her unauthorised biography of him, entitled Shrub, the Texas journalist Molly Ivins demonstrates how he and his associates benefited from a land deal that gave the club its park.</p> <p>\"Hillary Clinton had done a far smaller deal on commodities futures in the 1970s,\" writes Ms Ivins, \"and the east coast press stopped just short of appointing its own special prosecutor to look into allegations that she was trading on her influence as the wife of the governor of Arkansas.\"</p> <p>How different, she suggests, was the way that Mr Bush benefited from the assistance of Texas taxpayers to come home with his remarkable windfall.</p> <p>Mr Bush has had a remarkably easy ride in the race for the presidency, considering his record in Texas, his dodging of active service when other young men were dying in Vietnam, his dissembling about his drink driving and the \"lost years\" about which he said: \"When I was young and foolish, I was young and foolish.\"</p> <p>This is the man who says Jesus is the political philosopher he admires most, and who has executed a record number of Texans and even mocked the clemency pleas of one, Karla Faye Tucker.</p> <p>But as Ms Ivins suggests, \"our boy is always hurt, surprised and indignant when others attack him. He\u0090s such an affable fellow, ever uttering anodyne platitudes, the only way to get any real sense of him is through his record.\"</p> <p><b>Email</b><br> <a href=\"mailto:duncan.campbell@theguardian.com\"> duncan.campbell@theguardian.com</a></p> <p><b>Related special report</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/usguns/0,2759,182056,00.html\">Gun violence in America</a></p> <p><b>Other articles</b><br> <a href=\" http://www.searchunlimited.co.uk/search97cgi/s97networkr_cgi?QueryText=%28duncan+campbell%29AND+%28VdkPublicationDate+%3E%3D+01%2DSep%2D1998%29&amp;ResultColSize=2000&amp;ResultTemplate=ArchiveFull%2Ehts&amp;Collection=archive&amp;SortSpec=score+Desc&amp;Query=duncan+campbell&amp;ResultStart=1&amp;ResultCount=10&amp;ResultMaxDocs=1000&amp;Dtv=\">More articles by Duncan Campbell</a></p> <p><b>Key rulings</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.supremecourtus.gov/florida.html\" target=\"_new\">US supreme court rulings </a><br> <a href=\"http://www.flcourts.org/pubinfo/election/index.html\" target=\"_new\">Florida supreme court rulings</a></p> <p><b>Related stories</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,410896,00.html\">What the US papers say</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,410902,00.html\">Jonathan Freedland: The day America's judges became politicians</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,399153,00.html\">Timeline</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,398516,00.html\">Election glossary</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/graphic/0,5543,398700,00.html\">Graphic: Know your chad</a><br></p> <p><b>Photo gallery</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/gall/0,8542,409877,00.html\">After the vote, before the ruling</a></p> <p><b>Interactive</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/flash/0,5543,394350,00.html\">Results declared, state by state</a></p> <p><b>Local media</b> <br> <a href=\"http://www.herald.com/\" target=\"_new\">Miami Herald</a><br><a href=\"http://www.tdo.com/\" target=\"_new\">Tallahassee Democrat</a><br><a href=\"http://www.gopbi.com/partners/pbpost/epaper/editions/today/\" target=\"_new\">Palm Beach Post</a><br><a href=\"http://www.sun-sentinel.com/\">Sun Sentinel</a><br><a href=\"http://www.sptimes.com/\" target=\"_new\">St Petersburg Times</a><br><a href=\"http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Index&amp;Title_Request=IX#TitleIX\" target=\"_new\">Key Florida statutes</a></p>",

Now Mr Bush and the Rangers are sharing the front pages again, and once again it is money that is talking. The Rangers have just signed the baseball player Alex Rodriguez for an astonishing $252m, for 10 years\u0090 service from the 25-year-old. This is big money even by the standards of the golfer Tiger Woods and the tennis star Pete Sampras and surpasses deals done with the basketball players Kevin Garnett ($126m for six years) and Shaquille O'Neal ($120m for seven years). Some fans claim that such enormous sums will be the death of baseball, just as many fans have seen the vast transfer fees killing off the poorer football clubs in Europe. They have attacked Scott Boras, the agent who negotiates such fees, as the Great Satan, just as football managers loathe the wide-boy agents who negotiate much more modest deals for their clients. Rodriguez, who wept as he played his last game for the Seattle Mariners, will pick up a $10m signing-on fee and an annual salary of between $21m and $27m, better even than the deal Governor Bush got from the Rangers club - even if Rodriguez does have do some running around for it. But the deal does draw attention back to the way Mr Bush made his big money out of the club. In her unauthorised biography of him, entitled Shrub, the Texas journalist Molly Ivins demonstrates how he and his associates benefited from a land deal that gave the club its park. \"Hillary Clinton had done a far smaller deal on commodities futures in the 1970s,\" writes Ms Ivins, \"and the east coast press stopped just short of appointing its own special prosecutor to look into allegations that she was trading on her influence as the wife of the governor of Arkansas.\" How different, she suggests, was the way that Mr Bush benefited from the assistance of Texas taxpayers to come home with his remarkable windfall. Mr Bush has had a remarkably easy ride in the race for the presidency, considering his record in Texas, his dodging of active service when other young men were dying in Vietnam, his dissembling about his drink driving and the \"lost years\" about which he said: \"When I was young and foolish, I was young and foolish.\" This is the man who says Jesus is the political philosopher he admires most, and who has executed a record number of Texans and even mocked the clemency pleas of one, Karla Faye Tucker. But as Ms Ivins suggests, \"our boy is always hurt, surprised and indignant when others attack him. He\u0090s such an affable fellow, ever uttering anodyne platitudes, the only way to get any real sense of him is through his record.\" Email duncan.campbell@theguardian.com Related special report Gun violence in America Other articles More articles by Duncan Campbell Key rulings US supreme court rulings Florida supreme court rulings Related stories What the US papers say Jonathan Freedland: The day America's judges became politicians Timeline Election glossary Graphic: Know your chad Photo gallery After the vote, before the ruling Interactive Results declared, state by state Local media Miami Herald Tallahassee Democrat Palm Beach Post Sun Sentinel St Petersburg Times Key Florida statutes",

It is the most difficult draw we could possibly have had and it will be a massive task for us to overcome them,\" Liverpool manager Gerard Houllier whined through gritted teeth as his club were paired with the current leaders of Serie A. \"Roma are certainly one of the best teams in Europe at the moment with their Gabriel Batistuta - Francesco Totti attack the best on the continent,\" chief executive Rick Parry chimed in, using phraseology which wouldn't be out of place in a regional newsreader's screen test.</p> <p>But it wasn't all bad news for the crisis club, even though Roma sporting director Antonio Tempestilli was heard yelling \"Revenge for 1984!\" like a murderous nut. The crucial second leg should have been played in the Olympic Stadium in Rome on February 22, but because Lazio are playing Real Madrid there in Big Cup the day before, the ties had to be switched. And should Gerard Houllier's men fluke a result against the Serie A leaders, they'll have an easier match against Porto or Nantes in the quarter-finals!

The Fiver can testify that catching the fish is definitely weirder, as the Pope is often at a loose end on weeknights. But neither, and we mean neither, is as weird as listening to a high-ranking Uefa executive going on about how Big Cup is too big. Yet that is exactly what has happened.</p> <p>\"I'm convinced [Big Cup] is too long and the fixture list is saturated. We don't want people to get bored and it's important the competitions are interesting.\" Those are the words of Gerhard Aigner, director general of Uefa, ahead of a meeting of their executive committee tomorrow. \"We aren't going to immediately reform [Big Cup] or [Euro Vase] but must consider it at some time,\" he went on as the assembled crowds swooned. Aigner, after a quick whiff of his armpits just to check, disappeared swiftly inside.</p> <p>The cynic in the Fiver is of the mind that, if Uefa are openly willing to talk about reforming something they only created last year, then it must be seriously bell-ended.

The shock departure of the former ITV golden boy comes less than a year after he was poached by the satellite broadcaster. Mr Bergg joined BSkyB from ITV, where he was director of planning and strategy. The hiring was seen as a major coup, with Mr Bergg widely regarded as the best scheduler in the country. Mr Bergg saw the move as fulfilling his desire to become a bone fide channel controller, commissioning programmes as well as scheduling. But he is thought not to have fit in to BSkyB's corporate culture, which is regarded to be more commercial and aggressive than ITV. Earlier in the year he had talked of plans to poach BBC1 and ITV stars and reposition Sky One's programming to target the two mainstream entertainment channels' broad audience profiles. Mr Bergg spoke of targeting the \"Sunny Delight audience - families with parents in their 30s or 40s who read Nick Hornby and Bridget Jones\". He previously worked as a scheduler at Channel 5, BBC1 and GMTV before moving to ITV. It is understood that severance terms are currently being negotiated with an announcement expected to follow.

      "bodyText": "Railtrack's troubles deepened today after it was accused by MPs of having lost sight of its \"core responsibility\" to run a safe and efficient railway in the run up to the Hatfield crash. The Commons Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs Committee castigated the management of the beleaguered rail infrastructure company for \"systematic, often-repeated failings\" which had led to one crisis after another. In a scathing report, it warned that the \"cosmetic re-shuffling\" of the board, following the resignation of the chief executive, Gerald Corbett, in the wake of Hatfield, would not solve Railtrack's deep-seated problems. The report, one of the most searing indictments of a private company by a Commons committee, highlighted failings at every level of the organisation and called for a radical shake-up of the senior management. It followed remarks from the prime minister, Tony Blair, last night which described travelling on the railways at the moment as \"absolute hell\". The report said: \"Railtrack has, it seems, staggered from one crisis to another in recent years. \"As a private company, Railtrack, and ultimately its shareholders, should acknowledge that crises are not simply the result of unforeseen outside events such as accidents or 'local failures', but are indicative of systematic, often-repeated failings in the company's management systems and leadership which the resignation of the chief executive and the cosmetic re-shuffling of the board will not resolve.\" The MPs strongly criticised the composition of the Railtrack board, with only two of the seven executive directors having had significant experience of working in the rail industry, while just one was a qualified engineer. \"It suggests that the company had previously lost sight of the fact that its core responsibility is to run a safe and efficient railway, and that to do so requires directors and managers with appropriate experience,\" the report said. It said the appointment of the only engineer on the board, the commercial director, Richard Middleton, to the new post of technical director did not go far enough and that more senior people were needed with \"knowledge and experience appropriate for running the railway\". Railtrack's management of the contractors, Balfour Beatty, who were responsible for maintenance on the East Coast Main Line where the Hatfield crash occurred, had been \"totally inadequate\", the report said. The decision to institute such an extensive programme of track inspections after the Hatfield crash, leading to widespread line closures and speed restrictions, suggested that Railtrack lacked confidence in the way its system of outside maintenance contractors had been managed. Even now, the report said, there were still concerns that some contractors had proved either unable, or unwilling, to adopt best practice in maintaining the railway. The MPs said Railtrack had failed to ensure that the new safety culture now espoused by its senior management was shared by its contractors, sub-contractors and frontline workers on the railway. The report also strongly criticised the way Railtrack managers shut down the whole of the West Coast Main Line from Carlisle to Glasgow, without warning, leaving thousands of commuters stranded. \"The decision to close the West Coast Main Line on October 25, and the way in which that decision was reached, are indicative of poor communications between layers of management in Railtrack, an inability on the part of the company to see its activities and responsibilities in a wider context and shows scant regard for public interest,\" it said.

      "body": "<p>The recently reported death of two teenage girls in a gas-filled car is deeply shocking. Why would two young women, we wonder, choose to die in a suicide pact? Sadly, though, teenage suicide is not rare. After 1945, the rate of teenage suicide around the world began to rise significantly. In more recent years, the rate for young women has levelled out. The rate for young men, however, has continued to rise, possibly because many, faced with a dearth of traditional jobs and roles for men, have felt that society had no place for them. </p> <p>The legal tradition has been to regard suicide as an act committed when the balance of the mind is disturbed - that is, as a permanent or temporary madness. This formulation does not, of course, explain why a person commits suicide. Suicidal thoughts are considered to be a symptom of depression, but while all depressed people contemplate suicide as a way of escaping their misery, not all depressed people even attempt suicide; and it is by no means certain that everyone who commits suicide is depressed. What is possible is to explain suicide in terms of what it is to be a person. </p> <p>Each of us is keenly aware of being a person, that which we each call I, myself. This sense of being a person is made up of a structure of all our ideas, attitudes, opinions, memories and feelings. Within this structure are some central ideas about who we are and what our moral stance must be. Our sense of being a person is what we hold most dear, and our every decision and action is aimed in part at preserving our being that person. </p> <p>But we also strive to survive as a physical body. For most of our lives, surviving as a person and as a body go together. A situation can arise, though, where we have to sacrifice one or the other. Suppose, as a loving parent, you find yourself and your child in some dangerous situation where only one of you can survive. Do you sacrifice yourself or your child? Your choice is simple. You die in order that your child will live. You sacrifice your body in order to continue being what you value most, a loving parent. You know that if you chose otherwise and lived while your child died, you would have failed yourself. This may seem an extreme example, and yet the mechanism is common: many of the people who suffer depression or post-traumatic stress disorder after a disaster believe that the only way they could have continued to be the person they once valued would have been to have died in the disaster. </p> <p>Some people abandon their bodies when they realise that the world no longer offers them the supports they know are essential to the maintenance of themselves as a person. Some of them simply lose the will to live. Others contract a survivable illness and yet die. Research shows that a significant number of widowers (though, curiously, not widows) die within a year of their wives' deaths. </p> <p>The will to live can be very strong, and so some people who feel that their situation will not allow them to be themselves choose to kill their body in order to be the person they know themselves to be. If they cannot live as themselves, they will die as themselves. In killing themselves, they leave a message to the world at large and to some, if not all, of their nearest and dearest. Their written message might be: \"You will be better off without me.\" But the subtext is: \"You have failed to be what I wanted you to be.\" Many of the parents of teenage suicides understand that this is the message and torture themselves with guilt. </p> <p>Guilt is very familiar to parents, aware that none of us is perfect. Teenagers, suicidal or not, make life difficult for parents precisely because children are reluctant to accept that they have less than perfect parents. Part of the process of growing up is learning to accept the fallibility of our parents and the impossibility of the world ever being what we want it to be. When we are teenagers everything matters enormously. Yet in life things rarely turn out the way we expect. We come to accept compromise as wisdom, rather than as a betrayal of ideals. Adults can help teenagers arrive at such wisdom by listening and discussing, while refraining from criticism and instruction. </p> <p>One common feature of teenage suicide is that the young person felt that there was no one who would listen. The Samaritans offer a special service to teenagers who find they have no one to talk to. Listening to your children is not easy, because you will hear a great deal that you may wish you had not heard, chiefly accounts of your shortcomings. But if you find you can, then you will have given your children the greatest gift: the gift of being listened to and accepted. </p> <p>\u0095 Dorothy Rowe is the author of Breaking the Bonds: Understanding Depression and Finding Freedom (HarperCollins, \u00a39.99).</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong> Mary Mason</strong> Popular singer and mother <br> My 13-year-old daughter, Jamie Lee, has inherited her looks from me. I didn't like my nose and had it improved with plastic surgery, which absolutely changed my life. She has inherited my nose and is very keen to have plastic surgery on her nose, too. She is already on the stage and looks are so important in the entertainment business. She goes to stage school and all the girls want plastic surgery for Christmas. If her skeleton is mature enough at 16 I won't stop her having her nose done. I could not live with my nose so why should I expect her to live with hers</p> <p>Verdict: Permit surgery</p> <p><strong> John Pickering</strong> Clinical director at the Transform Clinic </p> <p> Many teenagers do come to us but it's not appropriate if they haven't finished growing. Young people have rhinoplasty (plastic surgery of the nose) or have their ears pinned back after years of being bullied and it makes a huge difference to their self-esteem. But recently a young woman with 34C breasts wanted to become a 34E so she could earn money as a glamour model. We would not perform an operation like that on a teenager. It is important to involve a young person's parents and their GP, if surgery is being considered, and not to make a snap decision. </p> <p> Verdict: Consult carefully </p> <p> <strong> Dee Dawson</strong> Director of centre for children with eating disorders </p> <p> If one of my children came to me and said they wanted to have plastic surgery, I'd want to know what was contributing to that child's lack of self-confidence and self-esteem. I would see if there were any problems at home or at school because something must have happened to make a child want to do something so radical as that at such a young age. I would view it as unnecessary mutilation and tell her she's perfectly OK as she is, that we're all meant to be different and not look like one person. I think it's very important to boost a child's self-confidence in these situations. </p> <p> Verdict: Boost self-esteem </p> <p> <strong> Jane Frances</strong> Schools counsellor with Changing Faces </p> <p> Changing Faces provides support for people with disfigurement and I work with children in school who are bullied because of their looks. I run sessions that aim to encourage pupils to talk about things which make them feel different from each other and to look beyond physical appearance. If a child is worried about their appearance, it's important to acknowledge that worry but never miss a chance to highlight a positive inner quality like being fun to be with. Unfortunately, what counts as normal is narrowing because we have lost a lot of social intimacy. </p> <p> Verdict: Use counselling </p> <p> <strong>David Sharpe</strong> Ex-president, Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons </p> <p> I do get young girls requesting liposuction, but I would be very nervous about doing it for anyone under 21. Rhinoplasty is the commonest procedure for teenagers, but they have to be over 16. Breast surgery is rarely appropriate. More and more children are unhappy about their body image. I have sometimes performed a rhinoplasty on someone who turns out to be anorexic: the problem isn't their nose but their body image. It is often important to involve a clinical psychologist to have an assessment made before deciding on surgery. </p> <p> Verdict: See a psychologist </p> <p> <strong> Alison Mansfield</strong> Mother of three </p> <p> It would depend on what they wanted to change, how long it had been a problem and how necessary it was. For a serious, long-standing problem I'd agree. But I'd say no to things like liposuction and breast enlargement. If my daughter were over 16 and wanted either of those, I'd tell her that her body will change shape during her life and that having fat removed is temporary. I'd certainly take her wishes seriously and try to understand why she was considering it. But I'd try to deal with what might be the root of the problem, such as self-esteem, healthy eating or exercise. </p> <p> Verdict: Be sympathetic</p>",

I could not live with my nose so why should I expect her to live with hers Verdict: Permit surgery John Pickering Clinical director at the Transform Clinic Many teenagers do come to us but it's not appropriate if they haven't finished growing. Young people have rhinoplasty (plastic surgery of the nose) or have their ears pinned back after years of being bullied and it makes a huge difference to their self-esteem. But recently a young woman with 34C breasts wanted to become a 34E so she could earn money as a glamour model. We would not perform an operation like that on a teenager. It is important to involve a young person's parents and their GP, if surgery is being considered, and not to make a snap decision. Verdict: Consult carefully Dee Dawson Director of centre for children with eating disorders If one of my children came to me and said they wanted to have plastic surgery, I'd want to know what was contributing to that child's lack of self-confidence and self-esteem. I would see if there were any problems at home or at school because something must have happened to make a child want to do something so radical as that at such a young age. I would view it as unnecessary mutilation and tell her she's perfectly OK as she is, that we're all meant to be different and not look like one person. I think it's very important to boost a child's self-confidence in these situations. Verdict: Boost self-esteem Jane Frances Schools counsellor with Changing Faces Changing Faces provides support for people with disfigurement and I work with children in school who are bullied because of their looks. I run sessions that aim to encourage pupils to talk about things which make them feel different from each other and to look beyond physical appearance. If a child is worried about their appearance, it's important to acknowledge that worry but never miss a chance to highlight a positive inner quality like being fun to be with. Unfortunately, what counts as normal is narrowing because we have lost a lot of social intimacy. Verdict: Use counselling David Sharpe Ex-president, Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons I do get young girls requesting liposuction, but I would be very nervous about doing it for anyone under 21. Rhinoplasty is the commonest procedure for teenagers, but they have to be over 16. Breast surgery is rarely appropriate. More and more children are unhappy about their body image. I have sometimes performed a rhinoplasty on someone who turns out to be anorexic: the problem isn't their nose but their body image. It is often important to involve a clinical psychologist to have an assessment made before deciding on surgery. Verdict: See a psychologist Alison Mansfield Mother of three It would depend on what they wanted to change, how long it had been a problem and how necessary it was. For a serious, long-standing problem I'd agree. But I'd say no to things like liposuction and breast enlargement. If my daughter were over 16 and wanted either of those, I'd tell her that her body will change shape during her life and that having fat removed is temporary. I'd certainly take her wishes seriously and try to understand why she was considering it. But I'd try to deal with what might be the root of the problem, such as self-esteem, healthy eating or exercise. Verdict: Be sympathetic",

      "body": "<p>Parents do not live for ever. That is the plain truth, but somehow, no matter how old we grow ourselves, as their children we always hoodwink ourselves into believing the opposite. Mum and Dad: always there, part of the furniture. We never get round to telling them how much we appreciate all they have done because, well, there will be another opportunity. And we never bother to ask much about their past, because, after all, the subject is bound to crop up one day. </p> <p>Except that it never does. And then . . . bam! They die, and it always comes as a shock. (Though why it should be so is mysterious. After all, the deaths of our parents must be among the most predictable events of our lives.) Such a loss, too: more than we had ever imagined. Often there is no one to share that loss with; these days, you are expected to take, at most, a week off work and then return, ready to accept a few words of condolence and take up where you left off. Only it is not so easy, because suddenly you apprehend how much you have lost and where it has left you. </p> <p>\"Guilt, anger, despair, shock, sorrow, relief - it's all there, in this wildly swinging emotional turmoil. People seem to think you'll get over it within a few days, but it's a huge rite of passage as well as a loss.\" </p> <p>So says James Runcie, whose dad died five months ago. When most people's parents die, you don't necessarily hear about it, but Runcie's father was famous: he was the former Archbishop of Canterbury. One consequence is that friends make a beeline for Runcie to share their experiences of parental bereavement. \"I was at a Christmas party last night,\" he says, \"and so many people came up to me to talk about their grief at losing their parents. When it happens to you, you suddenly find yourself part of this big club you didn't even realise existed. </p> <p>\"Basically, the world is divided into people who have lost a parent and people who haven't. The latter are a bit scared of you: they're not sure what to say. But the former are falling over themselves to come and talk to you, to open up about their grief, to share it all with someone else who understands.\" </p> <p>Like everyone who has been bereaved, Runcie must have his regrets. But one thing he doesn't regret is having taken the opportunity to talk, really talk, to his father, about his life, about his marriage, about what he believed in and what he didn't, about what he wished he had done and what he wished he hadn't. In the weeks leading up to Lord Runcie's death from cancer, his son - a television film-maker - spoke to him on camera. The result is a portrait so intimate that at times you feel you are eavesdropping upon the most important conversation this father and son ever had. </p> <p>Runcie is grateful that his father's status provided the pretext to make his film. He was motivated by the desire to show that his dad was more than his Spitting Image puppet; that he was a funny, human, entertaining person (and in this intention, his film succeeds admirably). But he believes that such testimonies should not be reserved for the great and good, or for those who need to set a public record straight. </p> <p>\"Buy a camcorder, get out the camera, record them talking,\" he says. \"We spend so much time pointing the lens in the direction of the next generation, our own children, that we hardly ever think to turn it back towards grandad in the corner. But when they're gone, you really regret not having film and pictures of them. So many of my friends have said they wish they'd done something like this when their parents were still alive.\" </p> <p>Losing your parent's history with their death is a common experience. When they were alive, it was so easy to ask but you never did; and when they are not, there are gaps that are almost impossible to fill. As a public figure, Lord Runcie's career was well chronicled, so it was not so much a factual account that his son required as the personal flavour he had missed out on because his dad was busy ministering to a flock as well as supporting a family (often in that order, it seemed). Why, Runcie asks in the film, did his father marry his mother? What was it like growing up in Liverpool in the 1920s and 30s? And how on earth did the clergyman come to be president of the Cuddesdon Angling Society? </p> <p>A friend had advised Runcie that he should do everything he could to prepare for his father's death. He took the advice and believes that it has helped in the aftermath. But despite all that, nothing could prepare him for the terribleness of the actual event and the searing pain of the immediate loss. \"When it eventually came, my father's death was like nothing I had expected at all,\" he says. \"It was just too shocking to accept or accommodate.\" </p> <p> Runcie's mother-in-law also died this year. \"Her husband had died 10 years before,\" he says, \"so for my wife this was the death of her only surviving parent, which was a different kind of loss from the one I experienced. </p> <p>\"The death of your last parent strips away all sense of your childhood. It exposes you: it means there's no one left to mother you or father you any more. In some ways it's even more shocking than the first death.\" </p> <p>And yet, says Runcie, there is another complex emotion experienced on the death of a parent: relief. \"We never talk about it,\" he says. \"But there is relief. If the parent has been suffering, it's in the sense that they're not suffering any more. But there's another type of relief, too: it's to do with this sense that you can be yourself, that now you have to work out where your parent stops and you begin.\" </p> <p>The death of a parent also leaves a vacant role to be filled, Runcie observes. Every family has its peacemaker and its entertainer, its storyteller and its organiser. \"Some of what's gone has to be taken over, and the role can either be fragmented within the family or someone can seize the initiative and take on the part the parent played,\" says Runcie. \"In some ways, you are both becoming your parent and trying to escape him.\" </p> <p>In the film, Runcie pays his father this tribute: \"Although he had his faults, he taught me, by example, so much of what it is to live and, in the end, what it is to die.\" In the final shot, in an interview recorded just a week before the former archbishop died, the camera pans from father to son, as if to suggest the passing of a baton from one generation to the next. The last words belong to the younger Runcie: \"I don't think I can ask any more.\" </p> <p>\u0095 My Father will be shown on Channel 4 on Saturday at 8pm.</p>",

With this year's sales breaking all records even before the gift-buying season, the European Leisure Software Publishers Association predicts sales of \u00a3370m in the UK on games alone in the final quarter of 2000, and many families will invest more than \u00a3800 in a computer for their children. </p> <p>Some of these parents will be buying a second computer because they are fed up with sharing their own: according to research just published by Microsoft, one in four have had a PC crashed by the children overloading the hard drive with games. But many others will have been simply unable to withstand the onslaught of pester power. \"It's educational,\" a child will insist, coming over all PC at the prospect of owning a PC. \"My teacher says I'll get better marks if my homework is done on a computer.\" </p> <p>This might well be a bluff, of course. On the other hand, it could be true. At one primary school in Wandsworth, south London, a fourth-year class of eight- and nine-year-olds was told precisely this by a teacher who said the use of computers by pupils made it easier for her to read their projects. The class rep promptly booked an appointment with the head and put an end to that. </p> <p>From the Department for Education and Employment down, however, most of those involved in teaching children believe wholeheartedly in the educational value of computers. A key Labour pledge at the 1997 election was to connect every classroom to the internet; so far, 98% of secondary and 80% of primary schools have made the link. A further \u00a31bn has been pledged to UK online, a scheme to set up 6,000 centres providing free or cheap internet services to the public in the next two years. </p> <p>Richard Millwood, the deputy director of Ultralab, a research team at Anglia Polytechnic University in Cambridge that advised the Labour party on its election pledge, is clear on the benefits of computers to children. \"Computers empower,\" he says. \"They provide new ways to think about things which are mind-expanding.\" </p> <p>Even young children, he maintains, have little trouble manipulating programs that can seem daunting to adults - from word processors and spreadsheets to movie-making packages. He is also clear that popular computer game consoles such as the PlayStation can be educational, developing problem-solving abilities and physical skills. \"The truth is that games are all about learning,\" he says. \"The question is: can these skills be transferred? And I think the answer is yes.\" </p> <p>The Parents' Information Network (Pin), an independent organisation that offers advice and support on computers and education, is equally enthusiastic. \"Children are very confident about computers, and find them very motivating towards their own work,\" says Pin's communications director, Maggie Holgate. \"And a child that doesn't have some level of access to computers is unfortunately going to be disadvantaged - this is the way the world is moving.\" </p> <p>Both Pin and Ultralab are, however, alive to the dangers posed by unsupervised access to computers, whether as a result of parental ignorance, apathy or complacency. Both recommend that computers should be in the living room or kitchen, and games should be set up for two or more players, with the parents taking an active role. \"In most cases, best practice isn't happening,\" Holgate admits. \"Many parents use the computer as a child-minding device; others lack confidence and feel inhibited about taking part; and some think they've done their bit just by buying it. But the downside of computers is very serious and potentially dangerous.\" </p> <p>The dangers include access to violent and pornographic material on the internet or in games; physical problems such as repetitive strain injury and postural complaints; the isolating effects of using a computer alone; and the addictive nature of computers, which may result in compulsive behaviour and neglect of schoolwork, exercise and social interaction. </p> <p>Few children are capable of regulating their computer use, and this is where parents must be active and vigilant. \"It is madness to give a child a computer which they keep in their bedroom,\" says Millwood. \"There must be engagement and a social context to computer use. You also need a printer so the child is doing something with an outcome, rather than just taking part in a passive and ephemeral process.\" </p> <p>Pin provides information sheets, website information and a telephone service to parents seeking advice on computer safety, filtering internet content, educational software and games, as well as information on how to improve their own IT skills. </p> <p>\"Buy the best computer you can afford,\" advises Pin's Jackie Disney. \"You will at least be able to keep up with the advances for a couple of years, and the cheaper models are less forgiving of mistakes by novices.\" </p> <p>You may decide as parents that these prices are beyond you; that with the government investing so much in computers at school and the new online centres, there is no need for your children to have one at home as well; or you may simply refuse to buy into the technological boom. Nick Seaton, the chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, a traditionalist pressure group, is cautious about being seen as anti-computer and out of touch, but he believes that new technology is not appropriate to children of primary school age. </p> <p>\"While they're spending time fiddling around with computers, other things are having to fall by the wayside,\" he argues. \"I also worry that a lot of this emphasis on computers is really to prepare youngsters for work in telephone call centres - basic, low-pay jobs - but it is not preparing them to do anything more constructive and challenging.\" </p> <p>The National Association for Primary Education also has strong reservations about computer use before key stage two. Although educational software exists for children as young as nine months, some reason that, because the brain cells are still forming physical links up to six or seven years, it is unwise to introduce computers to this age group. The neuroscientist Susan Greenfield recently presented this argument, warning that the standardised information received from computers could lead to \"standardised brain connections\" and a stifling of individuality and creativity. \"Of course, people get information from the internet,\" said Greenfield in an address to the Royal Institution, \"but you can't necessarily get a framework into which to put the facts. That has to come from thinking, walking and living.\" </p> <p>This echoes the warnings from computer enthusiasts at Pin and Ultralab: if you do invest in a computer for your family, it must not become the centre of your child's life, and you must be prepared to find out how it works and keep its use under your control. Perhaps it is time to adapt the old RSPCA slogan: a computer is not just for Christmas. </p> <p><strong>Useful links:</strong> </p> <p> Pin: 020-7357 9078 or <a href=\"http://www.pin.org.uk\">www.pin.org.uk</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.dfee.gov.uk/parents/index.shtml\">DfEE parents' site</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.safety.ngfl.gov.uk\"> DfEE's Superhighway Safety Pack</a><br>Parental advice at: <a href=\"http://www.becta.org.uk/publications\"> www.becta.org.uk/publications</a></p>",

You also need a printer so the child is doing something with an outcome, rather than just taking part in a passive and ephemeral process.\" Pin provides information sheets, website information and a telephone service to parents seeking advice on computer safety, filtering internet content, educational software and games, as well as information on how to improve their own IT skills. \"Buy the best computer you can afford,\" advises Pin's Jackie Disney. \"You will at least be able to keep up with the advances for a couple of years, and the cheaper models are less forgiving of mistakes by novices.\" You may decide as parents that these prices are beyond you; that with the government investing so much in computers at school and the new online centres, there is no need for your children to have one at home as well; or you may simply refuse to buy into the technological boom. Nick Seaton, the chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, a traditionalist pressure group, is cautious about being seen as anti-computer and out of touch, but he believes that new technology is not appropriate to children of primary school age. \"While they're spending time fiddling around with computers, other things are having to fall by the wayside,\" he argues. \"I also worry that a lot of this emphasis on computers is really to prepare youngsters for work in telephone call centres - basic, low-pay jobs - but it is not preparing them to do anything more constructive and challenging.\" The National Association for Primary Education also has strong reservations about computer use before key stage two. Although educational software exists for children as young as nine months, some reason that, because the brain cells are still forming physical links up to six or seven years, it is unwise to introduce computers to this age group. The neuroscientist Susan Greenfield recently presented this argument, warning that the standardised information received from computers could lead to \"standardised brain connections\" and a stifling of individuality and creativity. \"Of course, people get information from the internet,\" said Greenfield in an address to the Royal Institution, \"but you can't necessarily get a framework into which to put the facts. That has to come from thinking, walking and living.\" This echoes the warnings from computer enthusiasts at Pin and Ultralab: if you do invest in a computer for your family, it must not become the centre of your child's life, and you must be prepared to find out how it works and keep its use under your control. Perhaps it is time to adapt the old RSPCA slogan: a computer is not just for Christmas.

I've been writing this column for seven months, and I know that IVF and preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), in which embryos are tested for an inherited condition and any unaffected ones are inserted back in the womb, are contentious issues. </p> <p>Last month's announcement by the government that it was reviewing IVF funding, enabling more couples to have infertility treatment on the NHS, provoked outrage. The claim was that cancer patients would be pushed out of hospital beds to make room for selfish late-middle-aged women determined to defy their biology and have a child. At the same time, parliament debated the chief medical officer's cloning report, and so-called designer babies were headlines again. So convinced was a friend by this misrepresentation that when I told her my forthcoming twins are a boy and a girl, she said: \"Oh, so that's what you chose!\" - as though PGD was rather like going to Sainsbury's. All I chose is embryos that wouldn't have a catastrophic chromosomal disorder and die. </p> <p>So I knew that hate mail would come soon. But, when it did, I was surprised by its source. It was not from those who are competing for NHS funds, nor from those who hold religious objections, nor from the anti-designer-baby lobby. It was from another barren woman whose fourth IVF attempt had just failed. It was a very angry letter and she was angry because I had become pregnant. \"I thought, at last, someone was going to tell it how it is for 90% of us. But no. You were pregnant. You had inexplicable bleeding, but there you were, still pregnant despite it. I was absolutely furious . . . Won't some journalist write the real story,\" she wrote. </p> <p>Of course, she is right. We only hear the stories with happy endings - although I could have had no idea when I started this column that I would be in the fortunate 10%. But why does she aim her anger at me? Why does she not attack those who make us pay through the nose for our procedure, jump through moral hoops to prove we will be perfect parents, and then condemn us as selfish. \"I am saddened that you feel I should be the target of your anger,\" I wrote back, \"and not a world that is ignorant of and often indifferent to the agonies of IVF.\" </p> <p>As if one had bred the other, a second upsetting letter arrived from another woman. She was pregnant after her sixth attempt at IVF. Her message, however, was very different from the first. \"We are filled with unalloyed joy at our good luck,\" she declared. I, on the other hand, had displayed all the wrong responses, admitting that I was as ambivalent about pregnancy as any other woman, barren or otherwise. Just because I went through a lengthy medical procedure to get there does not mean I haven't often asked myself whether I've made the right choice to have a child. But I should be celebrating my \"good fortune\". \"You are wallowing in self-pity,\" she wrote. \"Stop feeling sorry for yourself.\" </p> <p>I replied to this second correspondent, too: \"There is no appropriate response for any woman to feel when they become pregnant through any method . . . Your unalloyed joyfulness is wonderful, but most women feel nothing like you. Most are anxious, unsure . . .\" </p> <p>These are just two correspondents among more than 100 supportive messages, so I really should not take it so personally. And with the first woman, who is not pregnant, I have now reached an understanding. She responded: \"My point is: where is the writing about the agonies of IVF? Maybe no one wants to read it.\" Again, she is right. Most letters relate their authors' stories of unsuccessful attempts; I hope soon that there will be more people willing to listen. </p> <p>I know how this woman feels. I have never thought of myself as angry or bitter. But there was a time, before I was pregnant, when I was going through the heavy swing doors of a shop and turned to hold them open for whoever was behind. It was a pregnant woman. I let the door slam in her face. </p> <p>The second correspondent and I have reached no such understanding. Her last communication asks: \"If you were so ambivalent about pregnancy and fertility treatment, why on earth did you undergo it?\" Well, because - despite what is said by those who hold religious beliefs that I don't share, and despite the misinformation that designer babies are picked merely for their physical attributes, and despite what you say - I had no choice.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto: leahwild@cswebmail.com\">leahwild@cswebmail.com</a></p>",

No one questioned him as to whether they had a well-founded fear of persecution or whether the carpentry trade was just slack in Judaea. No one wrote in the Cairo Advertiser that the slaughter of the innocents had been greatly exaggerated or that it was a civil war in which the babies were as much to blame as the Romans. </p> <p>It seems that the Egyptians of 2,000 years ago had a more humane approach to refugees than does New Labour. What Jack Straw thinks of Herod's crackdown on potential young offenders is harder to assess. One might hope that, as a Christian of Jewish descent, Straw would be wary.

Joseph's tax affairs (his whole reason for schlepping his emergent family to Bethlehem) must have been thrown into disarray by the sudden acquisition of gold that would be very hard to account for. But Mary must have been a bit new age to favour a straw birth, so probably believed in aromatherapy and enjoyed the frankincense. Whether myrrh guards against nappy rash I don't know. The shepherds appear only in Luke and don't appear to have brought anything, but they were sore afraid by the angel of the Lord and probably a bit freaked out by the whole thing. </p> <p>Two millennia on, we know that children need to be stimulated, to play. I say, \"we\" but apparently there are some who doubt this. The national asylum support service, a shadowy Home Office agency charged with making refugees' lives as miserable as possible, defines toys as \"non-essential items\". It is commendable, therefore, that the TUC is collecting and distributing toys to refugee children this Christmas. It is regrettable that union leaders were persuaded not to humiliate the government over the voucher scheme at the Labour party conference. </p> <p>Many of us will be sending vouchers to nieces, nephews and godchildren at the moment, expressly because we want them to be able to buy a toy. It might be unimaginative in our time-poor culture merely to weigh up whether Smiths or Woolworths is the more festive place to spend a gift token, but at least we are hoping that the kids end up with something fun. Barbara Roche appears to consider toys to be frivolous trifles. Perhaps she distributes small boxes of fish fingers to the younger members of her family. </p> <p>Roche is currently engaged in a \"review\", not of the principle of forcing refugees to live on vouchers with a value substantially lower than the level of income support, but of the way the scheme operates. This is less than was hoped for when the union revolt was headed off, and perhaps means that, after the deadline for submissions on the 22nd, an announcement will be slipped out over Christmas to the effect that supermarkets will no longer be able to pocket the change. The supermarkets are being canvassed for their views and I'm sure are heartily in favour of pocketing the change, but will still be glad of the captive market the vouchers assure them. Perhaps the review is actually a look at extending the scheme to other benefit claimants. </p> <p>Meanwhile in this season of goodwill, the government is busily jailing as many refugees as it can. It has quietly ordered 500 new prison places to be set aside for them in the run-up to Christmas. There are now 75 places in HMP Belmarsh, with its 23-hour lock-up regime, and 60 in the notorious Wandsworth. </p> <p>And 38% of asylum decisions are now refusals for \"non-compliance\" - meaning that refugees failed to fill in the 20-page standard evidence form on time, complete in every detail and in English. This figure has increased fourfold since January, and means people can be banged-up pending deportation without their cases even being considered. </p> <p>No toys, then, but perhaps a visit to Daddy in jail will be a Christmas treat for the children of those who flee to Britain.</p>",

Perhaps the review is actually a look at extending the scheme to other benefit claimants. Meanwhile in this season of goodwill, the government is busily jailing as many refugees as it can. It has quietly ordered 500 new prison places to be set aside for them in the run-up to Christmas. There are now 75 places in HMP Belmarsh, with its 23-hour lock-up regime, and 60 in the notorious Wandsworth. And 38% of asylum decisions are now refusals for \"non-compliance\" - meaning that refugees failed to fill in the 20-page standard evidence form on time, complete in every detail and in English. This figure has increased fourfold since January, and means people can be banged-up pending deportation without their cases even being considered. No toys, then, but perhaps a visit to Daddy in jail will be a Christmas treat for the children of those who flee to Britain.",

      "bodyText": "1. On December 12 the US supreme court all but handed the US election to one George W Bush. 2. Dubya was born to George and Barbara on July 6, 1946, in New Haven Connecticut, under the sign of Cancer. He moved to Texas aged two, and grew up being called \"Junior\" and dreaming of baseball hero Willie Mays. 3. Like his father before him, he became a member of the Skull and Bones, Yale's oldest secret society - and soon developed close ties to the oil industry. 4. Unlike his father, he also developed a reputation for getting well-oiled, on one occasion while behind the wheel of a car. Here's a video of him years later, looking rather the worse for wear. 5. The fascination for baseball didn't wear off either: he liked it so much he bought the team, a success that put him on the presidential path. 6. Little-known fact: Dubya's other favourite sport is bass fishing. 7. Some say Bush is too stupid to be president. Others think he's just got a way with words. What do you think? 8. While he was governor of Texas, more prisoners were executed than in any other state - but the American people didn't want to make a song and dance about it. 9. The media have not been kind about the outlook for the presidency. Here's his inauguration speech and a diary of his first 100 days. 10. Punch him. You know you want to.",

Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist party claimed that the two leaders had refused to meet its representatives at parliament buildings, Stormont.

Republicans today repeated their demand that British military surveillance posts must be cleared from the south Armagh countryside, and that the proposals of Chris Patten's inquiry into policing reform in Northern Ireland has to be implemented in full. The government's timetable for implementing those changes may be announced by the end of the week, but with Sinn Fein preparing to go to the high court on Friday to challenge Mr Trimble's ban on the party's two ministers, Martin McGuinness and Bairbre de Brun, from attending north-south ministerial meetings, the parties at Stormont predicted little chance of agreement on a formula for the way ahead. Ahead of Mr Clinton's speech, Mr Trimble told the crowd at the Odyssey arena that real peace in Northern Ireland cannot be achieved until the IRA disarm. He said there could be no moral vacuum at the heart of the process and that \"justification lies in there being a transition from a violent past to a peaceful democratic future. That is why I stand firm on the need for decommissioning.\" Meanwhile, Mr Clinton was today given a great degree of credit for Northern Ireland's falling unemployment rate and economic recovery. The latest unemployment figures were released showing the number out of work had dropped 10,000 over the past year to 45,000 or 6%. Sir Reg Empey, the Stormont minister for enterprise, trade and investment, said the Northern Ireland economy had grown steadily over the five years since the president's first visit to the province in 1995. He said: \"While this growth cannot be wholly attributed to the US, it is a fact that the involvement of the largest industrial power in the world has had a far-reaching influence on the Northern Ireland economy.\" Related special report US election Related stories What next for Clinton? 13 December: Long goodbye of Clinton, an Irish hero 13 December: Serious message behind the smiles Useful links Ulster Unionists Democratic Unionist Party Sinn Fein Social Democratic and Labour Party Good Friday agreement Royal Ulster Constabulary Belfast Telegraph Cain (conflict archive on the internet)",

Democrats in America, those with both a large and small 'd', are boiling with rage at a verdict from the US supreme court which they believe has stolen the presidency from them - and undermined American democracy in the process.</p> <p>The implications of the supreme court's verdict are enormous. First, they have all but handed victory to George W Bush by blocking a full count of all Florida's votes. Those ballots will not now be tallied, but remain under lock and key in a Tallahasee courthouse.</p> <p>Second, they have guaranteed that Bush will never be seen as a legitimate president. If they had allowed a full count under a common standard, then both sides could have lived with the outcome - no matter who won. But the court has ensured that Democrats will always believe Bush's victory was tainted. \"He wasn't elected,\" one senior Clinton administration official told me this morning. \"The word \"elect\" should never be associated with George Bush.\"</p> <p>Third, the Supreme Court has unleashed what could be a legal, and ultimately racial, war in America. Central to the judges' ruling was their fear that any Florida recount lacking a common standard would violate the constitution's promise of \"equal protection\" for every US citizen. If different counting procedures operated in different areas, then some voters would count while others would not, which would be \"unequal\" and unfair.</p> <p>But that same logic could now be used by voters anywhere in America, complaining that different counting standards applied within their states - and indeed have always applied between different states.

      "bodyText": "The blood of anger is rising. Democrats in America, those with both a large and small 'd', are boiling with rage at a verdict from the US supreme court which they believe has stolen the presidency from them - and undermined American democracy in the process. The implications of the supreme court's verdict are enormous. First, they have all but handed victory to George W Bush by blocking a full count of all Florida's votes. Those ballots will not now be tallied, but remain under lock and key in a Tallahasee courthouse. Second, they have guaranteed that Bush will never be seen as a legitimate president. If they had allowed a full count under a common standard, then both sides could have lived with the outcome - no matter who won. But the court has ensured that Democrats will always believe Bush's victory was tainted. \"He wasn't elected,\" one senior Clinton administration official told me this morning. \"The word \"elect\" should never be associated with George Bush.\" Third, the Supreme Court has unleashed what could be a legal, and ultimately racial, war in America. Central to the judges' ruling was their fear that any Florida recount lacking a common standard would violate the constitution's promise of \"equal protection\" for every US citizen. If different counting procedures operated in different areas, then some voters would count while others would not, which would be \"unequal\" and unfair. But that same logic could now be used by voters anywhere in America, complaining that different counting standards applied within their states - and indeed have always applied between different states. Citizens in poor or mainly-black areas could complain that their votes are counted using aged, creaky machines while voters in richer districts use state-of-the-art technology - and that therefore their constitutional right to \"equal protection\" has been violated. The supreme court, using last night's ruling as a precedent, would have to agree. By declaring that a lack of uniformity in vote-counting amounts to unequal protection, the high court may have done nothing less than invalidate the entire US electoral system. The more immediate victim however, besides Al Gore and the system, is the supreme court itself. As the liberal lion of the bench, John Paul Stevens, put it in his strident, dissenting opinion: \"Although we may never know with complete certainty the identity of the winner of this year's presidential election, the identity of the loser is perfectly clear.

Americans will now regard the judges as politicians just like everyone else - with five Republican appointees who were prepared to stage what that Clinton official calls \"a raw seizure of power\" just to install their man in the White House.

The council will focus on Europe and north America where the potential for growth is greatest. Gold is still enormously popular in Asia, but the Asian market is considered to be saturated. The World Gold Council was today playing down the importance of the campaign, but sources said it could be worth up to $50m. Haruko Fukuda, chief executive of the council, said: \"We are doing a selection process at the moment, but we talk to ad agencies all the time. \"It is true to say that we are trying to make gold more a part of everyday life and we are putting a lot of effort into making it more relevant.\" She added that the World Gold Council is also talking to PR agencies about a campaign. In the past, the World Gold Council has concentrated on local marketing efforts and on co-funded advertising campaigns with jewellery manufacturers. Earlier this year it launched a press campaign in Europe featuring the famous ballerina Darcy Bussel. Another recent campaign ran in the US style press and used the line, \"Gold-fashioned Girls\". The ads were funded with jewellers including Tissot Watches. Formal agency pitches will take place next year and the organisation is aiming to launch the campaign in the run-up to Christmas 2001.",

      "bodyText": "Beijing has sentenced a Chinese citizen who is a US resident to three years in prison for \"spying\" on behalf of the banned Falun Gong sect. The move came as more tough measures were being taken against religious dissent elsewhere in China. Teng Chunyan, a sect member who works as an acupuncturist in New York, had entered China under a pseudonym and tipped off foreign reporters about protests by Falun Gong members. Ms Teng is said to have smuggled a digital camera into a centre outside Beijing where members of the sect were being detained. She was accused of collaborating with 50 practitioners from a rural district in Beijing who had allegedly been locked in a mental hospital to prevent them from demonstrating in Tiananmen Square. A spokesman for the US state department, Richard Boucher, last week called Ms Teng's case \"deeply disturbing\", but her sentence is regarded as relatively light. Mr Boucher urged China to uphold the internationally recognised right of citizens to take part in \"peaceful spiritual pursuits.\" The Falun Gong is an embarrassment to Washington partly because the sect's leader, Li Hongzhi, has lived in the US for some years. This has given ammunition to Chinese hardliners who accuse the US of fomenting subversion against the Chinese Communist Party. President Clinton said last December that the detention in China of Falun Gong members was a \"troubling example\" of Beijing's response to those who \"test the limits of freedom.\" China has accused Mr Li of trying to organise a political conspiracy against the state.

According to the Coming Attractions website, the star of The Virgin Suicides and Drop Dead Gorgeous will play the feisty Mary Jane Watson, love interest to our web-spinning superhero. The role had previously been linked to Mena Suvari, from American Beauty, and Alicia Witt, who appeared in TV's Cybill. Dunst joins Tobey Maguire (who plays Spiderman) and Willem Dafoe (the Green Goblin) in Sam Raimi's film. \u0095 David Arquette is in final negotiations to take the lead role in Warner Bros' comedy-thriller Arach Attack, to be directed by Ellory Elkayem. Best known as the gawky cop of the Scream series (and off-screen husband of Friends star Courtney Cox), Arquette will play an everyman hero battling to stave off an invasion of giant mutant spiders.",

The corporation closed two of the studios at its midlands headquarters this summer with the loss of 90 jobs. The corporation will announce today that production and technical staff at Pebble Mill will move to the Mailbox, its central Birmingham office. The BBC denied that there would be redundancies, saying the Mailbox had room for all 600 of the staff currently working at Pebble Mill. But the corporation's regional base has seen a drop in production over the past few years. Although programmes such as Top Gear, the Archers and a number of daytime and lifestyle TV and radio programmes are still made in Birmingham, the studio has declined since its 1970s heyday when it produced programmes such as Pebble Mill at One. Andy Griffee, BBC controller of nations and regions, said that the move would make the BBC \"more visible and accessible to our audience\". Last month BBC director general Greg Dyke announced that the corporation was pumping nearly \u00a350m into an incentive to boost programme production from the regions, including new plans for a Scottish TV soap.",

The same goes for the leaders of most western countries and Russia and China.</p> <p>Mr Bush has shown little interest in getting to know the world beyond Texas, where he is governor, having travelled abroad only three times in his adult life, excluding visits to neighbouring Mexico. He has not even visited Canada.</p> <p>This means that Mr Bush, if he takes the White House, will inevitably rely on more seasoned advisers in formulating America's future defence and foreign policy. This group includes Dick Cheney, his running mate, who is poised to become vice-president next month.</p> <p>The hawkish Mr Cheney served as defence secretary at the Pentagon during the presidency of Mr Bush's father, George Bush Sr, from 1989-93. He helped mastermind the Gulf war against Iraq and is seen by some as the father of \"Star Wars II\", the national missile defence system that Mr Bush advocates and which is fiercely opposed by China, Russia and some Nato allies.</p> <p>Another Gulf war \"veteran\", General Colin Powell, who at that time was chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, is widely tipped to become Mr Bush's secretary of state, in charge of America's global diplomacy.</p> <p>The cautious Gen Powell is opposed, in broad terms, to involving the US military in overseas conflicts. He advised President Bush Snr to call a ceasefire in 1991, rather than order US forces in southern Iraq to advance on Baghdad and overthrow Saddam Hussein. Some analysts see this as a crucial mistake that has led to a decade of continuing problems.</p> <p>Gen Powell, like other advisers around Mr Bush, is against placing US forces under UN command and is generally sceptical about the efficacy of UN peacekeeping and nation-building operations.</p> <p>Condoleeza Rice, a Stanford university academic who also served under Mr Bush's father and who may become national security adviser, shares this tendency towards unilateralism and non-engagement.</p> <p>Like the Republicans in Congress, who retained control of both the House of Representatives and the Senate and thus all the key decision-making committees in last month's polls, Ms Rice says the US should get involved abroad only if the country's vital national interests are at stake.</p> <p>She recently suggested, for example, that a Bush presidency would seek to withdraw US forces from Kosovo and Bosnia, even though the situation in the Balkans remains far from stable.</p> <p>On the other hand, America's new president will inherit a set of ongoing foreign policy problems which America is deeply committed to resolving.</p> <p>These include the crisis in the Middle East, where the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians, Syria and Lebanon has broken down, and where the US is the lead mediator.</p> <p>The UN sanctions regime against Iraq has all but collapsed - another instant headache for a Bush administration. Mr Bush's team espouses a hard line and does not rule out further military action - but it has so far offered no new solutions to the \"Saddam problem\".</p> <p>Bush policies on national missile defence, on the environment (he opposes the Kyoto accord on measures to combat climate change), on global pandemics such as Aids, on development aid, on free and fair trade arrangements with the developing world, on treaties to curb weapons nuclear proliferation, and on relations with \"rogue states\" such as Iran, Libya and Cuba, all potentially place him at odds with British government positions, and on the policies espoused by many other western democracies.</p> <p>A Bush presidency will mean that a lot of hard thinking and deft footwork in Downing Street and beyond will be required before he takes the oath of office on January 20.</p> <p><b>\u0095 An earlier version of this article was published on November 8 2000</b></p> <p><b>Key rulings</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.supremecourtus.gov/florida.html\" target=\"_new\">US supreme court rulings </a><br> <a href=\"http://www.flcourts.org/pubinfo/election/index.html\" target=\"_new\">Florida supreme court rulings</a></p> <p><b>Related stories</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,410769,00.html\">Florida moves to hand Bush victory</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Columnists/Column/0,5673,410788,00.html\">Jonathan Freedland: a nation divided</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,400160,00.html\">Timeline - when will America decide?</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,398516,00.html\">Election glossary</a> <br><a href=\" http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/graphic/0,5543,398700,00.html\">Graphic: Know your chad</a><br></p> <p><b>Photo gallery</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/gall/0,8542,409877,00.html\">After the vote, before the ruling</a></p> <p><b>Interactive</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/flash/0,5543,394350,00.html\">Results declared, state by state</a></p> <p><b>Audio</b> <br> <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/1204borger.ra\">'People are beginning to ask questions'</a><br> <b>3 December 2000:</b> Julian Borger in Tallahassee on the black voters denied their rights.

Mr Bush has shown little interest in getting to know the world beyond Texas, where he is governor, having travelled abroad only three times in his adult life, excluding visits to neighbouring Mexico. He has not even visited Canada. This means that Mr Bush, if he takes the White House, will inevitably rely on more seasoned advisers in formulating America's future defence and foreign policy. This group includes Dick Cheney, his running mate, who is poised to become vice-president next month. The hawkish Mr Cheney served as defence secretary at the Pentagon during the presidency of Mr Bush's father, George Bush Sr, from 1989-93. He helped mastermind the Gulf war against Iraq and is seen by some as the father of \"Star Wars II\", the national missile defence system that Mr Bush advocates and which is fiercely opposed by China, Russia and some Nato allies. Another Gulf war \"veteran\", General Colin Powell, who at that time was chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, is widely tipped to become Mr Bush's secretary of state, in charge of America's global diplomacy. The cautious Gen Powell is opposed, in broad terms, to involving the US military in overseas conflicts. He advised President Bush Snr to call a ceasefire in 1991, rather than order US forces in southern Iraq to advance on Baghdad and overthrow Saddam Hussein. Some analysts see this as a crucial mistake that has led to a decade of continuing problems. Gen Powell, like other advisers around Mr Bush, is against placing US forces under UN command and is generally sceptical about the efficacy of UN peacekeeping and nation-building operations. Condoleeza Rice, a Stanford university academic who also served under Mr Bush's father and who may become national security adviser, shares this tendency towards unilateralism and non-engagement. Like the Republicans in Congress, who retained control of both the House of Representatives and the Senate and thus all the key decision-making committees in last month's polls, Ms Rice says the US should get involved abroad only if the country's vital national interests are at stake. She recently suggested, for example, that a Bush presidency would seek to withdraw US forces from Kosovo and Bosnia, even though the situation in the Balkans remains far from stable. On the other hand, America's new president will inherit a set of ongoing foreign policy problems which America is deeply committed to resolving. These include the crisis in the Middle East, where the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians, Syria and Lebanon has broken down, and where the US is the lead mediator. The UN sanctions regime against Iraq has all but collapsed - another instant headache for a Bush administration. Mr Bush's team espouses a hard line and does not rule out further military action - but it has so far offered no new solutions to the \"Saddam problem\". Bush policies on national missile defence, on the environment (he opposes the Kyoto accord on measures to combat climate change), on global pandemics such as Aids, on development aid, on free and fair trade arrangements with the developing world, on treaties to curb weapons nuclear proliferation, and on relations with \"rogue states\" such as Iran, Libya and Cuba, all potentially place him at odds with British government positions, and on the policies espoused by many other western democracies. A Bush presidency will mean that a lot of hard thinking and deft footwork in Downing Street and beyond will be required before he takes the oath of office on January 20. \u0095 An earlier version of this article was published on November 8 2000 Key rulings US supreme court rulings Florida supreme court rulings Related stories Florida moves to hand Bush victory Jonathan Freedland: a nation divided Timeline - when will America decide?

      "bodyText": "Rupert Murdoch has appointed his son James to the board of News Corporation, leaving two of his children with a clear line to the throne. James joins elder brother Lachlan, who is deputy chief operating officer of the media company, after serving his apprenticeship as chief executive of Asian satellite station Star TV. The 27-year-old is unlikely to climb above Lachlan in the pecking order, as his 29-year-old brother holds the third most senior position in Mr Murdoch's global empire. Mr Murdoch senior said: \"James's outstanding leadership at Star TV and in our new media operations has given him a breadth of knowledge vital to News Corporation as we move our businesses into the interactive future.\" NewsCorp's chief is shaking up the management at his global media empire to ensure a smooth succession after he retires. Mr Murdoch has made clear that chief operating officer Peter Chernin is the first choice to succeed him, although he may be joined by one of his sons in five or eight years' time. Daughter Elisabeth Murdoch, 31, dropped out of the running earlier this year when she resigned as managing director of Sky Networks, which runs BSkyB. Ms Murdoch, who last month gave birth to a third daughter, Charlotte, has since taken up a boardroom post with magazine publisher Future Network. New York-based News Corporation is the world's fifth-largest media company, with the Fox Entertainment Group and News International newspapers in its portfolio. About 70% of its revenue comes from the US. Despite assurances to the contrary, News Corporation continues to stumble over the flotation of its Sky Global Networks subsidiary, which contains all of Mr Murdoch's satellite TV interests.

      "body": "<p>There are not many, even among his opponents, who would compare Zimbabwe's president to Africa's most notorious rulers.</p> <p>He is clearly no Idi Amin, Mobutu Sese Seko or Sani Abacha. Zimbabwe's press is still among the most vigorous and outspoken in Africa, as demonstrated by the newspapers' constant denunciations of Mr Mugabe.</p> <p>And yet more and more Zimbabweans view their president as anything but a democrat.</p> <p>Mr Mugabe's supporters ask how a man elected with an overwhelming majority of the ballot in an indisputably free election just three years ago can be called a dictator.</p> <p>He may be unpopular, they say, but that is wholly different from being an illegitimate leader. And Mr Mugabe's opinion poll ratings, at somewhere around 25% support, may be low but they are no worse than Margaret Thatcher at her most disliked.</p> <p>Mr Mugabe's critics point out that Mrs Thatcher, whatever her authoritarian tendencies, did not repeatedly defy the courts, give blanket amnesty to people who murdered her political opponents, order the police not to enforce the law and use a private army of thugs against an array of targets.</p> <p>Such critical views of Robert Mugabe are relatively recent even if his abuses of power are not. In the early Eighties, the Zimbabwean army murdered tens of thousands of civilians in Matabeleland in a bid to suppress dissent. But over the years that crime came to be seen as the exception to Mr Mugabe's otherwise popular rule.</p> <p>Now he has returned to the tactics of the past. His use of the self-styled independence 'war veterans' to seize white-owned farms and to harass dissidents inside the ruling party horrifies but does not surprise many Zimbabweans.</p> <p>But it is Mr Mugabe's repeated defiance of the courts that has raised greatest concern because it opens the way to almost any abuse, including an attempt to cling to power beyond the 2002 presidential election that he is almost certain to lose.</p> <p>When the high court ordered the police to remove 'war veterans' who illegally occupied white-owned farms, the president told his police chief to ignore the court.</p> <p>Then Mr Mugabe granted amnesty to ruling party supporters who murdered 30 people during the run up to June's parliamentary election, and to the killers of a white farmer. The message was clear. Those who murder for the president will not be punished.</p> <p>At the weekend, Mr Mugabe issued a decree ending any legal challenges to the results of the parliamentary ballot which, in some constituencies, was marred by violence, intimidation and rigging.</p> <p>Mr Mugabe's actions have led to a widespread view at home and abroad that the Zimbabwean government no longer considers itself bound by the rule of law - that the president is, in effect, a dictator.</p> <p>One of the ruling party's powerful politburo members and former cabinet minister, Nathan Shamuyarira, is dismissive of such charges.</p> <p>\"This government has been guided by the rule of law for the past 20 years. We have had the high court rule against us before and we have obeyed. But we don't think the land is a legal matter, we think it is a political matter and it should be dealt with between the farmers and the government. We have refused to send the police for that purpose because we believe they should be resolved in another way. There is a fundamental difference between us and the courts on this,\" he said.</p> <p>And on the question of the weekend decree taking election disputes out of the courts, Mr Shamuyarira paints legal challenges to vote rigging as part of an international conspiracy against Mr Mugabe.</p> <p>\"The opposition is continuing to do this to harass us and tie us up in expensive legal processes so they can bankrupt us. They have a lot of money coming in from the British and American governments so they can afford to pay the lawyers.

      "bodyText": "There are not many, even among his opponents, who would compare Zimbabwe's president to Africa's most notorious rulers. He is clearly no Idi Amin, Mobutu Sese Seko or Sani Abacha. Zimbabwe's press is still among the most vigorous and outspoken in Africa, as demonstrated by the newspapers' constant denunciations of Mr Mugabe. And yet more and more Zimbabweans view their president as anything but a democrat. Mr Mugabe's supporters ask how a man elected with an overwhelming majority of the ballot in an indisputably free election just three years ago can be called a dictator. He may be unpopular, they say, but that is wholly different from being an illegitimate leader. And Mr Mugabe's opinion poll ratings, at somewhere around 25% support, may be low but they are no worse than Margaret Thatcher at her most disliked. Mr Mugabe's critics point out that Mrs Thatcher, whatever her authoritarian tendencies, did not repeatedly defy the courts, give blanket amnesty to people who murdered her political opponents, order the police not to enforce the law and use a private army of thugs against an array of targets. Such critical views of Robert Mugabe are relatively recent even if his abuses of power are not. In the early Eighties, the Zimbabwean army murdered tens of thousands of civilians in Matabeleland in a bid to suppress dissent. But over the years that crime came to be seen as the exception to Mr Mugabe's otherwise popular rule. Now he has returned to the tactics of the past. His use of the self-styled independence 'war veterans' to seize white-owned farms and to harass dissidents inside the ruling party horrifies but does not surprise many Zimbabweans. But it is Mr Mugabe's repeated defiance of the courts that has raised greatest concern because it opens the way to almost any abuse, including an attempt to cling to power beyond the 2002 presidential election that he is almost certain to lose. When the high court ordered the police to remove 'war veterans' who illegally occupied white-owned farms, the president told his police chief to ignore the court. Then Mr Mugabe granted amnesty to ruling party supporters who murdered 30 people during the run up to June's parliamentary election, and to the killers of a white farmer. The message was clear. Those who murder for the president will not be punished. At the weekend, Mr Mugabe issued a decree ending any legal challenges to the results of the parliamentary ballot which, in some constituencies, was marred by violence, intimidation and rigging. Mr Mugabe's actions have led to a widespread view at home and abroad that the Zimbabwean government no longer considers itself bound by the rule of law - that the president is, in effect, a dictator. One of the ruling party's powerful politburo members and former cabinet minister, Nathan Shamuyarira, is dismissive of such charges. \"This government has been guided by the rule of law for the past 20 years. We have had the high court rule against us before and we have obeyed. But we don't think the land is a legal matter, we think it is a political matter and it should be dealt with between the farmers and the government. We have refused to send the police for that purpose because we believe they should be resolved in another way. There is a fundamental difference between us and the courts on this,\" he said. And on the question of the weekend decree taking election disputes out of the courts, Mr Shamuyarira paints legal challenges to vote rigging as part of an international conspiracy against Mr Mugabe. \"The opposition is continuing to do this to harass us and tie us up in expensive legal processes so they can bankrupt us. They have a lot of money coming in from the British and American governments so they can afford to pay the lawyers. We can't afford to pay the lawyers,\" he said. But the ruling party has not limited its scorn of the judiciary to defying court rulings. Senior officials have called for the expulsion from the country of white judges, who still dominate the higher reaches of the judiciary, on the grounds they are really British and have allegedly been serving Britain's interests. Former allies of Mr Mugabe - such as Moses Mvenge, a founder member of the ruling party and its chief whip in parliament until the election - have no doubt what the man they once supported has become. \"I have never seen a country where one arm of government, the executive, goes all out to discredit another arm, the judiciary. It really is becoming a dictatorship because one man thinks he can make every decision and ignore every other arm of government,\" he said.

      "bodyText": "It was escorted into Rome by a convoy of police vehicles, hoisted into position under cover of darkness and placed under 24-hour armed guard. It is 115-ft tall, points at the sky and has an explosive impact, but this is no missile. It is a Christmas tree. A handsome Carinthian fir, it is a green giant towering over the marble columns of St Peter's square. Every year a different region gives a tree but never before has it trailed a fuse. It leads to J\u00f6rg Haider, the far-Right Austrian politician, for he is the donor and as such is due to meet Pope John Paul II on Saturday. Accompanied by a 65-strong choir and a 52-piece band, Mr Haider, the governor of Carinthia, will have a private audience and then join public celebrations to unveil the tree. Whatever greetings he has to offer are likely to be drowned out by a swelling cacophony of protest. Italian government politicians have joined Jewish and left-wing groups in demanding a cancellation. Street battles cannot be ruled out since 400 Italian ultra-rightists are planning a counter-demonstration in support of Mr Haider. The Vatican needs this like a hole in the head. The climax of its jubilee, or holy year, is approaching. Of all the jubilee's successes, the improved relationship with Israel was perhaps the sweetest. The Pope's historic apology for the Catholic church's persecution of Jews was followed in March by an emotional pilgrimage to the holy land which melted suspicion. That breakthrough risks being undermined, though not destroyed, by Saturday's visit. Mr Haider, a dominant force in Austria's Freedom party, is a hate figure for many because of remarks and policies which suggested a hankering for the Nazi period. His party's entry into a coalition government last February triggered sanctions against Austria by European Union countries. The sanctions were dropped in September. Calling the visit a disappointment, Israel's foreign ministry said: \"Haider is a politician who is ostracized by the enlightened world. Granting honour to a man of this kind is liable to send a wrong and inappropriate message, unintentionally.\" That last word captures the Vatican's dilemma, for it chose Carinthia three years ago, before Mr Haider became governor. It could withdraw the invitation but that would break a tradition of not taking sides, or at least appearing not to, in political disputes. Cardinal Agnelo Sodano, Vatican secretary of state, said: \"The Holy See is open to everyone. During the war the Holy See had no relations with countries like the US, Britain or Japan, yet still (their) representatives regularly came and were received.\" That cuts little ice with Mr Haider's opponents who have revived accusations that the Vatican has always been more than partial to the right. Oliviero Diliberto - a cabinet minister as well as secretary of the Party of Italian Communists - anti-Nazi resistance fighters and the president of Rome's Jewish community have all signed a protest letter. Leaflets depicting the tree as a gallows have been thrown at the Pope's car. A torchlit procession will snake through Rome tomorrow under banners saying \"Haider, Rome doesn't forget\". There is talk of a light aircraft trailing other slogans buzzing the Vatican on Saturday. Those still hoping for a cancellation should not hold their breaths. The one true church has survived for 2,000 years paying little heed to public relations and damage limitation.

Do you believe that Globalisation benefits 'first world' countries or do you believe that it makes them poorer by denying their citizens many rights? <p><b>ClareShort</b><br>Globalisation is defined in the White Paper. It has been going on since the end of the Second World War. It has accelerated recently with the end of the Cold War creating one global economy and information technology speeding the transfer of knowledge and information across the world. People talk as though it is uncontrollable. This is false.

Developing countries will not agree to strengthened controls unless we guarantee that we will support development and poverty reduction in their countries.

For the less developed countries, globalisation offers access to foreign capital, global export markets, and advanced technology while breaking the monopoly of inefficient and protected domestic producers. Faster growth, in turn, promotes poverty reduction, democratisation, and higher labour and environmental standards. While globalisation may confront government officials with more difficult choices, the result for their citizens is greater individual freedom. In this sense, globalisation acts as a check on governmental power that makes it more difficult for governments to abuse the freedom and property of their citizens. </p> <p><b>ClareShort</b><br>I agree with you. But countries must shape the way globalisation effects them. Governments must provide education and health care for all their people - not just the elites in the city. And deal with corruption and put in place proper regulation of privatised utilities. With these and other reforms outlined in the White Paper, developing countries can move forward rapidly and bring real benefits to the poor. </p> <p><b>cdesouza</b><br>The education of the third world population is obviously an important \"long-term\" route to successful globalisation. In the meantime, how do you focus an economy on \"globalisation\" when the major part of the population simply do not understand this western concept? </p> <p><b>ClareShort</b><br>Education is key to poor countries getting access to IT and modern knowledge and technology. It is the commanding height of a modern economy. World Bank research shows clearly that the most powerful intervention that can be made in any country to promote development is getting a generation of children through primary education including the girls. As such children grow up, they transform their countries - girls marry later, have less children, their children are much more likely to live and be educated and girls that have been to school are better at getting health care for their families and increasing their family income. </p> <p>People all over the world understand that the world economy is changing, whether they call it globalisation or not. The strange contradiction is that demonstrators from the rich countries demand that multinational companies should not invest in developing countries and suggest that poor countries should not be open to trade. People in developing countries want more investment and understand this is the only way they will get access to modern technology and they want more trading opportunities so they can afford to import the things they need.</p>",

With these and other reforms outlined in the White Paper, developing countries can move forward rapidly and bring real benefits to the poor. cdesouza The education of the third world population is obviously an important \"long-term\" route to successful globalisation. In the meantime, how do you focus an economy on \"globalisation\" when the major part of the population simply do not understand this western concept? ClareShort Education is key to poor countries getting access to IT and modern knowledge and technology. It is the commanding height of a modern economy. World Bank research shows clearly that the most powerful intervention that can be made in any country to promote development is getting a generation of children through primary education including the girls. As such children grow up, they transform their countries - girls marry later, have less children, their children are much more likely to live and be educated and girls that have been to school are better at getting health care for their families and increasing their family income. People all over the world understand that the world economy is changing, whether they call it globalisation or not. The strange contradiction is that demonstrators from the rich countries demand that multinational companies should not invest in developing countries and suggest that poor countries should not be open to trade. People in developing countries want more investment and understand this is the only way they will get access to modern technology and they want more trading opportunities so they can afford to import the things they need.",

According to the Death Penalty Information Centre in Washington, the last time a state came anywhere close in its use of capital punishment was in 1862, when the US army executed 39 native Americans after an uprising in Minnesota.

      "bodyText": "Prime minister Tony Blair faced waves of voter indignation over the failing state of key public services - notably the NHS, crime, schools and transport - during his live TV grilling last night. Quizzed by a studio audience and telephone callers on the subject of extra pay for nurses, police and teachers, he said: \"It may not be enough or as much as people want, but it is a big start.\" The NHS is the biggest single issue concerning the public, judging from the number of callers and audience members wanting to test the prime minister on health issues. He confessed repeatedly that shortages of doctors and nurses, not cash, are the NHS's biggest problem. At one point presenter Jonathan Dimbleby had to steer callers and audience members off the subject of health and onto other issues such as the euro and education during the hour-long ITV show. Programme producer Alexander Gardiner told SocietyGuardian.co.uk: \"We had more calls on health than anything else, although there was also lots of interest in crime and social disintegration.\" Mr Gardiner said the key health topics raised by callers were \"bad personal experiences\" of NHS care, cancelled operations and waiting times. On the programme Mr Blair confessed his inability to improve the NHS quickly enough to ease the suffering of a woman whose 87-year-old mother has been told she must wait 68 weeks to see an orthopaedic surgeon. In an emotional exchange he told the distressed woman: \"I accept it is my responsibility to turn this situation around. I am trying to do it, I am trying my very level best to do it.\" Challenged to say why he and chancellor Gordon Brown had not spent more on public services like the NHS earlier in Labour's three year term, Mr Blair insisted they had been determined to ease crippling debt repayments to avoid Tory boom and bust in the economy. In a rare breach of the night's good tempered but highly assertive cross-examination by an audience at Yorkshire TV's Leeds studio - and telephone callers around the country - Mr Blair, stung by one hurled taunt on tight public spending limits, said: \"I don't intend to become a leftwing Margaret Thatcher.

The lights cast shadows from below, so he looked like your uncle pretending to be a ghost on Christmas Eve. It was like the opening of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire, and the prime minister had won the fastest finger round. In such ways does art imitate tripe. </p> <p>\"Well,\" he said at one point, \"it's the only time I get the chance to talk to people direct and not through newspapers,\" though on occasion the experience seemed to have brought him close to panic. You can always tell, because his eyes glaze over, like Bambi hearing the bad news about his mother. </p> <p>It's so much easier tackling William Hague. You felt he wanted Jonathan Dimbleby (surely the winner of the Leeds heat in the George W Bush lookalike contest) to tell him he still had one lifeline: shoot the audience. </p> <p>The programme was on ITV, and the overall effect was curiously disjointed. The questioners depicted a country in which the infrastructure had collapsed, where health care is rationed, and our teachers and police are quitting in thousands, leaving packs of uneducated, feral youngsters to terrorise the land. </p> <p>Yet the frequent ads which interrupted told the opposite story: the workers of Britain are buying computers, luxury Belgian chocolates, gourmet frozen food, scented unguents, and brand new BMW cars. </p> <p>Which picture of Britain is right?

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair walked down an illuminated catwalk. \"Tonight, live from Leeds, Ask The Prime Minister!\" a voice declaimed, and tingly music played. The lights cast shadows from below, so he looked like your uncle pretending to be a ghost on Christmas Eve. It was like the opening of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire, and the prime minister had won the fastest finger round. In such ways does art imitate tripe. \"Well,\" he said at one point, \"it's the only time I get the chance to talk to people direct and not through newspapers,\" though on occasion the experience seemed to have brought him close to panic. You can always tell, because his eyes glaze over, like Bambi hearing the bad news about his mother. It's so much easier tackling William Hague. You felt he wanted Jonathan Dimbleby (surely the winner of the Leeds heat in the George W Bush lookalike contest) to tell him he still had one lifeline: shoot the audience. The programme was on ITV, and the overall effect was curiously disjointed. The questioners depicted a country in which the infrastructure had collapsed, where health care is rationed, and our teachers and police are quitting in thousands, leaving packs of uneducated, feral youngsters to terrorise the land. Yet the frequent ads which interrupted told the opposite story: the workers of Britain are buying computers, luxury Belgian chocolates, gourmet frozen food, scented unguents, and brand new BMW cars. Which picture of Britain is right? Why, both are, of course. This is a nation where most people have stacks of money to buy things, yet nobody seems to be able to provide services. The audience began with train services. \"Ah want to be open with you,\" Mr Blair vouchsafed, \"it's absolute hell travelling on the railways at the present time\" - as if we didn't know.

      "byline": "Sarah Boseley, health editor",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Research fraud among doctors who want the kudos and money that go with publication in a leading medical journal is a problem that is \"surfacing like a decomposing corpse\" and yet the guardians of medical integrity are not taking the necessary steps to stamp it out, according to editors. </p> <p>Yesterday the editors of three of the most prestigious medical publications in the UK, Richard Horton of the Lancet, Richard Smith of the British Medical Journal, and Michael Farthing of Gut, denounced the General Medical Council and the Royal Colleges for failing to set up a national body to root out the fraudsters and deter others from faking research results. </p> <p>A year ago, they say in a letter to be published in their journals this week, the GMC and the colleges promised to act, but they had not. </p> <p>Dr Horton said that the medical institutions had been promising to take fraud seriously ever since the journal editors set up the Committee on Publication Ethics as a forum in which to discuss research misconduct. </p> <p>\"The GMC and the Royal Colleges have not shown the resolve they said they would show,\" he said at the launch of the COPE's third annual report yesterday. </p> <p>Last week the GMC found a consultant surgeon, Anjan Banerjee, guilty of serious professional misconduct for publishing an article in Gut that contained information that had been deliberately falsified. </p> <p>It took 10 years to bring him to book. While a junior doctor at King's College Hospital Mr Banerjee carried out a study investigating drug-induced damage to the small intestine. Not only was it published in Gut but it also went out as an abstract at a scientific meeting. Mr Banerjee based his results on the urine samples of \"12 healthy patients\". It was in fact his own urine. </p> <p>\"Dr Banerjee was suspended and not struck off, in spite of the finding of fact about fraud,\" said Dr Horton. </p> <p>He attacked the Academy of Medical Sciences, which acts as an umbrella body for all the royal colleges. It ought to be taking the lead in fighting misconduct, he said. \"They have been especially negligent with respect to promoting research integrity. They have issued two sets of guidelines, neither of which deal with research misconduct when they should have done.\" </p> <p>The GMC is deep in a process of reform, revising its constitution and reviewing the way it disciplines doctors. Only last month, Dr Horton said, the academy gave its advice. \"It was the best opportunity any independent body has had in recent years to strengthen the GMC's resolve in respect of misconduct.\" </p> <p>But instead, they said they had grave misgivings about making the GMC more accountable to the public. \"They are more concerned about protecting the profession,\" he said. </p> <p>The COPE's annual report is only a snapshot of the sort of research misconduct that is taking place, its members believe. The cases it discusses are only those which are raised at meetings by a journal editor who has nagging doubts about a paper that has been submitted for publication. Although papers are always sent for peer review to other scientists in the field, fraud is hidden and malpractice - such as a failure to ask the ethics committee for approval or the patients for consent - will not be picked up. </p> <p>The COPE has dealt with 110 cases by now, 30 of which came to light this year. There must be many more. \"Many, many editors in Britain don't bring cases to COPE,\" said Dr Smith. \"We have no idea still what fraction of the whole this represents,\" said Professor Farthing.\" Not all of them involve fraud - a common complaint is that research studies are submitted to more than one journal. In the case of a successful drug trial, this could make it appear as if there is more evidence for its safety and efficacy than really exists. </p> <p>Not all doctors agree there is a problem and if there is, then some argue about the solution. Richard Peto, the professor of epidemiology at Oxford University, famous for his work on the link between smoking and cancer, opposes the establishment of any new body that may impede scientists. He argues that scientists are already subject to \"harassment and hassle\" from ethics committees and other bureaucracies. </p> <p>Other cases include the British Medical Journal being sent a paper for publication from a surgeon who claimed to have a new treatment for migraine. His big idea was to put stitches in an artery that runs down the outside of the head. He claimed to have carried out the operation on 1,200 patients. </p> <p>\"There is no clear definition of how the diagnosis (of migraine) was made,\" says the COPE report. There was also no control group - no patients in the study who were not given the operation and whose condition could be compared with those who had the treatment.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Research fraud among doctors who want the kudos and money that go with publication in a leading medical journal is a problem that is \"surfacing like a decomposing corpse\" and yet the guardians of medical integrity are not taking the necessary steps to stamp it out, according to editors. Yesterday the editors of three of the most prestigious medical publications in the UK, Richard Horton of the Lancet, Richard Smith of the British Medical Journal, and Michael Farthing of Gut, denounced the General Medical Council and the Royal Colleges for failing to set up a national body to root out the fraudsters and deter others from faking research results. A year ago, they say in a letter to be published in their journals this week, the GMC and the colleges promised to act, but they had not. Dr Horton said that the medical institutions had been promising to take fraud seriously ever since the journal editors set up the Committee on Publication Ethics as a forum in which to discuss research misconduct. \"The GMC and the Royal Colleges have not shown the resolve they said they would show,\" he said at the launch of the COPE's third annual report yesterday. Last week the GMC found a consultant surgeon, Anjan Banerjee, guilty of serious professional misconduct for publishing an article in Gut that contained information that had been deliberately falsified. It took 10 years to bring him to book. While a junior doctor at King's College Hospital Mr Banerjee carried out a study investigating drug-induced damage to the small intestine. Not only was it published in Gut but it also went out as an abstract at a scientific meeting. Mr Banerjee based his results on the urine samples of \"12 healthy patients\". It was in fact his own urine. \"Dr Banerjee was suspended and not struck off, in spite of the finding of fact about fraud,\" said Dr Horton. He attacked the Academy of Medical Sciences, which acts as an umbrella body for all the royal colleges. It ought to be taking the lead in fighting misconduct, he said. \"They have been especially negligent with respect to promoting research integrity. They have issued two sets of guidelines, neither of which deal with research misconduct when they should have done.\" The GMC is deep in a process of reform, revising its constitution and reviewing the way it disciplines doctors. Only last month, Dr Horton said, the academy gave its advice. \"It was the best opportunity any independent body has had in recent years to strengthen the GMC's resolve in respect of misconduct.\" But instead, they said they had grave misgivings about making the GMC more accountable to the public. \"They are more concerned about protecting the profession,\" he said. The COPE's annual report is only a snapshot of the sort of research misconduct that is taking place, its members believe. The cases it discusses are only those which are raised at meetings by a journal editor who has nagging doubts about a paper that has been submitted for publication. Although papers are always sent for peer review to other scientists in the field, fraud is hidden and malpractice - such as a failure to ask the ethics committee for approval or the patients for consent - will not be picked up. The COPE has dealt with 110 cases by now, 30 of which came to light this year. There must be many more. \"Many, many editors in Britain don't bring cases to COPE,\" said Dr Smith. \"We have no idea still what fraction of the whole this represents,\" said Professor Farthing.\" Not all of them involve fraud - a common complaint is that research studies are submitted to more than one journal. In the case of a successful drug trial, this could make it appear as if there is more evidence for its safety and efficacy than really exists. Not all doctors agree there is a problem and if there is, then some argue about the solution. Richard Peto, the professor of epidemiology at Oxford University, famous for his work on the link between smoking and cancer, opposes the establishment of any new body that may impede scientists. He argues that scientists are already subject to \"harassment and hassle\" from ethics committees and other bureaucracies. Other cases include the British Medical Journal being sent a paper for publication from a surgeon who claimed to have a new treatment for migraine. His big idea was to put stitches in an artery that runs down the outside of the head. He claimed to have carried out the operation on 1,200 patients. \"There is no clear definition of how the diagnosis (of migraine) was made,\" says the COPE report. There was also no control group - no patients in the study who were not given the operation and whose condition could be compared with those who had the treatment.",

      "bodyText": "The government must \"grasp the nettle\" and relax UK radio ownership, according to the head of the market-leading GWR Group. Ralph Bernard, GWR chief executive, said: \"The government has clearly spent time thinking about TV ownership and not enough on radio ownership. TV always gets the headlines.\" Yesterday's communications white paper made it clear that the government would consider a \"fairer regime\" for radio ownership, which could completely replace the existing radio points system. GWR's portfolio is currently restricted to owning 38 local licences and the Classic FM station. The UK commercial radio industry has been clamouring for the chance to reduce the number of players in the sector from around 12 to three, which would spark a multimillion pound acquisition spree. The first sign of intent has been Scottish media giant SMG's move for Scottish Radio Holdings, which owns the Radio Clyde and Radio Forth stations. Shares in SRH yesterday soared 122.5p to 1620p after it appointed advisers for a sale. However, Mr Bernard said there will still be a high degree of manouevring among the big players, which include Emap and Capital Radio. He believes the points system will eventually be scrapped, as the Radio Authority and all the leading companies are determined to have it replaced. \"There are ways of making adjustments to your station portfolio in order to accommodate acquisitions. There is nothing in the white paper which will prevent the eventual consolidation of UK commercial radio,\" he added.

      "body": "<p>Amid all the political posturing and the volley of statistics surrounding the issue of illegal immigration into the United Kingdom, it is an image which suddenly humanises the cross-Channel trade in stowaways. The Iraqi baby seems dazed, oblivious to the flashbulbs popping around her; her outsized pink bobble-hat strikes an incongruous note on the rain-sodden Calais docks. She has spent the previous few hours hidden in the back of a lorry bound for Dover, and much of the past month in similar conditions on the arduous trek from Turkey across Europe. But for now her family's covert journey to England is on hold, interrupted by security guards hired to search every truck making the crossing for signs of stowaways, smuggled on board for \u00a3400 a time. </p> <p>This much is common knowledge; P&amp;O Stena's newly toughened stance against illegal immigration has been a public relations coup for the ferry operator. What happens next is not. </p> <p>If she is lucky, the baby girl will be bundled into a taxi by waiting police. Otherwise, her family will have a 12-kilometre walk along windswept motorways to their temporary home, the Red Cross reception centre near the coastal suburb of Sangatte - a huge, mud-green factory shed on a hill overlooking the Channel. Providing basic shelter and food to a constantly changing population of mainly Iraqis, Kurds, Palestinians, North Africans and Kosovars, it is a place without equal in western Europe: a refugee camp that feels like the edge of the world, but is actually a matter of minutes by car from the hypermarkets flogging cut-price beer and wine to booze-cruising Brits. </p> <p>No questions are asked of the clandestines who pass in straggling groups through the camp gates. The authorities prefer it that way. Without any system of registration, the asylum-seekers are free to launch multiple attempts at the illegal crossing without explicit French backing. </p> <p>\"The doors are open, but it is a kind of prison,\" says Maher, a 32-year-old Palestinian computer programmer idling near the town hall, where somebody has scrawled graffiti labelling the local population xenophobes and Nazis. A journey he had planned for years and which has taken him two months so far is an hour's ferry ride from completion. \"People are losing their minds in there,\" he says, gesturing towards the camp. </p> <p>Sangatte's open-door policy is not extended to journalists, who are stopped at the gate. Stung by local criticisms that the centre is wasting millions of francs on \"bogus\" asylum-seekers, the Red Cross, a spokesman says, has made it \"a basic principle\" not to admit the press. But Maher reckons I could pass as Albanian, and sure enough, it proves easy to slip past the Red Cross marshals in the guise of an asylum-seeker. </p> <p>The first thing that hits you is the stench from the toilet sheds wafting into the air which, at 5pm, is already seriously cold. Nearby, immigrants with children live in 20 Portakabins, around 25 people to each; they are divided into individual rooms of about three square metres by scraps of fabric hung from the wall. Maher and I are not so lucky. Our accommodation is in the military-style tents towards the back of the warehouse, where young men sleep 14 to a tent on narrow plastic hammocks. There are about 700 people in residence at the moment, but with fewer ferry crossings over Christmas, the Red Cross fears their numbers will rise steeply. </p> <p>Most, with the exception of the Kurds, are articulate English speakers, often with university degrees and a scattering of PhDs. Many are frighteningly well read. Maher's conversation is peppered with references to Heidegger and Foucault, while Latif, a young Afghan who says he is fleeing the Taliban in fear of violent reprisals for his political views, frames his argument in terms of phenomenological philosophy. It is hard to avoid the feeling that their intellectual backgrounds make the indignities of daily life at Sangatte all the greater. </p> <p>\"We are very grateful to the French, but some of them, even the Red Cross, they treat us like animals,\" says Jouan, a mild-mannered lecturer who has travelled from Syria in the backs of trucks with one change of clothes, a guitar and a dog-eared Arabic copy of Nietzsche's Beyond Good and Evil. He was imprisoned, he says, because he had links with Amnesty International. His brother and sister are still serving 12-year sentences for membership of the Communist party. But his wealthy father bought him a 24-hour visit home and he took a midnight lift to the border. \"The way they look at us, they treat us like we are nothing,\" he says of the camp staff. \"I suppose we are nothing. But we were something.\" </p> <p>Like Jouan, many in the centre are escaping political imprisonment or violence, but others freely admit to motives usually considered suspect in the UK and France alike: the fulfilment of entrepreneurial or academic ambitions cut short, they say, by the UN embargo on Iraq, or the Israeli government, or the Taliban. There are plenty of economic migrants among the political ones, but listening to them, it soon becomes hard to see a dividing line between the two. </p> <p>Dinner, served on long tables lined with benches, consists of some dubious chunks of pinkish meat - \"crazy cow,\" Latif guesses - and rice with peas. But we're among the last to eat, and as we try to leave we are pushed back by Red Cross staff, shouting \"Hey mistair!\", and thrusting cloths and buckets of water at us, refusing to open the metal gates of the eating area until we've sponged down the tables and benches. </p> <p>It is a perfectly reasonable request, of course, but something about the way it is made goes to the heart of the camp residents' troubled relationship with the Red Cross. Stories abound of staff displaying what the asylum seekers interpret as contempt, locking them out of the showers, denying them hot water to wash clothes, waking them loudly at night while carrying out routine patrols. \"Washing all our family's clothes in one tiny bucket of cold water, it's no way to live,\" says one woman. It is an attitude that it would be easy to interpret as ingratitude if one was so inclined. </p> <p>\"They're doing what they can, I suppose, but they could knock this place down, and we would still find a way,\" says Maher, disappearing to begin the nightly process of \"borrowing\" extra blankets from neighbouring tents. Opinions towards the French police are much harder: two Middle Eastern asylum seekers show numerous scars on their shoulders and arms they insist come not from mistreatment in their homelands but from the truncheons of port police. </p> <p>Time stretches and yawns at the camp; with only a single television and a couple of old five-a-side football goals, most people seem to while away the hours smoking and pacing the warehouse floor. Ali, a portly 40-year-old Iraqi who had an English girlfriend before diplomatic relations soured, spends most of his time standing at the door of the building, positioned by cruel chance to provide a constant frieze of ferries plying the Channel. \"On a clear night people say you can see the lights on the other side,\" he says, but he's not sure he believes them: during the two winter weeks he has spent making nightly attempts at passage to England, he can't remember any clear nights. </p> <p>The halogen lamps flooding the warehouse are shut off and we return to our tents. Around 3am, a gnawing cold sets in. Every noise is magnified by the echoing concrete, but soon the rain starts to hammer deafeningly on the corrugated iron roof, dripping through onto our tents. \"Listen,\" shouts Ali, as if it were possible to do anything else. \"There's a war outside.\" At some point in the night we are joined by four Ethiopians, pulled off lorries at the docks hours before. Exhausted, they sleep through the cacophany, but for everyone else, sleep is fitful, punctuated by hacking coughs and children crying. </p> <p>The England that dominates their thoughts is a strange place - \"a completely inaccurate vision of Eldorado\" is how the camp's deputy director, Michel Meriaux, puts it. For all of them, it is the ne plus ultra of democracy and human rights, a place where work permits are easy to come by - certainly far easier than in mainland Europe - and accommodation not so hard to find; for some, it is a stepping-stone to the US and Canada. </p> <p>For Ali, who studied at Teesside Polytechnic in the 1970s, it is: \"cheese and onion crisps . . . a pint of beer for about a pound, I think\"; summer weekends in Neath; a kebab shop on the Old Brompton Road. \"England is a place where they really value the past, hold on to historic things,\" he says. </p> <p>Curiously, it is a vision which recalls nothing so much as John Major's picture of foggy cricket grounds and bicycling spinsters. </p> <p>What it is, is a place where they do expect to have to work: work, after all, is precisely the point of the voyage for most. I ask Jouan, the lecturer and Nietzsche reader, about his professional ambitions. \"A job,\" he says. \"Just any job, really.\" The glowing tip of Maher's roll-up pierces the darkness. \"Baudelaire had something to say about all this,\" he sighs. \"You've read Baudelaire?\" </p> <p> ' It's tonight, I think,\" says a man who tells me I can call him Mohammed, though he won't reveal his real name or country of origin. After breakfast - bread and tea or coffee - he outlines his plan: he has made a deal with \"a friend in Calais\" whom he is to meet at the ferry terminal tonight. He reckons I might be getting a taxi back to the city soon, and charmingly informs me that he will be sharing it. </p> <p>Back in Calais, he explains that he wants to cover the final distance to the terminal alone, and catches one of the free transfer buses provided by the ferry operators. By the time I reach the terminal later that evening, he could be any one of the hunched figures scrambling up motorway embankments, hiding under bridges, slipping in and out of the shadows in the lorry parks, hardened against the wind and the hammering rain by the dream of stumbling, a few hours later, into the grey half-light of a Dover dawn.</p>",

Mr Balls says these problems have been addressed, with extra money, better focus for RDAs on economic development and regeneration, and greater flexibility for RDAs to shift resources to local priorities. \"In return, the RDAs will have to demonstrate top class leadership, coordinate with other regional and local partners and be more accountable for their actions - locally, regionally and nationally.\" The pamphlet reveals how Yorkshire Forward, which covers Yorkshire and Humberside has signed up to measurable targets, including the creation of 150,000 jobs by 2010 and doubling the rate of small business start-ups. Mr Healey concludes that a report on Labour's first term might read: \"Slow start. shows promise\". He suggests a long term strategy that aims for a wider spread of economic assets such as airports, universities, research labs and government offices will be essential.",

      "bodyText": "The government backed away from a confrontation with broadcasters and newspaper tycoons yesterday when it published its long-awaited blueprint for the digital age. In a white paper billed as a radical reform of media regulation, ministers appeared to have sidestepped the most controversial issues ahead of a general election. BBC governors retain their powers to police the corporation; the strict rules that barred the way to a single ITV network are swept away; and Channel 4 won its battle against privatisation. Ministers delayed potentially sensitive reforms of the rules on newspaper takeovers and cross-media ownership. The communications white paper proposes that a single, powerful regulator will cover broadcasting, telecommunications and new media. The body will have wide-ranging controls to maintain standards, ensure that no single company dominates the market, and will even attempt to police the internet. Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said \"light-touch\" regulation would allow Britain's media industry to compete on a world stage, but the interests of consumers would remain paramount. Stephen Byers, the trade secretary, appeared to concede the proposals had not gone as far as expected: \"The white paper does take a balanced approach and some may criticise us for that.\" But he said the plans provide for \"intelligent and modern regulation\".

      "body": "<p>The recently reported death of two teenage girls in a gas-filled car is deeply shocking. Why would two young women, we wonder, choose to die in a suicide pact? Sadly, though, teenage suicide is not rare. After 1945, the rate of teenage suicide around the world began to rise significantly. In more recent years, the rate for young women has levelled out. The rate for young men, however, has continued to rise, possibly because many, faced with a dearth of traditional jobs and roles for men, have felt that society had no place for them. </p> <p>The legal tradition has been to regard suicide as an act committed when the balance of the mind is disturbed - that is, as a permanent or temporary madness. This formulation does not, of course, explain why a person commits suicide. Suicidal thoughts are considered to be a symptom of depression, but while all depressed people contemplate suicide as a way of escaping their misery, not all depressed people even attempt suicide; and it is by no means certain that everyone who commits suicide is depressed. What is possible is to explain suicide in terms of what it is to be a person. </p> <p>Each of us is keenly aware of being a person, that which we each call I, myself. This sense of being a person is made up of a structure of all our ideas, attitudes, opinions, memories and feelings. Within this structure are some central ideas about who we are and what our moral stance must be. Our sense of being a person is what we hold most dear, and our every decision and action is aimed in part at preserving our being that person. </p> <p>But we also strive to survive as a physical body. For most of our lives, surviving as a person and as a body go together. A situation can arise, though, where we have to sacrifice one or the other. Suppose, as a loving parent, you find yourself and your child in some dangerous situation where only one of you can survive. Do you sacrifice yourself or your child? Your choice is simple. You die in order that your child will live. You sacrifice your body in order to continue being what you value most, a loving parent. You know that if you chose otherwise and lived while your child died, you would have failed yourself. This may seem an extreme example, and yet the mechanism is common: many of the people who suffer depression or post-traumatic stress disorder after a disaster believe that the only way they could have continued to be the person they once valued would have been to have died in the disaster. </p> <p>Some people abandon their bodies when they realise that the world no longer offers them the supports they know are essential to the maintenance of themselves as a person. Some of them simply lose the will to live. Others contract a survivable illness and yet die. Research shows that a significant number of widowers (though, curiously, not widows) die within a year of their wives' deaths. </p> <p>The will to live can be very strong, and so some people who feel that their situation will not allow them to be themselves choose to kill their body in order to be the person they know themselves to be. If they cannot live as themselves, they will die as themselves. In killing themselves, they leave a message to the world at large and to some, if not all, of their nearest and dearest. Their written message might be: \"You will be better off without me.\" But the subtext is: \"You have failed to be what I wanted you to be.\" Many of the parents of teenage suicides understand that this is the message and torture themselves with guilt. </p> <p>Guilt is very familiar to parents, aware that none of us is perfect. Teenagers, suicidal or not, make life difficult for parents precisely because children are reluctant to accept that they have less than perfect parents. Part of the process of growing up is learning to accept the fallibility of our parents and the impossibility of the world ever being what we want it to be. When we are teenagers everything matters enormously. Yet in life things rarely turn out the way we expect. We come to accept compromise as wisdom, rather than as a betrayal of ideals. Adults can help teenagers arrive at such wisdom by listening and discussing, while refraining from criticism and instruction. </p> <p>One common feature of teenage suicide is that the young person felt that there was no one who would listen. The Samaritans offer a special service to teenagers who find they have no one to talk to. Listening to your children is not easy, because you will hear a great deal that you may wish you had not heard, chiefly accounts of your shortcomings. But if you find you can, then you will have given your children the greatest gift: the gift of being listened to and accepted. </p> <p>\u0095 Dorothy Rowe is the author of Breaking the Bonds: Understanding Depression and Finding Freedom (HarperCollins, \u00a39.99).</p>",

But this paper gives no clues about what kind of scheduling, programmes or news bulletins the ordinance entails, nor the role of the regulator in securing quality. </p> <p>Unified regulation of communications has been coming for a while. There cannot be separate regulators for the streamed programming we might soon receive on a telephone handset and the programming - its content perhaps the same - we get over the air on a radio set. But the white paper stops well short of standardisation. The proposed Ofcom will have oversight of films shown on television and the internet while the British Board of Film Classification continues to review the same material for cinema exhibition. An anomaly. Yet the paper does seek general principles to apply to damming, diverting and monitoring the flood of communications, old and new. Sadly, it focuses on the promotion of competition between media companies, as if content were secondary. </p> <p>But content is about collective identity, the life of mind, politics. As predicted, the weakest part of the paper has to do with media ownership, including newspapers. The government was going to discuss \"voice share\" as a criterion in judging mergers. But now, on the eve of an election, the Blairites have no desire to provoke the moguls, despite their vituperative treatment of Labour over Europe and other issues. Indeed, the white paper toys with the fashionable theory that market share in the media does not matter: internet pluralism will wash away the sins of concentration. This is nonsense. Media products are not like retail groceries or financial services.</p> <p> A government as concerned about education as this one should be passionately aware of the educative potential of the media. Over the past eight decades much of that has been carried by the BBC, but there is nothing to be gleaned here about its role or funding, after the current settlement ends. If a single company takes over independent television, we are left in the dark about what its obligations to the public might be, beyond some pabulum about regions and religion. </p> <p>The paper has green gills. Plenty of time then to seek to strengthen media regulation that does not have Rupert Murdoch firmly in its sights. Joining up the regulation of the internet, mobile phones and so on is important; ditto the transfer from analogue to digital broadcasting. But Samuel Goldwyn's aphorism - if you want to send a message, use Western Union - needs revisiting. Broadcasting is about messages, so a regulatory regime suited to common carriers for whom content is secondary is bound to be deficient.</p>",

There cannot be separate regulators for the streamed programming we might soon receive on a telephone handset and the programming - its content perhaps the same - we get over the air on a radio set. But the white paper stops well short of standardisation. The proposed Ofcom will have oversight of films shown on television and the internet while the British Board of Film Classification continues to review the same material for cinema exhibition. An anomaly. Yet the paper does seek general principles to apply to damming, diverting and monitoring the flood of communications, old and new. Sadly, it focuses on the promotion of competition between media companies, as if content were secondary. But content is about collective identity, the life of mind, politics. As predicted, the weakest part of the paper has to do with media ownership, including newspapers. The government was going to discuss \"voice share\" as a criterion in judging mergers. But now, on the eve of an election, the Blairites have no desire to provoke the moguls, despite their vituperative treatment of Labour over Europe and other issues. Indeed, the white paper toys with the fashionable theory that market share in the media does not matter: internet pluralism will wash away the sins of concentration. This is nonsense. Media products are not like retail groceries or financial services. A government as concerned about education as this one should be passionately aware of the educative potential of the media. Over the past eight decades much of that has been carried by the BBC, but there is nothing to be gleaned here about its role or funding, after the current settlement ends. If a single company takes over independent television, we are left in the dark about what its obligations to the public might be, beyond some pabulum about regions and religion. The paper has green gills. Plenty of time then to seek to strengthen media regulation that does not have Rupert Murdoch firmly in its sights. Joining up the regulation of the internet, mobile phones and so on is important; ditto the transfer from analogue to digital broadcasting. But Samuel Goldwyn's aphorism - if you want to send a message, use Western Union - needs revisiting. Broadcasting is about messages, so a regulatory regime suited to common carriers for whom content is secondary is bound to be deficient.",

George Bush Senior, the former US president, said before one of the string of key court decision's: \"Whatever happens this time, my pride and Barbara's pride knows no bounds.\" John Ellis, Mr Bush's cousin, says that there exists an \"old man's network\" that is hoping to benefit from Mr Bush coming to power. He said: \"It is probably 50,000 people, and they were looking for some kind of vindication. I don't think you can possibly overrate the hatred of Bill Clinton in the Republican party.\" An anonymous Texan Democrat consultant described Mr Bush as \"the boy in the bubble of infotainment.\" Andrew Gumbel, of the Independent, said: \"Just how wild was the young George W Bush, exactly? Did he sniff cocaine? Did he sleep around and get young women pregnant? Did he use his wealth, his privileged background and the connections of his politician father to cover up for his more excessive behaviour? And, if he did, how bad does it need to have been before people worry about his suitability for high public office?\" Johnny Paul Penry, who is on death row in Texas for rape and murder and whose case has been used by opponents of Mr Bush, said: \"I think it's a cruel thing to do, to put me to sleep.\" Official George W Bush sites George W Bush: official site Bush's policies Bush/Cheney: official transition site Unofficial George W Bush sites Bushisms George W Bush speaks The Bush files Son of Bush Bush watch",

Equally, two of the four Washington supremes who went against Bush last Saturday were appointed by Republican presidents - one of them by Bush's father.</p> <p>Still, even if partisanship is not yet an all-consuming disease, the division is real enough. November's was the closest election in US history, not just in Florida but everywhere. Gore's final victory margin in New Mexico was less than 400 votes; his edge in the entire country just 300,000 out of 100m votes, three-tenths of 1%.

America's previous periods of great political division were matched by vast cultural rifts. The nation was split not just by electoral arithmetic but in hard, bloody fact. So the photo-finish election of 1876 was an after-shock of the civil war of a decade earlier. The same is true of the impeachment crisis of that same period, which saw Abraham Lincoln's successor, Andrew Johnson, survive an attempt to remove him from office by a single senate vote.</p> <p>In our own time, the symptoms are identical - impeachment rapidly fol lowed by a bitterly contested election - but what is the disease? What cultural divide will future historians blame for the institutional rupture of today?</p> <p>It's a puzzle, if only because Washington's institutions were much less split during periods of far greater civil unease - say the McCarthyite wars of the 1950s or the generational, sexual and racial upheavals of the 1960s - than they are today. What great gash is it that tears America apart in these peaceful, prosperous days of the early 21st century?</p> <p>The answer may be in what the failed, rightwing candidate Pat Buchanan calls the culture wars.

Twelve radioactive particles have been found around the Caithness facility in the past year, but the latest had a higher level of radioactivity and was discovered in an area thought clear of contamination. The material was found on December 4 near Dounreay Castle, an area accessible to the public with company permission, during part of a six-monthly monitoring programme carried out by the UK Atomic Energy Authority. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency said the find was a \"significant development\" because it appeared to rule out the theory that particles discovered over recent years had been washed up by the sea. The theory of sea to land transfers of radioactive material stems from an incident in the 1960s which led to huge numbers of particles being washed down on to the seabed. The Scottish environment agency said the UKAEA should now launch an urgent, detailed investigation into how the particle came to be deposited. Lorraine Mann of the campaigning group Scotland Against Nuclear Dumping said the discovery was \"possibly the worst and most understated leak from a nuclear plant in the developed world\". She added: \"This is a devastating discovery and UKAEA must now be prosecuted for their ongoing negligence.

The outgoing president, his wife Hillary and daughter Chelsea received a rapturous welcome in Dublin and in the border town of Dundalk, on the first day of a two-day tour. But while breakthrough is not expected during talks with key politicians in Belfast today, the president urged all sides not to give up trying to overcome the deadlock between Unionists and Republicans over decommissioning and demilitarisation. \"We've got to keep going, reversal is not an option,\" said Mr Clinton. \"The people want this to go on and I think the leaders have to find a way through the last three or four difficult issues and I think it can be done.\" London, Dublin and Washington have played down hopes of major progress during this visit but they are optimistic Mr Clinton could provide the catalyst to create a better climate for agreement in the next few weeks. Northern Ireland secretary Peter Mandelson said: \"President Clinton will help give people the confidence to move forward together. \"He is a cross between a thoroughly charming, charismatic man and a political computer.

He sipped some of the black stuff at Mr Ahern's local pub, Fagan's, before greeting wellwishers and buying some Christmas gifts with Hillary and Chelsea in the city's fashionable shopping streets. But underneath all the joviality, there is a serious and passionate message about the process he has been closely involved with during the eight years of his presidency. This is his third visit to Ireland, he is the only serving US president to go to Northern Ireland, and he has kept in regular contact with all the key players in the peace process, phoning them with encouragement in the vital hours leading up to the signing of the Good Friday agreement two years ago. The fact that he chose the dissident Republican stronghold of Dundalk to deliver a keynote speech is also being read as a powerful signal of his call for everyone to leave violence behind and move forward together. Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams and the party's chief negotiator Martin McGuinness were among the tens of thousands gathered to welcome him in the County Louth town, infamous as the place where security chiefs believe the renegade Real IRA planned the Omagh bomb which killed 29 people and unborn twins in 1998. Sinn Fein is urging the government to scale down security in nearby South Armagh but sources said this was unlikely while the threat from dissidents remained. Republicans are also furious at Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble's ban on its ministers attending cross-border institutions set up under the Good Friday agreement and they will challenge the veto in court in Belfast this Friday. But Mr Trimble insists his ban is justified because of the IRA's failure to re-engage with General John de Chastelaine's decommissioning body and make serious progress towards getting rid of its weapons. Mr Clinton and the British prime minister Tony Blair are discussing these stumbling blocks with Mr Trimble, Mr Adams and other political leaders at Stormont today.",

But, in fact, it is the vehicle for two very ambitious Irish property tycoons to get a chunk of London's real estate using Mr Bourne as the front door. Despite being cleared by the Cabinet Office's official scrutineers to become the government's \"preferred bidder\" for the site, their reputation in Dublin is highly contentious. Richard Barrett and John Ronan - the two developers behind the Irish company Treasury Holdings - are the real owners of Legacy and will be putting up 80% of the cash to transform the dome site into \"Knowledge City\". Mr Barrett, 46, a lawyer, and Mr Ronan, 47, an accountant, have been accused of being \"deliberate liars\" in the Irish parliament and have been involved in 38 legal actions in the past six years.

The colours, representing not the British but the American flag, hung side by side with the bold green and orange of the Irish tricolour. An American president was in town and the town was out to celebrate. To those who know little of the Troubles the choice of Dundalk for the visit of the world's most powerful man would seem as reasonable as any other town nestled in the Irish countryside. Indeed the official reason given for this choice of venue for a speech on President Clinton's trip was that the County Louth town was a symbol of the new Ireland, having turned itself into an economic powerhouse, with no little help from US investment. But the Clinton cavalcade entering this town, just across the border from South Armagh, had a resonance far beyond its new prosperity. Its image has been tainted by the belief that the town harbours members of the Real IRA responsible for the Omagh bomb, which killed 29 people. Now a bustling industrial base, neat and practical rather than pretty, it is proud of developments such as the \u00a3180m Xerox plant, which will employ 2,000. Yesterday carnival costumes were everywhere, Irish dancers mixed with the local samba band, and strains of Danny Boy, apparently the president's favourite song, sung by Belfast man Brian Kennedy, could be heard all day long. Even the driving rain failed to dampen the spirits of those who have come to see the man credited as a major inspiration to the peace process. It is clear that the president is here to deliver a message - isolate the terrorists who belong in the past and move forward to a better future. \"We were surprised he was coming here but this visit is symbolic,\" said 20-year-old Jonathan Gorham. \"He's making a point. A minority of people want to continue violence but the majority just want to get on with their lives. \"There's a certain hardline element wherever you go, you can't blame one town,\" said Patrick Connaughton, 80. \"Clinton's showing he knows not all the bad eggs are in one bucket.

The pair were key figures in the 32 County Sovereignty movement, the political wing of the Real IRA. Now their shop is dark and empty, post piling up in the doorway, as Christmas shoppers hurry in and out of the well-lit units all around. While locals are keen to point out the town's friendliness, they are more reticent about sharing their opinions of those hardliners. \"A few gangsters spoil it for a lot of decent people,\" said one police officer. Antrim man Ambrose O'Neill made the trip south because he thinks he will get closer to the president. \"He's done a lot for peace,\" he said, \"and he could teach our politicians a thing or two.\" Security was never tighter in Dundalk, every drain and alleyway searched and sealed by the American secret service. Local police had done their utmost to ensure no leading dissidents got close enough to be photographed with the president. But Mr Clinton, who brought Sinn Fein in from the political cold when he first granted Gerry Adams a US visa in 1994, would have known that somewhere, lurking in the back of the crowd or watching television in the pub, might be those still sympathetic to the dissident cause. They are the ones he is courageously facing down when he tells people to leave violence behind. Unlike the good cowboy, who rides into town and manages to sort out the situation in just two hours, Clinton is not naive enough to imagine he will change minds overnight. Just as when he talks to key Northern Ireland politicians in Belfast today, he knows he might not produce a magic formula to solve the current deadlock, but hopes his visit can be a catalyst toward creating the right atmosphere for change. But by opening his arms to Dundalk, he is showing people he does not demonise them because of a minority in their midst and that he hopes the impact of his visit will help them exorcise some of the past which haunts their town.",

Then, he aped the kind of resignation speech that any western politician might make, even though 24 hours before he had sent in the tanks. His Socialist party has splintered and suffered a rash of resignations since his regime was defeated in September elections, when the Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS) had a landslide victory at presidential, federal and local level. Latest opinion polls show that support for Mr Milosevic's party has dropped dramatically since then, from 24% in September to 16% now, while support for DOS has almost doubled from 32% to 61%.

According to Aleksandar Tijanic, a Belgrade columnist and a minister of information for Mr Milosevic some years ago: \"They are guarded by a unit of police bodyguards and by a section of the elite guard.\" The bodyguards are not under government jurisdiction, he said. There is a strong desire in Serbia to see Mr Milosevic brought to justice, but most people want him to be tried in Serb courts and for corruption rather than for war crimes at the Hague.

During a live programme, Ask the Prime Minister, he also confessed his helplessness to improve the NHS quickly enough to ease the suffering of a woman whose 87-year-old mother has been told she must wait 68 weeks to see an orthopaedic surgeon.</p> <p>In an emotional exchange Mr Blair told the distressed woman: \"I accept it is my responsibilty to turn this situation around.

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair last night admitted that rail travel in Britain has become an \"absolute hell\" and warned Railtrack that if the situation is not drastically improved by late January ministers will impose their own less severe speed restrictions. While he stressed the importance of rail safety he also betrayed evident frustration at the long delays caused by emergency track repairs - not justified by the real risk involved, the prime minister hinted during his hour long ITV grilling. During a live programme, Ask the Prime Minister, he also confessed his helplessness to improve the NHS quickly enough to ease the suffering of a woman whose 87-year-old mother has been told she must wait 68 weeks to see an orthopaedic surgeon. In an emotional exchange Mr Blair told the distressed woman: \"I accept it is my responsibilty to turn this situation around. I am trying to do it, I am trying my very level best to do it.\" Immediately challenged to say why he and Gordon Brown had not spent more on public services like the NHS earlier in Labour's three year term the prime minister insisted they had been determined to ease crippling debt repayments - larger \"than the whole of the school system\" - and to avoid Tory boom and bust in the economy. In a rare breach of the night's good-tempered but highlyassertive cross-examination by an audience at Yorkshire TV's Leeds studio - and telephone callers around the country - Mr Blair was stung by one hurled taunt on tight public spending limits to say: \"I don't intend to become a leftwing Margaret Thatcher. That is not what I am about.\" He confessed repeatedly that shortages of doctors and nurses, not cash, are the NHS's biggest problem. But in a flurry of agonised complaints from struggling doctors, teachers and a London policeman's wife the post-Hatfield rail crisis raised most anger. \"Just because they (Railtrack) say there is a minimal amount of risk you've got to test what they say... but there is a certain amount of risk paralysis creeping in,\" said Mr Blair who faced waves of voter indignation over the failing state of key public services, notably the NHS, crime, schools and transport. Asked if he experienced directly what he had earlier called the \"absolute hell to travel on the railways at the present time\",\" Mr Blair said he had - and during the journey \"had ample opportunity to hear the views of commuters which are very strong\". If the system is not largely back to normal by the end of January, ministers will intervene to impose their own guidelines, he said, though he also pointed out that even ultra-moden rail systems like Germany's still have crashes. To all his questioners Mr Blair was forced to admit \"there is a limit to what we can do\" or - on extra pay for nurses, police and teachers - \"it may not be enough or as much as people want, but it is a big start\". On the single currency issue he reminded viewers that Labour has promised a referendum so that voters will decide. Asked if he would copy Denmark and repeat the referendum if he got a No he replied: \"No, I don't think that would be very wise.\"",

The billionaire entrepeneur, whose fortune was consolidated in Florida and the tiny ex-colony of Belize, intervened in the Queen's speech debate on foreign policy to denounce \"the cancer\" of drugs in the Caribbean - and to plead with the government not to abandon its four remaining overseas territories.

      "bodyText": "The Countryside Alliance is poised to launch a challenge under the Human Rights Act to the government's bill banning hunting if, as expected, MPs vote for an outright ban. A leading human rights barrister, Edward Fitzgerald QC, said there was a \"strong case\" for arguing that a ban on hunting would breach rights to enjoyment of property and respect for private life guaranteed by the European convention on human rights. The alliance, the main pro-hunting lobby group, plans to challenge the statement by the home secretary, Jack Straw, that the bill complies with the convention. Since October, when the Human Rights Act came into force, making the convention part of UK law, new bills must include either a \"statement of compatibility\" with the convention, or a statement that the government wants parliament to proceed without one. The Home Office said: \"The home secretary made his statement on the basis of the best legal advice available. If the Alliance wants to challenge it, that's a matter for them.\" The bill, which will have its second reading in the Commons next Monday, will allow MPs a free vote on three options: a ban on hunting with hounds, a \"middle way\" under which hunting would be regulated by statute, or a system of self-regulation put forward by the Countryside Alliance. Labour MPs are expected to vote for a ban. The Commons voted for a ban three years ago when a Labour member put forward a private member's bill which ran out of time. An alliance spokesman said: \"If MPs are unwise enough to try to vote through an outright ban on hunting with dogs it is highly likely that we will be challenging the government's awarding of that certificate to that bill.\" An inquiry under the former senior treasury official Lord Burns, set up by the government to look into a possible ban on hunting, warned that any ban could face challenges under the Human Rights Act. Mr Fitzgerald said: \"There is a strong case that a ban on hunting, backed by criminal sanctions, interferes with the right to the peaceful enjoyment of property, protected by article 1 of protocol 1 [of the convention] and the right to respect for private life guaranteed by article 8.\" Interference can be justified, but in the case of enjoyment of property the state would have to show that it struck a balance between the interests of the community and the protection of the right to peaceful enjoyment of property. In the case of the right to private life, the state can only interfere to protect morals, prevent crime or disorder, or prevent offence to religious or other sensibilities. It would also have to show the ban was proportionate and necessary. Mr Fitzgerald said protecting animals from unnecessary suffering could come under the protection of morals. But the onus would be on the state to show hunting caused more suffering than other means of killing and the court, Mr Fitzgerald said, would expect to see some legitimate scientific findings before criminalising conduct that was otherwise lawful. Deadline 2000, a coalition of animal rights groups which supports a ban, has obtained an opinion from three human rights lawyers arguing that hunting is a public activity and therefore not covered by the right to respect for private life.

      "bodyText": "The transport minister, Lord Macdonald, yesterday backed moves to end Railtrack's heavily criticised policy of sub-contracting out all track maintenance work, saying it was one of his areas of greatest concern. The sub-contracting is seen as one of the causes of the Hatfield rail crash and the subsequent panic response of checking over 3,000 separate sites of guage cracking. Lord Macdonald said yesterday the relationship between sub-contractors and Railtrack would be the central issue in the second part of the Cullen inquiry into the Hatfield rail crash. He also told members of the Commons transport committee yesterday he was deeply concerned by the skill shortages in rail maintenance. He had called in senior Railtrack managers in the wake of a Daily Mirror story showing an undercover reporter had been appointed a site access manager in charge of 18 men on one of Britain's busiest train lines. The reporter had been given just 48 hours training by Jarvis Rail, one of the six sub-contarctors working for Railtrack. The transport commitee, in a report to be published later today, is expected to slam the poor monitoring of sub-contracted work. The RMT union told the committee permanently employed maintenance workers had fallen from 31,000 in 1994 to 19,000 today. At the same time the number of casual staff had risen to 84,000. The former Railtrack chief executive, Gerald Corbett, told the committee that the number of contractors will be reduced from six to four, but said \"the whole issue of culture on the front line is going to have be addressed\". Lord Macdonald yesterday went further, agreeing Railtrack may have panicked in the wake of Hatfield because it had not been running a sensible long term track renewal programme. He said: \"Railtrack has said its relationship with management sub-contractors is not satisfactory. \"They concede they have a management responsibility and practices in the past have been inadequate. It's important for people on the ground to be under quite clear command from above and that does not always seem to have been the case.\" The committee chairwoman, Gwyneth Dunwoody, asked why the government was giving Railtrack \u00a34bn of extra cash when \"they patently cannot do the job\". Lord Macdonald produced new figures showing only 64% of Intercity trains were arriving within times set out in the revised timetables. He also revealed that even at the end of January when the bulk of the repairs are supposed to have been completed only half of all journeys will be completed within the time set before the Hatfield rail disaster. Intercity trains would be running 30 minutes late, and Anglo-Scottish trains 45 minutes late. The minister said even these improved timetables might not be met if there is bad weather or snow. The number of 20mph speed restrictions had fallen from 401 to 379, the number of 40mph restrictions had fallen from 69 to 45 and the number of 60mph restrictions had risen from 83 to 104.

The crux question is where any expansion in airports should be, given that demand from travellers is focused on London and in the south-east.</p> <p>The debate has to go wider - to the economic, social and environmental costs and benefits of aviation to society. Last year, a report by Oxford Economic Forecasting (OEF) made great claims. Aviation was said to increase UK productivity and in consequence even modest restraint on growth would have a negative impact. If air travel were constrained at 1998's levels - the starting point for the chart on the right - the economy would be \u00a330bn or 2.5% smaller in 2015 than if growth in passenger numbers could let rip. This analysis underpins the business view that, as a London Chamber of Commerce report blandly puts it, \"capacity must be provided to meet all reasonable demand\".</p> <p>But where? Between now and Christmas, the barrister Roy Vandermeer QC will hand over his report on the proposed fifth terminal at Heathrow airport (T5), marking the end of the longest planning inquiry in British history and the start of a big headache for the government. The inquiry has taken five and a half years, cost millions and divided local communities. Few doubt that Mr Vandermeer will give the go-ahead for T5. The question is what conditions will he seek to impose on noise, night flights and access to the airport by public transport.</p> <p>T5 would allow an increase in the number of passengers using Heathrow from about 60m a year to 80m, assuming existing runway capacity. But this represents only about two years of growth, at the present rate, in the number of passengers using UK airports. Air freight is growing at an even faster rate, most of it carried in passenger planes.</p> <p>Forecasts for growth over the next 30 years suggest that if it were unconstrained the number of air passengers would treble from about 180m this year to more than 500m in 2030. Even if full use were made of the existing runway capacity at all major airports, physical limits would begin to bite with a vengeance within about 10 years.</p> <p>But the OEF report that projected such increases is flawed - according to a study this week from Berkeley Hanover Consulting (BHC), which was commissioned by the strategic aviation special interest group of the Local Government Association. It argues that there is no link between growth in aviation and higher productivity. This is not necessarily surprising. A report by the standing advisory committee on trunk road assessment (Sactra) last year found no simple link between transport and economic activity, especially in a mature economy with a well-developed transport system such as the UK.</p> <p>The Oxford forecasters assumed that physical constraints would have the same effect on business and leisure air travel, when it is known that business travel is much less price sensitive and more important to the economy. More than three-quarters of air travel to and from UK air ports is for leisure, which is more price sensitive. The UK has a huge trade deficit in international tourism, about \u00a39bn in 1999.</p> <p>As the Sactra report pointed out, improving transport can just as easily suck economic activity out of a region as it can bring in new investment. Account has to be taken, too, of the economic costs of additional visitors to the UK in congesting the transport system and tourist attractions. Unconstrained growth in aviation could also unbalance regional economic development and contribute to over-heating in areas where there is already full employment. There is a good case for expanding airports outside the south-east.</p> <p>So the Oxford forecast is fatally flawed even on its own narrow terms. It still tells only part of the story, for it takes no account of aviation's wider social and environmental costs and benefits. These include, on the positive side, wider travel horizons for most of the population.</p> <p>On the negative side, they include the impact of aircraft noise on people who live near airports, under flight paths or next to busy airport road and rail links. Also to be factored in are local and global air pollution, the use of land for airport infrastructure, road and rail links. These costs are not reflected in the price of air travel and consequently the growth in air transport is environmentally unsustainable and socially inequitable.</p> <p>The economists' answer to the above would be to ensure these costs are reflected in the price of air travel on the principle that the \"polluter pays\". That would require the use of economic instruments such as taxation and emissions trading, often requiring agreement at international level so that one country's aviation industry is not disadvantaged relative to another. As events at Nice have shown, achieving agreement on fiscal matters at international level is not easy.</p> <p>The bottom line - politically difficult - is that the price of air travel will have to rise if aviation is to develop in a way that is environmentally sustainable. Such policy instruments as regulation, planning and compensation for people who are adversely affected by airport developments must also come into play.

The UK pressure for appointment only after a process of selection involving parliament should not be resisted. There will soon be in the select committee on human rights an ideal forum for such (let us call them) \"confirmation hearings\". Now everybody recoils from this because of the US experience. But there are not nearly so many controversial candidacies in the US as is widely believed, and the main ones we know about - those involving Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas - were rightly controversial in my view. US federal judges have, in the main, drawn a degree of comfort from their confirmation hearings, feeling that it has given them at least a degree of democratic legitimacy in relation to their subsequent judicial work. I also think senior UK judges will have to be prepared to meet parliament to explain in general terms what is happening in the courts under the Human Rights Act and to defend - not specific decisions but general policy developments. The committee might quite legitimately want to investigate, for example, what has happened to parliament's criminal statutes under the Human Rights Act. Or it might want to assess the cost of particular decisions, or the rationale behind some particularly controversial declaration of incompatibility. All this will be very new for the judges. But far from being antagonistic about such developments, they should welcome them. Extracted from a lecture on Monday by the professor of human rights law at King's College London",

      "body": "<p>A claim that documents were stolen to help Mohamed Al Fayed's battle with Neil Hamilton was supported by evidence that had only emerged in bizarre circumstances worthy of a Jeffrey Archer play, the appeal court heard yesterday.</p> <p>The disgraced former Conservative minister is claiming that the outcome of his failed libel action against Mr Fayed is invalid, because papers taken from his lawyer's bins were passed on to the Harrods owner.</p> <p>On the second day of Mr Hamilton's attempt to set aside the jury's verdict against him, Michael Beloff QC, for Mr Fayed, said the claim was \"so flimsy\" as not to even require a factual rebuttal.</p> <p>Lawyers for Mr Hamilton say that the papers were taken from rubbish outside the chambers of his counsel, Desmond Browne QC, by one Benjamin Pell, who makes a living from rifling the bins of the rich, famous and powerful.</p> <p>The papers were handed, Mr Hamilton claims, to a freelance journalist, Mark Hollingsworth, who has worked for Mr Fayed for some years and was employed to help him with the libel case. Mr Hamilton claims that Mr Hollingsworth was paid \u00a310,000 for the papers by Mr Fayed.</p> <p>Mr Beloff said that Mr Fayed disputed the allegation, and was available to be cross-examined if the court required. He said there was no proof that the papers had reached Mr Fayed, and he attacked Mr Pell and Mr Hollingsworth.

      "bodyText": "A claim that documents were stolen to help Mohamed Al Fayed's battle with Neil Hamilton was supported by evidence that had only emerged in bizarre circumstances worthy of a Jeffrey Archer play, the appeal court heard yesterday. The disgraced former Conservative minister is claiming that the outcome of his failed libel action against Mr Fayed is invalid, because papers taken from his lawyer's bins were passed on to the Harrods owner. On the second day of Mr Hamilton's attempt to set aside the jury's verdict against him, Michael Beloff QC, for Mr Fayed, said the claim was \"so flimsy\" as not to even require a factual rebuttal. Lawyers for Mr Hamilton say that the papers were taken from rubbish outside the chambers of his counsel, Desmond Browne QC, by one Benjamin Pell, who makes a living from rifling the bins of the rich, famous and powerful. The papers were handed, Mr Hamilton claims, to a freelance journalist, Mark Hollingsworth, who has worked for Mr Fayed for some years and was employed to help him with the libel case. Mr Hamilton claims that Mr Hollingsworth was paid \u00a310,000 for the papers by Mr Fayed. Mr Beloff said that Mr Fayed disputed the allegation, and was available to be cross-examined if the court required. He said there was no proof that the papers had reached Mr Fayed, and he attacked Mr Pell and Mr Hollingsworth. The alleged transaction between them had been a \"seedy money making exercise\". Mr Beloff said that tapes of conversations involving the pair that are being used by Mr Hamilton's side to support his case had surfaced in \"bizarre circumstances\" that would \"do credit to a play by Jeffrey Archer\". He did not spell out what the circumstances were - though on Monday the court heard that two tapes were found in a burned-out van - but went on to dismiss their content because they had clearly been edited and were out of sequence. \"They are utterly corrupt in every conceivable way.\" Mr Beloff said there was, in any case, a \"vacuum\" in Mr Hamilton's claim, in that there was no proof that any information that could have been culled from the documents had in fact been used to help Mr Fayed's case. Counsel for Mr Hamilton has argued that the papers included clear and detailed notes of how witnesses supporting Mr Fayed were to be cross-examined. Mr Beloff countered: \"They were in truth dustbin-type documents.\" Mr Hamilton has been fighting to clear his name since 1994 when the Guardian reported the \"cash-for-questions\" controversy. Mr Hamilton subsequently sued Mr Fayed over claims he made in a Channel 4 documentary that the former MP demanded and received thousands of pounds in cash, Harrods gift vouchers, and hospitality at the Ritz Hotel in Paris in return for parliamentary services. Mr Fayed pleaded justification - that the allegations were true - and the jury found in his favour. Mr Hamilton is now asking permission for a full appeal to be brought, claiming the verdict should be set aside. Yesterday his counsel, Anthony Boswood QC, compared Mr Fayed to an Olympic champion who had been found to have cheated and should pay the penalty. Mr Boswood told the court: \"He should be deprived of his medal and banned for life.\" He said judgment should be made in favour of Mr Hamilton, who would then have to consider whether to pursue damages, given that such a ruling would not clear his name. The costs orders imposed on Mr Hamilton after the libel trial should also be set aside. A \u00a32m legal bill meant he faced \"imminent bankruptcy\". Mr Beloff countered that, even if the appeal judges found in Mr Hamilton's favour, the most he would be entitled to was a re-trial. \"It would certainly not be in the public interest for him to obtain a verdict in his favour at this juncture,\" he said. Mr Fayed has been put on standby to appear in the witness box today if required. The case continues.",

He's dynamic, he's forceful, he's given good leadership on the land issue. He was elected leader of the party in December last year. Mugabe is our president and will be our candidate,\" he said.</p> <p>The country's financial and polling numbers should spell Mr Mugabe's doom as president. Inflation, unemployment and poverty surged this year as the land conflict helped contract the economy by 5%.

      "bodyText": "Zimbabwe's ruling party opens an extraordinary congress today with the one issue on everyone's lips officially off the agenda - Robert Mugabe's future. The Zanu-PF party has purged and sidelined critics of Zimbabwe's beleaguered president ahead of the meeting - and used the thuggish \"war veterans\" against dissidents in the way they were earlier used against white farmers - in an attempt to stifle accusations that Mr Mugabe is driving the party towards its doom. Issues that are on the agenda, however - including land reform - potentially open the way for more daring critics to press for the president to stand down before the 2002 election. Mr Mugabe goes into the meeting amid open hostility from former allies in the party and the tepid backing of some of his own cabinet, including the finance minister who has cast doubt on the president's leadership. But Mugabe loyalists, such as the former cabinet minister and key politburo member Nathan Shamuyarira, say there is no question of the president being challenged. \"We are quite happy with President Mugabe's leadership. He's dynamic, he's forceful, he's given good leadership on the land issue. He was elected leader of the party in December last year. Mugabe is our president and will be our candidate,\" he said. The country's financial and polling numbers should spell Mr Mugabe's doom as president. Inflation, unemployment and poverty surged this year as the land conflict helped contract the economy by 5%. Nearly half the government's expenditure is on debt interest, much of it short-term loans taken out to deal with the crisis. Spending on health is now below the level it held at independence 20 years ago, and Zimbabwe can afford only half its fuel needs. With the occupation of white-owned farms continuing, and crop production declining as a result, critical food shortages look increasingly likely. In September, a senior World Bank official in Zimbabwe, Rogier van den Brink, warned that the only way out of the crisis was for the present government to go. \"A wide cross-section of economists tend to agree that a successful political transition, as illustrated by restoration of law and order and a more pluralistic political dispensation, is the key to a suc cessful economic stabilisation and recovery,\" he said. The best hope for that transition is the 2002 presidential election. If Mr Mugabe stands again as Zanu-PF's candidate, he faces almost certain defeat in a free and fair poll. According to a comprehensive survey by South Africa's Helen Suzman Foundation in October, support for the president and the ruling party had fallen sharply since its narrow victory over the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) in parliamentary elections six months ago. Zanu-PF has the backing of just one in five voters, the survey found; three-quarters want Mr Mugabe to step down immediately, and half the voters think he should be put on trial for the Matabeleland massacres in the early 1980s and the election violence earlier this year. In contrast, just 5% of Zimbabweans blame their country's problems on the white population and more than half of voters, including a substantial number of Zanu-PF supporters, believe that whites who emigrate are an important loss to the country. With public dissatisfaction growing, it is little surprise that the party is struggling to keep a lid on internal dissent. Among the more open critics of Mr Mugabe's policies is the politburo member and former cabinet minister, Eddison Zvobgo. In September, by now out of office, he offered the most forthright denunciation of the government ever heard in parliament. \"We have tainted what was a glorious revolution, reducing it to some agrarian racist enterprise,\" he said. \"We have behaved as if the world owes us a living. It does not. We have blamed other people for each and every ill that befell us. As every peasant, worker, businessman or woman now stares at the precipice of doom, let us wake up and draw back. We must clear the slate, bury everything that has divided us, and begin again.\" Mr Zvobgo has already lost his cabinet post and the war veterans have been used to take over the party leadership in his own province, Masvingo. His days in the politburo are probably numbered but on Monday, in a sign that he speaks for more than himself, the Zanu-PF politburo said it would permit a \"Zvobgo faction\" to attend the congress. Others have been more subtle but their message is no less clear. Zimbabwe's finance minister, Simba Makoni, gives a less than wholehearted endorsement of Mr Mugabe when asked if the president can win another election. \"The majority of Zimbabweans need political leadership that leads the country out of the present social and economic problems. If President Mugabe delivers that leadership, I'm sure Zimbabweans will vote for him. If he doesn't deliver the leadership, they will not vote for him,\" he said. Is he delivering the leadership? \"Time will tell,\" he said. Some have left or been thrown out of the party for challenging Mr Mugabe's policies. Moses Mvenge, parliamentary chief whip until this year's election and a founder of Zanu-PF, won no friends for questioning excessive government spending and exposing large-scale corruption in the building of Harare's new airport. \"Zanu has one major weakness.

      "bodyText": "Many parts of England and Wales were on flood alert last night as high tides, heavy rain and strong winds combined to create severe weather conditions. Around 80 flood warnings are now in place on rivers mainly in Wales, the Midlands and southern England. There are 12 flood warnings on rivers in north Wales and three in the north-east of England. Ten severe flood warnings were in place last night: seven on the river Severn and its tributaries; on the river Teme in Worcestershire; on the river Wye in Herefordshire; and on the river Ems near Chichester in West Sussex. Areas between Gloucester and Avonmouth were expected to be dealt a double blow with a force nine gale combining with a high tide overnight. The Environment Agency said that in areas where there were flood warnings residents were being told to be prepared to evacuate their homes as there was a high probability of flooding. People living in areas where there were severe flood warningsshould expect the emergency services to call at any moment asking them to evacuate their home. Heavy rainfall which fell last weekend is now working its way down the Severn. As more rain is forecast the flood risks will remain for the next few days. A man dived into the river Leadon at Dymock in Gloucestershire to rescue a woman and her eight-month-old child who fell into the water when a wooden footbridge they were crossing gave way. Helen Dodd, a mother of two children, was walking with a friend when the accident happened on Monday afternoon. She said yesterday that she feared for her life when she plunged into the swollen river with her daughter Emma. Mrs Dodd was forced to stand in waist-high freezing water for 15 minutes before they were rescued. \"I was more worried about the baby than myself,\" she said. \"I fell face-down in the water and went under, but because Emma was on my back, I don't think she did. It was very frightening.\" Much of the land around Shrewsbury, Tewkesbury, Worcester, Hereford and Ross-on-Wye is saturated with water. Eighteen homes along the river Thames were flooded in the Oxford, Shiplake, Wargrave and Henley areas. The Thames Barrier was closed twice yesterday in an ticipation of high tides. Richard Symonds, of the Environment Agency, said that 75 homes were under threat from flooding on the Somerset Levels. At the village of Northmoor flood levels are currently 4.6 metres and rising. Mr Symonds said that up to 40mm of rain was forecast for the rest of the week. \"This is a very serious situation,\" he said. \"Everyone concerned must be ready to move out as soon as they are requested to by the police.\" The Meteorological Office said that the strongest winds would be in the counties surrounding the Bristol Channel and the English Channel.

Not in effective action, but in headline grabbing announcements, in an attempt to salvage your long-gone reputation of being tough on crime.\"</p> <p>Mr Straw said that the five anti-crime bills unveiled in the Queen's speech would help to cut crime. The populist bills include fixed penalties for disorderly behaviour in public places and extended child curfew schemes. He added: \"Crime is still high, but thanks to the measures we have introduced crime is now under control.\"</p>",

The government's decision to delay the introduction of the prostitutes' card law will prompt Tory criticisms that ministerial spin is not matched by action. Jack Straw first made clear his determination to crack down on the cards in 1998 when the Home Office announced that prostitutes who place cards in public telephone boxes would be guilty of a criminal offence. About 13m cards advertising male and female sexual services are removed from 1,000 BT telephone boxes in central London every year. A further 1mcards are removed from 240 telephone boxes in Brighton and Hove. Other areas, where cards are posted, include Norwich, Felixstowe, Bath and Birmingham. The announcement on prostitutes' cards came as Mr Straw defended himself against Tory claims that he has failed victims of crime. In a Commons debate on the crime bills introduced in the Queen's speech, the shadow home secretary, Ann Widdecombe, dubbed the government's legislative programme a \"missed opportunity\" that would fail to reverse rising crime or increase police officer numbers. Facing the home secretary, she asked: \"Doesn't this just show where your priorities lie? Not in effective action, but in headline grabbing announcements, in an attempt to salvage your long-gone reputation of being tough on crime.\" Mr Straw said that the five anti-crime bills unveiled in the Queen's speech would help to cut crime. The populist bills include fixed penalties for disorderly behaviour in public places and extended child curfew schemes. He added: \"Crime is still high, but thanks to the measures we have introduced crime is now under control.\"",

Still, why bother agitating, never mind educating, in Nailsworth at this time of year when the weather is so much nicer on the Cote d'Azur? Andrew Furlong Leicester",

      "body": "<p>Amid all the political posturing and the volley of statistics surrounding the issue of illegal immigration into the United Kingdom, it is an image which suddenly humanises the cross-Channel trade in stowaways. The Iraqi baby seems dazed, oblivious to the flashbulbs popping around her; her outsized pink bobble-hat strikes an incongruous note on the rain-sodden Calais docks. She has spent the previous few hours hidden in the back of a lorry bound for Dover, and much of the past month in similar conditions on the arduous trek from Turkey across Europe. But for now her family's covert journey to England is on hold, interrupted by security guards hired to search every truck making the crossing for signs of stowaways, smuggled on board for \u00a3400 a time.</p> <p>This much is common knowledge; P&amp;O Stena's newly toughened stance against illegal immigration has been a public relations coup for the ferry operator. What happens next is not.</p> <p>If she is lucky, the baby girl will be bundled into a taxi by waiting police. Otherwise, her family will have a 12-kilometre walk along windswept motorways to their temporary home, the Red Cross reception centre near the coastal suburb of Sangatte - a huge, mud-green factory shed on a hill overlooking the Channel. Providing basic shelter and food to a constantly changing population of mainly Iraqis, Kurds, Palestinians, North Africans and Kosovars, it is a place without equal in western Europe: a refugee camp that feels like the edge of the world, but is actually a matter of minutes by car from the hypermarkets flogging cut-price beer and wine to booze-cruising Brits.</p> <p>No questions are asked of the clandestines who pass in straggling groups through the camp gates. The authorities prefer it that way. Without any system of registration, the asylum-seekers are free to launch multiple attempts at the illegal crossing without explicit French backing.</p> <p>\"The doors are open, but it is a kind of prison,\" says Maher, a 32-year-old Palestinian computer programmer idling near the town hall, where somebody has scrawled graffiti labelling the local population xenophobes and Nazis. A journey he had planned for years and which has taken him two months so far is an hour's ferry ride from completion. \"People are losing their minds in there,\" he says, gesturing towards the camp.</p> <p>Sangatte's open-door policy is not extended to journalists, who are stopped at the gate. Stung by local criticisms that the centre is wasting millions of francs on \"bogus\" asylum-seekers, the Red Cross, a spokesman says, has made it \"a basic principle\" not to admit the press. But Maher reckons I could pass as Albanian, and sure enough, it proves easy to slip past the Red Cross marshals in the guise of an asylum-seeker.</p> <p>The first thing that hits you is the stench from the toilet sheds wafting into the air which, at 5pm, is already seriously cold. Nearby, immigrants with children live in 20 Portakabins, around 25 people to each; they are divided into individual rooms of about three square metres by scraps of fabric hung from the wall. Maher and I are not so lucky. Our accommodation is in the military-style tents towards the back of the warehouse, where young men sleep 14 to a tent on narrow plastic hammocks. There are about 700 people in residence at the moment, but with fewer ferry crossings over Christmas, the Red Cross fears their numbers will rise steeply.</p> <p>Most, with the exception of the Kurds, are articulate English speakers, often with university degrees and a scattering of PhDs. Many are frighteningly well read. Maher's conversation is peppered with references to Heidegger and Foucault, while Latif, a young Afghan who says he is fleeing the Taliban in fear of violent reprisals for his political views, frames his argument in terms of phenomenological philosophy. It is hard to avoid the feeling that their intellectual backgrounds make the indignities of daily life at Sangatte all the greater.</p> <p>\"We are very grateful to the French, but some of them, even the Red Cross, they treat us like animals,\" says Jouan, a mild-mannered lecturer who has travelled from Syria in the backs of trucks with one change of clothes, a guitar and a dog-eared Arabic copy of Nietzsche's Beyond Good and Evil. He was imprisoned, he says, because he had links with Amnesty International. His brother and sister are still serving 12-year sentences for membership of the Communist party. But his wealthy father bought him a 24-hour visit home and he took a midnight lift to the border. \"The way they look at us, they treat us like we are nothing,\" he says of the camp staff. \"I suppose we are nothing. But we were something.\"</p> <p>Like Jouan, many in the centre are escaping political imprisonment or violence, but others freely admit to motives usually considered suspect in the UK and France alike: the fulfilment of entrepreneurial or academic ambitions cut short, they say, by the UN embargo on Iraq, or the Israeli government, or the Taliban. There are plenty of economic migrants among the political ones, but listening to them, it soon becomes hard to see a dividing line between the two.</p> <p>Dinner, served on long tables lined with benches, consists of some dubious chunks of pinkish meat - \"crazy cow,\" Latif guesses - and rice with peas. But we're among the last to eat, and as we try to leave we are pushed back by Red Cross staff, shouting \"Hey mistair!\", and thrusting cloths and buckets of water at us, refusing to open the metal gates of the eating area until we've sponged down the tables and benches.</p> <p>It is a perfectly reasonable request, of course, but something about the way it is made goes to the heart of the camp residents' troubled relationship with the Red Cross. Stories abound of staff displaying what the asylum seekers interpret as contempt, locking them out of the showers, denying them hot water to wash clothes, waking them loudly at night while carrying out routine patrols. \"Washing all our family's clothes in one tiny bucket of cold water, it's no way to live,\" says one woman. It is an attitude that it would be easy to interpret as ingratitude if one was so inclined.</p> <p>\"They're doing what they can, I suppose, but they could knock this place down, and we would still find a way,\" says Maher, disappearing to begin the nightly process of \"borrowing\" extra blankets from neighbouring tents. Opinions towards the French police are much harder: two Middle Eastern asylum seekers show numerous scars on their shoulders and arms they insist come not from mistreatment in their homelands but from the truncheons of port police.</p> <p>Time stretches and yawns at the camp; with only a single television and a couple of old five-a-side football goals, most people seem to while away the hours smoking and pacing the warehouse floor. Ali, a portly 40-year-old Iraqi who had an English girlfriend before diplomatic relations soured, spends most of his time standing at the door of the building, positioned by cruel chance to provide a constant frieze of ferries plying the Channel. \"On a clear night people say you can see the lights on the other side,\" he says, but he's not sure he believes them: during the two winter weeks he has spent making nightly attempts at passage to England, he can't remember any clear nights.</p> <p>The halogen lamps flooding the warehouse are shut off and we return to our tents. Around 3am, a gnawing cold sets in. Every noise is magnified by the echoing concrete, but soon the rain starts to hammer deafeningly on the corrugated iron roof, dripping through onto our tents. \"Listen,\" shouts Ali, as if it were possible to do anything else. \"There's a war outside.\" At some point in the night we are joined by four Ethiopians, pulled off lorries at the docks hours before. Exhausted, they sleep through the cacophany, but for everyone else, sleep is fitful, punctuated by hacking coughs and children crying.</p> <p>The England that dominates their thoughts is a strange place - \"a completely inaccurate vision of Eldorado\" is how the camp's deputy director, Michel Meriaux, puts it. For all of them, it is the ne plus ultra of democracy and human rights, a place where work permits are easy to come by - certainly far easier than in mainland Europe - and accommodation not so hard to find; for some, it is a stepping-stone to the US and Canada.</p> <p>For Ali, who studied at Teesside Polytechnic in the 1970s, it is: \"cheese and onion crisps . . . a pint of beer for about a pound, I think\"; summer weekends in Neath; a kebab shop on the Old Brompton Road. \"England is a place where they really value the past, hold on to historic things,\" he says.</p> <p>Curiously, it is a vision which recalls nothing so much as John Major's picture of foggy cricket grounds and bicycling spinsters.</p> <p>What it is, is a place where they do expect to have to work: work, after all, is precisely the point of the voyage for most. I ask Jouan, the lecturer and Nietzsche reader, about his professional ambitions. \"A job,\" he says. \"Just any job, really.\" The glowing tip of Maher's roll-up pierces the darkness. \"Baudelaire had something to say about all this,\" he sighs. \"You've read Baudelaire?\"</p> <p>' It's tonight, I think,\" says a man who tells me I can call him Mohammed, though he won't reveal his real name or country of origin. After breakfast - bread and tea or coffee - he outlines his plan: he has made a deal with \"a friend in Calais\" whom he is to meet at the ferry terminal tonight. He reckons I might be getting a taxi back to the city soon, and charmingly informs me that he will be sharing it.</p> <p>Back in Calais, he explains that he wants to cover the final distance to the terminal alone, and catches one of the free transfer buses provided by the ferry operators. By the time I reach the terminal later that evening, he could be any one of the hunched figures scrambling up motorway embankments, hiding under bridges, slipping in and out of the shadows in the lorry parks, hardened against the wind and the hammering rain by the dream of stumbling, a few hours later, into the grey half-light of a Dover dawn.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Carpet warehouse group Carpetright is rolling out a nationwide home shopping service, selling carpets off the back of a lorry, which it expects to be profitable within 12 months. </p> <p>The service, Harris Carpets at Home, began as a pilot project in London three months ago. Potential customers access the service via the web and the company then dispatches a van and sales rep to their home. So far 10 vans are on the road, making five to six calls a day each and taking orders worth a total \u00a370,000 a week. </p> <p>By the end of April the company plans to have 100 vans, each carrying thousands of broadloom carpet samples, operating across the country. </p> <p>Lord Harris, the chairman, said: \"This is going to be very, very profitable.

      "bodyText": "Carpet warehouse group Carpetright is rolling out a nationwide home shopping service, selling carpets off the back of a lorry, which it expects to be profitable within 12 months. The service, Harris Carpets at Home, began as a pilot project in London three months ago. Potential customers access the service via the web and the company then dispatches a van and sales rep to their home. So far 10 vans are on the road, making five to six calls a day each and taking orders worth a total \u00a370,000 a week. By the end of April the company plans to have 100 vans, each carrying thousands of broadloom carpet samples, operating across the country. Lord Harris, the chairman, said: \"This is going to be very, very profitable. We are going to expand this in a big way in the next 12 months.\" The average van order, he said, was \u00a3800, compared to \u00a3150 in store, and orders are coming from professional people and those who for lack of mobility do not use the company's traditional outlets. He estimated the service would build to a \u00a3200m-a-year operation. Rowan Morgan, an analyst at Teather &amp; Greenwood, said the market for home carpet sales could reach \u00a31bn a year, potentially \"bigger than the out-of-town [stores] market\". Lord Harris, who with his family owns 26% of Carpetright, said the service accessed at www.carpetright.com or www harriscarpets.com was already winning repeat business and was successful because \"it is the right place to buy a carpet - at home\".

Carpetright was reporting profits up 17% to \u00a319m in the six months to the end of October.

The trouble started with taunts between rival gangs. It swiftly turned more deadly.</p> <p>The teenage gangs, one from nearby Gaston-Rouleau, the other from the Nord housing estate, began waving knives and guns and the evening degenerated into a mass brawl which spilled onto the streets.</p> <p>One boy, 17-year-old Sami, tried to find refuge on a bus but a gang of 30 followed him and in the ensuing fight he was stabbed twice in the chest.</p> <p>Sami - the French police do not release the family names of juvenile perpetrators or victims of crime - died shortly later. A youth of his own age has admitted the crime.</p> <p>The incident last Friday in Drancy is just one of a series of murders of teenagers by teenagers. Like Britain in the wake of the death of Damilola Taylor, France is agonising over the causes of the killings.</p> <p>The violence is often associated with gang feuds in the tough, high-rise estates that ring French cities. There, unemployment is high and the young people, many from ethnic minorities, often reject authority.</p> <p>After Sami's death, the Communist mayor of Drancy, Gilbert Conte, called for \"national measures to calm the violence which has taken hold of our young people\". So far no special measures have been taken.</p> <p>Explanations for the rise in youth crime abound - ranging from an absence of parental control and the influence of drugs to the alienation of young Muslims from mainstream French society - but no single factor appears to account for the recent spate of killings.</p> <p>On November 8, Romuald, 14, became the innocent victim of rivalry between two gangs. He and a friend were walking just yards from his mother's flat in Courcouronnes, south of Paris, when a driver in a parked car called out to him.

      "bodyText": "It was supposed to be a fundraising evening for genetic research and the Auguste-Delaune gym in Drancy, north of Paris, was packed with young people watching displays of dance, rap music and martial arts. The trouble started with taunts between rival gangs. It swiftly turned more deadly. The teenage gangs, one from nearby Gaston-Rouleau, the other from the Nord housing estate, began waving knives and guns and the evening degenerated into a mass brawl which spilled onto the streets. One boy, 17-year-old Sami, tried to find refuge on a bus but a gang of 30 followed him and in the ensuing fight he was stabbed twice in the chest. Sami - the French police do not release the family names of juvenile perpetrators or victims of crime - died shortly later. A youth of his own age has admitted the crime. The incident last Friday in Drancy is just one of a series of murders of teenagers by teenagers. Like Britain in the wake of the death of Damilola Taylor, France is agonising over the causes of the killings. The violence is often associated with gang feuds in the tough, high-rise estates that ring French cities. There, unemployment is high and the young people, many from ethnic minorities, often reject authority. After Sami's death, the Communist mayor of Drancy, Gilbert Conte, called for \"national measures to calm the violence which has taken hold of our young people\". So far no special measures have been taken. Explanations for the rise in youth crime abound - ranging from an absence of parental control and the influence of drugs to the alienation of young Muslims from mainstream French society - but no single factor appears to account for the recent spate of killings. On November 8, Romuald, 14, became the innocent victim of rivalry between two gangs. He and a friend were walking just yards from his mother's flat in Courcouronnes, south of Paris, when a driver in a parked car called out to him. He walked over, and was killed by two shotgun blasts. On November 26, Salim, 17, was shot dead on the Cedres estate in Marseille. A youth the same age told police he shot at Salim's head \"to scare him\". On December 2, Soufiane, 15, was found with his throat slashed in a cellar in La Villeneuve, near Grenoble. Police believed that the boy had been playing truant and initially his parents' fears for his life were not taken seriously. Soufiane's body was found three days after he went missing - in the interim, a school was burned down by young people protesting at the police's failure to find him. Police have since arrested two 17-year-old boys for the crime, and claim that an unpaid drug bill was their motive for the killing. \"The motive for this gang warfare? The young people involved forgot what that was a long time ago,\" said Sebastien Ramhoux of Le Parisien newspaper. \"All this rivalry is just a pretext for stabbings or shootings; in the bus, in schools, in the street.\" Between 1993 and 1999, the number of 13-18 year-olds in jail in France almost doubled to 4,326. The number jailed for violent crime almost tripled between 1994 and 1998 to 3,825. But it is the rate of murders of adolescents, which for the past 20 years has ranged between 20 and 40 per year in France, that has proved most disquieting. \"I've been in this job for 25 years but this phenomenon of young boys from housing estates killing each other is the most disturbing thing I've witnessed,\" Rene Guillemet, a director of the juvenile offenders' agency, Le Protection Judiciaire de la Jeunesse, said. \"Among delinquent minors we take in charge, we keep noting that their behaviour is increasingly violent, not just among themselves, but to their teachers too.\" One of France's most popular films at the moment is La Squale (a squale is a girl tearaway), directed by Fabrice Genestal, a former teacher at a school in Sarcelles, near Paris.

      "body": "<p>Comparisons are odious, but they were hard to avoid while watching <strong> The Players Club</strong> (BBC2), a no-warts-at-all profile of Melanie Brown. Only a couple of nights ago, Channel 4 devoted several hours to Madonna, and still seemed only to have skimmed the surface; The Players Club took 50 minutes to plumb Mel B's depths, and there was still time left over for some video clips to promote the album. Mel B is a simple soul who inhabits her Scary Spice persona as long as there's a camera within focal range, and who wastes very little time pondering her art. By her own admission, she doesn't read the papers. \"As long as they print a nice picture of me, I don't give a fuck\", she said, which seems as good a coping strategy as any. </p> <p>Bulletins from Spiceworld have become a staple of British TV in the last year or so, and from last night's evidence it seems that Mel B is the current Sad Spice. Mel C may have grabbed headlines with tales of depression and anorexia, but Mel B is going through the mill in her own hysterical way. Take away the laughter - this woman laughs a lot - and we were left with a single mother rattling around in an empty house, surrounded by reminders of a failed marriage, with neighbours sending hate mail of the \"Go back to Brixton\" variety. Mel's parents were quick to point out that they never liked her ex-husband Jimmy Gulzar, nor did any of the other Spice Girls. </p> <p>An average day consisted of relentless promotional work, permanent cameras, a trip to the divorce lawyer and the usual duties of parenthood. Mel's daughter, Phoenix Chi, was the only one who wasn't queueing up to criticise her mother's personal conduct, but that could be because she can barely talk. </p> <p>Everyone else, however, couldn't wait to get the boot in. An unidentified young woman, so consumed with jealousy that she looked as if she'd been chewing a wasp, offered authoritative opinions on the singer's sex life, vocal talents and breast enhancement. \"I can sing better than her\", she claimed, the permanent cry of the under-achiever. The landlady of the local pub in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, spoke with icy politeness of her new neighbour. Even the Brown family joined in this chorus of disapproval, dragging out the wedding albums to point out Jimmy Gulzar's freeloading gay friends. </p> <p>Mel B, to her credit, rose above it all. Her strategy is to be as earthy as possible, assuming (quite rightly) that it's hard to dislike a woman who has two toilets in her bathroom \"so I can have a widdle and a poo with my mates\". She expressed no regrets about marrying Gulzar, and countered boob-job rumours with a general invitation to \"have a feel\". She saved the best line of all to reply to a question about her living quarters. Don't you get lonely in this huge house, asked presenter Trevor Nelson? \"No,\" said Mel B. \"It's huge, but it's homely.\" </p> <p>So, when the cameras are no longer running, does Scary Spice cry herself to sleep? Almost certainly not. Hers is not the fairytale existence of bandmate Victoria Beckham, but things could be a lot worse. She has a beautiful daughter, vast amounts of money and Max Beesley on tap. With those advantages, we could all cope with a bit of public vilification. </p> <p> <strong> Brookside</strong> (Channel 4) continues in macabre mode. Mad Max was getting on with life while his dead wife decayed in the living room. \"Remove from box and place in boiling water\", he said - referring, happily, to a boil-in-the-bag meal and not to a DIY embalming process. \"Silly Daddy keeps losing everything\", he told the children - yes, Daddy, including your marbles, they might have replied as they raced off to nursery. Elsewhere in the Close, late-flowering lesbian Jackie was indulging in a fantastically symbolical bit of decorating to assuage her guilt over sleeping with her own daughter's girlfriend. Could she paper over the cracks? All might have been well but for Bev, a Merseyside Nemesis in a burgundy leather jacket, determined to find out who had been doing what to whom. With a woman's intuition, and a mind so open that she could believe even a Brookside storyline, she jumped to the right conclusion. \"Oh my God,\" she said to Shelley, \"you have done it with Jackie Corkhill and Lindsey Corkhill. You dirty mare.\" Just, if not poetic.</p>",

Maybe Angie's taken up with some alligator-wrestling brute from the boondocks, or maybe Sharon can't face life without Clinton as president. </p> <p>Pundits usually greet soap comebacks with a chorus of groans. It's assumed that the writers must be floundering. Either that, or the actors have grown weary of an anonymity broken only by provincial pantomimes. In reality, this theorising says more about the psychology of viewers than it does about the people who make soap operas. Soap writers use the ugly, but thoroughly apt term \"investment\" to describe the process whereby an audience comes to believe in a character, simply by following them over a number of years. Like parents who have shelled out for a costly education, we become mighty annoyed when our little investments turn round and say they want to become pop stars. When a popular soap actor or actress decides to quit the show, it is tantamount to a betrayal of our faith in them. We have been cheated of our investment. In revenge, we make unkind judgements about the traitor: they have become too greedy, we decide, too big for their boots. Any attempt to make it as a singer or a serious actor, we prophesy smugly, will end in tears. </p> <p>Plenty of departing stars do retreat into obscurity. But recently, there have been notable exceptions. Like it or not, Ross Kemp made a credible defence barrister in ITV's In Defence. And the news that he's going to play upper-crust English swimming champ Captain Webb proves he's not afraid of a challenge. Meanwhile, Michelle Collins was on our screens only last weekend, and if Martine McCutcheon is not pulling Madonna-sized audiences, she is far from being obscure. Key roles in soap opera tend to go to versatile performers, people who can carry on earning a living once they've wiped the Walford grime off their faces. </p> <p>Letitia Dean, who played Sharon for ten years, has not been in the news so much. Her stint as Chris Cross, feisty phone operator, in BBC1's retro piece Hello Girls might not have reaped any Baftas, but it proved a willingness to tackle new ground - even if Sunday night feel-good is not the most demanding genre. And unlike Collins, McCutcheon and Kemp, whose characters joined the EastEnders cast as adults, she faced the additional handicap of having played Sharon from a young age. More screen time, more investment, more viewer resistance to seeing her in new roles. </p> <p>It should also not be forgotten what an engaging character Sharon was. The pantomime season is currently upon us, so it is small wonder that EastEnders and Coronation Street have both brought back their own moustache-twirling villains (Nick Cotton and Terry Duckworth, respectively) to whip us into a booing, hissing frenzy. But Sharon was far more complex, and her return to Walford deserves a more balanced reading. </p> <p>She grew up loving two parents who hated one another. At an early age, she understood the power of sex - even making a memorably terrifying assault on bespectacled barman Lofty. After quitting school at 16 and shacking up with the apparently sexy Simon Wicks, she rapidly developed into a character who invites comparison with the Street's Elsie Tanner - simultaneously vamp and victim. After the body of her murdered father was dredged from the canal, Sharon fled to the arms of Grant Mitchell, who beat her up and nearly succeeded in burning her to death. Not deterred, she conducted an illicit affair with his brother Phil, and the episode where Grant revealed this to the Square - so-called \"Sharongate\" - chalked up record ratings. She survived the sort of shunning normally suffered by 13th-century Welsh witches in order to wreak the perfect revenge on Grant, tricking him into publicly proposing to her, just so she could turn him down. </p> <p>Rarely has a character's exit been so satisfying to watch, and it was a homage to Sharon's strengths as a character that she left with so much unfinished business behind her. Business which will hopefully turn into gripping storylines when she comes back. Peggy Butcher hates her, and owns the pub that Sharon may view as her rightful inheritance. Phil hates her, but will doubtless find her a bewitching alternative to current squeeze Lisa. Those loyal to Phil's ex-wife Kathy, such as Ian and Pat, are equally likely to spit on the floor as Sharon enters the bar, but perhaps their own recent sufferings will teach them charity. </p> <p>So if returning to old ground invites criticism, EastEnders should be commended for daring to face it. In the wake of storyline hits such as Ian's bankruptcy and Sonia's baby, the show is hardly in the doldrums. And with a vintage original such as Sharon as its latest weapon in the ratings war, it's hard to see what can go wrong.</p>",

Business which will hopefully turn into gripping storylines when she comes back. Peggy Butcher hates her, and owns the pub that Sharon may view as her rightful inheritance. Phil hates her, but will doubtless find her a bewitching alternative to current squeeze Lisa. Those loyal to Phil's ex-wife Kathy, such as Ian and Pat, are equally likely to spit on the floor as Sharon enters the bar, but perhaps their own recent sufferings will teach them charity. So if returning to old ground invites criticism, EastEnders should be commended for daring to face it. In the wake of storyline hits such as Ian's bankruptcy and Sonia's baby, the show is hardly in the doldrums. And with a vintage original such as Sharon as its latest weapon in the ratings war, it's hard to see what can go wrong.",

If the titles are unfamiliar, it is because they have been revised to fit the new codes of critical correctness now in force following the review of my new Royal Court play, I Just Stopped By To See the Man, by this paper's theatre critic, Michael Billington. There are three characters in the play and two of them - a blues singer and his politically radical daughter - are black Americans. It is this that has vexed Billington and led him to committing two critical faux pas. </p> <p>First he uses the fact that he knows me to be a white British writer to belittle the play as a piece of \"artful impersonation\". The colour of my skin and my passport are enough to invalidate the writing. However, when we auditioned for the part of Jesse in New York, each of the 17 actors we saw asked the casting director about my colour and nationality - they could not distinguish either from the text. But Billington implies that writers who dare to portray anything but immediate autobiographical experience will be flagged offside. </p> <p>Second, Billington suggests that a black writer would have brought some \"hectic, bluesy, volatile veracity\" to the proceedings. Leaving aside the possibility that a black writer might have come up with a cooler, more scholarly work, would a black American writer have been successful in portraying the third character - a white rock singer from Surrey? Or suppose a black British writer had tackled the subject: would Winsome Pinnock have had difficulty in writing two male parts? Would Roy Williams have been unable to write Billington's imaginary play through being too young to remember the 1960s blues revival? Of course not, but Billington would rule them out. </p> <p>One of the basic requirements for being a playwright is to be able to inhabit other people's skins. But why, when no one has ever questioned my right to create roles for women, old people and gays, am I supposed to baulk at the barrier of race? Billington applauded me for writing the role of the Earl of Rochester in The Libertine, but I have no direct experience of being an aristocrat, an alcoholic, or a citizen of 17th-century London. Rochester is more remote from me than the old blues singer Jesse but, because I share his race and nationality, the issue of authenticity is never raised. In fact, the process of writing these two roles is similar: every dramatist has to believe that people have more in common with each other than they have differences. By mixing parallel personal experience, research and instinct, figures from remote times and cultures can be conjured into life. Playwrights have always worked in this way and they always will. </p> <p>Conferences on the future of black theatre always conclude, among other things, that there is a responsibility for playwrights to write black roles. As a white writer writing parts to be played by black actors, I am following an honourable tradition at the Royal Court, treading in the footsteps of Rebecca Pritchard's Yard Gal and Che Walker's Been Here So Long. Indeed, Che Walker informs me that he asked one of the black actors in his play if he felt it was OK for him, a white writer, to write for black people. The reply was simple: \"If you don't, I don't work.\" None of the many black people who have seen, read, or worked on my play have questioned my right or ability to portray black characters on stage. Why is it a problem for critics? </p> <p>A lesser critic than Billington would not be worth arguing with: but he, more than any other observer of drama, has argued for a theatre with a social and political agenda, for big plays on public themes.

      "body": "<p><strong> Saturday </strong><br> </p> <p> Hard to believe that the National Theatre of Brent will be presenting my award-winning yuletide oeuvre The Messiah at the stylish and fashionable Bush Theatre in Shepherd's Bush this Christmas. Must get down to rehearsing. We open in less than a fortnight. Spend the morning working out my guest list for the first night. It will include numerous world-famous celebrities from all walks of life. </p> <p><strong> Sunday </strong><br> </p> <p> Wake early after an extraordinary dream in which I find myself in Bethlehem with Trevor Nunn discussing my first night guest list. Then relax on my theatrical divan and read Sunday papers and various theatrical journals in my attractive and stylish Dollis Hill offices. As I do so, I recall all the numerous other first nights I done and find myself marvelling at the long and glamorous career I have had in the theatre. </p> <p>My reminiscences are rudely broken by a call from my permanent acting company - Raymond Box - complaining that he's trying to learn his lines but can't read my hand- writing. Of course he can't. Famous playwrights write illegibly. This is because their writings burst from the seething hotbed of their own internal organs. Look at Shakespeare, to name but one, I tell him. His writing was totally indecipherable. Not to mention Chekhov, who not only wrote back to front but also in Russian! </p> <p><strong> Monday </strong><br> </p> <p> Call from the Guardian arts desk, begging me to write a production diary of my award-winning oeuvre The Messiah, opening at the stylish and fashionable Bush Theatre in Shepherd's Bush in less than a fortnight. I am told it should be in the same vein as the Secret Diary of Sir Peter Hall. I tell him I would be honoured as Sir Peter's diaries are in my humble view probably one of the most inspirational diaries ever done and he lies constantly by my bedside. </p> <p>An urgent call from Raymond in a state of panic claiming I never told him he was playing the Virgin Mary. I told him he was playing Mary at least a week ago! We had the same brouhaha last year when I cast him as Princess Diana in our award- winning oeuvre Love Upon the Throne. He aks why he has to play all the lady characters all the time. Eventually I mollify him by offering him the key role of Balthazar, the chief wise man, and agree that he can find himself an inexpensive headdress to wear in act one. An aspect that will appeal to a simple mind such as Raymond's. Sometimes one is forced to resort to such draconian ruses! Work into the early hours honing my first night guest list. I have now whittled it down to 750 people and it will include numerous media, showbiz, political, sports and church personalities. </p> <p><strong> Tuesday</strong><br> </p> <p> Wake after a vivid and some would say prophetic dream in which I am in bed with Trevor Nunn and Sir Peter Hall in the middle of Shepherd's Bush Green in ornamental bejewelled turbans. Breakfast on All-Bran. Relax with periodicals. Reminisce about my fascinating childhood. Raymond arrives and presents me with receipts for two books - Having Babies the Natural Way and the Teach Yourself Home Midwifery. I tell him in no uncertain terms that for as long as I've been in the theatre, actors always pay for their own research, thank you very much! In the evening I treat him to a fascinating slide show of \"stills\" from many of my previous successes. Then he insists on watching Who Wants To Be a Millionaire. How can people watch this rubbish? All it does is give not very bright people an inflated idea of their own intelligence. The fact that Raymond managed to reach \u00a3500,000 is a perfect case in point. </p> <p><strong> Wednesday </strong><br> </p> <p> We open The Messiah in a week at the popular and stylish Bush Theatre in London's fashionable Shepherd's Bush Green. Can hardly believe it! Just remembered we need an opera singer to sing highlights from The Messiah by Johann Sebastian Handel while Raymond and I re-enact the Christmas story. Arrange to meet a certain Mrs Flowers, who is the only person to have answered our advert in the Dollis Hill Advertiser. We lunch at the Dome in Shepherd's Bush Road over a bowl of French onion soup (not the same bowl, obviously) and I ask her a number of searing biblical and operatic questions. She tells me her life story then starts singing about sheep. I offer her the job to shut her up. </p> <p><strong> Thursday </strong><br> </p> <p> Arrive at the Bush for first run-through. Shocked to discover Raymond, whose job it is to build and transport the set, stuck halfway up the stairs with two Greek temple pillars and a box of stuffed sheep. This lack of foresight is typical! </p> <p>Regretfully have to decline to give help as I never think it's good for one's actors to see an artistic director lugging sets and props about. Would you ever see Trevor Nunn lugging sets about at the National Theatre? Or Adrian Mole at the Royal Shakespeare Company? I think not, Raymond! </p> <p>Spend the rest of the afternoon on the couch in my dressing room adding more names to my first night guest list and marvelling at the extraordinary number of my own glittering first nights I have attended. Shocked to discover that the Bush seats only 101 people! The Bush press office is in a state because I have invited over 1,600 people on the first night. This was followed by - I have to say - an appalling dress rehearsal. I myself have never been better as Joseph, first shepherd and God, but Raymond's performance as Balthazar the chief wise man is frankly appalling. Not only that, but he has found himself an exquisitely bejewelled and rare ornamental headdress that totally unbalances his characterisation in my view. I fear I will be forced to recast Balthazar and wear the headdress myself. </p> <p>Also - and more worrying - Mrs Flowers fainted during the birth scene.

      "bodyText": "Saturday Hard to believe that the National Theatre of Brent will be presenting my award-winning yuletide oeuvre The Messiah at the stylish and fashionable Bush Theatre in Shepherd's Bush this Christmas. Must get down to rehearsing. We open in less than a fortnight. Spend the morning working out my guest list for the first night. It will include numerous world-famous celebrities from all walks of life. Sunday Wake early after an extraordinary dream in which I find myself in Bethlehem with Trevor Nunn discussing my first night guest list. Then relax on my theatrical divan and read Sunday papers and various theatrical journals in my attractive and stylish Dollis Hill offices. As I do so, I recall all the numerous other first nights I done and find myself marvelling at the long and glamorous career I have had in the theatre. My reminiscences are rudely broken by a call from my permanent acting company - Raymond Box - complaining that he's trying to learn his lines but can't read my hand- writing. Of course he can't. Famous playwrights write illegibly. This is because their writings burst from the seething hotbed of their own internal organs. Look at Shakespeare, to name but one, I tell him. His writing was totally indecipherable. Not to mention Chekhov, who not only wrote back to front but also in Russian! Monday Call from the Guardian arts desk, begging me to write a production diary of my award-winning oeuvre The Messiah, opening at the stylish and fashionable Bush Theatre in Shepherd's Bush in less than a fortnight. I am told it should be in the same vein as the Secret Diary of Sir Peter Hall. I tell him I would be honoured as Sir Peter's diaries are in my humble view probably one of the most inspirational diaries ever done and he lies constantly by my bedside. An urgent call from Raymond in a state of panic claiming I never told him he was playing the Virgin Mary. I told him he was playing Mary at least a week ago! We had the same brouhaha last year when I cast him as Princess Diana in our award- winning oeuvre Love Upon the Throne. He aks why he has to play all the lady characters all the time. Eventually I mollify him by offering him the key role of Balthazar, the chief wise man, and agree that he can find himself an inexpensive headdress to wear in act one. An aspect that will appeal to a simple mind such as Raymond's. Sometimes one is forced to resort to such draconian ruses! Work into the early hours honing my first night guest list. I have now whittled it down to 750 people and it will include numerous media, showbiz, political, sports and church personalities. Tuesday Wake after a vivid and some would say prophetic dream in which I am in bed with Trevor Nunn and Sir Peter Hall in the middle of Shepherd's Bush Green in ornamental bejewelled turbans. Breakfast on All-Bran. Relax with periodicals. Reminisce about my fascinating childhood. Raymond arrives and presents me with receipts for two books - Having Babies the Natural Way and the Teach Yourself Home Midwifery. I tell him in no uncertain terms that for as long as I've been in the theatre, actors always pay for their own research, thank you very much! In the evening I treat him to a fascinating slide show of \"stills\" from many of my previous successes. Then he insists on watching Who Wants To Be a Millionaire. How can people watch this rubbish? All it does is give not very bright people an inflated idea of their own intelligence. The fact that Raymond managed to reach \u00a3500,000 is a perfect case in point. Wednesday We open The Messiah in a week at the popular and stylish Bush Theatre in London's fashionable Shepherd's Bush Green. Can hardly believe it! Just remembered we need an opera singer to sing highlights from The Messiah by Johann Sebastian Handel while Raymond and I re-enact the Christmas story. Arrange to meet a certain Mrs Flowers, who is the only person to have answered our advert in the Dollis Hill Advertiser. We lunch at the Dome in Shepherd's Bush Road over a bowl of French onion soup (not the same bowl, obviously) and I ask her a number of searing biblical and operatic questions. She tells me her life story then starts singing about sheep. I offer her the job to shut her up. Thursday Arrive at the Bush for first run-through. Shocked to discover Raymond, whose job it is to build and transport the set, stuck halfway up the stairs with two Greek temple pillars and a box of stuffed sheep. This lack of foresight is typical! Regretfully have to decline to give help as I never think it's good for one's actors to see an artistic director lugging sets and props about. Would you ever see Trevor Nunn lugging sets about at the National Theatre? Or Adrian Mole at the Royal Shakespeare Company? I think not, Raymond! Spend the rest of the afternoon on the couch in my dressing room adding more names to my first night guest list and marvelling at the extraordinary number of my own glittering first nights I have attended. Shocked to discover that the Bush seats only 101 people! The Bush press office is in a state because I have invited over 1,600 people on the first night. This was followed by - I have to say - an appalling dress rehearsal. I myself have never been better as Joseph, first shepherd and God, but Raymond's performance as Balthazar the chief wise man is frankly appalling. Not only that, but he has found himself an exquisitely bejewelled and rare ornamental headdress that totally unbalances his characterisation in my view. I fear I will be forced to recast Balthazar and wear the headdress myself. Also - and more worrying - Mrs Flowers fainted during the birth scene. Raymond's depiction of all stages of labour and delivery are graphic, to say the least. I asked him to tone it down a bit but he just looked at me with a strange wild stare and muttered something about having the baby his way and no one was going to stop him! I told him in no uncertain terms that I have invited the Archbishop of Canterbury to the first night and we simply cannot have a trained opera singer keeling over during possibly the most pivotal moment in the entire Christian doctrine. Friday Hard to believe that the National Theatre of Brent will be presenting my award-winning yuletide oeuvre The Messiah at the stylish and fashionable Bush Theatre in Shepherd's Bush in just a few days' time. My exhilaration is somewhat blighted by a very unfortunate argument with Mrs Flowers about the size of her and Raymond's dressing room. Try to explain that, as artistic director, I have to have the larger (actually the only) room with en-suite facilities and the panoramic vista over Shepherd's Bush Green. If I don't, I'll have to go in the cleaning cupboard with Raymond, which is clearly untenable. Also, I need a larger room for all my important political showbiz friends who I will be entertaining on a nightly basis, including Chris Smith, the Spice Girls, Charlotte Church and Sophia Loren. Then I have Raymond whingeing on about the fact that Mrs Flowers has used his hairpiece to clean the toilet. I'm afraid to say I have no sympathy. Raymond's toupee has caused more problems than it's worth. It finished up in an old folks' home in Galashiels last year during the Edinburgh festival, but that's another story. The Bush is still in a state about my guest list, which has now reached over 2,000 people. As artistic director of one of the most prestigious national theatres in the land, surely I have a right to ask who I want! Finally, during a searing interview with the Hounslow Chronicle, I drift off in sheer exhaustion.

Definitely.\" I sighed. \"That means no jeans and no trainers,\" she concluded pointedly. I sighed again. No jeans, no trainers. She made it sound as though I was going to a nightclub that also displayed signs such as \"Over 25s only\" and \"No football colours\". (In a way, I was. When I eventually arrived, there were indeed no trainers, jeans or football colours. And there were only a couple of people under 25, whom the rest of the more mature audience eyed with curiosity.) </p> <p>So, suit, dinner jacket or smart trousers? Still unsure, I called Drew, Scottish Opera's press officer. He said black tie was really only a first night thing, and that donning a suit would rank me among the best dressed opera-goers. Something smart, he implied, but not too smart - unless you want people to know you're an opera virgin. But no jeans, no trainers. Given that I normally do my TV reviews in pants and a T-shirt - or, on a cold day, pyjamas - any outfit would be \"dressed up\" for me. I finally opted for a pair of smartish trousers and a short-sleeved, Chinese-red Joseph shirt. Smart but casual, as they say in Glasgow, with a hint of the Orient in homage to Madama Butterfly. </p> <p>I was confident my outfit wouldn't betray me as a pleb whose last trip to the opera started off with him pronouncing Turandot incorrectly (I thought the final \"t\" was silent) and ended with him close to tears because the whole thing was so bloody long. Madama Butterfly was quite straightforward on the pronunciation front - if I remembered not to say Madame - and it was only two hours and 50 minutes long. I say \"only\" but, coming in at the length of two EastEnders omnibuses, that was probably as much as I could endure without a cup of tea. </p> <p>My job dictates I don't really get out much, so to be in a crowded theatre with lots of old people is quite frightening. Surrounded by men in tartan trousers and bifocals and women whose last orgasm coincided with the Suez crisis, it was like being in the waiting room for heaven. I nervously found Drew, who was suited up. \"I thought you were getting dressed up,\" he said. Unsure whether he was joking - in retrospect, I think he was - I replied: \"This is as dressed up as I get. Unless it's a wedding or a funeral.\" </p> <p>He gave me my tickets and bade me enjoy the show. Feeling incongruous, fraudulent and a teensy bit intimidated (\"TV critic is beaten to death by opera lovers for suggesting John Thaw has a wooden leg\"), I climbed the stairs into the auditorium. It was very posh and I was glad I wasn't in my pyjamas. As the safety curtain rose and a hush fell, I was quite excited. And then it started. The set was nice - minimal Japanese rather than the Shogun props room look. Sliding opaque screens were, I imagine, emblematic of the lies told by BF Pinkerton and the layers of truth revealed to Madama Butterfly. Due to the stylish lighting, silhouette was used to great effect and, visually, it was quite stunning, though not as epic as I expected. </p> <p>As Pinkerton was telling the marriage broker of his plans for an American wife, I had great fun guessing what BF stood for, though none of my thoughts are printable in a family newspaper. And it was hard not to shout, \"Don't do it!\" at Butterfly, especially when I realised the poor love was only 15. Did it she did, however, and even when a Phil Mitchell-type uncle shouted the odds, Butterfly said she didn't care for her relatives as long as she had Pinkerton. Oh dear, I thought. This happens in Family Affairs all the time. It is bound to end in disaster. And when she brandished her dad's ceremonial dagger, it was a foregone conclusion that someone would be gutted before the night was out. </p> <p>Of course, that's the frustrating thing about classics such as Madama Butterfly: the conclusion is foregone. We know she dies at the end and there's no chance she might knife the duplicitous Pinkerton. While getting to the end point is an interesting journey, what I really wanted was a different destination. (Woman is shafted by man and pays the ultimate price is not a story I want to hear again, especially after Charlie's Angels.) And I was sick during the interval. Not directly because of the opera but I did have sushi before I went - to get in the mood, you understand. So I missed a bit of the second half and wasn't really concentrating until Butterfly and her son Sorrow started attacking the mean marriage broker, Goro. </p> <p>When the end came, it was a blessed relief. As I was unaccustomed to opera, the form estranged me from the content. Being used to TV drama, which strives to make its style unobtrusive - or at least \"realistic\" - at some points during the opera I wanted them to stop singing and just get on with the action. It wasn't even like a musical, where you can sing along. As accomplished and pleasant as the singing was, it didn't engage me. </p> <p>In short, I did not have a moment like Julia Roberts does in Pretty Woman. The only tears in my eyes were because I was unwell. In the end, all I wanted was my pyjamas and a cup of hot, sweet tea.</p>",

      "body": "<p>As they battle for insurance payouts for all the floods of the past few months, the inhabitants of Uxbridge, Middlesex, might spare a thought for the people of Samoa. On small islands like this, and others including the Maldives and Marshall Islands, there is more than just insurance at stake. In this location global warming could mean islands being so swamped they disappear.</p> <p>As temperatures rise, scientists are forecasting higher sea levels, freak weather, storms, floods and tidal waves. But it is not the biggest industrial nations, the source of most of the pollution, that will be hardest hit. The small, low-lying coastal nations - which, in particular, lack resources to protect fragile ecosystems - face being wiped out.</p> <p>Various green groups are tackling the issue, publicising it, and working at international level and with the communities concerned.</p> <p>But one group has been taking a different approach, aiming, since 1989, to empower the disadvantaged by giving free legal aid. They are a team of environmental lawyers known as Field - the Foundation for International Environmental Law and Development - whose focus is not just climate change but habitat loss, water pollution, and the ozone layer.</p> <p>Farhana Yamin, who directs Field's climate change work, has seen first-hand how developing countries can be overlooked or even bullied as the international heavyweights haggle over environmental reforms. Field's lawyers attended the recent Hague summit to give legal backing to the Alliance of Small Island States (Aosis), 43 islands and low-lying coastal countries which are particularly vulnerable to global warming. The biggest irony, she says, was that the nations most threatened by global warming and climate change were excluded from negotiations over the deals.</p> <p>Ms Yamin believes the Hague summit was characterised by suspicion and brinkmanship. \"Many Hague delegates felt a selected few countries, including Britain and America, were going to cook the books together and once they had agreed everyone else would be forced to rubber stamp it. That's the type of thing we have to worry about. We are there to provide support to Aosis states to ensure their interests are fully represented.\"</p> <p>At the last climate change summit, in Kyoto, five Field lawyers served on Aosis delegations to ensure that the final protocol text, which had legally binding targets, was \"as progressive and environmentally effective as could be negotiated\". One of the many challenges small island developing nations face is how to strengthen their position as the UN proceeds with negotiations on climate change.</p> <p>Small island states have a strong collective voice acting as the Aosis group, says Ms Yamin, but since they are dispersed across the globe they come under pressure not just from the superpowers but from their neighbours, such as Australia and Japan. Developing countries which depend heavily on overseas aid, says Ms Yamin, may find their wealthy benefactors suddenly calling in the favours to secure, for instance, support for contentious issues such as whaling agreements. The small nations often fear that if they do not play ball their aid packages may dry up.</p> <p>J\u00fcrgen Lefevere, staff lawyer at Field, says: \"Australia, for example, has taken a particularly bad position on carbon sinks, a practice where countries plant forests as a way of absorbing harmful carbon dioxide emissions - rather than actually cut emissions.\"</p> <p>Australia, he adds, has \"used all sorts of tactics\" to undermine Aosis countries on the \"sinks\" issue. Up against such international bullying, the small nations have discovered their best tactic is to speak from the heart.</p> <p>Neroni Slade, an ambassador from Samoa who is also chair of Aosis, says: \"Climate change is real. We know this from what is happening to our islands, whether through excessive rainfall or drought, or through the destructive forces of increasingly frequent hurricanes and storms.</p> <p>\"We make no apology for [being] driven by our fears and concerns for the safety and survival of our islands and communities.</p> <p>\"We believe very deeply that there is a question of equity and justice at stake. We are the first and we are the most severely at risk.\"</p> <p>The effects of these weather patterns are dramatic, none more so than in sea-level changes. \"We need to save the coral reefs and resurrect or replant protective natural vegetation like mangroves. It is a massive task but we need to take the first step. Some of this work will need financial support from our industrialised country partners.\"</p> <p>It is frustrating, says Ms Yamin, that messages like that from the Samoan ambassador have not led to more action by the main culprits of environmental pollution to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p> <p>The UN framework convention on climate change obliges industrialised nations to demonstrate that they are \"taking the lead\" in controlling emission. As the first test of commitment, the proposal is for the stabilisation of emissions down to 1990 levels by 2000. But most industrialised countries have seen increases in greenhouse gas emissions.</p> <p>The 21 nations of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development report a rise in carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel combustion of 10.8% over the decade. The US increased its emissions by 12.7%, Canada by 12.4%, Australia by 15.4%, and Japan by 13.6%. All these increases took place when representatives from these nations were negotiating with smaller countries about how to strengthen the commitment to stabilisation.</p> <p>\"At the Hague we had an amazing conference in terms of the influence of the small island states,\" Ms Yamin says. \"They definitely boxed well above their weight by forcing the rich polluting nations to listen to their plight and also by fighting against Opec countries that have a different agenda. Opec don't want oil revenues to go down so they tend to prevent as much progressive change as possible. \"</p> <p>Many small nations found it frustrating that the emission rates of a lot of countries had gone up in the past 10 years. \"But we will be back at the next round of negotiations,\" insists Ms Yamin. \"We will be assisting Aosis members in trying to get the heavyweights to reduce their emissions. For our clients, it could literally mean the difference between life and death.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "As they battle for insurance payouts for all the floods of the past few months, the inhabitants of Uxbridge, Middlesex, might spare a thought for the people of Samoa. On small islands like this, and others including the Maldives and Marshall Islands, there is more than just insurance at stake. In this location global warming could mean islands being so swamped they disappear. As temperatures rise, scientists are forecasting higher sea levels, freak weather, storms, floods and tidal waves. But it is not the biggest industrial nations, the source of most of the pollution, that will be hardest hit. The small, low-lying coastal nations - which, in particular, lack resources to protect fragile ecosystems - face being wiped out. Various green groups are tackling the issue, publicising it, and working at international level and with the communities concerned. But one group has been taking a different approach, aiming, since 1989, to empower the disadvantaged by giving free legal aid. They are a team of environmental lawyers known as Field - the Foundation for International Environmental Law and Development - whose focus is not just climate change but habitat loss, water pollution, and the ozone layer. Farhana Yamin, who directs Field's climate change work, has seen first-hand how developing countries can be overlooked or even bullied as the international heavyweights haggle over environmental reforms. Field's lawyers attended the recent Hague summit to give legal backing to the Alliance of Small Island States (Aosis), 43 islands and low-lying coastal countries which are particularly vulnerable to global warming. The biggest irony, she says, was that the nations most threatened by global warming and climate change were excluded from negotiations over the deals. Ms Yamin believes the Hague summit was characterised by suspicion and brinkmanship. \"Many Hague delegates felt a selected few countries, including Britain and America, were going to cook the books together and once they had agreed everyone else would be forced to rubber stamp it. That's the type of thing we have to worry about. We are there to provide support to Aosis states to ensure their interests are fully represented.\" At the last climate change summit, in Kyoto, five Field lawyers served on Aosis delegations to ensure that the final protocol text, which had legally binding targets, was \"as progressive and environmentally effective as could be negotiated\". One of the many challenges small island developing nations face is how to strengthen their position as the UN proceeds with negotiations on climate change. Small island states have a strong collective voice acting as the Aosis group, says Ms Yamin, but since they are dispersed across the globe they come under pressure not just from the superpowers but from their neighbours, such as Australia and Japan. Developing countries which depend heavily on overseas aid, says Ms Yamin, may find their wealthy benefactors suddenly calling in the favours to secure, for instance, support for contentious issues such as whaling agreements. The small nations often fear that if they do not play ball their aid packages may dry up. J\u00fcrgen Lefevere, staff lawyer at Field, says: \"Australia, for example, has taken a particularly bad position on carbon sinks, a practice where countries plant forests as a way of absorbing harmful carbon dioxide emissions - rather than actually cut emissions.\" Australia, he adds, has \"used all sorts of tactics\" to undermine Aosis countries on the \"sinks\" issue. Up against such international bullying, the small nations have discovered their best tactic is to speak from the heart. Neroni Slade, an ambassador from Samoa who is also chair of Aosis, says: \"Climate change is real. We know this from what is happening to our islands, whether through excessive rainfall or drought, or through the destructive forces of increasingly frequent hurricanes and storms. \"We make no apology for [being] driven by our fears and concerns for the safety and survival of our islands and communities. \"We believe very deeply that there is a question of equity and justice at stake. We are the first and we are the most severely at risk.\" The effects of these weather patterns are dramatic, none more so than in sea-level changes. \"We need to save the coral reefs and resurrect or replant protective natural vegetation like mangroves. It is a massive task but we need to take the first step. Some of this work will need financial support from our industrialised country partners.\" It is frustrating, says Ms Yamin, that messages like that from the Samoan ambassador have not led to more action by the main culprits of environmental pollution to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The UN framework convention on climate change obliges industrialised nations to demonstrate that they are \"taking the lead\" in controlling emission. As the first test of commitment, the proposal is for the stabilisation of emissions down to 1990 levels by 2000. But most industrialised countries have seen increases in greenhouse gas emissions. The 21 nations of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development report a rise in carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel combustion of 10.8% over the decade. The US increased its emissions by 12.7%, Canada by 12.4%, Australia by 15.4%, and Japan by 13.6%. All these increases took place when representatives from these nations were negotiating with smaller countries about how to strengthen the commitment to stabilisation. \"At the Hague we had an amazing conference in terms of the influence of the small island states,\" Ms Yamin says. \"They definitely boxed well above their weight by forcing the rich polluting nations to listen to their plight and also by fighting against Opec countries that have a different agenda. Opec don't want oil revenues to go down so they tend to prevent as much progressive change as possible. \" Many small nations found it frustrating that the emission rates of a lot of countries had gone up in the past 10 years. \"But we will be back at the next round of negotiations,\" insists Ms Yamin. \"We will be assisting Aosis members in trying to get the heavyweights to reduce their emissions. For our clients, it could literally mean the difference between life and death.\"",

He was also a successful songwriter whose work was recorded by Shirley Bassey and the future Nation of Islam leader, Louis Farrakhan. Born in Radix, Trinidad, Timothy started playing flute at the age of eight, taught by his father Edgar, a carpenter, musician and instrument maker. He taught him violin, too, and, accompanied by a friend playing cuatro, toured the streets during carnival. When he began to play double-bass and alto saxophone, he hid his prowess from his mother, who did not want him to follow a career in music.

      "body": "<p>I first met the poet Bill Scammell, who has died aged 61, in the early 1960s. He and Frank Pike, then at the outset of a distinguished career with Faber's, were running a literary discussion group for the New Left Review. The format for its meetings, held above a cheap and cheerful restaurant in Soho, was simple: an invited person would give a paper, it would be followed by a discussion, and then everyone would tumble downstairs for drinks and a bite to eat.</p> <p>I gave a paper on Henry James's The Spoils Of Poynton, about which I recall very little. I do, however, have a clear memory of the genial ferocity of Bill's questions. It was a quality he put to good use in later years, when he became a regular, always entertaining and often illuminating, reviewer of poetry for, among others, the Independent, the London Magazine, and Poetry Review.</p> <p>By then, he had become a much-respected poet, whose first collection, published by Harry Chambers's Peterloo Poets in 1979, won a Cholmondley Award, and established his reputation for wit, craft, and eager, restless observation. But his career as a poet might never have happened.</p> <p>Scammell was born into working-class circumstances in Southampton. Having failed the 11-plus, he was marked down as an educational failure and, once out of school, took a succession of menial jobs before becoming a ship's photographer on the Queens, Elizabeth and Mary. There, to quote from his 1987 collection, Eldorado, he found himself \"in luxury's hard lap\", able to watch and record the goings on of the passengers, of how:</p> <p>On Fancy Dress Night the bloods went wild then dived back into their sober bickering.</p> <p>His time abroad began an educational awakening which continued when he worked as a copywriter for the Potato Marketing Board in Covent Garden. Encouraged by his older brother, the Russian scholar and biographer, Michael Scammell, he enrolled as a mature student at Bristol University to read English and philosophy. Then it was into life as a Workers' Education Association tutor, first in the Cotswolds, later in the Lake District, where he moved with his artist wife, Jackie, and their two sons, in the mid-1970s.</p> <p>Scammell at first wanted to write fiction, \"but,\" he once said to me, \"every time I sit down to write a story, the damned thing turns into a poem\". After the justly admired and much-praised Yes And No, he decided that poetry was what he had to write, and in rapid succession came A Second Life (1982), Jouissance (1985) and Eldorado (1987), all published by Peterloo, and all marked by Scammell's characteristic sardonic wit, his gift for button-holing lines and vivid descriptions, and his fascination with testing forms - from rhyming couplets through sonnets to that most difficult of all stanzas, Pushkin's tetrasyllabic tightly-rhyming 14-liner, a form he handled with typical panache in Stare At The Moon, from Bleeding Heart Yard. That collection, published in 1992, the same year as The Game Tennis Poems, marked the end of his association with Chambers.</p> <p>His next volume, Five Easy Pieces, was published in 1993 under the imprint of Sinclair-Stevenson. The emergence of this ambitiously conceived list, at a time when many commercial publishers were choosing to regard poetry as an expendable item, seemed good news. But all too soon it went belly up, and Scammell was left without a publisher. Then, in 1994, the Dublin based Dedalus Press brought out a small collection, Barnacle Bill, Scammell's last major collection. All Set To Fall Off The Edge Of The World was published by Flambard Press two years ago.</p> <p>The loss of a publisher especially irked him because he had taken early retirement from the WEA to concentrate on literary work. This included editing anthologies and putting together Winter Pollen (1983), a collection of the critical writings of Ted Hughes, whom he much admired and with whom he became friendly, as he did with Derek Mahon, another poet whose work he hugely respected.</p> <p>It may seem odd that Scammell held these widely different poets in equally high regard, but the uncompromising, northern darkness of the one, and Mahon's formal grace, spoke to an element deep within (as did the poetry of the American Louis Simpson), and helps to explain Scammell's abiding devotion to the poetry of Keith Douglas.</p> <p>Knowing of this, I pressed him to write a critical monograph on Douglas for the series I was then editing for Faber. Bill was initially reluctant. \"I'm not a critic,\" he said. But he was, and a fine one, too; Keith Douglas: A Study (1988) is worthy of its difficult subject.</p> <p>In 1991, he had a six-month stint as creative writing tutor at Nottingham Trent University, and helped to initiate what is now a highly successful MA programme. Tennis was a passion, and he was sufficiently good at it to be for a time, captain of his county team. But it is as a poet and independent-minded critic that he deserves to be remembered. Roy Fuller once called him \"a true poet\", and that seems right.</p> <p>His first marriage was dissolved in 1996. A year later, Bill married Jan, and they moved to Heathfield Cottage, at Aspatria, Cumbria, where he got stuck into vegetable gardening. Jan survives him, as do his first wife and their two sons.</p> <p>\u0095William Neill Scammell, poet, born January 2 1939; died November 29 2000</p>",

This included editing anthologies and putting together Winter Pollen (1983), a collection of the critical writings of Ted Hughes, whom he much admired and with whom he became friendly, as he did with Derek Mahon, another poet whose work he hugely respected. It may seem odd that Scammell held these widely different poets in equally high regard, but the uncompromising, northern darkness of the one, and Mahon's formal grace, spoke to an element deep within (as did the poetry of the American Louis Simpson), and helps to explain Scammell's abiding devotion to the poetry of Keith Douglas. Knowing of this, I pressed him to write a critical monograph on Douglas for the series I was then editing for Faber. Bill was initially reluctant. \"I'm not a critic,\" he said. But he was, and a fine one, too; Keith Douglas: A Study (1988) is worthy of its difficult subject. In 1991, he had a six-month stint as creative writing tutor at Nottingham Trent University, and helped to initiate what is now a highly successful MA programme. Tennis was a passion, and he was sufficiently good at it to be for a time, captain of his county team. But it is as a poet and independent-minded critic that he deserves to be remembered. Roy Fuller once called him \"a true poet\", and that seems right. His first marriage was dissolved in 1996. A year later, Bill married Jan, and they moved to Heathfield Cottage, at Aspatria, Cumbria, where he got stuck into vegetable gardening. Jan survives him, as do his first wife and their two sons. \u0095William Neill Scammell, poet, born January 2 1939; died November 29 2000",

The Brandt Com mission was in the news, so he interviewed Willy Brandt; the Arusha Declaration was in the news, so he interviewed Julius Nyerere, and others, including Nelson Mandela.</p> <p>Throughout, he was a sort of intellectual impresario, finding time simultaneously to start, from London, an academic journal, Third World Quarterly, a monthly magazine called South, and to launch the Third World Foundation. He also wrote books on political matters, and occasional poetry.</p> <p>Gauhar was born at Gujranwala, the eldest of five children of a minor official, and studied at Government College, Lahore. Before partition, he was a broadcaster on All India Radio; after it, he was one of Pakistan's first civil servants. He was soon appointed first secretary of the state bank, moving to become a magistrate in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) and later its deputy home secretary.</p> <p>At the age of 39, after a series of senior government commercial posts, Gauhar was appointed information secretary for the rightwing president, Ayub Khan, and given unprecedented powers to manage the press, a role comparable in many ways to that of Alastair Campbell to Tony Blair (and attracting much of the same sort of obloquy from the general public). During his tenure, draconian laws governing the press were passed, something for which Gauhar later publicly apologised.</p> <p>On leaving the civil service in 1969, he became editor of the quality Pakistani news-paper, Dawn, where he was twice imprisoned, latterly when Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was chief martial law administrator. It was while in jail, with no other reading matter, that Gauhar became deeply absorbed by the Koran, from which he was later to make several distinguished translations, the last one shortly before he died, when he was in great pain and undergoing chemotherapy for cancer.</p> <p>On release from prison, he left Dawn for London. After BCCI went into liquidation, he returned to Pakistan, and more journalism. He poured his energies, his thinking and his skills into the role of editor-in-chief of the Muslim.</p> <p>Latterly, Gauhar restricted himself to an occasional column, but left the newspaper when its editor, ABS Jaffery, was sacked by the owner. In Pakistan, on his death, he was commemorated as \"a very eminent Pakistani\", a man who knew power and how it could be used or abused.</p> <p>He leaves his wife, a son and two daughters.</p> <p>\u0095 Altaf Gauhar, journalist and civil servant, born March 17 1923; died November 14 2000</p>",

The Brandt Com mission was in the news, so he interviewed Willy Brandt; the Arusha Declaration was in the news, so he interviewed Julius Nyerere, and others, including Nelson Mandela. Throughout, he was a sort of intellectual impresario, finding time simultaneously to start, from London, an academic journal, Third World Quarterly, a monthly magazine called South, and to launch the Third World Foundation. He also wrote books on political matters, and occasional poetry. Gauhar was born at Gujranwala, the eldest of five children of a minor official, and studied at Government College, Lahore. Before partition, he was a broadcaster on All India Radio; after it, he was one of Pakistan's first civil servants. He was soon appointed first secretary of the state bank, moving to become a magistrate in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) and later its deputy home secretary. At the age of 39, after a series of senior government commercial posts, Gauhar was appointed information secretary for the rightwing president, Ayub Khan, and given unprecedented powers to manage the press, a role comparable in many ways to that of Alastair Campbell to Tony Blair (and attracting much of the same sort of obloquy from the general public). During his tenure, draconian laws governing the press were passed, something for which Gauhar later publicly apologised. On leaving the civil service in 1969, he became editor of the quality Pakistani news-paper, Dawn, where he was twice imprisoned, latterly when Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was chief martial law administrator. It was while in jail, with no other reading matter, that Gauhar became deeply absorbed by the Koran, from which he was later to make several distinguished translations, the last one shortly before he died, when he was in great pain and undergoing chemotherapy for cancer. On release from prison, he left Dawn for London. After BCCI went into liquidation, he returned to Pakistan, and more journalism. He poured his energies, his thinking and his skills into the role of editor-in-chief of the Muslim. Latterly, Gauhar restricted himself to an occasional column, but left the newspaper when its editor, ABS Jaffery, was sacked by the owner. In Pakistan, on his death, he was commemorated as \"a very eminent Pakistani\", a man who knew power and how it could be used or abused. He leaves his wife, a son and two daughters. \u0095 Altaf Gauhar, journalist and civil servant, born March 17 1923; died November 14 2000",

The leaders of both countries agreed that the border, a 620-mile line across largely uninhabited semi-desert, is to be demarcated by an independent commission in accordance with colonial maps. Bar the odd minor adjustment in either direction, this means that the border's location will remain essentially the same as it was before the war. The Ethiopian prime minister, Meles Zenawi, and the Eritrean president, Isaias Afwerki, former allies against Ethiopia's long-time strongman Mengistu Haile Mariam, shook hands after the signing ceremony. Afterwards, Mr Zenawi pledged his country's commitment \"to the full and scrupulous implementation of the agreement\". \"We believe the signing of the peace agreement will lead us to our pre-eminent task which is the struggle against poverty,\" he said. Mr Afwerki followed suit, expressing his country's \"commitment and desire to forget the past and look for a future of peace and mutual respect\". A star-studded cast of international diplomats, including the UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, and the US secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, was on hand to applaud the success of a six-month peace process. But Mr Annan was quick to play down the formal end to a brutal war which has baffled most analysts. \"It is not enough to silence the guns. As we embrace peace, build trust and work for reconciliation, we must remember that words can inflame or soothe,\" he said. \"We need the best possible atmosphere for implementation of this agreement.\" The two leaders also agreed to exchange prisoners, return displaced people and hear claims for war damages. Some 4,200 UN peacekeepers will monitor the ceasefire. No timetable has been set for the peace process and demarcation of the border, but Mr Annan has said he does not expect UN troops to be stationed on the Horn of Africa for more than a year. Far from yesterday's applause, however, the atmosphere was less encouraging. In Addis Adaba, the Ethiopian government called for victims of the \"Eritrean war of aggression\" to come forward to process compensation claims. While in the Eritrean capital, Asmara, the foreign minister, Ali Sayyid Abdallah, warned that the Ethiopian administration was not trustworthy; it had in the past evaded its commitment to the \"agreements it signed before the ink was dry\", he said.

Every day, more than 60 children in the UK are born or diagnosed with a serious disability, and the vast majority are cared for at home. Parents may be told their child has Down's syndrome, is autistic, or suffers from one of the 1,000 rare syndromes and disorders. Yet it is rare that families are given the support they need. The feelings of isolation, both emotional and physical, can often be acute. Helen and Gary Cumberland were devastated on learning from a geneticist that their two-year-old daughter, Alex, was suffering from Coffin Siris syndrome - a genetic disorder so rare that there are only 79 known cases worldwide. </p> <p>The family was in desperate need of support. Sufferers of the syndrome are distinguished by small stature, mental retardation, pronounced facial features and feeding difficulties. They also have a short life expectancy.

It is hoped that the funding, to be phased in over the next three years, will enable the charity annually to provide support to 21,000 families of newly-diagnosed disabled children. Francine Bates, chief executive of CaF, believes the cash will make a huge difference to thousands of families. \"All too often, parents are left to stumble on information about their child's condition without knowing what support groups are around or what benefits they are entitled to,\" she says.</p> <p>\"We have a fantastic database with all the information about the medical conditions and support groups that exist. But, up until now, our resources have been very limited. We know that parents feel very isolated and vulnerable. Many want to talk to someone, as well as get information about their child's condition. They can find it very useful talking to other families who are in a similar situation. Now we should be able to provide that kind of service to everyone.\"</p> <p>For the Cumberlands, the pressures of coping alone with Alex, while looking after their two other children and a seriously ill relative, put their marriage under an enormous strain.</p> <p> \"It was only when our marriage started cracking up that we received help. I rang a social worker and she put us in touch with Contact A Family,\" says Helen.</p> <p> That was in June last year. Over the next few months, the Cumberlands, who live in Blackburn, Lancashire, made contact with four other families with children suffering Coffin Siris syndrome. \"Being able to talk to families in the same situation as yourself really does help,\" says Helen. \"You need it otherwise you really would go to pieces.\"</p> <p> Alex is now three-and-a-half.

Housing charities have competed with other charities for donations from the public, competed in winning bids for government funds - they even have had to compete for the ear of a minister.\" </p> <p>Mr Best, former director of what is now the National Housing Federation, will be speaking to an invited audience of guests celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Housing Association's Charitable Trust (Hact). He welcomes the achievements of social housing over the past four decades, which have meant that only a tiny proportion of tenants now live in poor conditions and overcrowding, but he will also deliver a less palatable message: that the sector needs to take a hard look at itself. </p> <p>\"Whether it be drug and alcohol abuse, family difficulties that have driven young single people to leave home, racial attacks, bullying or neighbourhood nuisance - the answers lie in social housing landlords cooperating with each other, their residents and other agencies,\" Mr Best said. \"We own the properties, we have the money. But we can't work alone and make decisions at a distance from the very people experiencing the problems.\" </p> <p>While Mr Best welcomes much in the government's housing green paper, from fostering mixed communities to stimulating resident involvement, he is calling on housing charities to join with other agencies to challenge government where policies are clearly failing. </p> <p>\"Housing charities with older residents need to risk the wrath of government in pointing out that very substantial increases in public funding will be needed to meet the care needs of poorer elderly people in the next 40 years,\" Mr Best said. \"There's a lot of sweeping under the carpet as elderly people don't count for very much in terms of votes and they don't make a fuss.\" </p> <p>Hact, which distributes \u00a31m a year to voluntary organisations working on housing-related projects, is using its 40th birthday to review and re-focus its role. But it is determined to retain its community remit. \"Supporting partnerships and networks is the way forward,\" says Heather Petch, Hact's director. \"But it is vital that small organisations are not swallowed up as they reflect diversity and encourage the active involvement of people in need of, and using, the services.\"</p>",

But we can't work alone and make decisions at a distance from the very people experiencing the problems.\" While Mr Best welcomes much in the government's housing green paper, from fostering mixed communities to stimulating resident involvement, he is calling on housing charities to join with other agencies to challenge government where policies are clearly failing. \"Housing charities with older residents need to risk the wrath of government in pointing out that very substantial increases in public funding will be needed to meet the care needs of poorer elderly people in the next 40 years,\" Mr Best said. \"There's a lot of sweeping under the carpet as elderly people don't count for very much in terms of votes and they don't make a fuss.\" Hact, which distributes \u00a31m a year to voluntary organisations working on housing-related projects, is using its 40th birthday to review and re-focus its role. But it is determined to retain its community remit. \"Supporting partnerships and networks is the way forward,\" says Heather Petch, Hact's director. \"But it is vital that small organisations are not swallowed up as they reflect diversity and encourage the active involvement of people in need of, and using, the services.\"",

      "body": "<p>Poverty continues to thrive as the New Policy Institute's excellent poverty audit, published on Monday, grimly reminded everybody. Two decades of brutal, regressive Tory policies, which tripled the numbers living below the poverty line, cannot be wiped out in one parliamentary term. Sensibly, ministers have set themselves a 20-year goal of eliminating child poverty - with an intermediary target of a 50% reduction within 10 years. Even this is a steep challenge. </p> <p>Would a ministry of poverty help? Recently, the Guardian suggested that the prime minister was considering replacing the present social exclusion unit (SEU) with a new department for social inclusion to spearhead an anti-poverty drive in the most deprived areas. The expanded department would carve out responsibility for crucial poverty issues - from John Prescott's DETR, inner city regeneration and 1,370 run-down estates suffering multiple problems, plus possibly 18,000 excluded pupils. </p> <p>Certainly large numbers of poor people live on run-down estates. Indeed, two-thirds of heads of households in all council and housing association homes do not have a job, and 75% have incomes of less than \u00a3200. But the proposal does not make sense.

      "bodyText": "Poverty continues to thrive as the New Policy Institute's excellent poverty audit, published on Monday, grimly reminded everybody. Two decades of brutal, regressive Tory policies, which tripled the numbers living below the poverty line, cannot be wiped out in one parliamentary term. Sensibly, ministers have set themselves a 20-year goal of eliminating child poverty - with an intermediary target of a 50% reduction within 10 years. Even this is a steep challenge. Would a ministry of poverty help? Recently, the Guardian suggested that the prime minister was considering replacing the present social exclusion unit (SEU) with a new department for social inclusion to spearhead an anti-poverty drive in the most deprived areas. The expanded department would carve out responsibility for crucial poverty issues - from John Prescott's DETR, inner city regeneration and 1,370 run-down estates suffering multiple problems, plus possibly 18,000 excluded pupils. Certainly large numbers of poor people live on run-down estates. Indeed, two-thirds of heads of households in all council and housing association homes do not have a job, and 75% have incomes of less than \u00a3200. But the proposal does not make sense. If you want a poverty ministry, you do not start with the DETR. You have to begin with social security, add in employment and the New Deal, and take in tax. Cynics might even call it the department of paid work. The naive might believe that Whitehall departments would welcome losing their most difficult clients - but history shows they fight for every last part of their empires. The impetus for the change was said to be a review of the SEU, published a year ago, which concluded that the unit's work \"has been, on the whole, less enthusiastically received inside government than outside\".

But then Mr Gillespie is not a miracle worker. He's a decent, former miner of 57 who stood up to be counted on behalf of a community he cares for, built around a coal mine that gave him a living for over 35 years. When it closed in 1993, the grime went out of Grimethorpe. But the name stuck. </p> <p>Everybody had heard of the place because it had a world-famous brass band. And as for that name - well, it simply helped to keep alive southern prejudices about the landscape of northern England being all belching chimneys and slagheaps. It gave way to that predictable tale of despair and drug-taking among disillusioned local youth and a consequent sharp rise in vandalism and robbery. End of story. </p> <p>Well, not quite. The latest figures show a very significant reduction in crime in Grimethorpe. Burglaries are down by 23% and car crime by 43%. Judges in the Norwich Union Neighbourhood Watch Awards were impressed enough to give Grimethorpe first prize in the urban section. Next Monday, Mr Gillespie and his association's secretary, Elsie Smith, will be in Brussels to represent the UK in the European crime prevention awards. </p> <p>Whether they win or not, there will be no let-up in their drive to make their village a better and safer place. They can't turn back the clock to the days when Mrs Smith's husband, Bryan, was solo horn player in a Grimethorpe Colliery band full of colliers. They can never recapture the community spirit forged by men working together in harsh, dangerous conditions. But they can continue the steady crawl away from the mid-90s depths of low morale. </p> <p>\"The streets were looking mucky, yobs were strutting around being very verbal, and there were no end of break-ins,\" Mr Gillespie recalls. \"I was talking to a mate of mine and we decided that we'd both had enough. So we went down to the Acorn Centre, home of the Grimethorpe Regeneration Executive, and asked about starting a neighbourhood watch scheme. While we were there, a lady tapped me on the shoulder and introduced herself as the local crime prevention officer. That was it. She put us on the right road.\" </p> <p>But she was careful not to be seen leading the way. Police uniforms are not universally respected, even among law-abiding folk in South Yorkshire pit villages, where they have keen memories of what happened during the 1984-85 miners' strike.\"Anyway,\" says Mr Gillespie, \"it was the Metropolitan police who gave us some hammer during the strike, not the local bobbies.\" Indeed, the local bobbies have since donated more than \u00a325,000 for two youth workers. </p> <p>All the same, Mr Gillespie knew he would be a target for the \"wrong 'uns\" who would see him as a \"grass\" when he went round knocking on doors to generate support for his scheme. He expected trouble and, sure enough, it found him. \"That place on the corner used to be full of druggies,\" he says, pointing through the front window of the house which he and his wife, Kathleen, bought from the coal board for \u00a32,800 in 1983. \"But I only had problems with one of them. He spread nails all over my drive one Friday when I was out at a disco I run for the kiddies. I knew there was something wrong as soon as I pulled in.\" </p> <p>The morning light revealed 38 shining heads embedded in his tyres. When he returned from the garage, there were 10 young men eyeballing him from the wall across the street. He stood and faced them down. Mr Gillespie has suffered back injuries and a heart attack in his hardworking life, but he's not a man to be intimidated. </p> <p>Nor is he a man whose idea of neighbourhood watch is simply sitting behind a lace curtain and dialling the police at regular intervals. His association has become adept at raising funds and ploughing the proceeds back into the community. </p> <p>Security lights have been provided for every elderly resident. A rat-infested piece of wasteland has been transformed into a safe, security-lit parking area and a Portakabin houses a mothers-and-toddlers group in the mornings and a youth club four evenings a week. </p> <p>It's run, voluntarily, by another former miner, Roy Mills, who says that more than 50 youngsters have passed their Duke of Edinburgh Award. </p> <p>Mr Mills and Mr Gillespie used to take their families on camping trips in the days when they earned a good living underground. Perhaps it's hardly surprising that they look back fondly. \"I went to prize-giving day at my grand-daughter's school the other day and dropped on and old mate from the pit,\" Mr Gillespie reveals. \"We started reminiscing and I don't mind admitting we cried over what we'd lost.\" </p> <p>Still, he's realistic enough to understand that the future for his grandchildren depends on the new building, which continues apace on the site of the old colliery.

It takes a moment to sink in that the \"Jo\" she has been chatting to is Harry Potter author JK Rowling, who addressed the event. And Chancellor Gordon Brown mentioned her by name in his speech, thanking her for her work on Merseyside, where she is a Sure Start programme coordinator. </p> <p>\"He came over afterwards and asked me how I was, how my son was and how Sure Start was doing,\" said Ms Chazen. She was laughing, but obviously delighted. \"It's nice to be acknowledged, but it doesn't really matter whether it's Gordon Brown or Anne Brown, as long as I can raise the profile of the project.\" And then she laughed again at the incongruity of it all and how everything has snowballed from the inauspicious start of an unplanned pregnancy seven years ago. </p> <p>Her dual role, as a Sure Start programme coordinator in Liverpool and an executive member of the national council's board, means she is tackling child poverty and single parent issues head on. Ms Chazen, 31, realises she has become something of a figurehead, and feels slightly in awe of the responsibility that brings. Back in April, she spoke at 11 Downing Street at the launch of the lone parents' helpline - again attended by Mr Brown, who later spoke of how moved and inspired he had been by her story of struggle as a single parent to achieve her career ambitions. </p> <p>But she is quick to point out that her experiences are no different from the isolation, anxiety and - more often than not - poverty of millions of other single parents. \"I see myself as a representative, really, and it's great to have the opportunity to give lone parents a voice,\" she said. \"We've had a tremendous year as a charity, with Jo Rowling coming on board and a chancellor who is committed to the eradication of child poverty, just as we are committed to eradicating lone parent poverty.\" </p> <p>Ms Chazen was born in Liverpool and spent five years working for an insurance company after leaving school because she was, by her own admission, aimless. She then decided to study childcare and it was in the middle of the course that she got pregnant. She had her son, Zak, in October 1993 and qualified in January 1994, breastfeeding him in lectures because she was so determined to finish the course. </p> <p>When her relationship foundered, she started on the relentless round of juggling work and childcare. \"I just did it, as others do it,\" she recalled. \"I look back and wonder if I should have done it differently, but I know it was right for me, and I look at Zak now and know it was right for him. I think I said this in Downing Street - that with ambition comes guilt, but at the back of my mind was always that Zak deserves this.\" </p> <p>She has had good family support, she said, and had an early break with a free nursery place. \"I was lucky that when I accessed the nursery it was just before they changed the entry criteria,\" she said. \"I know how hard it is to get a place. Good childcare is equivalent to a good relationship - you need to know it's there and reliable.\" </p> <p>Ms Chazen had a variety of jobs before becoming manager of the creche at Liverpool One Parent Families Trust. She may be an inspiration to Brown, she said, but there she met many lone parents, including fathers, who inspired her. \"You can't stereotype single parents,\" she insisted. \"Only a very low percentage are teenage girls. Of course my own experience has informed my work, and it's all about challenging perceptions.\" She spent a year as chief executive of the trust, and from there it was a natural progression to the national council. </p> <p>Her day job at Sure Start counterpoints her national role. She clearly believes that the project can unlock the potential in areas like Speke, where she is based. Speke, a pre-1939 housing estate at the southernmost end of Liverpool, is an isolated community, landlocked by industrial estates and cut off from the city centre. </p> <p>\"We're talking second and third generation unemployment here,\" said Ms Chazen. Children in the area grow up without expectation of work and, perhaps even more damning, without anger about it. She said: \"There's no: 'I want to be an astronaut when I grow up.' And if we want to break that cycle of deprivation, we have to start with young children. In fact, it goes even further back to babies and antenatal care. </p> <p>\"People tend to stay within the area, and if we want them to access the services Sure Start is offering then we have to provide everything here. We're only in our infancy, but I'm committed to making it work because I believe it can. It's a unique opportunity to break down the barriers and for the community to play a pivotal role.\" </p> <p>Ms Chazen works closely with health visitors, and one of the many issues that have come out of the Sure Start consultation process is the need for people to access the services when they need to - not at the practitioner's convenience. \"As a single parent I know what it's like when you've only had a couple of hours sleep and your baby won't stop crying and you haven't talked to anybody for 18 hours,\" she said. \"It's when you are at your most vulnerable and you need to see someone straight away, not: 'Can you make an appointment, can you come back at 5 o'clock?'\" </p> <p>She remains hopeful about the government's aims of getting 70% of lone parents into work by the end of the decade and ending the catch 22 of the benefit trap. \"It's OK to give us a hand up, and the working families tax credit is making a big difference, but we want to go further,\" she said. \"It's not enough to just manage; single parents want a better quality of life.\" </p> <p>She has no plans to leave Liverpool. She loves her job, loves the city - \"there's just something about the place\" - and her son is settled and happy. But the suspicion lingers that bigger things beckon. A friend jokingly called her the lone parent tsar. \"The funny thing is,\" she said, \"Chazen is a Russian name.\" </p> <p>\u0095 The lone parents' helpline is 0800-018 5026.</p>",

Of course my own experience has informed my work, and it's all about challenging perceptions.\" She spent a year as chief executive of the trust, and from there it was a natural progression to the national council. Her day job at Sure Start counterpoints her national role. She clearly believes that the project can unlock the potential in areas like Speke, where she is based. Speke, a pre-1939 housing estate at the southernmost end of Liverpool, is an isolated community, landlocked by industrial estates and cut off from the city centre. \"We're talking second and third generation unemployment here,\" said Ms Chazen. Children in the area grow up without expectation of work and, perhaps even more damning, without anger about it. She said: \"There's no: 'I want to be an astronaut when I grow up.' And if we want to break that cycle of deprivation, we have to start with young children. In fact, it goes even further back to babies and antenatal care. \"People tend to stay within the area, and if we want them to access the services Sure Start is offering then we have to provide everything here. We're only in our infancy, but I'm committed to making it work because I believe it can. It's a unique opportunity to break down the barriers and for the community to play a pivotal role.\" Ms Chazen works closely with health visitors, and one of the many issues that have come out of the Sure Start consultation process is the need for people to access the services when they need to - not at the practitioner's convenience. \"As a single parent I know what it's like when you've only had a couple of hours sleep and your baby won't stop crying and you haven't talked to anybody for 18 hours,\" she said. \"It's when you are at your most vulnerable and you need to see someone straight away, not: 'Can you make an appointment, can you come back at 5 o'clock?'\" She remains hopeful about the government's aims of getting 70% of lone parents into work by the end of the decade and ending the catch 22 of the benefit trap. \"It's OK to give us a hand up, and the working families tax credit is making a big difference, but we want to go further,\" she said. \"It's not enough to just manage; single parents want a better quality of life.\" She has no plans to leave Liverpool. She loves her job, loves the city - \"there's just something about the place\" - and her son is settled and happy. But the suspicion lingers that bigger things beckon. A friend jokingly called her the lone parent tsar. \"The funny thing is,\" she said, \"Chazen is a Russian name.\" \u0095 The lone parents' helpline is 0800-018 5026.",

The resulting loss of food self-sufficiency is good news for the giant corporate grain exporters, who dictate US trade policy, but bad news for poverty. </p> <p>Since Seattle, countries such India, Kenya and the Dominican Republic have been demanding a WTO food security clause that would allow them to restrict imports in the interests of achieving food self-sufficiency. But the US has systematically blocked the proposal, claiming that it would distort world markets.

The good news is that this is already happening.</p> <p>Next spring sees the launch of the Giving Campaign. It is the brainchild of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO) and the Charities Aid Foundation (CAF), and has the principle aim of focusing attention on the opportunities for increased giving presented by the new tax incentives the chancellor announced earlier this year. These include the abolition of the \u00a3250 minimum for donations through gift aid, which allows the charity to claim back the tax on your gift, and the abolition of the \u00a31,200-a-year limit on payroll giving. There will also be tax relief on gifts, shares and securities and an extension of the tax exemption for fundraising events. </p> <p>Last month saw Treasury Minister Stephen Timms grant \u00a31m of government money toward the campaign. This represents a significant commitment from the government, who also plan to second staff to the campaign team. By the new year the Giving Campaign team expect to have raised an additional half a million for the launch. Generous donations have already been received from across the sector. With ongoing funding, the campaign should run for a total of three years and aims to achieve a \u00a31bn increase in income to the voluntary sector.</p> <p>However, for many in the sector it appears that the government is giving with one hand and taking with the other. While they donate money to our national campaigns they are still refusing to budge on a VAT rebate for charities. It is estimated that this costs the sector \u00a3400m a year. </p> <p>Nonetheless, the government has taken a number of important steps towards stronger support of the voluntary sector in the past three years. The chancellor stated his desire to build a democracy of giving by 2000. Central and local government are turning increasingly to the voluntary sector to help with the delivery of public services and to address issues of health and social exclusion. Income generated through public donation will be enhanced by the tax relief on giving announced in the last budget and other changes to payroll giving and charity trading. Meanwhile, NCVO, with the support of its members, will continue to campaign for VAT rebates and other issues which affect the sector, such as free criminal records checks for volunteers.</p> <p>In the new year, with a general election on the way, it is vital that the voluntary sector focuses on further development of close and equal partnership with government. We must stand firm and independent on issues which affect us all and work together on improving public understanding and knowledge of the good work we do. The Giving Campaign will be a splendid way to kick off the first new year of a new millennium and will, I am sure, play a significant role in reversing the decline in giving that we have witnessed over the past decade.</p>",

There will also be tax relief on gifts, shares and securities and an extension of the tax exemption for fundraising events. Last month saw Treasury Minister Stephen Timms grant \u00a31m of government money toward the campaign. This represents a significant commitment from the government, who also plan to second staff to the campaign team. By the new year the Giving Campaign team expect to have raised an additional half a million for the launch. Generous donations have already been received from across the sector. With ongoing funding, the campaign should run for a total of three years and aims to achieve a \u00a31bn increase in income to the voluntary sector. However, for many in the sector it appears that the government is giving with one hand and taking with the other. While they donate money to our national campaigns they are still refusing to budge on a VAT rebate for charities. It is estimated that this costs the sector \u00a3400m a year. Nonetheless, the government has taken a number of important steps towards stronger support of the voluntary sector in the past three years. The chancellor stated his desire to build a democracy of giving by 2000. Central and local government are turning increasingly to the voluntary sector to help with the delivery of public services and to address issues of health and social exclusion. Income generated through public donation will be enhanced by the tax relief on giving announced in the last budget and other changes to payroll giving and charity trading. Meanwhile, NCVO, with the support of its members, will continue to campaign for VAT rebates and other issues which affect the sector, such as free criminal records checks for volunteers. In the new year, with a general election on the way, it is vital that the voluntary sector focuses on further development of close and equal partnership with government. We must stand firm and independent on issues which affect us all and work together on improving public understanding and knowledge of the good work we do. The Giving Campaign will be a splendid way to kick off the first new year of a new millennium and will, I am sure, play a significant role in reversing the decline in giving that we have witnessed over the past decade.",

While poor countries have liberalised their markets, rich countries have remained resolutely protectionist, especially in areas like textiles and agriculture.

Take the issue of protectionism. It's not mentioned in Short's white paper, but each year, developing countries lose around $700bn (\u00a3484bn) as a result of trade barriers in rich countries. Stated differently, for every $1 provided by the rich world in the form of aid and debt relief, poor countries lose another $14 because of trade barriers. Reducing these barriers would help to create jobs and take millions of people out of poverty. </p> <p>Unfortunately, the post-Seattle record is abysmal.

It is not just that they result in poor countries losing export markets. Rural livelihoods are also being destroyed on a massive scale because poor farmers in Africa, Asia, and Latin America cannot compete against subsidised imports. The resulting loss of food self-reliance is good news for the giant corporate grain exporters, who dictate US trade policy, but bad news for poverty. </p> <p>Since Seattle, countries such India, Kenya and the Dominican Republic have been demanding a WTO food security clause that would allow them to restrict imports in the interests of achieving food self-sufficiency. But the US has systematically blocked the proposal, claiming that it would distort world markets. In reality, the WTO is being used to ensure that US commercial interests supersede basic human rights. </p> <p>The same principle applies to WTO rules on patents.

      "body": "<p>Green campaigners are gearing up for a battle in Hastings over plans to build new roads through an area of outstanding natural beauty round the Victorian seaside town. Environmentalists say they'll provoke a major Swampy-style conflict if ministers approve the roads when the Hastings multi-modal transport study lands on their desks in the new year. The study is seen as a key test, as it is the first of around 30 reports on potentially controversial road schemes due in the next few months, and activists threaten to make Hastings a cause celebre like Newbury or Twyford Down. </p> <p>The Hastings study is complex, detailed and taut with policy conflicts at the heart of the debate over sustainable development. It says the planned roads could potentially bring new jobs to the Sussex town, which has some of the worst pockets of deprivation in the south-east. But it warns that the bypasses would wreck the tranquil countryside by throwing a high embankment along a flood plain in the High Weald area of Sussex where wildlife abounds and the field system has remained unchanged for centuries. </p> <p>The consultants' report recommends a package of local improvements, including more dual carriageway on the A21 to cut journey times to the M25, and a faster rail link to the Chunnel station at Ashford. But it says it cannot make a recommendation on the bypasses because although they could have major economic benefits, they are in direct conflict with stated government policy to avoid new roads significantly affecting prime countryside unless there is overwhelming national interest. </p> <p>Unless John Prescott is prepared to abandon the government's countryside protection pledge, the decision could hinge on whether the proposed roads are of national significance. Figures in the report show that in purely traffic terms they are not. Ninety-five per cent of vehicles on the main road along the Hastings sea front are local, and the bypasses would primarily help suburban drivers to scoot from one edge of the city to the other (slightly increasing greenhouse gas emissions in the process). The roads, though, would also potentially improve the urban environment by creating more space for pedestrians, cyclists and buses at the sea front. </p> <p>These may not be sufficient criteria for overriding the presumption against roads in areas of beauty, but there is another factor: the need to improve the local economy. Hastings is a charming Victorian seaside resort suffering from a fall in family holiday visitors and a near collapse in the local fishing industry. Houses are cheap and the town has provided an overspill for London's boroughs who offered long-term unemployed people grants to buy flats by the sea if they relinquished their rights to homes in the capital. This policy, coupled with the long-term decline in local jobs, has left Hastings with five council wards which sink into the bottom 10% of the UK deprivation tables, measured by health, education, skills and access to services. Among the workforce, 5.4% are unemployed, although Hastings has admittedly seen a better than average surge in job creation in the last five years. When the bypass was discussed before the election, the jobless total stood at 12%. </p> <p>Some local firms say they would like to have the option of expanding but there is a shortage of industrial space, and the study concludes that the balance of evidence suggests the area will only be regenerated if a business park is built on a 70-hectare greenfield site to the north-west of the town. The factories would be accompanied by a housing estate, and unlocking the land in a picturesque valley will mean building the western bypass - an option overwhelming supported by business. </p> <p>But there are several snags. The first is over the environment: the study concludes that the western bypass would create too many traffic jams unless it were built in conjunction with the eastern bypass, which wrecks an area of outstanding natural beauty. The second snag concerns the economic analysis itself. The study accepts that new business park jobs are not guaranteed because major firms are likely to avoid Hastings because of its location and its lack of an obvious drawcard, such as a university.

(Employers in the town say that their biggest problem is a shortage of skills - not a shortage of premises.) </p> <p>In the worst case, it says, the new developments could actually harm the town. Existing firms might shift to the new business park, leaving black holes behind. Or new employers in the business park might bid up the local low wage levels and threaten the competitiveness of existing employers. The study also forecasts that the bypass-related developments will actually increase unemployment in Hastings town itself, and that the new out-of-town jobs will be hard to reach for the poorest who do not drive. There is another imponderable not considered by the study: what happens if the new out-of-town homes lure existing families out of Hastings, leaving behind even more vacant properties in the town which already has 9.6% of homes empty - almost double the national average. </p> <p>The jobs arithmetic bears closer examination too. The study says that in a best case scenario, the business park could create 2,000 jobs, with a potential for 500-1,000 extra jobs if the wealth trickles down through the local economy. But let us suppose that each of the 1,500 new greenfield homes has 1.5 adult workers: that necessitates 2,250 jobs ... leaving either 250 or 750 for local people, depending on the level of optimism over the extent of trickle-down. On the other hand, the study says that job creation schemes within Hastings town itself, which are not covered by the study, could create up to 700 jobs without the bypass or the new homes being built - with a concomitant saving of \u00a3130m of public money. This would leave the jobless figure of Hastings at 3.5%. </p> <p>When the study was originally commissioned, the idea was to examine broader economic issues like this. Would public money be better spent on transport - or on education, training, tourism developments, micro job schemes or housing improvements? This exercise in joined-up government was deemed too unwieldy and ended as an exercise in joined-up transport planning, to the dismay of some local councillors. </p> <p> In their struggle to come to a decision on the issue, ministers are advised by the study to take note of public opinion: a survey shows that 63% of local people want the western bypass, following a long campaign by businesses, councillors and the media.

      "bodyText": "Green campaigners are gearing up for a battle in Hastings over plans to build new roads through an area of outstanding natural beauty round the Victorian seaside town. Environmentalists say they'll provoke a major Swampy-style conflict if ministers approve the roads when the Hastings multi-modal transport study lands on their desks in the new year. The study is seen as a key test, as it is the first of around 30 reports on potentially controversial road schemes due in the next few months, and activists threaten to make Hastings a cause celebre like Newbury or Twyford Down. The Hastings study is complex, detailed and taut with policy conflicts at the heart of the debate over sustainable development. It says the planned roads could potentially bring new jobs to the Sussex town, which has some of the worst pockets of deprivation in the south-east. But it warns that the bypasses would wreck the tranquil countryside by throwing a high embankment along a flood plain in the High Weald area of Sussex where wildlife abounds and the field system has remained unchanged for centuries. The consultants' report recommends a package of local improvements, including more dual carriageway on the A21 to cut journey times to the M25, and a faster rail link to the Chunnel station at Ashford. But it says it cannot make a recommendation on the bypasses because although they could have major economic benefits, they are in direct conflict with stated government policy to avoid new roads significantly affecting prime countryside unless there is overwhelming national interest. Unless John Prescott is prepared to abandon the government's countryside protection pledge, the decision could hinge on whether the proposed roads are of national significance. Figures in the report show that in purely traffic terms they are not. Ninety-five per cent of vehicles on the main road along the Hastings sea front are local, and the bypasses would primarily help suburban drivers to scoot from one edge of the city to the other (slightly increasing greenhouse gas emissions in the process). The roads, though, would also potentially improve the urban environment by creating more space for pedestrians, cyclists and buses at the sea front. These may not be sufficient criteria for overriding the presumption against roads in areas of beauty, but there is another factor: the need to improve the local economy. Hastings is a charming Victorian seaside resort suffering from a fall in family holiday visitors and a near collapse in the local fishing industry. Houses are cheap and the town has provided an overspill for London's boroughs who offered long-term unemployed people grants to buy flats by the sea if they relinquished their rights to homes in the capital.

      "body": "<p>Karen Chazen is on a high after attending the annual meeting of the National Council for One Parent Families. It takes a moment to sink in that the \"Jo\" she has been chatting to is JK Rowling, who addressed the event. And Gordon Brown, the chancellor, mentioned her by name in his speech, thanking her for her work on Merseyside, where she is a Sure Start programme co-ordinator. </p> <p>\"He came over afterwards and asked me how I was, how my son was and how Sure Start was doing,\" says Chazen. She is laughing, but obviously delighted. \"It's nice to be acknowledged, but it doesn't really matter whether it's Gordon Brown or Anne Brown, as long as I can raise the profile of the project.\" And then she is laughing again at the incongruity of it all and how everything has snowballed from the inauspicious start of an unplanned pregnancy seven years ago. </p> <p>Her dual role, as a Sure Start programme co-ordinator in Liverpool and an executive member of the national council's board, means she is tackling child poverty and single parent issues head on. Chazen, 31, realises she has become something of a figurehead, and feels slightly in awe of the responsibility that brings. Back in April, she spoke at 11 Downing Street at the launch of the lone parents' helpline - again attended by Brown, who later spoke of how moved and inspired he had been by her story of struggle as a single parent to achieve her career ambitions. </p> <p>But she is quick to point out that her experiences are no different from the isolation, anxiety and - more often than not - poverty of millions of other single parents. \"I see myself as a representative, really, and it's great to have the opportunity to give lone parents a voice,\" she says. \"We've had a tremendous year as a charity, with Jo Rowling coming on board and a chancellor who is committed to the eradication of child poverty, just as we are committed to eradicating lone parent poverty.\" </p> <p>Chazen was born in Liverpool and spent five years working for an insurance company after leaving school because she was, by her own admission, aimless. She then decided to study childcare and it was in the middle of the course that she got pregnant. She had her son, Zak, in October 1993 and qualified in January 1994, breastfeeding him in lectures because she was so determined to finish the course. </p> <p>When her relationship foundered, she started on the relentless round of juggling work and childcare. \"I just did it, as others do it,\" she recalls. \"I look back and wonder if I should have done it differently, but I know it was right for me, and I look at Zak now and know it was right for him. I think I said this in Downing Street - that with ambition comes guilt, but at the back of my mind was always that Zak deserves this.\" </p> <p>She has had good family support, she says, and had an early break with a free nursery place. \"I was lucky that when I accessed the nursery it was just before they changed the entry criteria,\" she says. \"I know how hard it is to get a place. Good childcare is equivalent to a good relationship - you need to know it's there and reliable.\" </p> <p>Chazen had a variety of jobs before becoming manager of the creche at Liverpool One Parent Families Trust. She may be an inspiration to Brown, she says, but there she met many lone parents, including fathers, who inspired her. \"You can't stereotype single parents,\" she insists. \"Only a very low percentage are teenage girls. Of course my own experience has informed my work, and it's all about challenging perceptions.\" She spent a year as chief executive of the trust, and from there it was a natural progression to the national council. </p> <p>Her day job at Sure Start counterpoints her national role. She clearly believes that the project can unlock the potential in areas like Speke, where she is based. Speke, a pre-1939 housing estate at the southernmost end of Liverpool, is an isolated community, landlocked by industrial estates and cut off from the city centre. </p> <p>\"We're talking second and third generation unemployment here,\" says Chazen. Children in the area grow up without expectation of work and, perhaps even more damning, without anger about it. She says: \"There's no: 'I want to be an astronaut when I grow up.' And if we want to break that cycle of deprivation, we have to start with young children. In fact, it goes even further back to babies and antenatal care. </p> <p>\"People tend to stay within the area, and if we want them to access the services Sure Start is offering then we have to provide everything here. We're only in our infancy, but I'm committed to making it work because I believe it can. It's a unique opportunity to break down the barriers and for the community to play a pivotal role.\" </p> <p>Chazen works closely with health visitors, and one of the many issues that have come out of the Sure Start consultation process is the need for people to access the services when they need to - not at the practitioner's convenience. \"As a single parent I know what it's like when you've only had a couple of hours sleep and your baby won't stop crying and you haven't talked to anybody for 18 hours,\" she says. \"It's when you are at your most vulnerable and you need to see someone straight away, not: 'Can you make an appointment, can you come back at 5 o'clock?'\" </p> <p>She remains hopeful about the government's aims of getting 70% of lone parents into work by the end of the decade and ending the catch 22 of the benefit trap. \"It's OK to give us a hand up, and the working families tax credit is making a big difference, but we want to go further,\" she says. \"It's not enough to just manage; single parents want a better quality of life.\" </p> <p>She has no plans to leave Liverpool. She loves her job, loves the city - \"there's just something about the place\" - and her son is settled and happy. But the suspicion lingers that bigger things beckon. A friend jokingly called her the lone parent tsar. \"The funny thing is,\" she says, \"Chazen is a Russian name.\" </p> <p>\u0095 The lone parents' helpline is 0800-018 5026.</p>",

      "body": "<p>It's Saturday night in a church hall. But this is no youth club dance. Nor is it a typical church meeting. Instead, five people are quietly meeting to help a paedophile reintegrate into the community. </p> <p>This is the first British meeting of a \"circle of support and accountability\". Together, the members of the circle are working out a mutual agreement which will reduce risk - risk to the community, risk to his victims and risk to himself. </p> <p>The circle model has worked successfully in Canada for six years.If this new model works here too, it could radically improve the care and supervision on release of some of the more dangerous of Britain's 100,000-plus convicted sex offenders. </p> <p>Darren (not his real name) is 36. A former alcoholic, over 20 years he has collected a number of convictions for indecently assaulting adolescent females and young adult women. After six months in prison for sexual abuse, he underwent 15 months' intensive therapy at Wolvercote Clinic in Epsom, Surrey, which focuses on reducing abuse by assessing and treating sex offenders. His time at the clinic ended last month. </p> <p>Donald Findlater, clinic manager at Wolvercote, regularly sees men leave the clinic or prison who are going out to nobody. \"Their former family and friends - if they ever had any - may well have fallen by the wayside,\" he says. \"Without a job, or other support, some end up sleeping in night shelters, living on the streets, and returning to drink.\" </p> <p>Many of those obliged by the terms of their release from prison to keep in contact with the hard-pressed probation service may have only very limited contact - weekly meetings initially, reducing to monthly meetings after a relatively short period. </p> <p>Findlater reckoned there must be a better way to reduce the risk of re-offending. Last June, he attended a workshop run by the Religious Society of Friends in Britain, the Quakers. Five Canadians addressed representatives from the Home Office, police, probation services, church groups and charities. The Canadians described a new scheme set up to deal with similar problems in Canada. Backed by the Mennonite Church and founded in Ontario, the scheme offers support for offenders with no one else to turn to, and tries to reassure public fears by encouraging members of the local community to play a part in the rehabilitation process. </p> <p>It is a practical response to the kind of fear generated by the indiscriminate attacks on paedophiles and others triggered by the News of the World campaign last August \"naming and shaming\" released paedophiles. </p> <p>The circles usually consist of between four and six people. A covenant is drawn up among all the members of the circle, detailing their expectations and what happens if they are broken. The \"core member\" (the sex offender) must state that he is committed to \"no more victims of sexual abuse\". </p> <p>Knowing Darren would need support when he left the Wolvercote this month, Findlater decided to set up a pilot scheme himself. \"I'm an impatient sort, and I wanted to see something live and kicking,\" he says. </p> <p>He began by phoning three or four church leaders he knew in the area where Darren was going to live. \"I told them I'd got this crazy idea about how the church could help sex offenders live safely in their community, and what did they think?\" </p> <p>He then introduced the idea to a wider group of their contacts. \"They were very positive about the concept, but remarkably pessimistic about finding volunteers with that much time to commit.\" </p> <p>In the first few weeks the core member meets the group every week and talks to at least one member every day. The circle may continue for one, two or three years, though members may change. </p> <p>Volunteers do not need social work or counselling experience. \"We wanted people who had a life, and were willing to share that life,\" says Findlater. \"It helps if they are wise, and a bit cautious, people with their feet on the ground, not too prurient, and not easily shocked. It's not a mind-delving exercise. It's befriending.\" </p> <p>In October he went to see for himself the Canadian scheme working.

      "bodyText": "It's Saturday night in a church hall. But this is no youth club dance. Nor is it a typical church meeting. Instead, five people are quietly meeting to help a paedophile reintegrate into the community. This is the first British meeting of a \"circle of support and accountability\". Together, the members of the circle are working out a mutual agreement which will reduce risk - risk to the community, risk to his victims and risk to himself. The circle model has worked successfully in Canada for six years.If this new model works here too, it could radically improve the care and supervision on release of some of the more dangerous of Britain's 100,000-plus convicted sex offenders. Darren (not his real name) is 36. A former alcoholic, over 20 years he has collected a number of convictions for indecently assaulting adolescent females and young adult women. After six months in prison for sexual abuse, he underwent 15 months' intensive therapy at Wolvercote Clinic in Epsom, Surrey, which focuses on reducing abuse by assessing and treating sex offenders. His time at the clinic ended last month. Donald Findlater, clinic manager at Wolvercote, regularly sees men leave the clinic or prison who are going out to nobody. \"Their former family and friends - if they ever had any - may well have fallen by the wayside,\" he says. \"Without a job, or other support, some end up sleeping in night shelters, living on the streets, and returning to drink.\" Many of those obliged by the terms of their release from prison to keep in contact with the hard-pressed probation service may have only very limited contact - weekly meetings initially, reducing to monthly meetings after a relatively short period. Findlater reckoned there must be a better way to reduce the risk of re-offending. Last June, he attended a workshop run by the Religious Society of Friends in Britain, the Quakers. Five Canadians addressed representatives from the Home Office, police, probation services, church groups and charities. The Canadians described a new scheme set up to deal with similar problems in Canada. Backed by the Mennonite Church and founded in Ontario, the scheme offers support for offenders with no one else to turn to, and tries to reassure public fears by encouraging members of the local community to play a part in the rehabilitation process. It is a practical response to the kind of fear generated by the indiscriminate attacks on paedophiles and others triggered by the News of the World campaign last August \"naming and shaming\" released paedophiles. The circles usually consist of between four and six people. A covenant is drawn up among all the members of the circle, detailing their expectations and what happens if they are broken. The \"core member\" (the sex offender) must state that he is committed to \"no more victims of sexual abuse\". Knowing Darren would need support when he left the Wolvercote this month, Findlater decided to set up a pilot scheme himself. \"I'm an impatient sort, and I wanted to see something live and kicking,\" he says. He began by phoning three or four church leaders he knew in the area where Darren was going to live. \"I told them I'd got this crazy idea about how the church could help sex offenders live safely in their community, and what did they think?\" He then introduced the idea to a wider group of their contacts. \"They were very positive about the concept, but remarkably pessimistic about finding volunteers with that much time to commit.\" In the first few weeks the core member meets the group every week and talks to at least one member every day. The circle may continue for one, two or three years, though members may change. Volunteers do not need social work or counselling experience. \"We wanted people who had a life, and were willing to share that life,\" says Findlater. \"It helps if they are wise, and a bit cautious, people with their feet on the ground, not too prurient, and not easily shocked. It's not a mind-delving exercise. It's befriending.\" In October he went to see for himself the Canadian scheme working. He and the coordinator in Toronto spent a day out at Niagara Falls with a former sex offender. Later they all dropped in to see the coordinator's sister, then went on to eat pizza at a party. \"It's not about giving them a bit of your time, it's more about doing things together whether playing computer games, table tennis, or going for a walk. Sometimes this creates community that the core member may never have had before.\" He says he approached church people to help find volunteers because of the Christian belief in the value of every human being, and that everyone could be encouraged to make a constructive contribution. But he is absolutely clear that joining a circle is not an evangelistic activity. \"We don't want people coming along with the aim of saving someone's soul. Not because I don't believe it, but I don't think it's a helpful starting point. Instead, it's closer to the words of Jesus: 'I was in prison, and you visited me'.\" He also reckons the churches have a lot to learn. \"They need to exercise more caution, and open their eyes a bit wider. There's evidence that church communities contain a higher rate of sex offenders than the community as a whole. I hope a bi-product of this might be more vigilance in their own communities.\" In the future, he says he would welcome volunteers of all faiths as well as non-believers. Four volunteers between 35 and 50 emerged for Darren's circle: Findlater himself, a quantity surveyor, a community worker and a church minister. Five detailed training sessions covered the legal and social context, and information about the behaviour of sex offenders. They also covered the purpose and aims of developing a personal plan for the core member to prevent re-offending, and a background briefing on Darren himself. The female member of the group decided to meet Darren only in public places, not at her home. There was also the question of who they could share their involvement with.

      "body": "<p>Poverty continues to thrive as the New Policy Institute's excellent poverty audit, published on Monday, grimly reminded everybody. Two decades of brutal, regressive Tory policies, which tripled the numbers living below the poverty line, cannot be wiped out in one parliamentary term. Sensibly, ministers have set themselves a 20-year goal of eliminating child poverty - with an intermediary target of a 50% reduction within 10 years. Even this is a steep challenge. </p> <p>Would a ministry of poverty help? Recently, the Guardian suggested that the prime minister was considering replacing the present social exclusion unit (SEU) with a new department for social inclusion to spearhead an anti-poverty drive in the most deprived areas. The expanded department would carve out responsibility for crucial poverty issues - from John Prescott's DETR, inner city regeneration and 1,370 run-down estates suffering multiple problems, plus possibly 18,000 excluded pupils. </p> <p>Certainly large numbers of poor people live on run-down estates. Indeed, two-thirds of heads of households in all council and housing association homes do not have a job, and 75% have incomes of less than \u00a3200. But the proposal does not make sense.

      "bodyText": "Poverty continues to thrive as the New Policy Institute's excellent poverty audit, published on Monday, grimly reminded everybody. Two decades of brutal, regressive Tory policies, which tripled the numbers living below the poverty line, cannot be wiped out in one parliamentary term. Sensibly, ministers have set themselves a 20-year goal of eliminating child poverty - with an intermediary target of a 50% reduction within 10 years. Even this is a steep challenge. Would a ministry of poverty help? Recently, the Guardian suggested that the prime minister was considering replacing the present social exclusion unit (SEU) with a new department for social inclusion to spearhead an anti-poverty drive in the most deprived areas. The expanded department would carve out responsibility for crucial poverty issues - from John Prescott's DETR, inner city regeneration and 1,370 run-down estates suffering multiple problems, plus possibly 18,000 excluded pupils. Certainly large numbers of poor people live on run-down estates. Indeed, two-thirds of heads of households in all council and housing association homes do not have a job, and 75% have incomes of less than \u00a3200. But the proposal does not make sense. If you want a poverty ministry, you do not start with the DETR. You have to begin with social security, add in employment and the New Deal, and take in tax. Cynics might even call it the department of paid work. The naive might believe that Whitehall departments would welcome losing their most difficult clients - but history shows they fight for every last part of their empires.

Homelessness agencies in Cambridge, who designed this approach and bid for these funds, know they face a big challenge, but their frontline workers are backing it because it offers, at last, real long-term prospects of change for many individuals. Ian Nimmo-Smith Liberal Democrat chairman Mike Talbot Labour spokesperson Chris Howell Conservative spokesperson Housing and health committee, Cambridge city council Population problems The article about using \"ecological footprints\" as a way of seeing the unsustainability of people's or communities' lifestyles (Map of your life, November 29) was good at showing the undeniable physical realities of our planet, which many members ignore, but omitted some obvious arithmetical logic . If a group of people is living unsustainably, the unsustainable footprint is a product (in the arithmetical sense) of the per capita real land usage and the number of people involved. So, of course, a less profligate lifestyle helps, but so too does a lower population - yet there was no mention of this point. Drastic short-term cuts in average consumption levels of just about everything - primarily among the world's richer people - are crucial. But, logically, decreases in population density in the longer term can make this less painful. Doing my bit by remaining childless ...

In its first year it sold just 7,000 packs of Christmas cards and made \u00a325,000, of which 66% of the retail price, less VAT, went to those charities that had sold their cards to the company to sell online. This year, managing director William Ruffman reports a fivefold increase in sales.

      "body": "<p>Local government ombudsman Jerry White has branded North Warwickshire council's behaviour \"scandalous\", following the authority's refusal to pay \u00a34,500 compensation to a couple whose home it failed to provide with mandatory disabled adaptations. The case highlights the ombudsman's lack of power to enforce findings. </p> <p>Six months after his initial call for compensation was ignored by North Warwickshire, a second report from White is calling on the council to fulfil his recommended remedy for the injustice. </p> <p>White upheld the couple's initial complaint that the council failed to comply with its statutory duty when dealing with their application for adaptations to their council property to enable the wife, who is registered disabled, to continue living there. As a result of the failure, the couple spent more than two years living in unsuitable conditions. </p> <p>The ombudsman found maladministration causing injustice, and recommended the council pay the complainants \u00a34,500, offer them the choice of adaptations or suitable rehousing, and review its procedures for disabled adaptations for council-owned properties. </p> <p>The Labour-run council agreed to carry out the adaptations as soon as possible, but declined to pay compensation on grounds that the couple had refused an offer of alternative accommodation and that compensation would have to come from its disabled facilities budget. </p> <p>In a further report, White says: \"It was for Mr and Mrs North [not their real names] to be persuaded that any offer of alternative accommodation, given their personal circumstances and given Mrs North's needs as a disabled person was acceptable ... and I see no reason why the compensation should be met from the budget set aside for people with disabilities. The council's intentions to do so adds insult to injury and is further discrimination against disabled people in its area.\" </p> <p>North Warwickshire is declining to respond.

      "bodyText": "Local government ombudsman Jerry White has branded North Warwickshire council's behaviour \"scandalous\", following the authority's refusal to pay \u00a34,500 compensation to a couple whose home it failed to provide with mandatory disabled adaptations. The case highlights the ombudsman's lack of power to enforce findings. Six months after his initial call for compensation was ignored by North Warwickshire, a second report from White is calling on the council to fulfil his recommended remedy for the injustice. White upheld the couple's initial complaint that the council failed to comply with its statutory duty when dealing with their application for adaptations to their council property to enable the wife, who is registered disabled, to continue living there. As a result of the failure, the couple spent more than two years living in unsuitable conditions. The ombudsman found maladministration causing injustice, and recommended the council pay the complainants \u00a34,500, offer them the choice of adaptations or suitable rehousing, and review its procedures for disabled adaptations for council-owned properties. The Labour-run council agreed to carry out the adaptations as soon as possible, but declined to pay compensation on grounds that the couple had refused an offer of alternative accommodation and that compensation would have to come from its disabled facilities budget. In a further report, White says: \"It was for Mr and Mrs North [not their real names] to be persuaded that any offer of alternative accommodation, given their personal circumstances and given Mrs North's needs as a disabled person was acceptable ... and I see no reason why the compensation should be met from the budget set aside for people with disabilities. The council's intentions to do so adds insult to injury and is further discrimination against disabled people in its area.\" North Warwickshire is declining to respond. Peter Oliver, director of administration, says: \"We will be considering the report at a meeting of housing services in January which will make recommendations to full council.\" Should the council stick to its guns, the ombudsman will be powerless to make it cough up. While the couple may be able to challenge the council through a judicial review, on the rare occasions when councils refuse to accept the ombudsman's recommendations - four cases out of 33,000 in the past two years - the ombudsman cannot legally force them. Surprisingly, White is the first to jump to the defence of what amounts to a voluntary system. \"Lots of people would like our decisions to be legally binding, but I believe it would make the investigative process much harder if elected members felt they had no choice but to abide by our decisions,\" he says. \"Currently most councils willingly comply with our investigations and the vast majority comply with the recommendations. If it were more legalistic, we would not have a such a high success rate.\" White says that councils have a change of heart in half of all cases where a second report is issued. To assist North Warwickshire's thought process, he has sent copies of his further report to the minister for disabled people and the disability rights commission. If all else fails, the ombudsman can require the council to publish a statement in a local newspaper setting out why he considers the authority's response to be unsatisfactory.

The three hospitals we report on today are well run; they all have areas that demonstrate very good practice in the health service; and they all have aspects that need improvement. In writing the reports, we have tried to present a picture of the hospitals that their local communities and staff would recognise. Unsurprisingly, these pictures are a blend of strength and areas for improvement. My hope is that, in conveying our reports to local communities, local news and broadcast journalists will reflect that balance. Each of the hospitals we report on today has produced a comprehensive action plan to address the issues the report raises. These action plans are very important. They give local people a way of being sure that the hospitals have taken our reports seriously and are doing something about them. But it should not only be the staff of those hospitals and their communities who are interested in today's reports. I hope that people everywhere will read them and use them to ask questions about their local health services and what they are doing to improve the quality of care they offer to patients. I also hope that health service staff across the country use them to help assess their own care of patients. The commission has set out a bold aim - to bring about demonstrable improvement in patient care in the NHS. Our first three reports represent a major force for that improvement. \u0095 Peter Homa will be answering questions online at 2.30pm today about the work of the CHI, at www.SocietyGuardian.co.uk Peter Homa is chief executive of the commission for health improvement",

      "body": "<p>It's Saturday night in a church hall. But this is no youth club dance. Nor is it a typical church meeting. Instead, five people are quietly meeting to help a paedophile reintegrate into the community. </p> <p>This is the first British meeting of a \"circle of support and accountability\". Together, the members of the circle are working out a mutual agreement which will reduce risk - risk to the community, risk to his victims and risk to himself. </p> <p>The circle model has worked successfully in Canada for six years.If this new model works here too, it could radically improve the care and supervision on release of some of the more dangerous of Britain's 100,000-plus convicted sex offenders. </p> <p>Darren (not his real name) is 36. A former alcoholic, over 20 years he has collected a number of convictions for indecently assaulting adolescent females and young adult women. After six months in prison for sexual abuse, he underwent 15 months' intensive therapy at Wolvercote clinic in Epsom, Surrey, which focuses on reducing abuse by assessing and treating sex offenders. His time at the clinic ended last month. </p> <p>Donald Findlater, clinic manager at Wolvercote, regularly sees men leave the clinic or prison who are going out to nobody. \"Their former family and friends - if they ever had any - may well have fallen by the wayside,\" he said. \"Without a job, or other support, some end up sleeping in night shelters, living on the streets, and returning to drink.\" </p> <p>Many of those obliged by the terms of their release from prison to keep in contact with the hard-pressed probation service may have only very limited contact - weekly meetings initially, reducing to monthly meetings after a relatively short period. </p> <p>Findlater reckoned there must be a better way to reduce the risk of re-offending. Last June, he attended a workshop run by the Religious Society of Friends in Britain, the Quakers. Five Canadians addressed representatives from the Home Office, police, probation services, church groups and charities. The Canadians described a new scheme set up to deal with similar problems in Canada. Backed by the Mennonite Church and founded in Ontario, the scheme offers support for offenders with no one else to turn to, and tries to reassure public fears by encouraging members of the local community to play a part in the rehabilitation process. </p> <p>It is a practical response to the kind of fear generated by the indiscriminate attacks on paedophiles and others triggered by the News of the World campaign last August \"naming and shaming\" released paedophiles. </p> <p>The circles usually consist of between four and six people. A covenant is drawn up among all the members of the circle, detailing their expectations and what happens if they are broken. The \"core member\" (the sex offender) must state that he is committed to \"no more victims of sexual abuse\". </p> <p>Knowing Darren would need support when he left the Wolvercote this month, Findlater decided to set up a pilot scheme himself. \"I'm an impatient sort, and I wanted to see something live and kicking,\" he said. </p> <p>He began by phoning three or four church leaders he knew in the area where Darren was going to live. \"I told them I'd got this crazy idea about how the church could help sex offenders live safely in their community, and what did they think?\" </p> <p>He then introduced the idea to a wider group of their contacts. \"They were very positive about the concept, but remarkably pessimistic about finding volunteers with that much time to commit.\" </p> <p>In the first few weeks the core member meets the group every week and talks to at least one member every day. The circle may continue for one, two or three years, though members may change. </p> <p>Volunteers do not need social work or counselling experience. \"We wanted people who had a life, and were willing to share that life,\" said Mr Findlater. \"It helps if they are wise, and a bit cautious, people with their feet on the ground, not too prurient, and not easily shocked. It's not a mind-delving exercise. It's befriending.\" </p> <p>In October he went to see for himself the Canadian scheme working. He and the coordinator in Toronto spent a day out at Niagara Falls with a former sex offender. Later they all dropped in to see the coordinator's sister, then went on to eat pizza at a party. </p> <p>\"It's not about giving them a bit of your time, it's more about doing things together whether playing computer games, table tennis, or going for a walk. Sometimes this creates community that the core member may never have had before.\" </p> <p>He says he approached church people to help find volunteers because of the Christian belief in the value of every human being, and that everyone could be encouraged to make a constructive contribution. But he is absolutely clear that joining a circle is not an evangelistic activity. </p> <p>\"We don't want people coming along with the aim of saving someone's soul. Not because I don't believe it, but I don't think it's a helpful starting point. Instead, it's closer to the words of Jesus: 'I was in prison, and you visited me'.\" </p> <p>He also reckons the churches have a lot to learn. \"They need to exercise more caution, and open their eyes a bit wider. There's evidence that church communities contain a higher rate of sex offenders than the community as a whole. I hope a bi-product of this might be more vigilance in their own communities.\" In the future, he says he would welcome volunteers of all faiths as well as non-believers. </p> <p>Four volunteers between 35 and 50 emerged for Darren's circle: Mr Findlater himself, a quantity surveyor, a community worker and a church minister. Five detailed training sessions covered the legal and social context, and information about the behaviour of sex offenders. They also covered the purpose and aims of developing a personal plan for the core member to prevent re-offending, and a background briefing on Darren himself. </p> <p>The female member of the group decided to meet Darren only in public places, not at her home. There was also the question of who they could share their involvement with. One said sadly that they felt at present, given the feeling against paedophiles, they couldn't tell anyone at all, outside close family. \"It is sad,\" said Mr Findlater, \"but I hope over time that will change.\" </p> <p>Out of the recent church hall meeting, Darren's group has come to a framework agreement. In pursuit of the goal of not re-offending, Darren has now committed himself to meeting circle members regularly, not drinking, and keeping any appointments made on his behalf with the probation service or the local drugs and alcohol agency. He has also agreed to continue efforts to get work. In return, the other members of the circle have agreed to give him regular and sustained support. </p> <p>If Darren starts breaking the agreement, the group will discuss this with him at an emergency meeting. If a problem continues, the circle will inform the local sex offender registration police office or other statutory agency. The circle's job is not supervision: it is to help supervision through close contact. </p> <p>Warning signs could include starting to drink, missing appointments, stopping shaving or bathing, using inappropriate language, or showing signs of depression or withdrawal. </p> <p>In Canada, some agreements have been broken. But early evidence shows a reduction in re-offending. For those high-risk offenders who have been in one of the 30 circles of support in Canada over a two-year period, the re-offending rate so far is down to 10%. That's compared with the usual level of 21.5%. </p> <p>The Society of Friends last month hosted a second follow-up meeting with representatives of the Home Office and other agencies. The Home Office is believed now to be considering setting aside some funding for further pilots under the programme of its dangerous offenders' unit. In the meantime, a partnership of Thames Valley Police, the Society of Friends, and the Ox-Bucks Probation Service is pursuing whether some government funding for restorative justice work with adults might be available for a pilot along circle lines beginning next spring. </p> <p>\"There is real interest in developing other pilots,\" said Helen Drewery, secretary of the Quaker crime and community justice committee. \"But everyone's a bit twitchy. One worry is the fear of what happens if a high-profile case were to go horribly wrong, and discredit the idea. But everything has some risks. Wearing a car seat belt might trap you in a fire but that's no reason not to wear one. And on the Canadian evidence, something is more likely to go horribly wrong without a circle of support.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "It's Saturday night in a church hall. But this is no youth club dance. Nor is it a typical church meeting. Instead, five people are quietly meeting to help a paedophile reintegrate into the community. This is the first British meeting of a \"circle of support and accountability\". Together, the members of the circle are working out a mutual agreement which will reduce risk - risk to the community, risk to his victims and risk to himself. The circle model has worked successfully in Canada for six years.If this new model works here too, it could radically improve the care and supervision on release of some of the more dangerous of Britain's 100,000-plus convicted sex offenders. Darren (not his real name) is 36. A former alcoholic, over 20 years he has collected a number of convictions for indecently assaulting adolescent females and young adult women. After six months in prison for sexual abuse, he underwent 15 months' intensive therapy at Wolvercote clinic in Epsom, Surrey, which focuses on reducing abuse by assessing and treating sex offenders. His time at the clinic ended last month. Donald Findlater, clinic manager at Wolvercote, regularly sees men leave the clinic or prison who are going out to nobody. \"Their former family and friends - if they ever had any - may well have fallen by the wayside,\" he said. \"Without a job, or other support, some end up sleeping in night shelters, living on the streets, and returning to drink.\" Many of those obliged by the terms of their release from prison to keep in contact with the hard-pressed probation service may have only very limited contact - weekly meetings initially, reducing to monthly meetings after a relatively short period. Findlater reckoned there must be a better way to reduce the risk of re-offending. Last June, he attended a workshop run by the Religious Society of Friends in Britain, the Quakers. Five Canadians addressed representatives from the Home Office, police, probation services, church groups and charities. The Canadians described a new scheme set up to deal with similar problems in Canada. Backed by the Mennonite Church and founded in Ontario, the scheme offers support for offenders with no one else to turn to, and tries to reassure public fears by encouraging members of the local community to play a part in the rehabilitation process. It is a practical response to the kind of fear generated by the indiscriminate attacks on paedophiles and others triggered by the News of the World campaign last August \"naming and shaming\" released paedophiles. The circles usually consist of between four and six people. A covenant is drawn up among all the members of the circle, detailing their expectations and what happens if they are broken. The \"core member\" (the sex offender) must state that he is committed to \"no more victims of sexual abuse\". Knowing Darren would need support when he left the Wolvercote this month, Findlater decided to set up a pilot scheme himself. \"I'm an impatient sort, and I wanted to see something live and kicking,\" he said. He began by phoning three or four church leaders he knew in the area where Darren was going to live. \"I told them I'd got this crazy idea about how the church could help sex offenders live safely in their community, and what did they think?\" He then introduced the idea to a wider group of their contacts. \"They were very positive about the concept, but remarkably pessimistic about finding volunteers with that much time to commit.\" In the first few weeks the core member meets the group every week and talks to at least one member every day. The circle may continue for one, two or three years, though members may change. Volunteers do not need social work or counselling experience. \"We wanted people who had a life, and were willing to share that life,\" said Mr Findlater. \"It helps if they are wise, and a bit cautious, people with their feet on the ground, not too prurient, and not easily shocked. It's not a mind-delving exercise. It's befriending.\" In October he went to see for himself the Canadian scheme working. He and the coordinator in Toronto spent a day out at Niagara Falls with a former sex offender. Later they all dropped in to see the coordinator's sister, then went on to eat pizza at a party. \"It's not about giving them a bit of your time, it's more about doing things together whether playing computer games, table tennis, or going for a walk. Sometimes this creates community that the core member may never have had before.\" He says he approached church people to help find volunteers because of the Christian belief in the value of every human being, and that everyone could be encouraged to make a constructive contribution. But he is absolutely clear that joining a circle is not an evangelistic activity. \"We don't want people coming along with the aim of saving someone's soul. Not because I don't believe it, but I don't think it's a helpful starting point. Instead, it's closer to the words of Jesus: 'I was in prison, and you visited me'.\" He also reckons the churches have a lot to learn. \"They need to exercise more caution, and open their eyes a bit wider. There's evidence that church communities contain a higher rate of sex offenders than the community as a whole. I hope a bi-product of this might be more vigilance in their own communities.\" In the future, he says he would welcome volunteers of all faiths as well as non-believers. Four volunteers between 35 and 50 emerged for Darren's circle: Mr Findlater himself, a quantity surveyor, a community worker and a church minister. Five detailed training sessions covered the legal and social context, and information about the behaviour of sex offenders. They also covered the purpose and aims of developing a personal plan for the core member to prevent re-offending, and a background briefing on Darren himself. The female member of the group decided to meet Darren only in public places, not at her home. There was also the question of who they could share their involvement with. One said sadly that they felt at present, given the feeling against paedophiles, they couldn't tell anyone at all, outside close family. \"It is sad,\" said Mr Findlater, \"but I hope over time that will change.\" Out of the recent church hall meeting, Darren's group has come to a framework agreement. In pursuit of the goal of not re-offending, Darren has now committed himself to meeting circle members regularly, not drinking, and keeping any appointments made on his behalf with the probation service or the local drugs and alcohol agency. He has also agreed to continue efforts to get work. In return, the other members of the circle have agreed to give him regular and sustained support. If Darren starts breaking the agreement, the group will discuss this with him at an emergency meeting. If a problem continues, the circle will inform the local sex offender registration police office or other statutory agency. The circle's job is not supervision: it is to help supervision through close contact. Warning signs could include starting to drink, missing appointments, stopping shaving or bathing, using inappropriate language, or showing signs of depression or withdrawal. In Canada, some agreements have been broken. But early evidence shows a reduction in re-offending. For those high-risk offenders who have been in one of the 30 circles of support in Canada over a two-year period, the re-offending rate so far is down to 10%. That's compared with the usual level of 21.5%. The Society of Friends last month hosted a second follow-up meeting with representatives of the Home Office and other agencies. The Home Office is believed now to be considering setting aside some funding for further pilots under the programme of its dangerous offenders' unit. In the meantime, a partnership of Thames Valley Police, the Society of Friends, and the Ox-Bucks Probation Service is pursuing whether some government funding for restorative justice work with adults might be available for a pilot along circle lines beginning next spring. \"There is real interest in developing other pilots,\" said Helen Drewery, secretary of the Quaker crime and community justice committee. \"But everyone's a bit twitchy. One worry is the fear of what happens if a high-profile case were to go horribly wrong, and discredit the idea. But everything has some risks. Wearing a car seat belt might trap you in a fire but that's no reason not to wear one. And on the Canadian evidence, something is more likely to go horribly wrong without a circle of support.\"",

      "body": "<p>'We cannot do business like this in the future,\" said a bleary-eyed Tony Blair after the final day of the European Union summit in Nice turned into a protracted all-night vigil, which had television reporters flat on their backs with anticipation. </p> <p>European negotiations are notoriously bureaucratic and this one appears to have broken a few records. But staying up all night to clinch a deal is an increasingly common business practice, although few of the people who routinely do all-nighters think they are a good idea, or even strictly necessary. </p> <p>Most of us first experienced the all-nighter as students, as the end product of some seriously flawed time management. We persuaded ourselves that the small hours were an untapped resource: while the world slept we would stay up to write that history essay in one intense burst of pure concentration, and use whatever time was left over to read Little Dorrit. The shortcomings of this system were only too apparent. </p> <p>The work itself suffered from impaired decision-making - why shouldn't a lab report be written in rhyming couplets? - and the knock-on effect of exhaustion compromised one's schedule further. </p> <p>We put our student days behind us, only to discover that much of the adult world still works that way. All-nighters occur in any profession that operates on strict deadlines. </p> <p>It is a fairly common occupational hazard for journalists, and many of us who work from home budget our time now no better than we did when we were 19. Computer geeks without social lives to sacrifice will happily beaver away all night with nothing but a free Chinese takeaway as an incentive. </p> <p>Corporate transactions are often negotiated against the clock, through the night, because one side or another is keen to wrap things up before the end of the tax year. Complex contract negotiations require huge amounts of documentation, forcing teams of people to stay up all night just assembling paperwork. </p> <p>And legal deadlines clearly have a way of sneaking up on lawyers. It is safe to assume that the respective legal teams of Al Gore and George W Bush have had very little sleep over the past few days. </p> <p>Although no one actually likes them, all-nighters can be grimly satisfying, giving you the feeling that you are going the extra mile, exhausting every avenue, working under extraordinary circumstances to achieve the impossible, to salvage a lost cause, to pull a rabbit out of a hat. </p> <p>This is, of course largely an illusion, or perhaps more accurately, a hallucination, brought on by severe sleep deprivation. </p> <p>In reality the all-nighter is usually an anarchic mess, fuelled by junk food and caffeine, and constantly on the verge of breaking down. As people get tired they become more intractable, their attention spans shorten and their brains turn to jelly.

      "bodyText": "'We cannot do business like this in the future,\" said a bleary-eyed Tony Blair after the final day of the European Union summit in Nice turned into a protracted all-night vigil, which had television reporters flat on their backs with anticipation. European negotiations are notoriously bureaucratic and this one appears to have broken a few records. But staying up all night to clinch a deal is an increasingly common business practice, although few of the people who routinely do all-nighters think they are a good idea, or even strictly necessary. Most of us first experienced the all-nighter as students, as the end product of some seriously flawed time management. We persuaded ourselves that the small hours were an untapped resource: while the world slept we would stay up to write that history essay in one intense burst of pure concentration, and use whatever time was left over to read Little Dorrit. The shortcomings of this system were only too apparent. The work itself suffered from impaired decision-making - why shouldn't a lab report be written in rhyming couplets? - and the knock-on effect of exhaustion compromised one's schedule further. We put our student days behind us, only to discover that much of the adult world still works that way. All-nighters occur in any profession that operates on strict deadlines. It is a fairly common occupational hazard for journalists, and many of us who work from home budget our time now no better than we did when we were 19. Computer geeks without social lives to sacrifice will happily beaver away all night with nothing but a free Chinese takeaway as an incentive. Corporate transactions are often negotiated against the clock, through the night, because one side or another is keen to wrap things up before the end of the tax year. Complex contract negotiations require huge amounts of documentation, forcing teams of people to stay up all night just assembling paperwork. And legal deadlines clearly have a way of sneaking up on lawyers. It is safe to assume that the respective legal teams of Al Gore and George W Bush have had very little sleep over the past few days. Although no one actually likes them, all-nighters can be grimly satisfying, giving you the feeling that you are going the extra mile, exhausting every avenue, working under extraordinary circumstances to achieve the impossible, to salvage a lost cause, to pull a rabbit out of a hat. This is, of course largely an illusion, or perhaps more accurately, a hallucination, brought on by severe sleep deprivation. In reality the all-nighter is usually an anarchic mess, fuelled by junk food and caffeine, and constantly on the verge of breaking down. As people get tired they become more intractable, their attention spans shorten and their brains turn to jelly. In the middle of the night it takes hours to achieve what you could have got done in minutes the previous afternoon. In fact no matter how much of a high-flier you are, all the familiar drawbacks of the student all-nighter still apply: nobody performs particularly well at four in the morning, and nobody who stays up all night is at their best the next day.
