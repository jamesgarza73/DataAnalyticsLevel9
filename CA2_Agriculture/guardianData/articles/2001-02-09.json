      "bodyText": "Eighty professional footballers are to have their passports examined by police specialising in immigration fraud in the first crackdown on the use of allegedly bogus European nationality papers by foreign players in England. Concern is mounting across Europe and within the game's governing bodies Fifa and Uefa about the number of players born outside the continent holding European Union passports, allowing them to play without work permits. Major investigations are under way in Italy, Spain and France but little action has been taken by English football officials, who fear that the problem here is growing and that many foreign players are illegally obtaining passports using false documents. Of the 80 English-based footballers who hold dual nationality, 21 are with Premier League clubs. They will all be asked to submit their passports for examination and produce evidence that they have the right to hold them. Police officials will also check if the passports are fakes or not. Most of the players come from South America and qualify for European passports because of grandparents born within the continent. In November 1999 Derby County's Argentine forward Esteban Fuertes was refused admission to Britain after a club trip to Portugal after his Italian passport was found to be forged. Likewise, Arsenal's Brazilian defensive midfielder Edu was barred from entry last July because his Portuguese passport was counterfeit, although he has since returned with a valid document. The sports minister Kate Hoey, representatives of the Home Office and football officials are to meet with the police's National Criminal Intelligence Service next week, which has a department specialising in international immigration fraud. NCIS officials working with the Home Office immigration department will examine the authenticity of European passports held by those players born outside the EU as part of a coordinated approach to the problem. Football officials and the government fear that organised crime may be involved in selling illegal passports to footballers across Europe. According to some reports, the Russian mafia has been responsible for selling Greek passports to non-European footballers. The NCIS was initially approached by Hoey following concerns that not enough was being done to combat the use of illegal passports and that an organisation that specialises in organised crime was needed to investigate the issue. An NCIS spokesman said: \"We have been approached to provide assistance and are willing to give any assistance that we can.\" Hoey said: \"Everybody who cares about the game and the integrity of football must be concerned at these allegations. These talks [next week] should enable us all to work out a coordinated approach to what is a Europe-wide problem.\" Bryan Drew, head of strategic and specialist intelligence at the NCIS, will represent the organisation at next week's meeting. The NCIS investigation will also attempt to examine whether clubs have been involved in helping some of their players obtain false papers for European passports. If any cases are proved then guilty clubs could be docked points or thrown out of cup competitions in which footballers with illegal documentation have played. The FA said last night that the chief executive Adam Crozier was to attend a Fifa meeting next week to discuss the issue of false documentation and footballers. Gordon Taylor, head of the Professional Footballers Association, will also be at next week's meeting and last night welcomed plans by the NCIS to examine the authenticity of the 80 passports held by non-European England-based players. Taylor has spoken to Hoey and claims that what is occurring in Italy, Spain and France with illegal passports is also happening in England. Taylor said: \"It's very important that NCIS gets involved. There are only 80 passports that will need checking and I cannot imagine that it will be that difficult. \"I cannot believe that of the 80 footballers with two passports there are no suspect cases. Football clubs must also be investigated to see if they have been involved in helping secure illegal passports for their players.\"",

      "body": "<p>Another week in Malaysia full of varied activity - including a lot more body piercing... </p> <p> On Friday evening, Bruce and I smartened ourselves up to go to a concert in KL with Feliz. This was the third outing for my one dress. I even used Feliz's local knowledge to have an overdue haircut, an experience that included a 15 minute vigorous head massage that left the scalp tingling - if somewhat sore. It was an interesting evening with an audience of mixed ages and ethnic backgrounds. I met a local writer, an artist and a film producer or two. The music was good with Feliz's friend Mike from Texas singing and playing a mean piano; there were also two very good local singer/songwriters on guitar. A plentiful supply of wine added to a very enjoyable evening, and when we got back Feliz showed me the Radio Four website, where you can catch the Archers live, if you're prepared to wait until three in the morning. So after only three hours sleep, it was up bright and early to head off for Taman Negara National Park. It was also goodbye to Feliz who has been a brilliant host - she faces an uncertain future, not sure if she can stay in Malaysia. Good luck Feliz, and I hope it all works out as you would wish. </p> <p> I hope you aren't all muttering 'not another rainforest' - I promise this is the last for a while. Taman Negara is the largest, the oldest and the most commercial of Malaysia's national parks. The privately owned resort is very smart and very expensive, but the other side of the river has cheap accomodation and some excellent floating restaurants. I met up with Mary, an American environmentalist, and we did the long canopy walk, swaying up among the treetops, which was good fun, and carried on for a further five hour walk. That night I found myself the only person in a block of three, five-bed dorms. This wasn't a problem until I discovered that the windows did not shut and the handle of the door was broken. On tackling the lady in charge she dismissed this saying that she was on the premises 24 hours a day. That night I slept cuddling my bag of valuables and my torch. Amazingly I woke 11 hours later from a deep dreamless sleep, missing Mary's attempt to find me for a rubber tube ride over the rapids. In the afternoon we took a wonderful boat ride down a side river with crystal clear water and a canopy of jungle, spotting many kingfishers, an eagle, huge monitor lizards and a couple of monkeys. There were lots of hornbills flying overhead but we didn't get to see one close up. </p> <p> On Tuesday I returned to KL with Mary to find accomodation. We had picked a place out of the book, but couldn't find it anywhere. The taxi driver lost patience and dumped us but we still couldn't find it on foot. In desperation we booked in to the nearest decent looking hotel which turned out to be very luxurious - and very expensive. Mary was off back to the States early next morning. I could not face the thought of moving again and leaving those fluffy white towels, hot water, TV, and very comfy bed and stayed on. A body can only take so much roughing it - economy drive next week. </p> <p> Wednesday, having sampled Chinese-style body piercing in Kuching, it seemed appropriate to go to the Hindu Thaipusam festival in KL. Hindus flock in their thousands to the Batu caves to celebrate the festival in honour of Lord Murugu, the six-faced god. Devotees - men, women and children dressed in saffron, often with their heads shaved, carrying jars of milk and limes - queue to go up the 272 steps to the temple inside the cave to offer penance, or thanks for blessings received. Most spectacular are the 'vel kavardis' - large, metal, cage-like constructions decorated with pictures of the gods and peacock feathers, carried on the shoulders of the men and attached to their bodies by metal hooks in the skin. They also have an assortment of hooks and rods through their faces and tongues. I have never seen anything like the spectacle of them all queueing to go up the steps, fired on by the constant chanting and beating of drums. I was content to watch until spotted by Jit, a young Malaysian I had met at Feliz's who persuaded me to join the procession up the steps to the temple. This meant being part of the vast human press of sweating, heaving bodies, avoiding the litter of lost sandles, empty water bottles and the occasional person who had fainted and was being carried away by the plentiful first aiders. Once on the stairway it was OK and was worth the effort to see the temple inside the huge caves. Here, the goal reached, the offerings were made and the cages removed. People were quiet, occasionally in trance or complete exhaustion, some enjoying the irreverent monkeys leaping on the many statues high in the walls. The whole morning was a memorable and exciting experience, marred only by the personal moments of near panic when the crowd started pushing. Back down again I felt exhausted, had had enough and headed back to KL. </p> <p> A very late lunch, a few iced drinks and I felt revived enough to visit Central Market, full of local art work and touristy gifts. Here there was a festival of fortune telling and, in a manner reminiscent of being henna'd in India, I somehow found myself in the booth of MD. Har Chao Wah, a woman specialising in geomancy and palmistry. Here we go - I was born in the year of the ox and am metal, which means I lack water, I am therefore not very good at looking after my inner self and spend all my money. This and other bits relating to my character and past were pretty accurate. 1998, 99 and 2000 were not good years (I would dispute 2000) and Aug, Sept and Dec are my best months. I will find love, happiness and money from 2003 onward. She ignored my request that it be a bit sooner, please. I get easily tired, will have trouble with my heart or breathing, should eat more fruit and veg, need to put on a bit of weight but will live into my 80's. I am creative and should try writing. Well - not bad, I suppose. I will leave it to you to deduce how much she could guess by the fact that I was wandering about on my own, was very tired from the morning at the festival, had a quick ciggie before I went in, do not have a wedding ring and chose the cheapest option available.

      "bodyText": "Another week in Malaysia full of varied activity - including a lot more body piercing... On Friday evening, Bruce and I smartened ourselves up to go to a concert in KL with Feliz. This was the third outing for my one dress. I even used Feliz's local knowledge to have an overdue haircut, an experience that included a 15 minute vigorous head massage that left the scalp tingling - if somewhat sore. It was an interesting evening with an audience of mixed ages and ethnic backgrounds. I met a local writer, an artist and a film producer or two. The music was good with Feliz's friend Mike from Texas singing and playing a mean piano; there were also two very good local singer/songwriters on guitar. A plentiful supply of wine added to a very enjoyable evening, and when we got back Feliz showed me the Radio Four website, where you can catch the Archers live, if you're prepared to wait until three in the morning. So after only three hours sleep, it was up bright and early to head off for Taman Negara National Park. It was also goodbye to Feliz who has been a brilliant host - she faces an uncertain future, not sure if she can stay in Malaysia. Good luck Feliz, and I hope it all works out as you would wish. I hope you aren't all muttering 'not another rainforest' - I promise this is the last for a while. Taman Negara is the largest, the oldest and the most commercial of Malaysia's national parks. The privately owned resort is very smart and very expensive, but the other side of the river has cheap accomodation and some excellent floating restaurants. I met up with Mary, an American environmentalist, and we did the long canopy walk, swaying up among the treetops, which was good fun, and carried on for a further five hour walk. That night I found myself the only person in a block of three, five-bed dorms. This wasn't a problem until I discovered that the windows did not shut and the handle of the door was broken. On tackling the lady in charge she dismissed this saying that she was on the premises 24 hours a day. That night I slept cuddling my bag of valuables and my torch. Amazingly I woke 11 hours later from a deep dreamless sleep, missing Mary's attempt to find me for a rubber tube ride over the rapids. In the afternoon we took a wonderful boat ride down a side river with crystal clear water and a canopy of jungle, spotting many kingfishers, an eagle, huge monitor lizards and a couple of monkeys. There were lots of hornbills flying overhead but we didn't get to see one close up. On Tuesday I returned to KL with Mary to find accomodation. We had picked a place out of the book, but couldn't find it anywhere. The taxi driver lost patience and dumped us but we still couldn't find it on foot. In desperation we booked in to the nearest decent looking hotel which turned out to be very luxurious - and very expensive. Mary was off back to the States early next morning. I could not face the thought of moving again and leaving those fluffy white towels, hot water, TV, and very comfy bed and stayed on. A body can only take so much roughing it - economy drive next week. Wednesday, having sampled Chinese-style body piercing in Kuching, it seemed appropriate to go to the Hindu Thaipusam festival in KL. Hindus flock in their thousands to the Batu caves to celebrate the festival in honour of Lord Murugu, the six-faced god. Devotees - men, women and children dressed in saffron, often with their heads shaved, carrying jars of milk and limes - queue to go up the 272 steps to the temple inside the cave to offer penance, or thanks for blessings received. Most spectacular are the 'vel kavardis' - large, metal, cage-like constructions decorated with pictures of the gods and peacock feathers, carried on the shoulders of the men and attached to their bodies by metal hooks in the skin. They also have an assortment of hooks and rods through their faces and tongues. I have never seen anything like the spectacle of them all queueing to go up the steps, fired on by the constant chanting and beating of drums. I was content to watch until spotted by Jit, a young Malaysian I had met at Feliz's who persuaded me to join the procession up the steps to the temple. This meant being part of the vast human press of sweating, heaving bodies, avoiding the litter of lost sandles, empty water bottles and the occasional person who had fainted and was being carried away by the plentiful first aiders. Once on the stairway it was OK and was worth the effort to see the temple inside the huge caves. Here, the goal reached, the offerings were made and the cages removed. People were quiet, occasionally in trance or complete exhaustion, some enjoying the irreverent monkeys leaping on the many statues high in the walls. The whole morning was a memorable and exciting experience, marred only by the personal moments of near panic when the crowd started pushing. Back down again I felt exhausted, had had enough and headed back to KL. A very late lunch, a few iced drinks and I felt revived enough to visit Central Market, full of local art work and touristy gifts. Here there was a festival of fortune telling and, in a manner reminiscent of being henna'd in India, I somehow found myself in the booth of MD. Har Chao Wah, a woman specialising in geomancy and palmistry. Here we go - I was born in the year of the ox and am metal, which means I lack water, I am therefore not very good at looking after my inner self and spend all my money. This and other bits relating to my character and past were pretty accurate. 1998, 99 and 2000 were not good years (I would dispute 2000) and Aug, Sept and Dec are my best months. I will find love, happiness and money from 2003 onward. She ignored my request that it be a bit sooner, please. I get easily tired, will have trouble with my heart or breathing, should eat more fruit and veg, need to put on a bit of weight but will live into my 80's. I am creative and should try writing. Well - not bad, I suppose. I will leave it to you to deduce how much she could guess by the fact that I was wandering about on my own, was very tired from the morning at the festival, had a quick ciggie before I went in, do not have a wedding ring and chose the cheapest option available. Having just started to read Tiziano Terzani's A Fortune Teller Told Me, I am only relieved that she didn't tell me that I shouldn't fly. The next day I decided to take all the email advice and try a little island/beach life and set off to Pulau Pangkot.

Since we arrived I have twice bumped into a Canadian couple I'd already met on the bus, once to eat a delicious Indonesian meal. When I have finished this I might hire a bike and explore.

      "body": "<p>This week I discovered a beautiful part of Sydney which seems much overlooked. In the late afternoon, Brian and I hopped on ferry to Taronga Zoo. Ignoring the dubious delights of the zoo itself we instead headed along a coastal path to Bradley's Head. The walk was beautiful, with some of the few remaining bits of natural bushland in Sydney. </p> <p>I was delighted to be back among red gum trees and parrots, though out encounter with several large hairy spiders wasn't so enjoyable. It seemed strange to me how no-one else was walking through this natural zoo, with its fantastic views over the harbour where the bridge and opera house were clearly visible through the grey haze. If you're headed that way, take an extra hour to explore this scenic area. </p> <p>On Friday I finally got round to getting a medicard - which my flatmates had been nagging me to do for a while. It means you can see a doctor for free and they say it's one of the first things a traveller should do on arriving in Australia. </p> <p>My attempts to go to the beach in the afternoon were thwarted by heavy rain - and not for the first time in these last few weeks - grrrrrrr. In the evening my apartment group headed to a local place to listen to some live music. I was stunned by how quiet the venue was and we realised that at last the summer holidays were over - and Sydney was populated only by people who actually lived there. </p> <p>We went to watch a huge inter-suburb water competition at my local beach involving rowing, canoeing, and beach relay on Saturday. Although Coogee didn't do particularly well, it was impressive how few of the entrants capsized looking at the size of some of those waves. Later that afternoon I tried out a funk class at a nearby performing arts centre. It was a lot of fun, as we were a large group of beginners basically all out for some exercise combined with enjoyment - and I definitely enjoyed the feeling of freedom that you get with dancing. </p> <p>That evening myself and Brian went to the fantastically tacky Miss Coogee Bay - a competition in the style of Miss World. The main point seemed to be to have girls in their swimsuits for as long as possible while avoiding hearing them talk. When asked what she'd do with one wish, a contestant actually replied \"cure all world poverty and hunger'. Through modelling perhaps?! Still it made for an entertaining evening, as long as it wasn't taken seriously. </p> <p>Later that night, I was using the phone box which is literally just outside my apartment. I became aware that a guy had perched extremely close by so I turned to see why. It was then I noticed that he had started doing something that, let's just say, is not normal or decent for a guy to do in public, with the deliberate intention that I'd see. I cut short my call and ran back, with him calling lewd things. At least I was close to home. My advice to lone female travellers is be careful. There's no reason why girls shouldn't travel alone - in fact, I'd recommend it, but be aware that there are a few odd people around so don't put yourself in situations where you would be vulnerable. Just keep a bit of common sense and awareness. </p> <p>The next day I headed to Darling Harbour to watch a succession of Dragon Boat races in the morning, then went to the calm of the Botanical Gardens for a peaceful afternoon by myself and a good read. Besides, tomorrow I had to work - Monday mornings have taken back their old meaning for me! My second day at the hotel was no less stressful than the first. The same group of us were given yet another tour - and the hotel is such a maze we needed it - before an afternoon of very simple work. Basically we had to set things up, take things down . . and eat a lot. None of which seemed particularly taxing especially as it's such a nice group that I'm with. Afterwards we all headed to the pub, and it was good to meet a whole new group of travellers and share each other's experiences so far. Everybody has different situations - there was one couple who were struggling just to buy dinner every night, and there was French guy who told me about some of the ridiculous arguments he'd had with his girlfriend. All travelling couples I've met seem to argue, maybe due to the intensity of it - his argument had centred around whether or not he was going to eat some of her cookie! </p> <p>On Tuesday, Michaela moved out of my room and Brian moved in. Ever since I moved in Michaela has been getting increasingly excited and nervous about the arrival of her girlfriend on Wednesday who she's not seen for six months. I've got a lot of sympathy for that and hope everything goes well for them. </p> <p>In the afternoon I headed to Newtown, an area I'd not been through before. It was an interesting and funky suburb with individual shops called things like Chocolate Dog caf\u00e9 and Blue Turtle studios. Even the residents looked interesting. In the evening I rejoined the group from the hostel to enter a quiz at a local pub which, despite our best intentions to lose, we came in third. It didn't help that we argued over every question. </p> <p> On Wednesday, despite having had no intentions to go there, I found myself at Star City Casino in the early afternoon. I couldn't believe how packed the place was at such an obscure time of day - I was reliably informed however that 4am is their busiest time. Deciding I had to play something now I was there, I tried to change 20c for a bizarre card computer game. The cashier informed me, and I'm sure she was trying not to laugh, that the smallest amount you can bet is $1. I was feeling reckless so I thought I'd try the whole dollar - and was rewarded by a further dollar win. I thought I'd better end my gambling career there and then as I'd found the game unsettlingly addictive. </p> <p>Later that evening me and Brian returned to the casino area for my long-promised stab at karaoke. It's something I've never been brave enough to try before but I thought nobody will know me the other side of the world! The upshot was, I got roped into singing the Kylie and Jason classic Especially for you with a Scottish guy. I thought we were superb - we didn't just sing, we put our heart and soul into that performance. Everybody told us we were terrible (just jealousy I'm sure), but it gave me the confidence to get up on my own - after which I achieved the dizzying heights of a \"fairly poor\" performance! Still, it was a brilliantly enjoyable evening with the only downside that I returned to Coogee at 2.30 - and I start work four hours later at 6.30am! Something tells me this isn't going to be such an easy day's work - I just hope I can stay awake through it. . . Until next week (when I'll be enjoying some lovely early morning shifts) <br>Milly</p>",

But Mr Blair did something more. He dared attempt a task which he has usually ducked in his first four years in office. He offered a vision of what Labour stands for.</p> <p>Of course this was not a lofty lecture in philosophy. It was a campaign event: the time and place took care of that. Just three months away from a probable election day, Mr Blair chose Enfield, site of New Labour's most totemic victory: the May 1997 defeat of Michael Portillo. In that spirit, Mr Blair used the occasion, as so often, to recite a laundry list of Labour achievements since taking power. It may be a tedious tactic but, as the election approaches, it is a necessary one: the government has a good record in key areas - from the improved literacy and numeracy of our 11-year-olds to the creation of the minimum wage - and the prime minister is right to shout about it.</p> <p>What was less predictable was the rest of the address. Mr Blair broke the usual conventions of his trade - which couch such matters in euphemism - to make an explicit admission of his political story so far. He confessed that his first term was \"essentially one of reassurance\", as Labour calmed the nerves of those who had always doubted its ability to govern. In a second term, he promised, Labour would do more than prove its competence, be more than mere technocrats (a tacit admission from the prime minister that this is how his team has too often behaved until now). Labour would set about advancing its ideals - the lowering of the barriers that keep talent and ambition blocked and their replacement with a true meritocracy.</p> <p>It may not sound like much, but it's more substantial than the third way vapidities that have gone before. The Labour leader has at last done more than merely eschew the party's traditional conception of equality; he has offered one of his own - the pursuit of \"real upward mobility\". Mr Blair did not leave that as a mere platitude. His speech yesterday offered a specific policy aimed at creating a meritocracy: the opening up of higher education.</p> <p>Of course there is a ripe charge of hypocrisy here, given that it is Labour's abolition of maintenance grants for low income students which has done so much to keep the badly off away from our universities. But the goal, articulated yesterday, of 50% enrolment in higher education by 2010 is not only laudable, but necessary if Britain is to \"break down the barriers\" that hold its people back.</p> <p>There is something here to cheer Labour's traditional supporters. For when Mr Blair tells pupils from the toughest inner city schools that their \"background shouldn't hold [them] back\", he is speaking about more than education policy. He is attacking privilege and advancing a meritocratic brand of egalitarianism. His is not a Darwinian notion of meritocracy, that awards the the spoils only to \"the fittest\", but one that would allow people a second, third and fourth chance to compete throughout their lives. Government would have a clear role: not standing back, but making sure the race of life is run fairly. It is not perfect; it is not even complete. But the vision Tony Blair sketched yesterday opens up a space for progressives to fill with ideas of their own. It is a tantalising glimpse of what a second Labour term could bring - and why it is still worth fighting for.</p>",

It may not sound like much, but it's more substantial than the third way vapidities that have gone before. The Labour leader has at last done more than merely eschew the party's traditional conception of equality; he has offered one of his own - the pursuit of \"real upward mobility\". Mr Blair did not leave that as a mere platitude. His speech yesterday offered a specific policy aimed at creating a meritocracy: the opening up of higher education. Of course there is a ripe charge of hypocrisy here, given that it is Labour's abolition of maintenance grants for low income students which has done so much to keep the badly off away from our universities. But the goal, articulated yesterday, of 50% enrolment in higher education by 2010 is not only laudable, but necessary if Britain is to \"break down the barriers\" that hold its people back. There is something here to cheer Labour's traditional supporters. For when Mr Blair tells pupils from the toughest inner city schools that their \"background shouldn't hold [them] back\", he is speaking about more than education policy. He is attacking privilege and advancing a meritocratic brand of egalitarianism. His is not a Darwinian notion of meritocracy, that awards the the spoils only to \"the fittest\", but one that would allow people a second, third and fourth chance to compete throughout their lives. Government would have a clear role: not standing back, but making sure the race of life is run fairly. It is not perfect; it is not even complete. But the vision Tony Blair sketched yesterday opens up a space for progressives to fill with ideas of their own. It is a tantalising glimpse of what a second Labour term could bring - and why it is still worth fighting for.",

Suddenly you hear a roar building behind you: a little biplane shoots overhead, throwing loops in the bright blue sky, showing off. You watch it, amazed. A couple of local kids tumble up and stare at it, then stare at you as if your nose is green. Three scraggy dogs follow them, barking maniacally. The noisy scene fills you with the desire to throw your head back and laugh at its absurdity, laugh until your stomach is stiff. </p> <p>Picture that, and you'll have a small idea of the joy waiting for you in NoahJohn's second album. The scenes it calls to mind vary: sometimes it's lying lazily in a hammock on the porch watching your 13-year-old brother chase chickens round the yard on a Harley Davidson; or else walking home, profoundly drunk, singing to the stars while people in pyjamas throw false teeth and bedside lamps at you to try and shut you up. Whatever the image, the atmosphere is the same, caught between warm fuzziness and sparking, scrawling, spiralling bursts of energy. A frenzied calm, a placid raucousness: that's this album. </p> <p>Its reeling character comes from the collision of two very distinct musics: old-fashioned country and New York-style rock. There's a prosaic autobiographical reason behind this unholy marriage: 26-year-old frontman Carl Gustav Johns's own emigration from the family farm in Indiana to the chattering, clattering metropolis of Madison, Wisconsin. You can scoff, but anywhere with more houses than pick-up trucks is bound to make a boy from hicksville sporting a ridiculous moustache feel like picking up his guitar and wringing elation from every note. </p> <p>NoahJohn brings Johns together with four Madison musicians whom he could have met busking on the street or lying face down in a bar at midnight - no one really knows. They are the Velvet Underground gatecrashing a hoe-down and making merry with the local jug band; they're Lambchop slumming with the punks in CBGBs. It shouldn't make a bit of sense, but the two musics invigorate each other, bring a zingy freshness to any potential cliches. The conventional hillbilly tunes - Porter, Infirmary - stomp that much more vigorously; even the gentler, reflective songs - Had a Burning, Sister's Recital - can't resist ruffling the velvety surface to create a texture more abrasive and disordered. </p> <p>And the boisterous punk-injected songs - Surefire Woman, Wounded Rabbit, Ima Clam - are completely, consistently exhilarating. Wounded Rabbit begins innocuously enough, with one simple repeated chord. But then the drum bangs in and so does Stephen Burke's lap steel, careering wildly and arhythmically over the surface, closely followed by Eena Ballard's scraping viola. This exhilarating chaos is like watching a naughty child sliding down a muddy hill and itching to jump down after him. Listening to Ima Clam, you stop itching and leap. It's the whizzing guitar chords punching their way into the song at random intervals: their eccentricity is infectious. </p> <p>Even as the music has you bouncing rapturously, the lyrics make you want to sit still and pay attention - it's all part of the master plan to keep the album's elements in blissful disharmony. Like Will Oldham, Johns is at his best when he drops the chorus and tells a straight story. The narratives here are magical: as with the music, Johns presents familiar details - boys burying dead rabbits, uncles smoking Luckys, \"lightning bugs in jelly jars\" - but breathes new life into them. Sister's Recital, for instance, is narrated by a 10-year-old boy who, while his sister is playing at the school concert, discovers a window to a basement where other girls strip out of their leotards and wonders how \"I, a boy embarrassed by the word 'body' cannot look away\". It's a moment of extraordinary self-awareness, all the more affecting because it's sung with such tuneless fragility. Remarkably, Johns brings an equal emotion to the tale of Porter, the dog who gets stuck under the stove in his greedy search for heat and chicken scraps, and ends up out in the snow, dreaming of being a pup at his mother's teat again. There's no melody to Johns's voice, but it stretches across each song like a sheet of silver. </p> <p>If the album has a fault, it's the version of Loudon Wainwright III's Dead Skunk, and that's only because it reeks of novelty pop. But that's not a Johns song, so it doesn't count. What does count is that alternative country and New York punk are going to provide some of the most exciting music of this year, and NoahJohn are sat squarely between the two, offering the best of both.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair yesterday promised a total overhaul of the comprehensive school system, a huge expansion in university places and a \u00a31,000 asset gift at birth, as he unveiled the central themes of a second term Labour government. Mr Blair's speech is designed to open a swath of pre-election policy announcements, showing Labour will quickly build on what he admitted had been the slowly built foundations of the first term. The over-arching aim, he claimed, of an unprecedented second term Labour government would be to create a meritocratic society in which the barriers to upward mobility were dismantled. Mr Blair openly conceded the primary purpose in his near complete first term had been to improve the economic fundamentals and reassure voters the party would not reproduce the political and strategic errors of previous Labour governments. With this reassurance phase now over, Labour could, with a series of 10-year plans and, by implication, a third term - govern on its own terms - building a meritocratic society and breaking down the barriers to social mobility. Mr Blair made little direct reference to the Conservatives, but William Hague said that if Mr Blair was given 100 years in government he would still fail to deliver. Mr Hague insisted the real issue facing people was the preservation of the pound after Mr Blair had vowed to decide within two years of the next election whether to call for Britain to join the single currency. Mr Blair - with a 21% lead in the latest Gallup poll out today - ignored the euro in favour of his domestic agenda. \"Opening up economy and society to merit and talent is the true radical second term agenda\", he said in a speech at a school in Enfield, north London, built through the private finance initiative. He went on: \"Having defined ourselves as a party of competence and modernity, it is time for a second phase of New Labour, defined less by reference to the old Labour party, than by the agenda for the country, radical, but firmly in the centre ground.\" Mr Blair's attempt to set out a vision of an open society, likely to be put to the test of the electorate on May 3, will face the opposition challenge that similar grand visions in the 1997 election have led to disappointments. The Liberal Democrat leader, Charles Kennedy, described the speech as a clear sign of the vacuum at the heart of New Labour. \"It was a definitive speech, and the definition lacks definition.\" Mr Blair tried to pre-empt this attack by conceding that government had been more difficult than he had first imagined, and that for many people life remained a real struggle - \"uncertain , insecure and under constant pressure\". Trying to blend this humility with vision, he said: \"Though hardened by the setbacks of government, though more realistic about how long it takes to change big institutions, we remain bold in our ambitions of our country.\" Aware that Labour must assure a strong turnout from its traditional supporters to prevent a big cut in its overall majority, Mr Blair also promised his government would be more than technocrats and instead pursue the ideal of a fairer society. Returning to the theme of education on which he was first elected, Mr Blair promised a radical overhaul of the failed comprehensive system by doubling the number of specialist schools within five years, so that four in 10 secondary schools would be outside the comprehensive system. The Budget, which is likely to be on March 6, will also include extra money for schools, bringing state funding per pupil closer to that of the private sector. Although the government is keen for academic institutions to take on more students, it has been unwilling to commit more money to the sector. Apart from reform of the criminal justice system, Mr Blair also promised measures to create an American-style entrepreneurial culture, with greater competition, less regulation and an end to the stigma of bankruptcy. He will issue a white paper on building technology start-ups in universities on the US model. Mr Blair also signalled a new warmth to public sector workers, claiming he wanted to give them new powers. He wanted \"doctors, police officers and teachers to become the social entrepreneurs of the future as important as any businessman or woman.

      "body": "<p>Specialist schools were the brainchild of the previous Conservative government, but the Tories could hardly have imagined that incoming Labour ministers would not only enthusiastically embrace their project, but also extend it beyond recognition.</p> <p>Tony Blair's latest, ambitious goal is to double the number of specialist schools to 1,500 by 2006, which would mean they would then account for nearly half (46%) of all maintained secondary schools. The latest figures show that 608 secondary schools have now been designated as specialist schools, compared with just 181 in May 1997 when Labour came to power.</p> <p>Schools awarded specialist status receive extra government funding, and are allowed to select up to 10% of their intake by aptitude, which has promoted comprehensive campaigners to level charges that they are operating \"selection by the back door\".</p> <p>Although they offer the mainstream curriculum, they also provide specialist teaching in a range of subjects. Until now the specialisms have been confined to sport, arts and media, technology and music. But yesterday, following extensive lobbying by teacher unions, the government announced the addition of three new categories - engineering, science and business and enterprise.</p> <p>All maintained secondary schools are eligible to apply, except in some areas where there already are large numbers of specialist schools.

      "bodyText": "Specialist schools were the brainchild of the previous Conservative government, but the Tories could hardly have imagined that incoming Labour ministers would not only enthusiastically embrace their project, but also extend it beyond recognition. Tony Blair's latest, ambitious goal is to double the number of specialist schools to 1,500 by 2006, which would mean they would then account for nearly half (46%) of all maintained secondary schools. The latest figures show that 608 secondary schools have now been designated as specialist schools, compared with just 181 in May 1997 when Labour came to power. Schools awarded specialist status receive extra government funding, and are allowed to select up to 10% of their intake by aptitude, which has promoted comprehensive campaigners to level charges that they are operating \"selection by the back door\". Although they offer the mainstream curriculum, they also provide specialist teaching in a range of subjects. Until now the specialisms have been confined to sport, arts and media, technology and music. But yesterday, following extensive lobbying by teacher unions, the government announced the addition of three new categories - engineering, science and business and enterprise. All maintained secondary schools are eligible to apply, except in some areas where there already are large numbers of specialist schools. They must raise \u00a350,000 sponsorship from the private sector, prepare four-year development plans with measurable targets in teaching and learning in the specialist subject area, and make provision to involve other schools and the wider community. In return, successful applicants receive \u00a3100,000 capital grant and \u00a3123 per pupil per year (for the first 1,000 pupils), initially for four years. The Department for Education and Employment said yesterday that it expected the first engineering, science and business and enterprise colleges to start operating in September 2002. Specialist schools are popular and over-subscribed, not least because of mounting evidence that they out-perform their comprehensive rivals. Research by David Jesson of York University last year revealed that non-selective specialist schools had 52% of their pupils achieving five good GCSE passes at grades A to C, compared with 41% for all other state schools. Between 1994 and 1999, non-selective specialist schools improved their pass rate by 21% while other state schools went up by only 12%, although. some parents' organisations have expressed concerns about the pressure on youngsters to specialise too young. David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, warned: \"This vision cannot be delivered if an overhaul of the comprehensive system leads to a widening gap between the advantaged and the disadvantaged. Expanding specialist schools to embrace engineering, science and business and enterprise can only be achieved if the government invests a great deal more money in recruiting the teachers crucial to the delivery of such a radical approach.\" Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers said: \"The prime minister ignores reality.

BSkyB revealed a \u00a345m increase in interactive TV costs and a loss of \u00a346m from its stake in KirchPayTV when it announced its first-half results last Wednesday. Despite posting a 50% rise in losses to \u00a3112m, many analysts gave the thumbs-up to the results. West LB Panmure kept its \"buy\" recommendation, saying that the interactive Open and KirchPayTV provided long-term opportunities. Mathew Horsman at Investec Henderson Crosthwaite was also supportive, maintaining his \"buy\" assessment and saying the results were \"bang in line with expectations.\"",

A full transcript of the unedited interview found its way onto emails around the country, causing uproar at the BBC. The transcript begun appearing on the internet today and the Daily Mail has also published extracts. FHM was the first to obtain a leak and its website was among several to have posted the full script today. MediaGuardian.co.uk also ran the transcript before being ordered to pull it down by BBC lawyers. But the BBC does not believe an insider is to blame. \"Someone who watched the interview being filmed must have smuggled in a tape recorder,\" said the spokeswoman. \"We don't produce transcripts until after a show is edited.\" The no-holds-barred interview has Ali G ask a shocked David Beckham if he would rather be married to Baby Spice. But it's Sporty Spice who comes in for the most abuse. At one point Ali G asks Beckham: \"You is the best at football, ya know. \"So you get Posh. So does Sporty Spice go out with someone from Scunthorpe United?\" Later, he asks Posh whether she thought she ought to put on some weight, adding that of course she shouldn't go as far as Sporty Spice. But many of the more offensive - and funny - sections will never reach our screens. The BBC is planning to edit out references to Sporty Spice, among others. And it has set its lawyers on to anyone who tries to publish the leaked transcript. \"We're incredibly unhappy about all this,\" said a BBC spokeswoman. \"Comic Relief was planning to publish bits of the show in the run-up to the broadcast to attract people to its website, which would have brought in extra income to the charity. \"People seeing it beforehand ruins that.\"",

      "bodyText": "Public confidence in food safety has plummeted in the wake of the BSE scandal and only drastic steps can restore it, the government admitted today. In its long-awaited interim response to Lord Phillip's critical BSE report published last year, it pledged ministers will be more open in handling health scares. The agriculture minister, Nick Brown, outlined far-reaching measures to keep people better informed about future crises. \"There has been a significant loss of public confidence in the arrangements for handling food safety and standards, due in large part to the events surrounding BSE,\" said the response, which is due to be presented to parliament today. \"The government recognises that its efforts to build and sustain trust through openness cannot succeed unless it is fully prepared to acknowledge uncertainty in its assessments of risk.\" Lord Phillip's 16-volume report highlighted a desire to avoid an unjustified health scare, poor departmental communication and bureaucratic delays in responding to scientific warnings about BSE risks. Published last October, it criticised ministers and civil servants for failing to be open about the possibility of BSE spreading to humans. Today's 102-page response sets out plans to ensure lessons are learnt from the scandals and to rebuild faith in food safety. It said: \"The whole approach and behaviour of departments and individuals will need to change to ensure that the lessons identified by the inquiry are properly absorbed and implemented.\" It continued: \"A balance needs to be struck between intervening too much, forgoing benefits and stifling people's freedom of action, and failing to help protect them sufficiently from actual or potential hazards.\" But the government added that it had already taken steps to improve the situation, such as setting up the food standards agency in April 2000 and improving arrangements for other departments to communicate with the public. More than 80 people have died from vCJD, the human form of mad cow disease, and the government has agreed interim compensation for families. Today's response said BSE was \"a national tragedy\", adding that it has had \"damaging and far reaching effects.\" It focused on a number of key areas for improvement, including science and governments, and examines the way ministers obtain scientific advice and how it is used in taking policy decisions. The report also looks at openness and what the government is doing \"to generate greater public trust in its handling of food safety and related issues.\" The report added: \"The government does not believe there any serious gaps in its powers to take proportionate emergency action against hazards to human or animal health.\" But it added that, in general, the response recognises \"the need for government departments to change the way they operate, with the emphasis in securing positive changes in behaviour rather than policy, structure or machinery.\" The Consumers' Association said the EU must also learn the lessons from the Phillips inquiry.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It was the bed that really stood out. There it was, four-postered, in the middle of the Connaught ballroom in London, while Madonna, Lady Victoria Hervey and assorted double-barrelled names teetered and tittered on their Gucci stilettos, celebrating the launch of Agent Provocateur's perfume in November. </p> <p>On the bed, an improbably proportioned model writhed on the sheets. If this is how they launch a perfume, one suspects that Valentine's Day for Agent Provocateur's owners, Serena Rees and Joe Corr\u00e9, will involve more than dinner for two at the local Italian and a box of Ferrero Rocher. </p> <p>Rees and Corr\u00e9 are the acceptable and glamorous face of seduction in Britain. We meet at their second Agent Provocateur boutique in the depths of Knightsbridge. Rees, 32, beautiful with big, serious brown eyes, is wearing a Vivienne Westwood skirt and Prada high heels. Corr\u00e9, 33, is the son of Malcolm McLaren and Westwood - the woman who made underwear-as-outerwear a fashion item long before Madonna donned her conical bra - although he briskly rejects the suggestion that his mother has influenced his line of work. He is best described by adjectives such as \"dapper\" and speaks in a laidback, devil-may-care voice that only the exceptionally well-heeled can afford. </p> <p>Agent Provocateur is the stuff of high-fashion lingerie dreams: intricately lacy bras, delicate satin dressing-gowns. \"The choice [for women's lingerie] used to be cheap and cheerful Soho sex shops or big department stores that were just boring,\" says Corr\u00e9. \"We knew there was a market for something else.\" </p> <p>Since the first Agent Provocateur boutique opened in Soho in 1994, Britain's attitude to sexy lingerie has undoubtedly changed. The G-strings and lacy little things on sale in the high street now would have been outrageous a decade ago. What brought about this revolution? \"We did,\" Corr\u00e9 replies bluntly. \"And I'm not being arrogant here.\" </p> <p>Corr\u00e9 remains coy about Agent Provocateur's turnover, or even how much its deal with Marks and Spencer, for whom it designs the Salon Rose line of lingerie, is worth (they deny that it was \u00a31m). Nevertheless, Agent Provocateur has been a true success story. Its website received 23m hits in December; its two London locations are part of the Knowledge test cab drivers must learn. \"Wanting to look and feel sexy, it's just a primal thing,\" states Corr\u00e9. </p> <p>Primal maybe, expensive certainly: a bra here can set you back \u00a3100, knickers up to \u00a380 and a nightgown easily costs \u00a3200 (a crystal-studded whip, by the way, is \u00a3120). The day I went into the shop, all of the women musing their way through the racks were carrying either Prada or Dior bags, which pretty much sums up the clientele. </p> <p>Corr\u00e9 and Rees met in 1992 (\"Was it that long ago? Hmm, time flies!\" he muses) and married last year. In the past nine years they have spent almost every day together. Do they ever find it claustrophobic to live and work together? They look surprised at the question, as though they had never even considered it.</p> <p>They are glamorous, successful and happy but surprisingly defensive. Before the interview begins Rees asks sharply: \"Can I just ask, what is the angle on this piece?\" </p> <p>They both keep their arms crossed and refuse to make eye-contact with anyone but each other for the first half hour.

      "bodyText": "It was the bed that really stood out. There it was, four-postered, in the middle of the Connaught ballroom in London, while Madonna, Lady Victoria Hervey and assorted double-barrelled names teetered and tittered on their Gucci stilettos, celebrating the launch of Agent Provocateur's perfume in November. On the bed, an improbably proportioned model writhed on the sheets. If this is how they launch a perfume, one suspects that Valentine's Day for Agent Provocateur's owners, Serena Rees and Joe Corr\u00e9, will involve more than dinner for two at the local Italian and a box of Ferrero Rocher. Rees and Corr\u00e9 are the acceptable and glamorous face of seduction in Britain. We meet at their second Agent Provocateur boutique in the depths of Knightsbridge. Rees, 32, beautiful with big, serious brown eyes, is wearing a Vivienne Westwood skirt and Prada high heels. Corr\u00e9, 33, is the son of Malcolm McLaren and Westwood - the woman who made underwear-as-outerwear a fashion item long before Madonna donned her conical bra - although he briskly rejects the suggestion that his mother has influenced his line of work. He is best described by adjectives such as \"dapper\" and speaks in a laidback, devil-may-care voice that only the exceptionally well-heeled can afford. Agent Provocateur is the stuff of high-fashion lingerie dreams: intricately lacy bras, delicate satin dressing-gowns. \"The choice [for women's lingerie] used to be cheap and cheerful Soho sex shops or big department stores that were just boring,\" says Corr\u00e9. \"We knew there was a market for something else.\" Since the first Agent Provocateur boutique opened in Soho in 1994, Britain's attitude to sexy lingerie has undoubtedly changed. The G-strings and lacy little things on sale in the high street now would have been outrageous a decade ago. What brought about this revolution? \"We did,\" Corr\u00e9 replies bluntly. \"And I'm not being arrogant here.\" Corr\u00e9 remains coy about Agent Provocateur's turnover, or even how much its deal with Marks and Spencer, for whom it designs the Salon Rose line of lingerie, is worth (they deny that it was \u00a31m). Nevertheless, Agent Provocateur has been a true success story. Its website received 23m hits in December; its two London locations are part of the Knowledge test cab drivers must learn. \"Wanting to look and feel sexy, it's just a primal thing,\" states Corr\u00e9. Primal maybe, expensive certainly: a bra here can set you back \u00a3100, knickers up to \u00a380 and a nightgown easily costs \u00a3200 (a crystal-studded whip, by the way, is \u00a3120). The day I went into the shop, all of the women musing their way through the racks were carrying either Prada or Dior bags, which pretty much sums up the clientele. Corr\u00e9 and Rees met in 1992 (\"Was it that long ago? Hmm, time flies!\" he muses) and married last year. In the past nine years they have spent almost every day together. Do they ever find it claustrophobic to live and work together? They look surprised at the question, as though they had never even considered it. They are glamorous, successful and happy but surprisingly defensive. Before the interview begins Rees asks sharply: \"Can I just ask, what is the angle on this piece?\" They both keep their arms crossed and refuse to make eye-contact with anyone but each other for the first half hour. Just as their wariness is beginning to melt away, hackles are raised again at a reference to Ann Summers, the more outr\u00e9, S&amp;M-oriented chain. \"Such comparisons are made by people who just don't have much experience in the subject,\" says Corr\u00e9, bitingly. Rees lays out on the table their recent campaign, which involved a series of publicity postcards of a woman's body, lovingly shot, clad in black bra, knickers and stockings. \"I can't see that these are controversial,\" she says, looking at them tenderly. \"I think they're beautiful.\" They say their critics accuse Agent Provocateur of being a pornography shop (which, despite its over-the-top window displays, it is not) and therefore exploitative. \"Germaine Greer and people like her say that you shouldn't wear things like this, that such adornments mean you're not part of the sisterhood,\" says Corr\u00e9. \"The whole point is letting women feel sexy and self-confident for themselves. Yes, it's nice for others to find you sexy, but it's about feeling good about yourself,\" Rees adds. Anyway, back to Valentine's Day. Surely they must have some good gift suggestions? Unsurprisingly, their answer involves lingerie. \"It's just so much more personal than that clich\u00e9 of going out to dinner to a restaurant where all the other tables are set for two!\" Rees cries, rolling her eyes.

      "body": "<p>A character in Helen Fielding's novel Cause Celeb made the prediction: \"Celebrities have been promoting causes since the first world war, but you watch; this will become huge. In five years time, no cause will be complete without an accompanying star to promote it.\"</p> <p>The prophecy in the novel, which explored the bizarre situation that occurs when celebrities meet disaster zones, is fast becoming reality. Within two days of the earthquake shaking north eastern India, the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) had assembled a huge list of celebrities including Leslie Grantham, Pauline Collins and Mel from Big Brother to launch its appeal. As the first teams arrived in India to sift through the carnage, the press officers at the DEC, and at many of the fourteen charities it coordinates, were phoning agents all over the country to find household names to promote the appeal.</p> <p>A stranger to our culture might wonder why Leslie Grantham's telephone is one of the first to ring when the world is confronted with a catastrophe. Amita Arya, DEC press officer, argues that charities have to take a pragmatic approach. \"In an ideal world, the public will respond to a crisis from a humanitarian point of view,\" she says. \"But people who are not familiar with a faraway country will respond more readily if the situation is explained by a familiar face that is trusted and seen every day on the television.\"</p> <p>\"We video-taped interviews with many of the celebrities, so that we can market them later to other media,\" she adds. </p> <p>Ms Arya's language is revealing. Like it or not, charities working in the UK have to market disaster - preferably via television. Celebrities can get the message to the public at very little cost, in comparison to paying for an advertising campaign.</p> <p>However, there is some expense. Many charities now have a full-time staff member devoted to work with celebrities. Two years ago, Save the Children recruited its first celebrity coordinator, Wendy Bailey, who brought a full contact book with her from working as a producer for the BBC. Her duties include finding, briefing and accompanying celebrities through the process of delivering the charity's message. Many large charities are following suit, creating a post that falls somewhere between public relations and fundraising.</p> <p>Part of Helen Fielding's groundwork for her novel included research at Save the Children and Comic Relief. Ms Bailey says Cause Celeb was a perceptive lesson for charities: \"In the novel, a celebrity visiting a refugee camp didn't have a clue why she was going out there. It is inappropriate to put someone in that situation without them having some understanding - or personal contact - with the cause.\"</p> <p>Ms Bailey has recently worked with stars ranging from boy-band Westlife to TV chef Ainsley Harriot on Save the Children projects. At first glance, the association between the cause and the celebrity might seem tenuous, but Ms Bailey insists that celebrities are carefully chosen, either for their connection with children or their ability to inspire, on a project-by-project basis. \"You don't always need a celebrity, but they come into their own when you need to engage with the public on an issue,\" she says.</p> <p>According to Louise Tickle, a press officer who has worked with celebrities for Comic Relief and Community Service Volunteers, the call for celebrities from charities - and the public - is increasing. \"The demand is just insatiable. Anything with a celebrity sells better,\" she says.</p> <p>It seems we now need comedians and stars to deliver relief quickly. Is this another example of dumbing down?

      "bodyText": "A character in Helen Fielding's novel Cause Celeb made the prediction: \"Celebrities have been promoting causes since the first world war, but you watch; this will become huge. In five years time, no cause will be complete without an accompanying star to promote it.\" The prophecy in the novel, which explored the bizarre situation that occurs when celebrities meet disaster zones, is fast becoming reality. Within two days of the earthquake shaking north eastern India, the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) had assembled a huge list of celebrities including Leslie Grantham, Pauline Collins and Mel from Big Brother to launch its appeal. As the first teams arrived in India to sift through the carnage, the press officers at the DEC, and at many of the fourteen charities it coordinates, were phoning agents all over the country to find household names to promote the appeal. A stranger to our culture might wonder why Leslie Grantham's telephone is one of the first to ring when the world is confronted with a catastrophe. Amita Arya, DEC press officer, argues that charities have to take a pragmatic approach. \"In an ideal world, the public will respond to a crisis from a humanitarian point of view,\" she says. \"But people who are not familiar with a faraway country will respond more readily if the situation is explained by a familiar face that is trusted and seen every day on the television.\" \"We video-taped interviews with many of the celebrities, so that we can market them later to other media,\" she adds. Ms Arya's language is revealing. Like it or not, charities working in the UK have to market disaster - preferably via television. Celebrities can get the message to the public at very little cost, in comparison to paying for an advertising campaign. However, there is some expense. Many charities now have a full-time staff member devoted to work with celebrities. Two years ago, Save the Children recruited its first celebrity coordinator, Wendy Bailey, who brought a full contact book with her from working as a producer for the BBC. Her duties include finding, briefing and accompanying celebrities through the process of delivering the charity's message. Many large charities are following suit, creating a post that falls somewhere between public relations and fundraising. Part of Helen Fielding's groundwork for her novel included research at Save the Children and Comic Relief. Ms Bailey says Cause Celeb was a perceptive lesson for charities: \"In the novel, a celebrity visiting a refugee camp didn't have a clue why she was going out there. It is inappropriate to put someone in that situation without them having some understanding - or personal contact - with the cause.\" Ms Bailey has recently worked with stars ranging from boy-band Westlife to TV chef Ainsley Harriot on Save the Children projects. At first glance, the association between the cause and the celebrity might seem tenuous, but Ms Bailey insists that celebrities are carefully chosen, either for their connection with children or their ability to inspire, on a project-by-project basis. \"You don't always need a celebrity, but they come into their own when you need to engage with the public on an issue,\" she says. According to Louise Tickle, a press officer who has worked with celebrities for Comic Relief and Community Service Volunteers, the call for celebrities from charities - and the public - is increasing. \"The demand is just insatiable. Anything with a celebrity sells better,\" she says. It seems we now need comedians and stars to deliver relief quickly. Is this another example of dumbing down? Are the press - or the public - really unable to grasp the tragedy of a flood or a famine, without the need of a celebrity chef to pull their heart strings? Ms Tickle doesn't think so. \"It is easy to devalue it,\" she says. \"When a celebrity is genuinely touched on film, the response to it is huge. If a celebrity can change people's perception towards a whole continent, because the public can relate better to them, then it is well worthwhile.\"",

      "body": "<p>Every victor in elections promises a new dawn and Israel's prime minister-elected, the arch-hawk, Ariel Sharon, was no exception. But does the Israeli voters' embrace of a man whose character was forged in the early years of a state struggling for survival against hostile neighbours, represent a bold leap into the future, or a slide backwards to the past?</p> <p>Israeli media commentators today said the most signal element of Mr Sharon's huge election win was the unity he created in a society that is as sharply divided along religious and ethnic lines, as politics.</p> <p>Mr Sharon took 63.6% of the Jewish vote, according to the final count published on Thursday. He had a commanding lead over the outgoing prime minister, Ehud Barak, in all the cities of Israel, bar Tel Aviv, and took 91.1% of votes cast by Jews living in West Bank settlements.</p> <p>Aside from his slim lead in Tel Aviv, the only sector which stuck by Mr Barak was the kibbutzim, where he took 87.5% of the vote. The results are telling: the kibbutzim, or collective farms, which have been facing bankruptcy or re-organisation as Israel abandons its earlier agriculture-based economy, are the last bastions of his Labour movement. Tel Aviv, in contrast, is the last hold-out of the \"new Israel\" that Mr Barak, and the peace process, had symbolised.</p> <p>Until the eruption of the Palestinian uprising last September, Israelis were beginning to debate whether they had arrived at a \"post-Zionist\" society. After the existential threats to Israel receded with the signing of peace treaties with Egypt and Jordan, and the start of negotiations with the Palestinians, and even Syria, Israel could now become like any other country.</p> <p>The change was symbolised by the hi-tech boom, an industry that did away with borders, and eroded Israel's traditional feeling of isolation with business partnerships as far afield as Singapore and the US. At the same time, Israelis began to focus on internal problems that had for years been relegated to the backburner because of the security threat.</p> <p>They began to chafe at the growing influence of the religious minority on the state, launching court actions for the rights of lesbian mothers, and for dispensing with the orthodox Jewish monopoly on marriage and divorce.</p> <p>Environmental and consumer protection groups became more vocal, forcing Israel to think seriously about introducing a mass transit system, and about the pollution of its rivers. Shopping and clubbing and even the search for good restaurants were no longer deemed decadent activities. Last year, a researcher published a PhD on Israeli backpackers in India.</p> <p>There was even concern within military circles that the years of peace were sapping the morale of Israel's citizen army, with adult males growing increasingly lax about fulfilling their reserve duty, and the hi-tech industry luring away intelligence and communications officers with lucrative job offers.</p> <p>When he was elected in 1999, Mr Barak seemed to symbolise the shift. By the standards of Israeli politics, he was relatively young - aged 57 - when he came to power. He lived in one of the new bedroom communities near Tel Aviv, popular among professionals seeking a house with a garden, and though he emerged from the army, he was also trained as a systems analyst in the US.</p> <p>He promised to modernise the economy, and he appointed an education minister who put a Palestinian nationalist poet on the state curriculum. But after the frightening spectacle of the Palestinian uprising, Israelis have turned their backs on all that Mr Barak represented. \"Yes, it's true. I wanted him once,\" said Gvili Mantina, casting her vote in Jerusalem on Tuesday. \"But look at what he did - he killed us. We can't go on this way.\"</p> <p>At aged 73, Mr Sharon is most definitely part of the old Israel. He began fighting his country's wars in 1948, and he retains a narrow view of Israel as a nation perpetually under siege.

      "bodyText": "Every victor in elections promises a new dawn and Israel's prime minister-elected, the arch-hawk, Ariel Sharon, was no exception. But does the Israeli voters' embrace of a man whose character was forged in the early years of a state struggling for survival against hostile neighbours, represent a bold leap into the future, or a slide backwards to the past? Israeli media commentators today said the most signal element of Mr Sharon's huge election win was the unity he created in a society that is as sharply divided along religious and ethnic lines, as politics. Mr Sharon took 63.6% of the Jewish vote, according to the final count published on Thursday. He had a commanding lead over the outgoing prime minister, Ehud Barak, in all the cities of Israel, bar Tel Aviv, and took 91.1% of votes cast by Jews living in West Bank settlements. Aside from his slim lead in Tel Aviv, the only sector which stuck by Mr Barak was the kibbutzim, where he took 87.5% of the vote. The results are telling: the kibbutzim, or collective farms, which have been facing bankruptcy or re-organisation as Israel abandons its earlier agriculture-based economy, are the last bastions of his Labour movement. Tel Aviv, in contrast, is the last hold-out of the \"new Israel\" that Mr Barak, and the peace process, had symbolised. Until the eruption of the Palestinian uprising last September, Israelis were beginning to debate whether they had arrived at a \"post-Zionist\" society. After the existential threats to Israel receded with the signing of peace treaties with Egypt and Jordan, and the start of negotiations with the Palestinians, and even Syria, Israel could now become like any other country. The change was symbolised by the hi-tech boom, an industry that did away with borders, and eroded Israel's traditional feeling of isolation with business partnerships as far afield as Singapore and the US. At the same time, Israelis began to focus on internal problems that had for years been relegated to the backburner because of the security threat. They began to chafe at the growing influence of the religious minority on the state, launching court actions for the rights of lesbian mothers, and for dispensing with the orthodox Jewish monopoly on marriage and divorce. Environmental and consumer protection groups became more vocal, forcing Israel to think seriously about introducing a mass transit system, and about the pollution of its rivers. Shopping and clubbing and even the search for good restaurants were no longer deemed decadent activities. Last year, a researcher published a PhD on Israeli backpackers in India. There was even concern within military circles that the years of peace were sapping the morale of Israel's citizen army, with adult males growing increasingly lax about fulfilling their reserve duty, and the hi-tech industry luring away intelligence and communications officers with lucrative job offers. When he was elected in 1999, Mr Barak seemed to symbolise the shift. By the standards of Israeli politics, he was relatively young - aged 57 - when he came to power. He lived in one of the new bedroom communities near Tel Aviv, popular among professionals seeking a house with a garden, and though he emerged from the army, he was also trained as a systems analyst in the US. He promised to modernise the economy, and he appointed an education minister who put a Palestinian nationalist poet on the state curriculum. But after the frightening spectacle of the Palestinian uprising, Israelis have turned their backs on all that Mr Barak represented. \"Yes, it's true. I wanted him once,\" said Gvili Mantina, casting her vote in Jerusalem on Tuesday. \"But look at what he did - he killed us. We can't go on this way.\" At aged 73, Mr Sharon is most definitely part of the old Israel. He began fighting his country's wars in 1948, and he retains a narrow view of Israel as a nation perpetually under siege. On the campaign trail, he spoke of injecting \"Zionist values\" into the education, and into bolstering pride, as Israelis and as Jews. \"There are a lot of values that people have forgotten over the last few years, \" Mr Sharon said recently, \"love of country, love of Judaism, and unity.\" Even his choice of address is a throwback to the pioneer years of the state: he lives on a ranch in the southern Negev, answering the call of Israel's first prime minister to make the desert bloom. Mr Sharon's main concession to modernity during the campaign was to moderate his hardline image. But even that may have to go, because the hard core nationalists, religious Jews, and ordinary Israelis who voted for him are looking for a strongman to restore their battered sense of security. In doing so, they are also turning their backs on the possibility of a broader vision of Israel. Mr Sharon is fond of saying. \"We have only one small country.\" Israelis, this week, agreed with him.

He is trying to poach Sunday Mirror showbusiness columnist Ian Hyland as the new showbusiness editor of the Sunday Express. Mr Hyland has carved out a niche as the scourge of Mr and Mrs Beckham, personal friends of Mr Desmond. Victoria Beckham, in particular, has been the subject of a torrent of bitchy stories in the paper's gossip pages. Mr Hyland was blacklisted by the Spice Girls after he claimed that Victoria wears a wig while on stage with the Spice Girls, that the Beckhams considered appearing in a Playboy shoot and that their house was infested with mould. Insiders say a showbusiness desk involving Mr Hyland on a Desmond-run newspaper would make for an \"interesting\" political situation. The move stresses the importance to Mr Desmond of showbusiness and celebrity news in the Express titles and may also be a sign that he is willing to be critical of celebrities despite the possible clash of interests with his sugary celebrity magazine, OK! He wants to create greater \"synergies\" between his newspapers and the celebrity weekly OK! he owns.",

      "bodyText": "The raucous sound of twittering parrots and budgerigars has filled Brussels' gothic Grand Place every Sunday morning for the past hundred years. However, the city's bureaucrats are about to silence the birds once and for all. The town's popular market, a favourite with tourists who love to stand and gawp at the exotic selection of birds from farflung corners of the globe on sale, has been ordered to shut up shop. Brussels' minister for commerce and the environment, Philippe Decloux, is concerned that the birds are kept in cruel conditions and argues that many of them are diseased, posing a risk to public health. The Royal Belgian League for the Protection of Birds also suspects that many of the birds are endangered species and believes that the market is little more than a cover for traffickers dealing in these protected species. However, the decision to shut the market altogether rather than to force the 13 or so regular bird traders who gather there every week to clean up their act is certain to disappoint tourists and will anger aficionados. The market, which is thought to have started hawking birds during the 19th century, sells exotic parrots from Africa and Asia as well as more common household pets such as canaries and budgerigars. \"It's not normal to shut down something which has existed for so long,\" says bird trader Arthur Mannaert. \"It's because of the political parties and the bird protectors. They try to put everything in a bad light but I've been coming here for 34 years.\" A few enlightened politicians have already raised the idea of reopening the market with much stricter controls on the birds sold but Mr Decloux, a member of the Green Party, is adamant that the closure is definitive... for now. \"We can't send veterinary officials to check up on the market every week,\" argues one of his officials when asked whether the market could be reopened.

Local authorities also face huge costs to prevent \"catastrophic\" flooding that could cause widespread destruction and leave tens of thousands of people temporarily homeless. Billions of pounds may need to be spent on concrete flood defences while some coastal regions could even be abandoned. The report, by the Expert Group on Climate Change and Health, is the first official assessment of the effect of global warming on health and has been launched by the government's chief medical officer, Professor Liam Donaldson. The Health Effects of Climate Change recommends that efforts to reduce the impact of global warming should continue and an expanded research programme should be established \"as a matter of urgency\". Prof Donaldson warned: \"If global climate changes continue unchecked there will be an impact on the health of the population of this country.\" Average temperatures in the UK are expected to rise by up to 2.3 degrees celsius, leading to hotter, drier summers and more intense heatwaves. Heatwaves such as the one in 1976 are currently expected once in every 350 years. But by 2050, they could occur every five to six years.

The terrestrial premiere of Star Trek: First Contact - in which Enterprise captain Jean-Luc Picard leads his crew against old enemy the Borg - gained 6.3m viewers and a 26% share, according to unofficial overnights. The movie was broadcast between 8.05pm and 9.50pm. It was up against ITV's Who Wants to be a Millionaire? between 8pm and 9pm, followed by drama At Home with the Braithwaites from 9pm to 10pm. Millionaire had 10.2m viewers, while the Braithwaites pulled in 8.6m. Channel 5's repeat of Rutger Hauer thriller the Hitcher, screened as part of the broadcaster's Murder Week, pulled in 1.6m viewers and an 8% share between 9pm and 11pm.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<b>Why is it in the news now?</b> <br>The combined measles, mumps and rubella (German measles) vaccine is back in the news because a study from the Boston University school of medicine found no link between MMR and a rise in cases of autism in the UK. The results contradict the findings of Andrew Wakefield, a consultant gastroenterologist at the Royal Free hospital in London. He claims that the vaccination was not tested thoroughly enough for safety before it was introduced in Britain in 1988, and he published a paper in the medical journal, Adverse Drug Reactions, which claims that children given the combined jab were not followed up for long enough to be sure that there were no side-effects. <p><b>Is the MMR vaccine dangerous? </b><br>The balance of medical evidence suggests it is not dangerous, despite earlier, smaller studies from Mr Wakefield and from researchers in the US that suggested MMR causes autism and Crohn's disease, a serious bowel disorder. Finnish researchers followed 2m children for 14 years after they received the MMR vaccine and found no evidence that the vaccination resulted in later health problems. The government says the vaccine is perfectly safe. But many parents are still concerned. </p> <p><b>Who gets the MMR jab and when? </b><br>The vaccine is currently given to children twice, once at about a year old and the second time at about four years old. The second injection is intended to catch anyone who missed out on the first one and to provide protection to any children who may not have been fully immunised by the first jab. Before MMR, children received separate vaccinations for each disease.</p> <p><b>What does the health profession say? </b><br>Nearly half of family doctors, health visitors and practice nurses have reservations about giving children their second dose of the MMR vaccine, according to recently published research. However, only 3% actually disagreed with the policy of giving two injections, and many of the objections had to do with subjecting children to two needles rather than with the health risks.</p> <p><b>There's not much measles, mumps and rubella around today in this country, so why do we still need the vaccine? </b><br>The success of vaccinations in defeating diseases depends upon the vast majority - about 95% - of the population receiving the vaccine. If a significant number of parents stopped giving MMR to their children, then health experts say the diseases could reach epidemic proportions. The immunisation level in the UK has dropped to 88% overall and down to 75% in some areas. Government health experts say an epidemic could be just around the corner. The last UK outbreak in 1980 killed 17 people.</p> <p><b>If the disease is dangerous and the vaccination is dangerous, what is the alternative? </b><br>Some suggest that it is safer to give children the separate vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella.

      "bodyText": "Why is it in the news now? The combined measles, mumps and rubella (German measles) vaccine is back in the news because a study from the Boston University school of medicine found no link between MMR and a rise in cases of autism in the UK. The results contradict the findings of Andrew Wakefield, a consultant gastroenterologist at the Royal Free hospital in London. He claims that the vaccination was not tested thoroughly enough for safety before it was introduced in Britain in 1988, and he published a paper in the medical journal, Adverse Drug Reactions, which claims that children given the combined jab were not followed up for long enough to be sure that there were no side-effects. Is the MMR vaccine dangerous? The balance of medical evidence suggests it is not dangerous, despite earlier, smaller studies from Mr Wakefield and from researchers in the US that suggested MMR causes autism and Crohn's disease, a serious bowel disorder. Finnish researchers followed 2m children for 14 years after they received the MMR vaccine and found no evidence that the vaccination resulted in later health problems. The government says the vaccine is perfectly safe. But many parents are still concerned. Who gets the MMR jab and when? The vaccine is currently given to children twice, once at about a year old and the second time at about four years old. The second injection is intended to catch anyone who missed out on the first one and to provide protection to any children who may not have been fully immunised by the first jab. Before MMR, children received separate vaccinations for each disease. What does the health profession say? Nearly half of family doctors, health visitors and practice nurses have reservations about giving children their second dose of the MMR vaccine, according to recently published research. However, only 3% actually disagreed with the policy of giving two injections, and many of the objections had to do with subjecting children to two needles rather than with the health risks. There's not much measles, mumps and rubella around today in this country, so why do we still need the vaccine? The success of vaccinations in defeating diseases depends upon the vast majority - about 95% - of the population receiving the vaccine. If a significant number of parents stopped giving MMR to their children, then health experts say the diseases could reach epidemic proportions. The immunisation level in the UK has dropped to 88% overall and down to 75% in some areas. Government health experts say an epidemic could be just around the corner. The last UK outbreak in 1980 killed 17 people. If the disease is dangerous and the vaccination is dangerous, what is the alternative? Some suggest that it is safer to give children the separate vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella. It is only the combined vaccine that has been linked to autism and bowel disease. So why not administer the vaccines separately? The problem is that in the time between the vaccinations, children can catch one of the diseases. The head of vaccination at the Department of Health, Dr David Salisbury, sites the example of Japan, where the vaccinations are administered separately and 79 people died from measles between 1992 and 1997. What should parents do? Many parents are choosing to give their children only the first vaccination at between 12 and 15 months old. Of course some are choosing not to vaccinate at all, even though that carries the risk of a measles epidemic.

There were also some spectacular risers and fallers in the list, which is produced every two years by independent branding organisation Superbrands. Personal organiser Psion jumped from number 326 to 75. It eclipsed the paper organiser brand Filofax, which fell from 341 to 467. The nation's obsession with decorating - and a successful advertising campaign - propelled Dulux from position 80 to 44. Tetley Tea climbed from 194 to 138 and Persil rose from 108 to 42. Also on the up were Kellogg's Corn Flakes, Mars and Virgin Atlantic, which were all in the top 10. But Moss Bros, the troubled men's tailor, fell from 245 to 438. A company restructure, new chain of stores and \u00a31m rebranding campaign through ad agency McCann-Erickson may remedy the slide over the next two years. Other brands to fall were Seiko, down from 175 in 1998 to 452 in 2000, Flymo fell from 202 to 443 and Hoover slipped from 257 position 378. And the only internet brands to make it on to the list were Lastminute.com, Hotmail, AOL and Ask Jeeves. The Superbrands organisation enlisted a council of nine marketing, advertising, branding, design and PR luminaries to judge what made a brand a superbrand. The head of ad agency BMP DDB and New Labourite Chris Powell, Virgin corporate affairs director Will Whitehorn and BT head of design David Mercer were among the council members. The criteria they used included marketing, advertising, strength of recall, strength of brand, image and brand values. The list contained 600 brands, of which the top 100 are considered the superbrands. Pret a Manger and Lastminute.com made it on to the list - at positions 136 and 106 respectively - courtesy of their strong presence in the minds of consumers over the past two years. Forty-year-old brand Dr Martens made it to number 274 thanks to a brand revamp and advertising through TBWA/London. Superbrands global chairman Marcel Knobil said: \"The findings of the Superbrands council demonstrate great brands only maintain their strength with the benefit of ongoing excellent brand stewardship. \"However exceptional a brand, you cannot afford to neglect or mishandle it for long.\" The organisation has produced a list of internet superbrands, called eBrandLeaders, for the first time. The four web brands to have made it on to the consumer list were joined by 21store.com, Deal4Free and UpMyStreet.co.uk.",

It does not mean that the circumstances in which Mr Bush gained the presidency are either acceptable or forgotten. It does not mean that I either approve or disapprove of his policies. And it does not mean that he will continue to perform as successfully for the remainder of his four-year term.</p> <p>What it means is merely this. Given the circumstances, Mr Bush could hardly have played his hand better than he has done. He has been smart. He has been consistent. And he is changing the terms of the American political contest in his favour.</p> <p>In the three weeks since he claimed the White House, the new president has had a lot of luck. Much of it came courtesy of Bill Clinton. Some of it came from the realisation that the American media wants to be nice to the new president. But Mr Bush has also made some of it himself.</p> <p>For one thing, Mr Bush has learned from the past. He has twigged that the fastest way for a Republican to lose credibility is to bang on about Mr Clinton. And he has worked out that if you stick to your headline promises, like tax cuts, people do not worry if you let the lesser ones slip, like instantly pumping money into the Pentagon.</p> <p>Purely from a technical point of view, Mr Bush's management of the first three weeks of his presidency has been near perfect. He got his experienced cabinet sorted quickly. He has schmoozed the Democrats to such an extent that he has barely appeared to bother talking to members of his own party.</p> <p>He led from strength in his first pronouncements, focusing on an issue on which he has always been strong and which is a top priority of the voters: education. A week ago, he dominated the agenda with his so-called \"faith-based\" initiatives. This week, he has done the same on tax cuts. As modern political management, it has been almost flawless.</p> <p>To repeat. I am not offering approval, wide-eyed or otherwise. Nor disapproval either. The point is simply that Mr Bush very clearly knows what he is doing, and from his point of view, what he is doing is surely the right thing. That's one reason why the Democrats don't quite know how to respond.</p> <p>In fact, Mr Bush is doing exactly what he did when he became governor of Texas in 1994, again after narrowly defeating a formidable incumbent Democratic opponent. He is being seen reaching out, being generous, appearing magnanimous, assiduously acquiring a considerate and civil image. He is cultivating approval by very consciously, and very deliberately, putting himself above the daily political battle. If you want to look at it this way, he is putting the presidency to work.</p> <p>This week, the opinion polls delivered their first verdict on Mr Bush as president. After two weeks in office, Mr Bush had an initial approval rating of 57% in Gallup's regular monthly survey, with 25% disapproving and 18% unsure. The numbers tell several stories.</p> <p>First, the approval rating is quite good. It is one point below Mr Clinton's first poll in 1993 and seven points higher than both his father's debut presidential rating in 1989 and, more interestingly, Ronald Reagan's in 1981.</p> <p>Second, Mr Bush's disapproval rating is the highest since Gallup began tracking the question more than 50 years ago. In the past, presidents had to acquire their enemies. Mr Bush comes with them ready dressed (I was going to say \"ready armed\" but this is hardly the right week to put it that way).</p> <p>Finally, and clearly the other side of the same coin, fewer people are unsure what they think about Mr Bush than about any president in the poll's history. When Mr Bush's father entered the White House 12 years ago, by contrast, 43% of Americans did not know what they thought about him, even though he was a wholly familiar figure who had served the previous eight years as vice-president.</p> <p>What does this all add up to? It says that Mr Bush is a divisive figure, but the divisiveness is decreasing compared with the Florida aftermath. Next month's polls will make interesting reading, but look for a further improvement. Some tempers are abating, partly because Bush has set out so diligently to make them abate. Here's the point. It's a very focused strategy, and it is working, at least initially. This brings us to another lesson from Texas.

      "body": "<p>The man who once harboured ambitions to take the most glamorous post in the cabinet - that of foreign secretary - has certainly been earning his airmiles in recent weeks.</p> <p>For Peter Mandelson, a Christmas trip to the archaeological wonders of Syria (he went to the ancient ruins in Palmyra and the crusader castles at Krac de Chevalier) was followed by a weekend jaunt to Paris (where he took the fatal call from the Observer which was to lead to his downfall whilst perusing the exhibits of the Museum of Asiatic Art), and then, of course, the tearful flight to the States in the wake of his one undeniably unique achievement - a second resignation from frontbench politics.</p> <p>Now rumours of a new jetsetting post are circulating the cramped press gallery of the House of Commons (if not Downing Street itself): that of European commissioner. Britain at present has two Euro commissioners, Neil Kinnock and Chris Patten, neither of whom has the public profile, access to the PM and organising abilities of the MP for Hartlepool.</p> <p>The chance of an unheard-of third bite of the cherry is not as preposterous as it might seem to those whose interest in politics is confined to healthily dismissive headlines of the tabloids. While Peter Mandelson may never be able to persuade the rightwing press and the ordinary public he is a man of probity, he has opened up a window of opportunity for himself among the Westminster chattering classes - the only audience which has ever really mattered to him.</p> <p>Because if, as seems increasingly possible, he is cleared by Sir Anthony Hammond QC in the inquiry currently underway into the Hinduja passports affair, then he presents Tony Blair with a problem without precedent in British politics: the minister who resigned for no reason. And thus a minister looking for reward, in lieu of revenge.</p> <p>A return to cabinet-level government, even after the election, would be too politically damaging. Cleared or not, Mandelson is damaged goods and he has already watched his career being written off by cabinet colleagues Clare Short, Geoff Hoon and Alistair Darling - all in front of the TV cameras.</p> <p>But a post at the heart of Europe, well away from Westminster, in an organisation as desperately in need of reform as Labour was in the 1980s? Well, there's one candidate ready, willing and able, currently \"between jobs\" and with a CV to die for.</p> <p>The press campaign for resurrection has already begun - if a week is a long time in politics, a month or two is long enough for an entire political rebirth. The only question is how he can do all this without embarrassing Blair; but if he can, the Mandelson roadshow could be back in Brussels.</p> <p><b>Special report</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/\">New Labour in power</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mandelson/story/0,7369,435809,00.html\">09.02.2001, analysis: A comeback for Mandelson?</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mandelson/story/0,7369,435683,00.html\">09.02.2001: Defiant Mandelson risks Labour wrath</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mandelson/story/0,7369,434057,00.html\">06.02.2001: The whiff of sleaze that just won't go away</a> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mandelson/story/0,7369,430305,00.html\">29.01.2001: Cabinet cuts off Mandelson</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,430254,00.html\">29.01.2001, analysis: How Mandelson and Campbell came to blows</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,430250,00.html\">29.01.2001, analysis: 'I think Peter has been slightly detached'</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,430253,00.html\">29.01.2001: Brother deals new blow to Vaz</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,430189,00.html\">29.01.2001, leader: Spinning out of control</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,430167,00.html\">29.01.2001, Roy Hattersley: Why the passing of Peter isn't very important</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,429979,00.html\">28.01.2001, Andrew Rawnsley: Why he really had to go</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427850,00.html\">25.01.2001: A glittering career in ruins</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mandelson/story/0,7369,427840,00.html\">25.01.2001, Benjamin Wegg-Prosser: I'm Mandy, fire me</a></p> <p><b>Audio report</b><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0124mandelson.ra\">24.01.2001: Peter Mandelson's resignation statement</a></p> <p><b>Photo gallery</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/gall/0,8542,427511,00.html\">Peter Mandelson: a life in pictures</a></p> <p><b>Cartoon</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/graphic/0,7367,428461,00.html\">Steve Bell on life without Peter Mandelson</a></p> <p><b>The 1998 home loan row</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427485,00.html\">Text of resignation letter</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427469,00.html\">24.12.1998: Mandelson, the minister and the \u00a3373,000 loan</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427471,00.html\">24.12.1998: Mandelson: undone by a story that could not be done</a></p> <p><b>Andrew Rawnsley: inside New Labour</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,369240,00.html\">Mandelson resigns over his home loan</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,369238,00.html\">Rivals in the Labour party</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,366690,00.html\">How Mandy replaced Mo</a></p> <p><b>Talk about it</b><br><a href=\"http://talk.guardianunlimited.co.uk/WebX?13@@.ee7e6ee\">Have your say on the Mandelson affair</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.sunday-times.co.uk/news/pages/sti/2001/01/28/stifocnws02001.html\" target=\"_new\">Peter Mandelson: Why I had to go - Sunday Times, 28.01.2001</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427516,00.html\">24.01.2001: Full text of Mandelson's resignation statement</a><br><a href=\"http://www.hindujagroup.com/history.htm\" target=\"_new\">Hinduja group history</a><br><a href=\"http://www.number10.gov.uk/default.asp?PageId=3284\" target=\"_new\">Downing Street press briefing</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.hartlepoolmail.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Hartlepool Mail</a></p>",

For Peter Mandelson, a Christmas trip to the archaeological wonders of Syria (he went to the ancient ruins in Palmyra and the crusader castles at Krac de Chevalier) was followed by a weekend jaunt to Paris (where he took the fatal call from the Observer which was to lead to his downfall whilst perusing the exhibits of the Museum of Asiatic Art), and then, of course, the tearful flight to the States in the wake of his one undeniably unique achievement - a second resignation from frontbench politics. Now rumours of a new jetsetting post are circulating the cramped press gallery of the House of Commons (if not Downing Street itself): that of European commissioner. Britain at present has two Euro commissioners, Neil Kinnock and Chris Patten, neither of whom has the public profile, access to the PM and organising abilities of the MP for Hartlepool. The chance of an unheard-of third bite of the cherry is not as preposterous as it might seem to those whose interest in politics is confined to healthily dismissive headlines of the tabloids. While Peter Mandelson may never be able to persuade the rightwing press and the ordinary public he is a man of probity, he has opened up a window of opportunity for himself among the Westminster chattering classes - the only audience which has ever really mattered to him. Because if, as seems increasingly possible, he is cleared by Sir Anthony Hammond QC in the inquiry currently underway into the Hinduja passports affair, then he presents Tony Blair with a problem without precedent in British politics: the minister who resigned for no reason. And thus a minister looking for reward, in lieu of revenge. A return to cabinet-level government, even after the election, would be too politically damaging. Cleared or not, Mandelson is damaged goods and he has already watched his career being written off by cabinet colleagues Clare Short, Geoff Hoon and Alistair Darling - all in front of the TV cameras. But a post at the heart of Europe, well away from Westminster, in an organisation as desperately in need of reform as Labour was in the 1980s? Well, there's one candidate ready, willing and able, currently \"between jobs\" and with a CV to die for. The press campaign for resurrection has already begun - if a week is a long time in politics, a month or two is long enough for an entire political rebirth. The only question is how he can do all this without embarrassing Blair; but if he can, the Mandelson roadshow could be back in Brussels.

He said: \"These things just happen completely out of the blue in politics and politics is like that.</p> <p>\"Life goes on and it's like suddenly finding yourself in a ghastly road accident in which your car is written off and which you step from the wreckage and continue your life.</p> <p>\"You don't know how the accident happened, probably it was a combination of different factors and mistakes, including your own. It is being investigated, as accidents are - and you cooperate with the investigation, and that's what I'm doing now. But I keep my views to myself in public on what happened. Others can speculate and of course they will do but my public views will be kept for the investigation.\"</p> <p>He said that it would now be for Sir Anthony Hammond's inquiry to establish what really happened over his involvement in the passport application by the controversial Indian tycoon, Srichand Hinduja.</p> <p>He insisted he would be running as Hartlepool MP in the forthcoming general election and said he was relishing the forthcoming battle with such candidates as the miners' union leader, Arthur Scargill.</p> <p>However, according to unattributed press reports today, Mr Mandelson is seeking to secure a public acknowledgement from Tony Blair that the home secretary, Jack Straw, had been wrong to accuse him of having been \"untruthful\".</p> <p>While he was said to have accepted that a return to the cabinet would be difficult, he did want to clear his name and resume a role in public life, possibly as one of Britain's commissioners in Brussels.</p> <p>But Downing Street reacted coldly to reports that Mr Mandelson was seeking a role in Brussels.</p> <p>A No10 spokesman said: \"Peter resigned from the government for the reasons that he gave. I don't particularly intend to the get into the minutiae of what appear to be unsourced stories.\"</p> <p>The reports also drew a scathing response from Mr Prescott, who said: \"As I understand it, it is friends of friends. They are hardly friends of the Labour party,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. I think we should wait for the inquiry.

      "bodyText": "Peter Mandelson today likened his fall from office over the so-called \"passports-for-favours\" affair to a \"ghastly road accident\". In his first media interview since his dramatic resignation from the cabinet last month, he refused to be drawn on press reports that he now set his sights on a job as one of Britain's European commissioners. Earlier, however, the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, lashed out at \"friends\" of the former Northern Ireland secretary who had been briefing journalists on his behalf, saying that they were \"hardly friends of the Labour party\". Mr Mandelson took part today in a BBC Radio Cleveland phone-in at his Hartlepool constituency and said he still did not fully understand the events which led to his downfall. But he acknowledged that he may have made mistakes. He said: \"These things just happen completely out of the blue in politics and politics is like that. \"Life goes on and it's like suddenly finding yourself in a ghastly road accident in which your car is written off and which you step from the wreckage and continue your life. \"You don't know how the accident happened, probably it was a combination of different factors and mistakes, including your own. It is being investigated, as accidents are - and you cooperate with the investigation, and that's what I'm doing now. But I keep my views to myself in public on what happened. Others can speculate and of course they will do but my public views will be kept for the investigation.\" He said that it would now be for Sir Anthony Hammond's inquiry to establish what really happened over his involvement in the passport application by the controversial Indian tycoon, Srichand Hinduja. He insisted he would be running as Hartlepool MP in the forthcoming general election and said he was relishing the forthcoming battle with such candidates as the miners' union leader, Arthur Scargill. However, according to unattributed press reports today, Mr Mandelson is seeking to secure a public acknowledgement from Tony Blair that the home secretary, Jack Straw, had been wrong to accuse him of having been \"untruthful\". While he was said to have accepted that a return to the cabinet would be difficult, he did want to clear his name and resume a role in public life, possibly as one of Britain's commissioners in Brussels. But Downing Street reacted coldly to reports that Mr Mandelson was seeking a role in Brussels. A No10 spokesman said: \"Peter resigned from the government for the reasons that he gave. I don't particularly intend to the get into the minutiae of what appear to be unsourced stories.\" The reports also drew a scathing response from Mr Prescott, who said: \"As I understand it, it is friends of friends. They are hardly friends of the Labour party,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. I think we should wait for the inquiry. That is the proper thing to do.\" However, Mr Prescott also stressed that it was Mr Mandelson's own decision to resign over the account he gave of his role in the naturalisation application by Mr Hinduja, who donated \u00a31m to the Millennium Dome at a time when Mr Mandelson was the dome minister. The latest reports about Mr Mandelson were said to have caused deep anger in Labour circles as they upstaged the Mr Blair's keynote speech yesterday in which he set out his stall for the forthcoming general election. That was reflected by Mr Prescott who said: \"It is all the froth of politics. It doesn't mean a damn. It is the next steps of this government that people are concerned with, not the next steps of Peter Mandelson.\" Special report New Labour in power Related articles 09.02.2001: Analysis by Matthew Tempest 09.02.2001: Defiant Mandelson risks Labour wrath 06.02.2001: The whiff of sleaze that just won't go away 29.01.2001: Cabinet cuts off Mandelson 29.01.2001, analysis: How Mandelson and Campbell came to blows 29.01.2001, analysis: 'I think Peter has been slightly detached' 29.01.2001: Brother deals new blow to Vaz 29.01.2001, leader: Spinning out of control 29.01.2001, Roy Hattersley: Why the passing of Peter isn't very important 28.01.2001, Andrew Rawnsley: Why he really had to go 25.01.2001: A glittering career in ruins 25.01.2001, Benjamin Wegg-Prosser: I'm Mandy, fire me Audio 24.01.2001: Peter Mandelson's resignation statement Photo gallery Peter Mandelson: a life in pictures Cartoon Steve Bell on life without Peter Mandelson The 1998 home loan row Text of resignation letter 24.12.1998: Mandelson, the minister and the \u00a3373,000 loan 24.12.1998: Mandelson: undone by a story that could not be done Andrew Rawnsley: inside New Labour Mandelson resigns over his home loan Rivals in the Labour party How Mandy replaced Mo Talk about it Have your say on the Mandelson affair Useful links Peter Mandelson: Why I had to go - Sunday Times, 28.01.2001 24.01.2001: Full text of Mandelson's resignation statement Hinduja group history Downing Street press briefing Hartlepool Mail",

      "bodyText": "A row has broken out between BT and rival internet service providers over alleged anti-competitive practices. Freeserve and AOL Time Warner are threatening legal action, claiming BT gives unfair preference to its own broadband service when it sends engineers to install ADSL lines. Companies that want to offer ADSL have to buy the service wholesale from BT. But Freeserve, Britain's biggest ISP with more than 2m subscribers, has complained that BT Ignite, the division of BT that sells the ADSL lines, only allowed engineers to make 16 installations a day. In contrast, BT Openworld, the consumer broadband division of BT, is connecting up to 2,000 subscribers to ADSL a week. AOL's and Freeserve's gripe is that these figures show the supposed level playing field is heavily sloped in BT Openworld's favour. \"BT's revelation is a shocking admission,\" said Freeserve chief executive John Pluthero. \"It is institutionally restricting the market share of Freeserve and other competing broadband providers. \"At the current pathetic levels of allocation granted to us by BT, it would take us three to four years to get to where BT Openworld says it is today. \"UK consumers would be thoroughly justified in demanding the resignation of the entire BT board.\" AOL Spokesman Matt Peacock said: \"If these reports [of the rate of Openworld connections] are true, one of the options will be substantial and immediate legal action against BT.\" But BT is claiming the complaints are merely \"sour grapes\". \"I will be amazed if this threat of legal action comes to anything - it is Freeserve and AOL playing their usual games,\" said a BT spokesman. Oftel, the industry regulator, said it was taking the complaints seriously and investigating the matter. From this summer, BT will have to open up its local exchanges to enable competitors to offer their own version of ADSL. However, this \"unbundling\" process has hit a number of snags. Countless operators have pulled out, citing unreasonable behaviour by BT and insurmountable costs.",

In other words, think Hello! crossed with Through the Keyhole, with a little fashion advice on top - and, darn it, that's why we love it. We love it so much that many Britons have been forking out \u00a33 a month to subscribe to the US edition. But we will no longer have to make do with exfoliating tips from unknown American celebrities - we can get them from our own stars because In Style UK goes on sale next Friday. At last, we can learn how Martine McCutcheon arranges her scented candles and where Nicola Formby buys her quilted eiderdowns. Stop laughing - you know you'll read it.",

      "bodyText": "Bob the Builder creator HIT Entertainment has confirmed its \u00a3190m takeover of Lyrick Corporation, home of Barney the Dinosaur. The UK-based company hopes the deal will give it much needed overseas success. HIT relies heavily on Bob the Builder and realises it needs to strengthen its portfolio. \"While we will be assisted in extending our existing brands into the US, we will also be able to position Barney as a global brand,\" said Peter Orton, chief executive of HIT. \"This deal positions HIT as arguably one of the leaders in world pre-school programming.\" Barney is one of the best known children's characters in the US, having sold more than 55m videos and 68m books to parents and children. \"HIT is a wonderful company, which espouses the same values as we do - creating quality programmes for the pre-school market,\" said Dick Leach, founder of Lyrick. Both companies have reached a conditional agreement on the deal, which is expected to go through early next month. HIT will also use its new-found access to the US market to launch its lesser known characters, such as Kipper and Angelina Ballerina. Before the Lyrick acquisition, HIT had already signed a licensing deal with toymaker Mattel. It had also sold a package of Bob the Builder programmes to children's channel Nickelodeon. Analysts say a breakthrough in the US market is vital if the company is to boost its shares beyond their current level of 440p. Relevant stories Feb 8: Bob buys Barney Feb 1: Hit suspends shares",

      "body": "<p>John Hartson must have felt like that girl in the Popstars television series, who took herself to every regional audition round the country in the desperate hope of eventually catching Nasty Nigel's eye and making it to the big time.</p> <p>On four occasions in the past six months Hartson has been about to leave Wimbledon and return to top-flight football. And four times, with Tottenham, Rangers, Charlton and initially with Coventry, he failed the audition. He must have wondered if it was ever going to happen for him.</p> <p>\"The image he has on the field is not how he really is,\" says Jonathan Barnett, Hartson's agent. \"Of course he has this tough, Welsh, manly exterior and he didn't want to show it but he was hurt by those set-backs. I was the one who had to break the news each time and I saw it in his face. I knew it hurt.\"</p> <p>At last, yesterday, Hartson found himself back in the big time at least for the rest of this season. Coventry City at the moment hardly represent the safest of havens for a man whose stated intention is to play at the top level for the rest of his career. But for the past 30 months Hartson has been defined by failure: failed medicals, failed transfers, a failure to keep his foot out of range of hanging baskets outside pubs in Swansea. After that lot, anyone showing an interest is in danger of having his hand bitten off.</p> <p>\"What you have to remember, he is still only 25,\" says Barnett. \"With respect, 25-year-old footballers are not the most worldly-wise creatures and I think most of them would have buckled under what John has gone through.\"</p> <p>Certainly many a player would have torn his hair out; so at least he did not have that problem. The question is, given the baggage he carries with him, why would anyone want to sign Hartson at all?</p> <p>The answer lies in his time at West Ham, after he had been bought from Arsenal for \u00a35m towards the end of the 1996-97 season. Here, by scoring the goals that kept West Ham in the Premiership, he developed a reputation as a fire fighter, a man for a crisis, a man who relishes a challenge.</p> <p>The following year he was the second highest scorer in the division, with 24 league goals, most of which were supplied by Eyal Berkovic. This was a nice irony as Hartson's Upton Park career was effectively finished the moment he was filmed kicking Berkovic in the head during a training session. When Wimbledon offered \u00a37.5m for him soon after that incident, the great wheeler-dealer Harry Redknapp felt it a tidy bit of business for a player with a fragile temper. To complete the circle, his Coventry debut is likely to be Monday's encounter with the Hammers. </p> <p>Despite the video evidence, Joe Kinnear, then Wimbledon manager, had no doubts in buying Hartson.

      "bodyText": "John Hartson must have felt like that girl in the Popstars television series, who took herself to every regional audition round the country in the desperate hope of eventually catching Nasty Nigel's eye and making it to the big time. On four occasions in the past six months Hartson has been about to leave Wimbledon and return to top-flight football. And four times, with Tottenham, Rangers, Charlton and initially with Coventry, he failed the audition. He must have wondered if it was ever going to happen for him. \"The image he has on the field is not how he really is,\" says Jonathan Barnett, Hartson's agent. \"Of course he has this tough, Welsh, manly exterior and he didn't want to show it but he was hurt by those set-backs. I was the one who had to break the news each time and I saw it in his face. I knew it hurt.\" At last, yesterday, Hartson found himself back in the big time at least for the rest of this season. Coventry City at the moment hardly represent the safest of havens for a man whose stated intention is to play at the top level for the rest of his career. But for the past 30 months Hartson has been defined by failure: failed medicals, failed transfers, a failure to keep his foot out of range of hanging baskets outside pubs in Swansea. After that lot, anyone showing an interest is in danger of having his hand bitten off. \"What you have to remember, he is still only 25,\" says Barnett. \"With respect, 25-year-old footballers are not the most worldly-wise creatures and I think most of them would have buckled under what John has gone through.\" Certainly many a player would have torn his hair out; so at least he did not have that problem. The question is, given the baggage he carries with him, why would anyone want to sign Hartson at all? The answer lies in his time at West Ham, after he had been bought from Arsenal for \u00a35m towards the end of the 1996-97 season. Here, by scoring the goals that kept West Ham in the Premiership, he developed a reputation as a fire fighter, a man for a crisis, a man who relishes a challenge. The following year he was the second highest scorer in the division, with 24 league goals, most of which were supplied by Eyal Berkovic. This was a nice irony as Hartson's Upton Park career was effectively finished the moment he was filmed kicking Berkovic in the head during a training session. When Wimbledon offered \u00a37.5m for him soon after that incident, the great wheeler-dealer Harry Redknapp felt it a tidy bit of business for a player with a fragile temper. To complete the circle, his Coventry debut is likely to be Monday's encounter with the Hammers. Despite the video evidence, Joe Kinnear, then Wimbledon manager, had no doubts in buying Hartson. Yes, he had a temper on him; yes, he behaved as if every referee was out to get him; but he was a player in the old Crazy Gang mode, a player Kinnear says \"would put his head in the blades of a combine harvester if that's what it took to get a goal\". \"He's a special talent,\" says Terry Burton, latterly his manager at Selhurst Park. Besides being big and strong, Burton applauds a remarkably shrewd touch and a fierce eye for a goal. \"He is the best finisher I have ever worked with.\" These are qualities which brought Hartson high-profile admirers.

The ruling will put further pressure on the already stretched finances of the NHS and local government, and could land them with an administrative headache as they attempt to process claims from former employees stretching back nearly a quarter of a century. But many staff who could have claimed the rights - the majority of them women - will lose out because they failed to lodge claims for back-dated pensions within six months of leaving employment.

Meanwhile, <strong>Joan Smith</strong> asks why women are still so unhappy in bed.</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>In the 19th century the non-orgasmic woman was considered normal. In the early 20th century she was re-marketed as frigid. In the 21st century, it's just a matter of electronics. Now that science and technology are going to solve all our problems, it's no surprise that the latest White Coat Wonder can turn any woman into a throbbing mass of pleasure at the touch of a button. Forget the vibrator. The egg whisk approach to orgasm is as out of date as the missionary position. Women who live in rural backwaters will no longer have to worry about power cuts. There will be no need for the Saturday-night dash down to the garage for a bottle of Blue Nun and \"something for the weekend, madam?\" - a packet of Duracell. What price a new invention that you can hide in your buttocks instead of your sock drawer? The implant orgasm has arrived.</p> <p>I pity Dr Stuart Meloy, the surgeon who discovered by chance that electrical impulses have recreational value. He was just playing with his voltmeter, like any regular guy, when his patient started \"exclaiming emphatically\" - that's science-speak for coming on like a hot bunny - and then she said: \"You're going to have to teach my husband to do that.\"This is the nub, or the rub; if your husband doesn't turn you on, is it that he just hasn't found the switch?</p> <p>While poor Dr Meloy predicts only a tiny take-up for the cigarette-packet-size transmitter, it is clear that millions of husbands will be buying these things for their wives every Valentine's Day, Christmas and birthday. No more erectile dysfunction. No more Viagra on the black market. No more head down for hours with occasional gasps into an oxygen cylinder. </p> <p>If a woman doesn't come, she has failed to do her shopping properly. How can you blame your man when it's just a wiring problem? I am all for pleasure. I love sex. Sex is about being aroused by someone else and being happy in your own body. If neither applies to you, it's time for a change. All the gadgetry in the world won't make you pleased with yourself or attracted to another person. Electronic sex is another way of faking it.</p> <p>So much for the moral high ground. What about the practical problems? Electrical pulses are sensitive to their environment. At the moment of ecstasy, will you set the car alarm off? Will the car alarm set you off? I don't want to be routinely doing the beep in Waitrose carpark, only to find myself writhing over the windscreen like a photoshoot for Nude Reader's Wives. </p> <p>What happens on aeroplanes when the captain announces that all electronic devices must be switched off? What happens if your partner has a pacemaker fitted? I guess a hearing aid is safe enough. Sex makes you deaf anyway doesn't it, or is that only masturbation - and which is this? </p> <p>I have not read whether the device comes with a timer. Could you programme it like those burglar light switches that go and off at random? That would at least leave the element of surprise that comes with real sex. It might be a turn-on, wondering where you'll be, and with whom, when the first tingle starts.</p> <p>I predict that a remote control device will soon be invented, allowing unscrupulous persons to orgasm their target at will. With this in mind I propose a control group for clinical trials. How about traffic wardens, tax inspectors and Ann Widdecombe?</p> <p><strong>All talk and no action</strong><br><strong>Joan Smith</strong></p> <p>A device to produce female orgasms? Excuse me, but I think we've been here before, and I'm not talking about the penis - whose value in this context has long been the subject of debate - or the kind of battery-driven vibrator you can buy in sex shops. It was mooted as long as 32 years ago, in Roger Vadim's sci-fi movie Barbarella, when Jane Fonda found herself wired up to a machine called an Orgasmatron. </p> <p>But that was very much a male fantasy and this, apparently, is real life, an implant created by an American doctor that will give women a controlled number of orgasms, via a hand-held remote control.</p> <p>Such an invention immediately raises all sorts of questions, the most obvious being whose hand will be on the remote, not to mention what happens if your dog buries it in the garden. There is also, inevitably, a plan to include a regulator in the device to limit the number of orgasms each woman is permitted to have. \"But whether it's once a day, four times a week - who am I to say?\" its inventor, Dr Stuart Melroy, a surgeon from Winston-Salem in North Carolina, says.</p> <p>Melroy discovered how to give women orgasms by accident, while researching implants to control pain. His patient, who had been suffering severe back and leg pain, was having electrodes implanted near the base of her spine in order to direct a soothing current into her nervous system. But the electrodes stimulated her third sacral nerve and produced an orgasm, apparently leading her to exclaim: \"You are going to have to teach my husband to do that!\" Melroy went on to develop an implant for women who have not, for one reason or another, been able to achieve orgasms \"naturally\".</p> <p>Not every woman would want to have a titanium generator, attached to more than 40 electrodes, implanted under the skin at the top of her buttocks. But it might strike some women as preferable, and no less mechanical, than a bunk-up in a restaurant broom cupboard with the former Wimbledon champion Boris Becker, who has just accepted responsibility for a child conceived in just these circumstances. </p> <p>Reports that the former tennis ace \"made love\" with Anna Ermakova in a Mayfair restaurant stretch the familiar euphemism to breaking-point, as well as acting as a reminder of the laddish, performance-orientated culture we currently inhabit. </p> <p>Sex is everywhere, in the form of endless stories about footballers and rap artists doing it five times a night, but the emphasis is as relentlessly on numbers as it was in the old pre-feminist days of the sexual revolution.</p> <p>When Germaine Greer suggested that \"giving yourself a few jolts from a titanium implant is about as bad as sex can get\", she may have temporarily forgotten the anguished discussions that went on in the 1970s as women talked openly for the first time about how difficult it was to have orgasms. </p> <p>Indeed Vadim's Orgasmatron appeared in exactly the same year as one of feminism's ground-breaking texts, The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm, by Anne Koedt, which challenged Freud's insistence on the primacy of the vaginal orgasm. Koedt pointed out that \"since the clitoris is not necessarily stimulated sufficiently in the conventional sexual positions, we are left 'frigid' \". </p> <p>This label was so widely feared, in the 1960s, that many women had learned to give Oscar-winning performances in bed.</p> <p>Koedt's confident article opened the floodgates, building on the work already published by Masters and Johnson in Human Sexual Response in 1966. Suddenly everyone was talking about the female orgasm, a creature that turned out to be as elusive in some corners as the sighting of a very rare bird; in consciousness-raising groups, it was those of us who had not encountered the problem who felt awkward, staying silent for fear of seeming to boast.</p> <p>Feminists drew on the work of sexologists to support their angry discovery that women were not getting what they wanted in bed, with statistics pouring out from all kinds of sources. Only a third of the women studied by the sexologist Alfred Kinsey reported experiencing orgasm; Seymour Fisher found in 1973 that almost two-thirds of the women in his study did not have them with any consistency, while nearly 6% never had them at all; Shere Hite's survey in 1976 put the figure for non-orgasmic women even higher, at 11.6%. </p> <p>You can't help thinking that, if similar figures suddenly emerged about the number of men failing to achieve orgasm, there would be a royal commission on Sexual Dysfunction at the very least. We would see a rash of magazines articles on \"How to please your man\", and it would almost certainly merit a story strand involving Roy and Hailey or Ruth and David in The Archers.</p> <p>It is true that the combined effect of research and feminist rhetoric in the 1970s was dramatic, on women at least. Some feminists questioned whether heterosexual sex was capable of satisfying women at all; as they were quick to point out, placing the emphasis on the clitoris rather than the vagina effectively dethroned the penis from its primary role in straight sex, at least as far as women were concerned. </p> <p>Up and down the country, women enthusiastically set about examining their own bodies, blaming their lovers for their failure to stimulate them to orgasm instead of accepting Freud's dismissal of the clitoral orgasm as inferior. There was an urgent need, everyone agreed - or so it seemed at the time - for men to get their act together and start pleasing their partners, which usually involved lots of foreplay.</p> <p>So what happened? As recently as 1986, the feminist author Lisa Tuttle was still suggesting that \"normal\" sexuality needed to be reconsidered and redefined, with women's preferences at last taken into account. \"Anatomy alone,\" she declared, \"can no longer be used to explain why women should continue to choose men as sexual partners.\" Yet eight years later, in 1994, Hite reported that more than half the women in her latest survey were faking orgasm, with only 42% getting there with a male partner. More recently, studies have put the number of women who don't come regularly as high as 58%.</p> <p>What this suggests is that all those discussions, and revelations about the amazing size and sensitivity of the clitoris, have not in the end got us very far. On the contrary, they imply that large numbers of women are unsatisfied in bed, but have learned to do without orgasms or believe their partners don't understand their needs. The latter may well be true in some cases, although there is the question of whether men can't understand a very different pattern of arousal or can't be bothered to try.</p> <p>Of course this isn't true of all men, or there wouldn't be that happy fortysomething per cent of women who say in surveys that they come regularly with their lovers. But the chief difference between now and 30 years ago, as far as the female orgasm is concerned, is the fact that women have stopped talking about it. Clearly it is as problematic as ever, but in a laddish culture there seems even less point complaining. So perhaps titanium implants are the way forward and this week's headlines should have read: Men still failing in bed, women turn to machines.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In the 19th century the non-orgasmic woman was considered normal. In the early 20th century she was re-marketed as frigid. In the 21st century, it's just a matter of electronics. Now that science and technology are going to solve all our problems, it's no surprise that the latest White Coat Wonder can turn any woman into a throbbing mass of pleasure at the touch of a button. Forget the vibrator. The egg whisk approach to orgasm is as out of date as the missionary position. Women who live in rural backwaters will no longer have to worry about power cuts. There will be no need for the Saturday-night dash down to the garage for a bottle of Blue Nun and \"something for the weekend, madam?\" - a packet of Duracell. What price a new invention that you can hide in your buttocks instead of your sock drawer? The implant orgasm has arrived. I pity Dr Stuart Meloy, the surgeon who discovered by chance that electrical impulses have recreational value. He was just playing with his voltmeter, like any regular guy, when his patient started \"exclaiming emphatically\" - that's science-speak for coming on like a hot bunny - and then she said: \"You're going to have to teach my husband to do that.\"This is the nub, or the rub; if your husband doesn't turn you on, is it that he just hasn't found the switch? While poor Dr Meloy predicts only a tiny take-up for the cigarette-packet-size transmitter, it is clear that millions of husbands will be buying these things for their wives every Valentine's Day, Christmas and birthday. No more erectile dysfunction. No more Viagra on the black market. No more head down for hours with occasional gasps into an oxygen cylinder. If a woman doesn't come, she has failed to do her shopping properly. How can you blame your man when it's just a wiring problem? I am all for pleasure. I love sex. Sex is about being aroused by someone else and being happy in your own body. If neither applies to you, it's time for a change. All the gadgetry in the world won't make you pleased with yourself or attracted to another person. Electronic sex is another way of faking it. So much for the moral high ground. What about the practical problems? Electrical pulses are sensitive to their environment. At the moment of ecstasy, will you set the car alarm off? Will the car alarm set you off? I don't want to be routinely doing the beep in Waitrose carpark, only to find myself writhing over the windscreen like a photoshoot for Nude Reader's Wives. What happens on aeroplanes when the captain announces that all electronic devices must be switched off? What happens if your partner has a pacemaker fitted? I guess a hearing aid is safe enough. Sex makes you deaf anyway doesn't it, or is that only masturbation - and which is this? I have not read whether the device comes with a timer. Could you programme it like those burglar light switches that go and off at random? That would at least leave the element of surprise that comes with real sex. It might be a turn-on, wondering where you'll be, and with whom, when the first tingle starts. I predict that a remote control device will soon be invented, allowing unscrupulous persons to orgasm their target at will. With this in mind I propose a control group for clinical trials. How about traffic wardens, tax inspectors and Ann Widdecombe? All talk and no action Joan Smith A device to produce female orgasms? Excuse me, but I think we've been here before, and I'm not talking about the penis - whose value in this context has long been the subject of debate - or the kind of battery-driven vibrator you can buy in sex shops. It was mooted as long as 32 years ago, in Roger Vadim's sci-fi movie Barbarella, when Jane Fonda found herself wired up to a machine called an Orgasmatron. But that was very much a male fantasy and this, apparently, is real life, an implant created by an American doctor that will give women a controlled number of orgasms, via a hand-held remote control. Such an invention immediately raises all sorts of questions, the most obvious being whose hand will be on the remote, not to mention what happens if your dog buries it in the garden. There is also, inevitably, a plan to include a regulator in the device to limit the number of orgasms each woman is permitted to have. \"But whether it's once a day, four times a week - who am I to say?\" its inventor, Dr Stuart Melroy, a surgeon from Winston-Salem in North Carolina, says. Melroy discovered how to give women orgasms by accident, while researching implants to control pain. His patient, who had been suffering severe back and leg pain, was having electrodes implanted near the base of her spine in order to direct a soothing current into her nervous system. But the electrodes stimulated her third sacral nerve and produced an orgasm, apparently leading her to exclaim: \"You are going to have to teach my husband to do that!\" Melroy went on to develop an implant for women who have not, for one reason or another, been able to achieve orgasms \"naturally\". Not every woman would want to have a titanium generator, attached to more than 40 electrodes, implanted under the skin at the top of her buttocks. But it might strike some women as preferable, and no less mechanical, than a bunk-up in a restaurant broom cupboard with the former Wimbledon champion Boris Becker, who has just accepted responsibility for a child conceived in just these circumstances. Reports that the former tennis ace \"made love\" with Anna Ermakova in a Mayfair restaurant stretch the familiar euphemism to breaking-point, as well as acting as a reminder of the laddish, performance-orientated culture we currently inhabit. Sex is everywhere, in the form of endless stories about footballers and rap artists doing it five times a night, but the emphasis is as relentlessly on numbers as it was in the old pre-feminist days of the sexual revolution. When Germaine Greer suggested that \"giving yourself a few jolts from a titanium implant is about as bad as sex can get\", she may have temporarily forgotten the anguished discussions that went on in the 1970s as women talked openly for the first time about how difficult it was to have orgasms. Indeed Vadim's Orgasmatron appeared in exactly the same year as one of feminism's ground-breaking texts, The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm, by Anne Koedt, which challenged Freud's insistence on the primacy of the vaginal orgasm. Koedt pointed out that \"since the clitoris is not necessarily stimulated sufficiently in the conventional sexual positions, we are left 'frigid' \". This label was so widely feared, in the 1960s, that many women had learned to give Oscar-winning performances in bed. Koedt's confident article opened the floodgates, building on the work already published by Masters and Johnson in Human Sexual Response in 1966. Suddenly everyone was talking about the female orgasm, a creature that turned out to be as elusive in some corners as the sighting of a very rare bird; in consciousness-raising groups, it was those of us who had not encountered the problem who felt awkward, staying silent for fear of seeming to boast. Feminists drew on the work of sexologists to support their angry discovery that women were not getting what they wanted in bed, with statistics pouring out from all kinds of sources. Only a third of the women studied by the sexologist Alfred Kinsey reported experiencing orgasm; Seymour Fisher found in 1973 that almost two-thirds of the women in his study did not have them with any consistency, while nearly 6% never had them at all; Shere Hite's survey in 1976 put the figure for non-orgasmic women even higher, at 11.6%. You can't help thinking that, if similar figures suddenly emerged about the number of men failing to achieve orgasm, there would be a royal commission on Sexual Dysfunction at the very least. We would see a rash of magazines articles on \"How to please your man\", and it would almost certainly merit a story strand involving Roy and Hailey or Ruth and David in The Archers. It is true that the combined effect of research and feminist rhetoric in the 1970s was dramatic, on women at least. Some feminists questioned whether heterosexual sex was capable of satisfying women at all; as they were quick to point out, placing the emphasis on the clitoris rather than the vagina effectively dethroned the penis from its primary role in straight sex, at least as far as women were concerned. Up and down the country, women enthusiastically set about examining their own bodies, blaming their lovers for their failure to stimulate them to orgasm instead of accepting Freud's dismissal of the clitoral orgasm as inferior. There was an urgent need, everyone agreed - or so it seemed at the time - for men to get their act together and start pleasing their partners, which usually involved lots of foreplay. So what happened? As recently as 1986, the feminist author Lisa Tuttle was still suggesting that \"normal\" sexuality needed to be reconsidered and redefined, with women's preferences at last taken into account. \"Anatomy alone,\" she declared, \"can no longer be used to explain why women should continue to choose men as sexual partners.\" Yet eight years later, in 1994, Hite reported that more than half the women in her latest survey were faking orgasm, with only 42% getting there with a male partner. More recently, studies have put the number of women who don't come regularly as high as 58%. What this suggests is that all those discussions, and revelations about the amazing size and sensitivity of the clitoris, have not in the end got us very far. On the contrary, they imply that large numbers of women are unsatisfied in bed, but have learned to do without orgasms or believe their partners don't understand their needs. The latter may well be true in some cases, although there is the question of whether men can't understand a very different pattern of arousal or can't be bothered to try. Of course this isn't true of all men, or there wouldn't be that happy fortysomething per cent of women who say in surveys that they come regularly with their lovers. But the chief difference between now and 30 years ago, as far as the female orgasm is concerned, is the fact that women have stopped talking about it. Clearly it is as problematic as ever, but in a laddish culture there seems even less point complaining. So perhaps titanium implants are the way forward and this week's headlines should have read: Men still failing in bed, women turn to machines.",

This was a deliberate attempt to avoid giving hostile newspapers lines to twist which might frighten the horses of Middle England. But Blair was offering himself as a more cautious alternative to a regime seen as having over-reached itself.

In 1997, choosing between two comb-users, the electorate favoured Blair's bouncy brown over Major's flat grey.

Mr Hague is the first bald party leader to run in a culture of elective-slaphead men, in which footballers and pop stars deliberately shave off impressive barnets. Therefore the distinction between the smooth men and the hairy men is theoretically less. Mr Hague's scalp doctors have played to this by shaving back the stubbornly fluffy bits at the sides.

The remake of the Charlton Heston classic stars Mark Wahlberg as astronaut Leo Davidson, who gets pulled through a timewarp and crash-lands on a strange planet where talking apes rule over the human race. With the help of sympathetic chimpanzee activist Ari, played by English actress Helena Bonham-Carter, and a small band of human rebels, Leo leads the effort to evade the advancing gorilla army, led by General Thade, portrayed by actor Tim Roth. The quest leads Leo to the forbidden zone, which holds the shocking secrets of mankind's past and the key to its future A tide of toys, games and accessories for both children and adults will be launched to coincide with the movie's release.

There will also be watches and clocks for adults and children - from metal designs to teen fashion watches with interchangeable faces. A \"back to school\" stationery and luggage range, including A4 ringbinders, spiralbound notebooks, mobile phone covers, backpacks and purses, will aim to cash in on the timing of the movie release. A gift range includes collectable bean bag toys and cuddly toys, 3D keyrings and a variety of glassware &amp; photographic mugs. Character Options saw its share price shattered after overestimating demand for products relating to Star Wars: The Phantom Menace and was forced to cut 100 jobs. It was not the only problem caused by the weakening power of the Force - book publisher Dorling Kindersley had to be sold after a fiasco in which the company was left burdened with 10m unsold Star Wars books.",

      "bodyText": "The company which gave the world Viagra is now set to spice up the confectionery market. Pfizer's Adams division, manufacturer of brands including Dentyne and Halls, is launching a range of chocolate and fruit chew bars called Body Smarts. The products, which contain added vitamins and minerals, aim to take the guilt out of eating chocolate and chew bars. A $70m marketing campaign will launch Body Smarts in the US and Canada this summer. A company spokeswoman said a global roll-out was being considered. New York advertising agency Bates USA is creating an ad campaign with the theme, \"Sweet just got smart\", DVC Worldwide is working on PR and a sampling and in-store promotional push will support. The eight-strong Body Smarts range represents the breakthrough of so-called functional foods into the confectionery market. Functional foods contain added ingredients, which claim to be beneficial to general health or good for particular areas such as the heart or bones. Food and pharmaceutical companies are rushing to develop enriched products for this new, lucrative market. In the UK consumer groups have demanded legislation to regulate health claims on functional foods.. Novartis Consumer Health, the consumer brand of the Swiss pharmaceutical giant, launched its functional food brand Aviva in to Europe with a \u00a320m advertising spend; Johnson &amp; Johnson launched Benecol margarine which claims to cut cholesterol; Kellogg and Nestle have also launched functional products. Pfizer's Body Smarts will be available as crunch bars and fruit chews in Chocolate Peanut Crunch, Yogurt Berry Crunch, Strawberry Creamy Fruit Chews and Assorted Creamy Fruit Chews variants. \"Consumers are looking for real nutrition as opposed to products what simply have less of the 'bad stuff',\" said Adams USA president John Craig.",

      "bodyText": "Former City Slickers Anil Bhoyrul and James Hipwell have been told by their lawyers that proceedings against them for insider dealing by the Department of Trade and Industry are \"extremely unlikely\". Lawyers acting for the pair, the key players in the \"Mirrorgate\" share-tipping scandal, believe that the difficulty of proving insider dealing will deter DTI lawyers from prosecution. The scope of the inquiry, launched last year by DTI investigators after the scandal, is being widened beyond the City Slickers and other Mirror editorial staff to look at internet sites operated by share-tippers and day traders. Investigators have been concerned about how tips from the pair leaked to the City before publication in the Mirror. Among emails sent to and from the City Slickers and other Mirror staff were emails that suggest City traders were being given advanced warning that the Slickers were to tip a share in the newspaper. But it is thought it will be hard to prove that the pair were actively involved with insider trading. The DTI is thought to be focusing on allegations of \"market manipulation\" - a new crime established under financial legislation brought in last year. Lawyers for Mr Bhoyrul and Mr Hipwell are thought to have been fairly successful in establishing that the City Slickers offered few share \"scoops\", as the majority had appeared on internet sites beforehand. This week it emerged that Mr Bhoyrul has settled an unfair dismissal dispute with Mirror owners Trinity Mirror out of court. Meanwhile, Mr Hipwell, who is now working for publicist Max Clifford, has been told he will not be called to give evidence in front of the investigators. Mr Bhoyrul and Mr Hipwell were fired from the popular City Slickers column they produced on the Mirror after it emerged that the paper's editor, Piers Morgan, had bought shares in computer manufacturer Viglen shortly before the column tipped the shares. Although censured by the Press Complaints Commission, Mr Morgan was cleared of wrongdoing in an internal inquiry by Trinity Mirror. Mr Bhoyrul has been approached by Express Newspapers owner Richard Desmond to work for the Daily Star, but the job offer is dependent on the outcome of the DTI inquiry.",

      "bodyText": "Shell, Europe's largest oil company, yesterday put the issue of high petrol prices back on the political agenda by revealing an 85% increase in annual profits to $13.1bn (\u00a39.4bn) - more than \u00a31m an hour. The oil giant combined the announcement with a public relations offensive to head off criticism from the transport lobby over its biggest ever profits, which come just months after fuel protests crippled the country in the autumn. Shell insisted that it was making no money from selling fuel in Britain and instead blamed the government for high prices by saying that taxes accounted for 80% of the pump price. Malcolm Brinded, chairman of Shell UK, said his company had failed to make any money out of petrol retailing in Britain for six years, adding that 90% of group profits came from abroad. \"The story that can all too easily be written is the suggestion that we are making profits at the expense of the UK motorist because of what he pays at the pump. Nothing could be further from the truth,\" he added. Mr Brinded put record profits down to a mixture of higher oil prices, a leap in the amount of crude being produced by Shell's platforms and a high-profile company cost-cutting drive. Yesterday the price of North sea oil soared $1.25 to just under $30 per barrel, a level which promises to bring further gains to oil companies but which will anger motorists. The issue of petrol prices will be kept on the boil next week when BP reports its annual profit figures, which are expected to be 100% higher than last year. Despite the promise of even bigger profits, the oil companies claimed to be looking for even more savings. Shell's manager of UK retailing, Ian Sutcliffe, said things were getting so tough on the forecourt that it might have to make swingeing cutbacks. The group had already reduced the number of its petrol stations from 2,500 to 1,100 over the past 12 years and might consider disposing of all of them if it could not justify keeping them open. \"There are analogies with the loss of post offices in rural areas. Many petrol stations are only running because they combine selling fuel with acting as the village shop or motor repairer,\" he said. Criticism Shell was evaluating ways of reducing costs but planned to make a decision about the future of those interests within 18 months. It had already started a joint venture with the supermarket Sainsbury to try to improve profits through selling food and other non-fuel items on the forecourt. Mr Brinded also fought back against consumer criticism of the oil companies by pointing to the major contribution the group had made to the UK economy. He said that Shell employed 15,000 staff in the UK but its operations had a further 80,000 UK jobs dependent on it. Forty per cent of dividends from global earnings were paid to UK shareholders. In a move which reflects a new found public awareness, the formal release of Shell's annual financial figures was preceded by letters to motoring organisations and other \"stakeholders\" from Mr Brinded. The Shell executive said he was writing \"given that the financial performance of oil companies has been the subject of much media focus in the UK in recent months, particularly linking the profits of oil companies to the price of petrol at the pumps\". This was followed by a briefing at the Shell Tower headquarters yesterday where the UK chairman argued government taxes rather than oil company profits explained the high cost of fuel in the UK. He pointed out that 80% of the price of a litre of unleaded fuel was made up of tax and duty with only 6p per litre left over for refining, transportation and retail. He said that the high level of taxation had not been raised when oil companies were hauled before the prime minister during the fuel blockades. Then relations between government and the oil industry had hit rock bottom amid allegations that oil bosses had not put enough pressure on their staff to keep tankers moving through fuel blockades. Shell officials privately admitted yesterday they had not done enough to argue their case in public while executives from another oil company said they would try to avoid being tarnished with what was essentially a tax problem. The same line has been taken by ministers from the Organisation for Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) who say western governments are seeking to blame Arab oil producers in order to mask their own part in high pump prices. As Ali Rodriguez-Araque, Opec's new secretary-general, told the Spectator magazine this week: \"The irony is that they try to put pressure on us to reduce prices, but when prices drop, they don't drop taxes.\" But Shell's arguments about its poor returns in Britain were questioned by City experts. \"There are some advantages to low margins on the forecourt for integrated oil companies (which bring the oil from the ground as well as refining it and selling it on) because it can keep out the competition from independent retailers,\" said Peter Lynch, an oil analyst with US investment bank Merrill Lynch. Meanwhile the oil world is split on the question of whether the current high cost of oil is here to stay but all agree that they are going to remain \"volatile\". North sea prices averaged $28.50 per barrel last year compared with $17.95 in 1999. Shell believes that uncertainties over both economic growth and oil supply mean crude prices will continue to swing wildly. Slowdown Merrill Lynch warned that its long-term outlook last year was that oil prices would rise above their \"10-year historical average\". Some analysts argue that a US economic slowdown should reduce the price of crude over the coming year but experts have been constantly wrongfooted. Yesterday's burst in higher oil prices was partly triggered by freezing weather in the North sea which forced Norway to reduce its production. Shell was feeling the chill for different reasons.",

In the autumn of 1997, when the sheen of the new Labour government's surprisingly large electoral victory was still glimmering, one of the architects of that success, Mr Philip Gould, arrived at an internal strategy meeting flourishing the latest findings of one of his celebrated focus groups. It concerned the tricky question of the British public's view of membership of the European single currency.</p> <p>Mr Gould, the man usually described as the prime minister's favourite pollster, had ascertained that 40% of his representative sample were in favour of Britain joining the single currency while, perhaps unsurprisingly considering the acrimonious political debate that had taken place within the previous government in the run-up to the election, 60% were against.</p> <p>This news was received with equanimity by those present at the meeting. It was a result that was roughly in line with the known state of public opinion at the time. One man there reflected openly that it was as much as the government could have expected but, given the period of time that would elapse before the next election, the majority against was not insuperable. It could still be realistically possible, he suggested, to get public opinion lined up behind the government's support \"in principle\" for British membership and for there to be a majority in any referendum on the subject when the time came.</p> <p>He did not anticipate what happened next. Philip Gould looked at him and said: \"But we're not interested in getting them lined up with us. We're in the business of getting lined up with the 60%.\"</p> <p>It is a startling story which reveals rather a lot. It explains something about Mr Gould. It says a great deal about a government which the passage of time has repeatedly shown is almost always far more ready to react to any given political situation in preference to taking any other course. And it may also help to elucidate how it is that the current state of public opinion on the euro is so overwhelmingly negative. According to yesterday's publication of the latest eurobarometer poll, an analysis of opinion throughout all the member states, the figure for those in favour in Britain has nearly halved during the last three years and now stands at a record low of 21%, the lowest in the European Union.</p> <p>This is, it could be argued - whatever you think about a single currency - some measure of the success of Mr Gould in pursuit of his declared objective. If the government wished to identify with majority opinion in Britain on a single currency throughout Europe, the easiest course, and the one that it has certainly seemed to follow, would be to do exactly nothing. The voters were not interested in joining the euro and, anyway, there were plenty of other things for the government to get on with. The idea of an early referendum in the course of the current parliament was quickly ruled out. Presumably under direction from above, most ministers avoided public discussion of the subject and the government as a whole failed to engage in the debate.</p> <p>That didn't mean that a debate didn't take place, however, and by vacating the public platform, the Labour party left it open instead to a Eurosceptic Conservative party which in the populist pursuit of the lowest common denominator has succeeded in awakening even further a nationalistic hostility to all things European - except, of course, holidays, football and wine which don't count because they do not, as far as the British public is concerned, have a political dimension.</p> <p>But now the government has got a bit of a problem. There is clearly a growing recognition within the administration that whatever the state of public opinion, in the country's own interests Britain is going to have to join the single currency at some point. That was what lay behind the foreign secretary's interview this week in which Robin Cook optimistically asserted that a majority would vote in favour of the euro in a referendum. It may have sounded like a statement based more on optimism than political judgment, but Mr Cook is well aware that he spoke the truth: it is obvious that the government won't hold a referendum that it won't win.</p> <p>That was the significance, too, of Tony Blair's two-year timetable for reaching an assessment, at least, of the economic circumstances (which he announced deliberately at prime minister's questions on Wednesday). It was two years' notice of the fact that the British electorate is to be softened up for the eventual referendum to which the government is so inconveniently committed.</p> <p>But if any further compelling evidence was required that a change is under way, it comes from within the Treasury. There is a prevailing atmosphere of mild Euroscepticism among civil servants in the Treasury - one that is apparently scarcely different from the view held five years ago when the other lot were in office, and it has been given some encouragement by the approach of the present chancellor throughout his tenure.</p> <p>Now Gordon Brown has recently evinced a discernible change in his attitude. He has, for example, in the last few weeks for the first time responded positively to invitations with a European flavour and there has been some surprise at the fact that he has specifically expressed an interest in meeting visiting commissioners when they are in the country.</p> <p>It has been obvious to a large section of the business and industrial community for a very long time that there is little choice for the UK to remain a member of the European Union without joining the single currency, nor has there been much doubt that it will happen whenever the government decides for political reasons that the pressure has become irresistible. Several of the government's prominent business supporters are fiercely critical, nevertheless, about the way in which the government has failed to address the subject and about the lack of political foresight in its approach.</p> <p>Some explanation is provided by the anecdote about Philip Gould recited above, but perhaps Mr Blair would have done better to have paid more attention to a less cynical assessment Mr Gould offered in his invaluable work, The Unfinished Revolution.

Despite a year of job and production cuts at the British operations of several leading Japanese corporations, Mr Gomersall said that the European currency's recent rises and a clearer communication of London's position had eased concerns in Tokyo.</p> <p>\"Our impression is that, as the euro has firmed up and with the greater understanding of the complexity of the issues on the UK side, the level of concern expressed publicly by Japanese companies has abated considerably.\"</p> <p>Since his warning, the euro has gained significantly against the pound and the British government has reassured Japanese executives that they will not have to wait much longer for a decision on the single currency. Tony Blair added further clarification yesterday when he said that the question would be put to the electorate within two years of the next parliament if Labour wins the next election.</p> <p>Gomersall said Japanese businessmen continued to see the euro as a key factor in investment calculations, but that other issues were now in play. Japanese car manufacturers, such as Toyota and Honda, have learned to live with the strong pound by cutting costs and shifting the burden of foreign exchange fluctuations on to suppliers.</p> <p>\"The picture is tougher for suppliers. It would not be surprising if there is some reduction of UK content. That's inevitable, given the market,\" the ambassador said. He welcomed the decision earlier this month by Nissan to build its new Micra model at the company's plant in Sunderland - although the move was only made after managers promised to cut costs by 30% and the government offered a \u00a340bn grant.</p> <p>He noted, however, that the pattern of Japanese investment into Britain was shifting from lower paid manufacturing operations at economically depressed regions, such as South Wales, to high paid research facilities close to London or at universities. Last year, he said, Japanese companies cut 3,500 jobs from their combined UK workforce of 70,000. New research investments failed to fill the gap, creating only 1,000 to 2,000 jobs.</p>",

Despite a year of job and production cuts at the British operations of several leading Japanese corporations, Mr Gomersall said that the European currency's recent rises and a clearer communication of London's position had eased concerns in Tokyo. \"Our impression is that, as the euro has firmed up and with the greater understanding of the complexity of the issues on the UK side, the level of concern expressed publicly by Japanese companies has abated considerably.\" Since his warning, the euro has gained significantly against the pound and the British government has reassured Japanese executives that they will not have to wait much longer for a decision on the single currency. Tony Blair added further clarification yesterday when he said that the question would be put to the electorate within two years of the next parliament if Labour wins the next election. Gomersall said Japanese businessmen continued to see the euro as a key factor in investment calculations, but that other issues were now in play. Japanese car manufacturers, such as Toyota and Honda, have learned to live with the strong pound by cutting costs and shifting the burden of foreign exchange fluctuations on to suppliers. \"The picture is tougher for suppliers. It would not be surprising if there is some reduction of UK content. That's inevitable, given the market,\" the ambassador said. He welcomed the decision earlier this month by Nissan to build its new Micra model at the company's plant in Sunderland - although the move was only made after managers promised to cut costs by 30% and the government offered a \u00a340bn grant. He noted, however, that the pattern of Japanese investment into Britain was shifting from lower paid manufacturing operations at economically depressed regions, such as South Wales, to high paid research facilities close to London or at universities. Last year, he said, Japanese companies cut 3,500 jobs from their combined UK workforce of 70,000. New research investments failed to fill the gap, creating only 1,000 to 2,000 jobs.",

      "body": "<p>The appropriate word for Roy Andersson's new film, Songs From the Second Floor, is \"apocalyptic\". It is a surreal panorama of social collapse set in a chilly, cheerless world inhabited by pallid, ghost-like beings. Blank-faced tube commuters burst into angelic chorus; hosts of the dead are resurrected in a stretch of wasteland; rats scuttle across a deserted street. Lugubrious as these visions are, an absurdist comedy routine is never far away - almost Dave Allen-ish moments, like the sketch where a stage magician does his saw trick a little too effectively. For every glimpse of the abyss, a belly laugh. And all the time, the camera only moves once. </p> <p>When Andersson took Songs to Cannes last year, few people knew who this mystery outsider was, or why Lars von Trier had apparently mentioned him as the only Palme d'Or competitor he feared. In fact, for 25 years, Andersson had built a reputation as one of Scandinavia's leading commercials directors - the best in the world, according to Ingmar Bergman - and as a perfectionist who does things entirely on his own terms. When he visited London recently, I didn't know what kind of monster I was going to meet: a remote Scandinavian Kubrick, surely? </p> <p>But Andersson doesn't fit that image at all. He's a soft-spoken, stocky, middle-aged man with a red face and a denim shirt - a Roy through and through. Songs is nothing more or less than Andersson's personal statement on the human condition. He has been planning it since the early 1980s, when he discovered the lines by Peruvian poet Cesar Vallejo that run as a theme of universal benediction through the film. \"Originally,\" he says, \"the film was a mixture of two very different ideas. One was a very poetic, very simple film that I thought would be shot in an almost documentary style, based on the poem. But I also had another idea that was more polemical, satirical, political, and I managed to mix the two.\" </p> <p>The result is an eerie mix of the cartoonish and the spiritual. Andersson admits he is a religious film-maker, but only in the way that Bunuel was. \"He loved human beings and he loved people who are religious, but not priests. The Vallejo poem is almost religious in the sense that it's so respectful of vulnerable human beings. I'm not religious in the sense that I think we have connections to heaven, but I do have full respect for the Sermon on the Mount - 'Do to others as you would have them do to you.'\" </p> <p>Andersson's compassion doesn't stop him from turning his players into monstrous puppets, slouching around in a world with a colour palette reduced to grey and bilious yellow. Years ago, Andersson realised he \"was tired of pure realism - it got to the point where I'd have to stop and find another job, or try and develop the language of cinematography\". He found his new direction by looking to painting, especially Germans such as Otto Dix and Georg Grosz, and to the theatre of Beckett and Strindberg. Hence his characters' wraith-like make-up: \"I wanted them to be more universal than individuals. They represent us.\" </p> <p>In fact, Andersson's cast members are not actors playing faceless figures, but non-professionals who bring their physical peculiarities (pretty extreme peculiarities at that) to bulk out his dream world. Some of them are familiar to Swedish TV viewers as regulars in Andersson's commercials; nearly all are fished at random from Swedish society. They include a lawyer, a retired insurance clerk, and a former embassy chauffeur. The whale-like Lars Nordh, who plays a depressive businessman, was spotted shopping at Ikea; he's since become famous as a mean-spirited farmer in Andersson's dairy ads. </p> <p>\"I've been collecting characters for years,\" Andersson says. Recruiting, he admits, isn't always easy. \"You have to behave very respectfully. Sometimes I wonder how Fellini could get all those characters. We don't go as far as Fellini, but it's always a little hard to go up to people. I meet them in stores, restaurants, gas stations, and I also send out researchers. It's worse if you're not known, of course - especially if I were going up to young girls and saying, 'I'm in the film business.' It's always very delicate.\" </p> <p>If Andersson's people are real, their habitat isn't. Everything in Songs is the result of elaborate trompe l'oeil set-dressing - even a massive traffic jam is done in-house. Occasionally, he leaves his own Studio 24 for the real world, but always altering it. A scene in which thousands of onlookers gather at an outdoor ceremony of sacrifice is not the digital illusion we are used to - Andersson found it cheaper to hire a thousand extras, and then knock up another thousand out of plywood. The film's final scene alone, a long single shot, took over a month to set up: \"We even built the city in the distance - it's miniature, but three-dimensional.\" </p> <p>It isn't that Andersson is not interested in the real world. \"But to describe it, it's not certain that the best thing is to be realistic. Waiting for Godot says a lot about our time, but it's a timeless play. The characters are just talking gossip, nonsense, but at the same time they're talking about us.\" </p> <p>Andersson's perfectionism goes to extraordinary lengths. Rather than write scripts, he likes to \"sketch\" individual scenes by shooting 35mm tests for them, reworking them until he is satisfied. For one role in Songs, he tested 1,000 young actors, before changing the part entirely. So how did he become this monster of control? Very slowly, over more than a quarter-century. Even before graduating from film school, he had signed to make his first film in 1969, A Swedish Love Story, a lyrical teenage romance made under the influence of the Czech new wave; it has only hints of today's Andersson, but you can spot his touch in a demented chase through fog following a drunken night of crayfish-guzzling. </p> <p>That film was a major critical and commercial hit. His second, Giliap, made in 1975, was a flop that went over budget and made Andersson something of a pariah in Swedish cinema. It's a bizarre deadpan comedy about a hotel waiter that shows Andersson developing his particular gag style. Giliap left Andersson in debt, so he gladly accepted the offer to shoot commercials. His years of ads, especially one in 1985 for the leftwing Social Democrat party, let him develop a new style - punctiliously-timed sight gags, usually in single shots, and increasingly using his distinctively strange lighting, \"a light without mercy, where there was no possibility to escape or to hide - but in a soft way, naked\". </p> <p>The 25 years between his second and third features make Andersson cinema's champion absentee, beating even Terrence Malick and Victor Erice. That time also allowed him to set up his Studio 24, make two shorts (one of them a phenomenally depressing Aids information film) and to write a book called Our Fear of Seriousness in Our Time - \"about moral questions, arbitrariness, guilt, morals and art\". </p> <p>Andersson is big on seriousness. \"I felt it was not fair that painting should be regarded as visually richer than a movie. When I decided to be a director, it was the period of Wajda, Antonioni, Bunuel. Nowadays that seriousness is very rare. I try to work for that to come back. We have to get back the responsibility and respect for quality and seriousness.\" </p> <p>It's hard to reconcile such moral severity with the fact that Songs was scored by no less a Swedish pop icon than Abba's Benny Andersson (no relation) - admittedly, in a rather more sombre key than Fernando or Super Trouper. In fact, Andersson looks a little pained when I ask about the Abba connection. \"No, I knew him through his work with a Swedish painter. I was never an Abba fan. Though I admire some so-called riffs or fills.\" And he hums the cod-Rachmaninov piano frill from Dancing Queen. </p> <p>We may not have to wait another 25 years for Andersson's next film. He has two in mind, one of them an adaptation of C\u00e9line's sublimely misanthropic novel, Journey to the End of Night. In less than a year, Andersson's reputation has undergone a metamorphosis - he's now widely regarded as a world-class auteur, not just a superior commercials specialist. Mind you, someone who can sell insurance policies and yoghurt to Ingmar Bergman was always bound to be a force to reckon with. </p> <p>Songs From the Second Floor is released next Friday.</p>",

      "body": "<p>In 1961, when Truman Capote was considering an actress for the part of Holly Golightly in the film adaptation of his novel Breakfast at Tiffany's, Marilyn Monroe was his choice. But Paramount insisted on giving the part to Audrey Hepburn, the waifish former model who was far more in the style of Jackie Kennedy, the country's new first lady, than the troubled Hollywood star. </p> <p>Capote was dismayed by the choice, but Hepburn went on to make the role her own, so much so that her image in the movie - swept-up hair, little black dress - has come to evoke an entire era. Standing outside Tiffany's jewellery store in New York in the film's opening scene, impossibly soign\u00e9e in a sculpted evening gown, Hepburn represents both the elegance of the period and a sense of class barriers about to break down. Locked out of the shop, which has not yet started business for the day, Hepburn still manages to convey - as she does throughout the film - an unshakeable conviction that its doors will one day open for her.</p> <p>\"She's a phoney,\" says Martin Balsam, playing a visiting Hollywood agent who knows Golightly's secret small-town background, \"but she's a real phoney.\" The film is set in a time of optimism, two years before Jack Kennedy's assassination, and of innocence, just before the sexual revolution arrived to sweep away both its certainties and its paradoxes. </p> <p>Golightly seems like a girl on the make, a sophisticated New Yorker with her sights set on a rich husband. But through all the wild parties, she remains untouched, gradually revealing her true self to George Peppard, playing an impoverished author who has moved into the apartment upstairs. Hepburn lives on her own, in a stylish flat, but she inhabits a moment when a woman's career consists of a good marriage and virginity remains a unit of exchange. (Is Holly, as she appears to be in the film, a virgin? In one of its many ambiguities, she assures a bemused Peppard that her marriage to a Texan horse doctor was annulled rather than ending in divorce.) </p> <p>Holly may be brittle and sophisticated, but she is also unknowing, claiming not to realise that the \"weather reports\" she carries for a drug dealer in Sing Sing are coded messages to his accomplices. The movie relies heavily on her childlike screen presence to preserve the pristine sentimentality that lies beneath its couldn't-care-less facade. This is most evident in the final scene between Hepburn and an extremely wet (in both senses) Peppard, but it also emerges earlier in the film, when Hepburn climbs through a window in his apartment at four in the morning, escaping from an over-enthusiastic admirer, and finds him in bed. \"Do you mind if I just get in with you for a minute?\" she asks, snuggling up beside him. Peppard holds her like a child until she wakes in tears from a nightmare and exits through the same window.</p> <p> After a performance that appears to mistake dullness for reticence, and asexuality for inexperience, it isn't surprising that Peppard never made the leap into the major roles predicted for him. But the scene is striking for other reasons: one of them a sense of how differently Monroe would have played it, the other a realisation of the paradoxical qualities that made Hepburn a major star, but only briefly. </p> <p>Unlike Monroe and Doris Day - with whom she perhaps has more in common - Hepburn does not feature in Women in Film: an International Guide, the authoritative volume edited by the feminist critic Annette Kuhn, with Susannah Radstone. She is famous for a handful of movies, including My Fair Lady in 1964, but her film career was effectively over by 1968, when she divorced her first husband, the actor Mel Ferrer, and moved to Rome with her second, an Italian psychiatrist called Dr Andrea Dotti. A brief comeback in the 1970s produced only two movies, both of them undistinguished. Robin and Marian, in 1976, cast Hepburn improbably as Maid Marian in a medieval caper in which a middle-aged Robin Hood returns to Sherwood Forest after years in exile; and Bloodline, an adaptation in 1979 of a Sidney Sheldon novel, which was candidly described by one critic as \"unbearable\". </p> <p>A few more films followed in the 1980s, after her divorce from Dotti, but it seemed as thoughHepburn's heart was no longer in cinema. Towards the end of her life she lived with another actor, Robert Wolders, who shared her Dutch background, and threw herself into a new career as a roving ambassador for the UN children's agency, Unicef. When she died of colon cancer at her home in Switzerland in 1993, her first husband was a pall-bearer at her funeral, signalling her capacity for enduring friendship in an industry notorious for feuds and rivalries. </p> <p>What is not clear is whether Hepburn tired of cinema or whether she recognised, pragmatically, that she was too much of her era to enjoy a lengthy acting career. An exact contemporary of Jackie Kennedy - both were born to wealthy parents in 1929 - Hepburn's background was cosmopolitan. Born near Brussels, Edda Kathleen van Heemstra Hepburn-Ruston has often been described as Dutch because she grew up in the Netherlands with her parents, a Dutch baroness and an Anglo-Irish banker. Commenting on her gamine appearance, critics recalled that she spent her childhood in Nazi-occupied Holland, where food was in short supply and the family was sometimes reduced to eating tulip bulbs. </p> <p>Yet this ignores the fact that Hepburn began her modelling career as slenderness was becoming the order of the day; her willowy good looks were the precursor of a style that would, within a few years, be democratised by Twiggy and Jean Shrimpton. And even if Hepburn was perceived as having class, it was not in a straightforward way; Holly Golightly cheekily appropriates the manners of the rich in Breakfast at Tiffany's and Eliza Doolittle, three years later in My Fair Lady, has painfully to acquire them. This suggests that Hepburn's most important films are about reinvention, specifically what it means to be a woman, at a time of increasing gender insecurity. </p> <p>Unlike Monroe, only three years older but seeming to belong to an earlier generation, she does not use her sexuality in an overt way. The threat her beauty might pose is instead deflected by an emphasis on her infantile and androgynous qualities. \"It was a face beyond childhood, yet this side of belonging to a woman,\" Capote wrote of Golightly, perfectly capturing the yearnings and anxieties with which men were beginning to regard women shortly before the sexual revolution got going. </p> <p>Yet if Hepburn's screen persona represents an experiment in the modernisation of femininity, its limitations are also writ large - and not just because of its dependence on her youth. She had actually been around as an actress since the early 1950s, when she won an Oscar for Roman Holiday, and was 32 by the time she took on Holly Golightly; when she retired in 1968, aged 39, she may not have relished the character parts that would soon beckon in an incorrigibly ageist business. </p> <p> Yet there is also a sense in which Hepburn's onscreen modernity, like Holly Golightly's, was only skin-deep. Her trademark look, all sculpted hair, cigarette holder and picture hats, was the antithesis of the hippie d\u00e9shabill\u00e9 that came into fashion as the 1960s progressed. It was also, again like Golightly, essentially the product of a series of male constructions, principally the couturier Hubert de Givenchy, who dressed her for Breakfast at Tiffany's and came to regard her as something of a muse. It is here that the parallel with Jackie Kennedy becomes most insistent. At the beginning of the 1960s, the first lady and the Oscar-winning actress looked like a new type of woman: chic, daring, informal, breaking with postwar convention. Within a few years, the shallowness of that alteration would be exposed by a much more radical reappraisal of contemporary femininity, rethinking everything from the shape of women's underwear to the desirability of marriage. It marked the end of a brief, intoxicating phase in which women had been offered a new vision of themselves, only to discover it was mostly cosmetic. </p> <p>Hepburn herself, the most reticent of stars, may have been happy to step back and allow other actresses such as Julie Christie and Jane Fonda to carry on the experiment in movies such as Darling and Barbarella. Both these films - released in 1965 and 1968 respectively - are so quintessentially products of the nascent sexual revolution that they put Breakfast at Tiffany's, and its androgynous star, in their proper perspective. With her huge eyes and parted lips, Hepburn may have looked for a moment like the face of the 1960s. But, as the new print of Blake Edwards's film reveals, both she and the forces that created her belong firmly in the previous decade. </p> <p>It is perhaps this paradox that makes her perfect for nostalgic revivals. Hepburn's short heyday was on the cusp of two extraordinary decades, a social change which her teasing image - child-woman, both innocent and experienced - embodies. As a former model, she may have had more awareness than some of her contemporaries that her shelf-life was limited, leaving the screen by choice - unlike Monroe - before her audience became jaded. Never achieving superstar status, she also managed, as her perennial return to the fashion and arts pages confirms, to remain something of an enigma.</p> <p>Breakfast at Tiffany's is reissued next Friday.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In 1961, when Truman Capote was considering an actress for the part of Holly Golightly in the film adaptation of his novel Breakfast at Tiffany's, Marilyn Monroe was his choice. But Paramount insisted on giving the part to Audrey Hepburn, the waifish former model who was far more in the style of Jackie Kennedy, the country's new first lady, than the troubled Hollywood star. Capote was dismayed by the choice, but Hepburn went on to make the role her own, so much so that her image in the movie - swept-up hair, little black dress - has come to evoke an entire era. Standing outside Tiffany's jewellery store in New York in the film's opening scene, impossibly soign\u00e9e in a sculpted evening gown, Hepburn represents both the elegance of the period and a sense of class barriers about to break down. Locked out of the shop, which has not yet started business for the day, Hepburn still manages to convey - as she does throughout the film - an unshakeable conviction that its doors will one day open for her. \"She's a phoney,\" says Martin Balsam, playing a visiting Hollywood agent who knows Golightly's secret small-town background, \"but she's a real phoney.\" The film is set in a time of optimism, two years before Jack Kennedy's assassination, and of innocence, just before the sexual revolution arrived to sweep away both its certainties and its paradoxes. Golightly seems like a girl on the make, a sophisticated New Yorker with her sights set on a rich husband. But through all the wild parties, she remains untouched, gradually revealing her true self to George Peppard, playing an impoverished author who has moved into the apartment upstairs. Hepburn lives on her own, in a stylish flat, but she inhabits a moment when a woman's career consists of a good marriage and virginity remains a unit of exchange. (Is Holly, as she appears to be in the film, a virgin? In one of its many ambiguities, she assures a bemused Peppard that her marriage to a Texan horse doctor was annulled rather than ending in divorce.) Holly may be brittle and sophisticated, but she is also unknowing, claiming not to realise that the \"weather reports\" she carries for a drug dealer in Sing Sing are coded messages to his accomplices. The movie relies heavily on her childlike screen presence to preserve the pristine sentimentality that lies beneath its couldn't-care-less facade. This is most evident in the final scene between Hepburn and an extremely wet (in both senses) Peppard, but it also emerges earlier in the film, when Hepburn climbs through a window in his apartment at four in the morning, escaping from an over-enthusiastic admirer, and finds him in bed. \"Do you mind if I just get in with you for a minute?\" she asks, snuggling up beside him. Peppard holds her like a child until she wakes in tears from a nightmare and exits through the same window. After a performance that appears to mistake dullness for reticence, and asexuality for inexperience, it isn't surprising that Peppard never made the leap into the major roles predicted for him. But the scene is striking for other reasons: one of them a sense of how differently Monroe would have played it, the other a realisation of the paradoxical qualities that made Hepburn a major star, but only briefly. Unlike Monroe and Doris Day - with whom she perhaps has more in common - Hepburn does not feature in Women in Film: an International Guide, the authoritative volume edited by the feminist critic Annette Kuhn, with Susannah Radstone. She is famous for a handful of movies, including My Fair Lady in 1964, but her film career was effectively over by 1968, when she divorced her first husband, the actor Mel Ferrer, and moved to Rome with her second, an Italian psychiatrist called Dr Andrea Dotti. A brief comeback in the 1970s produced only two movies, both of them undistinguished. Robin and Marian, in 1976, cast Hepburn improbably as Maid Marian in a medieval caper in which a middle-aged Robin Hood returns to Sherwood Forest after years in exile; and Bloodline, an adaptation in 1979 of a Sidney Sheldon novel, which was candidly described by one critic as \"unbearable\". A few more films followed in the 1980s, after her divorce from Dotti, but it seemed as thoughHepburn's heart was no longer in cinema. Towards the end of her life she lived with another actor, Robert Wolders, who shared her Dutch background, and threw herself into a new career as a roving ambassador for the UN children's agency, Unicef. When she died of colon cancer at her home in Switzerland in 1993, her first husband was a pall-bearer at her funeral, signalling her capacity for enduring friendship in an industry notorious for feuds and rivalries. What is not clear is whether Hepburn tired of cinema or whether she recognised, pragmatically, that she was too much of her era to enjoy a lengthy acting career. An exact contemporary of Jackie Kennedy - both were born to wealthy parents in 1929 - Hepburn's background was cosmopolitan. Born near Brussels, Edda Kathleen van Heemstra Hepburn-Ruston has often been described as Dutch because she grew up in the Netherlands with her parents, a Dutch baroness and an Anglo-Irish banker. Commenting on her gamine appearance, critics recalled that she spent her childhood in Nazi-occupied Holland, where food was in short supply and the family was sometimes reduced to eating tulip bulbs. Yet this ignores the fact that Hepburn began her modelling career as slenderness was becoming the order of the day; her willowy good looks were the precursor of a style that would, within a few years, be democratised by Twiggy and Jean Shrimpton. And even if Hepburn was perceived as having class, it was not in a straightforward way; Holly Golightly cheekily appropriates the manners of the rich in Breakfast at Tiffany's and Eliza Doolittle, three years later in My Fair Lady, has painfully to acquire them. This suggests that Hepburn's most important films are about reinvention, specifically what it means to be a woman, at a time of increasing gender insecurity. Unlike Monroe, only three years older but seeming to belong to an earlier generation, she does not use her sexuality in an overt way. The threat her beauty might pose is instead deflected by an emphasis on her infantile and androgynous qualities. \"It was a face beyond childhood, yet this side of belonging to a woman,\" Capote wrote of Golightly, perfectly capturing the yearnings and anxieties with which men were beginning to regard women shortly before the sexual revolution got going. Yet if Hepburn's screen persona represents an experiment in the modernisation of femininity, its limitations are also writ large - and not just because of its dependence on her youth. She had actually been around as an actress since the early 1950s, when she won an Oscar for Roman Holiday, and was 32 by the time she took on Holly Golightly; when she retired in 1968, aged 39, she may not have relished the character parts that would soon beckon in an incorrigibly ageist business. Yet there is also a sense in which Hepburn's onscreen modernity, like Holly Golightly's, was only skin-deep. Her trademark look, all sculpted hair, cigarette holder and picture hats, was the antithesis of the hippie d\u00e9shabill\u00e9 that came into fashion as the 1960s progressed. It was also, again like Golightly, essentially the product of a series of male constructions, principally the couturier Hubert de Givenchy, who dressed her for Breakfast at Tiffany's and came to regard her as something of a muse. It is here that the parallel with Jackie Kennedy becomes most insistent. At the beginning of the 1960s, the first lady and the Oscar-winning actress looked like a new type of woman: chic, daring, informal, breaking with postwar convention. Within a few years, the shallowness of that alteration would be exposed by a much more radical reappraisal of contemporary femininity, rethinking everything from the shape of women's underwear to the desirability of marriage. It marked the end of a brief, intoxicating phase in which women had been offered a new vision of themselves, only to discover it was mostly cosmetic. Hepburn herself, the most reticent of stars, may have been happy to step back and allow other actresses such as Julie Christie and Jane Fonda to carry on the experiment in movies such as Darling and Barbarella. Both these films - released in 1965 and 1968 respectively - are so quintessentially products of the nascent sexual revolution that they put Breakfast at Tiffany's, and its androgynous star, in their proper perspective. With her huge eyes and parted lips, Hepburn may have looked for a moment like the face of the 1960s. But, as the new print of Blake Edwards's film reveals, both she and the forces that created her belong firmly in the previous decade. It is perhaps this paradox that makes her perfect for nostalgic revivals. Hepburn's short heyday was on the cusp of two extraordinary decades, a social change which her teasing image - child-woman, both innocent and experienced - embodies. As a former model, she may have had more awareness than some of her contemporaries that her shelf-life was limited, leaving the screen by choice - unlike Monroe - before her audience became jaded. Never achieving superstar status, she also managed, as her perennial return to the fashion and arts pages confirms, to remain something of an enigma. Breakfast at Tiffany's is reissued next Friday.",

The company said it was enjoying bumper sales from its leading names, which include Dove and Flora, but the reorganisation costs dragged it into the red by \u00db620m (\u00a3394m) in last year's final quarter. Chairman Niall FitzGerald - pictured above, right, with Peter Lack of Birdseye - insisted that the firm's \"path to growth\" programme, announced last year, was on track with sales of the top brands increasing by almost 5% at the end of 2000. He said the firm, which last year spent \u00db28bn on acquisitions such as SlimFast, Ben &amp; Jerry's ice-cream and Bestfoods, had cut the head count by over 5,000 and brands would be cut to 400 in four years. The past 12 months has also seen various disposals, including Elizabeth Arden and the Oxo and Batchelors operations. Underlying operating profits were up 16% at \u00db5.3bn, but exceptionals at the end of the year brought the full year pre-tax profits down 39% at \u00db2.6bn. The annual dividend was up 5% at 13.07p. The City's reaction, however, was low key, with shares falling 5p at 531p last night. This is well below the 590.5p year's high, but comfortably ahead of the 324p low. Analysts were pleased with the figures, but pointed out the 1.8% overall sales growth was fairly humble compared to rivals Danone and Nestl\u008e. \"They are pretty good numbers, but I would like to see them hurry up the divestments,\" one analyst said. Mr FitzGerald said the firm would launch 20 \"major initiatives\" over the coming year and was investing \u00a320m in Enjoy, its boil in the bag range which will also be sold in petrol stations and video shops. He also expects to complete the sale of Bestfood's fresh baked foods US business early next month.",

I also double-up as sports editor on the paper, so I had the darts and doms to cover, and the leagues for the kids' football, and Matlock are doing well in the FA trophy at the moment ... trivial things, but it brings you down to earth.</p> <p>There was already a bit of media build-up on Monday. The media interest this week has been tremendous. I've had camera crews in from all over the world, from Canada and Germany and Holland and the US. I've done interviews with Trevor McDonald and Channel 5.</p> <p>On Tuesday we were just trying to wrap things up as soon as possible so we could get away to London early on Tuesday night. Wednesday morning was going to be an early start because it was the day of the hearing and we had to be there by 9.30. The BBC was doing a fly-on-the-wall documentary with me, and they were filming from 4.30 on Wednesday morning, when I had to get up to do GMTV.</p> <p>I suppose it does put an extra stress and strain on you, when you're crossing your fingers that you've done everything you can, and they're watching which way you squeeze your toothpaste. And all the camera crew and everyone were ladies, which was a bit difficult to get used to, when you're getting changed and things.</p> <p>It was press day for the Matlock Mercury on Wednesday, too, and we had to get everything finished by lunchtime. We're only a small team, - a news editor and three reporters, and there's a lot to do. Marcus, one of our reporters, came down to London with me and he filed my copy. By the end of the day I had done 48 television and radio interviews.</p> <p>I felt pretty exhausted on Thursday, as if I'd got a hangover. I've not seen my wife, really, to speak to since Sunday - we've just been leaving messages on the fridge and speaking on the phone.</p> <p>It's a combination of emotions. I went up to see Stephen this morning. He said he had slept like a log. He had his first pint and a meal out last night. Of course he would like to be out, walking around the town, down by the river ... but it's not possible at the moment.</p> <p>The press have been camped outside his house, and mine. We've been besieged. When I went to the paper shop this morning, people were coming up to me, hugging and kissing me and saying, well done. It took me 40 minutes to buy a paper!</p> <p>It hasn't stopped all week. I've just been focusing on Stephen Downing and his case, really. His life becomes my life in a lot of ways.</p>",

There was already a bit of media build-up on Monday. The media interest this week has been tremendous. I've had camera crews in from all over the world, from Canada and Germany and Holland and the US. I've done interviews with Trevor McDonald and Channel 5. On Tuesday we were just trying to wrap things up as soon as possible so we could get away to London early on Tuesday night. Wednesday morning was going to be an early start because it was the day of the hearing and we had to be there by 9.30. The BBC was doing a fly-on-the-wall documentary with me, and they were filming from 4.30 on Wednesday morning, when I had to get up to do GMTV. I suppose it does put an extra stress and strain on you, when you're crossing your fingers that you've done everything you can, and they're watching which way you squeeze your toothpaste. And all the camera crew and everyone were ladies, which was a bit difficult to get used to, when you're getting changed and things. It was press day for the Matlock Mercury on Wednesday, too, and we had to get everything finished by lunchtime. We're only a small team, - a news editor and three reporters, and there's a lot to do. Marcus, one of our reporters, came down to London with me and he filed my copy. By the end of the day I had done 48 television and radio interviews. I felt pretty exhausted on Thursday, as if I'd got a hangover. I've not seen my wife, really, to speak to since Sunday - we've just been leaving messages on the fridge and speaking on the phone. It's a combination of emotions. I went up to see Stephen this morning. He said he had slept like a log. He had his first pint and a meal out last night. Of course he would like to be out, walking around the town, down by the river ... but it's not possible at the moment. The press have been camped outside his house, and mine. We've been besieged. When I went to the paper shop this morning, people were coming up to me, hugging and kissing me and saying, well done. It took me 40 minutes to buy a paper! It hasn't stopped all week. I've just been focusing on Stephen Downing and his case, really. His life becomes my life in a lot of ways.",

      "body": "<p>Customs and excise has lost \u00a3620m of revenue by bungling surveillance operations on professional criminals selling tax-free drink to pubs and clubs, a report by the national audit office reveals today.</p> <p>The revelation was described by David Davis, Tory chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, \"as the most serious breakdown in controls that we have witnessed\". The report reveals that over four years excise officers kept watch on gangs who were diverting huge amounts of wine, beer and spirits held in warehouses in Britain destined for export. But they never made arrests because they wanted to gather more information to prosecute them.</p> <p>By the time they acted they could only recover \u00a345m out of \u00a3668m - because the criminals had already sold the drink on the black market and it could no longer be traced.</p> <p>The scandal came at a time when alcohol smuggling was growing rapidly because of rising excise duties on drink and the ease with which large quantities could be brought into Britain through the \"white van\" trade from France and Belgium. But the bonded warehouse trade - where alcohol and tobacco are stored before being shipped abroad at ports - was not a priority for the excise officers.</p> <p>Thieves began targeting the warehouses because it provided bigger profits than smuggling lower duty-paid drink from France. There was also a growing market in clubs and pubs for cheap alcohol.</p> <p>Customs said yesterday that it took a long time to prosecute the gangs. A spokesman said it took months to bring one case to trial and involved prosecuting 97 people. Details of warehouses and gangs who got away have been sent in a secret internal report to ministers. The auditors are scathing that customs knew about the growing market in diverting drink bound for export to the home market but did nothing about it for such a long time.</p> <p>Sir John Bourn, the comptroller and auditor general, said: \"It is estimated that half of the revenue would not have been lost if customs had decided to intercept the fraudulent consignments, rather than seeking to obtain sufficient evidence to prosecute themselves by allowing the goods to be diverted to the home market and letting the investigations continue.\" The scandal came to light when the new head of customs and excise, ex-businessman Richard Broadbent found that some investigations had been mishandled. He immediately informed Dawn Primarolo, the paymaster-general, and set up an internal inquiry.</p> <p>Since then customs has tightened up its investigation procedures and an external inquiry is also investigating the mishandling of so many cases. The national audit office has now sent in a team of auditors to make a full report on the fiasco which will be presented to parliament later this year.</p> <p>Mr Davis said: \"Officials had been aware of the threat and scale of the fraud as early as 1994 but did not take effective action to curtail it until 1998. \"They took a further two years before ministers knew the scale of losses involved. This shows an astonishingly reckless disregard for the interests of the taxpayer and the attitude displayed to ministers and to parliament borders on contempt.\" A customs spokesman said they welcomed the auditors' decision to prepare a report for parliament.</p>",

The revelation was described by David Davis, Tory chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, \"as the most serious breakdown in controls that we have witnessed\". The report reveals that over four years excise officers kept watch on gangs who were diverting huge amounts of wine, beer and spirits held in warehouses in Britain destined for export. But they never made arrests because they wanted to gather more information to prosecute them. By the time they acted they could only recover \u00a345m out of \u00a3668m - because the criminals had already sold the drink on the black market and it could no longer be traced. The scandal came at a time when alcohol smuggling was growing rapidly because of rising excise duties on drink and the ease with which large quantities could be brought into Britain through the \"white van\" trade from France and Belgium. But the bonded warehouse trade - where alcohol and tobacco are stored before being shipped abroad at ports - was not a priority for the excise officers. Thieves began targeting the warehouses because it provided bigger profits than smuggling lower duty-paid drink from France. There was also a growing market in clubs and pubs for cheap alcohol. Customs said yesterday that it took a long time to prosecute the gangs. A spokesman said it took months to bring one case to trial and involved prosecuting 97 people. Details of warehouses and gangs who got away have been sent in a secret internal report to ministers. The auditors are scathing that customs knew about the growing market in diverting drink bound for export to the home market but did nothing about it for such a long time. Sir John Bourn, the comptroller and auditor general, said: \"It is estimated that half of the revenue would not have been lost if customs had decided to intercept the fraudulent consignments, rather than seeking to obtain sufficient evidence to prosecute themselves by allowing the goods to be diverted to the home market and letting the investigations continue.\" The scandal came to light when the new head of customs and excise, ex-businessman Richard Broadbent found that some investigations had been mishandled. He immediately informed Dawn Primarolo, the paymaster-general, and set up an internal inquiry. Since then customs has tightened up its investigation procedures and an external inquiry is also investigating the mishandling of so many cases. The national audit office has now sent in a team of auditors to make a full report on the fiasco which will be presented to parliament later this year. Mr Davis said: \"Officials had been aware of the threat and scale of the fraud as early as 1994 but did not take effective action to curtail it until 1998. \"They took a further two years before ministers knew the scale of losses involved. This shows an astonishingly reckless disregard for the interests of the taxpayer and the attitude displayed to ministers and to parliament borders on contempt.\" A customs spokesman said they welcomed the auditors' decision to prepare a report for parliament.",

      "body": "<p>The only person watching Clarice Starling more closely than Hannibal Lecter is director Ridley Scott. In a Los Angeles sound studio, Scott sits behind a console as the opening scene from his new movie, Hannibal, plays on a large screen across the room and on a nearby monitor. </p> <p>\"Pretty busy today,\" Starling mouths, via a hidden mike, to a fellow FBI agent at a fish market, where a sting operation is about to go tragically wrong. \"Pretty busy today,\" comes the simultaneous voice of Julianne Moore, talking in New York in a bicoastal looping session to ensure that the scene's background noises do not drown out her dialogue. Scott presses a lighted square on a little black box. \"That was good,\" he says. \"It's going to be quite loud. Project as much as you dare, considering what your face is doing.\" He takes his hand off the button and whispers, \"Can I get some coffee?\" as the footage is cued for replay. \"Pretty busy today,\" Moore says again. </p> <p>Sound technicians scrutinise the playback, making sure that the words match the lip movements, and give Scott a nod. For the next few hours, he will remain supremely attuned to the nuances of Starling's voice, the logic of her actions and the nature of her character. Everyone connected with Hannibal knows there is a lot at stake. Three months from now, Moore will appear before millions of fans who have waited 10 years to see Lecter and Starling play cat and mouse again.</p> <p> Italian is the first language spoken at Martha and Dino De Laurentiis's production office on the Universal lot in the Hollywood hills. Dino, the 81-year-old veteran of such films as La Strada, Ulysses and War and Peace, still speaks heavily accented English. He is a short man, sporting large, dark-rimmed glasses and a coral shirt under a tweed jacket. His wife and partner, 46-year-old Martha, sits beside him. Nearby, a dark, wooden desk big enough to roller-skate on is covered with awards. But today they are talking about the one that got away. </p> <p>In 1985, the couple bought the rights to Thomas Harris's bestselling thriller Red Dragon, from which they produced the 1986 movie Manhunter, directed by Michael Mann. The film, which features the first, brief screen appearance of the serial killer Hannibal Lecter (then spelled Lektor and played by Brian Cox), was inventive, frightening and well-received, but it grossed $8.6m, less than the cost of its print ads. The De Laurentiises were disappointed. \"Manhunter was not Red Dragon,\" Dino says. \"Manhunter was no good.\" And so when Harris completed The Silence of the Lambs, neither Dino nor Martha bothered to read it, even though they owned the screen rights to the Lecter character (who figured much more prominently in this new novel). \"Big mistake\" is how Dino now characterises this lack of interest.</p> <p> Harris and director Jonathan Demme came to him, wanting to set the project up elsewhere; Dino agreed and lent the now-defunct Orion Pictures the character of Hannibal Lecter - for free. \"We were afraid to make the movie,\" Martha explains. \"You could be terrible and say no, or you could demand money, which was kind of, 'Why be greedy?' Or you let them use it, and if it's successful, your asset has value.\" The Silence of the Lambs was released on February 14, 1991. It grossed $131m and received five Oscars, including best actor for Anthony Hopkins, best actress for Jodie Foster, and best picture. </p> <p>The De Laurentiises suddenly found themselves sitting on a valuable asset. Even before the movie came out, there was manoeuvring for a stake in a potential Silence sequel. Tom Pollock, then-chairman of Universal (and a former attorney who represented De Laurentiis during the making of Manhunter), asked Dino, who still controlled the Lecter character, to make any sequel at Universal. The De Laurentiises felt that Pollock was using other films they were partnering on as leverage for this request; Pollock felt they had reached an oral agreement to do the sequel. A conflict ensued, and the producers filed a $25m lawsuit against Universal. The parties ultimately settled; the studio got the participation it had wanted. </p> <p>All of this planning was still hypothetical, of course - Harris, a notoriously slow writer, was years away from finishing the next instalment. Every year, the eager De Laurentiises would fly down to Miami, with their personal chef in tow, and have dinner with Harris. (\"Tom is a great gourmand,\" Martha says.) \"Finally, I receive a call from Thomas,\" Dino recalls in his gravelly voice. \" 'Dino, I did it.' He finish.\" Hannibal picks up 10 years after Silence left off, with Lecter on the loose (he spends a chunk of time, to the De Laurentiises' delight, in Italy) and keeping a watchful eye on Clarice Starling - who will be used to smoke the serial killer out. </p> <p>The novel received mixed reviews but pushed Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets off the top of the best-seller list. Dino purchased the rights for a record $10m (\u00a36.9m). Before publication, the manuscript went out to Hopkins, Foster, and Demme, who had expressed interest in directing the sequel. Dino and Martha flew from Malta, where they were filming Universal's U-571, to New York to meet with Demme and begin structuring a deal. Later, however, Dino received a call from Demme's agent, CAA's Rick Nicita. \"He say to me, 'Dino, I have-a no good news for you. Jonathan Demme pass.' I say, 'Rick, when the Pope-a die, we create a new Pope-a. Good luck to Jonathan Demme. Good-bye.' \" </p> <p>It wasn't long before a new leader had been chosen. Ridley Scott (director of Blade Runner, Alien, Thelma &amp; Louise), who had worked with Dino briefly on 1984's Dune, was in Malta filming Gladiator next door to U-571. He invited Dino in for a cup of espresso. Five days later, Scottt recalls, Dino brought him \"a giant manuscript that said Hannibal\", which prompted the response: \"I said, 'Dino, I don't want to do elephants coming over the Alps. I'm doing a Roman movie now .' \" </p> <p>After reading the book (which features vicious boars rather than elephants), Scott accepted the job - although not without some hesitation. He had qualms about the ending, in which Clarice and Hannibal ride off amorously (and, to many readers, inconceivably) into the sunset. \"I couldn't take that quantum leap emotionally on behalf of Starling. Certainly, on behalf of Hannibal - I'm sure that's been in the back of his mind for a number of years. But for Starling, no. I think one of the attractions about Starling to Hannibal is what a straight arrow she is.\" Universal was also wary of the ending. \"I said to Dino: 'I'd really like to talk to Tom [Harris] to see how much licence we've got.' Tom said, 'Well, what would the interpretation be?' I said, 'I really don't know.' \" </p> <p>Untangling that meant hiring a screenwriter. Ted Tally, who'd won an Oscar for his Silence adaptation, turned down the sequel. An offer went out to Steven Zaillian, the writer of Schindler's List, who also turned it down. \"I was busy,\" Zaillian says. \"And I wasn't sure I was interested. You can almost never win when you do a sequel.\" David Mamet then wrote a version, but according to Scott and the De Laurentiises it needed major revisions. Dino and Scott went back to Zaillian, who was willing to reconsider at that point. \"I had found out that David Mamet was working on it,\" Zaillian says, \"and I started to feel like, What sort of a jerk am I? You know? Who am I?\" Besides, he adds, \"It's hard to say no to Dino once, and it's almost impossible to say no to him twice.\" </p> <p>Still, Zaillian would not commit to the project until the ending was resolved. Somehow, Dino convinced the reclusive Harris to fly to Los Angeles, where the author spent four days brainstorming with Scott and Zaillian in his hotel suite. \"Tom had said, 'I don't really do this, you know?'\" Scott recalls. \"But after four days of sitting around the table, his comment was, 'This has been really fun. I'll do this again.'\" Harris would remain closely involved with the project, even sending handwritten notes to Universal chairman Stacey Snider on issues like casting. </p> <p>\"I think the ending is more tonal as to what could possibly be in her mind at that moment,\" Scott says, shrugging and lighting a small cigar. \"He's quite specific. She is more enigmatic.\" The film, he adds, contains \"an interesting postscript, which, if nothing else, I think is fun. Some people think it's sick.\" The character of Clarice became an obsession for the entire production, for two reasons: first, when the De Laurentiises turned down the chance to make The Silence of the Lambs, they also passed on the rights to Clarice. To obtain them again, they had to go through MGM, which acquired Orion's properties after the company's demise. A co-production deal, including equal shares of the profits, was struck between Universal and MGM. </p> <p>The second problem was what Snider calls \"a hiccup with the casting\". As far as Lecter was concerned, \"everybody felt like there was nobody [but Anthony Hopkins] who could play him\", says Kevin Misher, Universal's president of production. The actor willingly came on board. \"I never thought a sequel would come up,\" Hopkins says. \"And then it did, and I thought, 'OK, fine, let's see what it's like.' I tend to be low-key about things like that.\" Hopkins had recently returned from a brief, self-imposed exile from Hollywood, following a trying experience making Titus. He read Harris's manuscript but formed no opinion of it. (\"I go into neutral. I don't make very much of things,\" he says.) Then he read the screenplay. \"I liked the script. I didn't know what the problem was. I said yes. It was as simple and matter-of-fact as that. It's a living. It's just work.\" This is the kind of work, however, that would net him $11m in salary alone. </p> <p>Foster reacted very differently. (She declined to be interviewed for this story.) Some say she had sequelitis. Others contend that she either disliked the book, didn't want to do it without Demme and/or was slated to direct another film. A final possibility is that when she saw the film's profits already being divided up between Harris, Dino, Hopkins, and Scott, it got her back up. \"I call the agent of Judy Foster,\" recalls Dino, who comically mispronounces the actress's name. \"He say to me, 'I have instruction. She no want to read the script if you no give her an offer of $20m and 15% of the gross.' And I say, 'Give my love to Judy Foster, goodbye.' That's a crazy demand.\" Besides, he says, \"I don't believe Judy Foster from day one was right when I read the book.\" </p> <p>Universal took Foster's decision much harder. \"We went back to her, like you go back to any actor who has passed, and said, 'Come on, this is Clarice Starling. This is the character that really was yours,'\" Misher says. Scott, who worked with the actress in the early 1990s, spoke with her too, but to no avail. Hopkins stayed out of it. \"I think actors who get involved in that stuff must need a good psychoanalysis,\" he says. \"Just give me my plane ticket, and I'll show up. I keep my life much simpler that way.\" Misher says: \"It was one of those moments when you sit down and think, 'Can Clarice be looked upon as James Bond, for instance? A character who is replaceable? Or was Jodie Foster Clarice Starling, and the audience will not accept anyone else?'\" </p> <p>To find out, Universal quietly floated the possibility around town, and soon several A-list actresses (Cate Blanchett, Angelina Jolie, Hilary Swank, Ashley Judd and Julianne Moore) had shown interest. \"I think it emboldened us,\" Misher says. Moore quickly rose to the top of the list. She was someone with \"impeccable credentials who was also a star,\" Misher says. \"She was kind of it,\" adds Scott. Before offering her the role, however, Scott consulted Hopkins, because the franchise \"was more his than mine. He said, 'Oh, yes. Jolly good.' \" </p> <p>Moore was hired for a reported $3m. Even the internet rabble-rousers seemed pleased. Scott considers her a fitting successor to Foster, seeing in her \"a certain kind of gravitas, an intelligence, which is very similar. But you know, honestly, most good actors are really smart. Some producers will say that's nonsense,\" he adds with a chuckle. \"No. I've got to work with them.\" </p> <p>Lecter's mind may be a creepy place, but Hopkins had no trouble moving back into it. \"I just learned the lines and showed up and walked around as Hannibal Lecter,\" he says. The actor did, however, pop in a tape of Silence before shooting began. \"I thought, 'Do I repeat that performance, or do I vary it?' Ten years had passed, so I changed it a bit. Because I've changed.\" Today's Hannibal is \"a bit mellower\", Hopkins says. \"He's probably a much richer character.\" Rivalling Lecter in the villainy department is Mason Verger, a paedophile and the only one of Hannibal the Cannibal's victims who remains alive (though not quite intact). Verger uses his enormous wealth to search for Lecter and plot a gory revenge. The role required hours of prosthetic make-up, and Scott found his man in the chameleon-like Gary Oldman. </p> <p>\"We had a funny situation with Gary,\" Martha De Laurentiis says. \"He wanted a prominent credit. Now, how can you do a prominent credit with Hannibal? The characters are Hannibal and Clarice Starling. So we really couldn't work something out [at first].\" For a while Oldman was out, then he came back, asking to go unbilled. His casting was announced by Dino at a press conference in Florence just before the start of shooting, \"so we couldn't deny that he was in the movie\", Martha says. \"They [Oldman and his camp] got really pissed off. And to have a pissed-off actor . . .\" She changes tone abruptly. \"You'll have to see the film to see if it's Gary Oldman or not.\" (Oldman's manager declined to comment.) </p> <p>Even then, audiences might not recognise the actor. Oldman has been completely transformed, thanks to a translucent silicone that make-up artist Greg Cannom says he and his associate, Wesley Wofford, invented for Bicentennial Man. \"I knew we could get away with more with him than some other actor,\" says Cannom. \"The first thing he said was, 'Can we stretch my eye open?' \" No lips, no cheeks, no eyelids. \"It's really disgusting,\" Cannom says. \"I've been showing people pictures [of Oldman as Verger], and they all just say, 'Oh my God,' and walk away, which makes me very happy.\" </p> <p>Verger wants Lecter dead. Most of all, he wants to watch him suffer. To this purpose, he has been breeding an especially vicious pack of wild pigs, \"hip-high to a man,\" Thomas Harris writes, \"intelligent little eyes in their hellish faces . . . capable of lifting a man on their great, ripping tusks.\" Animal coordinator Sled Reynolds looked at more than 6,000 pigs across North America before finding what he calls \"the biggest ones I could\", more than a dozen 350-600lb breeding boars from a Canadian dealer. After a quarantine, the tusked, long-haired beasts, with teeth four or five inches long, arrived to train with Reynolds on his California ranch. \"They're supposed to look very violent and mean, but they're also supposed to stand around in a crew of 150 people and have Gary Oldman lying among them and not eat him,\" Reynolds says. \"So, obviously, their aggression has to be trained.\" </p> <p>He quickly discovered the animals to be very intelligent. \"I really grew fond of the little buggers.\" Cinematographer John Mathieson says the \"rather charming\" creatures would \"come up and wipe their noses on the cameras and get pig schnoz all over the front.\" One \"particularly nasty\" task was left to an animatronic boar, which \"grabbed [a dummy's] face and ripped it right off,\" Cannom says. \"The other one grabbed his entrails. People were getting sick. I don't think they will show much of that.\" Another of the movie's stomach-turning set pieces involves a cosy dinner that Hannibal arranges for himself, Clarice, and her justice department nemesis, Paul Krendler (Ray Liotta). </p> <p>\"He has the opportunity and the know-how to make [Starling's] life miserable,\" Liotta says of Krendler, \"so that's what he does.\" Liotta used a little know-how of his own to nab the role: he caught Scott off-guard at a gym in Los Angeles before production began. \"He was walking out,\" Liotta recalls, \"and, like two or three movies that I've gotten, I just went up to him and said, 'I'd love to work with you.' \" \"That worked,\" Scott says, still amused by Liotta's tactic. \"I was struggling at the gym and he was sitting on a bicycle, reading a newspaper. I had never met him, but I knew he knew who I was. I was walking out to the car park and he said, 'I know what you're doing. Is there anything in there for me?' I thought about it and said, 'Well, why not?' \" </p> <p>A $70,000 animatronic dummy of Liotta was created for the climactic dinner scene, giving the actor an unusual opportunity to stand off-camera and watch himself acting. Liotta, who endured a full head and body cast and shaved his head for the role, says he had a ball playing someone who's \"filled with drugs, yet is still awake while all this is happening. I think people will definitely remember this scene.\" Those who've read the book certainly do. But even they may be in for a surprise. \"If anything, it's more explicit than in the book,\" he says. </p> <p>I t's the morning after Halloween. Taped to the door of an editing room is a reduced copy of the Hannibal poster, which has been doctored with a strip of paper near Hopkins's mouth that reads: TRICK OR TREAT. DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING I CAN EAT? Ridley Scott emerges from a chat with editor Pietro Scalia and Dino De Laurentiis and goes right into a meeting with members of a Manhattan design studio, who've come to pitch ideas for the film's opening title sequence. They present Scott with storyboards offering a tour through the chambers of Lecter's mind and discuss using the aptly named type font Chianti. Scott seems pleased but warns against making the sequence \"whimsically gothic\". He suggests that instead of music - or in addition to it - the journey could be accompanied by \"the sound you get from blood when it moves through the vein\" or \"old secrets whispered over books\". </p> <p>Scott may not be quite through with Hannibal Lecter yet. The De Laurentiises have announced plans to capitalise on their investment by remaking Red Dragon at Universal; the studio's Stacey Snider says it will include new, Lecter-related plot lines. It is very unusual for a contemporary novel to be made into a movie twice within 20 years. Michael Mann, who directed the original 1986 version, declined to be interviewed. \"Mann was informed that we were doing this,\" Snider says. \"We didn't want to be disrespectful of his earlier work.\" Many directors, she adds, have raised their hands for the job, and \"I'm sure Dino spoke to Ridley. They're very close.\" </p> <p>Hopkins, who has verbally agreed to play a cameo, is waiting to see the script, by Lambs writer Ted Tally, which is due to be delivered to Universal this month. He is delighted and surprised by Lecter's continuing appeal. \"He seems to be a popular cult figure,\" says Hopkins. \"I don't know if that makes the whole of the world crazy, but . . . there are dark sides to human nature.\" </p> <p>From Premiere magazine. \u00a9 2000, Hachette Filipacchi magazines.

      "bodyText": "The only person watching Clarice Starling more closely than Hannibal Lecter is director Ridley Scott. In a Los Angeles sound studio, Scott sits behind a console as the opening scene from his new movie, Hannibal, plays on a large screen across the room and on a nearby monitor. \"Pretty busy today,\" Starling mouths, via a hidden mike, to a fellow FBI agent at a fish market, where a sting operation is about to go tragically wrong. \"Pretty busy today,\" comes the simultaneous voice of Julianne Moore, talking in New York in a bicoastal looping session to ensure that the scene's background noises do not drown out her dialogue. Scott presses a lighted square on a little black box. \"That was good,\" he says. \"It's going to be quite loud. Project as much as you dare, considering what your face is doing.\" He takes his hand off the button and whispers, \"Can I get some coffee?\" as the footage is cued for replay. \"Pretty busy today,\" Moore says again. Sound technicians scrutinise the playback, making sure that the words match the lip movements, and give Scott a nod. For the next few hours, he will remain supremely attuned to the nuances of Starling's voice, the logic of her actions and the nature of her character. Everyone connected with Hannibal knows there is a lot at stake. Three months from now, Moore will appear before millions of fans who have waited 10 years to see Lecter and Starling play cat and mouse again. Italian is the first language spoken at Martha and Dino De Laurentiis's production office on the Universal lot in the Hollywood hills. Dino, the 81-year-old veteran of such films as La Strada, Ulysses and War and Peace, still speaks heavily accented English. He is a short man, sporting large, dark-rimmed glasses and a coral shirt under a tweed jacket. His wife and partner, 46-year-old Martha, sits beside him. Nearby, a dark, wooden desk big enough to roller-skate on is covered with awards. But today they are talking about the one that got away. In 1985, the couple bought the rights to Thomas Harris's bestselling thriller Red Dragon, from which they produced the 1986 movie Manhunter, directed by Michael Mann. The film, which features the first, brief screen appearance of the serial killer Hannibal Lecter (then spelled Lektor and played by Brian Cox), was inventive, frightening and well-received, but it grossed $8.6m, less than the cost of its print ads. The De Laurentiises were disappointed. \"Manhunter was not Red Dragon,\" Dino says. \"Manhunter was no good.\" And so when Harris completed The Silence of the Lambs, neither Dino nor Martha bothered to read it, even though they owned the screen rights to the Lecter character (who figured much more prominently in this new novel). \"Big mistake\" is how Dino now characterises this lack of interest. Harris and director Jonathan Demme came to him, wanting to set the project up elsewhere; Dino agreed and lent the now-defunct Orion Pictures the character of Hannibal Lecter - for free. \"We were afraid to make the movie,\" Martha explains. \"You could be terrible and say no, or you could demand money, which was kind of, 'Why be greedy?' Or you let them use it, and if it's successful, your asset has value.\" The Silence of the Lambs was released on February 14, 1991. It grossed $131m and received five Oscars, including best actor for Anthony Hopkins, best actress for Jodie Foster, and best picture. The De Laurentiises suddenly found themselves sitting on a valuable asset. Even before the movie came out, there was manoeuvring for a stake in a potential Silence sequel. Tom Pollock, then-chairman of Universal (and a former attorney who represented De Laurentiis during the making of Manhunter), asked Dino, who still controlled the Lecter character, to make any sequel at Universal. The De Laurentiises felt that Pollock was using other films they were partnering on as leverage for this request; Pollock felt they had reached an oral agreement to do the sequel. A conflict ensued, and the producers filed a $25m lawsuit against Universal. The parties ultimately settled; the studio got the participation it had wanted. All of this planning was still hypothetical, of course - Harris, a notoriously slow writer, was years away from finishing the next instalment. Every year, the eager De Laurentiises would fly down to Miami, with their personal chef in tow, and have dinner with Harris. (\"Tom is a great gourmand,\" Martha says.) \"Finally, I receive a call from Thomas,\" Dino recalls in his gravelly voice. \" 'Dino, I did it.' He finish.\" Hannibal picks up 10 years after Silence left off, with Lecter on the loose (he spends a chunk of time, to the De Laurentiises' delight, in Italy) and keeping a watchful eye on Clarice Starling - who will be used to smoke the serial killer out. The novel received mixed reviews but pushed Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets off the top of the best-seller list. Dino purchased the rights for a record $10m (\u00a36.9m). Before publication, the manuscript went out to Hopkins, Foster, and Demme, who had expressed interest in directing the sequel. Dino and Martha flew from Malta, where they were filming Universal's U-571, to New York to meet with Demme and begin structuring a deal. Later, however, Dino received a call from Demme's agent, CAA's Rick Nicita. \"He say to me, 'Dino, I have-a no good news for you. Jonathan Demme pass.' I say, 'Rick, when the Pope-a die, we create a new Pope-a. Good luck to Jonathan Demme. Good-bye.' \" It wasn't long before a new leader had been chosen. Ridley Scott (director of Blade Runner, Alien, Thelma &amp; Louise), who had worked with Dino briefly on 1984's Dune, was in Malta filming Gladiator next door to U-571. He invited Dino in for a cup of espresso. Five days later, Scottt recalls, Dino brought him \"a giant manuscript that said Hannibal\", which prompted the response: \"I said, 'Dino, I don't want to do elephants coming over the Alps. I'm doing a Roman movie now .' \" After reading the book (which features vicious boars rather than elephants), Scott accepted the job - although not without some hesitation. He had qualms about the ending, in which Clarice and Hannibal ride off amorously (and, to many readers, inconceivably) into the sunset. \"I couldn't take that quantum leap emotionally on behalf of Starling. Certainly, on behalf of Hannibal - I'm sure that's been in the back of his mind for a number of years. But for Starling, no. I think one of the attractions about Starling to Hannibal is what a straight arrow she is.\" Universal was also wary of the ending. \"I said to Dino: 'I'd really like to talk to Tom [Harris] to see how much licence we've got.' Tom said, 'Well, what would the interpretation be?' I said, 'I really don't know.' \" Untangling that meant hiring a screenwriter. Ted Tally, who'd won an Oscar for his Silence adaptation, turned down the sequel. An offer went out to Steven Zaillian, the writer of Schindler's List, who also turned it down. \"I was busy,\" Zaillian says. \"And I wasn't sure I was interested. You can almost never win when you do a sequel.\" David Mamet then wrote a version, but according to Scott and the De Laurentiises it needed major revisions. Dino and Scott went back to Zaillian, who was willing to reconsider at that point. \"I had found out that David Mamet was working on it,\" Zaillian says, \"and I started to feel like, What sort of a jerk am I? You know? Who am I?\" Besides, he adds, \"It's hard to say no to Dino once, and it's almost impossible to say no to him twice.\" Still, Zaillian would not commit to the project until the ending was resolved. Somehow, Dino convinced the reclusive Harris to fly to Los Angeles, where the author spent four days brainstorming with Scott and Zaillian in his hotel suite. \"Tom had said, 'I don't really do this, you know?'\" Scott recalls. \"But after four days of sitting around the table, his comment was, 'This has been really fun. I'll do this again.'\" Harris would remain closely involved with the project, even sending handwritten notes to Universal chairman Stacey Snider on issues like casting. \"I think the ending is more tonal as to what could possibly be in her mind at that moment,\" Scott says, shrugging and lighting a small cigar. \"He's quite specific. She is more enigmatic.\" The film, he adds, contains \"an interesting postscript, which, if nothing else, I think is fun. Some people think it's sick.\" The character of Clarice became an obsession for the entire production, for two reasons: first, when the De Laurentiises turned down the chance to make The Silence of the Lambs, they also passed on the rights to Clarice. To obtain them again, they had to go through MGM, which acquired Orion's properties after the company's demise. A co-production deal, including equal shares of the profits, was struck between Universal and MGM. The second problem was what Snider calls \"a hiccup with the casting\". As far as Lecter was concerned, \"everybody felt like there was nobody [but Anthony Hopkins] who could play him\", says Kevin Misher, Universal's president of production. The actor willingly came on board. \"I never thought a sequel would come up,\" Hopkins says. \"And then it did, and I thought, 'OK, fine, let's see what it's like.' I tend to be low-key about things like that.\" Hopkins had recently returned from a brief, self-imposed exile from Hollywood, following a trying experience making Titus. He read Harris's manuscript but formed no opinion of it. (\"I go into neutral. I don't make very much of things,\" he says.) Then he read the screenplay. \"I liked the script. I didn't know what the problem was. I said yes. It was as simple and matter-of-fact as that. It's a living. It's just work.\" This is the kind of work, however, that would net him $11m in salary alone. Foster reacted very differently. (She declined to be interviewed for this story.) Some say she had sequelitis. Others contend that she either disliked the book, didn't want to do it without Demme and/or was slated to direct another film. A final possibility is that when she saw the film's profits already being divided up between Harris, Dino, Hopkins, and Scott, it got her back up. \"I call the agent of Judy Foster,\" recalls Dino, who comically mispronounces the actress's name. \"He say to me, 'I have instruction. She no want to read the script if you no give her an offer of $20m and 15% of the gross.' And I say, 'Give my love to Judy Foster, goodbye.' That's a crazy demand.\" Besides, he says, \"I don't believe Judy Foster from day one was right when I read the book.\" Universal took Foster's decision much harder. \"We went back to her, like you go back to any actor who has passed, and said, 'Come on, this is Clarice Starling. This is the character that really was yours,'\" Misher says. Scott, who worked with the actress in the early 1990s, spoke with her too, but to no avail. Hopkins stayed out of it. \"I think actors who get involved in that stuff must need a good psychoanalysis,\" he says. \"Just give me my plane ticket, and I'll show up. I keep my life much simpler that way.\" Misher says: \"It was one of those moments when you sit down and think, 'Can Clarice be looked upon as James Bond, for instance? A character who is replaceable? Or was Jodie Foster Clarice Starling, and the audience will not accept anyone else?'\" To find out, Universal quietly floated the possibility around town, and soon several A-list actresses (Cate Blanchett, Angelina Jolie, Hilary Swank, Ashley Judd and Julianne Moore) had shown interest. \"I think it emboldened us,\" Misher says. Moore quickly rose to the top of the list. She was someone with \"impeccable credentials who was also a star,\" Misher says. \"She was kind of it,\" adds Scott. Before offering her the role, however, Scott consulted Hopkins, because the franchise \"was more his than mine. He said, 'Oh, yes. Jolly good.' \" Moore was hired for a reported $3m. Even the internet rabble-rousers seemed pleased. Scott considers her a fitting successor to Foster, seeing in her \"a certain kind of gravitas, an intelligence, which is very similar. But you know, honestly, most good actors are really smart. Some producers will say that's nonsense,\" he adds with a chuckle. \"No. I've got to work with them.\" Lecter's mind may be a creepy place, but Hopkins had no trouble moving back into it. \"I just learned the lines and showed up and walked around as Hannibal Lecter,\" he says. The actor did, however, pop in a tape of Silence before shooting began. \"I thought, 'Do I repeat that performance, or do I vary it?' Ten years had passed, so I changed it a bit. Because I've changed.\" Today's Hannibal is \"a bit mellower\", Hopkins says. \"He's probably a much richer character.\" Rivalling Lecter in the villainy department is Mason Verger, a paedophile and the only one of Hannibal the Cannibal's victims who remains alive (though not quite intact). Verger uses his enormous wealth to search for Lecter and plot a gory revenge. The role required hours of prosthetic make-up, and Scott found his man in the chameleon-like Gary Oldman. \"We had a funny situation with Gary,\" Martha De Laurentiis says. \"He wanted a prominent credit. Now, how can you do a prominent credit with Hannibal? The characters are Hannibal and Clarice Starling. So we really couldn't work something out [at first].\" For a while Oldman was out, then he came back, asking to go unbilled. His casting was announced by Dino at a press conference in Florence just before the start of shooting, \"so we couldn't deny that he was in the movie\", Martha says. \"They [Oldman and his camp] got really pissed off.

Oldman has been completely transformed, thanks to a translucent silicone that make-up artist Greg Cannom says he and his associate, Wesley Wofford, invented for Bicentennial Man. \"I knew we could get away with more with him than some other actor,\" says Cannom. \"The first thing he said was, 'Can we stretch my eye open?' \" No lips, no cheeks, no eyelids. \"It's really disgusting,\" Cannom says. \"I've been showing people pictures [of Oldman as Verger], and they all just say, 'Oh my God,' and walk away, which makes me very happy.\" Verger wants Lecter dead. Most of all, he wants to watch him suffer. To this purpose, he has been breeding an especially vicious pack of wild pigs, \"hip-high to a man,\" Thomas Harris writes, \"intelligent little eyes in their hellish faces . . . capable of lifting a man on their great, ripping tusks.\" Animal coordinator Sled Reynolds looked at more than 6,000 pigs across North America before finding what he calls \"the biggest ones I could\", more than a dozen 350-600lb breeding boars from a Canadian dealer. After a quarantine, the tusked, long-haired beasts, with teeth four or five inches long, arrived to train with Reynolds on his California ranch. \"They're supposed to look very violent and mean, but they're also supposed to stand around in a crew of 150 people and have Gary Oldman lying among them and not eat him,\" Reynolds says. \"So, obviously, their aggression has to be trained.\" He quickly discovered the animals to be very intelligent. \"I really grew fond of the little buggers.\" Cinematographer John Mathieson says the \"rather charming\" creatures would \"come up and wipe their noses on the cameras and get pig schnoz all over the front.\" One \"particularly nasty\" task was left to an animatronic boar, which \"grabbed [a dummy's] face and ripped it right off,\" Cannom says. \"The other one grabbed his entrails. People were getting sick. I don't think they will show much of that.\" Another of the movie's stomach-turning set pieces involves a cosy dinner that Hannibal arranges for himself, Clarice, and her justice department nemesis, Paul Krendler (Ray Liotta). \"He has the opportunity and the know-how to make [Starling's] life miserable,\" Liotta says of Krendler, \"so that's what he does.\" Liotta used a little know-how of his own to nab the role: he caught Scott off-guard at a gym in Los Angeles before production began. \"He was walking out,\" Liotta recalls, \"and, like two or three movies that I've gotten, I just went up to him and said, 'I'd love to work with you.' \" \"That worked,\" Scott says, still amused by Liotta's tactic. \"I was struggling at the gym and he was sitting on a bicycle, reading a newspaper. I had never met him, but I knew he knew who I was. I was walking out to the car park and he said, 'I know what you're doing. Is there anything in there for me?' I thought about it and said, 'Well, why not?' \" A $70,000 animatronic dummy of Liotta was created for the climactic dinner scene, giving the actor an unusual opportunity to stand off-camera and watch himself acting. Liotta, who endured a full head and body cast and shaved his head for the role, says he had a ball playing someone who's \"filled with drugs, yet is still awake while all this is happening. I think people will definitely remember this scene.\" Those who've read the book certainly do. But even they may be in for a surprise. \"If anything, it's more explicit than in the book,\" he says.

      "bodyText": "Jewellers have been having a sparkling time recently and Signet, the company formerly known as Ratners, is no exception. The shares rose 2.25p to a year's high of 71p yesterday following news of a good Christmas performance. Overall like-for-like sales for the year rose 6.8% and underlying sales for the fourth quarter were up 3.3%. Signet's US operation has the largest turnover per store among American multiple jewellers, and the UK side of the group - the H Samuel and Ernest Jones stores - saw an underlying rise of 7.9% on like-for-like sales in the 13 weeks to the end of January. Over the last 10 years the company has been turned around and brought back from the brink of near bankruptcy. The US portfolio has been upgraded and the management team has kept a handle on the finances and been able to sit back and watch people buy jewellery in a strong economy. Terry Burman, Signet's chief executive, was upbeat about the results for the year. \"During the quarter the US business demonstrated resilience and increased market share, against the background of a marked slowdown in the economy.\" But here lies the problem for the company. The US economy is heading for a slowdown if not outright recession, and so the future might not be quite as bright. The 1,604 specialist retail jewellery stores Signet operates - particularly the 999 in the US - might not be the popular destinations they have been in the recent past. Indeed, there are already signs that sales may be starting to be affected. The company's US shops, which have traditionally been the strongest part of the business and which accounted for 70.7% of the total sales for the fourth quarter saw like-for-like sales rise by just 1.1%. With growing concerns about the economic climate in the US, the company's recent strength may not continue. The shares are no more than a hold.",

During a 20-year connection with Yorkshire Television, dating from the station's first day in 1968, he brought the character of the county's lonely places, and the people determined to live and work in them, to an enormous audience.</p> <p>Cockroft was always known as \"Dino\" to colleagues, because of his love of grand, sweeping shots which suggested that Ben-Hur's chariot or Lawrence of Arabia's camels might suddenly appear in Upper Wensleydale or along the Tees. The tag was coined on his first foreign outing for YTV - actually the first travel \"freebie\" ever offered to the station - to Rome, where Dino de Laurentiis was filming Monte Carlo or Bust. Cockroft came back with a bagful of neat, brief films (notably one on variations in the price of his beloved cappuccino), plus the nickname, which stuck.</p> <p>Like many of the canniest observers of distinctive places, he was actually an outsider - a Lancastrian from Rochdale, who started work as a teenage proof-reader on the Rochdale Observer, but soon found work as a reporter and feature writer. Writing remained a lifelong talent; after moving to the Manchester office of the News Chronicle and then the local Evening Chronicle (both of which closed under him), he wrote scripts for Coronation Street. His best TV documentaries were always accompanied by well-written, linked books.</p> <p>His strong visual sense, however, took him from print journalism to Granada TV, where brief documentary films for the local opt-out, Scene at 6.30, attracted attention. He jumped at the chance to join YTV's brave new venture in Leeds, initially recruited by Donald Baverstock to work on Scene's Yorkshire equivalent, Calendar. Cockroft was soon in demand as a director for grander projects, and his cheerful delight in good food and wine was fuelled by trips around the world with Alan Whicker.</p> <p>But in between those luxurious documentaries, he was starting to ferret out the distinctive - and very Yorkshire - combination of grit, graft and natural beauty, which reached its apogee when he lighted on Birk Hatt Farm in Baldersdale. His connection with Hannah Hauxwell over two decades brought out the best in both; even when translated to Paris and New York, in what seemed a gimmicky bit of ratings-based exploitation, Hannah remained resolutely her excellent self, and Barry's filming stayed in keeping. Meanwhile, there were many other, less famous \"Hannahs\", from North Sea fishing crews to Cornish farmers, whose lives were celebrated in more than 100 networked YTV documentaries.</p> <p>Cockroft was a personable man, which not only endeared him to Hannah Hauxwell, but to colleagues in a competitive trade. He almost invariably worked with the same crew, from Mustafa Hammuri as cameraman to Julie O'Hare taking charge of research. In keeping with his \"Dino\" nickname, there were many others involved; a Cockroft descent on a lonely dale deliberately brought something of the glamour and buzz of bigtime film-making. Cockroft moved to Cornwall after the death of his first wife, but never really retired in spite of suffering from motor neurone disease in his last year. He was working on another Hauxwell book at the time of his death, and enthusiastically helping a young people's theatre in St Ives, Kidz R Us, with publicity and TV work.

Most of them are forgotten British civil servants - E A Gait and W C Plowden, for example - whose ungarlanded endeavours helped to shape the contours of an empire.</p> <p>But Mr Banthia, India's census commissioner, has a bigger task ahead of him than they did. Over the next three weeks, he is the man responsible for carrying out what is destined to become the largest statistical exercise in human history - India's latest, epic census.</p> <p>\"We have been putting in hard work over the last four years to ensure that every geographical area is covered,\" Mr Banthia said yesterday. \"You can't afford to miss a single village - even it if it is in deep forest, in the Himalayas, in the desert, or surrounded by river.\"</p> <p>India has held a census every decade since 1872, a series unbroken by war and civil strife. But this latest census differs from the 14 previous ones in the breadth of its ambition. Some 2m enumerators, most of them local teachers, set off yesterday to visit households in 650,000 villages and 5,500 Indian cities. They are expected to cover the subcontinent, for \u00a325 each, by camel, moped, canoe and on foot.</p> <p>\"They are very sincere. They are local people with familiar faces who are respected,\" the commissioner said.

Most of them are forgotten British civil servants - E A Gait and W C Plowden, for example - whose ungarlanded endeavours helped to shape the contours of an empire. But Mr Banthia, India's census commissioner, has a bigger task ahead of him than they did. Over the next three weeks, he is the man responsible for carrying out what is destined to become the largest statistical exercise in human history - India's latest, epic census. \"We have been putting in hard work over the last four years to ensure that every geographical area is covered,\" Mr Banthia said yesterday. \"You can't afford to miss a single village - even it if it is in deep forest, in the Himalayas, in the desert, or surrounded by river.\" India has held a census every decade since 1872, a series unbroken by war and civil strife. But this latest census differs from the 14 previous ones in the breadth of its ambition. Some 2m enumerators, most of them local teachers, set off yesterday to visit households in 650,000 villages and 5,500 Indian cities. They are expected to cover the subcontinent, for \u00a325 each, by camel, moped, canoe and on foot. \"They are very sincere. They are local people with familiar faces who are respected,\" the commissioner said. Their immediate aim between now and February 28 is to confirm what most demographers already agree on: that India is now home to more than a billion people, one sixth of the planet's population.

Children's height had remained unchanged. Peter Bundred, reader in primary care at Liverpool University, who led the study, said: \"We know that teenagers have become fatter, but for the first time we are seeing rapid increases in weight throughout the childhood years \u0085 \"The problem with toddlers is that we now have a situation where many mothers work, come home and need to do the housework, so sit their children in front of a television or video. People are also eating a lot more ready meals, which have a higher fat content.\"",

      "body": "<p>Britain's second largest drugs company, AstraZeneca, faced some hostility in the City yesterday after delivering a stark warning that sector analysts had over-hyped its new ulcer drug, Nexium. </p> <p>Chief executive Tom McKillop said the company's earnings in 2001 would be \"in the lower half\" of forecasts, with profits growth in its biggest therapeutic area, digestive medicines, likely to slow to zero. He said: \"I've constantly said that it would be a complex situation with a series of conflicting events affecting the outcome.\" </p> <p>Mr McKillop was speaking as AstraZeneca announced a 16% increase in annual profits to $4.11bn (\u00a32.8bn). The shares slumped 118p at one point, before recovering to close down 41p at \u00a329.63. </p> <p>A third of AstraZeneca's revenue is from ulcer treatment Losec, which is due to lose its US patent in October. Industry experts are divided on whether AstraZeneca's follow-up drug, Nexium, will be similarly successful. </p> <p>Nexium is scheduled to be launched in the US imminently, but the company is still waiting for clearance from the US food and drug administration. Mr McKillop said: \"We are still expecting to launch Nexium in the first quarter. Yes, it has taken a little longer than anticipated but we are now moving towards closure.\" </p> <p>AstraZeneca is thought to be concerned about the recent launch of rival ulcer drugs, which have pushed down the price of medicines in the US.

      "bodyText": "Britain's second largest drugs company, AstraZeneca, faced some hostility in the City yesterday after delivering a stark warning that sector analysts had over-hyped its new ulcer drug, Nexium. Chief executive Tom McKillop said the company's earnings in 2001 would be \"in the lower half\" of forecasts, with profits growth in its biggest therapeutic area, digestive medicines, likely to slow to zero. He said: \"I've constantly said that it would be a complex situation with a series of conflicting events affecting the outcome.\" Mr McKillop was speaking as AstraZeneca announced a 16% increase in annual profits to $4.11bn (\u00a32.8bn). The shares slumped 118p at one point, before recovering to close down 41p at \u00a329.63. A third of AstraZeneca's revenue is from ulcer treatment Losec, which is due to lose its US patent in October. Industry experts are divided on whether AstraZeneca's follow-up drug, Nexium, will be similarly successful. Nexium is scheduled to be launched in the US imminently, but the company is still waiting for clearance from the US food and drug administration. Mr McKillop said: \"We are still expecting to launch Nexium in the first quarter. Yes, it has taken a little longer than anticipated but we are now moving towards closure.\" AstraZeneca is thought to be concerned about the recent launch of rival ulcer drugs, which have pushed down the price of medicines in the US. The firm is still fighting 70 legal battles which will affect its ability to protect Losec from generic competition until October, when its patent expires. One analyst said: \"This is the second bad quarter they've had in a row, and there have been lots of missed promises.

      "bodyText": "Peter Mandelson risked reopening schisms within the Labour hierarchy last night as newspaper stories about him took the gloss off Tony Blair's agenda-setting speech. The former cabinet minister is understood to have defied No 10 in a high-stakes drive to salvage his reputation in a series of briefings, although in none of the papers is Mr Mandelson directly quoted. Mr Mandelson reportedly said he was seeking a public acknowledgment from Mr Blair that the home secretary, Jack Straw, was wrong to accuse him of being \"untruthful\" over his role in the Hinduja passport affair. He also made clear he wants to be appointed Britain's European commissioner. Details of his demands were published today after he visited the Tory-supporting Daily Mail and Daily Telegraph yesterday just hours before Mr Blair delivered his keynote speech. The timing of the intervention will inevitably strain Mr Mandelson's relationship with former allies in No 10 and at party headquarters in Millbank, and raise fresh questions about his judgment in the wake of the passport affair. The former Northern Ireland secretary's decision to speak to the two newspapers, insisting the conversations were off the record, will also anger Sir Anthony Hammond, who had asked all sides not to comment while his inquiry into the Hindujas' passport applications was in progress. As speculation swept Westminster that Mr Mandelson was poised to quit his Hartlepool seat, a source close to Downing Street said: \"A period of silence would be much advised from Mr Mandelson. I think everyone would find it in the party's best interest if he were to step down.\" The source added: \"He has to lay off. You can give someone so much rope. He's starting to pull. We're not going to have it.\" One of those present at yesterday's meetings said Mr Mandelson believed Mr Blair's press secretary, Alastair Campbell, had been at fault. The former minister also said he was \"completely gobsmacked\" when the premier said he had to resign. Mr Mandelson was confident he would be cleared of any wrongdoing and even cast doubt on whether he actually made a disputed phone call to the immigration minister, Mike O'Brien, about SP Hinduja's passport application in 1998. Making clear he would relish a post in Brussels where Neil Kinnock and Chris Patten are Britain's commissioners is unlikely to endear him to No 10 when he has yet to be cleared by the Hammond inquiry. The Times today carries a story inspired by Mr Mandelson's comments, while the FT yesterday ran a full page chronology of the events that led to his resignation, including the most favourable interpretation of events for the former minister. The FT story under the headline \"Was Blair right to sack his trusted ally?\" seemed to pin some of the blame on Mr Campbell, who was said to have \"incorrectly\" represented the position and \"may have misconstrued\" a crucial conversation with Mr Mandelson. But the private media offensive by Mr Mandelson, Labour's former director of communications, appears to fly in the face of public assurances he gave at the weekend. On returning from a week-long break in the US, during which he also spoke off the record to a number of journalists, Mr Mandelson said he would \"do nothing to harm\" the party of his political friends. \"My party's interests mean everything to me, and they always have done,\" he said. \u0095 Labour could be vulnerable at the next election to William Hague, who could emulate the victory achieved by President George Bush, according to an adviser to the defeated Democrat, Al Gore. Steve Morgan, a member of Mr Gore's inner circle who formerly worked at Labour's Millbank headquarters, has said in a memorandum to Mr Blair and the chancellor, Gordon Brown, that Mr Hague's populist approach could undermine their stewardship of a healthy economy and cost them the election, the New Statesman reports today.",

      "body": "<p>The US is fighting behind the scenes in New York to water down UN proposals aimed at overhauling sanctions policy.</p> <p>The UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, set up a special committee last April to examine sanctions policy after a string of failures over the past decade, especially over Iraq. He was particularly concerned about the humanitarian impact of sanctions on civilian populations.</p> <p>The committee, which is due to report next week, is to recommend a shift towards so-called \"smart sanctions\" that are more clearly defined and better targeted.</p> <p>But the US, which is intent on maintaining tough sanctions against Iraq with the backing of Britain, will almost certainly succeed in cutting out two key recommendations: one setting a time limit on sanctions and the other introducing majority voting on sanctions committees. Critics of sanctions claim they usually fail to undermine the targeted regimes, and that the criteria for imposition and the lifting of sanctions are too vague. The UN committee, which is chaired by Bangladesh's representative at the UN, Anwarul Chowdhury, tries to address these concerns.</p> <p>In a draft copy of its report the committee says: \"Sanctions regimes, in particular the security council resolutions that enact them, must be carefully designed, clearly establishing their goals, identifying the targets, tailoring the type of sanctions imposed so that they are adequate to the situation, specifying clear criteria that need to be satisfied in order for the sanctions to be suspended or lifted.\"</p> <p>Other recommendations include: targeting the finances of leaders rather than the general population; greater punishment for countries found to be breaking sanctions; and a carrot-and-stick approach which would see a gradual lifting of sanctions in response to partial compliance with UN resolutions.</p> <p>Echoing Mr Annan's concern about the impact on civilian populations, the committee recommends: \"Sanctions regimes should be, therefore, designed to minimise the potential for adverse humanitarian impacts and to maximise the ability for humanitarian goods and services to reach civilian populations.\"</p> <p>The committee also recommends that \"food, medicine and medical supplies be excluded from sanctions regimes\".</p> <p>The US secretary of state, Colin Powell, signalled on taking office that while he agreed there were too many sanctions in place, he wanted tighter restrictions in the case of Iraq. The US, while agreeing to most of the committee's report, wants to cut out a proposal that \"sanctions be imposed for limited periods of time, taking all factors into account\".</p> <p>Iraq is demanding a timetable for the lifting of sanctions in return for agreeing to allowing UN weapons inspectors into the country. The US is also opposed to a proposal that the UN sanctions committees, which oversee the embargoes, should \"consider majority voting for reaching decisions either of a procedural nature or related to humanitarian exemptions\".</p> <p>Decisions at present are by consensus: if the reform went ahead, Britain and the US would face the prospect of defeat on the Iraqi sanctions committee.

      "bodyText": "The US is fighting behind the scenes in New York to water down UN proposals aimed at overhauling sanctions policy. The UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, set up a special committee last April to examine sanctions policy after a string of failures over the past decade, especially over Iraq. He was particularly concerned about the humanitarian impact of sanctions on civilian populations. The committee, which is due to report next week, is to recommend a shift towards so-called \"smart sanctions\" that are more clearly defined and better targeted. But the US, which is intent on maintaining tough sanctions against Iraq with the backing of Britain, will almost certainly succeed in cutting out two key recommendations: one setting a time limit on sanctions and the other introducing majority voting on sanctions committees. Critics of sanctions claim they usually fail to undermine the targeted regimes, and that the criteria for imposition and the lifting of sanctions are too vague. The UN committee, which is chaired by Bangladesh's representative at the UN, Anwarul Chowdhury, tries to address these concerns. In a draft copy of its report the committee says: \"Sanctions regimes, in particular the security council resolutions that enact them, must be carefully designed, clearly establishing their goals, identifying the targets, tailoring the type of sanctions imposed so that they are adequate to the situation, specifying clear criteria that need to be satisfied in order for the sanctions to be suspended or lifted.\" Other recommendations include: targeting the finances of leaders rather than the general population; greater punishment for countries found to be breaking sanctions; and a carrot-and-stick approach which would see a gradual lifting of sanctions in response to partial compliance with UN resolutions. Echoing Mr Annan's concern about the impact on civilian populations, the committee recommends: \"Sanctions regimes should be, therefore, designed to minimise the potential for adverse humanitarian impacts and to maximise the ability for humanitarian goods and services to reach civilian populations.\" The committee also recommends that \"food, medicine and medical supplies be excluded from sanctions regimes\". The US secretary of state, Colin Powell, signalled on taking office that while he agreed there were too many sanctions in place, he wanted tighter restrictions in the case of Iraq. The US, while agreeing to most of the committee's report, wants to cut out a proposal that \"sanctions be imposed for limited periods of time, taking all factors into account\". Iraq is demanding a timetable for the lifting of sanctions in return for agreeing to allowing UN weapons inspectors into the country. The US is also opposed to a proposal that the UN sanctions committees, which oversee the embargoes, should \"consider majority voting for reaching decisions either of a procedural nature or related to humanitarian exemptions\". Decisions at present are by consensus: if the reform went ahead, Britain and the US would face the prospect of defeat on the Iraqi sanctions committee. Meanwhile, the US has ended its long-running dispute with the UN over funding. The Senate voted unanimously on Wednesday to release $582m (\u00a3400m) that the US owes in back dues. The US withheld the money until other countries agreed to take a bigger share of the finance. Before Christmas, Richard Holbrooke, who served as the Clinton administration's UN representative, brokered a deal to reduce US dues for the first time in more than 28 years.",

The judges ruled on Tuesday that his appeal \"must succeed\" on the basis of the unreliability of key prosecution witness Barry Thompson, who claimed during the trial at Maidstone crown court in 1998 that Stone had confessed to the killings while on remand. The crown admitted at the last minute that Thompson could not be relied upon as a \"witness of truth\" after he admitted he told the jury \"a pack of lies\". The judges then adjourned proceedings to consider the question of whether or not Stone - who remained in custody pending the decision - should face a new trial.</p> <p>Yesterday, Stone's counsel, William Clegg QC, argued that he could not have a fair trial because of the huge amount of prejudicial publicity surrounding the case. \"No jury could try his case fairly and any conviction resulting would inevitably be unsafe,\" he said.

Stone, wearing a white sports top, showed no emotion as the judges ordered the retrial, nor as Mr Clegg indicated that he would not be applying for bail on his client's behalf. A new trial is not likely to take place until the autumn and will probably be held away from Kent, where the crimes took place.</p> <p>His sister, Barbara, 38, said: \"We are thrilled to bits that the convictions have been quashed. At last he's got a chance to prove his innocence. Michael is happy that his conviction has been quashed too.\" Stone was given three life sentences for the murders of Lin Russell and Megan, six, and the attempted murder of Josie, then nine, near their home at Chillenden, Kent, in 1996. They were tied up and beaten with a hammer in a 15-minute attack.</p> <p>The bodies of Lin and Megan were found lying close to each other, covered in blood. Megan's swimming costume was found a few feet away. The family dog, Lucy, was also lying in the copse.</p> <p>Lin Russell's husband, Shaun, was told of the court ruling by a family liaison officer from Kent police. A spokesperson for the force said: \"We are happy with the decision and it would be inappropriate to make any further comment since our aim is to ensure that Michael Stone has a fair retrial.\" Lord Justice Kennedy, Mr Justice Maurice Kay and Mrs Justice Hallett are to give their reasons for the court's decision next week.

A longer internment would have seen more of the place trashed by the confined pair. The species which gave us the happiest nesting experience last year was the wren. Mother wren chose the inside apex of a stone archway for a secure nesting site. She judged the day of fledging perfectly, but the seven nestlings could only flutter straight down to the cobbles 10 feet below. We were watching - four baby wrens landed on me and clung briefly, and three on my wife. All rapidly followed their mother up the garden.

Fortunately, we were going in on a daily cat-feed rota and, finding the soot and mess made by the birds, and the panic-stricken exit of the feline, my wife was able to open a window and get the birds out. A longer internment would have seen more of the place trashed by the confined pair. The species which gave us the happiest nesting experience last year was the wren. Mother wren chose the inside apex of a stone archway for a secure nesting site. She judged the day of fledging perfectly, but the seven nestlings could only flutter straight down to the cobbles 10 feet below. We were watching - four baby wrens landed on me and clung briefly, and three on my wife. All rapidly followed their mother up the garden. She will be welcome again this year, though we cannot promise to be in the cushioning position. Harbingers of spring appeared on Stinchcombe Hill today. Morning mist cleared to winter sunshine and blue sky. Two larks were singing loudly, high against the sky, clearly proclaiming territorial rights, and a buzzard was circling in languid flight over woodland in a style reminiscent of warmer conditions.",

However, an error by Patrick Wintour in his description of one of these allegations (Media hounding Vaz says Cook, February 5) needs to be corrected. It is not true that Mr Sarosh Zaiwalla has ever claimed that he at any time made any payment in cash to Mr Vaz. This error has led to the claim by David Hencke (February 7) that Mr Zaiwalla has \"backed down\" over this allegation in giving oral evidence to the select committee on February 6. In fairness to Mr Zaiwalla, it should be made clear that he has been consistent throughout the inquiry in stating that he has never made any cash payment to Mr Vaz or any other payment to him personally or for his personal benefit. Mr Vaz, of course, has confirmed that he has never received any such payment. Geoffrey Bindman Bindman &amp; Partners Solicitors, London",

Personally I just like it with a touch of garlic because I like the taste of the dough. You can appreciate the great flavour if you don't drown it with cheese. The difference between making pizza properly and mass producing it is the difference between chargrilling a piece of meat or boiling it.

It was perhaps merciful that the tomato puree had no discernible flavour at all. Do people really want to eat such stuff? Well, clearly they do, and it isn't hard to see why. Pizza Express is familiar. It represents safe eating, the Angus Steak House of our vegetarian days. Naturally, it has followed the inevitable law of chain restaurants: the more money spent on kitting out the restaurants, the worse the food becomes. Design is the distraction. You get an eating experience instead of food. In a soulless kind of way, it's not a bad place to eat. It fits nicely into that space before or after a film or the theatre.</p> <p>And it is so cheap as to absent itself from criticism. Or is it? I paid \u00a311.60 for some tonno e fagioli, pizza and a glass of water.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>For some in the City, the Bank of England's decision to cut interest rates yesterday was a high risk, even a reckless, move. </p> <p>The economy looks pretty strong, the housing market is robust, pay settlements are nudging upwards, so cheaper money will simply lead to excess demand and higher inflation. Britain, quite simply, is not the United States. </p> <p>But think back to the autumn of 1999. At that point, inflation in the UK was below the government's 2.5% target yet the Bank's monetary policy committee did not hang about. It believed that the strength of the economy would eventually lead to upward pressure on prices so it took pre-emptive action, not once but four times. </p> <p>As a result, those who were quick to praise the Bank for being forward looking then should apply the same logic to yesterday's quarter-point reduction in rates. With the US economy looking weaker by the day, all the risks for the UK are on the downside. </p> <p>Underlying inflation stands at 2% and is heading towards 1.5% over the next few months, so the Bank need have no fear that its easing of monetary policy puts the government's 2.5% inflation target in jeopardy.</p> <p>Indeed, the real threat to the global economy is deflation not inflation, as Japan knows only too well. Since it was given operational control over interest rates in May 1997, the Bank has tended not to indulge in one-off moves. There was a progressive tightening of policy in 1997 and early 1998 followed by a steady easing in the aftermath of the Russian debt crisis in the summer of 1998. </p> <p>Yesterday's decision may buck the trend, being merely an insurance policy against a US-induced recession. But the chances are that rates will be closer to 5% than 6% by the end of the year. And rightly so. </p> <p><strong>Gloves are off </strong></p> <p>The surgical gloves have come off at Toft Hall, the quaintly named head office of SSL International. The condoms-to-catheters health care business is based in the nouveau riche enclave of Knutsford, Cheshire, which is somehow appropriate for a company which is new to the billion-pound league. </p> <p>It seems that directors want someone to take the blame for November's profits warning. Chief executive Iain Cater and chairman Stuart Wallis are the leading contenders, both commanding loyalty and dislike in equal measure. </p> <p>Critics of Cater maintain that he pushed through two mergers too quickly - first, linking Seton to Scholl and then adding Durex condoms maker London International. Having grown the company from \u00a330m to \u00a31.7bn, he was unable to keep a grip on its distant subsidiaries. </p> <p>His sympathisers point out that this is his first slip-up in 10 years, and that he had the right to expect advice and support from his more experienced non-executive colleagues. Wallis had previously run the health care business Fisons, and if anyone knows about stocking issues - the cause of SSL's difficulties - it is him. He contributed to the damage caused in November by dashing out of an analysts' meeting to catch a plane, and by giving the general impression that he was only peripherally involved. </p> <p>Boardroom tensions have been simmering at SSL for two months, which cannot be healthy for a business going through a critical recovery period. It is time for shareholders to decide whether they want to ditch a young management team for its first serious slip-up, or throw out the one experienced City name on the board. </p> <p><strong> Shell suits </strong></p> <p>Everything has always been done with due decorum at Shell Tower, so yesterday no one was trying to steal the limelight from Sir Mark Moody-Stuart, now in his twilight months as chairman of the Anglo-Dutch oil firm. But there was a noticeable trial run for Phil Watts, his successor, who takes the reins in June. </p> <p>Mr Watts fielded many of the questions and was ready to take more once Sir Mark had retired at the end of a results presentation to mark the group's $13.1bn (\u00a39bn) record annual profits, up 85% on last time. </p> <p>Preliminary results stories do not come much punchier than this, so Mr Watts was probably right to revel in the good times while they are here. However, even in a downturn he looks unlikely to wilt. </p> <p>The chairman-designate is a blunt no-nonsense Midlander in contrast with the urbane and cultured Sir Mark. Mr Watts has been with Shell since the 1960s and has put much of the fire into the company's highly successful restructuring. </p> <p>Asked whether we could expect to see any change of direction in the company under his chairmanship, he replied \"no\". Boring!, cried the audience. If being successful is boring then \"I like boring things,\" came the reply. So be it.</p>",

      "bodyText": "For some in the City, the Bank of England's decision to cut interest rates yesterday was a high risk, even a reckless, move. The economy looks pretty strong, the housing market is robust, pay settlements are nudging upwards, so cheaper money will simply lead to excess demand and higher inflation. Britain, quite simply, is not the United States. But think back to the autumn of 1999. At that point, inflation in the UK was below the government's 2.5% target yet the Bank's monetary policy committee did not hang about. It believed that the strength of the economy would eventually lead to upward pressure on prices so it took pre-emptive action, not once but four times. As a result, those who were quick to praise the Bank for being forward looking then should apply the same logic to yesterday's quarter-point reduction in rates. With the US economy looking weaker by the day, all the risks for the UK are on the downside. Underlying inflation stands at 2% and is heading towards 1.5% over the next few months, so the Bank need have no fear that its easing of monetary policy puts the government's 2.5% inflation target in jeopardy. Indeed, the real threat to the global economy is deflation not inflation, as Japan knows only too well. Since it was given operational control over interest rates in May 1997, the Bank has tended not to indulge in one-off moves. There was a progressive tightening of policy in 1997 and early 1998 followed by a steady easing in the aftermath of the Russian debt crisis in the summer of 1998. Yesterday's decision may buck the trend, being merely an insurance policy against a US-induced recession. But the chances are that rates will be closer to 5% than 6% by the end of the year. And rightly so. Gloves are off The surgical gloves have come off at Toft Hall, the quaintly named head office of SSL International. The condoms-to-catheters health care business is based in the nouveau riche enclave of Knutsford, Cheshire, which is somehow appropriate for a company which is new to the billion-pound league. It seems that directors want someone to take the blame for November's profits warning. Chief executive Iain Cater and chairman Stuart Wallis are the leading contenders, both commanding loyalty and dislike in equal measure. Critics of Cater maintain that he pushed through two mergers too quickly - first, linking Seton to Scholl and then adding Durex condoms maker London International. Having grown the company from \u00a330m to \u00a31.7bn, he was unable to keep a grip on its distant subsidiaries. His sympathisers point out that this is his first slip-up in 10 years, and that he had the right to expect advice and support from his more experienced non-executive colleagues. Wallis had previously run the health care business Fisons, and if anyone knows about stocking issues - the cause of SSL's difficulties - it is him. He contributed to the damage caused in November by dashing out of an analysts' meeting to catch a plane, and by giving the general impression that he was only peripherally involved. Boardroom tensions have been simmering at SSL for two months, which cannot be healthy for a business going through a critical recovery period. It is time for shareholders to decide whether they want to ditch a young management team for its first serious slip-up, or throw out the one experienced City name on the board. Shell suits Everything has always been done with due decorum at Shell Tower, so yesterday no one was trying to steal the limelight from Sir Mark Moody-Stuart, now in his twilight months as chairman of the Anglo-Dutch oil firm. But there was a noticeable trial run for Phil Watts, his successor, who takes the reins in June. Mr Watts fielded many of the questions and was ready to take more once Sir Mark had retired at the end of a results presentation to mark the group's $13.1bn (\u00a39bn) record annual profits, up 85% on last time. Preliminary results stories do not come much punchier than this, so Mr Watts was probably right to revel in the good times while they are here. However, even in a downturn he looks unlikely to wilt. The chairman-designate is a blunt no-nonsense Midlander in contrast with the urbane and cultured Sir Mark. Mr Watts has been with Shell since the 1960s and has put much of the fire into the company's highly successful restructuring. Asked whether we could expect to see any change of direction in the company under his chairmanship, he replied \"no\". Boring!, cried the audience. If being successful is boring then \"I like boring things,\" came the reply. So be it.",

      "body": "<p>Governments and their leaders can no longer hide from global justice, we have been repeatedly assured. They cannot shelter behind national jurisdictions and state sovereignty. Those responsible for human rights abuses, ethnic cleansing, atrocities and, most of all, war crimes, must and will be pursued regardless of national boundaries in an inter-dependent world.</p> <p>That was the theme of Nato's \"humanitarian war\" against Yugoslavia - enthusiastically championed by Tony Blair - and of the hunting down of Serbian and Croatian warlords, the plans for an international war crimes court and the millions of dollars handed out by the US congress for the prosecution of Iraqi leaders and their families.</p> <p>It was also the message of the citizen-led attempt to prosecute the Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet and the rupture of political relations between Austria and the rest of the European Union in response to the rise to power of J\u00f6rg Haider's far right Freedom party in Austria. But the partisans of this brave new \"doctrine of international community\" have been strangely subdued since the election of the extreme rightwing general Ariel Sharon as Israel's prime minister. It has, it transpires, been business as usual with the man held personally responsible for the largest massacre of civilians in the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict.</p> <p>The British prime minister had a reportedly cordial chat with Sharon on Wednesday, while Robin Cook looked forward to \"building on common ground\" and \"moving the peace process forward\" with a politician whose swaggering provocation in Jerusalem last year triggered the current Palestinian uprising and whose suggestion for dealing with demonstrators was to \"cut off their testicles\". President Bush meanwhile promised Sharon that US support for Israel was \"rock solid\".</p> <p>Of course, governments deal with all sorts of leaders with ugly records. But Sharon is more than that. By any reasonable reckoning, he is a war criminal. This is a man of blood, whose history of terror and violation of the rules of war stretches back to the early 50s, when his unit slaughtered Palestinian villagers, through his brutal onslaught on the refugees of Gaza in the 70s, to his central role in Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon in which up to 20,000 people died.</p> <p>Around 2,000 of them were butchered in 36 hours in the Palestinian refugee camps of Sabra and Shatila by Lebanese Phalangists effectively under Sharon's control. Sharon had repeatedly insisted that the camps were full of terrorists. In reality, the victims were overwhelmingly unarmed civilians, the PLO's fighters having been evacuated with an American-brokered promise of protection for their families.</p> <p>Israel's own Kahan commission found Sharon \"personally\" but \"indirectly\" responsible for the massacre, though whether an independent court would be so generous is open to question.</p> <p>Now Sharon's return to power will put the good faith of supporters of an international justice system to the test. Their critics maintain that the new supranational doctrine of intervention and extra-territorial legality is a fraud, designed to give a spurious human rights legitimacy to big power bullying of weaker states that threaten their authority or interests. War crimes or human rights violations committed by the major powers, or by western allies in particular, they argue, will always be treated according to different standards and go unpunished.</p> <p>The prospects are certainly not encouraging in the case of Israel, which has long been allowed by its western sponsors to violate a string of UN security council resolutions, while other states in the region are subjected to lethal regimes of sanctions and bombing attacks for their transgressions.</p> <p>Sharon's most horrific crimes are more recent than Pinochet's and his responsibility for the Sabra and Shatila killings is better documented than, say, that of the indicted former Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic for the comparable Srebrenica massacre. It will be objected that Sharon has been chosen in a democratic election and that pursuing him for 18-year-old crimes will do nothing to advance the chances of a peace settlement.</p> <p>Such a settlement will become more likely once the majority of Israelis realise that Sharon's hardline policies of repression will not deliver the security they crave, while sanctions seem more suitable for a state whose citizens have a say in policy, rather than for dictatorships where they have none.</p> <p>Of course, no western government is likely to lift a finger against Sharon, though human rights and pro-Palestinian groups are already gearing up to attempt a Pinochet-style legal action if he ventures abroad.

      "bodyText": "Governments and their leaders can no longer hide from global justice, we have been repeatedly assured. They cannot shelter behind national jurisdictions and state sovereignty. Those responsible for human rights abuses, ethnic cleansing, atrocities and, most of all, war crimes, must and will be pursued regardless of national boundaries in an inter-dependent world. That was the theme of Nato's \"humanitarian war\" against Yugoslavia - enthusiastically championed by Tony Blair - and of the hunting down of Serbian and Croatian warlords, the plans for an international war crimes court and the millions of dollars handed out by the US congress for the prosecution of Iraqi leaders and their families. It was also the message of the citizen-led attempt to prosecute the Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet and the rupture of political relations between Austria and the rest of the European Union in response to the rise to power of J\u00f6rg Haider's far right Freedom party in Austria. But the partisans of this brave new \"doctrine of international community\" have been strangely subdued since the election of the extreme rightwing general Ariel Sharon as Israel's prime minister. It has, it transpires, been business as usual with the man held personally responsible for the largest massacre of civilians in the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict. The British prime minister had a reportedly cordial chat with Sharon on Wednesday, while Robin Cook looked forward to \"building on common ground\" and \"moving the peace process forward\" with a politician whose swaggering provocation in Jerusalem last year triggered the current Palestinian uprising and whose suggestion for dealing with demonstrators was to \"cut off their testicles\". President Bush meanwhile promised Sharon that US support for Israel was \"rock solid\". Of course, governments deal with all sorts of leaders with ugly records. But Sharon is more than that. By any reasonable reckoning, he is a war criminal. This is a man of blood, whose history of terror and violation of the rules of war stretches back to the early 50s, when his unit slaughtered Palestinian villagers, through his brutal onslaught on the refugees of Gaza in the 70s, to his central role in Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon in which up to 20,000 people died. Around 2,000 of them were butchered in 36 hours in the Palestinian refugee camps of Sabra and Shatila by Lebanese Phalangists effectively under Sharon's control. Sharon had repeatedly insisted that the camps were full of terrorists. In reality, the victims were overwhelmingly unarmed civilians, the PLO's fighters having been evacuated with an American-brokered promise of protection for their families. Israel's own Kahan commission found Sharon \"personally\" but \"indirectly\" responsible for the massacre, though whether an independent court would be so generous is open to question. Now Sharon's return to power will put the good faith of supporters of an international justice system to the test. Their critics maintain that the new supranational doctrine of intervention and extra-territorial legality is a fraud, designed to give a spurious human rights legitimacy to big power bullying of weaker states that threaten their authority or interests. War crimes or human rights violations committed by the major powers, or by western allies in particular, they argue, will always be treated according to different standards and go unpunished. The prospects are certainly not encouraging in the case of Israel, which has long been allowed by its western sponsors to violate a string of UN security council resolutions, while other states in the region are subjected to lethal regimes of sanctions and bombing attacks for their transgressions. Sharon's most horrific crimes are more recent than Pinochet's and his responsibility for the Sabra and Shatila killings is better documented than, say, that of the indicted former Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic for the comparable Srebrenica massacre. It will be objected that Sharon has been chosen in a democratic election and that pursuing him for 18-year-old crimes will do nothing to advance the chances of a peace settlement. Such a settlement will become more likely once the majority of Israelis realise that Sharon's hardline policies of repression will not deliver the security they crave, while sanctions seem more suitable for a state whose citizens have a say in policy, rather than for dictatorships where they have none. Of course, no western government is likely to lift a finger against Sharon, though human rights and pro-Palestinian groups are already gearing up to attempt a Pinochet-style legal action if he ventures abroad. There is little prospect even of some mark of disapproval, such as a Haider-style diplomatic protest or the suspension of arms sales called for by a group of Labour MPs on Wednesday. These might at least send Israeli voters the message that there are limits to external material support. During the Kosovo war, Tony Blair announced that his foreign intervention policy was based on a \"subtle blend\" of self-interest and moral purpose.

      "byline": "Peter Bradshaw",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Garlanded with Golden Globes, Bafta nominations and Oscar rumours, this is the most over-rated cinema event of the year: a bafflingly heavy-handed coming-of-age nostalgia-fest about the early 1970s rock scene, apparently based on director Cameron Crowe's own teenage adventures in rock journalism. It systematically pulls the teeth from rock music, detaching from it all sense of danger, excitement and hedonism, making it instead a soundtrack for Crowe's heart-warming, mind-numbing morality tale about family values. </p> <p>Patrick Fugit plays William, a cute 15-year-old who flukes his way into going on the road with an up-and-coming rock band called Stillwater, and writing about it for Rolling Stone. He's given big-brotherish support and advice from journalist Lester Bangs (Philip Seymour Hoffman) but his querulous, protective mom Frances McDormand is having kittens about the whole business. </p> <p>Spinal Tap set the bar very, very high for the level of humour and affectionate connoisseurship required for something like this and, in fact, Almost Famous often looks like Spinal Tap minus the gags and indeed the insight. (A scene in which the manager shows the band the new T-shirt design is practically a replica of Tap's notorious Smell the Glove album-cover argument.) </p> <p>When Patrick tries to blag his way backstage, earnestly announcing himself as a \"journalist\", he gets a homily from Stillwater's lead guitarist Russell, played by Billy Crudup in the hairy, sloppy early-1970s mode he deployed for playing runner Steve Prefontaine in Without Limits. \"We play for the fans, not the critics,\" he says. But Patrick shows Russell he knows all about the music, so they let him in. It is a basically a cumbersome, solemn version of Wayne and Garth throwing themselves at the feet of Alice Cooper and chanting: \"We are not worthy.\" And Wayne's World seems oddly more sincere, and more knowledgeable, than Cameron Crowe's world. Here, and throughout, the vital element of wit is missing. But lots of other things are missing too. </p> <p>Sex, for example. We all know about the crazed egotists of rock: the wildmen and Aleister Crowley enthusiasts with their retinues of jailbait groupies - the legions of wealthy men for whom feminism was still just a rumour. Almost Famous primly distinguishes between the exploited women and a higher class of girl called a \"band aid\" - more like a sweetly pretty and largely platonic muse on the tour bus - personified by the kooky yet gorgeous Penny Lane, played by the fantastically irritating Kate Hudson, who is perpetually laughing with transcendentally blonde flower-child wisdom. (Wouldn't Liv Tyler have been more piquant casting?) A group of older band-aids skittishly deflower innocent cherubic Patrick: a very cute reversal of the usual male- female roles in \"deflowering\" situations on the road. </p> <p>So, please, who on earth does Crowe think he's kidding? Maybe the coy \"band aid\" stuff was what some rock star or rock chick told him when he was a naive teenager; maybe they believed it and maybe he believed them - at the time. But now? </p> <p>Then there are drugs. There's no nasty jacking up - but Russell has an \"acid trip\": perhaps the safest, cleanest, most U-certificate Yellow Submarine acid trip in history. It causes him to be a bit feisty at a teenagers' party, jumping off the roof into a swimming pool, fully clothed. No Brian Jones-style d\u00e9nouement , and afterwards he's as right as rain. The only overdose situation comes deliberately, when poor vulnerable and unhappy Penny Lane gets into a near-thing - with quaaludes, famously the pharmaceutical of choice for the Carpenter siblings. </p> <p>Finally, of course, there's rock'n'roll itself, and Crowe's biggest crime is to make this sound so comfy and dull. The big problem is that we have to sit through a lot of Stillwater's imaginary numbers: and very vapid they are too. When a blast of real Jimi Hendrix comes on the soundtrack, it's like a slug of Jack Daniel's after drinking diluted Sunny Delight. </p> <p>Inevitably, Patrick finally has to go home to mom, and there's a soupy \"home's best\" moral implied.

      "bodyText": "Garlanded with Golden Globes, Bafta nominations and Oscar rumours, this is the most over-rated cinema event of the year: a bafflingly heavy-handed coming-of-age nostalgia-fest about the early 1970s rock scene, apparently based on director Cameron Crowe's own teenage adventures in rock journalism. It systematically pulls the teeth from rock music, detaching from it all sense of danger, excitement and hedonism, making it instead a soundtrack for Crowe's heart-warming, mind-numbing morality tale about family values. Patrick Fugit plays William, a cute 15-year-old who flukes his way into going on the road with an up-and-coming rock band called Stillwater, and writing about it for Rolling Stone. He's given big-brotherish support and advice from journalist Lester Bangs (Philip Seymour Hoffman) but his querulous, protective mom Frances McDormand is having kittens about the whole business. Spinal Tap set the bar very, very high for the level of humour and affectionate connoisseurship required for something like this and, in fact, Almost Famous often looks like Spinal Tap minus the gags and indeed the insight. (A scene in which the manager shows the band the new T-shirt design is practically a replica of Tap's notorious Smell the Glove album-cover argument.) When Patrick tries to blag his way backstage, earnestly announcing himself as a \"journalist\", he gets a homily from Stillwater's lead guitarist Russell, played by Billy Crudup in the hairy, sloppy early-1970s mode he deployed for playing runner Steve Prefontaine in Without Limits. \"We play for the fans, not the critics,\" he says. But Patrick shows Russell he knows all about the music, so they let him in. It is a basically a cumbersome, solemn version of Wayne and Garth throwing themselves at the feet of Alice Cooper and chanting: \"We are not worthy.\" And Wayne's World seems oddly more sincere, and more knowledgeable, than Cameron Crowe's world. Here, and throughout, the vital element of wit is missing. But lots of other things are missing too. Sex, for example. We all know about the crazed egotists of rock: the wildmen and Aleister Crowley enthusiasts with their retinues of jailbait groupies - the legions of wealthy men for whom feminism was still just a rumour. Almost Famous primly distinguishes between the exploited women and a higher class of girl called a \"band aid\" - more like a sweetly pretty and largely platonic muse on the tour bus - personified by the kooky yet gorgeous Penny Lane, played by the fantastically irritating Kate Hudson, who is perpetually laughing with transcendentally blonde flower-child wisdom. (Wouldn't Liv Tyler have been more piquant casting?) A group of older band-aids skittishly deflower innocent cherubic Patrick: a very cute reversal of the usual male- female roles in \"deflowering\" situations on the road. So, please, who on earth does Crowe think he's kidding? Maybe the coy \"band aid\" stuff was what some rock star or rock chick told him when he was a naive teenager; maybe they believed it and maybe he believed them - at the time. But now? Then there are drugs. There's no nasty jacking up - but Russell has an \"acid trip\": perhaps the safest, cleanest, most U-certificate Yellow Submarine acid trip in history. It causes him to be a bit feisty at a teenagers' party, jumping off the roof into a swimming pool, fully clothed. No Brian Jones-style d\u00e9nouement , and afterwards he's as right as rain. The only overdose situation comes deliberately, when poor vulnerable and unhappy Penny Lane gets into a near-thing - with quaaludes, famously the pharmaceutical of choice for the Carpenter siblings. Finally, of course, there's rock'n'roll itself, and Crowe's biggest crime is to make this sound so comfy and dull. The big problem is that we have to sit through a lot of Stillwater's imaginary numbers: and very vapid they are too. When a blast of real Jimi Hendrix comes on the soundtrack, it's like a slug of Jack Daniel's after drinking diluted Sunny Delight. Inevitably, Patrick finally has to go home to mom, and there's a soupy \"home's best\" moral implied. Well, it's supposed to be a love letter to the period, and Crowe has made no bones about using a rose-tinted lens. But did he have to be so wilfully naive? And what's the point of sentimentally excising the dark side of rock when it's precisely the filth and sleaze that many of his target audience will be perversely sentimental about? If this solemn and disconcertingly reactionary film gets Academy awards it will be very depressing, though perhaps a prize is due for Philip Seymour Hoffman: droll, raddled, winningly concerned for his young protege. He gets the film's one genuine laugh, dancing to Iggy Pop and doing a very wacky windmill movement with his arms.

What does this television phenomenon say about where women are at? And how did a show targeted at a niche audience become such a hit that even the defeated Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, could joke this week that he was planning to catch up on all the episodes of Sex and the City that he'd missed?</p> <p>The most important ingredient is loadsasex. This is the show which sent shockwaves through the prim US television world as the most sexually explicit programme ever. But don't be confused, the nudity is discreet, sex scenes rare and shots are coy (postcoital women always have sheets pulled over their breasts). The emphasis is not on the action, but on talking about it and here, it really does get radical. The four discuss every kind of sex - masturbation, dildos, telephone sex and blow jobs - comparing experiences, offering advice and encouragement. Nothing is out of bounds, sex is an adventure playground which doesn't necessarily have much to do with love.</p> <p>This kind of treatment probably has a lot to do with the gay scriptwriters playing on male fantasies of female availability and voracious appetite. But the sex stuff works because it turns on its head the age-old female sexual victimhood. The whole rationale of Sex and the City is that these women want pleasure, know how to get it and are determined to do so. And the kick is in the assumption that the women are always great in bed, the men more variable. Patriarchy's Great Stud Myth is toppled as these women analyse and judge men's performance; they spare no quarter, ruthlessly trampling over men's sexual insecurities by comparing and contrasting their lovers. It's brash bravura - and highly entertaining. </p> <p>The second ingredient is to wrap up the sex in an idealised world. This is pure escapism - the sort which has intelligent women glued to Hello and OK! magazines, a voyeuristic appetite to glimpse the perfect lives of other people. It's part of the way many women often measure up their lives: once, they would have twitched the net curtains, now they read about Tom and Nicole's marriage breakdown or follow the shenanigans of Carrie and Big.</p> <p>In this perfect world, there is little evidence of work, and even less of stress and exhaustion. The women invariably look stunning in a huge range of dressy clothes, have perfect figures and high-maintenance hair. Keeping up those kinds of appearances (all those saunas and exercise classes) should be a near full-time task. The large wardrobes are complemented by stylish apartments in stylish neighbourhoods and eating in stylish restaurants. There is a leisurely ease in their lives, and what's airbrushed out is that element of squalor, filth, and irritation (no cabs and traffic gridlock) which is an inescapable part of most city-living. New York is transformed from the city with more rats than human beings to a glamorous metropolis of beautiful people.</p> <p>In this perfect urban world, the women have a perfect female camaraderie. Their friendship has replaced families and men as the most durable, unconditional relationship: it's really a manifesto for lesbian separatism. What's omitted is the competitiveness and rivalry which, more or less submerged, runs through a lot of female friendship; for example, how come these sexually voracious women never go after each other's men? But there's enough truth in it to give a glimpse of the wonderfully refreshing intimacies of single, childless, female-only company - scurrilously scathing of male pretension and hysterically funny. </p> <p>What this all adds up to is feminism lite - which is about as much feminism as the mainstream wants right now. Carrie may use her oven as a storage cupboard and Miranda has no use for a rolling pin, but apart from shedding domestic chores, the lives of these women still revolve entirely around men. They end up reinforcing the double standards against which they rail so wittily. </p> <p>Barak will find it soothing escapism; men have nothing to fear because while they may find the sexual assertiveness a bit intimidating (as well as exciting) and the lack of cooking a disappointment, they can be reassured that they are still the sole object of any sensible woman's life. In the end, the only weapon these women have is their humour. Their lives are uncannily like those of another current TV drama, Nancy Mitford's characters in Love in a Cold Climate: full of dressing up and husband hunting. And this is after 60 years of feminism.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:\" madeleine.bunting@theguardian.com\">madeleine.bunting@theguardian.com</a></p>",

Patriarchy's Great Stud Myth is toppled as these women analyse and judge men's performance; they spare no quarter, ruthlessly trampling over men's sexual insecurities by comparing and contrasting their lovers. It's brash bravura - and highly entertaining. The second ingredient is to wrap up the sex in an idealised world. This is pure escapism - the sort which has intelligent women glued to Hello and OK! magazines, a voyeuristic appetite to glimpse the perfect lives of other people. It's part of the way many women often measure up their lives: once, they would have twitched the net curtains, now they read about Tom and Nicole's marriage breakdown or follow the shenanigans of Carrie and Big. In this perfect world, there is little evidence of work, and even less of stress and exhaustion. The women invariably look stunning in a huge range of dressy clothes, have perfect figures and high-maintenance hair. Keeping up those kinds of appearances (all those saunas and exercise classes) should be a near full-time task. The large wardrobes are complemented by stylish apartments in stylish neighbourhoods and eating in stylish restaurants. There is a leisurely ease in their lives, and what's airbrushed out is that element of squalor, filth, and irritation (no cabs and traffic gridlock) which is an inescapable part of most city-living. New York is transformed from the city with more rats than human beings to a glamorous metropolis of beautiful people. In this perfect urban world, the women have a perfect female camaraderie. Their friendship has replaced families and men as the most durable, unconditional relationship: it's really a manifesto for lesbian separatism. What's omitted is the competitiveness and rivalry which, more or less submerged, runs through a lot of female friendship; for example, how come these sexually voracious women never go after each other's men? But there's enough truth in it to give a glimpse of the wonderfully refreshing intimacies of single, childless, female-only company - scurrilously scathing of male pretension and hysterically funny. What this all adds up to is feminism lite - which is about as much feminism as the mainstream wants right now. Carrie may use her oven as a storage cupboard and Miranda has no use for a rolling pin, but apart from shedding domestic chores, the lives of these women still revolve entirely around men. They end up reinforcing the double standards against which they rail so wittily. Barak will find it soothing escapism; men have nothing to fear because while they may find the sexual assertiveness a bit intimidating (as well as exciting) and the lack of cooking a disappointment, they can be reassured that they are still the sole object of any sensible woman's life. In the end, the only weapon these women have is their humour. Their lives are uncannily like those of another current TV drama, Nancy Mitford's characters in Love in a Cold Climate: full of dressing up and husband hunting. And this is after 60 years of feminism. madeleine.bunting@theguardian.com",

In an astonishing diatribe Bates claimed in a letter to the Football Association chief executive Adam Crozier that he was resigning because he did not \"trust or respect\" a number of people working on the project. Bates, who was criticised for his handling of the Wembley project, described Sir David Hill-Wood, vice-chairman of Wembley National Stadium Limited, as \"my Brutus\".

Meanwhile, outside the venue, gay rights groups are up in arms about the singer's lyrical use of violent imagery and supposed homophobia. In front of police lines, people distribute leaflets claiming \"Eminem has gone too far\".</p> <p>Sympathies aside, casual bystanders could be forgiven for wondering why a pop star could provoke such fury. Over the next few weeks, Anthony Hopkins will stalk our screens as Hannibal the Cannibal. Nobody expects the actor to really eat human limbs for supper, but in pop there is an identification of the singer with the song. Eminem's music is filled with murderous, misogynous characters such as Slim Shady, but there is nothing to suggest this is any more real than Hammer Horror, or, Sir Cliff's satanic Devil Women. Eminem (real name Marshall Mathers) hails from a dysfunctional Detroit background and has a troubled personal life, but is primarily a fantasist. He is pop*s own Stephen King, producing art that's repellent but compelling. His use of words like \"bitch\" and \"faggot\" is unfortunate, but in US hip-hop these are put-downs, with less of the inflammatory ramifications they have here. </p> <p>Sixteen thousand fans gave the thumbs up to a show rooted in cinematic horror. Eminem - as Slim - recreates the Texas Chainsaw Massacre (in accordance with officialdom, the saw is not plugged in) and appears in an electric chair. Much of the rest is a very standard rap show. The contentious lyrics are often inaudible. On record Eminem comes across as a genuinely anti-social nihilist, but live is a good old-fashioned crowd pleaser. Of course, few escape his cartoon rage - from his mum to the thousands of \"bitches\" in the audience who cheer his homicidal threats. It certainly helps that the bad boy is very cute. At one point, he gets the entire audience to shout that they're \"drug addicts\". Really? Noticeably, he draws the line at racism. As a white rapper who has fought hard for the respect of the rap community, his instincts for self-preservation over-rides that for shock. </p> <p>And on record, Eminem is a master of complex psychological games. His detractors have not noticed that his glorious hit Stan explores unrequited male to male adoration, but here the song's eerie gravitas is undermined by raps of \"England\". Of the vaunted homophobia, one of Eminem's rappers wields a rubber phallus but it's more pantomime than sinister. A more dicey moment arrives when Eminem (\"against my attorney's advice\" - really?) mentions the weapons charges facing him in the US, but it becomes just a way of introducing his tune Criminal. Eminem is playing some dangerous games, but the bottom line is showbiz.</p> <p>\u0095 Eminem plays the Docklands Arena, London E14 (020-7538 1212), tonight and tomorrow.</p> <p><strong>Related articles</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4131548,00.html\">6.2.2001: Eminem is a poetic genius</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/netnotes/article/0,6729,380135,00.html\">NetNotes: Eminem</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,435692,00.html\">09.01.2001: Eminem evokes fear and loathing in the UK</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Eminem's reputation as world's number one bad boy rapper precedes him. Amid scenes reminiscent of the Sex Pistols, his records have been banned by student unions. Prior to this opening night of his much- publicised UK visit, Manchester council and police forces placed restrictions on the show. Meanwhile, outside the venue, gay rights groups are up in arms about the singer's lyrical use of violent imagery and supposed homophobia. In front of police lines, people distribute leaflets claiming \"Eminem has gone too far\". Sympathies aside, casual bystanders could be forgiven for wondering why a pop star could provoke such fury. Over the next few weeks, Anthony Hopkins will stalk our screens as Hannibal the Cannibal. Nobody expects the actor to really eat human limbs for supper, but in pop there is an identification of the singer with the song. Eminem's music is filled with murderous, misogynous characters such as Slim Shady, but there is nothing to suggest this is any more real than Hammer Horror, or, Sir Cliff's satanic Devil Women. Eminem (real name Marshall Mathers) hails from a dysfunctional Detroit background and has a troubled personal life, but is primarily a fantasist. He is pop*s own Stephen King, producing art that's repellent but compelling. His use of words like \"bitch\" and \"faggot\" is unfortunate, but in US hip-hop these are put-downs, with less of the inflammatory ramifications they have here. Sixteen thousand fans gave the thumbs up to a show rooted in cinematic horror. Eminem - as Slim - recreates the Texas Chainsaw Massacre (in accordance with officialdom, the saw is not plugged in) and appears in an electric chair. Much of the rest is a very standard rap show. The contentious lyrics are often inaudible. On record Eminem comes across as a genuinely anti-social nihilist, but live is a good old-fashioned crowd pleaser. Of course, few escape his cartoon rage - from his mum to the thousands of \"bitches\" in the audience who cheer his homicidal threats. It certainly helps that the bad boy is very cute. At one point, he gets the entire audience to shout that they're \"drug addicts\". Really? Noticeably, he draws the line at racism. As a white rapper who has fought hard for the respect of the rap community, his instincts for self-preservation over-rides that for shock. And on record, Eminem is a master of complex psychological games. His detractors have not noticed that his glorious hit Stan explores unrequited male to male adoration, but here the song's eerie gravitas is undermined by raps of \"England\". Of the vaunted homophobia, one of Eminem's rappers wields a rubber phallus but it's more pantomime than sinister. A more dicey moment arrives when Eminem (\"against my attorney's advice\" - really?) mentions the weapons charges facing him in the US, but it becomes just a way of introducing his tune Criminal. Eminem is playing some dangerous games, but the bottom line is showbiz. \u0095 Eminem plays the Docklands Arena, London E14 (020-7538 1212), tonight and tomorrow.
