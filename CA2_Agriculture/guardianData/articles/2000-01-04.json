But at the end of the 20th century, that culture collided with Welsh feminism and, in round one at least, Welsh feminism won through.</p> <p>The turning point came last January when Anita Gayle, a feisty 59-year-old who was then General Secretary of the Welsh Labour Party, turned up at Cynon Valley's selection meeting to enforce the controversial twinning process for selecting Assembly candidates which the local party was refusing to implement.

Months later, the public delivered their verdict and a new, more feminised Wales was born, with an Assembly whose 40% female membership put it way ahead of the national trend. The Labour group in the Welsh Assembly enters the new millennium boasting more women than men and a cabinet that is, excluding leader Alun Michael, entirely equal. Moreover, Edwina Hart's position as economic secretary signals women's entry into jobs traditionally perceived as men's.</p> <p>But it has not all been plain sailing. Many women who went for Assembly seats encountered hostility. Val Feld, former director of the Welsh EOC and now Assembly member for Swansea East, was one of a number of women who received poison pen letters during the selection process. Having spent her life defending other women against discrimination, she admits: 'I was shaken by the letters and by how undermined I felt.'</p> <p>Resistance to women's involvement in politics remains high in certain areas and the fear is that this resentment may be coming home to roost in the run-up to the parliamentary selections, set to begin in a few weeks' time. There are mutterings that decisions about vacant safe seats are being stitched up in the all-male bars and clubs that litter the Welsh valleys. As Huw Lewis, Assembly member for Merthyr Tydfil, puts it: 'There are a lot of bitter and bruised men out there. Many simply cannot accept that a woman beat them and they won't forget that in a hurry.'</p> <p>Backlash may be part of the story, but it is not the whole story. As Julie Morgan, MP for Cardiff North, puts it: 'Twinning changed the face of Welsh politics. The public have got used to seeing women in powerful positions and more and more women now realise that politics is for them.' Men, too, are part of this cultural revolution. Huw Lewis, Assistant General Secretary when the twinning campaign was launched, had reservations - until he saw ugly prejudices laid bare. 'It made me realise that without positive action, many of these women simply would not be where they are now.'</p> <p>Success in the Assembly is giving Welsh feminists the confidence to focus on Westminster. Here the record is appalling. Of 40 Welsh MPs, just four are women (all Labour). This is well below the national average of 18% and four times lower than in the Welsh Assembly. The forthcoming selections for safe Labour seats offer an opportunity to double women's representation in Wales. Six seats are available: select a woman, goes the logic, and you are almost certain to deliver another woman to Parliament. Welsh Labour women's bid to beat the old boys' network is spearheaded by Julie Morgan MP, in tandem with the Labour Women's Network. They have already held one training day in Cardiff and two more are planned. Local women are putting themselves forward, often for up to three seats, even if they do not believe they have a chance of winning. <br><br> Jessica Morden, 31 and new General Secretary for Wales, says more are standing than ever before and optimists speculate that traditional Labour strongholds like Caerphilly could surprise everyone, while Wrexham is hot favourite to select a woman.</p> <p>Nevertheless, it would be unwise to overstate the extent of the cultural shift. Rapid feminisation coexists with deep-seated traditional attitudes. 'It's an awful thing to admit,' Anita Gayle says, 'but party members will accept women only with a degree of compulsion.' As Val Feld points out: 'You don't change patterns of behaviour and values overnight. There are positive signals in Wales, but it is still early days.' She favours renewed commitment to positive action at national level, but while constituency parties still have an obligation to produce 50:50 shortlists, experience suggests equality of opportunity does not result in equality of outcome. Three of the four Welsh women MPs currently in Westminster were selected through all-women shortlists and they are in marginal seats. 'The current system is flawed,' Julie Morgan says. 'There is a danger we will not capitalise on the gains of the Welsh Assembly and could end up with fewer female politicians in Wales after the next general election.' <br><br> The selections come at an important moment in Welsh political history and Wrexham, which kicks off the process, will be an important test of the party's feminisation. 'If women don't score well there,' Morgan argues, 'we still have time to organise ourselves and to raise our profile.' This is not victim feminism and why should it be?<br><br> In spite of the trouble and strife, 1999 was a good year for Welsh feminism and democracy, and equality campaigners are determined to consolidate on their victory. At her retirement party last year, Anita Gayle was handed a T-shirt with 'I'm a feminist' on the front, 'And a trollop' on the back. The joke went down well, but then Gayle and many other Welsh women could afford to laugh. Last year, they won through in ways unprecedented in Britain. Whether they will still be smiling after the next parliamentary selections remains to be seen.</p>",

Many simply cannot accept that a woman beat them and they won't forget that in a hurry.' Backlash may be part of the story, but it is not the whole story. As Julie Morgan, MP for Cardiff North, puts it: 'Twinning changed the face of Welsh politics. The public have got used to seeing women in powerful positions and more and more women now realise that politics is for them.' Men, too, are part of this cultural revolution. Huw Lewis, Assistant General Secretary when the twinning campaign was launched, had reservations - until he saw ugly prejudices laid bare. 'It made me realise that without positive action, many of these women simply would not be where they are now.' Success in the Assembly is giving Welsh feminists the confidence to focus on Westminster. Here the record is appalling. Of 40 Welsh MPs, just four are women (all Labour). This is well below the national average of 18% and four times lower than in the Welsh Assembly. The forthcoming selections for safe Labour seats offer an opportunity to double women's representation in Wales. Six seats are available: select a woman, goes the logic, and you are almost certain to deliver another woman to Parliament. Welsh Labour women's bid to beat the old boys' network is spearheaded by Julie Morgan MP, in tandem with the Labour Women's Network. They have already held one training day in Cardiff and two more are planned. Local women are putting themselves forward, often for up to three seats, even if they do not believe they have a chance of winning. Jessica Morden, 31 and new General Secretary for Wales, says more are standing than ever before and optimists speculate that traditional Labour strongholds like Caerphilly could surprise everyone, while Wrexham is hot favourite to select a woman. Nevertheless, it would be unwise to overstate the extent of the cultural shift. Rapid feminisation coexists with deep-seated traditional attitudes. 'It's an awful thing to admit,' Anita Gayle says, 'but party members will accept women only with a degree of compulsion.' As Val Feld points out: 'You don't change patterns of behaviour and values overnight. There are positive signals in Wales, but it is still early days.' She favours renewed commitment to positive action at national level, but while constituency parties still have an obligation to produce 50:50 shortlists, experience suggests equality of opportunity does not result in equality of outcome. Three of the four Welsh women MPs currently in Westminster were selected through all-women shortlists and they are in marginal seats. 'The current system is flawed,' Julie Morgan says. 'There is a danger we will not capitalise on the gains of the Welsh Assembly and could end up with fewer female politicians in Wales after the next general election.' The selections come at an important moment in Welsh political history and Wrexham, which kicks off the process, will be an important test of the party's feminisation. 'If women don't score well there,' Morgan argues, 'we still have time to organise ourselves and to raise our profile.' This is not victim feminism and why should it be? In spite of the trouble and strife, 1999 was a good year for Welsh feminism and democracy, and equality campaigners are determined to consolidate on their victory. At her retirement party last year, Anita Gayle was handed a T-shirt with 'I'm a feminist' on the front, 'And a trollop' on the back. The joke went down well, but then Gayle and many other Welsh women could afford to laugh. Last year, they won through in ways unprecedented in Britain. Whether they will still be smiling after the next parliamentary selections remains to be seen.",

      "bodyText": "Among the report's 52 recommendations are: Abolish tuition fees for Scottish domiciled students - the Scottish Executive to pick up the estimated \u00a312m shortfall to the sector. Set up the Scottish Graduate Endowment - all Scottish domiciled and European Union students starting courses from October 2001 will sign a contract to pay \u00a33,075 to the fund once their graduate salary tops \u00a325,000. Ministers should consider early payment incentives. Ministers in England, Wales and Northern Ireland should waive fourth-year fees for Scottish universities as a matter of urgency. A new body, Student Finance Scotland, to collect and take over wide-ranging responsibilities for student support. A charitable trust, the Scottish Graduate Endowment Foundation, to provide additional support for higher and further education students, receiving donations from existing graduates, firms or members of the public. Students genuinely unable to find work during the summer vacation should have access to benefits. Support for students increased to \u00a34,100 (away from home), \u00a33,240 (living at home) and \u00a35,050 (in London). Review support for further education students. Students should be limited to maximum of 10 hours a week paid work in term time. Three years' bursary support in FE college/school for young people from low-income backgrounds, plus bursaries in higher education equal to half the total support available. Childcare allowance of \u00a31,500 for lone-parent students. Disabled student allowance to be open to all higher education students. Review means test - low- and middle-income parents to pay less and better off pay more. Wider Access and Mature Students' bursary schemes to target non-repayable support to particularly disadvantaged students - schemes administered by universities and colleges and would absorb current Access Funds. Better information for prospective students on the internet and in libraries. Tax breaks as incentives for people to contribute to Individual Learning Accounts. Review support for postgraduate students.",

      "bodyText": "Every developed country is struggling to keep pace with the intellectual arms race. They know that if they don't educate more of their citizens to a higher level, they'll fall behind but they also know there are limits to what taxpayers are willing to shell out for students. It's a perennial issue, which seemed to have quietened down again in Britain once David Blunkett settled on paid tuition fees in the year after Labour was elected. But now it's come charging back up the agenda, and in a way that will probably affect students throughout the United Kingdom. Shortly before Christmas, a report to the Scottish Parliament on student finance was produced in response to the furious political row north of the border over tuition fees and student loans. This week, a small group of Labour and Liberal Democrat politicians are trying to thrash out a deal based on the report, to save their ruling coalition in Edinburgh. They have not got much time - in two weeks it is the Scottish Nationalists' turn to choose the subject of debate in the Parliament, and the executive is under pressure to agree a policy by then. But that battle for short-term tactical advantage at Holyrood will have consequences that reverberate far beyond Edinburgh. For the committee chaired by Edinburgh lawyer Andrew Cubie has tried to find a Scottish answer for a global phenomenon - the continuing pressure on funding for higher education. \"Set against a widespread expansion of participation, the main policy issue facing student support for further and higher education is how to bring in private money to the sectors.\" Scotland has taken participation further than the rest of Britain: 47% of young people, and half of all young women, go on to higher education there. But the problem is especially acute for a small nation that is determined to hang on to its four-year degrees. New Labour's answer to the problem was announced in the heady weeks after the 1997 general election victory: means-tested annual tuition fees of \u00a31,000 (this year \u00a31,025) to be paid upfront while students can borrow from the Student Loans Company to cover fees and living costs up to a maximum of \u00a33,635 a year. Repayment starts when the graduate's income reaches \u00a310,000 a year. Crucially, Labour completed the phasing out of grants which the Conservatives began. Blunkett, as incoming education secretary, ignored the recommendations of the Dearing committee to keep some grants and levy contributions from graduates along the lines of the Australian Higher Education Contributions Scheme. Public meetings throughout Scotland and a mass of written evidence left Cubie and his committee in little doubt that fees were extremely unpopular in Scotland and the parental or student contribution ought to be abolished. His report makes uncomfortable reading for Blunkett. The system for funding students was \"ineffective, insufficient and indecipherable\" and many students were taking on high levels of additional paid work that was detrimental to their studies. \"We consider the government unwisely put aside Dearing's recommendations for a graduate contribution and chose an approach which has become unpopular in Scotland . We are clear\u00c9 that the present arrangements are broadly discredited, add to anxieties about debt and create undue anomalies.\" The up-front contribution ought to go, but graduates ought to contribute to the costs of their education, argues the report. \"We are not persuaded that a principle of free education should apply in all circumstances. Indeed, fairness suggests that those who gain from higher education should make an appropriate and timely contribution in respect of the benefits gained. After all, these benefits are significant and not available to all. \"To ensure graduates who benefit from higher education make a contribution towards its future costs, we propose a Scottish Graduate Endowment. However, full-time further and higher education students, other than postgraduates, should have the opportunity to attend college or university without paying tuition fees .\" From 2001, it recommends, students would contract to pay into the endowment fund when their income reaches \u00a325,000. The report sets a total figure of \u00a33,075 to match what current students have to pay. Cubie also blamed Blunkett for not following the lead of Edinburgh ministers and waiving fees for the fourth year of Scottish degree courses. It was up to him to sort out the anomaly, not the Scots: \"The decision by ministers elsewhere in the UK not to respect this principle on the issue of the fourth-year anomaly led to a discrediting of tuition fees in Scotland . This in turn led, through the political process, to the case for abolition of the tuition fee contribution being put so strongly.\" Blunkett has no intention of spending a penny of his budget on sorting out Scottish anomalies, but any implementation of the Cubie proposals will lead to embarrassing comparisons and could well reopen the fees debate in England, which the government thought it had dealt with. It is not only that students from England will be paying \u00a31,025 more than their Scottish colleagues to study at Scottish universities, and having to pay it upfront. The result is likely to be fewer incoming students. The most recent figures from the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service showed a 5% fall in applications from English students, 13% from Wales, and more than 4% from Northern Ireland. (The number of Scots who wanted to study in their own country fell by just 1.8%.) Indeed, one well-respected physics department in Scotland is already rewriting its four-year course into three years in response to a drastic fall in applications from over the border. More vital in political terms to Blunkett and other members of the Blair government is whether Scotland comes up with a better system for promoting the increase in participation they have set their sights on. Cubie's case against fees is that they deter the people from poor backgrounds that New Labour wants to draw into the educational fold. Not only should fees be scrapped, but money should be redirected away from loans to well-off families and targeted on bursaries for the poor. In other words, grants should be restored under another name. Although 40% of Scotland 's 140,000 full-time higher education students pay no fees at all and a further 30% pay a reduced fee, the Cubie committee was convinced their existence was a deterrent to \"loan averse\" low-income families and mature students. In England, ministers have argued strongly that fees have had no effect on applications, although they have had to admit a drop among mature students. Perhaps it is too soon to judge, but there has certainly been no significant expansion in numbers of people coming forward from the working class and ethnic minority families the government wants to attract. At the same time, there are growing complaints from universities with a lot of these sort of students that financial hardship is making their drop-out rates worse. Labour's majority at Westminster is too large for ministers to need to appease the Liberal Democrats, but Cubie's argument that students from low-income backgrounds will need financial help both at further education college and at university through special bursary schemes will strike a chord with English universities and students. For an \"education, education, education\" government, that could be embarrassing. One of the most significant features of the report is that, although media coverage has centred on university fees, half the discussion and recommendations are about further education colleges - the vital step on the ladder to increased participation. But will Cubie's proposals fare any better in the political arena than Lord Dearing's voluminous report on higher education? Ministers in Scotland are sceptical that Cubie's proposals could be delivered for the \u00a362m extra he claims, rising in subsequent years to pounds 71m, and universities are anxious they could simply lose the fee income without gaining anything in return.

      "body": "<p>Every developed country is struggling to keep pace with the intellectual arms race. They know that if they don't educate more of their citizens to a higher level, they'll fall behind; but they also know there are limits to what taxpayers are willing to shell out for students.</p> <p>It's a perennial issue, which seemed to have quietened down again in Britain once David Blunkett settled on paid tuition fees in the year after Labour was elected. But now it's come charging back up the agenda, and in a way that will probably affect students throughout the United Kingdom.</p> <p>Shortly before Christmas, a report to the Scottish Parliament on student finance was produced in response to the furious political row north of the border over tuition fees and student loans. This week, a small group of Labour and Liberal Democrat politicians are trying to thrash out a deal based on the report, to save their ruling coalition in Edinburgh. They have not got much time - in two weeks it is the Scottish Nationalists' turn to choose the subject of debate in the Parliament, and the executive is under pressure to agree a policy by then.</p> <p>But that battle for short-term tactical advantage at Holyrood will have consequences that reverberate far beyond Edinburgh. For the committee chaired by Edinburgh lawyer Andrew Cubie has tried to find a Scottish answer for a global phenomenon - the continuing pressure on funding for higher education. \"Set against a widespread expansion of participation, the main policy issue facing student support for further and higher education is how to bring in private money to the sectors.\"</p> <p>Scotland has taken participation further than the rest of Britain: 47% of young people, and half of all young women, go on to higher education there. But the problem is especially acute for a small nation that is determined to hang on to its four-year degrees.</p> <p>New Labour's answer to the problem was announced in the heady weeks after the 1997 general election victory: means-tested annual tuition fees of \u00a31,000 (this year \u00a31,025) to be paid upfront while students can borrow from the Student Loans Company to cover fees and living costs up to a maximum of \u00a33,635 a year. Repayment starts when the graduate's income reaches \u00a310,000 a year. Crucially, Labour completed the phasing out of grants which the Conservatives began. Blunkett, as incoming education secretary, ignored the recommendations of the Dearing committee to keep some grants and levy contributions from graduates along the lines of the Australian Higher Education Contributions Scheme.</p> <p>Public meetings throughout Scotland and a mass of written evidence left Cubie and his committee in little doubt that fees were extremely unpopular in Scotland and the parental or student contribution ought to be abolished. </p> <p>His report makes uncomfortable reading for Blunkett. The system for funding students was \"ineffective, insufficient and indecipherable\" and many students were taking on high levels of additional paid work that was detrimental to their studies. \"We consider the government unwisely put aside Dearing's recommendations for a graduate contribution and chose an approach which has become unpopular in Scotland. We are clear . . . that the present arrangements are broadly discredited, add to anxieties about debt and create undue anomalies.\"</p> <p>The up-front contribution ought to go, but graduates ought to contribute to the costs of their education, argues the report. \"We are not persuaded that a principle of free education should apply in all circumstances. Indeed, fairness suggests that those who gain from higher education should make an appropriate and timely contribution in respect of the benefits gained. After all, these benefits are significant and not available to all.</p> <p>\"To ensure graduates who benefit from higher education make a contribution towards its future costs, we propose a Scottish Graduate Endowment.</p> <p>However, full-time further and higher education students, other than postgraduates, should have the opportunity to attend college or university without paying tuition fees.\"</p> <p>From 2001, it recommends, students would contract to pay into the endowment fund when their income reaches \u00a325,000. The report sets a total figure of \u00a33,075 to match what current students have to pay. </p> <p>Cubie also blamed Blunkett for not following the lead of Edinburgh ministers and waiving fees for the fourth year of Scottish degree courses. It was up to him to sort out the anomaly, not the Scots: \"The decision by ministers elsewhere in the UK not to respect this principle on the issue of the fourth-year anomaly led to a discrediting of tuition fees in Scotland. This in turn led, through the political process, to the case for abolition of the tuition fee contribution being put so strongly.\"</p> <p>Blunkett has no intention of spending a penny of his budget on sorting out Scottish anomalies, but any implementation of the Cubie proposals will lead to embarrassing comparisons and could well reopen the fees debate in England, which the government thought it had dealt with.</p> <p>It is not only that students from England will be paying \u00a31,025 more than their Scottish colleagues to study at Scottish universities, and having to pay it upfront. The result is likely to be fewer incoming students. The most recent figures from the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service showed a 5% fall in applications from English students, 13% from Wales, and more than 4% from Northern Ireland. (The number of Scots who wanted to study in their own country fell by just 1.8%.) </p> <p>Indeed, one well-respected physics department in Scotland is already rewriting its four-year course into three years in response to a drastic fall in applications from over the border.</p> <p>More vital in political terms to Blunkett and other members of the Blair government is whether Scotland comes up with a better system for promoting the increase in participation they have set their sights on. Cubie's case against fees is that they deter the people from poor backgrounds that New Labour wants to draw into the educational fold. Not only should fees be scrapped, but money should be redirected away from loans to well-off families and targeted on bursaries for the poor. In other words, grants should be restored under another name.</p> <p>Although 40% of Scotland's 140,000 full-time higher education students pay no fees at all and a further 30% pay a reduced fee, the Cubie committee was convinced their existence was a deterrent to \"loan averse\" low-income families and mature students. </p> <p>In England, ministers have argued strongly that fees have had no effect on applications, although they have had to admit a drop among mature students. Perhaps it is too soon to judge, but there has certainly been no significant expansion in numbers of people coming forward from the working class and ethnic minority families the government wants to attract. At the same time, there are growing complaints from universities with a lot of these sort of students that financial hardship is making their drop-out rates worse. </p> <p>Labour's majority at Westminster is too large for ministers to need to appease the Liberal Democrats, but Cubie's argument that students from low-income backgrounds will need financial help both at further education college and at university through special bursary schemes will strike a chord with English universities and students. For an \"education, education, education\" government, that could be embarrassing. </p> <p>One of the most significant features of the report is that, although media coverage has centred on university fees, half the discussion and recommendations are about further education colleges - the vital step on the ladder to increased participation.</p> <p>But will Cubie's proposals fare any better in the political arena than Lord Dearing's voluminous report on higher education? Ministers in Scotland are sceptical that Cubie's proposals could be delivered for the \u00a362m extra he claims, rising in subsequent years to \u00a371m, and universities areanxious they could simply lose the fee income without gaining anything in return. On the other hand, Tories have condemned the proposals as simply converting tuition fees into a tuition tax and some LibDems regard the graduate payments as deferred fees.</p> <p>The deal, therefore, is by no means done. But, as a senior Scottish Liberal Democrat backbencher put it: \"Fees are dead - or else the coalition is dead.\"</p> <p><strong>The main ideas</strong></p> <p>Among the report's 52 recommendations are: <br>\u0095Abolish tuition fees for Scottish domiciled students - the Scottish Executive to pick up the estimated \u00a312m shortfall to the sector. <br>\u0095 Set up the Scottish Graduate Endowment -all Scottish domiciled and European Union students starting courses from October 2001 will sign a contract to pay \u00a33,075 to the fund once their graduate salary tops \u00a325,000. Ministers should consider early payment incentives. <br>\u0095 Ministers in England, Wales and Northern Ireland should waive fourth-year fees for Scottish universities as a matter of urgency. <br>\u0095 A new body, Student Finance Scotland, to collect and take over wide-ranging responsibilities for student support. <br>\u0095 A charitable trust, the Scottish Graduate Endowment Foundation, to provide additional support for higher and further education students, receiving donations from existing graduates, firms or members of the public. <br>\u0095 Students genuinely unable to find work during the summer vacation should have access to benefits. <br>\u0095 Support for students increased to \u00a34,100 (away from home), \u00a33,240 (living at home) and \u00a35,050 (in London). <br>\u0095 Review support for further education students. <br>\u0095 Students should be limited to maximum of 10 hours a week paid work in term time. <br>\u0095 Three years' bursary support in FE college/school for young people from low-income backgrounds, plus bursaries in higher education equal to half the total support available. <br>\u0095 Childcare allowance of \u00a31,500 for lone-parent students. <br>\u0095 Disabled student allowance to be open to all higher education students. <br>\u0095 Review means test - low- and middle-income parents to pay less and better off pay more. <br>\u0095 Wider Access and Mature Students' bursary schemes to target non-repayable support to particularly disadvantaged students - schemes administered by universities and colleges and would absorb current Access Funds. <br>\u0095 Better information for prospective students on the internet and in libraries. <br>\u0095 Tax breaks as incentives for people to contribute to Individual Learning Accounts. <br>\u0095 Review support for postgraduate students. </p> <p>The report of the independent commitee of inquiry into student finance is available on www.studentfinance.org.uk.

This in turn led, through the political process, to the case for abolition of the tuition fee contribution being put so strongly.\" Blunkett has no intention of spending a penny of his budget on sorting out Scottish anomalies, but any implementation of the Cubie proposals will lead to embarrassing comparisons and could well reopen the fees debate in England, which the government thought it had dealt with. It is not only that students from England will be paying \u00a31,025 more than their Scottish colleagues to study at Scottish universities, and having to pay it upfront. The result is likely to be fewer incoming students. The most recent figures from the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service showed a 5% fall in applications from English students, 13% from Wales, and more than 4% from Northern Ireland. (The number of Scots who wanted to study in their own country fell by just 1.8%.) Indeed, one well-respected physics department in Scotland is already rewriting its four-year course into three years in response to a drastic fall in applications from over the border. More vital in political terms to Blunkett and other members of the Blair government is whether Scotland comes up with a better system for promoting the increase in participation they have set their sights on. Cubie's case against fees is that they deter the people from poor backgrounds that New Labour wants to draw into the educational fold. Not only should fees be scrapped, but money should be redirected away from loans to well-off families and targeted on bursaries for the poor. In other words, grants should be restored under another name. Although 40% of Scotland's 140,000 full-time higher education students pay no fees at all and a further 30% pay a reduced fee, the Cubie committee was convinced their existence was a deterrent to \"loan averse\" low-income families and mature students. In England, ministers have argued strongly that fees have had no effect on applications, although they have had to admit a drop among mature students. Perhaps it is too soon to judge, but there has certainly been no significant expansion in numbers of people coming forward from the working class and ethnic minority families the government wants to attract. At the same time, there are growing complaints from universities with a lot of these sort of students that financial hardship is making their drop-out rates worse. Labour's majority at Westminster is too large for ministers to need to appease the Liberal Democrats, but Cubie's argument that students from low-income backgrounds will need financial help both at further education college and at university through special bursary schemes will strike a chord with English universities and students. For an \"education, education, education\" government, that could be embarrassing. One of the most significant features of the report is that, although media coverage has centred on university fees, half the discussion and recommendations are about further education colleges - the vital step on the ladder to increased participation. But will Cubie's proposals fare any better in the political arena than Lord Dearing's voluminous report on higher education? Ministers in Scotland are sceptical that Cubie's proposals could be delivered for the \u00a362m extra he claims, rising in subsequent years to \u00a371m, and universities areanxious they could simply lose the fee income without gaining anything in return. On the other hand, Tories have condemned the proposals as simply converting tuition fees into a tuition tax and some LibDems regard the graduate payments as deferred fees. The deal, therefore, is by no means done. But, as a senior Scottish Liberal Democrat backbencher put it: \"Fees are dead - or else the coalition is dead.\" The main ideas Among the report's 52 recommendations are: \u0095Abolish tuition fees for Scottish domiciled students - the Scottish Executive to pick up the estimated \u00a312m shortfall to the sector. \u0095 Set up the Scottish Graduate Endowment -all Scottish domiciled and European Union students starting courses from October 2001 will sign a contract to pay \u00a33,075 to the fund once their graduate salary tops \u00a325,000. Ministers should consider early payment incentives. \u0095 Ministers in England, Wales and Northern Ireland should waive fourth-year fees for Scottish universities as a matter of urgency. \u0095 A new body, Student Finance Scotland, to collect and take over wide-ranging responsibilities for student support. \u0095 A charitable trust, the Scottish Graduate Endowment Foundation, to provide additional support for higher and further education students, receiving donations from existing graduates, firms or members of the public. \u0095 Students genuinely unable to find work during the summer vacation should have access to benefits. \u0095 Support for students increased to \u00a34,100 (away from home), \u00a33,240 (living at home) and \u00a35,050 (in London). \u0095 Review support for further education students. \u0095 Students should be limited to maximum of 10 hours a week paid work in term time. \u0095 Three years' bursary support in FE college/school for young people from low-income backgrounds, plus bursaries in higher education equal to half the total support available. \u0095 Childcare allowance of \u00a31,500 for lone-parent students. \u0095 Disabled student allowance to be open to all higher education students. \u0095 Review means test - low- and middle-income parents to pay less and better off pay more. \u0095 Wider Access and Mature Students' bursary schemes to target non-repayable support to particularly disadvantaged students - schemes administered by universities and colleges and would absorb current Access Funds. \u0095 Better information for prospective students on the internet and in libraries. \u0095 Tax breaks as incentives for people to contribute to Individual Learning Accounts. \u0095 Review support for postgraduate students. The report of the independent commitee of inquiry into student finance is available on www.studentfinance.org.uk.

      "body": "<p><strong>EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT... BEN THATCHER'S ELBOW</strong></p> <p>It's the hottest extremity in the Premiership since Paul Merson stopped inhaling through his nose, and everyone wants a piece of it. It was spotted at last month's Bond premiere on the arm of gorgeous lad's-mag adornment Caprice and, if the rumours are true, it's just signed a three album deal with Warner Brothers. But just what made Ben Thatcher's elbow so hot hot hot?</p> <p>The answer lies in a large amount of well-placed publicity, and a little forearm smash. Nicky Summerbee set it all off, with close friends saying he was \"completely floored\" by the joint in the build up to Wimbledon's winner against Sunderland. Unavailable for comment on the incident (due to swelling in the cheek region), Summerbee has instead left it to Wimbledon manager Egil Olsen to express the nation's feelings.</p> <p>\"He was running with his arms, it's impossible to put them down,\" said the Norwegian communist, who must have had a special view of the incident as Thatcher appeared to be running on his legs. \"He did hit the opponent but when you have the ball it's very difficult to punish a player.\" Who was talking about punishment? Not the FA, who have simply requested a video of the game so they can marvel at that elbow. \"We treat each case on its merits,\" said a spokesman today. If there's an elbow more meretricious the Fiver wants to hear about it.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>RIO BRAVO!</strong></p> <p>Twenty four hours into their South American odyssey and already things appear to be going a bit wrong for Manchester United. The weather is a bit sweaty, the Maracana is a building site, the entire squad has been forced to pitch camp on a hillside under a favella, the portable stoves have run out of gas, and Steve McLaren hasn't brought enough baked beans. If all that wasn't bad enough, Martin Edwards has decided he's homesick.</p> <p>\"If we had had the choice we would not have come to Brazil,\" said Money Mart today, presumably using the royal 'we', as Michael Clegg is just loving his time in the party capital of the New World. \"We had to give up the FA Cup,\" Money went on, his eyes misting up at the thought of Stanley Matthews nutmegging Charlie George in a gusty fourth-round replay at Fratton Park. \"About that we are disappointed.\"</p> <p>Observant readers will note that this is not the first time Money Mart has claimed, in a manner not too dissimilar to Oliver Stone after an all-night Democrat fundraiser, that evil forces have pushed United out of the Cup they hold dearest to their hearts. At the same time as Alex Ferguson MDF is trying to tout the Fifa Club World Championshop as the dawn of a new era as well.

I had three beers with my wife and she had a little bit of red wine. We stayed up for an hour after midnight and then went to bed. I know that's really bad.\" - Derby's new Belgian striker Branko Strupar reveals a sharp understanding of lad culture.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>MR LOGIC</strong></p> <p>There are some things football can provide you with, and some things it can't. If you want excitement, frustration and a garish replica shirt made out of material which will chafe your nipples in cold weather, then football's the game for you. But if you're after logic and common sense, then you'll have to look elsewhere.</p> <p>Take the arguments of Erik Soler, for example, the philosopher-cum-agent currently trying to secure a \u00a3500,000 transfer to FC Copenhagen for lumbering Celtic 'goalscorer' Harald Brattbakk. The Norwegian 'striker' has spent the best part of the last two years shinning sitters into the Parkhead stands, but apparently this is only because he is far too good for Scottish football. \"I don't mean to be disrespectful to the Scottish style of play,\" sniffed Soler, \"but I think it would be much better for Harald's style to play in a place like Denmark. Danish football is played on the ground.\"</p> <p>Soler suggests that such a classy \"continental\" approach will allow his client to \"show again that he is a top-quality striker\" and not a lame carthorse regularly humiliated by the likes of Steven Pressley and Shaun McSkimming. After all, he argues, this is the player who single-handedly won Celtic's only league title of the Nineties: \"How many times have Celtic been champions in the last few years? But they were champions the season Harald played regularly.\" You're right, Erik, those seven goals were important. In fact there was almost no need for the rest of the team to knock in the other 57.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>THE RUMOUR MILL</strong></p> <p>Derby are interested in Celtic defender Jackie McNamara. The Scottish international will be available for free at the end of the season under the Bosman ruling.</p> <p>Brentford defender Darren Powell has been attracting the attention of several Premiership clubs, including Arsenal and Aston Villa, who sent a scout to watch the Bees' defeat against Stoke at the weekend.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>NEWS IN BRIEF</strong></p> <p>Manchester United are now 9-4 joint favourites alongside Corinthians to win the Fifa Club World Championshop, moving in from 3-1. Meanwhile, United are laying yet another pitch at Old Trafford. The bulldozers move in tomorrow to replace the whole playing area for the third time since the summer and the sixth since 1998.</p> <p>The Scottish FA have ruled out the prospect of playing Yugoslavia in a friendly before their World Cup 2002 campaign. Scotland manager Craig Brown had indicated that he felt Yugoslavia would be ideal opponents to gear up for meeting Croatia in competitive action. But the SFA have played down the possibility of a game being arranged after the potential political problems of any match were highlighted.</p> <p>Brighton's Darren Freeman is to be given a special award for scoring the first goal of the millennium in English professional football.

      "bodyText": "EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT... BEN THATCHER'S ELBOW It's the hottest extremity in the Premiership since Paul Merson stopped inhaling through his nose, and everyone wants a piece of it. It was spotted at last month's Bond premiere on the arm of gorgeous lad's-mag adornment Caprice and, if the rumours are true, it's just signed a three album deal with Warner Brothers. But just what made Ben Thatcher's elbow so hot hot hot? The answer lies in a large amount of well-placed publicity, and a little forearm smash. Nicky Summerbee set it all off, with close friends saying he was \"completely floored\" by the joint in the build up to Wimbledon's winner against Sunderland. Unavailable for comment on the incident (due to swelling in the cheek region), Summerbee has instead left it to Wimbledon manager Egil Olsen to express the nation's feelings. \"He was running with his arms, it's impossible to put them down,\" said the Norwegian communist, who must have had a special view of the incident as Thatcher appeared to be running on his legs. \"He did hit the opponent but when you have the ball it's very difficult to punish a player.\" Who was talking about punishment? Not the FA, who have simply requested a video of the game so they can marvel at that elbow. \"We treat each case on its merits,\" said a spokesman today. If there's an elbow more meretricious the Fiver wants to hear about it. * * * * * * * * * * * * * RIO BRAVO! Twenty four hours into their South American odyssey and already things appear to be going a bit wrong for Manchester United. The weather is a bit sweaty, the Maracana is a building site, the entire squad has been forced to pitch camp on a hillside under a favella, the portable stoves have run out of gas, and Steve McLaren hasn't brought enough baked beans. If all that wasn't bad enough, Martin Edwards has decided he's homesick. \"If we had had the choice we would not have come to Brazil,\" said Money Mart today, presumably using the royal 'we', as Michael Clegg is just loving his time in the party capital of the New World. \"We had to give up the FA Cup,\" Money went on, his eyes misting up at the thought of Stanley Matthews nutmegging Charlie George in a gusty fourth-round replay at Fratton Park. \"About that we are disappointed.\" Observant readers will note that this is not the first time Money Mart has claimed, in a manner not too dissimilar to Oliver Stone after an all-night Democrat fundraiser, that evil forces have pushed United out of the Cup they hold dearest to their hearts. At the same time as Alex Ferguson MDF is trying to tout the Fifa Club World Championshop as the dawn of a new era as well. Let's hope none of the youngsters get hooked on glue before the tournament starts. That would really cap it off. * * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"I didn't do much for New Year's Eve. I had three beers with my wife and she had a little bit of red wine. We stayed up for an hour after midnight and then went to bed. I know that's really bad.\" - Derby's new Belgian striker Branko Strupar reveals a sharp understanding of lad culture. * * * * * * * * * * * * * MR LOGIC There are some things football can provide you with, and some things it can't. If you want excitement, frustration and a garish replica shirt made out of material which will chafe your nipples in cold weather, then football's the game for you. But if you're after logic and common sense, then you'll have to look elsewhere. Take the arguments of Erik Soler, for example, the philosopher-cum-agent currently trying to secure a \u00a3500,000 transfer to FC Copenhagen for lumbering Celtic 'goalscorer' Harald Brattbakk. The Norwegian 'striker' has spent the best part of the last two years shinning sitters into the Parkhead stands, but apparently this is only because he is far too good for Scottish football. \"I don't mean to be disrespectful to the Scottish style of play,\" sniffed Soler, \"but I think it would be much better for Harald's style to play in a place like Denmark. Danish football is played on the ground.\" Soler suggests that such a classy \"continental\" approach will allow his client to \"show again that he is a top-quality striker\" and not a lame carthorse regularly humiliated by the likes of Steven Pressley and Shaun McSkimming. After all, he argues, this is the player who single-handedly won Celtic's only league title of the Nineties: \"How many times have Celtic been champions in the last few years? But they were champions the season Harald played regularly.\" You're right, Erik, those seven goals were important. In fact there was almost no need for the rest of the team to knock in the other 57. * * * * * * * * * * * * * THE RUMOUR MILL Derby are interested in Celtic defender Jackie McNamara. The Scottish international will be available for free at the end of the season under the Bosman ruling. Brentford defender Darren Powell has been attracting the attention of several Premiership clubs, including Arsenal and Aston Villa, who sent a scout to watch the Bees' defeat against Stoke at the weekend. * * * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF Manchester United are now 9-4 joint favourites alongside Corinthians to win the Fifa Club World Championshop, moving in from 3-1. Meanwhile, United are laying yet another pitch at Old Trafford. The bulldozers move in tomorrow to replace the whole playing area for the third time since the summer and the sixth since 1998. The Scottish FA have ruled out the prospect of playing Yugoslavia in a friendly before their World Cup 2002 campaign. Scotland manager Craig Brown had indicated that he felt Yugoslavia would be ideal opponents to gear up for meeting Croatia in competitive action. But the SFA have played down the possibility of a game being arranged after the potential political problems of any match were highlighted. Brighton's Darren Freeman is to be given a special award for scoring the first goal of the millennium in English professional football. Freeman scored after just two minutes in the Seagulls' 4-2 win over Exeter, and league sponsors Nationwide are to present him with a specially commissioned magnum of champagne. Birmingham's Bryan Hughes scored after 12 seconds against Huddersfield but Freeman's goal was earlier because the Brighton match was a noon kick-off. * * * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO ITV: Football Extra (1.45am) Dave Beckett.

      "body": "<p>This is the most helpless we will ever be. The patients here are mostly unconscious or sedated, lying high on their pillows, faces tilted blindly towards the ceiling while tubes and drips and feeds invade them from every angle. Syringe drivers dose their systems with drugs at timed intervals and the contents of feedbags drip through tubes into their stomachs; monitors trace heart rates, central venus pressure and blood pressure in thin coloured lines that track mountain ranges across a black screen.</p> <p>On the other side of the beds are breathing machines, flashing up digital breakdowns of breathing patterns, while tubes pass through throats, hands or arms, drugs keep hearts beating, and ventilators gently fill and empty lungs, breath by breath by breath.</p> <p>'It must look like a torture chamber if you're not used to it,' says Andrea Martin, head nurse of the intensive care unit at London's University College Hospital. 'I suppose I hardly see it any more, but I wonder what relatives think when they first get here.'</p> <p>In truth, it takes a while to make out the relatives amid the bright lights and fast-moving staff and metres and metres of tubing. Beside a bed near the nurses' station sits an elderly woman, holding tight to her unseeing husband's hand, and staring blankly beyond him. Leaning against a wall nearby, a middle-aged man watches as two nurses move gently round the bed of his relative, suctioning him. He shifts to the other foot after a while. Christmas has come and gone here, but there are no decorations on the ward.</p> <p>Few of the patients would notice anyway. The intensive care unit (ICU) is reserved for some of the sickest people in a hospital: patients suffering from multiple organ failure. When we are ill, or the body suffers some trauma, normally our own chemicals will begin the battle against the invader while the rest of the system keeps on going. But in cases of truly severe 'insult', as it is called, to the body, such as a car accident, major surgery, or severe infection, the balance between defence and attack is lost, the body starts to do battle with itself and one by one organs are damaged and, eventually, shut down in the crossfire. Lungs, heart, stomach, kidneys, liver: it's hard to believe that things we've never even seen and just assume will always work can let us down so badly.</p> <p>This is when patients are moved to the ICU: Martin says that part of the reason she came here was because she wondered where the patients who were too sick to be on the ordinary wards went. The ICU is the only place in a hospital that can support those collapsing organs and keep a patient stable enough to administer the other medical treatments they may need urgently. </p> <p>Fifty or 60 years ago none of this would have been possible: before ventilators existed to keep lungs going when the body had given up on them, a patient would have been left to die. Intensive care has been pioneered over the last half century and turned into a speciality all of its own. The invention of machines and drugs that can keep a restarted heart beating, make failed lungs breathe and force kidneys to function has kept many thousands of patients alive since.</p> <p>But, as Sara Bunkhall, head of the ICU at UCH points out, the financial pressures are immense. An ICU bed costs about \u00a31,800 a day to keep going. We count up the cost of the machines around just one bed: the ventilator \u00a320,000, each of the four syringe drivers \u00a33,000, the feeding pump \u00a35,000, the beds \u00a33,000 each, the monitoring system for the ward \u00a3500,000, a haemo (blood) filter \u00a318,000. What do these new machines do that the old ones didn't? Dr Monty Mythen points to a woman down the corridor. She sits upright in bed, a tube feeding into her throat and multiple lines running through her chest and arms, with a pair of glasses perched on her nose, reading a newspaper.</p> <p>'Fifty years ago,' says Mythen, 'she would have had to be in an iron lung. Twenty years ago she would have had to be heavily sedated.'</p> <p>The support machines being used here now are far less intrusive than the old machinery: patients can be conscious and almost comfortable while they are treated. Do the machines save lives then? As you look around at these patients, so paper-white and fragile it seems one moment more of trauma would push them beyond help, the answer must surely be yes. Some doctors say they do, and most intensivists will tell you that they can save many more lives today than they could 20 years ago.</p> <p>But, says Mythen, slowly: 'There is some evidence to suggest that they may just reduce suffering. That's something, but when it comes to health economics suffering is often acceptable if it's cheap.'</p> <p>Money, money, money. Anyone in the NHS will tell you that there's not enough of it (in Britain we spend about 6% of our gross domestic product on the health service: most other North European countries spend closer to 9%, while the United States spends more than 10%). The rate of inflation in a hospital is not the same as that of a country: the cost of machinery and drugs multiplies exponentially, not just by a few per cent every year. And while intensive care in this country is under the same financial pressure from which the rest of the NHS suffers, ICUs also put pressure on themselves by insisting on an expensive one-to-one ratio of nurses to patients.</p> <p>Detractors may suggest that the level of care in Britain is worse than Europe or North America (UCH has the largest ICU in Britain, with 22 beds, while a hospital of similar size in the US will have more than 100), but intensivists point to nurse-patient ratios elsewhere: Mythen has seen patients in the US tied to their beds to stop them dislodging tubes because they are not watched 24 hours a day.</p> <p>One-to-one care is, in the end, the reason most nurses and doctors come into this field, the reason they take on the higher mortality rates and never-ending pressure (Mythen has had nights when he has been telephoned due to an emergency every 40 minutes). The passage of a patient through this unit is different to any other: relatives need special care and attention as they watch a mother, a brother or child kept alive by pieces of plastic and metal. The daughters of Valerie Cumming, who is being ventilated after breathing difficulties on Christmas Eve, are full of praise for the staff. 'We felt involved from the beginning,' says Jane Fiona. 'They told us, and my mother, even though she was unconscious, exactly what was going on. Everyone has been so supportive, and even though there are such sad things happening here, it's oddly peaceful. We all wish each other well.'</p> <p>Nurse Martin says: 'Because patients so often come in unconscious, I often think that one of the hardest moments for them must be when they come round and realise where they are.' Behind her, a wall is covered in thank you cards from patients or relatives who have left the ward behind. The nurses stride by, capable, organised, making jokes and being rude about the hospital trust, as NHS staff are. The machines quietly tick over, steadily feeding and breathing and moving the still bodies. New Year's Eve passes, just as Christmas did. But here there are so many clocks ticking to different timescales that hardly anyone notices.</p>",

The invention of machines and drugs that can keep a restarted heart beating, make failed lungs breathe and force kidneys to function has kept many thousands of patients alive since. But, as Sara Bunkhall, head of the ICU at UCH points out, the financial pressures are immense. An ICU bed costs about \u00a31,800 a day to keep going. We count up the cost of the machines around just one bed: the ventilator \u00a320,000, each of the four syringe drivers \u00a33,000, the feeding pump \u00a35,000, the beds \u00a33,000 each, the monitoring system for the ward \u00a3500,000, a haemo (blood) filter \u00a318,000. What do these new machines do that the old ones didn't? Dr Monty Mythen points to a woman down the corridor. She sits upright in bed, a tube feeding into her throat and multiple lines running through her chest and arms, with a pair of glasses perched on her nose, reading a newspaper. 'Fifty years ago,' says Mythen, 'she would have had to be in an iron lung. Twenty years ago she would have had to be heavily sedated.' The support machines being used here now are far less intrusive than the old machinery: patients can be conscious and almost comfortable while they are treated. Do the machines save lives then? As you look around at these patients, so paper-white and fragile it seems one moment more of trauma would push them beyond help, the answer must surely be yes. Some doctors say they do, and most intensivists will tell you that they can save many more lives today than they could 20 years ago. But, says Mythen, slowly: 'There is some evidence to suggest that they may just reduce suffering. That's something, but when it comes to health economics suffering is often acceptable if it's cheap.' Money, money, money. Anyone in the NHS will tell you that there's not enough of it (in Britain we spend about 6% of our gross domestic product on the health service: most other North European countries spend closer to 9%, while the United States spends more than 10%). The rate of inflation in a hospital is not the same as that of a country: the cost of machinery and drugs multiplies exponentially, not just by a few per cent every year. And while intensive care in this country is under the same financial pressure from which the rest of the NHS suffers, ICUs also put pressure on themselves by insisting on an expensive one-to-one ratio of nurses to patients. Detractors may suggest that the level of care in Britain is worse than Europe or North America (UCH has the largest ICU in Britain, with 22 beds, while a hospital of similar size in the US will have more than 100), but intensivists point to nurse-patient ratios elsewhere: Mythen has seen patients in the US tied to their beds to stop them dislodging tubes because they are not watched 24 hours a day. One-to-one care is, in the end, the reason most nurses and doctors come into this field, the reason they take on the higher mortality rates and never-ending pressure (Mythen has had nights when he has been telephoned due to an emergency every 40 minutes). The passage of a patient through this unit is different to any other: relatives need special care and attention as they watch a mother, a brother or child kept alive by pieces of plastic and metal. The daughters of Valerie Cumming, who is being ventilated after breathing difficulties on Christmas Eve, are full of praise for the staff. 'We felt involved from the beginning,' says Jane Fiona. 'They told us, and my mother, even though she was unconscious, exactly what was going on. Everyone has been so supportive, and even though there are such sad things happening here, it's oddly peaceful. We all wish each other well.' Nurse Martin says: 'Because patients so often come in unconscious, I often think that one of the hardest moments for them must be when they come round and realise where they are.' Behind her, a wall is covered in thank you cards from patients or relatives who have left the ward behind. The nurses stride by, capable, organised, making jokes and being rude about the hospital trust, as NHS staff are. The machines quietly tick over, steadily feeding and breathing and moving the still bodies. New Year's Eve passes, just as Christmas did. But here there are so many clocks ticking to different timescales that hardly anyone notices.",

      "body": "<p><strong>Preventing a hangover</strong></p> <p><strong>Q</strong> What is the most scientific method of preventing a hangover?</p> <p><strong>A</strong> Hangovers are related to how much you drink, what you drink, and who you are. Drinking more than five units (two-and-a-half pints of beer or five glasses of wine) can lead to a hangover in most of us. Rum, brandy and whisky are more likely to cause a hangover than white wine, gin or vodka because they contain methanol, formaldehyde and formic acid which are the chemicals most likely to cause the headache and rapid heart rate of hangovers. To prevent a hangover, drink a glass of water for every alcoholic drink and line your stomach first with food. The French like a spoonful of olive oil, the Italians like a boiled potato, the Russians are said to favour half a pound of fat and the British seem to favour a bag of chips or a curry. Keep your head upright to avoid that unpleasant sensation of descending into a whirring pit when you lie down - caused by alcohol getting into the inner ear and upsetting your balance. Most hangover cures don't work, apart from paracetamol for the headache and a couple of Rennie's for the nausea. The Swiss like to breathe pure oxygen, Italians eat coffee with ash and Jamaicans rub lemons and limes under their armpits. I have no idea whether any of these traditional remedies work. </p> <p><strong>Help! I weigh 19 stone</strong></p> <p><strong>Q</strong> I'm a 32 year old man, 5ft 10in and very overweight. I weigh around 19 stone and have been told I must lose weight or risk serious illness. I've tried really hard - working out at the gym and watching what I eat, but have only managed to lose a few pounds. My GP has offered me Xenical but I don't like the sound of the side effects. What do you think?</p> <p><strong>A</strong> I'd take it if I were you.

      "bodyText": "Preventing a hangover Q What is the most scientific method of preventing a hangover? A Hangovers are related to how much you drink, what you drink, and who you are. Drinking more than five units (two-and-a-half pints of beer or five glasses of wine) can lead to a hangover in most of us. Rum, brandy and whisky are more likely to cause a hangover than white wine, gin or vodka because they contain methanol, formaldehyde and formic acid which are the chemicals most likely to cause the headache and rapid heart rate of hangovers. To prevent a hangover, drink a glass of water for every alcoholic drink and line your stomach first with food. The French like a spoonful of olive oil, the Italians like a boiled potato, the Russians are said to favour half a pound of fat and the British seem to favour a bag of chips or a curry. Keep your head upright to avoid that unpleasant sensation of descending into a whirring pit when you lie down - caused by alcohol getting into the inner ear and upsetting your balance. Most hangover cures don't work, apart from paracetamol for the headache and a couple of Rennie's for the nausea. The Swiss like to breathe pure oxygen, Italians eat coffee with ash and Jamaicans rub lemons and limes under their armpits. I have no idea whether any of these traditional remedies work. Help! I weigh 19 stone Q I'm a 32 year old man, 5ft 10in and very overweight. I weigh around 19 stone and have been told I must lose weight or risk serious illness. I've tried really hard - working out at the gym and watching what I eat, but have only managed to lose a few pounds. My GP has offered me Xenical but I don't like the sound of the side effects. What do you think? A I'd take it if I were you. Orlistat (Xenical) stops you absorbing up to a third of the fat you eat by blocking the effect of the chemicals produced by the pancreas and stomach that let you absorb fat. You take a 120mg tablet with each meal. If you don't stick to a low fat diet, you may well get oily diarrhoea and unpleasant wind - which is quite a strong incentive to stick to a healthy diet. If you take 100 very overweight people who try to stick to a low calorie diet and take more exercise, 15 of them will lose 10% of their total weight in a year. With Orlistat, this goes up to 30.

The United Cricket Board of South Africa has spent the ten years since readmission, in 1991, trying to attract a larger and wider audience to cricket. It was and is a huge task. While the white population retained a strong interest in cricket during isolation because of the strength of the provincial game, players like Graeme Pollock and rebel tours, disillusioned black youths turned to football.</p> <p>But it is not just the black and coloured communities that the authorities are targeting. They are also trying to win over women, who, according to Chris Day of the UCBSA, have an important role in cricket's future. Most of the teachers at primary school are women, and the board has trained between 300 and 500 as qualified coaches for mini cricket (the South African equivalent of Kwik Cricket). But it is not just because of their evangelical zeal that they are being targeted: the board genuinely seems to want a more inclusive game.</p> <p>The crowd watching the second Test at Port Elizabeth, historically the most racially mixed of all the grounds in South Africa, contained a substantial number of women. There was certainly a far larger female presence among the South African fans than among the Barmy Army, or even Test Match crowds in England. Sitting high in the Grandstand, next to the St George's band, were a group of cricket friends: Charmaine, 46, Ellen, 46, and her daughter Lucinda, 17; Ursula, 45, and her daughter Nyree, 13. All black women from Port Elizabeth who are cricket mad and who come to St George's whenever there is a major game.</p> <p> 'We have known each other for years', says Charmaine. 'And though we might not see each other for ages we know that when we come to the cricket we will always meet.' 'We always sit here, next to the band', says Ellen. 'We meet such a lot of people and have a really enjoyable day. A lot has changed since readmission. More coloureds are attending matches, and blacks and whites are starting to mix. It is certainly more mixed in this stand than it used to be. We are all supporting South Africa and accommodate each other.'</p> <p>The women feel completely at ease at the ground and say they are never made to feel stupid or patronised by men in the crowd. And, unlike in England, there is nothing unusual about a group of women coming to a match without male company.</p> <p>Chris Day again: 'Market surveys now show that 35% of people who watch cricket on television or at the ground are women. And if for some reason a match is not shown on television or coverage stops early, the TV companies are inundated by phone calls, the majority of them from women.'</p> <p>What do they like best about a day at the cricket?

      "bodyText": "The 1990s weren't just a decade of evangelism for the Church of England. The United Cricket Board of South Africa has spent the ten years since readmission, in 1991, trying to attract a larger and wider audience to cricket. It was and is a huge task. While the white population retained a strong interest in cricket during isolation because of the strength of the provincial game, players like Graeme Pollock and rebel tours, disillusioned black youths turned to football. But it is not just the black and coloured communities that the authorities are targeting. They are also trying to win over women, who, according to Chris Day of the UCBSA, have an important role in cricket's future. Most of the teachers at primary school are women, and the board has trained between 300 and 500 as qualified coaches for mini cricket (the South African equivalent of Kwik Cricket). But it is not just because of their evangelical zeal that they are being targeted: the board genuinely seems to want a more inclusive game. The crowd watching the second Test at Port Elizabeth, historically the most racially mixed of all the grounds in South Africa, contained a substantial number of women. There was certainly a far larger female presence among the South African fans than among the Barmy Army, or even Test Match crowds in England. Sitting high in the Grandstand, next to the St George's band, were a group of cricket friends: Charmaine, 46, Ellen, 46, and her daughter Lucinda, 17; Ursula, 45, and her daughter Nyree, 13. All black women from Port Elizabeth who are cricket mad and who come to St George's whenever there is a major game. 'We have known each other for years', says Charmaine. 'And though we might not see each other for ages we know that when we come to the cricket we will always meet.' 'We always sit here, next to the band', says Ellen. 'We meet such a lot of people and have a really enjoyable day. A lot has changed since readmission. More coloureds are attending matches, and blacks and whites are starting to mix. It is certainly more mixed in this stand than it used to be. We are all supporting South Africa and accommodate each other.' The women feel completely at ease at the ground and say they are never made to feel stupid or patronised by men in the crowd. And, unlike in England, there is nothing unusual about a group of women coming to a match without male company. Chris Day again: 'Market surveys now show that 35% of people who watch cricket on television or at the ground are women. And if for some reason a match is not shown on television or coverage stops early, the TV companies are inundated by phone calls, the majority of them from women.' What do they like best about a day at the cricket? 'Everything', shouts Nyree. 'The fours and sixes of Lance Klusener, being away from home and having a peaceful and restful day. Our favourites are Zulu, who was fantastic today [the second day of his 175] and Jonty.' Ellen stops singing for a minute to interject, 'And don't forget the captain. My husband died twenty years ago but when I see Hansie I wish I was young again...' Not everything is hunky-dory. The women complain that there are far too few matches at Port Elizabeth, that there are no day/nighters and no big screens on which to watch replays. But these women have a passion for cricket which relatively few of their counterparts in Britain have. Perhaps it is the weather, the success of South Africa, the party atmosphere at the ground or the wonderful music of the Port Elizabeth Brass Band, but whatever it is the ECB should bottle it and send out a free sample to every woman in the country in time for the 2000 season.

Konrad Kalejs, 86, is believed to be planning to pre-empt government moves to deport him by leaving Britain voluntarily on Thursday. But campaigners said the police were continuing to investigate allegations that he was second-in-command of a unit responsible for murdering 30,000 people in Latvia during the second world war. Pressure was also being put on the foreign office and Latvian authorities to try to ensure that if Mr Kalejs leaves the UK he will face justice abroad. Lord Janner, chairman of the Holocaust Educational Trust, emerged from a meeting with home secretary Jack Straw today to declare: \"This is not the end.\" He said the trust hoped to meet Scotland Yard assistant commissioner David Veness as soon as possible to discuss the investigations. Meetings were also being planned with the Latvian ambassador to Britain to discuss extraditing Mr Kalejs to the country where his alleged crimes took place, and with foreign secretary Robin Cook to consider the role Britain could play in a possible prosecution overseas. Lord Janner said he believed the police had carried out a \"proper and satisfactory\" review of the evidence against Mr Kalejs before deciding there were insufficient grounds to arrest him. He added that he was very happy the investigations were continuing. David Sunberg MEP, another trust member who met Mr Straw today, expressed dismay at the brevity of the police investigation and the decision to begin deportation proceedings. Mr Sunberg said police usually spent years investigating allegations before deciding whether or not to prosecute a suspected war criminal. The decision to deport was \"gesture politics\" which, given that Mr Kalejs was leaving voluntarily, underlined the lack of action being taken by the government. Mr Straw yesterday served Mr Kalejs with notice that he intended to deport him to Australia, where he has held a passport since 1957, giving him seven days to make representations. Shadow home secretary Ann Widdecombe demanded a public statement from Mr Straw on whether the police investigation was complete and whether there were outstanding areas of investigation. \"It would be a real betrayal of justice and human rights if Konrad Kalejs were to be prematurely deported and then new evidence were to be uncovered.\" It is alleged that Mr Kalejs was second in command of a notorious Latvian secret police unit, the Arajs Kommando, responsible for murdering more than 30,000 people, primarily Jews, during the second world war. Mr Kalejs has dismissed his accusers as \"liars and storytellers\". He arrived in Britain six months ago after being deported from Canada and the US and has been staying at Catthorpe Manor, Lutterworth, a retirement home run by the Latvian Welfare Fund. The Australian authorities have pledged to consider any new evidence if he returns to the country. The decision to deport Mr Kalejs has been criticised by the Simon Wiesenthal Centre in Jerusalem, which first exposed his whereabouts and has warned that a successful prosecution is unlikely to be brought against him anywhere in the world.

      "bodyText": "The much-hyped millennium bug failed to wreak any kind of chaos as Britain got back to work today, although bug watchers cautioned that Y2K computer problems could yet emerge. Robin Guenier, head of Taskforce 2000, the independent bug watchdog, said just 5% of all potential bug problems were likely to occur at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve. \"I am more concerned about databases and billing systems and general administrative systems which are vital to businesses. I am concerned whether they have had the same attention as other things,\" he said. The private sector, the banking system and the London stock exchange all reported a clean bill of health, although fears of imminent interest rate increases caused shares to plummet 229 points in the first few hours of trading. A Scottish hospital where a kidney dialysis machine suffered a computer failure - possibly caused by the millennium bug - today revealed another machine had also malfunctioned. Monklands District Hospital, in Airdrie, near Glasgow, said two of the machines had suffered a malfunction at midnight on January 1, not one, as had earlier been reported. An investigation was under way into how the machines suffered the failure, and if it was related to the bug. Millennium bug minister Margaret Beckett has dismissed claims that the crisis had been over-hyped, saying Britain owed a \"great debt of gratitude\" to those who had helped avoid a New Year computer crisis. But Mrs Beckett said the virtually bug-free weekend had been the result of years of hard work and money well spent. \"Things don't go right by accident,\" she said. \"People across the world have found all kinds of date change faults in business and public services which, as a result of money, effort and time, have been fixed. \"I think we owe a great debt of gratitude to those people who have worked flat out over the last two years to make sure that we have up to now had a peaceful transition in to the year 2000.\" The government's millennium centre continued to report business as usual in departments and key public services on Monday. The government has spent about \u00a3430 million while private industry is thought to have spent about \u00a320 billion fixing the bug and preparing contingency plans in case the worst happened. Technology advisers Gartner Group estimate that worldwide governments and industry have spent up to \u00a3360 billion.",

Zaidi began the destruction with 9-45 as Vidarbha were skittled for 98 in their first innings, and then claimed 6-147 in a second innings of 331 (Alind Naidu 118*). In between, Uttar Pradesh racked up 404, with 112 from Mohammad Kaif, and 95 from Rizwan Shamshad.</p> <p>There was another fine bowling display in the drawn West Zone game at Pune, where Maharashtra bowler Iqbal Siddiqui took 8-72 in Saurashtra's first innings of 217. And he might have had nine had not Manoj Parmar retired hurt for 58. Kaushik Aphale then hit 158 as Maharashtra replied strongly with 431, but Saurashtra closed on 374 for 5 in their second innings (Shitanshu Kotak 126) to force a draw. Siddiqui finished with ten in the match after taking 2-92.</p> <p>Yet another bowler starred in Assam's innings-and-56-run crushing of Tripura at Mangoldoi in the East Zone. Left-arm medium-pacer Gautam Dutta returned first-innings figures of 11.3-3-23-8 as Tripura were humbled for 57. Assam were then reduced to 58 for 6, but were rescued by some good late-order hitting, especially from No.10 Sukhbinder Singh, who blasted a scintillating 73 from 68 balls, with five fours and five sixes, to raise the total to 249. Tripura then folded again, for 136, as Dutta added two more wickets to make it ten in the match.</p> <p>Two former Test batsmen helped Mumbai to a comfortable ten-wicket win against Gujarat at Surat in the West Zone. Replying to Gujarat's 305 (Paras Mhambrey 4-71), Mumbai totalled 419, thanks to 173 from opener Wasim Jaffer and 116 by Vinod Kambli. Mhambrey then added four more wickets as Gujarat stumbled to 167, and the Mumbai openers did the rest. In the other West Zone match, Tamil Nadu forced Hyderabad to follow on, but 135 from opener Ammanabrole Nandakrishore and 69 from ex-Indian captain Mohammad Azharuddin ensured a draw; Azha had earlier made 84 in the first innings.</p> <p>In the South Zone at Kakinda, the reigning champions Karnataka won a close game against Andhra by 46 runs. Set 191 to win in the fourth innings, Andhra were bowled out for 144 by the medium-pace of Mansoor Ali Khan, who took 6-47. At Margao, Kerala trounced Goa by ten wickets, with legspinner Suresh Kumar returning first-innings figures of 18-10-21-5.</p> <p>Twin centuries from Orissa batsman Pravanjan Mullick weren't enough to defeat Bengal at Cuttack.Mullick hit 108 and 111*, but Rohan Gavaskar replied with 115 as the game finished in a draw. Railways drew with Rajasthan in the Central Zone at Delhi.</p> <p><strong>Australia</strong> </p> <p>Queensland moved up to third in the one-day Mercantile Mutual Cup table ahead of Victoria, whom they thrashed by eight wickets in a day/night game at the Gabba. Victoria were dismissed for 193 as Michael Kasprowicz claimed 3-29, before Queensland made mincemeat of their target, romping home with almost 19 overs to spare. Matthew Hayden hit 78*, and added 125 for the second wicket with Stuart Law, who scored 60. Andrew Symonds provided a flourish at the end with an unbeaten 45 off just 31 balls. Damien Fleming had figures of 10-2-50-0, while Shane Warne was battered to the tune of 6-0-43-1.</p> <p>New South Wales were still top of the table with 5 points from 4 games, followed by Western Australia (4 points, 2 games), Queensland (4,4), Victoria (4,5), South Australia (3,3), Tasmania (2,2) and Canberra (0,2).</p> <p><strong>South Africa</strong> </p> <p>In the latest round of the one-day Standard Bank competition, KwaZulu-Natal overcame Western Province by 39 runs at Cape Town. Natal opened with 214 for 5 from their 45 overs, with Dale Benkenstein hitting 78* after being dropped on 6 and 10. Lance Klusener biffed a quickfire unbeaten 48, and Alan Dawson took 3-24. WP were well-placed at 137 for 2 in reply, but lost their last eight wickets in 8.2 overs for 48 runs, as Eldine Baptiste finished with 3-33. </p> <p>It was a case of nightmare at Port Elizabeth for North West who were bowled out 140 by Eastern Province seamer Garnett Kruger, who claimed 6-23. EP cruised to victory, reaching 141 for 4 in 33.4 overs.</p> <p>At East London, Border lost four wickets with the score on 75 and were eventually dismissed for 123 by Boland, who got home for the loss of six wickets. The match between Easterns and Northerns was ruined by rain. </p> <p><strong>New Zealand</strong> </p> <p>The one-day 50-over-a-side Shell Cup got under way this week, with the six sides playing two games each. The early leaders were Auckland, who began with a four-wicket win against Wellington at Eden Park. Wellington were hurried out for 111, after crumbling from 79 for 2, as Adams took 3-3 from 22 balls. Auckland tottered themselves, declining from 62 for 1 to 99 for 6, but won with more than ten overs to spare. </p> <p>They followed that win with another, more comfortable victory over Central Districts. Adams again starred, taking 5-20 from his 10 overs as CD scraped together 123, before Auckland got to their target for the loss of just one wicket with almost 17 overs to spare.</p> <p>Second in the table, on run-rate, are Canterbury. They beat Otago by five wickets at Christchurch, winning off the penultimate ball as they chased 241. Chris Harris steered Canterbury to victory with an undefeated 90, after Doody had hit 95. Otago captain Robert Lawson had earlier scored 74 in his side's total of 240 for 4. Canterbury then saw off Northern Districts by 20 runs at Blake Park, with 70 from Englefield and 59 from Doody.

It's a tradition dating back to Woody Allen obsessing over a teenage Mariel Hemingway in the 70s hit Manhattan.

Sharon Stone, 41, lamented the lack of leading roles for women her age in a recent interview. It's as if the Hollywood establishment gets queasy at the idea of casting a fortysomething as a sexual being, she said. And this is Sharon Stone, venerated as one of the great beauties of our time.

Late-thirtysomethings such as Jodie Foster and Kristin Scott Thomas must be glumly anticipating their transition from leading ladies to playing Gwyneth Paltrow's mother.</p> <p>An actress's life as a leading lady is compressed into a few short years. The goalposts may have shifted since the old days of Hollywood, when 30 was the cut-off between glamour and character parts, but as Stone says, even the biggest stars are powerless in the face of the passage of time</p> <p>So what about some role reversal? What if, say, the upcoming romantic blockbuster The End Of The Affair had teamed its 37-year-old star, Ralph Fiennes, with his real-life partner, the frankly middle-aged Francesca Annis? Yuk, Harrison Ford says: 'If it was an older woman and a younger man, that wouldn't be too much like real life.' Well, not real life as you know it, Harrison. But you'd look a sight more dignified with a woman your own age.</p> <p>It's ludicrous that an unmade bed like Caine can make demands about the age of his co-stars and be taken seriously.

The answer - apart from a change of attitude in which elderly actors see how implausible May-December romances are to viewers - could be that actresses turn down improbable scripts.

      "body": "<p>\"He drew constantly - always carried a sketchbook, usually a publisher's 'dummy' - but, failing that, he drew on envelopes or the backs of cigarette boxes. Even his letters had drawings all over - I grew up thinking all correspondence was illustrated: when I went away to school I was surprised by the dull letters all the other girls received. Pa was always drawing. We just took it for granted - it was what he did.\" </p> <p>Christianna Clemence is talking about her father, Edward Ardizzone. His self-portrait hangs on the wall behind her and bears quite a resemblance to her young grandson, Tom, who's visiting, and who waits patiently as we talk. </p> <p>Edward Ardizzone (1900-1979) was one of the best-known, best-loved and most influential and important of all 20th century illustrators. Astonishingly prolific, his work includes watercolours, oils, prints, magazine illustrations including those for the Radio Times (which, in its heyday, was a marvellous showcase for illustrators) and, on a larger scale, the famous lithographs for the old J Lyons teashops, posters and even murals for an ocean liner. And, of course, he was a distinguished war artist. He illustrated more than 180 books - from Shakespeare, Dickens, Galsworthy to Walter de la Mare, Eleanor Farjeon and a delightful autobiography - and is perhaps best known for his Little Tim books, which grew from the stories he told Christianna and her brother as children. </p> <p>They lived in London and Christianna - now 70 and a hugely entertaining storyteller herself - paints a vivid picture of the family home in Maida Vale, whose streets, shops, pubs, parks and raffish local characters are recorded with such affectionate relish in Ardizzone's work. Ardizzone worked at home; he had been a clerk in his father's firm, forever embellishing the accounts with drawings and doodles, and attending life classes at Westminster School of Art in the evenings, but he gave up that job to become a professional artist. </p> <p>\"He started with book jackets,\" says Christianna, \"but money was scarce, so Ma, who was very beautiful and very tall, got a job as a fashion model and Pa looked after us at home while he worked. The house smelled deliciously of turpentine, and he sat at his desk up on a model's throne, on the first floor. With no garden, and a very dark nursery, my brother and I just larked around the studio; mostly he ignored our squabbles and screams, but he'd attend to the odd splinter, and now and again he'd say 'please don't lean out of the window!' or 'please don't climb on the roof'.\" </p> <p>And did you obey? \"Of course not - we couldn't hear him, anyway, if we were out on the roof. But it was perfectly safe - one of those huge Victorian houses where behind the parapet you could get access to all the different levels,\" she says briskly (and for a moment I wonder where her grandson has got to). And did he prepare your meals? \"Oh, yes, he was a much better cook than our mother! Usually it was semolina and pineapple chunks... and he'd take us out to the park to play, and sometimes I walked down to the framers with him when he had exhibitions at the Leger Gallery. He read to us a lot at bedtime, but we'd always end up asking for \"real stories\" - ie, the ones he made up himself, and he'd say: 'Well, now ... let's see ... how does it go?' \" </p> <p>So with these exemplary \"parenting skills\" was he an early version of \"new man\"? \"Absolutely not! Very old-fashioned in his ideas about women... no question of girls going to university - you just had to hope to get married!\" </p> <p>And, indeed, Christianna, as a little girl, had elaborate plans to secure a comfortable future by making friends with rich old gentlemen in Paddington recreation ground where their father took them to play... and that's what inspired the story Lucy Brown and Mr Grimes. </p> <p>\"In his innocence, it didn't occur to Pa that it wasn't a very good example for little girls, and the story had to be somewhat modified. </p> <p>\"Luckily, though, no one objected to the hair-raising situations from which Little Tim makes such heroic escapes - and it's the same benevolent Mr Grimes who so obligingly forks out for the steam yacht Evangeline, in which Tim and Lucy Go To Sea. Reading these stories with my sons was, for me, one of the major delights of parenthood - and the creation of them was clearly very important to Ardizzone. </p> <p>\"He talked about them a lot,\" says Christianna, \"about the simple text, the structure, and the importance of a turning point in the narrative.\" And although the line and wash drawings, with that vigorous, distinctive hatching and cross-hatching seem so spontaneous, \"he'd draw and redraw until he got it exactly right\".

      "bodyText": "\"He drew constantly - always carried a sketchbook, usually a publisher's 'dummy' - but, failing that, he drew on envelopes or the backs of cigarette boxes. Even his letters had drawings all over - I grew up thinking all correspondence was illustrated: when I went away to school I was surprised by the dull letters all the other girls received. Pa was always drawing. We just took it for granted - it was what he did.\" Christianna Clemence is talking about her father, Edward Ardizzone. His self-portrait hangs on the wall behind her and bears quite a resemblance to her young grandson, Tom, who's visiting, and who waits patiently as we talk. Edward Ardizzone (1900-1979) was one of the best-known, best-loved and most influential and important of all 20th century illustrators. Astonishingly prolific, his work includes watercolours, oils, prints, magazine illustrations including those for the Radio Times (which, in its heyday, was a marvellous showcase for illustrators) and, on a larger scale, the famous lithographs for the old J Lyons teashops, posters and even murals for an ocean liner. And, of course, he was a distinguished war artist. He illustrated more than 180 books - from Shakespeare, Dickens, Galsworthy to Walter de la Mare, Eleanor Farjeon and a delightful autobiography - and is perhaps best known for his Little Tim books, which grew from the stories he told Christianna and her brother as children. They lived in London and Christianna - now 70 and a hugely entertaining storyteller herself - paints a vivid picture of the family home in Maida Vale, whose streets, shops, pubs, parks and raffish local characters are recorded with such affectionate relish in Ardizzone's work. Ardizzone worked at home; he had been a clerk in his father's firm, forever embellishing the accounts with drawings and doodles, and attending life classes at Westminster School of Art in the evenings, but he gave up that job to become a professional artist. \"He started with book jackets,\" says Christianna, \"but money was scarce, so Ma, who was very beautiful and very tall, got a job as a fashion model and Pa looked after us at home while he worked. The house smelled deliciously of turpentine, and he sat at his desk up on a model's throne, on the first floor. With no garden, and a very dark nursery, my brother and I just larked around the studio; mostly he ignored our squabbles and screams, but he'd attend to the odd splinter, and now and again he'd say 'please don't lean out of the window!' or 'please don't climb on the roof'.\" And did you obey? \"Of course not - we couldn't hear him, anyway, if we were out on the roof. But it was perfectly safe - one of those huge Victorian houses where behind the parapet you could get access to all the different levels,\" she says briskly (and for a moment I wonder where her grandson has got to). And did he prepare your meals? \"Oh, yes, he was a much better cook than our mother! Usually it was semolina and pineapple chunks... and he'd take us out to the park to play, and sometimes I walked down to the framers with him when he had exhibitions at the Leger Gallery. He read to us a lot at bedtime, but we'd always end up asking for \"real stories\" - ie, the ones he made up himself, and he'd say: 'Well, now ... let's see ... how does it go?' \" So with these exemplary \"parenting skills\" was he an early version of \"new man\"? \"Absolutely not! Very old-fashioned in his ideas about women... no question of girls going to university - you just had to hope to get married!\" And, indeed, Christianna, as a little girl, had elaborate plans to secure a comfortable future by making friends with rich old gentlemen in Paddington recreation ground where their father took them to play... and that's what inspired the story Lucy Brown and Mr Grimes. \"In his innocence, it didn't occur to Pa that it wasn't a very good example for little girls, and the story had to be somewhat modified. \"Luckily, though, no one objected to the hair-raising situations from which Little Tim makes such heroic escapes - and it's the same benevolent Mr Grimes who so obligingly forks out for the steam yacht Evangeline, in which Tim and Lucy Go To Sea. Reading these stories with my sons was, for me, one of the major delights of parenthood - and the creation of them was clearly very important to Ardizzone. \"He talked about them a lot,\" says Christianna, \"about the simple text, the structure, and the importance of a turning point in the narrative.\" And although the line and wash drawings, with that vigorous, distinctive hatching and cross-hatching seem so spontaneous, \"he'd draw and redraw until he got it exactly right\". Lucy and Tim were based on Christianna and her brother, so did they have to sit still to be drawn? \"Oh, no! He didn't draw from life except in formal life classes: he did all his drawing from memory, drawing what he'd seen half-an-hour before. And I have a theory that the speed and fluency of his drawing was partly due to the fact that he had a bit of a stammer - drawing was a much easier form of communication.\" And it's that ease of visual communication that allows the pictures to tell so much of the story.

And anyway, as Christianna points out, her father didn't make much distinction between work for children and work for adults - \"he always treated us as equals - he would certainly never talk down or draw down to children.\" As with Tim and Lucy, whatever happened he simply expected them to rise to the occasion. Calling to mind Hogarth, Rowlandson, Cruickshank and Daumier, Ardizzone's style has its roots firmly in the traditions of the 18th and 19th centuries; his work spans the greater part of the 20th century; and now, ensuring its accessibility in the new millennium, Scholastic is re-publishing all the Little Tim stories. In order to create fresh, bright books rather than fusty facsimiles, they've used the latest technology to scan Ardizzone's original colour washes, with the black lines on a separate overlay.

      "body": "<p>Headteacher Ian Lane leads the way out through the Victorian red-brick portals of the handsomely restored Anderton Park School towards a cluster of huts which, he points out, \"were due for demolition in 1949\". Half a century on, and they're still being put to good use. Through the windows of one we can see year 6 pupils bent over their books. Another houses a computer course, another an A-level Urdu class and yet another a degree course.</p> <p>Yes, this is a primary school and no, the ones studying for their degrees are not astonishingly precocious 11-year-olds. They are mothers or older sisters, for the most part, of pupils from Anderton Park or from any one of 25 schools here in Sparkhill or adjoining areas of inner-city Birmingham. Eight years ago, the schools came together to offer adults in the community the chance to study in close proximity to their children. In effect, they are all women who, for one reason or another, have not been able to fulfil their potential in further or higher education. \"It would be unusual in an area like this for men and women to attend the same courses,\" says Lane.</p> <p>And it is the women who have been particularly disadvantaged by cultural pressures. It could be that they have been expected to leave the sixth-form before completing A-levels. That was the case with Jusna Begum, 25, who came to Birmingham from Bradford for an arranged marriage. She now has two children, aged five and 16 months, so she appreciates the cr\u008fche facilities. \"It was hard to get back into education at first,\" she says. \"As it's gone on, though, I've found it easier. And my husband has been supportive.\"</p> <p>Tahira Hussein, 21, has no husband or children. But she does have strict parents who wouldn't allow her to go away to university or even to travel across Birmingham to study (a restriction that doesn't apply to her younger brother). \"I've already done a BTec in computers,\" she says, \"and when the chance to take a degree came up I said to myself, 'right, I'm going to do this.' I'm very committed. I might go into teaching.\" </p> <p>The opportunity exists for anyone who completes the three-year course for a BA in Early Childhood Studies to go on to study for a Post Graduate Certificate of Education. Ian Lane could be forgiven for hoping that as many as possible of the 23 women who are just starting their second term will do just that. After all, Anderton Park has a problem that is not immediately evident. </p> <p>On the face of it, the school has been transformed during Lane's 10-year reign. It's difficult to believe that the building itself was condemned as \"dirty and smelly\" by government inspectors in 1984. Since then, money has been forthcoming from the European Union, central government and the local education authority in Birmingham. Anderton Park was recently granted a charter mark by an assessor who proclaimed himself impressed by the discipline of the children and the dedication of the staff. So what's the problem? </p> <p>Language. All but two mixed-race children among the 650 pupils come from homes where English is second to Punjabi in day-to-day conversation. Yet only three of the 23 teachers are Punjabi speakers. Since he was given control over his own budget, Lane has recruited 13 teaching assistants from the local community. Nine of them work in key stage 1, where 73% are at level 2 or above in reading - around the national average. By key stage 2, results are not so good. Just 55% of those leaving last summer achieved level 4. \"The big problem is that our kids don't experience English at a higher level because their parents don't speak it at home,\" says Lane. \"Their knowledge of common nouns and verbs is stuck at the level of nine-year-olds.\" Hence the need for more qualified bilingual teachers. \"Local people should be part of the solution, so we're welcoming the talent that's already here,\" says community education development officer Peter Simpson. \"There's too much of the cavalry riding in from outside.\" He shows the way into a small library.

      "bodyText": "Headteacher Ian Lane leads the way out through the Victorian red-brick portals of the handsomely restored Anderton Park School towards a cluster of huts which, he points out, \"were due for demolition in 1949\". Half a century on, and they're still being put to good use. Through the windows of one we can see year 6 pupils bent over their books. Another houses a computer course, another an A-level Urdu class and yet another a degree course. Yes, this is a primary school and no, the ones studying for their degrees are not astonishingly precocious 11-year-olds. They are mothers or older sisters, for the most part, of pupils from Anderton Park or from any one of 25 schools here in Sparkhill or adjoining areas of inner-city Birmingham. Eight years ago, the schools came together to offer adults in the community the chance to study in close proximity to their children. In effect, they are all women who, for one reason or another, have not been able to fulfil their potential in further or higher education. \"It would be unusual in an area like this for men and women to attend the same courses,\" says Lane. And it is the women who have been particularly disadvantaged by cultural pressures. It could be that they have been expected to leave the sixth-form before completing A-levels. That was the case with Jusna Begum, 25, who came to Birmingham from Bradford for an arranged marriage. She now has two children, aged five and 16 months, so she appreciates the cr\u008fche facilities. \"It was hard to get back into education at first,\" she says. \"As it's gone on, though, I've found it easier. And my husband has been supportive.\" Tahira Hussein, 21, has no husband or children. But she does have strict parents who wouldn't allow her to go away to university or even to travel across Birmingham to study (a restriction that doesn't apply to her younger brother). \"I've already done a BTec in computers,\" she says, \"and when the chance to take a degree came up I said to myself, 'right, I'm going to do this.' I'm very committed. I might go into teaching.\" The opportunity exists for anyone who completes the three-year course for a BA in Early Childhood Studies to go on to study for a Post Graduate Certificate of Education. Ian Lane could be forgiven for hoping that as many as possible of the 23 women who are just starting their second term will do just that. After all, Anderton Park has a problem that is not immediately evident. On the face of it, the school has been transformed during Lane's 10-year reign. It's difficult to believe that the building itself was condemned as \"dirty and smelly\" by government inspectors in 1984. Since then, money has been forthcoming from the European Union, central government and the local education authority in Birmingham. Anderton Park was recently granted a charter mark by an assessor who proclaimed himself impressed by the discipline of the children and the dedication of the staff. So what's the problem? Language. All but two mixed-race children among the 650 pupils come from homes where English is second to Punjabi in day-to-day conversation. Yet only three of the 23 teachers are Punjabi speakers. Since he was given control over his own budget, Lane has recruited 13 teaching assistants from the local community. Nine of them work in key stage 1, where 73% are at level 2 or above in reading - around the national average. By key stage 2, results are not so good. Just 55% of those leaving last summer achieved level 4. \"The big problem is that our kids don't experience English at a higher level because their parents don't speak it at home,\" says Lane. \"Their knowledge of common nouns and verbs is stuck at the level of nine-year-olds.\" Hence the need for more qualified bilingual teachers. \"Local people should be part of the solution, so we're welcoming the talent that's already here,\" says community education development officer Peter Simpson. \"There's too much of the cavalry riding in from outside.\" He shows the way into a small library. Expenditure on degree-level books is due to rise from \u00a3400 to \u00a31,000. Internet access should also increase this term, from one terminal to 16. Back in the hut, the degree-course women are finishing their break and preparing for the next session. The majority are Muslim. Nearly all are in traditional dress and two peer out through the slits in black \"hijab\" head-dresses. \"When I taught here, 21 years ago, you didn't see many mothers at all,\" says the course co-ordinator, Julie Boardman from South Birmingham College. \"They were in purdah.

Having been there at the moment for which it was built, I still think it's an emblem not of British brilliance - `the greatest show on earth,'' Mr Blair ventured - but of a desperate, empty, national grandiosity from which, because its origins were locked in political bipartisanship, there's been no escape.</p> <p>Why did they do it?

Now that the whole thing is done, it's obligatory to emphasise the positive, which everyone with a stake in its creation, from Michael Grade to BSkyB, has been frantically trying to do. At \u00a3750m, there certainly should be something positive, amid the vast political pretension.</p> <p>But pretension dominates. The politicians' every word reeks of it. The place is meant to be far, far more than fun. 'We set out to create the biggest statement of confidence in Britain,' Michael Heseltine intoned, 'and we have done that tonight. We have created something magnificent... a success that billions of people round the world would have seen.' Blair called it 'a triumph of confidence over cynicism, boldness over blandness, excellence over mediocrity', questioning the patriotism of anyone who said otherwise. I don't know whether I find the absurdity or the menace of such common language the more repellent.</p> <p>Yet sentiments like this were inevitable, as soon as politicians had agreed to make the monster Dome a public project. What first mattered to them, once they were committed to the huge exercise in architectural solipsism, was its completion.</p> <p>Everything else was cast aside, beginning with even elementary care over arrangements to get there on the night. The politicians' panic concerned the possibility that the thing might not be finished, no matter who could or couldn't see it in time, after a night trapped for hours in railway queues. To Mr Heseltine, 'a few people being late' was a matter of insulting triviality.</p> <p>As the passion that counted, completion also surpassed any serious concern for what, exactly, was being completed. From the start unable to describe the message of the Dome, except as a piece of national boosterism, the public men who insisted on it being built were no closer to its deeper meaning by the end - as anyone who goes there will quickly find. The unifying theme is sponsor-domination. There are some arresting exhibits, but these seem, in the scale of things, utterly beside both the political and financial point.</p> <p>The scale required something which, within an idiom of pure display, untouched by artistic or any other coherence, was unattainable under the rules laid down by McDonald's and British Airways.</p> <p>What seems important now is to try and forget about the Dome, and behave, as a public nation, as though the millennium itself is already evolving into just another year. This will be hard to do, because of the excesses of grandiloquence the politicians have indulged in. But amnesia is, actually, the way to rescue New Labour from its own folly: the impulse that compelled it, first, to semi-pledge, when Heseltine demanded it, continuity for the project, and then, after the 1997 landslide, to recoil from cancelling what many members of the cabinet knew to be pointless waste of immense resources - and thus sustain a project better fitted to the bellowing emptiness of a government on the verge of collapse than one freshly mandated to get to grips with reality.</p> <p>For that is the irony of the Dome. Far from glorifying New Labour, it distracts from what the government is doing. Forced to up his rhetoric to heights of overheated vacuity, Mr Blair does his real project less than justice. This project is more solid than the Dome will ever be. Ersatz millennial permanence is precisely what new Britain did not need: Heseltine's poisoned pill, swallowed by successors who would do better to forget than celebrate their old naivety.</p>",

The politicians' panic concerned the possibility that the thing might not be finished, no matter who could or couldn't see it in time, after a night trapped for hours in railway queues. To Mr Heseltine, 'a few people being late' was a matter of insulting triviality. As the passion that counted, completion also surpassed any serious concern for what, exactly, was being completed. From the start unable to describe the message of the Dome, except as a piece of national boosterism, the public men who insisted on it being built were no closer to its deeper meaning by the end - as anyone who goes there will quickly find. The unifying theme is sponsor-domination. There are some arresting exhibits, but these seem, in the scale of things, utterly beside both the political and financial point. The scale required something which, within an idiom of pure display, untouched by artistic or any other coherence, was unattainable under the rules laid down by McDonald's and British Airways. What seems important now is to try and forget about the Dome, and behave, as a public nation, as though the millennium itself is already evolving into just another year. This will be hard to do, because of the excesses of grandiloquence the politicians have indulged in. But amnesia is, actually, the way to rescue New Labour from its own folly: the impulse that compelled it, first, to semi-pledge, when Heseltine demanded it, continuity for the project, and then, after the 1997 landslide, to recoil from cancelling what many members of the cabinet knew to be pointless waste of immense resources - and thus sustain a project better fitted to the bellowing emptiness of a government on the verge of collapse than one freshly mandated to get to grips with reality. For that is the irony of the Dome. Far from glorifying New Labour, it distracts from what the government is doing. Forced to up his rhetoric to heights of overheated vacuity, Mr Blair does his real project less than justice. This project is more solid than the Dome will ever be. Ersatz millennial permanence is precisely what new Britain did not need: Heseltine's poisoned pill, swallowed by successors who would do better to forget than celebrate their old naivety.",

Army and police forces stormed a building in Beirut's Mazraa district from where the gunman had fired at the embassy. A woman hostage was later released unharmed. One policeman was killed and two wounded in a shootout with the gunman. At least two passers-by were hurt trying to flee the area. State television identified the gunman as a Palestinian named Ahmed Abou Kharoub and said a note was found in his pocket which read: 'I martyred myself for Grozny [the Chechen capital].' 'He [the gunman] said that he wanted to die a martyr and that it pained him not to have killed a Russian before he was shot,' the released hostage, a woman named Ina'am, said before being taken to a nearby police station. Police later said Abou Kharoub was aged 30 and lived in the Palestinian refugee camp of Ain el Hilweh, near the southern port of Sidon. He was the father of four children and owned an electronics and computer hardware shop. Relatives described him as a zealot with an extremist view of Islam and a lot of sympathy for the Chechen rebels. 'He would always say we must take revenge for the people in Grozny,' said a family member who refused to be identified. Officers said they believed Abou Kharoub had acted alone but soldiers were combing the area for possible accomplices. Security sources said the army found rocket-propelled grenade launchers and Kalashnikov rifles in the stormed building and were patrolling the area with armoured vehicles. A Russian diplomat at the embassy, Andrei Avdeev, said there were no Russian casualties in the assault and that only the consular section was damaged. The Mazraa area is in the Muslim sector of Beirut, where extremists have been sympa thetic with fellow Muslims in Chechnya who are fighting an onslaught by Russian forces. Russian troops launched a military offensive in September to wrest control of the rebel republic of Chechnya after Chechen-based militants invaded a neighbouring region and were blamed for a string of apartment bombings in Russia. Lebanese Muslim militants opposed to Russia's military campaign have staged protests against Moscow and some Beirut newspapers said last week that Islamists loyal to the Chechen rebels were being trained in Lebanon. Security officials denied the report. Lebanese President Emile Lahoud discussed yesterday's embassy attack with the prime minister, Selim al-Hoss. 'The incident involving the Russian embassy is now under control and our forces managed to quell it in about an hour,' the president's office said in a statement.",

      "body": "<p>Leaks rarely occur by accident. The one which emerged on BBC radio yesterday, revealing the dissatisfaction and, in some senses, near-despair of two senior officers with the difficulties they had to contend with in Kosovo, looks less accidental than most. But the overall message is clear and directed at politicians: you give us these dirty and difficult jobs to do, but you stint the resources needed to do them properly.</p> <p>The list of complaints is formidable. Such a shortage of guns that they had to borrow from others. Radios which could not be used either because they were broken or because the Serbs listened in. A shortage of night vision equipment. Troops forced to buy camp beds and other apparent necessities because they were not supplied. Lines of command confused, fractured or over-stretched. Legal constraints and confusions making it near impossible to do the policing job the world supposed they were sent there to do.

The one which emerged on BBC radio yesterday, revealing the dissatisfaction and, in some senses, near-despair of two senior officers with the difficulties they had to contend with in Kosovo, looks less accidental than most. But the overall message is clear and directed at politicians: you give us these dirty and difficult jobs to do, but you stint the resources needed to do them properly. The list of complaints is formidable. Such a shortage of guns that they had to borrow from others. Radios which could not be used either because they were broken or because the Serbs listened in. A shortage of night vision equipment. Troops forced to buy camp beds and other apparent necessities because they were not supplied. Lines of command confused, fractured or over-stretched. Legal constraints and confusions making it near impossible to do the policing job the world supposed they were sent there to do. And most chilling of all, the conclusion that had the circumstances when they went in been less 'benign' - had President Milosevic not wound down, leaving no real resistance to their advance - the enterprise might have ended in failure. All that underlines the unwisdom, of which we complained at the time, of launching the bombing without any firm plans for ground action. These complaints are addressed to Labour, since it was a Labour government which sent the 1st Battalion of the Parachute Regiment into Kosovo with lavish assurances that they had the total full-hearted support of everyone back at home. But they also apply to Conservative ministers under whom the steady reduction of defence spending began - in the belief, which has proved to be sadly misplaced, that the end of the cold war presaged a period of general peace.

The Ministry of Defence, which pointed out that the Nato operation to expel Slobodan Milosevic's forces from Kosovo was a resounding success, said that the reports were meant to be critical. 'We always, after a campaign such as Kosovo, review the events as soon as possible and as critically as possible,' an MOD spokesman said.

Six seats are available: select a woman, goes the logic, and you are almost certain to deliver another woman to Parliament. Welsh Labour women's bid to beat the old boys' network is spearheaded by Julie Morgan MP, in tandem with the Labour Women's Network. They have already held one training day in Cardiff and two more are planned. Local women are putting themselves forward, often for up to three seats, even if they do not believe they have a chance of winning.

Rapid feminisation coexists with deep-seated traditional attitudes. 'It's an awful thing to admit,' Anita Gayle says, 'but party members will accept women only with a degree of compulsion.' As Val Feld points out: 'You don't change patterns of behaviour and values overnight. There are positive signals in Wales, but it is still early days.' She favours renewed commitment to positive action at national level, but while constituency parties still have an obligation to produce 50:50 shortlists, experience suggests equality of opportunity does not result in equality of outcome. Three of the four Welsh women MPs currently in Westminster were selected through all-women shortlists and they are in marginal seats.</p> <p>'The current system is flawed,' Julie Morgan says. 'There is a danger we will not capitalise on the gains of the Welsh Assembly and could end up with fewer female politicians in Wales after the next general election.'</p> <p>The selections come at an important moment in Welsh political history and Wrexham, which kicks off the process, will be an important test of the party's feminisation. 'If women don't score well there,' Morgan argues, 'we still have time to organise ourselves and to raise our profile.' This is not victim feminism and why should it be? In spite of the trouble and strife, 1999 was a good year for Welsh feminism and democracy, and equality campaigners are determined to consolidate on their victory. At her retirement party last year, Anita Gayle was handed a T-shirt with 'I'm a feminist' on the front, 'And a trollop' on the back. The joke went down well, but then Gayle and many other Welsh women could afford to laugh. Last year, they won through in ways unprecedented in Britain. Whether they will still be smiling after the next parliamentary selections remains to be seen.</p>",

Three of the four Welsh women MPs currently in Westminster were selected through all-women shortlists and they are in marginal seats. 'The current system is flawed,' Julie Morgan says. 'There is a danger we will not capitalise on the gains of the Welsh Assembly and could end up with fewer female politicians in Wales after the next general election.' The selections come at an important moment in Welsh political history and Wrexham, which kicks off the process, will be an important test of the party's feminisation. 'If women don't score well there,' Morgan argues, 'we still have time to organise ourselves and to raise our profile.' This is not victim feminism and why should it be? In spite of the trouble and strife, 1999 was a good year for Welsh feminism and democracy, and equality campaigners are determined to consolidate on their victory. At her retirement party last year, Anita Gayle was handed a T-shirt with 'I'm a feminist' on the front, 'And a trollop' on the back. The joke went down well, but then Gayle and many other Welsh women could afford to laugh. Last year, they won through in ways unprecedented in Britain. Whether they will still be smiling after the next parliamentary selections remains to be seen.",

      "body": "<p>From the Eastons' home, some things look and feel like the English countryside: rolling, green hills; the damp smell of a recent rain; muddy wellingtons; stables with names such as 'Rosie' and 'Alice' on the gates; and the sound of soft-spoken English.</p> <p>Anne Easton grew up in Kent. James Easton's family left London for Essex when he was 14. They knew they did not want to raise a family in a town.</p> <p>So it was not surprising that, five years after moving to Israel in 1972, they left their flat in Jerusalem for the Golan Heights, then viewed as a gorgeously pristine backwater that needed to be settled to enhance the security of the Jewish state. The Israeli Labour party was then sending many young activists there, telling them they were pioneers doing their national duty.</p> <p>But the main attractions for the Eastons were the lush landscape and the prospect of a house with a decent garden. Six children and 15 horses later, they feel at home in this community of some 50 families on the southern tip of the Golan Heights - the crux of the dispute which Israeli and Syrian negotiators once again began trying to settle yesterday in Washington.</p> <p>All here know that the resumption of those talks, defunct for the past four years, was made possible only by the expression of willingness by the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, to withdraw from most or all of the Golan, which Israel captured from Syria in 1967 in the six-day war. And that means that the Eastons, like most of the 17,000 Israelis who have settled on the Golan Heights, would have to up sticks and start again elsewhere.</p> <p>It is a hard concept for the Eastons to swallow - and one they say they will fight as best they can.</p> <p>Though she trained as a pharmacologist, in 1981 Mrs Easton took advantage of the wide open spaces and started training horses. She opened a therapeutic riding school that caters for disabled people.</p> <p>'I grew up around horses in England, where it's part of the culture - kind of a religion,' says Mrs Easton, as she leads the last of the trotters inside for the afternoon. But the majestic view from the stables is a reminder that this a world away from the British Isles. Soaring mountains that are a patchwork of green forests, sandy dunes, and the snowcapped Mt Hermon present a topographical masterpiece that seems to combine the peaks of Europe with the deserts of Arabia. Up ahead are Syria and Lebanon. Below, to the west, is the sea of Galilee, sparkling like a sapphire on a sunny winter afternoon.</p> <p>That is where Mr Easton spends his days, surveying the quality of fish life in the sea of Galilee at the Israel Oceanographic and Limnological Research Company. Since the study of lakes is his speciality - he is studying for a PhD in fish ecology - the quality of water in the Bible's famous lake that Israelis call the Kinneret is one of his biggest concerns about making a peace deal with Syria.</p> <p>'I can see the Syrians building large pumping stations or taking water from the [river] Jordan after a peace agreement is reached, and no one will be able to stop them,' says Mr Easton. 'That could very seriously affect our water, and about 40% of the nation's supply is from the Kinneret. In an area where water is of major strategic value, it should be that they have absolutely no access to the Kinneret or the Jordan in the peace agreement.</p> <p>'The problem is he [Mr Barak] has already given the Golan away.'</p> <p>Not exactly. Even if Mr Barak signs a peace deal with the Syrian president, Hafez al-Assad, for the return of the Golan, he will have to get the approval of the majority of Israelis before he fulfils his side of the agreement. As a candidate, Mr Barak had volunteered that he would present the peace deal over the Golan to Israelis in a referendum.</p> <p>But more hawkish politicians beat him to it. By law, any Israeli leader who wants to relinquish a part of Israel proper - including the Golan, which was officially annexed to Israel in 1981 - must bring the question to Israeli voters first.</p> <p>Mr Barak has already begun assigning key officials in the Labour party to run a campaign to persuade the public of the wisdom of giving up the Golan in return for peace with Syria</p> <p>and therefore with neighbouring Lebanon, where Israel has been embroiled in a war of attrition with guerrilla groups such as Hizbullah for more than 15 years. This year promises a battle for the hearts and minds of Israelis - many of whom, like the Eastons, say they want peace but want to keep the land they have come to call their own.</p> <p>'I do think peace is important, but I don't think it's more important than anything else,' says Mrs Easton, offering mint tea and biscuits in a kitchen dotted with blue china cups that make a visitor feel closer to Staffordshire than Syria.</p> <p>'It seems like all Syria is interested in is having the Golan back as a matter of respect. It's such a big sacrifice to make,' she adds. 'My parents are aghast. 'Give up your home?' You don't do that - certainly not in England.'</p> <p>And yet, they and others here know that it will be hard to argue against a chance to end Israel's unpopular war in Lebanon, which has touched their lives as much as anyone else's. In recent years, they have been to several funerals of young soldiers from the community who have died in the fighting. Two of their children have been through the army, while two more are approaching the age of mandatory service.</p> <p>And for their youngest, a 12-year-old son, the concerns are of any schoolboy: fears of losing friends when they have to move to a new place; a new school. But those are particulars that no one here wants to talk about. The Eastons say they cannot even think about where they would move if they are forced to leave, and are not interested in the national debate over compensation for lost homes.</p> <p>'I don't know how you can compensate people for 25 years of living here,' says Mrs Easton. 'People have planted orchards. There is a real attachment to the land, and it's a tough life being a farmer.' Around their agricultural settlement, residents are still planting new mangos.</p> <p>But such acts of denial of the political situation clash with what Mrs Easton says is an air of defeat. 'I must confess that there's a feeling of pessimism there that the race has been run,' she says.</p> <p>However, the Golan Residents Committee has already launched a protest campaign to fight Mr Barak's plans.

      "bodyText": "From the Eastons' home, some things look and feel like the English countryside: rolling, green hills; the damp smell of a recent rain; muddy wellingtons; stables with names such as 'Rosie' and 'Alice' on the gates; and the sound of soft-spoken English. Anne Easton grew up in Kent. James Easton's family left London for Essex when he was 14. They knew they did not want to raise a family in a town. So it was not surprising that, five years after moving to Israel in 1972, they left their flat in Jerusalem for the Golan Heights, then viewed as a gorgeously pristine backwater that needed to be settled to enhance the security of the Jewish state. The Israeli Labour party was then sending many young activists there, telling them they were pioneers doing their national duty. But the main attractions for the Eastons were the lush landscape and the prospect of a house with a decent garden. Six children and 15 horses later, they feel at home in this community of some 50 families on the southern tip of the Golan Heights - the crux of the dispute which Israeli and Syrian negotiators once again began trying to settle yesterday in Washington. All here know that the resumption of those talks, defunct for the past four years, was made possible only by the expression of willingness by the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, to withdraw from most or all of the Golan, which Israel captured from Syria in 1967 in the six-day war. And that means that the Eastons, like most of the 17,000 Israelis who have settled on the Golan Heights, would have to up sticks and start again elsewhere. It is a hard concept for the Eastons to swallow - and one they say they will fight as best they can. Though she trained as a pharmacologist, in 1981 Mrs Easton took advantage of the wide open spaces and started training horses. She opened a therapeutic riding school that caters for disabled people. 'I grew up around horses in England, where it's part of the culture - kind of a religion,' says Mrs Easton, as she leads the last of the trotters inside for the afternoon. But the majestic view from the stables is a reminder that this a world away from the British Isles. Soaring mountains that are a patchwork of green forests, sandy dunes, and the snowcapped Mt Hermon present a topographical masterpiece that seems to combine the peaks of Europe with the deserts of Arabia. Up ahead are Syria and Lebanon. Below, to the west, is the sea of Galilee, sparkling like a sapphire on a sunny winter afternoon. That is where Mr Easton spends his days, surveying the quality of fish life in the sea of Galilee at the Israel Oceanographic and Limnological Research Company. Since the study of lakes is his speciality - he is studying for a PhD in fish ecology - the quality of water in the Bible's famous lake that Israelis call the Kinneret is one of his biggest concerns about making a peace deal with Syria. 'I can see the Syrians building large pumping stations or taking water from the [river] Jordan after a peace agreement is reached, and no one will be able to stop them,' says Mr Easton. 'That could very seriously affect our water, and about 40% of the nation's supply is from the Kinneret. In an area where water is of major strategic value, it should be that they have absolutely no access to the Kinneret or the Jordan in the peace agreement. 'The problem is he [Mr Barak] has already given the Golan away.' Not exactly. Even if Mr Barak signs a peace deal with the Syrian president, Hafez al-Assad, for the return of the Golan, he will have to get the approval of the majority of Israelis before he fulfils his side of the agreement. As a candidate, Mr Barak had volunteered that he would present the peace deal over the Golan to Israelis in a referendum. But more hawkish politicians beat him to it. By law, any Israeli leader who wants to relinquish a part of Israel proper - including the Golan, which was officially annexed to Israel in 1981 - must bring the question to Israeli voters first. Mr Barak has already begun assigning key officials in the Labour party to run a campaign to persuade the public of the wisdom of giving up the Golan in return for peace with Syria and therefore with neighbouring Lebanon, where Israel has been embroiled in a war of attrition with guerrilla groups such as Hizbullah for more than 15 years. This year promises a battle for the hearts and minds of Israelis - many of whom, like the Eastons, say they want peace but want to keep the land they have come to call their own. 'I do think peace is important, but I don't think it's more important than anything else,' says Mrs Easton, offering mint tea and biscuits in a kitchen dotted with blue china cups that make a visitor feel closer to Staffordshire than Syria. 'It seems like all Syria is interested in is having the Golan back as a matter of respect. It's such a big sacrifice to make,' she adds. 'My parents are aghast. 'Give up your home?' You don't do that - certainly not in England.' And yet, they and others here know that it will be hard to argue against a chance to end Israel's unpopular war in Lebanon, which has touched their lives as much as anyone else's. In recent years, they have been to several funerals of young soldiers from the community who have died in the fighting. Two of their children have been through the army, while two more are approaching the age of mandatory service. And for their youngest, a 12-year-old son, the concerns are of any schoolboy: fears of losing friends when they have to move to a new place; a new school. But those are particulars that no one here wants to talk about. The Eastons say they cannot even think about where they would move if they are forced to leave, and are not interested in the national debate over compensation for lost homes. 'I don't know how you can compensate people for 25 years of living here,' says Mrs Easton. 'People have planted orchards. There is a real attachment to the land, and it's a tough life being a farmer.' Around their agricultural settlement, residents are still planting new mangos. But such acts of denial of the political situation clash with what Mrs Easton says is an air of defeat. 'I must confess that there's a feeling of pessimism there that the race has been run,' she says. However, the Golan Residents Committee has already launched a protest campaign to fight Mr Barak's plans. And some want to take it further than that. 'This used to be called the 'wild west' of Israel, because people chase around with horses and there are a lot of eccentric people here,' Mrs Easton says, 'and some people are ready to sit on the roof with a gun and refuse to leave.' But she and her husband believe most settlers here would not and should not resort to violence against their own soldiers. 'What I plan to do, in as civilised a way as possible, is to show people the importance of the Golan,' Mr Easton says. 'I think a lot of people here are like us. We'll put up as strong a fight as possible - but if the Israeli people decide we have to leave, then we'll go.'",

      "body": "<p>Brighton and Hove, until recently rival twins trading regular insults, emerged yesterday as the frontrunner in the race to become the first city of the new millennium. The newly unified borough, New Labour's model council on the south coast, is the 4-1 favourite out of 39 towns bidding for city status in a competition shrouded in mystery.</p> <p>No one is quite sure when the final decision will be made, still less the procedure used by the Queen, on the advice of the home secretary, to create Britain's 59th city.</p> <p>Lavish videos, websites, and endless stunts have formed part of the armoury of contestants, ranging from the comical to the magisterial. Harsh words have been spoken, verbal grenades thrown - particularly along the M4 between Reading (12-1) and Swindon (16-1) - as competitors enter the final straight.</p> <p>Brighton and Hove even used a relay team of cyclists to present its 'people's bid' - contained in a wooden box crafted by a local sculptor - to the home office.</p> <p>That failed to impress Milton Keynes (12-1) the country's fastest-growing town, which has long insisted on calling itself a city even without official status. 'I always think a town with 'and' in the middle of its name is trying to make itself bigger, and better than it actually is,' stormed Kevin Wilson, leader of Milton Keynes council.</p> <p>Since the home office announced that one town would be elevated to city status early in 2000, many contenders have taken comfort from the reluctance of most bookies to give any odds. 'It's far too imprecise,' said Ladbrokes. 'How on earth can you make a judgment?'.</p> <p>That did not stop William Hill gingerly entering the fray yesterday with a table of odds, although its spokesman, Graham Sharpe, admitted: 'It's a race without a course and with no form guide.' Nevertheless, punters had waged up to \u00a31,000. Some, Mr Sharpe suspected, were members of campaign teams attemping to bolster the standing of individual towns.</p> <p>Luton, which has been labelled a northern-style industrial town which somehow found itself in the south, surprisingly came second favourite with odds of 8-1. Bill McKenzie, its council leader, was not surprised. He believes Luton's charm lies in its ordinariness. 'Anyone who comes here can make their way in life. OK, it might not be leafy laned, south-east suburbia - a Virginia Water in Bedfordshire - but it has an honest, can-do attitude and is very representative of Britain today.'</p> <p>His only problem is that Milton Keynes, a few miles down the M1, is also challenging hard. With a 210,000 population, it has been identified by planners as a major growth point which could mean its population doubling to almost half a million in the first quarter of the next century.</p> <p>Kevin Wilson, its council leader, said the town that only became a borough in 1974 could soon have a population bigger than Liverpool (452,000 and falling fast). 'I can't think of a better way of celebrating the millennium than by giving a new town city status for the first time.'</p> <p>He has even enlisted the support of the jazz musician John Dankworth and his wife Cleo Laine, who live in a village on the outskirts of the town. Dankworth recently wrote that MK had matured from what seemed a 'disordered mass' into a sensitively planned metropolis 'with more than a few touches of brilliance'. Built on a grid system, with wide boulevards and few definining features apart from a newish ecumenical church, it certainly has detractors. Simon Fanshawe, the broadcaster and entertainer, would probably be one of them. He chairs a ''rainbow coalition'' pushing Brighton and Hove's bid. 'We've brought together a group of bright bunnies, not the great and the good, or the middle-aged and the worthy, but the active and the significant.'</p> <p>Brighton might have been a fading resort a few years ago, but it had become the natural capital of the south coast, attracting 'the talented, the quirky, the imaginative'.</p> <p>What about Hove, now part of the same local authority? 'Well, it was a bit of Rhodesia on the south coast, but now it's even got a Labour MP,' said Fanshawe, who graduated from Sussex university 25 years ago. But some would dispute his assertion that the 'two towns are naturally joined together'.</p> <p>Further north, along the booming M4 corridor, Reading and Swindon are proving that New Labour harmony has its limits. The two towns almost came to blows when Swindon was portrayed, in a national advertisement, as a pastoral idyll rather than an old railway town made good.</p> <p>Martin Salter, MP for Reading West, was forced to apologise to his Swindon counterparts when he told his local paper he had 'every sympathy for everyone who has to live in Swindon... the River Thames in Wiltshire is little more than a ditch.'</p> <p>In old Labour's north-east heartland, Middlesbrough could well be out of the running mainly because Sunderland, 20 miles north up the A19, was the last town to achieve city status in 1992. Colin Anderson, the council leader, said it had never looked back.</p> <p>'We've even created 13,000 extra jobs and some of that is undoubtedly due to the prestige of becoming a city,' he said.</p> <p><b>The battle of Britain's towns</b></p> <p><b>Brighton and Hove:</b> <br> Population: 249,000. <br> Landmark: Royal Pavilion, an oriental extravaganza; Palace Pier. <br> Famous people: Max Miller, comedian.

      "bodyText": "Brighton and Hove, until recently rival twins trading regular insults, emerged yesterday as the frontrunner in the race to become the first city of the new millennium. The newly unified borough, New Labour's model council on the south coast, is the 4-1 favourite out of 39 towns bidding for city status in a competition shrouded in mystery. No one is quite sure when the final decision will be made, still less the procedure used by the Queen, on the advice of the home secretary, to create Britain's 59th city. Lavish videos, websites, and endless stunts have formed part of the armoury of contestants, ranging from the comical to the magisterial. Harsh words have been spoken, verbal grenades thrown - particularly along the M4 between Reading (12-1) and Swindon (16-1) - as competitors enter the final straight. Brighton and Hove even used a relay team of cyclists to present its 'people's bid' - contained in a wooden box crafted by a local sculptor - to the home office. That failed to impress Milton Keynes (12-1) the country's fastest-growing town, which has long insisted on calling itself a city even without official status. 'I always think a town with 'and' in the middle of its name is trying to make itself bigger, and better than it actually is,' stormed Kevin Wilson, leader of Milton Keynes council. Since the home office announced that one town would be elevated to city status early in 2000, many contenders have taken comfort from the reluctance of most bookies to give any odds. 'It's far too imprecise,' said Ladbrokes. 'How on earth can you make a judgment?'. That did not stop William Hill gingerly entering the fray yesterday with a table of odds, although its spokesman, Graham Sharpe, admitted: 'It's a race without a course and with no form guide.' Nevertheless, punters had waged up to \u00a31,000. Some, Mr Sharpe suspected, were members of campaign teams attemping to bolster the standing of individual towns. Luton, which has been labelled a northern-style industrial town which somehow found itself in the south, surprisingly came second favourite with odds of 8-1. Bill McKenzie, its council leader, was not surprised. He believes Luton's charm lies in its ordinariness. 'Anyone who comes here can make their way in life. OK, it might not be leafy laned, south-east suburbia - a Virginia Water in Bedfordshire - but it has an honest, can-do attitude and is very representative of Britain today.' His only problem is that Milton Keynes, a few miles down the M1, is also challenging hard. With a 210,000 population, it has been identified by planners as a major growth point which could mean its population doubling to almost half a million in the first quarter of the next century. Kevin Wilson, its council leader, said the town that only became a borough in 1974 could soon have a population bigger than Liverpool (452,000 and falling fast). 'I can't think of a better way of celebrating the millennium than by giving a new town city status for the first time.' He has even enlisted the support of the jazz musician John Dankworth and his wife Cleo Laine, who live in a village on the outskirts of the town. Dankworth recently wrote that MK had matured from what seemed a 'disordered mass' into a sensitively planned metropolis 'with more than a few touches of brilliance'. Built on a grid system, with wide boulevards and few definining features apart from a newish ecumenical church, it certainly has detractors. Simon Fanshawe, the broadcaster and entertainer, would probably be one of them. He chairs a ''rainbow coalition'' pushing Brighton and Hove's bid. 'We've brought together a group of bright bunnies, not the great and the good, or the middle-aged and the worthy, but the active and the significant.' Brighton might have been a fading resort a few years ago, but it had become the natural capital of the south coast, attracting 'the talented, the quirky, the imaginative'. What about Hove, now part of the same local authority? 'Well, it was a bit of Rhodesia on the south coast, but now it's even got a Labour MP,' said Fanshawe, who graduated from Sussex university 25 years ago. But some would dispute his assertion that the 'two towns are naturally joined together'. Further north, along the booming M4 corridor, Reading and Swindon are proving that New Labour harmony has its limits. The two towns almost came to blows when Swindon was portrayed, in a national advertisement, as a pastoral idyll rather than an old railway town made good. Martin Salter, MP for Reading West, was forced to apologise to his Swindon counterparts when he told his local paper he had 'every sympathy for everyone who has to live in Swindon... the River Thames in Wiltshire is little more than a ditch.' In old Labour's north-east heartland, Middlesbrough could well be out of the running mainly because Sunderland, 20 miles north up the A19, was the last town to achieve city status in 1992. Colin Anderson, the council leader, said it had never looked back. 'We've even created 13,000 extra jobs and some of that is undoubtedly due to the prestige of becoming a city,' he said.

They had had a peaceful holiday in 400 caravans parked near the front, confounding residents' fears there would be trouble. Bogus milkman is suspect killer Police on Merseyside suspect that a bogus milkman may be the murderer of Marjorie Keating, 83, found battered to death at her home in Bootle on Sunday. Detectives said she apparently struggled with a burglar - possibly the same man, with tatoos on the fingers of his left hand, who last week had talked her into handing over \u00a313. Gales bring power cuts More than 10,000 homes in Orkney, Shetland, the Western Isles and the Highlands were temporalily without electricity yesterday when winds of more than 100 mph blew down power lines.

In that typically succinct formulation, he condensed the arc of a productive and many-sided life.<br> Born in Warsaw, educated in Weimar Berlin, he carried into the culture of Israel the questioning and cosmopolitan socialism which was one of the best legacies of the emancipation of the Jews in Europe. Whether running a challenging theatre or creating a succession of pioneering museums, his principled inventiveness kept everyone around him honest. Berlin sharpened his wit and shaped his politics; he was very proud of his father's library of first editions of Marx, Lassalle and a collected Heine.<br> In 1935, he and his family emigrated to Palestine. For 20 years he worked on left-wing kibbutzim. He fought in the Hagana against British rule, then in 1942 became a British army sergeant in the Jewish Brigade. He led his troops - many of whom had lost families in the death camps - from Italy across the Austrian border. With the help of British intelligence, accounts were settled with known Nazi killers. <br>Shaike's administrative and technical skills were first recognised in 1956 in the office of the Israeli prime minister, where he set up the country's first public computer. In 1961 he was asked by a group of talented actors to lead Tel Aviv's Cameri theatre, which they were forming as a modern alternative to the Habimah theatre.<br> For 16 years he ran the Cameri, in the stamp of Brecht's Berliner Ensemble and Jean Vilar's Th\u00e9atre National Populaire, creating a company to stage world classics and encourage new playwrights. One of them, Hanoch Levin, moved from dramas of playful fantasy to angry satire, as a giddy triumphalism succeeded the victories of the 1967 six-day war. Shaike supported Levin's work against political pressure from the Cameri board, which included Leah Rabin, wife of the future prime minister. <br>Shaike kept the Cameri honest. While running the theatre, he was asked to strike out in an entirely new direction. Nahum Goldmann, the independent-minded president of the World Jewish Congress, convinced Shaike that one of Israel's greatest needs was a dynamic history of the diaspora. The younger generation had short memories, and tended to see Jewish life before the creation of the state of Israel as negligible and incomplete.<br> With Goldmann's diplomatic and financial backing, Shaike devised a typically radical museum, Beth Hatefutsoth (The House of the Diaspora), on Tel Aviv university campus. Most historical museums, he argued, were built around the artefacts they happened to possess. But Shaike proposed to put historical narrative before objects, and reinvent objects where need be.<br> It was as though Disneyland techniques met serious historical research. Working with an inspired and often eccentric English designer, James Gardner, and artist-craftspeople across the world, Shaike and his team made not just a hugely instructive but an elating place. They used models, reconstructions (20 synagogues as they were before being burned down), dioramas, film-clips and interactive environments to lead the visitor on a firm narrative path. Informing through emotion and delight, the result kept its visitors honest about their dispersed ancestors.<br> It was the pre-eminence of this work in Tel Aviv that led Shaike, after capturing the history of Jerusalem in a museum tucked into the city's ancient walls, to Washington, and the creation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.<br> Moving in when the project had begun, but had not yet found its way, Shaike's dialectical mind saw that the only way forward was to embody the inevitable tensions of its subject. The museum should bring to life the historical narrative of an unequalled slaughter, but not become an exclusive memorial. And while being a metaphor for all genocide, it should plant its universality in the specifics of the holocaust. <br>Leading an international team of scholars, architects and designers, involving holocaust survivors in selecting exhibits, dealing with the personalities of private donors and the demands of the US government (for the museum had been granted a site near the Vietnam war memorial), Shaike deployed his accumulated talents. <br>At the heart of the holocaust museum - as it had been of his previous museums and his theatre - was the plot line. Embedded into the building, this became the `circulation path', a journey through history, exhibits, evidence, and documentary footage. Visitors were gripped into the plot's unfolding in real space, as tightly as they would be in a play. It was the plot, rooted in authoritative scholarship and realised in structured space, that squeezed the maximum meaning out of the artefacts of mass killing - an Auschwitz cattle-truck, through which you were obliged to walk, tiny white figures in a miniature crematorium, supported by a case of Zyklon-B canisters, a battered milk-churn from the Warsaw ghetto, in which a fighter had stuffed his diary, hoping that it would be read by future generations. Turning a corner, the visitor comes upon a heap of dead Jews' worn shoes, stinking under the display lights. <br>After the holocaust museum, Shaike became a museum developer in worldwide demand. From all his offers, he chose two which came full circle to reflect his roots: Warsaw's Museum of the Jews in Poland, and Berlin's Museum of the German Jews. <br>Going to Berlin each month, he found a hotel in the street where each day, as a child, he had walked to school. He was preparing the inaugural exhibition for Daniel Libeskind's splintered spaces, about the year 1848, when Jews gained civil emancipation in Germany, and uprisings across Europe heralded a century of struggle for freedom.<br>Shaike was rock-steady and impassioned, acerbic and tender, as compact and quick as a bird. In his life and his work, he made the fate of his people - like their attempted annihilation - inseparable from the fate of the world.<br> His wife Hanna died in 1992. <br>He is survived by a son and three daughters. <br><br>Jeshajahu 'Shaike' Weinberg, administrator and museum designer, born July 14 1918; died January 1 2000</p>",

With Goldmann's diplomatic and financial backing, Shaike devised a typically radical museum, Beth Hatefutsoth (The House of the Diaspora), on Tel Aviv university campus. Most historical museums, he argued, were built around the artefacts they happened to possess. But Shaike proposed to put historical narrative before objects, and reinvent objects where need be. It was as though Disneyland techniques met serious historical research. Working with an inspired and often eccentric English designer, James Gardner, and artist-craftspeople across the world, Shaike and his team made not just a hugely instructive but an elating place. They used models, reconstructions (20 synagogues as they were before being burned down), dioramas, film-clips and interactive environments to lead the visitor on a firm narrative path. Informing through emotion and delight, the result kept its visitors honest about their dispersed ancestors. It was the pre-eminence of this work in Tel Aviv that led Shaike, after capturing the history of Jerusalem in a museum tucked into the city's ancient walls, to Washington, and the creation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Moving in when the project had begun, but had not yet found its way, Shaike's dialectical mind saw that the only way forward was to embody the inevitable tensions of its subject. The museum should bring to life the historical narrative of an unequalled slaughter, but not become an exclusive memorial. And while being a metaphor for all genocide, it should plant its universality in the specifics of the holocaust. Leading an international team of scholars, architects and designers, involving holocaust survivors in selecting exhibits, dealing with the personalities of private donors and the demands of the US government (for the museum had been granted a site near the Vietnam war memorial), Shaike deployed his accumulated talents. At the heart of the holocaust museum - as it had been of his previous museums and his theatre - was the plot line. Embedded into the building, this became the `circulation path', a journey through history, exhibits, evidence, and documentary footage. Visitors were gripped into the plot's unfolding in real space, as tightly as they would be in a play. It was the plot, rooted in authoritative scholarship and realised in structured space, that squeezed the maximum meaning out of the artefacts of mass killing - an Auschwitz cattle-truck, through which you were obliged to walk, tiny white figures in a miniature crematorium, supported by a case of Zyklon-B canisters, a battered milk-churn from the Warsaw ghetto, in which a fighter had stuffed his diary, hoping that it would be read by future generations. Turning a corner, the visitor comes upon a heap of dead Jews' worn shoes, stinking under the display lights. After the holocaust museum, Shaike became a museum developer in worldwide demand. From all his offers, he chose two which came full circle to reflect his roots: Warsaw's Museum of the Jews in Poland, and Berlin's Museum of the German Jews. Going to Berlin each month, he found a hotel in the street where each day, as a child, he had walked to school. He was preparing the inaugural exhibition for Daniel Libeskind's splintered spaces, about the year 1848, when Jews gained civil emancipation in Germany, and uprisings across Europe heralded a century of struggle for freedom. Shaike was rock-steady and impassioned, acerbic and tender, as compact and quick as a bird. In his life and his work, he made the fate of his people - like their attempted annihilation - inseparable from the fate of the world. His wife Hanna died in 1992. He is survived by a son and three daughters. Jeshajahu 'Shaike' Weinberg, administrator and museum designer, born July 14 1918; died January 1 2000",

He looks more like a castaway than Oliver Reed ever did, even in the mundane surroundings of Gloucester station where we arrange to meet. But whether he will make entertaining, popular television is another matter - he's more Open University than Changing Rooms.</p> <p>Jowers and his wife Sheila are among a group of 36 men, women and children whom the BBC has shipped out to the deserted Scottish island of Taransay for a year to take part in Castaway 2000 - a television series which can be seen either as 'a unique, social experiment', as the BBC describes it, or the latest in a long line of fly-on-the-wall 'docusoaps' with a strong weather twist, depending on your point of view.</p> <p>Last week, while the rest of us were lying low, recovering from Christmas and making final plans for millennium celebrations, the fledgling islanders arrived at their new home, welcomed by winds of 140mph which blew off the roof of one of the sleeping quarters. Jowers, I imagine, leapt unthinkingly to the rescue, organising alternative arrangements and fixing the damage. After months of intensive interviews, tests and survival exercises, the TV production team thinks Jowers could become the father figure in the community, pivotal to its survival. After a couple of hours with him, I think they're probably right.</p> <p>Until last week, the Jowers lived an industrious, slightly alternative, Good Life existence in the Gloucestershire village of Westbury-on-Severn. Sheila, 51, quietly spoken and darkly pretty, worked as a teacher in art and design at the Royal Forest of Dean College; Peter, 52, was employed in the school of politics at the University of Western England, specialising in development, environmental policy, ecology and sustainable futures.</p> <p>They lived with three other families in Adsett Court, a beautiful 16-acre estate not far from the banks of the River Severn which they bought collectively in the 70s; they grew their own vegetables, kept chickens and converted their home from the outbuildings surrounding the gracious main house. Together they ran a local arts organisation and festival. Their three daughters, Mehalah, 23, Jessie, 21 and Henrietta, 19, had all left home to go to university, and they were beginning to consider starting a new adventure together.</p> <p>'I was thinking of buying a hill farm,' says Peter, who grew up on a smallholding on the Island of Mersea in Essex. 'I want to spend my last 25 years on a hill looking at sheep and planting hedges.'</p> <p>Then, last February, they noticed a small article about an opportunity to spend a year on a deserted Hebridean island. 'I thought, God that sounds wonderful,' says Sheila. They wrote a letter and barely gave it another thought, then in June she received a call inviting them to attend interviews at a Bristol hotel. There was psychological and psychometric testing, and a week of survival exercises in the Welsh mountains, orienteering, white water rafting and killing chickens for supper (not unlike the Jowers' family camping holidays, according to Peter). Then came confirmation that they were among those selected to take part in the experiment. They were delighted, but Peter was unsurprised.</p> <p>'I always felt we would. We had gone with a suck-it-and-see attitude,' says Peter, whose self-confidence could put a few noses out of joint on the island. 'Because of the life I've led there was nothing that seemed difficult at all. I enjoyed it very much. I think it gave us both a great deal of confidence. It made us realise we have some skills, that we could cope with different situations.'</p> <p>But what makes anyone want to give up a year of their lives to spend it with strangers on an overgrazed island without trees, abandoned by its own inhabitants 30 years ago? (Even the puffins have disappeared, killed by mink which escaped from neighbouring Harris.) 'What appealed to me was to be somewhere totally different and to be in touch with the elements,' says Sheila. 'Other people are amazed that anyone should want to go and spend time in a windswept wet place, but I love the idea of the changing light and the wind and the sky. To get to know it in depth, the darkness, no roads, no cars.</p> <p>'I was very excited and pleased [to be chosen], but that night I suddenly had doubts. How can I really walk out for a year - from my family, from the children?' Each member of the community is allowed only two visitors on one weekend for the whole year; there are no telephones, no email - only letters every two weeks and a VHF radio for emergencies. The next morning she told Henrietta, their youngest, she had decided she couldn't do it. Her daughters persuaded her to go but she's still worried that her eldest girl, who has fallen in love, will get married while she's away. 'We've forbidden them to do anything drastic.'</p> <p>Peter's key worry is how the group will get on. There's already been tension and disagreement between them - and that's before they even set foot on Scottish soil. (Jowers, it turns out, intervened and managed with some skill to resolve the dispute.) 'My experience of 36 people is that we will have to resolve some conflicts. There's bound to be romance (there are seven single men and seven single women among the group), but I think it will be problematical. It will be very intense. Anything could happen on that front.'</p> <p>The Jowers have other reservations too - they don't mind killing chickens, digging compost toilets and withstanding 140mph winds, but they are concerned how it will all be interpreted in a television series. They don't watch TV themselves, but having applied to take part in the project, they made a point of watching an episode of Paddington Green, which is made by the same production company, Lion Television.</p> <p>'The first question we asked was, 'Are we just puppets on the editing floor?'' says Peter. The producers managed to reassure them - but no matter how worthy the production company's intentions, it seems obvious that a good bust-up, a nervous breakdown or an illicit relationship make 'better telly' than a harmonious, successful sociological experiment.</p> <p>Executive producer Jeremy Mills rejects any suggestion that the project is little more than a bigger and better docusoap in the tradition of Hotel, Paddington Green, Airport and Children's Hospital, all of which he has been involved with. 'What is a docusoap? It has become a pejorative term to encompass a whole range of documentaries,' he says. 'The only common thing is you take a number of people and you follow their stories over a number of weeks.

The first four films, Mills says, bear no resemblance to a docusoap - they cover the selection process showing viewers how and why the panel of experts, including the likes of Lucy Irvine, herself a former castaway, former SAS survival expert Lofty Wiseman and psychologist Cynthia McVey, chose those taking part in the project. (Importantly, although the television producers were allowed a vote on who would go and who wouldn't, it was ultimately the experts' decision.)</p> <p>But what about the larger-than-life characters that usually steal the show? Who's going to be Taransay's answer to Maureen from Driving School? 'The one thing we did say in this whole thing was that we would not go for extremes,' says Mills. 'It would be very easy and cheap quick-fix entertainment to have a couple of larger than life figures but we didn't want to do that. These days you can turn up in a street, shout 'we want someone to be filmed' and you will get people coming out of their doors to take part. But they are usually the wrong people.

      "body": "<p>New century, new challenge. Trek through the Amazon rainforest, go white-water rafting on the Zambezi - or is horse-riding in Mongolia more your thing? Or perhaps an encounter with the 'real' Cuba the lazy tourists never see - on a bike?</p> <p>No wonder offbeat 'challenges', arduous and expensive though they are, have claimed the smart holiday slot. They offer a unique feel-good factor: apart from a registration fee of around \u00a3200, they're free - if you can persuade friends and colleagues to sign up for a sponsorship package of at least \u00a32,500. Two thirds of this goes to charity; the rest pays for your trip. With your new year resolution to adopt a less indulgent lifestyle wavering in the face of the January sales, there's never been a cannier moment for charities to pitch their fundraising holidays.</p> <p>Numbed by winter desolation, thousands of us will be sending off for brochures, offering adventures which cunningly mix altruism with exoticism. Packed with jazzy photos, cool prose and 24-hour enquiry hotlines, these brochures are as seductive as those of the big tour operators - except that the word 'holiday' is taboo.</p> <p>Though the number of trips is limited, exclusive destinations are added every year: the Inca trail in Peru has to be next summer's plum choice. Your friends and workmates will be anything but bored with your anecdotes and snaps - and impressed that you've raised at least \u00a31,500 for one of the 40 or so charities that run sponsored events.</p> <p>Indeed, the brochures are almost too successful: it's the lure of faraway places, the chance of moving through picturesque landscapes, meeting remote tribes and seeing ecological rarities that attracts customers. 'I don't think people who do this sort of thing are driven by a particular cause. The charity is secondary to the challenge,' says John Scourse of Guide Dogs for the Blind.</p> <p>Even so, in the post-trip euphoria, only a curmudgeonly colleague would dare to mutter that while you have indeed raised an impressive amount for a good cause, you've managed to get a 10-day freebie out of it - funded by sponsors who might not have been so generous had they realised this was part of the deal.</p> <p>Challenge holidays were the charity world's big idea of the 90s, and chimed brilliantly with the mood of the decade: don't feel guilty about a form of fundraising that's got a built-in bonus for the participants, who work hard to raise the cash and commit themselves to weeks of fitness training for the journey.</p> <p>But there are growing concerns that it's not always made clear to backers that only two thirds of the money goes to a good cause. It's even less in some cases: Mencap will get just over half of the proceeds of a cycle ride in Costa Rica this year. Airfares, hotels, food, guides and assistance for the cyclists will absorb an alarming 45% of the money raised. Mencap's Sarah Joseph says it's the first time they've been to Costa Rica, and setting up a new destination is costly. Even so, she agrees they've reached the limit with 45%.</p> <p>The Institute of Charity Fund Managers is so worried about challenges that it is drafting a code of practice to allay public misgivings about an idea that's brought a cash bonanza to many less well-known causes, and attracted younger volunteers to organisations that depend on declining numbers of mostly ageing helpers.</p> <p>Ironically, the code will be launched just as some charities are forecasting that the popularity of challenge trips will peak in the next year or two. 'There is a need for a code, so that nobody can be under any illusion about how a trip is financed,' says Janet South, who chairs the working party compiling the guidelines. Though most organisations tell participants to spell out how the scheme works to their sponsors, 'there is a chance of a donor saying to a participant, 'Hang on.

      "bodyText": "New century, new challenge. Trek through the Amazon rainforest, go white-water rafting on the Zambezi - or is horse-riding in Mongolia more your thing? Or perhaps an encounter with the 'real' Cuba the lazy tourists never see - on a bike? No wonder offbeat 'challenges', arduous and expensive though they are, have claimed the smart holiday slot. They offer a unique feel-good factor: apart from a registration fee of around \u00a3200, they're free - if you can persuade friends and colleagues to sign up for a sponsorship package of at least \u00a32,500. Two thirds of this goes to charity; the rest pays for your trip. With your new year resolution to adopt a less indulgent lifestyle wavering in the face of the January sales, there's never been a cannier moment for charities to pitch their fundraising holidays. Numbed by winter desolation, thousands of us will be sending off for brochures, offering adventures which cunningly mix altruism with exoticism. Packed with jazzy photos, cool prose and 24-hour enquiry hotlines, these brochures are as seductive as those of the big tour operators - except that the word 'holiday' is taboo. Though the number of trips is limited, exclusive destinations are added every year: the Inca trail in Peru has to be next summer's plum choice. Your friends and workmates will be anything but bored with your anecdotes and snaps - and impressed that you've raised at least \u00a31,500 for one of the 40 or so charities that run sponsored events. Indeed, the brochures are almost too successful: it's the lure of faraway places, the chance of moving through picturesque landscapes, meeting remote tribes and seeing ecological rarities that attracts customers. 'I don't think people who do this sort of thing are driven by a particular cause. The charity is secondary to the challenge,' says John Scourse of Guide Dogs for the Blind. Even so, in the post-trip euphoria, only a curmudgeonly colleague would dare to mutter that while you have indeed raised an impressive amount for a good cause, you've managed to get a 10-day freebie out of it - funded by sponsors who might not have been so generous had they realised this was part of the deal. Challenge holidays were the charity world's big idea of the 90s, and chimed brilliantly with the mood of the decade: don't feel guilty about a form of fundraising that's got a built-in bonus for the participants, who work hard to raise the cash and commit themselves to weeks of fitness training for the journey. But there are growing concerns that it's not always made clear to backers that only two thirds of the money goes to a good cause. It's even less in some cases: Mencap will get just over half of the proceeds of a cycle ride in Costa Rica this year. Airfares, hotels, food, guides and assistance for the cyclists will absorb an alarming 45% of the money raised. Mencap's Sarah Joseph says it's the first time they've been to Costa Rica, and setting up a new destination is costly. Even so, she agrees they've reached the limit with 45%. The Institute of Charity Fund Managers is so worried about challenges that it is drafting a code of practice to allay public misgivings about an idea that's brought a cash bonanza to many less well-known causes, and attracted younger volunteers to organisations that depend on declining numbers of mostly ageing helpers. Ironically, the code will be launched just as some charities are forecasting that the popularity of challenge trips will peak in the next year or two. 'There is a need for a code, so that nobody can be under any illusion about how a trip is financed,' says Janet South, who chairs the working party compiling the guidelines. Though most organisations tell participants to spell out how the scheme works to their sponsors, 'there is a chance of a donor saying to a participant, 'Hang on. You're having the holiday of a lifetime at my expense.'' The code will also advise charity officials, who insist that they need groups of 80 or 100 to make a sufficient profit, to consider the damage big numbers could cause in environmentally sensitive areas. It will also suggest that charities should pay for projects to help local people, so they're giving something back to the third world destinations they use. Many blameless charities already do all of this, but to forestall criticism are keen to explain themselves. After all, they have a lot to lose.

      "body": "<b>Ritt Goldstein was a justice of the peace and a millionaire when in 1995 he became heavily involved in a campaign to reform the US police. He was, he claims, immediately subject to a campaign of police harassment - his home and office were ransacked, his car tampered with, his life threatened. He felt that living in the US was like living in a concentration camp. Finally, in the summer of 1997, he flew to Sweden, where he now lives underground, having run away from a refugee reception area.</b> <p>My third New Year's Eve underground brings a frozen landscape of iced forests and snow-covered vistas. The sun will occasionally appear, its shimmering, crystalline beauty given an illusion of warmth, but the thermometer dips to minus 35 degrees. It doesn't take long for the cold to bite at your extremities, the air tickling your nose as it freezes any moisture it encounters. Yet harsh as this life may be, it remains infinitely preferable to the life I endured in the States, the life to which I know I would be returned if the Swedish police were to arrest and deport me.</p> <p>In July 1997, I stood at New York's Kennedy Airport clutching a ticket to Sweden. I called a few friends to make my farewells, thinking this may be the last time I would see my home. As hard as things were in America, it was not easy to say goodbye.</p> <p>But my life as a refugee had really already begun in my home country after I had organised a police accountability hearing in my home state of Connecticut and my home and offices were destroyed in retaliation. That year, I spent the holidays alone at a hotel, virtually under siege. I found myself increasingly alone.</p> <p>Those in stronger minority communities have often come together against acts of police abuse - remember the riots that followed the beating of Rodney King? But mainstream America has never mobilised when the target of abuse is someone white and well-off. It is paradoxical that, in a country in which many believe police abuse has reached epidemic proportions, so many victims become increasingly isolated and are treated as lepers.</p> <p>In the summer of 1997, I began to realise just how isolated I'd become. Life's most simple pleasures - a home, a relaxed meal, companionship, shopping, even a walk in the park - were denied me. Unpredictable daily assaults left me a ghost among the living. My world was steadily being destroyed and there was nothing I could do to stop it.</p> <p>Those few friends who had stood by me now urged me to flee, for my own safety. Eventually, the realisation that there was no possibility of domestic protection led me to begin the journey I continue today.</p> <p>At many points, all that had kept me going was the thought that I had to endure, not for myself, but for the same reasons others throughout history have found ways to endure for their country - it was very difficult to leave. On the plane, safe for the first time in recent memory, I made an effort to put the past behind me. I arrived at Stockholm's Arlanda airport knowing no one, but I contacted a local chapter of Amnesty International and the following week met with their Swedish section. With their help, I found legal counsel and became acquainted with the political asylum issues I faced. Then, shortly after my arrival in Sweden, I applied for political asylum. I was informed that many who do so are immediately incarcerated and sent back on the earliest plane, but I was fortunate in that I had masses of evidence of what had happened to me in the States.</p> <p>While awaiting the outcome of my application, I was assigned a place in the Carlsund refugee camp outside Stockholm. Carlsund is a processing centre for refugees entering the country (I had entered as a tourist). I was later told it was the best of the country's camps. It is made up of low-lying brick buildings, set among greenery and groves of mature trees. That summer, wild flowers grew everywhere and as I watched children playing along the wooded pathways, I reflected that, compared with many of those in America's inner cities, they were lucky.</p> <p>At Carlsund, organised recreation, a gym, cooked meals and clean facilities were provided. I was assigned to a room in a dormitory called Club. Except for those refugees who were held in a unit called X-House, we were free to come and go as we pleased; many, like me, travelled regularly to Stockholm.</p> <p>After a few weeks of 'processing', I and many others were transferred to Flenn, a camp where the showers reeked of human waste and conditions can best be described as difficult. Everything that Carlsund was, Flenn was not, although, in all fairness, I did find many of the staff both sensitive and deeply committed.</p> <p>Most of the other refugees at the camps were from Iraq, Iran, the former Soviet Union, the Balkans, Africa and Afghanistan. I was the only American, of course, and more than a few of both camps' residents were not fond of the States. Many, notably the Afghanis and Iraqis, expressed a belief that they had become little more than pawns in America's political struggles and they harboured deep-felt resentment.</p> <p>My first days had some interesting moments, but even across the barriers of culture and language, understandings can be reached. In Carlsund and later Flenn, I soon found myself on friendly terms with a number of other refugees. Although my background was very different from their own, we shared a common bond in that we had escaped those who had sought to kill us. We considered ourselves members of a special club. When it appeared that I might be deported, there were those among them who provided a way to contact local activists, affording me a chance to escape the fate my return to the US would mean.</p> <p>In mid-September of 1997, after preparations had been pursued with the refugee group FARR (the Swedish Network of Asylum and Refugee Groups), I left Flenn and made my way to a pre-arranged location in Stockholm. Officially, I was in the city for a visit; when, days later, my asylum application was rejected, I entered life underground.</p> <p>I had been given the name and phone number of a young activist who had offered to shelter me. I called him and we arranged to meet at a subway station. Instead I was met by another activist and my circumstances reviewed, in detail, before I was finally allowed to meet my prospective host. Those working in the underground here are careful: they do not like to make mistakes.</p> <p>In Sweden, for asylum seekers facing deportation, going underground is the only option. Since October 1997, I have been hidden by activists all around the country. What that means is living and travelling with people who only minutes before were strangers, moving regularly to avoid detection and living in the shadows as a virtual fugitive. The Swedish police have an order for my arrest and deportation.</p> <p>In those first days, I stayed in Stockholm with groups of young activists; I slept on couches and in closets, but I was free. Since then, I have lived in a typical Swedish home, in a dilapidated house in the woods, even in a 50-room castle.</p> <p>It is surprising how many people I have met here who share a commitment to seeing justice done and who have chosen to help. My hosts have ranged from the young and struggling to comfortably-off, middle-aged professionals. Living as an underground exile, the only reason I am alive today is because of them. As an American, I stand out, so most opportunities for 'off the books' employment are denied me and I exist on the generosity of others. People I have never met but who have become familiar with my circumstances have taken considerable risks and expended more than a little time, effort and money on my behalf. Through the 'little victories' their sacrifices have brought, I am able to continue.</p> <p>Here in underground exile, one is forced to acknowledge that everything you ever knew and worked for has effectively been stolen from you, even your name - I must live under an assumed one. The press has noted that I was once a self-made millionaire, having built a successful business in addition to a police reform movement, but now, as a non-person in hiding, I have no opportunity to start anew. Having a driver's licence, a bank account or a business all require that a person officially exists - I do not.</p> <p>I have been described as 'the man who fled the US in search of freedom'. I can only hope that the New Year will allow me to find it.</p>",

Instead I was met by another activist and my circumstances reviewed, in detail, before I was finally allowed to meet my prospective host. Those working in the underground here are careful: they do not like to make mistakes. In Sweden, for asylum seekers facing deportation, going underground is the only option. Since October 1997, I have been hidden by activists all around the country. What that means is living and travelling with people who only minutes before were strangers, moving regularly to avoid detection and living in the shadows as a virtual fugitive. The Swedish police have an order for my arrest and deportation. In those first days, I stayed in Stockholm with groups of young activists; I slept on couches and in closets, but I was free. Since then, I have lived in a typical Swedish home, in a dilapidated house in the woods, even in a 50-room castle. It is surprising how many people I have met here who share a commitment to seeing justice done and who have chosen to help. My hosts have ranged from the young and struggling to comfortably-off, middle-aged professionals. Living as an underground exile, the only reason I am alive today is because of them. As an American, I stand out, so most opportunities for 'off the books' employment are denied me and I exist on the generosity of others. People I have never met but who have become familiar with my circumstances have taken considerable risks and expended more than a little time, effort and money on my behalf. Through the 'little victories' their sacrifices have brought, I am able to continue. Here in underground exile, one is forced to acknowledge that everything you ever knew and worked for has effectively been stolen from you, even your name - I must live under an assumed one. The press has noted that I was once a self-made millionaire, having built a successful business in addition to a police reform movement, but now, as a non-person in hiding, I have no opportunity to start anew. Having a driver's licence, a bank account or a business all require that a person officially exists - I do not. I have been described as 'the man who fled the US in search of freedom'. I can only hope that the New Year will allow me to find it.",

He studied history at Leicester University in the 60s but got a summer job at Agnew's, the art dealers, and worked on the catalogue for a Van Dyck show. From that point on he became addicted to art, including contemporary art. 'I don't accept the idea that art is over and past ages were better or worse, because they were just different.

It may be fascinating, or it may just be exhausting. 'We're trying to demonstrate that at that moment many options were open to the world of art,' says Rosenthal. This desire to illustrate a 'moment' is what he says all his exhibitions do.

A good Royal Academy show is like one imagines a Paris salon in the 19th century to have been: art at the centre of city life. The danger of blockbuster exhibitions is that they might kill the thing they love.

      "body": "<p>Two hundred years ago, fashionable ballet circles took the view that dance movements executed below the waist were somehow more vulgar and less beautiful than those above. Legs and feet constituted the 'mechanical part' of the art, while the face and arms expressed its 'soul'.</p> <p>Not surprisingly, this opinion hasn't lasted, for what most obviously distinguishes dance from the other performing arts is that it gets around on its feet. Music, singing, acting and reciting can all be done on the spot. Dance, uniquely, makes beauty out of covering ground, which is why dancers' feet are objects of such fascination.</p> <p>The ballerina's foot, in particular, is a breed apart from the ordinary mortal's. Her pointed toe is a potent image of her erotic and exotic otherness. It is the miraculously fine base on which she balances, creating the gravity-defying illusion that allows her to transform into sylph, princess or superwoman. It is the exquisite instrument with which she articulates the detail of classical footwork, and it is the source of intense dramatic contrast - stabbing the floor, caressing the air, quivering with a kind of blind physical intelligence.</p> <p>Yet it's also a valiantly hard-working body part. On this small, complex construction of bone, muscle and tendon the entire weight of the dancer frequently has to rest, and the foot pays a price. Professional dancers are usually loath to show them to outsiders, for the damage and distortion can be shocking.</p> <p>Strip away the ballerina's satin slipper and you'll often find a mess of bunions, blisters, corns and crooked toes. Sarah Wildor, principal dancer with the Royal Ballet, says wistfully: 'My feet might have been quite nice if I hadn't been a dancer.' Her special source of martyrdom is the corns that grow between her toes, due to the pressure placed on the bones. She trims the corns to keep them under control, but she has 'a really horrible soft one, between the fourth and fifth toes' whose only effective treatment would be an operation to shave the bone.</p> <p>If dancers' feet are studied through a medical scan, even worse damage becomes visible. Lucy Haith, head of physiotherapy at the Royal, says such a scan will show up all areas of potential or actual stress fracture to the bone and, while a normal person's should reveal none, a classical dancer's will typically reveal several. 'Dancers bear their weight through the tips of two toes - the big toe and the second toe - and obviously we weren't designed to do that,' she says. 'But stress fractures are caused not only by dancing on point but also by jumping. Athletes have highly designed shoes to absorb the shock of landing; dancers wear nothing to minimise the impact.' Add to this the frequent hazard of tendinitis (inflamed or swollen tendons) and you have a chiropodist's nightmare.</p> <p>The Royal, like any sensible ballet company, doesn't encourage suffering. Dancers are instructed to get their feet, or any part of their body, looked at as soon as they feel any pain. Yet ever since Marie Taglioni and her early-19th-century sisters first hoisted themselves up on the tips of their toes, masochism has been part of the ballerina's image. We read with awe of Taglioni being drilled by her father to fainting point in order to master the technique of toe dancing, of Anna Pavlova exiting the stage and leaving a trail of bloody footprints.</p> <p>In Taglioni's era, dancers didn't even have blocked shoes to support their endeavours, merely lines of darning to stiffen the toes of their slippers. Today's ballerinas have slightly more to stand on. The boxed toe of the modern shoe is constructed out of tightly packed layers of wadding and shellac that provides a tiny platform on which to balance. But while this greatly enhances the technical possibilities of pointwork, it doesn't magic away the pain.</p> <p>Wildor admits that her feet are 'agony really. During a performance the pain is the last thing on my mind but when I come off stage my feet are killing me.' </p> <p>Darcey Bussell agrees that 'you basically numb your mind to the pain'. She has an easier time than Wildor - 'I can go for up to three days without my feet really hurting' - but she has a nasty bunion, which she has to keep strapped up and frequently bleeds, and the inevitable blisters where her skin is rubbed raw.</p> <p>For prepubescent ballet students the blood that's drawn from their first chafing, wobbling efforts to stand on point is, however, a mark of maturity. Bleeding blisters and bunions are the stigmata of the profession, and the most enthusiastic fans covet the worn, stained shoes in which a favourite dancer has performed.</p> <p>So crucial is the ballerina's point shoe to her image that when early 20th-century choreographers rebelled against ballet they danced in bare feet. No longer shod in delicate satin, no longer poised in the act of flight, Martha Graham and other pioneers of modern dance proclaimed themselves women of the earth. Their bare feet were firmly on the floor, providing leverage for the dancers' bold, blunt, passionate moves. They were also styled in stark opposition to classical feet, flexed rather than pointed, placed parallel rather than turned out. For years, modern choreography was popularly referred to as barefoot dancing, for that naked, unadorned foot symbolised the emotional and physical frankness of the whole aesthetic.</p> <p>In the 60s, when a new wave of minimalists aimed to democratise dance, the look of the foot was crucial. Graham's bare foot had a religious high tone about it, so 60s dancers wore sneakers and rarely stylised their feet into flexed or pointed shapes. The image was casual and functional. Then in the 80s, when choreographers invented the urban, gutsily physical style of Eurocrash, the Doc Marten became the footwear of choice. Dancers shod in these tough, clunky shoes could stamp and kick as hard as they liked, and the noise they made added dramatically to the energy of their moves.</p> <p>Yet the use of the foot as percussive instrument is as old as dance itself. Black African dance, tap dance, clog dance, Irish dance, south Asian dance - all these genres work the feet as a drumming accompaniment. While ballet dancers aim for an otherworldy silence, many other dancers wear shoes to maximise their noise. The metal caps favoured by tap and Irish dance are contrived to rap out every shuffle, tap and stamp as loudly as possible - with productions such as Riverdance using a miked stage to intensify the sound.</p> <p>Many south Asian dancers wear bells around their ankles for a similar effect, yet it's amazing how much sound they can produce from stamping out their percussive moves with bare feet. Choreographer Shobana Jeyasingh says that stamping is the wrong verb: 'What we do is more like clapping - we clap the air with our feet.' To do this correctly the feet have to be relaxed, so that they feel no pain. However, it requires a tremendous amount of power and some dancers suffer from fallen arches as a result. Others find knees and lower backs are affected by the strain.</p> <p>In fact, they can't wear shoes at all. Most south Asian dance forms originated in the temples, where shoes were removed as a mark of respect. Even today, it's considered sacrilege to dance in shoes, and this ban gave Jeyasingh huge problems when her company took part in the grand parade in Paris marking the bicentenary of the French revolution. She couldn't let her dancers go barefoot down the Champs Elys\u00e9es, yet she could hardly put them in trainers. She compromised by putting them in tiny slipperettes, which were camouflaged by patterns of henna.</p> <p>When word got out in Indian dance circles, Jeyasingh was castigated by some diehard purists - and her dilemma oddly reverses that of revolutionary ballet choreographer Mikhail Fokine in 1907. He had created a ballet in which the dancers were to perform barelegged and barefoot, but the management of the Imperial Ballet in St Petersburg thought this such an affront to the dignity of the artform they forced the dancers into tights with toenails painted on.<br>Slippered or naked, pointed or flexed, the foot still has the power to bewitch and to shock. It is not only the defining image of different styles of dance - it is also the focus of dance's mystique. </p> <p>\u0095 Darcey Bussell and Sarah Wildor's feet can be seen in the Royal Ballet's Nutcracker, at the Royal Opera House, London WC2 (0171-304 4000), till January 10.
