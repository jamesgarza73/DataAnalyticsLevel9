In November, he told a conference attended by Tony Blair that it was no longer necessary to choose between growth and environment. He took as evidence Natural Capitalism, The Next Industrial Revolution (Paul Hawken and Amory and Hunter Lovins, Earthscan, pounds 18.99), which 'proves beyond argument that there are presently available technologies, and those just on the horizon, which will permit us to get richer by cleaning, not by spoiling, the environment. This is a huge deal,' Clinton said. </p> <p> It's a suitably millennial claim. The authors argue that 'capitalism, as practised, is a financially profitable, nonsustainable aberration in human development... [which] does not fully conform to its own accounting principles.

It neglects to assign any value to the largest stocks of capital it employs, the natural resources and living systems, as well as the social and cultural systems that are the basis of human capital.' </p> <p> Companies, as has been well said, are brilliant externalising machines, pocketing the profits and shunting the costs of their enterprise on to the collectivity. Thus, the NHS pays for the profits of big tobacco, and the Government subsidises cars by building roads. Put it another way, business is a free rider on the environment and the services it provides, services which have been tentatively valued by Nature magazine at $36 trillion annually, roughly the same as world GDP. </p> <p> The reason business is so profligate with the the environment (the 'natural capital' of the book) is that its goods are assumed by economists to be free and infinitely substitutable. So they are uncosted. But in reality they are not free. They are produced by the earth's 3.8-billion-year store of natural capital which, as the authors rehearse with hair-raising thoroughness, is being eroded so fast that by the end of this century there will be little left. And there is no conceivable substitute, for example, for the biosphere's ability to produce oxygen. </p> <p> The authors manage to recast this rush to disaster as a story with a (potentially) happier ending. Their grounds for optimism are partly familiar American technological optimism, if natural resources were treated as scarce and expensive, then nanotechnology and biotechnology could multiply four or even tenfold the outputs from today's inputs. Hence Clinton's enthusiasm. </p> <p> But more crucial to the project is a complete mental flip of what an 'output' consists of (as Edwin Land once said, a great idea is often 'not having a new thought but stopping having an old one'). </p> <p> At present, it is entirely conceivable that one-quarter or even half of the GDP of advanced countries makes not value but waste. Most industrial processes, and the economy as a whole, are inefficient , at best achieving 10 per cent of their potential likewise their products. A car uses just 1 per cent of the energy it burns to propel the driver, the rest to warm the atmosphere, deafen pedestrians and shift ponderous steel boxes between traffic jams. </p> <p> Moreover, waste is cumulative, so an increasing income has to be spent on alleviating growth's byproducts, pollution, traffic accidents and congestion, crime. Hence the phenomenon of uneconomic growth, where increases in nominal wealth produce no net gain in quality of life or standard of living: in real terms 80 per cent of Americans are no better off than they were in 1979. </p> <p> However, the grossness of the waste is, say the authors, also a measure of the huge potential for improvement if the spiral changed to virtuous. The secret is taking a systems view in which it is always more expensive to get rid of waste than to design it out in the first place.

      "body": "<p>Two years ago I spoke to a footballer who grew up poor in southern Europe and now plays for one of the biggest Italian clubs. He said that when he drove his sports car through the neighbourhood of his birth he felt guilty. </p> <p>Something was wrong. </p> <p>Many other players seem to feel the same. A man who knows both Diego Maradona and Romario thinks that their weird behaviour is largely due to that sense of unease. Both players grew up in slums, still claim to be political radicals (Maradona hangs out with Fidel Castro, Romario campaigns for left-wing politicians), but are always splashing out, partying and fighting. They love luxury but feel guilty about it. The combination prompts self-destruction. </p> <p>All this is worth saying because the debate about footballers' pay is raging again. Roy Keane has negotiated a salary of \u00a350,000 a week, Darren Anderton is demanding more than half that to stay at Spurs, and Sam Hammam, Wimbledon owner, predicts that soon some players will be earning \u00a320 million a year. </p> <p>The usual line is that footballers now earn unparalleled amounts, particularly in England, and cannot see the problem with it even though they themselves grew up poor; in short, that they are on 'ridiculous wages'. (It is odd that when it comes to footballers, people still talk about 'wages', the working-class word for salaries.) </p> <p>Whether their salaries are ridiculous or not is a moral judgment, and therefore impossible to resolve. What can be said for certain is that many of the arguments currently being made are ridiculous. </p> <p>Firstly, some footballers do see a problem with their salaries. Even in the 1980s there was a QPR forward, Ian Stewart, who turned down a pay rise. Admittedly there have been no recent reports of footballers doing the same, but many do give away lots of money. George Weah subsidises much of the Liberian population, Lucas Radebe demanded a salary from Leeds that would set up his dozen or so siblings for life, and Mauro Milanese, an Italian defender with Perugia, has just given Ronaldo a sponsored Brazilian child as a wedding present. It must be said that at Manchester United players continue to spend their money on worthwhile things, like trousers or Ferraris. </p> <p>Secondly, it is nonsense to say that footballers grew up poorer than most people. Yes, Maradona and Romario grew up in slums, but so did many Latin Americans. Countless footballers were raised wealthy: Marcel Desailly, son of an African diplomat, Gianluca Vialli, son of an Italian industrialist, the chic Brazilian brothers Socrates and Rai, the chic Danish Laudrups, and Paolo Maldini, son of a football manager. </p> <p>The slums do not produce a disproportionate number of footballers. </p> <p>Rather, the best indicator of whether or not you will become a good player is whether your father was one. Pele, Michael Owen, Maldini and the Laudrups are all children of ex-pros. Football is a family trade, like being a doctor or a hangman. </p> <p>It is also ridiculous to argue that footballers' pay is unique, existing in a biosphere of its own. The most generous employers in Britain are not Manchester United or even Newcastle United but large merchant banks, law firms and high-tech companies. The National Lottery has probably produced more millionaires than all of British football. Microsoft alone has created about 10,000, most of them in the Seattle area. Even the company's head lawyer, William Neukom, is worth $625 million. That too may be a 'ridiculous' amount of money, but it certainly implies that football is not uniquely ridiculous. </p> <p>And it is also false to say that within football the most 'ridiculous wages' are paid in England. In a recent survey of footballers' salaries by World Soccer, Alessandro del Piero of Juventus topped the global list with a monthly salary of about \u00a3275,000. In second place was an Englishman, but an Englishman who plays abroad: Steve McManaman of Real Madrid on \u00a3260,000 a month. Christian Vieri was estimated to earn \u00a3220,000 a month and his Inter team-mate Ronaldo \u00a3200,000, about the same as Keane's new salary. The second-best paid player in England was Alan Shearer, with just \u00a3112,000 a month. </p> <p>The survey did prove conclusively that there is no link between playing well and earning lots. Zinedine Zidane earns a little over a third as much as his Juventus teammate Del Piero, while Holland's best paid player is Irishman David Connolly, who after failing at Feyenoord was sent on loan to a small first-division club, Excelsior, where he pockets \u00a377,000 monthly. </p> <p>Admittedly these figures ignore signing-on fees, bonuses and boot contracts. But some bankers or company executives receive options and Christmas bonuses worth several times their salaries. In the law, a transfer market has developed for the best barristers. Football is not alone. </p> <p>Arguing that footballers earn ridiculous wages remains a reasonable position. Most people in Britain argue exactly that. Yet they refuse to vote for any party that pledges to raise the top rate of income tax above 40 per cent. Even tax raises for the super-rich go down very badly. The current talk about ridiculous wages will surely remain just talk.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Two years ago I spoke to a footballer who grew up poor in southern Europe and now plays for one of the biggest Italian clubs. He said that when he drove his sports car through the neighbourhood of his birth he felt guilty. Something was wrong. Many other players seem to feel the same. A man who knows both Diego Maradona and Romario thinks that their weird behaviour is largely due to that sense of unease. Both players grew up in slums, still claim to be political radicals (Maradona hangs out with Fidel Castro, Romario campaigns for left-wing politicians), but are always splashing out, partying and fighting. They love luxury but feel guilty about it. The combination prompts self-destruction. All this is worth saying because the debate about footballers' pay is raging again. Roy Keane has negotiated a salary of \u00a350,000 a week, Darren Anderton is demanding more than half that to stay at Spurs, and Sam Hammam, Wimbledon owner, predicts that soon some players will be earning \u00a320 million a year. The usual line is that footballers now earn unparalleled amounts, particularly in England, and cannot see the problem with it even though they themselves grew up poor; in short, that they are on 'ridiculous wages'. (It is odd that when it comes to footballers, people still talk about 'wages', the working-class word for salaries.) Whether their salaries are ridiculous or not is a moral judgment, and therefore impossible to resolve. What can be said for certain is that many of the arguments currently being made are ridiculous. Firstly, some footballers do see a problem with their salaries. Even in the 1980s there was a QPR forward, Ian Stewart, who turned down a pay rise. Admittedly there have been no recent reports of footballers doing the same, but many do give away lots of money. George Weah subsidises much of the Liberian population, Lucas Radebe demanded a salary from Leeds that would set up his dozen or so siblings for life, and Mauro Milanese, an Italian defender with Perugia, has just given Ronaldo a sponsored Brazilian child as a wedding present.

Secondly, it is nonsense to say that footballers grew up poorer than most people. Yes, Maradona and Romario grew up in slums, but so did many Latin Americans. Countless footballers were raised wealthy: Marcel Desailly, son of an African diplomat, Gianluca Vialli, son of an Italian industrialist, the chic Brazilian brothers Socrates and Rai, the chic Danish Laudrups, and Paolo Maldini, son of a football manager. The slums do not produce a disproportionate number of footballers. Rather, the best indicator of whether or not you will become a good player is whether your father was one. Pele, Michael Owen, Maldini and the Laudrups are all children of ex-pros. Football is a family trade, like being a doctor or a hangman. It is also ridiculous to argue that footballers' pay is unique, existing in a biosphere of its own. The most generous employers in Britain are not Manchester United or even Newcastle United but large merchant banks, law firms and high-tech companies.

      "body": "<p><strong>Alistair Campbell on Burnley</strong></p> <p>Coventry versus Burnley, and unpleasant childhood memories come flooding back. </p> <p>I was nearing my twelfth birthday in 1969 and my present was to take to the game friends I'd been trying to convert to the Burnley cause since moving to Leicester from Keighley a few months earlier. As Burnley had already done the double over City (2-0 away, 2-1 at home) and already beaten Manchester United, Newcastle and Chelsea, and positively marmalised Leeds 5-1 (not to mention getting to the League Cup semi-final), these Leicester fans were ripe for recruitment . Like so many of my Burnley experiences, it ended in massive disappointment. A 4-1 thrashing and brutal mickey-taking all the way home. </p> <p>We suffered the same scoreline, and I the same humiliation, on the sole occasion I persuaded Tony Blair to watch Burnley, away at Hartlepool, the humiliation deepened by the sight of Peter Mandelson, 'well-known Hartlepool fan', boasting afterwards that 'we' beat 'you'. </p> <p>Yesterday's 3-0 defeat was by no means a humiliation. Indeed for 20 minutes in the second half I thought we might equalise, but then a second defensive error led to the second goal, the third came not long after and that was that. </p> <p>Looking back, there's no point denying the disappointments outweigh the moments of magic. When I was three, Burnley were League champions. The year I first saw them, aged five, we were two games away from winning the Double. I followed them from the very top to the very bottom. By the time I was 29, in 1987, we had to win 'The Orient Game' to stay in the League; a spectacular fall. Victory that day was as momentous in its way as those that had given us our two League championships and our 1914 FA Cup triumph. Having survived, every Burnley fan is convinced that though it's now a quarter of a century since we left the top flight, one day we'll be back. </p> <p>Go to Burnley on match days, and you know there's a game on. We get bigger crowds per head of local population than any club in the country, possibly the world (Manchester United would need about 300,000 a game to get near us, or so we tell each other). And go to parks and playgrounds in the town_if kids are wearing strips, they're Burnley strips, not Man U. There is a passion for the club that few can match. Ask all the former players who've settled there and go back every week. And I believe it's a passion reborn by the 'The Orient Game', when a whole community woke up to the significance of what it was they almost lost. </p> <p>Visitors to my office sometimes seem perplexed to see prominent on the wall a picture of David Eyres and Gary Parkinson, not exactly Burnley's most famous names, but our scorers when we beat nine-man Stockport at Wembley in 1994 to win promotion to Division One (from which, incidentally, we dropped a year later). It was magical purely by comparison with the ghastliness of years spent traipsing around uncovered away ends being patronised in programme notes. 'Great tradition but you're crap' was the general message. </p> <p>Or I think back to 1983, another relegation year (to Division Three) when we none the less got to the sixth round of the FA Cup and in the League Cup beat Bury, Middlesbrough, First Division Coventry and Birmingham before, on the day manager Brian Miller was sacked, thumping Spurs 4-1 at White Hart Lane. That feels a whole lot better when you've recently lost five on the trot, including a home defeat to loathed, despised, reviled Blackburn Rovers. And though we lost 3-0 in the semi-final first leg at Liverpool, we beat them 1-0 in the second leg, so that was magical too, even if we missed the last train home. </p> <p>It's been such a topsy-turvy time that there is a select band of people who are not only members of the 92 Club (93 including Wycombe) but who have seen Burnley play at all 93 and who long for a Cup tie with Cheltenham to make in 94. It's why we are able to boast, along with Wolves, of being one of just two clubs who have won all four divisional titles. Which reminds me of another magical moment, when second-time-around manager Brian Miller led out Burnley against Wolves in the 1988 Sherpa Van Trophy final. Laugh you might, but here's one for your quiz nights - when was the last time the Wembley crowd topped 80,000? Answer, the '88 Sherpa Van final... and, yes, we lost, which is why the magical moment came when the team emerged from the tunnel, hotly followed by disappointment. </p> <p>So when The Observer asks for my all-time 11, I'm afraid none of our recent players make it. The only two who come close are goalkeeper Marlon Beresford, now not playing for Middlesbrough, but who helped us from fourth to first in two years; and Steve Davis, part of the same side, who left for Luton and is now back for another spell. </p> <p>Nor is the team I've chosen an all-time 11 of the best players I saw, but those I remember. I was apparently at the final games of Jimmy McIl roy, reckoned to be the greatest player who ever wore claret-and-blue and who recently opened the fantastic new stand named in his honour, and Jimmy Adamson, still one of just two uncapped footballers of the year (the other is Tony Book). </p> <p>Older fans say that hearing McIlroy was going to Stoke was one of those 'where were you when...' moments, on a par with moon landings and presidential assassinations, so it is a cause of shame as well as regret that I have no recollection of him playing. Likewise with Adamson, on sleepless nights I urge my memory to throw up just a flash of him running with the ball at his feet, but to no avail. </p> <p>So it's Alan Stevenson in goal (what a pleasant surprise to see him at Coventry yesterday), Peter Noble, Colin Waldron, Brian Miller and Keith Newton in defence; a midfield trio of Trevor Steven, Martin Dobson and Ralph Coates and, up front, Andy Lochhead flanked by wingers Willie Morgan and Leighton James. If we were talking squads I could throw in Ray Pointer, Willie Irvine, John Connelly, Alex Elder, Frank Casper, Steve Kindon, Dave Thomas, Billy Hamilton, Brian Flynn, Adrian Heath and for sentiment's sake Neil Grewcock and Ian Britton who, as scorers of the goals that won 'The Orient Game' are photographically prominent in my home rather than merely my office. </p> <p>Given our history , on train journeys back it's fair to say we spend as much time on all-time worst teams as all-time best. Mine tend to come from the 'era' I stopped going, after John Bond became manager from 1983-84. He was a disaster, bringing his ways and his players from Manchester City, getting rid of Trevor Steven, Brian Laws and Lee Dixon and stripping Martin Dobson of the captaincy. </p> <p>Bond is as reviled in Burnley as Dobson was loved, so much so that when he went on to become Shrewsbury manager, and they played Burnley in the Cup, he didn't turn up, claiming his life was threatened. We drew 1-1. Bond reportedly went to the replay disguised as a steward and we won in the last minute. Another of those magical moments. </p> <p>Leighton James was - is - my favourite player of all time. A couple of years back I ran into him, and was reduced to groupie meeting pop star babble before telling my sons they'd just met the greatest footballer of all time, to which one of them said George Best looked a lot different on the telly. </p> <p>But I look at today's kids, millions of them who 'support' Man United, and pity them. The vast majority never get to see them play. And as their team has just won everything, including the Champions League, in the most breathtaking manner imaginable, all they've got ahead is disappointment. Those of us reared on disappointment will have far more truly magical moments in sport than those raised to expect that every game, and every trophy, is a piece of cake. For young United fans, the only way is down and, believe me, it's a hellish journey to make. </p> <p><strong>Michael Foot on Plymouth Argyle</strong></p> <p>Yesterday was Cup day and I had my seat for the game - just as I saw Argyle beat Reading in the third round. I reckoned, before kick-off, they were sure to beat Preston too. I started going when I was six or seven just after the First World War. I'd go every Saturday; to watch the first team one week, the reserves the next. The whole family were Argyle supporters but I was always keener than the others. </p> <p>We've always had a reputation for playing good football - keeping the ball on the ground and never losing our nerve - and the present manager Kevin Hodges has maintained that. We probably play better football than anyone else in the division, with the possible exception of Swansea. We have a tradition of trying, and often succeeding, in playing good football and I'm glad to see the crowds are getting larger. There were 13,000 for the game at Torquay and there were surely as many as the ground can hold for the game against Preston. We used to get 25,000 at Home Park but our stand was bombed during the war. There was quite a problem getting everything going again afterwards but the local spirit was very strong. I've always thought it was better than everyone else's but, of course, that's not true. </p> <p>The present team is on the way to the Premiership which is where they should be. We nearly made it before the Second World War. I can remember watching them beat Spurs 2-1 at White Hart Lane. Sammy Black was on the left wing, the greatest winger of his age, he could score equally well with his right or left foot. Then there was Jack Leslie, who was one of the first black players to play in the English league, at inside-left. He came from Africa and played about 20 years for Argyle. He was wonderfully skilled, more noted for his skill than his brawn, although his brawn was very considerable. He could have scored more goals but he was always keen to see his friend Sammy Black score. The captain was was Moses Russell, a Welsh international and was absolutely bald - before Yul Brynner made it famous - and by the end of the game his white pate would be black from heading the ball. </p> <p>We would have made it to the First Division, it was only the Second World War which stopped us. I always promised that I wouldn't conk out myself until we were there... I may be cutting it a bit fine. </p> <p>The game has changed. I'm absolutely opposed to the richer clubs buying up the whole game - that would be terrible. There should be more support for the smaller clubs otherwise there is a danger they will be driven out of existence, which would do an injury not just to football but to the social welfare of the country. The attachment of fans to their home team is one of the game's greatest attractions. </p> <p>Alastair Campbell and I agree on this. There are some people who support their local team for show, but not Alastair. He has real enthusiasm for Burnley and is a genuine football enthusiast. So are many of the others, they have backed their local team through thick and thin. Poor old Roy Hattersley is stuck with Sheffield Wednesday. </p> <p>Before the War, I used to watch that wonderful Arsenal team because of the Plymouth connection. David Jack, the other inside-forward alongside Alex James, was the son of Robert Jack who managed Argyle for 20 years. They were an extraordinary combination: Jack was six feet tall and James was two feet tall! </p> <p>At that time I can remember being down in Fleet Street and bumping into Alex James. That was real fame.</p>",

He was wonderfully skilled, more noted for his skill than his brawn, although his brawn was very considerable. He could have scored more goals but he was always keen to see his friend Sammy Black score. The captain was was Moses Russell, a Welsh international and was absolutely bald - before Yul Brynner made it famous - and by the end of the game his white pate would be black from heading the ball. We would have made it to the First Division, it was only the Second World War which stopped us. I always promised that I wouldn't conk out myself until we were there... I may be cutting it a bit fine. The game has changed. I'm absolutely opposed to the richer clubs buying up the whole game - that would be terrible. There should be more support for the smaller clubs otherwise there is a danger they will be driven out of existence, which would do an injury not just to football but to the social welfare of the country. The attachment of fans to their home team is one of the game's greatest attractions. Alastair Campbell and I agree on this. There are some people who support their local team for show, but not Alastair. He has real enthusiasm for Burnley and is a genuine football enthusiast. So are many of the others, they have backed their local team through thick and thin. Poor old Roy Hattersley is stuck with Sheffield Wednesday. Before the War, I used to watch that wonderful Arsenal team because of the Plymouth connection. David Jack, the other inside-forward alongside Alex James, was the son of Robert Jack who managed Argyle for 20 years. They were an extraordinary combination: Jack was six feet tall and James was two feet tall! At that time I can remember being down in Fleet Street and bumping into Alex James. That was real fame.",

      "body": "<p>A Chelsea bench boasting the mercurial talents of Roberto Di Matteo and Gianfranco Zola finally ended the visitors' frustration in front of goal as the former, with his first touch, set up Dan Petrescu for a thoroughly merited equaliser. </p> <p>Until that point, Chelsea appeared to be heading for an extraordinary loss as they failed to convert any of the seemingly endless reserve of chances they created in the Premiership's only match of the day. </p> <p>In an extraordinary start to the contest it took Bradford just 59 seconds to find the net and provide real hope that they could climb out of the bottom three. </p> <p>Unbeaten at Valley Parade since Sunderland sauntered to a 4-0 victory on the opening weekend in October, Bradford have recently shown genuine signs of a recovery that could yet see them kick off next season in the Premiership. </p> <p>Their major failing has been a lack of goals - 15 in 20 games before yesterday representing the Premiership's worst return - so such a start against a resurgent Chelsea was, to say the least, unexpected. </p> <p>A short pass from Robbie Blake found Dean Saunders on the right and the Welsh veteran's precise cross bisected Chelsea's central defensive pair and found the head of Lee Mills. It was a particularly sweet moment for Saunders, subjected to merciless verbal abuse by visiting fans who have still not forgotten his part in the collision that ended Paul Elliott's career. </p> <p>Still, personal retribution aside, it was a vitally important goal for the home team, not least because Chelsea's response was committed and instantaneous.

      "bodyText": "A Chelsea bench boasting the mercurial talents of Roberto Di Matteo and Gianfranco Zola finally ended the visitors' frustration in front of goal as the former, with his first touch, set up Dan Petrescu for a thoroughly merited equaliser. Until that point, Chelsea appeared to be heading for an extraordinary loss as they failed to convert any of the seemingly endless reserve of chances they created in the Premiership's only match of the day. In an extraordinary start to the contest it took Bradford just 59 seconds to find the net and provide real hope that they could climb out of the bottom three. Unbeaten at Valley Parade since Sunderland sauntered to a 4-0 victory on the opening weekend in October, Bradford have recently shown genuine signs of a recovery that could yet see them kick off next season in the Premiership. Their major failing has been a lack of goals - 15 in 20 games before yesterday representing the Premiership's worst return - so such a start against a resurgent Chelsea was, to say the least, unexpected. A short pass from Robbie Blake found Dean Saunders on the right and the Welsh veteran's precise cross bisected Chelsea's central defensive pair and found the head of Lee Mills. It was a particularly sweet moment for Saunders, subjected to merciless verbal abuse by visiting fans who have still not forgotten his part in the collision that ended Paul Elliott's career. Still, personal retribution aside, it was a vitally important goal for the home team, not least because Chelsea's response was committed and instantaneous. The ensuing eight minutes might have brought five Chelsea goals as the blue shirts flowed forward; pace, passing and excellent movement seeing the ball worked to the front two of Chris Sutton and Tore Andre Flo with ease. The best opportunity for an early equaliser came after just three minutes as home keeper Matt Clarke misjudged a Den nis Wise corner and presented defender John Terry with an unopposed shot on an open goal. The young Chelsea man must have been as surprised as anyone to find himself in such a position and his unconvincing shot was cleared off the line by Gunnar Halle. Within a minute Wise found Sutton for an off-target shot from distance, 60 seconds on and Albert Ferrer set up Wise for a strike that was parried by Clarke, then Flo missed the first two of a host of chances, shooting off target and then watching Clarke block a chance with his feet. Bradford were living dangerously and had to be thankful for Flo's profligacy as, twice more, the Norwegian striker wasted opportunities. But as the first half wore on, chances began to materialise in front of the Chelsea goal. Mills missed two good openings then Halle careered down the right and sent a fabulous left-foot strike curling towards goal where De Goey produced a smart, one-handed reflex save. After the interval, it was the turn of Gustavo Poyet to continue the trend of missed opportunities, shooting over an open goal from eight yards and heading over from a promising position. Mercifully Di Matteo's first touch, as a 57th minute substitute for Wise, saw him release Petrescu just inside the Brad ford half and the Romanian possessed the necessary pace and poise to carry the ball half the length of the field and slip it past Clarke.",

As a diva she's been part of the Lauryn Hill-Macy Gray generation, busy reshaping American soul music over the past few years. Intensely spiritual, she cites The Creator as her muse, lighting incense and candles before every performance.

However, Cambridge's threat up front was seen again in the 52nd minute, when Butler making it 2-1 Another team who failed to make the most of their home advantage were Grimsby. They fell 2-0 to Bolton,. Bolton's Icelandic international, Eidur Gudjohnsen. has a reputation for scoring difficult goals, and thanks to a static Grimsby defence, he he lived up to it on this occa sion with a fine right-foot shot into the net from the edge of the box. Bo Hansen scored Bolton's second. There were not many chances to be seen in Charlton's 1-0 win over QPR, especially from the visitors. They failed to register a single shot of target in the whole of the first half. Charlton, who had not exactly caused the opposing goalkeeper to work overtime themselves, broke the deadlock in the 68th minute through Charlie MacDonald. Blackburn, who will need all the defensive expertise they can get in tomorrow's fourth-round tie at Liverpool, have received an unexpected bonus - the likely return of their Irish Republic international goalkeeper, Alan Kelly. Kelly has made remarkable progress since being carried off with ankle ligament damage at Portsmouth on 28 December, an injury that was expected to put him out of action for between four and six weeks. Blackburn's manager, Tony Parkes, said: 'Alan told us that he is a quick healer, but for me, this is a miracle. Our physios are fairly confident he will be fit for Monday.'",

      "byline": "Amy Lawrence",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>If the thirtysomething Nigel Martyn doesn't feel relatively geriatric when he glances round the Leeds United dressing-room from time to time, he might sprout a grey hair or two when he looks at his opposite number this afternoon at Maine Road. There he will see a coltish goalkeeper brimming with boldness and burning with quality. He's a young man hurtling up a learning curve with such staggering accomplishment the old adage about keepers maturing late must be brought into question. </p> <p>Nicky Weaver contemplates the notion he is expected to peak in around a decade's time. 'That means I've got another 10 years of improvement,' he concludes. In an era when the delicate business of nurturing sporting prospects is threatened by salivating hype merchants, Manchester City's huge starlet possesses an easy nonchalance that may just see him through. He's serious about that improvement. At the moment he is working on his concentration to stop his mind from wandering during games. </p> <p>Weaver's life has changed radically since his sudden elevation to the City first team during last season's promotion campaign. Having been stuck in the reserves after a \u00a3200,000 move from Mansfield, he emerged as an overnight sensation, eventually notching up a club record 22 clean sheets and inspiring worship from the fans. At the season's climax, that dramatic play-off final against Gillingham, he etched his name into City folklore as penalty shoot-out hero. He seemed to symbolise a bright future running like an unchained maniac away from years of sorry depression. </p> <p>'Over the summer after that I used to watch it every morning when I got up; it took a month or six weeks for what I'd actually done to sink in,' he recalls. Was public perception altered with that moment? The reply only emphasises Weaver's level-headedness. 'Just saving two penalties doesn't make you a great goalkeeper. Obviously they were important saves but I think performances this year have been more pleasing for me. </p> <p>'Before the season started I was a bit nervous about stepping up into the First Division because I'd never played at that level before. I thought it would be a lot harder than it is. I soon realised it was just like last year, carried on as normal, and things have been going really well.' </p> <p>He has faith that the Division One leaders can sustain their run through to a successive promotion. Playing in the Premiership this time next year would be, he says airily, the realisation of his wildest dream. </p> <p>This afternoon he samples a taste of it against Leeds, currently the brightest exponents of the joys of youthful football in England. 'It's encouraging,' says the affable Weaver. 'Someone said a few years ago that you never win anything with kids. Man United proved them wrong and Leeds can do the same this year. They are not in a bad position, are they? I know a few of their players from under-21s and they are cracking players. Michael Bridges, Lee Bowyer, Harry Kewell, they are all matchwinners in their own right. I can't wait to face them. If we beat them it will send out a statement to everyone in the country that we do mean business.' He will also be measuring himself against the keeper he rates as the best on current form. </p> <p>Kevin Keegan has taken the hint and is a watchful admirer. Weaver brushes off the hype. 'I get nervous about games but not about what people expect. I expect certain levels from myself and try to meet them every time I play. It would be nice to have a good game, on the television, and be compared favourably with Nigel Martyn but everyone knows one game doesn't make you into a good keeper.'</p>",

      "bodyText": "If the thirtysomething Nigel Martyn doesn't feel relatively geriatric when he glances round the Leeds United dressing-room from time to time, he might sprout a grey hair or two when he looks at his opposite number this afternoon at Maine Road. There he will see a coltish goalkeeper brimming with boldness and burning with quality. He's a young man hurtling up a learning curve with such staggering accomplishment the old adage about keepers maturing late must be brought into question. Nicky Weaver contemplates the notion he is expected to peak in around a decade's time. 'That means I've got another 10 years of improvement,' he concludes. In an era when the delicate business of nurturing sporting prospects is threatened by salivating hype merchants, Manchester City's huge starlet possesses an easy nonchalance that may just see him through. He's serious about that improvement. At the moment he is working on his concentration to stop his mind from wandering during games. Weaver's life has changed radically since his sudden elevation to the City first team during last season's promotion campaign. Having been stuck in the reserves after a \u00a3200,000 move from Mansfield, he emerged as an overnight sensation, eventually notching up a club record 22 clean sheets and inspiring worship from the fans. At the season's climax, that dramatic play-off final against Gillingham, he etched his name into City folklore as penalty shoot-out hero. He seemed to symbolise a bright future running like an unchained maniac away from years of sorry depression. 'Over the summer after that I used to watch it every morning when I got up; it took a month or six weeks for what I'd actually done to sink in,' he recalls. Was public perception altered with that moment? The reply only emphasises Weaver's level-headedness. 'Just saving two penalties doesn't make you a great goalkeeper. Obviously they were important saves but I think performances this year have been more pleasing for me. 'Before the season started I was a bit nervous about stepping up into the First Division because I'd never played at that level before. I thought it would be a lot harder than it is. I soon realised it was just like last year, carried on as normal, and things have been going really well.' He has faith that the Division One leaders can sustain their run through to a successive promotion. Playing in the Premiership this time next year would be, he says airily, the realisation of his wildest dream. This afternoon he samples a taste of it against Leeds, currently the brightest exponents of the joys of youthful football in England. 'It's encouraging,' says the affable Weaver. 'Someone said a few years ago that you never win anything with kids. Man United proved them wrong and Leeds can do the same this year. They are not in a bad position, are they? I know a few of their players from under-21s and they are cracking players. Michael Bridges, Lee Bowyer, Harry Kewell, they are all matchwinners in their own right. I can't wait to face them. If we beat them it will send out a statement to everyone in the country that we do mean business.' He will also be measuring himself against the keeper he rates as the best on current form. Kevin Keegan has taken the hint and is a watchful admirer. Weaver brushes off the hype. 'I get nervous about games but not about what people expect. I expect certain levels from myself and try to meet them every time I play. It would be nice to have a good game, on the television, and be compared favourably with Nigel Martyn but everyone knows one game doesn't make you into a good keeper.'",

Chinese paper Youth Daily reported last week how the real estate company had decided that gambling-related corruption has destroyed the sport in China, and that Dalian, from whom Terry Venables signed one of the first two Chinese players to come to England, would now be 'dispensed with'. 'These teams are not playing football, they are putting on an act,' Wanda chairman Wang Jianlin told the paper. 'If such trends continue, there is no potential for Chinese football, and it's not worth expending effort on something that has no future.' </p> <p>Wanda - league champions four times in the last six years - made headlines here last year when they re-signed Sun Jihai from Crystal Palace, and then failed to pay Palace the \u00a3700,000 fee until Fifa forced their hand. No sooner had the money been handed over than Fifa banned Jihai for a year for headbutting a linesman. With Wanda losing their grip on the championship, the football association offering rewards in return for proof of match fixing, the national team still without a manager, and its captain Fan Zihyi, hero to a billion obsessive fans, still preferring life at troubled Selhurst Park to a return to China - Wang believes the game is in terminal decline.

The tournament, which opened last Friday, has drawn unprecedented media interest following the home nation squad's controversial topless calendar stunt - which, says Soccer Association chief exec Warren Fisher, has made up for the absence of America's World Cup winning stars ( Said&amp; Done , 2 Jan). 'Sure, the Australian public wants to see the best of the best,' says Fisher, 'and the withdrawal of all the American stars has caused some promotional difficulties, but the Matildas have attracted plenty of interest for themselves.' The nude calendars - which provoked furious protests despite full frontal striker Amy Taylor (above) claiming 'I did it to promote soccer and the women's side of things', certainly paid off. The first two print runs sold out quickly and demand is now expected to exceed 90,000 copies. Interest in the tournament - which the Matildas won last year with wins over Italy and Canada - has soared accordingly. 'We don't need to be obsessed about the U.S. stars not being here,' said Fisher. 'The public is inquisitive as to whether our calendar girls can actually play.' And can they? A 2-0 defeat to Sweden on Friday focused minds. 'Now they're really under pressure to perform,' says Fisher. </p> <p> <strong> Desailly - Headhunters are so charming</strong> </p> <p>Marcel Desailly may feel the Premiership is over-stocked with rough, uncultured cloggers, but he does have a soft spot for English fans. </p> <p>Referring to his time in Italy with AC Milan, Desailly explained last week that life on the Kings Road, Chelsea is an altogether more civilised experience. 'The Italian fan,' says Marcel, 'upon recognising you in a bar, places your coffee to one side to put his notebook there, pushes your little cake to make room for his pen and asks you for an autograph while calling his pals over for a chat. When he leaves without saying thank you, you find that your cappuccino has gone cold'. </p> <p>Desailly is happy that life in England with Chelsea's supporters means his drinks are taken at just the right temperature.

So while Barry Davies was giving his views on Mrs Becks and Sir Alec (with a c) while the action passed him by, where was BBC number one John Motson? Taking, it seems, the FA Cup moral line. 'They couldn't leave Match of the Day unprotected,' Motty tells us, 'especially with the FA Cup cover. It was a mutual agreement - Barry quite fancied it and I didn't mind staying behind.'

      "body": "<p>Painful, poignant memories Stan Collymore admits, are coming back and FA Cup weekend will not have helped. All around him are the echoes of this time 12 months ago when he sank into a clinical depression that caused him - and he drops it into the conversation with no change of matter-of-fact tone, so logical did it seem at the time - to contemplate suicide. </p> <p>Once you know that, it seems less significant that this has been a lost year in the footballing career of one of the country's most naturally talented players, a year that has turned the English game's greatest enigma into an isolated, vilified \u00a37 million outcast. And once you know that, the tendency to point a judgmental finger at this wounded but, gradually, now healing human being bravely opening up opposite you, there is a guilt at having bought into all the scornful, sensational stories ridiculing his plight. </p> <p>The one story that sticks brings remorse. Yes, he assaulted his then girlfriend Ulrika Jonsson in Paris on a visit to the 1998 World Cup finals and he is ashamed and sorry. The one-off moment of madness was, he says, 'a turning point' in his life, probably hurrying him to the depressive basement he reached and which led him to the Priory treatment centre in London to seek rehabilitation. </p> <p>Otherwise, he vehemently denies, and is taking legal action over, the suggestion that he showed pictures of Ulrika naked to team-mates while on loan at Fulham and that he flew into a violent rage when he found another female friend, Estelle Williams, with a man. He denies, too, a recent tale that he is about to quit and go and live in the United States. </p> <p>Collymore also resents the picture painted of him at Aston Villa, the club he has loved since boyhood, as a surly, uncooperative figure who has refused all loan moves and transfers, as well as efforts to motivate him; a mercenary content simply to pick up \u00a320,000 a week for the rest of the 18 months on his contract. </p> <p>He insists he is desperate for another chance to play after an illness from which he is recovering thanks to ongoing therapy and anti-depressants but has not been given a reason by the manager John Gregory why he is not considered for selection. 'How come,' he wonders, 'when I was at the Priory three days a week and at Villa for two last season, I was seen as an active member of the first-team squad but then, when I'm fit at the start of this season I was frozen out from day one?' </p> <p>The pleading in his question is a good sign; he cares again. A year ago he had no energy to. </p> <p>'It was the day of my birthday, 22 Jan uary, the day before we played Fulham in the FA Cup,' he recalls. 'I was sat on the settee at home and I was empty. I rang the Villa physio Jim Walker and said, \"Jim I need to see somebody.\" I had nothing left, physically or emotionally. If I'd had something physically, I would have gone out there. The emotional I could have overcome. As a footballer you can. </p> <p>'It had been coming on for more than two years, going back to my time at Liverpool. For two years at Nottingham Forest then 18 months at Liverpool I felt fit, on top of things, but then I saw a gradual decline in terms of performance and consistency, not just as a footballer but as a person. </p> <p>'I was tired all the time, sleeping a lot. I would get back from training at 1pm and sleep right through until the next morning. That wasn't unusual. Then I would have stages of being an insomniac where I couldn't sleep at all. Even going up the stairs was a chore. I had all sorts of physical tests and they came back A1.' Nor did a visit to a Birmingham psychiatrist help. </p> <p>'Then my agent showed me an article about the Priory and I thought \"I have got to do this\". I think I was probably open to it because my sister has been a psychiatric nurse for more than 20 years. I told the doctor there about the sleep and general lethargy. He showed me a book which told me that I had the classic symptoms of clinical depression.' </p> <p>When it emerged publicly that Collymore had been to the centre, the reaction of many - including the manager at Villa, he says - of 'how can you be depressed on X-amount per week,' cut deep into him. He wished indeed he could have bought himself out of it. </p> <p>There was plenty of advice. The Villa chairman Doug Ellis reckoned that hard work would see him through. Others told him to cheer up and enjoy his wealth and way of life, to pull himself together. It just made things worse. As if he didn't want to do all those things. Because he was ill, he simply could not. </p> <p>Was this the suicidal time? 'Yes. I was reading a really good piece about depression by Derek Draper, who used to be a spin doctor for the Labour Party, and he said that suicide for him was a practical solution, not a cry for help. I could understand that. He became so detached, he couldn't feel anything. Neither could I. </p> <p>'It's really hard to describe to somebody who is functioning normally and going through ups and downs what it is to be in an emotional void. Some people in the Priory would talk about self-harming and for a long time being an outsider, I would wonder why people cut themselves. Then I spoke to a girl in there and she said, \"it's because I can actually feel something then\". </p> <p>'When I was at Liverpool, I had my hair blond. My dad had left when I was five years old and now he did a piece in the papers saying black people shouldn't have blond hair. I remember feeling absolutely nothing. Looking back, I knew something was wrong with me. </p> <p>'A few days after the Fulham game, I sat at home and I considered suicide because I thought, \"Well, what's the alternative?\" It's like being in a bubble of nothing. It's as if somebody takes your brain out, takes your physical capabilities away. I would pinch myself but I just felt numb. You think back to days when you wake up as a kid and think, \"Great. New day, sun shining, go and play football with my mates, go and swim\", and I could remember what that felt like. Not having it, I felt I was being teased.' </p> <p>At the Priory, Collymore began Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, an examination of behaviour patterns that triggered his depressions, learning to recognise them and avoiding repeating them. It involved one-on-one and group therapy for relationship issues and naturally the Ulrika episode figured large. 'It was a chance to get to the bottom of it,' he says. 'It must have been part and parcel of the whole process, though at the time it just seemed a unique set of circumstances. </p> <p>'It was probably a defining moment in my life and hers. We still talk now and again. We get on well, we really do. I think we both learned a lot from that and other things that have happened subsequently. We are very alike in a lot of ways but I think as a couple we are better as friends than in a relationship. </p> <p>'If you take Paris out of the equation and we had met now, I wouldn't have gone into a relationship. It would have been more of a friendship because it was obvious from the outset that we had great likenesses but also rubbed each other up the wrong way. Because of our insecurities when they come together, they come together in a big way. To me she will always be very special and I know for a fact that I will be for her.' </p> <p>The lesson has been for him how to be assertive without being aggressive but the worry, he says, is that everything he does now is judged by the incident. 'It's what people still label you by. In a lot of situations subsequently, a justifiable argument I have with someone goes by the board because of that.' </p> <p>As at Villa. His routine of Monday and Friday at the club, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday at the Priory frustrated John Gregory and his team-mates. Collymore felt helpless. 'All the vibes were that it was a weakness but if people only knew how many times I would come and do a session even though I was on empty, maybe people would have a bit of respect rather than being condescending.' Indeed, the cheap chants of 'You're mad and you know you are,' at games now seem even more distasteful. </p> <p>'When I came back, one or two of the players said, \"What the fuck's going on?

Dion Dublin has recently done his neck badly and they had a meeting in the dressing room the next day to let people know that he was in hospital. I bet that didn't happen with me.' It is why Collymore finds Doug Ellis's suggestion of an apology for his absence last season hard to take; why should he apologise for illness? </p> <p>'To his credit, Mark Bosnich said, \"Hold on the lad's been ill\",' Collymore continues, 'and once I explained what the illness was, from then I think the players have been fine.' Does not the whole episode confirm, though, a reputation as being an uncommunicative loner in a dressing room, intense and not a team player? </p> <p>'I guess I am intense and that was one of the things that got me into a depression for so long,' he concedes. 'I think about things a lot. If I didn't have a good training session or if somebody would say something even as a joke, I would go away and chew over it or obsess over it. That's one of the things that gets you on a spiral. As it got worse, I couldn't take things with a pinch of salt. I wouldn't react to people, I would get down on myself. </p> <p>'Because stories have come out that I am unpopular, I was looking at myself and saying, \"Is there anything that I am doing that is vastly different from anybody else?\" The answer is no, though I can't speak for what people see in me. </p> <p>'A lot's been made of it, going back to Forest and Liverpool but when the opportunity to go back to Forest on loan came, a lot of the lads who were still there rang and asked if I was coming back because they thought it would be great if I did. </p> <p>'I still keep in contact with quite a few of the Liverpool squad and Jamie Redknapp especially has been really good. He has called at various times, when I was in the Priory, over Christmas and New Year. And this season at Villa the boys have been fine. I come in, I'm polite to everybody, I do my work, hang around for a bit and I go home pretty much the same as everybody else.' It is why he is baffled by his exclusion this season when he feels he has done everything the club have asked of him. </p> <p>Such as going full-time at the Priory. The coming and going, Gregory clearly believed, was disrupting the club last season so Collymore accepted the manager's advice to stay in. At the end of his treatment, Collymore then had a meeting at Doug Ellis's house, at which the chairman said he was looking forward to the return of a fitter player next season. Collymore went on holiday to New York and Arizona, running every day, and returned in pre-season a stone lighter and ready for action. </p> <p>He still awaits an explanation for his deep-freeze treatment at Villa. For a while he was out of the loop and Collymore enjoyed a new club and new people during his three-month loan at Fulham but declined a transfer. 'With incentives the deal was about the same as at Villa but it was just to the end of the season, which would have left me with nothing.' </p> <p>He has also turned down moves to Hearts and Montpellier, the latter an insulting one, he believes, with Villa asking him to go to the south of France for talks then him finding out he was expected to go through a trial while there.

I'm not. I want to play football and I'm fit and ready to play for Aston Villa. I know I can still do a job in the Premiership. The most disappointing thing is that it's my club. I came here as a kid watching training and the thing that sticks in my throat is that I have been left out to dry. The whole thing's been a sham.' </p> <p>Can he see a reconciliation with John Gregory? He blows out his cheeks. 'Reconciliation means two sides coming together. The best thing I could offer Aston Villa Football Club was to go into the Priory to identify all the issues, to try and work on them, to be a better employee for the club and to guarantee my next 20 to 30 years on the planet. Villa is my club and I wanted to be fit to play my best for them.' </p> <p>'I just want somebody to say, \"I want you to do well for me as a footballer. You have had your stuff but forget it. Let's start from today. Let's incorporate you in the team, get the best out of you.\" I don't want punishment or special treatment but to be equal and for people to take on board that I am me. </p> <p>'I've no doubt with the frame I was blessed with, having had no major injuries except a hamstring tear, with a fair wind I can play top-class football for years. I look at other strikers who have gone for multi-millions and won tro phies and I see my ability on a par, if not beyond theirs. I take on board all my problems but what I need now is a brave manager. </p> <p>'John Gregory says he has tried everything - mollycoddling me, the stick and the carrot. All he has ever said to me was when he came in, \"I want you to do well for the football club\" and - after the Ulrika thing - to come back pre-season and it would be my season. If that qualifies for doing everything, then everything is not enough in my opinion.' </p> <p>Yes, says Collymore, even though he loved Liverpool, he would have loved Alex Ferguson's transfer bid when at Forest to have been successful. Instead Ferguson bought Andy Cole. 'He's a great manager. He would have been straight with me.' </p> <p>'Whatever happens, whether I have a great turnaround in fortunes, whether somebody says, \"Yeah we want you to play\" or whether I sit it out until June 2001 and decide not to play again, I am enjoying life a lot more. I have learned a lot over the last year and I try to put it all into practice now. I still have good days and bad days but on a normal level now. As a person I have admitted the mistakes that I have made in my life and I want to get on now and do the best for myself and my family.' </p> <p>And this unhappy anniversary? 'It's been in the back of my mind. I have tried to do a lot of things this past year. I have tried to spend time on my own, to understand myself, and to go out and have some fun, because I didn't enjoy things for a long time. When I was at my lowest, I felt shot full of holes. Any bit of criticism would get inside me and churn me up. Now it's like there's filler in between.' </p> <p>'That day last January, if I hadn't gone to the Priory, I couldn't have guaranteed the next five hours on the planet. There's still a lot to resolve, in football and relationships, but now I can see a future. Life's not perfect but it's a hell of a lot better than it was this time last year.'</p>",

      "bodyText": "Painful, poignant memories Stan Collymore admits, are coming back and FA Cup weekend will not have helped. All around him are the echoes of this time 12 months ago when he sank into a clinical depression that caused him - and he drops it into the conversation with no change of matter-of-fact tone, so logical did it seem at the time - to contemplate suicide. Once you know that, it seems less significant that this has been a lost year in the footballing career of one of the country's most naturally talented players, a year that has turned the English game's greatest enigma into an isolated, vilified \u00a37 million outcast. And once you know that, the tendency to point a judgmental finger at this wounded but, gradually, now healing human being bravely opening up opposite you, there is a guilt at having bought into all the scornful, sensational stories ridiculing his plight. The one story that sticks brings remorse. Yes, he assaulted his then girlfriend Ulrika Jonsson in Paris on a visit to the 1998 World Cup finals and he is ashamed and sorry. The one-off moment of madness was, he says, 'a turning point' in his life, probably hurrying him to the depressive basement he reached and which led him to the Priory treatment centre in London to seek rehabilitation. Otherwise, he vehemently denies, and is taking legal action over, the suggestion that he showed pictures of Ulrika naked to team-mates while on loan at Fulham and that he flew into a violent rage when he found another female friend, Estelle Williams, with a man. He denies, too, a recent tale that he is about to quit and go and live in the United States. Collymore also resents the picture painted of him at Aston Villa, the club he has loved since boyhood, as a surly, uncooperative figure who has refused all loan moves and transfers, as well as efforts to motivate him; a mercenary content simply to pick up \u00a320,000 a week for the rest of the 18 months on his contract. He insists he is desperate for another chance to play after an illness from which he is recovering thanks to ongoing therapy and anti-depressants but has not been given a reason by the manager John Gregory why he is not considered for selection. 'How come,' he wonders, 'when I was at the Priory three days a week and at Villa for two last season, I was seen as an active member of the first-team squad but then, when I'm fit at the start of this season I was frozen out from day one?' The pleading in his question is a good sign; he cares again. A year ago he had no energy to. 'It was the day of my birthday, 22 Jan uary, the day before we played Fulham in the FA Cup,' he recalls. 'I was sat on the settee at home and I was empty. I rang the Villa physio Jim Walker and said, \"Jim I need to see somebody.\" I had nothing left, physically or emotionally. If I'd had something physically, I would have gone out there. The emotional I could have overcome. As a footballer you can. 'It had been coming on for more than two years, going back to my time at Liverpool. For two years at Nottingham Forest then 18 months at Liverpool I felt fit, on top of things, but then I saw a gradual decline in terms of performance and consistency, not just as a footballer but as a person. 'I was tired all the time, sleeping a lot. I would get back from training at 1pm and sleep right through until the next morning. That wasn't unusual. Then I would have stages of being an insomniac where I couldn't sleep at all. Even going up the stairs was a chore. I had all sorts of physical tests and they came back A1.' Nor did a visit to a Birmingham psychiatrist help. 'Then my agent showed me an article about the Priory and I thought \"I have got to do this\". I think I was probably open to it because my sister has been a psychiatric nurse for more than 20 years. I told the doctor there about the sleep and general lethargy. He showed me a book which told me that I had the classic symptoms of clinical depression.' When it emerged publicly that Collymore had been to the centre, the reaction of many - including the manager at Villa, he says - of 'how can you be depressed on X-amount per week,' cut deep into him. He wished indeed he could have bought himself out of it. There was plenty of advice. The Villa chairman Doug Ellis reckoned that hard work would see him through. Others told him to cheer up and enjoy his wealth and way of life, to pull himself together. It just made things worse. As if he didn't want to do all those things. Because he was ill, he simply could not. Was this the suicidal time? 'Yes. I was reading a really good piece about depression by Derek Draper, who used to be a spin doctor for the Labour Party, and he said that suicide for him was a practical solution, not a cry for help. I could understand that. He became so detached, he couldn't feel anything. Neither could I. 'It's really hard to describe to somebody who is functioning normally and going through ups and downs what it is to be in an emotional void. Some people in the Priory would talk about self-harming and for a long time being an outsider, I would wonder why people cut themselves. Then I spoke to a girl in there and she said, \"it's because I can actually feel something then\". 'When I was at Liverpool, I had my hair blond. My dad had left when I was five years old and now he did a piece in the papers saying black people shouldn't have blond hair. I remember feeling absolutely nothing. Looking back, I knew something was wrong with me. 'A few days after the Fulham game, I sat at home and I considered suicide because I thought, \"Well, what's the alternative?\" It's like being in a bubble of nothing. It's as if somebody takes your brain out, takes your physical capabilities away. I would pinch myself but I just felt numb. You think back to days when you wake up as a kid and think, \"Great. New day, sun shining, go and play football with my mates, go and swim\", and I could remember what that felt like. Not having it, I felt I was being teased.' At the Priory, Collymore began Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, an examination of behaviour patterns that triggered his depressions, learning to recognise them and avoiding repeating them. It involved one-on-one and group therapy for relationship issues and naturally the Ulrika episode figured large. 'It was a chance to get to the bottom of it,' he says. 'It must have been part and parcel of the whole process, though at the time it just seemed a unique set of circumstances. 'It was probably a defining moment in my life and hers. We still talk now and again. We get on well, we really do. I think we both learned a lot from that and other things that have happened subsequently. We are very alike in a lot of ways but I think as a couple we are better as friends than in a relationship. 'If you take Paris out of the equation and we had met now, I wouldn't have gone into a relationship. It would have been more of a friendship because it was obvious from the outset that we had great likenesses but also rubbed each other up the wrong way. Because of our insecurities when they come together, they come together in a big way. To me she will always be very special and I know for a fact that I will be for her.' The lesson has been for him how to be assertive without being aggressive but the worry, he says, is that everything he does now is judged by the incident. 'It's what people still label you by. In a lot of situations subsequently, a justifiable argument I have with someone goes by the board because of that.' As at Villa. His routine of Monday and Friday at the club, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday at the Priory frustrated John Gregory and his team-mates. Collymore felt helpless. 'All the vibes were that it was a weakness but if people only knew how many times I would come and do a session even though I was on empty, maybe people would have a bit of respect rather than being condescending.' Indeed, the cheap chants of 'You're mad and you know you are,' at games now seem even more distasteful. 'When I came back, one or two of the players said, \"What the fuck's going on? You just turn up on a Saturday.\" I said, \"Hold on a sec, I've had an illness, I've been in a clinic.\" The medical staff should have let everybody know. Dion Dublin has recently done his neck badly and they had a meeting in the dressing room the next day to let people know that he was in hospital. I bet that didn't happen with me.' It is why Collymore finds Doug Ellis's suggestion of an apology for his absence last season hard to take; why should he apologise for illness? 'To his credit, Mark Bosnich said, \"Hold on the lad's been ill\",' Collymore continues, 'and once I explained what the illness was, from then I think the players have been fine.' Does not the whole episode confirm, though, a reputation as being an uncommunicative loner in a dressing room, intense and not a team player? 'I guess I am intense and that was one of the things that got me into a depression for so long,' he concedes. 'I think about things a lot. If I didn't have a good training session or if somebody would say something even as a joke, I would go away and chew over it or obsess over it. That's one of the things that gets you on a spiral. As it got worse, I couldn't take things with a pinch of salt. I wouldn't react to people, I would get down on myself. 'Because stories have come out that I am unpopular, I was looking at myself and saying, \"Is there anything that I am doing that is vastly different from anybody else?\" The answer is no, though I can't speak for what people see in me. 'A lot's been made of it, going back to Forest and Liverpool but when the opportunity to go back to Forest on loan came, a lot of the lads who were still there rang and asked if I was coming back because they thought it would be great if I did. 'I still keep in contact with quite a few of the Liverpool squad and Jamie Redknapp especially has been really good.

      "body": "<p>Some famous football names are forever intertwined with FA Cup glory, and Tony Cottee has long suspected his might not be one of them. </p> <p>'I wouldn't say I was jinxed, I don't believe in fate to that extent, but I got the message loud and clear when I was at Everton,' he explained. 'When I went in 1988 they had won the league and the FA Cup within the previous three seasons. While I was there they won nothing, then when I left in 1994 they won the FA Cup the following season.' </p> <p>To make matters even worse Arsenal, the team Cottee turned down in favour of a move to Merseyside, managed the not inconsiderable haul of two titles, an FA Cup and a European Cup Winners' Cup during the same six-year period. </p> <p>Time is running out for the well-travelled Cottee, 34, who has yet to win a medal of any description in English football, and though he could have been forgiven for dreaming of a romantic run to Wembley in what may prove to be his last season in the top flight, the gods presiding over the fourth round draw clearly had other plans. </p> <p>'You can't get tougher than Arsenal away,' Cottee said resignedly. 'Even in a normal year that's a tall order, but with Manchester United out of the competition we've defi nitely drawn the shortest straw. It doesn't do to give up hope in this game, you won't get anywhere without confidence and self-belief, but let's just say if this is to be the season I finally get to play in an FA Cup final we will certainly have done it the hard way.' </p> <p>Cottee doesn't mind admitting he fancied Leicester's chances with the FA Cup holders out of the picture, only for the pairing with Arsenal to hit him like a personal slap in the face.

      "bodyText": "Some famous football names are forever intertwined with FA Cup glory, and Tony Cottee has long suspected his might not be one of them. 'I wouldn't say I was jinxed, I don't believe in fate to that extent, but I got the message loud and clear when I was at Everton,' he explained. 'When I went in 1988 they had won the league and the FA Cup within the previous three seasons. While I was there they won nothing, then when I left in 1994 they won the FA Cup the following season.' To make matters even worse Arsenal, the team Cottee turned down in favour of a move to Merseyside, managed the not inconsiderable haul of two titles, an FA Cup and a European Cup Winners' Cup during the same six-year period. Time is running out for the well-travelled Cottee, 34, who has yet to win a medal of any description in English football, and though he could have been forgiven for dreaming of a romantic run to Wembley in what may prove to be his last season in the top flight, the gods presiding over the fourth round draw clearly had other plans. 'You can't get tougher than Arsenal away,' Cottee said resignedly. 'Even in a normal year that's a tall order, but with Manchester United out of the competition we've defi nitely drawn the shortest straw. It doesn't do to give up hope in this game, you won't get anywhere without confidence and self-belief, but let's just say if this is to be the season I finally get to play in an FA Cup final we will certainly have done it the hard way.' Cottee doesn't mind admitting he fancied Leicester's chances with the FA Cup holders out of the picture, only for the pairing with Arsenal to hit him like a personal slap in the face. 'I just love going to Highbury,' he joked. 'Lovely ground, great atmosphere, and best of all, the supporters have such long memories. They all know that I went to Everton for more money than Arsenal were offering, they know I ended up with nothing while they were enjoying one of their greatest eras, and they never get tired of reminding me. 'I don't mind that, it's part of the fun, but it does get a bit boring. The only way I can shut them up is to remind them that had George Graham got me he might never have been in the market for Ian Wright.' The question hanging in the air is whether Cottee has ever regretted the choice of club he made as a 23-year-old, and the answer he is sticking with is no. 'Obviously with hindsight I can see things might have worked out very different for me had I gone to Arsenal from West Ham, but there's nothing to say I would have been a success at Highbury, and I might even have broken a leg or something and had no career at all,' he said. 'You can never see into the future, all you can do is try to make sure you are making the right decision for the right reasons and then stick with it.

Half of them wouldn't get out of bed for that sort of money any more, let alone go to the other end of the country, but at the time I was more than happy with the Everton deal.' It was Cottee's misfortune to arrive in time to discover that Colin Harvey's talent was for coaching and not management, and though Howard Kendall made a more favourable impression on his first return, the Everton that lurched unsteadily into the Nineties was already just a shadow of the moneybags outfit that had so confidently outbid Arsenal for his services. Cottee eventually decamped back to West Ham, where he averaged a goal every three games for a couple of seasons before surprisingly - in view of what has happened since - quitting English football for Malaysia. It is surprising because although he managed a cup-winner's medal in his one season with Selangor, 31 seemed a young age for a still-functioning striker to consider retiring.

      "body": "<p>Germany's opposition Christian Democrats struggled to maintain a show of unity yesterday - but there was no disguising the poisonous atmosphere engulfing the party as renewed bitterness followed reports that former Chancellor Helmut Kohl is backing a challenge to the leadership of his successor, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble.</p> <p>The liberal S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung newspaper claims that Kohl, angered by Sch\u00e4uble's efforts to distance himself from the scandal surrounding secret payments to the party, is encouraging a former Cabinet Minister, J\u00fcrgen R\u00fcttgers, to make a bid for the leadership at the CDU's annual conference in April.</p> <p>R\u00fcttgers - the party's candidate in a crucial state election in North Rhine-Wesphalia in May - is one of the few leading figures who has remained loyal to the former Chancellor since prosecutors began a criminal investigation into Kohl's financial dealings last week. Kohl has admitted accepting up to DM2 million in anonymous cash donations and channelling the money through secret accounts to local party organisations. The former Chancellor's supporters are outraged at Sch\u00e4uble's increasingly strident demands that Kohl should identify the donors to dispel suspicion that donations influenced government policy during his 16 years in power.</p> <p>Kohl is understood to have told friends he believes R\u00fcttgers would be a better party leader than Sch\u00e4uble. The S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung quotes him saying: 'My troops are ready.'</p> <p>A leadership challenge could be backed by party organisations in four states where local leadership has criticised Sch\u00e4uble's handling of the crisis. With one third of the delegates at the party conference coming from R\u00fcttgers' home state of North-Rhine Westphalia, the challenger would have a good chance of winning a majority.</p> <p>Kohl and R\u00fcttgers yesterday dismissed talk of a challenge as 'a pure invention', but as the CDU leadership ended a two-day strategy meeting near Hamburg the mood within the party was grim.</p> <p>Before the meeting began, Sch\u00e4uble delivered his sharpest criticism of the former Chancellor to date: 'The Kohl era ended when he lost the election in 1998 and quit as party chairman. Obviously we cannot take responsibility for things that happened before that we did not know about. There is no alternative to explaining as fully as possible breaches of the party funding law that Helmut Kohl has himself admitted and taking the appropriate consequences. No matter how bitter that path is, it is and remains the only option,' Sch\u00e4uble said.</p> <p>In a humiliating snub to Kohl, CDU activists in the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein have told him to stay away during the campaign leading up to next month's state election. The party's chances of defeating the governing coalition of Social Democrats (SPD) and Greens in the state have diminished as the scandal over party funding has damaged the standing of the CDU. 'Kohl's presence would not be helpful,' said Johann Wadephul, the CDU's campaign manager.</p> <p>R\u00fcttgers, on the other hand, made an elaborate display of loyalty to his old boss last week when he rounded angrily on party colleagues who called on Kohl to give up his parliamentary seat while the investigation continues. Many CDU activists, regardless of their feelings towards Kohl, regard R\u00fcttgers as having a better chance than Sch\u00e4uble of defeating Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der at the next federal election in 2002.</p> <p>Opinion polls show Schr\u00f6der's popularity has soared since the scandal broke and his Social Democrats are now 3 per cent ahead of the Christian Democrats. And as speculation rages about a possible leadership contest, new allegations emerged about the source of Kohl's secret donations. The weekly magazine Focus claimed a Munich construction magnate gave the former Chancellor 'a six-figure sum' in cash during the early 1990s. The magazine quoted a friend as saying that the businessman, who died in 1995, was 'quite astonished' when he discovered Kohl did not lodge the money in the CDU's official accounts.</p> <p>'I have no intention of making any comment on that,' Kohl said through a spokesman.</p> <p><b> Denis Staunton writes for The Irish Times </b></p>",

      "bodyText": "Germany's opposition Christian Democrats struggled to maintain a show of unity yesterday - but there was no disguising the poisonous atmosphere engulfing the party as renewed bitterness followed reports that former Chancellor Helmut Kohl is backing a challenge to the leadership of his successor, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble. The liberal S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung newspaper claims that Kohl, angered by Sch\u00e4uble's efforts to distance himself from the scandal surrounding secret payments to the party, is encouraging a former Cabinet Minister, J\u00fcrgen R\u00fcttgers, to make a bid for the leadership at the CDU's annual conference in April. R\u00fcttgers - the party's candidate in a crucial state election in North Rhine-Wesphalia in May - is one of the few leading figures who has remained loyal to the former Chancellor since prosecutors began a criminal investigation into Kohl's financial dealings last week. Kohl has admitted accepting up to DM2 million in anonymous cash donations and channelling the money through secret accounts to local party organisations. The former Chancellor's supporters are outraged at Sch\u00e4uble's increasingly strident demands that Kohl should identify the donors to dispel suspicion that donations influenced government policy during his 16 years in power. Kohl is understood to have told friends he believes R\u00fcttgers would be a better party leader than Sch\u00e4uble. The S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung quotes him saying: 'My troops are ready.' A leadership challenge could be backed by party organisations in four states where local leadership has criticised Sch\u00e4uble's handling of the crisis. With one third of the delegates at the party conference coming from R\u00fcttgers' home state of North-Rhine Westphalia, the challenger would have a good chance of winning a majority. Kohl and R\u00fcttgers yesterday dismissed talk of a challenge as 'a pure invention', but as the CDU leadership ended a two-day strategy meeting near Hamburg the mood within the party was grim. Before the meeting began, Sch\u00e4uble delivered his sharpest criticism of the former Chancellor to date: 'The Kohl era ended when he lost the election in 1998 and quit as party chairman. Obviously we cannot take responsibility for things that happened before that we did not know about. There is no alternative to explaining as fully as possible breaches of the party funding law that Helmut Kohl has himself admitted and taking the appropriate consequences. No matter how bitter that path is, it is and remains the only option,' Sch\u00e4uble said. In a humiliating snub to Kohl, CDU activists in the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein have told him to stay away during the campaign leading up to next month's state election. The party's chances of defeating the governing coalition of Social Democrats (SPD) and Greens in the state have diminished as the scandal over party funding has damaged the standing of the CDU. 'Kohl's presence would not be helpful,' said Johann Wadephul, the CDU's campaign manager. R\u00fcttgers, on the other hand, made an elaborate display of loyalty to his old boss last week when he rounded angrily on party colleagues who called on Kohl to give up his parliamentary seat while the investigation continues. Many CDU activists, regardless of their feelings towards Kohl, regard R\u00fcttgers as having a better chance than Sch\u00e4uble of defeating Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der at the next federal election in 2002. Opinion polls show Schr\u00f6der's popularity has soared since the scandal broke and his Social Democrats are now 3 per cent ahead of the Christian Democrats. And as speculation rages about a possible leadership contest, new allegations emerged about the source of Kohl's secret donations. The weekly magazine Focus claimed a Munich construction magnate gave the former Chancellor 'a six-figure sum' in cash during the early 1990s. The magazine quoted a friend as saying that the businessman, who died in 1995, was 'quite astonished' when he discovered Kohl did not lodge the money in the CDU's official accounts. 'I have no intention of making any comment on that,' Kohl said through a spokesman. Denis Staunton writes for The Irish Times",

While IQ has traditionally been the means by which we judge someone's abilities and potential, EQ - the E stands for Emotional - is the new benchmark for a new world. If you've got it, you're more likely to be powerful, successful and have fulfilling relationships than if you haven't. Emotional intelligence - the ability to understand and control your emotions, and recognise and respond to those of others - is emerging as the single most important and effective business and personal skill of the new century.</p> <p>At American Express, financial advisers who'd been through emotional intelligence training improved sales by up to 20 per cent, significantly more than the company average. A 10-year study by Sheffield University of over 100 small- and medium-sized UK businesses found that people management was three times as important as research and development in improving productivity and profitability and six times as important as business strategy.</p> <p>Daniel Goleman, a US science journalist-turned-consultant with a background in psychology, first popularised the notion of emotional intelligence in the mid-Nineties. He claims it is twice as important as cognitive (intellectual) or technical skills for high job performance and, at top level, virtually all-important. Analysing the profiles of top executives in 15 global companies, including IBM, PepsiCo and Volvo, he found what distinguished the 'star' performers was not superior technical or intellectual ability but emotional competence: political awareness, self-confidence, drive, influence.</p> <p>Using IQ as a measure of ability, Goleman believes, is outdated. Correlating IQ test scores with people's later success, he found IQ contributes, at best, 25 per cent and, at worst, 4 per cent. Suddenly you understand why all so many brilliantly successful people were academic no-hopers at school: they have exemplary EQ skills. Richard Branson, Mo Mowlam and Sir Brian Pitman (the guiding vision behind the Lloyds/TSB merger) are good examples.</p> <p>Goleman defines five elements of emotional intelligence: self-awareness, self-control, motivation, empathy and social skills. Sceptics argue this sounds suspiciously like the old 'soft' skills, in management-course speak, dressed up in new clothing. But Tim Sparrow, of human performance consultants Buckholdt Associates, points out there are two crucial differences. 'Soft skills training was only about interpersonal intelligence - relating to others. Emotional intelligence involves intrapersonal - knowing yourself - as well. You can't be interpersonally intelligent if you don't recognise feelings in yourself. Secondly, soft skills are considered a \"bolt-on\". That doesn't work for emotional intelligence, which is about cultural change, and needs to be knitted in to the whole business strategy.'</p> <p>But is it just another management fad? Not to mention a new money-spinner for the overcrowded consultancy industry? Malcolm Higgs and Vic Dulewicz, of the organisational behaviour faculty at Henley Management College, admit they were sceptical on first reading Goleman's work. They felt it was too anecdotally based and lacked rigorous testing. They subjected personal and competency data they had collected on 100 management and business leaders to more objective modelling. Crucially, the data tracked their advancement over a seven-year period.</p> <p>The results, they admit, staggered them. 'We were amazed at how consistent they were,' says Higgs. 'It was the same message: emotional intelligence was more highly related to success than IQ alone.'</p> <p>The rise of emotional intelligence is directly linked to the new world of work. Increased globalisation, competitiveness, speed and quality of information exchange means people have to cope with unprecedented levels of change. We've got to be more flexible, more creative, more adept and more responsive if we want to survive.</p> <p>Competitive advantage today comes from attracting and retaining top talent. 'It's a scarce resource,' says Higgs. 'You have to think differently about how to lead these people. The non-analytic side becomes important.' They aren't going to hang around if they don't feel comfortable.</p> <p>The costs of neglecting emotional intelligence can thus be high: increased staff turnover, low creativity, poached talent. On a personal level it can be costly, too. Goleman cites the example of a chief operating officer: powerful mind, excellent technical skills, at 45 years old perfect CEO material. On paper. He was fired by the incumbent CEO because he was 'not particularly likeable', 'brutally acerbic' and 'socially awkward'.</p> <p>But it is not simply a case of being nice. The misconception, says Sparrow, is that people confuse taking account of feelings with being soft. 'With emotional intelligence you have to know when to stand firm. It's how you do it that counts.' Imagine, he says, you've got an urgent deadline and need staff to stay behind. But one is complaining. 'If you say, \"I see you're very upset but I need you to stay and work,\" you're more likely to get them to do so because you've shown you recognise they're upset. Far less likely if you say, \"Tough shit, sit down and work.\"'</p> <p>Emotional intelligence is not restricted to work. It is applicable to relationships, parenting, marriage, education. Antidote is the campaign for emotional literacy with a particular focus on introducing emotional and skills training in schools. 'Emotional intelligence is a life skill. Developing it from childhood could transform the society we live in,' says Antidote director, James Park.</p> <p>Interest in emotional intelligence in the UK lags three to four years behind the States and is only just taking off - it was one of the keynote addresses at last year's Institute of Personnel and Development conference in Harrogate. Businesses can use it both in recruitment - drawing up EI profiles of applicants to compare with known 'star' performers - and personal and team development. So hot an issue has emotional intelligence become, that corporations - as well as individuals - are now queuing up for the plethora of new courses promising to provide participants with a high EQ.</p> <p>But Higgs warns to be suspicious of anything that offers a quick-fix solution. It is not something you can learn in a two-day seminar. There are no short cuts. It needs self-assessment, a conscious behavioural change, determination,practice and feedback. 'It's about changing culture,' says Isles. 'The test is whether your behaviour has changed. And that takes a lot longer.' It won't turn you into a touchy-feely, tree-hugger. It's far more difficult. 'It's the ability to balance hard elements with emotions,' says Higgs. 'High drive, clear focus balanced with empathy and sensitivity to the needs of others. And that's tough. To be emotionally intelligent doesn't mean you're a cuddly person.'

      "body": "<p>This last millennium brought about dramatic changes in the way we perceive the importance of food. Not so long ago, to be worried about diet would have been a luxury only afforded by the rich; nowadays thousands of nutrition books and articles appear on the internet and in bookstores - our appetite for information appears insatiable. Yet despite having the information at our fingertips, our diets are far less balanced and the prevalence of diet-related illness is rocketing. We've the highest rate of obesity in Europe, an appalling record of diet-related cancers and too much heart disease, even in youngsters.</p> <p>Why people seem unable or unwilling to eat healthily is, in part, down to confusion and some degree of apathy. We've been faced with so many 'thou shalt not' messages that the majority of us have long since switched off. However, now is a perfect time to work out how you can enjoyably eat foods that are good for you. Prioritise now and you're far more likely to feel well in the short term (spend less time fighting colds, existing rather than living) and less likely to enter old age with problems that could have been prevented or made less serious. Simple rules like eating five portions of fruit and vegetables a day can make all the difference.</p> <blockquote> <b>Five ways to eat five portions</b> <br> Roast pumpkin to make soup \u0095 Juice tangerines and grapefruit in the morning \u0095 Roast some vegetables to serve with cold meat l Have a spicy tomato juice, with or without the vodka \u0095 Eat a handful of dried dates and a few fresh walnuts as a snack </blockquote> <p><b>Water Works</b> <br> Water is the first thing we don't get enough of. Without sufficient water, our bodies are unable to glean the health-giving nutrients from the foods, to excrete the unwanted waste products and to hydrate the skin and other essential organs. Aim for two-and-a-half litres (roughly five pints) every day, sparkling or still, cold or hot. This does not include tea or coffee (or chocolate and cola) as they contain caffeine. Excess caffeine (over two to three cups a day) inhibits the absorption of essential minerals such as calcium, and increases the pancreas's capacity to secrete insulin (the hormone which breaks down sugar in the blood) making sugar and energy levels much more volatile. It can also exacerbate blood pressure and other heart conditions. Decaff can be fine, as long as you choose blends which have been treated with water and not chemicals - solvent residues are a concern. Herbal teas are best kept simple (see the box on herbal teas). Watch the fruity concoctions - they can be nothing more than an additive-enriched powder. Stagger fluid intake: aim for a glass or mug an hour; kidneys and bladder will soon adapt.</p> <blockquote> <b>Five herbal teas to try</b> <br> Camomile, mint, ginger, verveine, tilleul </blockquote> <p><b>Go with the grain</b> <br> The wholegrain/wholemeal family (cereals, breads etc) contain other crucial nutrients (zinc and B vitamins etc). This doesn't mean that white bread, pasta and rice are bad - they can provide a good source of slow-release fuel (watch their tendency to induce a short-term dose of soporific hormones, while they're being digested), calcium, as is the case with some types of white bread, and contain relatively few calories per portion.</p> <p>Choose fruit as your main sweet food: too many quickly absorbed sugars - chocolates, sweet biscuits etc - can cause tooth decay, obesity, and energy and mood fluctuations. These foods can be part of a healthy diet as long as you eat them after you have some fibre in your stomach - eat your custard tart after a meal rather than in between.</p> <p><b>Protein power</b> <br> Our gut bacteria and every other cell in our body depends on receiving a good supply of protein, fibres, vitamins and minerals, a small amount of fat and slow-release sugars. Protein wise, this involves eating 1gm per kilo of our body weight, every day - this dose equips our body with the amino-acids - the building blocks of proteins. Protein taken in excess of the target is either broken down into glucose to produce energy or stored in the body as fat. For the average adult this equates to eating a piece of lean protein about the size of a chicken breast for your main meal, plus an additional portion, half this size, in a smaller meal or snack. For a number of health reasons it's best to choose a lean source (one without noticeable fat) rather than fatty meats or products such as pies or sausages. If you don't like red meat, your diet can be balanced, but you need to take care that you include a good source of iron. If you have a tendency towards iron-deficiency anaemia (one of the most common causes of hair loss and fatigue in women) look at the box on iron-rich foods and try to include a valuable source at least three times a week. Vegetarians should have one portion of protein-rich food as a main meal and half this portion as a second meal - a portion could be two eggs, about 150g (5oz) cooked weight of pulses, 90g (3oz) nuts (be careful with children) or 225g (8oz) tofu. Since non-animal proteins don't contain the full spectrum of essential amino-acids, strict vegetarians should accompany each of their protein foods (pulses, nuts, lentils, tofu etc) with a cereal food (such as pasta, bread or rice) in both meals. This ensures the body receives the right protein balance.</p> <blockquote> <b>Five reasons to eat protein</b> <br> To build strong muscles, repair tissues, maintain an effective immune and hormonal system and help the brain receive a steady supply of serotonin and noradrenaline - aka happy hormones. </blockquote> <p><b>Eat fish</b> <br> Oily fish stand out on their own - besides being an excellent source of protein, salmon, sardines, mullet and herrings etc, contain beneficial fish oils called omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, which help prevent certain types of cancer and heart disease, reduce inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, even period pain and psoriasis.

If you're trying to keep your calorie intake in check, keeping your fat consumption down is one of the most effective measures. Fat of whatever sort - animal or vegetable - is rich in calories (with twice the calories per gram as proteins or carbohydrates). Saturated fats - butter, cream, cheese etc - can, in excess, produce unwanted LDL, aka bad cholesterol. Olive oil and other vegetable fats, however, increase HDL - the good cholesterol. If you have a high bad cholesterol level you should lean towards the vegetable fats, but if LDL is not an issue choose the fat you like and just eat a small amount of it.</p> <p>I don't recommend you eat low-fat foods, such as low-fat cheese (cut rind off soft cheese and you can decrease its fat content by up to two-thirds) or margarine - they not only taste inferior but are frequently over-processed and contain unhealthy additives and preservatives. Have full-fat food, but keep the quantity down - after all, our bodies need a small amount of proper fat to metabolise essential fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E and K. The most efficient way to enable your body to cope with fat is to match fat with fibre.</p> <p><b>Feed your bones</b> <br> Since calcium is one of the most crucial bone-building and maintaining minerals, include some dairy produce or other calcium-rich food in your daily diet. Cheese, milk and yoghurt (cow, goat or sheep) are the easiest absorbed and healthiest sources. The daily requirement is around 800mg per day for adults. To put this in perspective, 250ml (1/2 pint) cow's milk or 150g (5oz) yoghurt contains 300mg calcium.</p> <blockquote> <b>Non-dairy calcium foods</b> <br> Dark green leafy vegetables, tofu, pulses, figs and apricots, canned fish such as sardines, tahini and some nuts </blockquote> <p><b>The F-word</b> <br> Fibre swells in the presence of water and acts as a buffer to the absorption of fat.

      "bodyText": "This last millennium brought about dramatic changes in the way we perceive the importance of food. Not so long ago, to be worried about diet would have been a luxury only afforded by the rich; nowadays thousands of nutrition books and articles appear on the internet and in bookstores - our appetite for information appears insatiable. Yet despite having the information at our fingertips, our diets are far less balanced and the prevalence of diet-related illness is rocketing. We've the highest rate of obesity in Europe, an appalling record of diet-related cancers and too much heart disease, even in youngsters. Why people seem unable or unwilling to eat healthily is, in part, down to confusion and some degree of apathy. We've been faced with so many 'thou shalt not' messages that the majority of us have long since switched off. However, now is a perfect time to work out how you can enjoyably eat foods that are good for you. Prioritise now and you're far more likely to feel well in the short term (spend less time fighting colds, existing rather than living) and less likely to enter old age with problems that could have been prevented or made less serious. Simple rules like eating five portions of fruit and vegetables a day can make all the difference. Five ways to eat five portions Roast pumpkin to make soup \u0095 Juice tangerines and grapefruit in the morning \u0095 Roast some vegetables to serve with cold meat l Have a spicy tomato juice, with or without the vodka \u0095 Eat a handful of dried dates and a few fresh walnuts as a snack Water Works Water is the first thing we don't get enough of. Without sufficient water, our bodies are unable to glean the health-giving nutrients from the foods, to excrete the unwanted waste products and to hydrate the skin and other essential organs. Aim for two-and-a-half litres (roughly five pints) every day, sparkling or still, cold or hot. This does not include tea or coffee (or chocolate and cola) as they contain caffeine. Excess caffeine (over two to three cups a day) inhibits the absorption of essential minerals such as calcium, and increases the pancreas's capacity to secrete insulin (the hormone which breaks down sugar in the blood) making sugar and energy levels much more volatile. It can also exacerbate blood pressure and other heart conditions. Decaff can be fine, as long as you choose blends which have been treated with water and not chemicals - solvent residues are a concern. Herbal teas are best kept simple (see the box on herbal teas). Watch the fruity concoctions - they can be nothing more than an additive-enriched powder. Stagger fluid intake: aim for a glass or mug an hour; kidneys and bladder will soon adapt. Five herbal teas to try Camomile, mint, ginger, verveine, tilleul Go with the grain The wholegrain/wholemeal family (cereals, breads etc) contain other crucial nutrients (zinc and B vitamins etc). This doesn't mean that white bread, pasta and rice are bad - they can provide a good source of slow-release fuel (watch their tendency to induce a short-term dose of soporific hormones, while they're being digested), calcium, as is the case with some types of white bread, and contain relatively few calories per portion. Choose fruit as your main sweet food: too many quickly absorbed sugars - chocolates, sweet biscuits etc - can cause tooth decay, obesity, and energy and mood fluctuations. These foods can be part of a healthy diet as long as you eat them after you have some fibre in your stomach - eat your custard tart after a meal rather than in between. Protein power Our gut bacteria and every other cell in our body depends on receiving a good supply of protein, fibres, vitamins and minerals, a small amount of fat and slow-release sugars. Protein wise, this involves eating 1gm per kilo of our body weight, every day - this dose equips our body with the amino-acids - the building blocks of proteins. Protein taken in excess of the target is either broken down into glucose to produce energy or stored in the body as fat. For the average adult this equates to eating a piece of lean protein about the size of a chicken breast for your main meal, plus an additional portion, half this size, in a smaller meal or snack. For a number of health reasons it's best to choose a lean source (one without noticeable fat) rather than fatty meats or products such as pies or sausages.

A life coach will meet you, get   to know you, discover what areas of your life you feel dissatisfied or   confused about, then help you develop a strategy for improving them. After the initial meeting, which may take several hours, most coaching can be done by telephone - you'll have follow-up meetings only if you want them. Coaches then do what personal trainers do - they push you, encourage you, watch over you, and don't let you get away with not turning your new plans and strategies into action.

      "body": "<p>'Therapy focuses on the roots of your problems and deals, to a large extent, with your emotions,' says top British coach Eileen Mulligan. 'Coaching is far more pragmatic and goal-orientated. We don't focus on the roots of problems, but on their solutions.'<br><b> 1. Relationships</b></p> <p><b>Where are you now?</b><br>'Before I begin a one-to-one session, I ask people to do something very simple,' says Eileen. 'Write down the numbers 1-10 in a straight line. One is very unhappy, 10 is very happy. Circle the number that describes how you currently feel about your relationship.' You shouldn't think too long before you circle your number - it gives a statement of where you are to start working from.</p> <p><b>The List</b><br> Make a list. On a piece of paper, write down these headings: goals, personal strengths, immediate challenges/blocks/problems, development skills, achievements. Now start to fill them in, using these guidelines:</p> <p><b>Goals:</b> Goals are the foundation stones of life coaching. Make these something you want to gain, not something you want to get rid of. So, as we're looking at relationships, you might write something like 'to spend more time with my partner' or 'to meet a new partner'. If you write something like 'to stop getting so angry with my partner' you're describing a problem, not a goal. Resist the temptation to make goals for others, for example, 'to get my partner to pay me more attention'. Your relationship goals may well involve your partner, but you cannot think or make goals for them, only for yourself.<br><b> Personal strengths:</b> For the moment, concentrate on your strengths, not your weaknesses. Don't downgrade your strengths. If you want a good relationship, you have to believe you are worthy of one. Listing your strengths is a good way to focus on what you have to offer. You could write something like 'I always make an effort to be there for my partner' or 'people are attracted to my warm and optimistic personality'. Other strengths might include honesty, loyalty or the ability to be faithful, supportive, loving. List as many as you can think of, and prepare a list of the qualities you'd most like your partner to have.<br><b> Immediate challenges/blocks/problems:</b> This is where we get to the negative things. It's important to focus on problems that directly affect you - don't list problems that blame or involve other people. So you might write something like 'my relationships never last longer than six months' or 'I find it hard to tell my partner what my needs are'. Although you may feel that your problems are to do with another person - 'my partner works such long hours, he doesn't give me any attention' or 'my last two relationships were with people who were unfaithful to me' - it's important to focus on the problem in a way that allows you to see the part you can play in the solution. And don't forget that you can't 'make' somebody do something, so don't write 'make my partner work fewer hours'. Instead, consider the problem from another angle. Is there a way you can accommodate those long hours? Fill them with something absorbing and stimulating, so your partner's absence bothers you less. Or see the problem not as your partners always being unfaithful, but as yourself being attracted to people who treat you badly. This way, you aren't blaming somebody else, which puts the feeling outside your control. You're seeing the problem in a way that gives you control over solving it. <br><b> Development skills:</b> This is an area you can develop and improve. Listing these is a great way to focus on ways you can move forward, even in a good relationship. You are recognising that it takes two to make a partnership, and that you will take responsibility for the part you play. You might write 'learn to listen more', 'improve communication skills' or 'learn to be more independent'. <br><b> Achievements:</b> List achievements you are proud of. Even if you feel that your personal life is a disaster, there will be aspects of it, past or present, that you can feel good about. And if your relationship is basically good, having a list of achievements to fall back on really helps in the tougher times. One of my clients in an unsatisfactory relationship said, 'Well, at least I stuck it out for two years.' I persuaded her to change that to 'I've shown that I can commit to a relationship'. Other things you might write are 'I have been happily married for 10 years', 'I am not afraid to admit that I really want to be in a loving, committed relationship', 'I found the strength to leave a bad relationship and look for a good one', 'I am willing to tackle problems in my relationship' or 'I don't quit when the going gets tough'. Your achievements list is a great prompt to move you forward, because it makes you ask yourself the right questions, and to keep you positive and solution-orientated: What have I learnt from this? How have I progressed? What have I gained from the relationship? How would I do things differently next time?</p> <p><b>Know your own values</b><br> Now that you have come this far, you need to list your personal core values. We all have these, whether we're aware of them or not. When we live in conflict with our own inner values, it can lead to unhappiness, frustration and blocks. Becoming aware of your values, and prioritising them, helps you to discover what you really want. Clare's values' list, for example (see above), helped her see her relationship problems very differently, and made her reassess her goals. Start by making a list of 10 values that you feel are important to you. Some common examples include: love, security, respect, money, achievement, health, success, ambition, freedom, integrity, compassion, independence, family, children, travel, trust. Next, try to put your own values in order, from 1-10. This can be difficult, and you may need to rework your list a few times before you feel it really reflects how you think and feel. Once you've done that, look at what the list is telling you. For example, if security, family and love are high on your list, and you're having an affair, you are behaving in opposition to your values, and it will never make you happy. If freedom, independence and achievement are high on your list, you will need to be with a partner who can give you love and space.</p> <p><b>Finding the solution</b><br> At the beginning of this lesson, you listed your goals, with the immediate problems or challenges that prevent you from achieving it. Remember to keep the focus on your own place in the problem. So, if the problem is that you feel that your partner doesn't listen to you, express it as 'I need to find better ways to communicate with my partner'. If your goal is to find a soulmate but you feel you never meet anyone suitable, express it as 'I need to meet new kinds of people'. Now you can begin to find your solutions. If you keep asking yourself positive, self-focused and solution-focused questions - 'How can I ask questions in a way that my partner doesn't find threatening?', 'Where can I meet different people' - you may find a way through your problem quite quickly. But relationships often present complicated problems. If you find it difficult to see a way past the problem, try the following method.</p> <p><b>The doorway technique</b><br> Think of every possible solution there could be to this goal, whether you like the sound of it or not - putting up with the problem, finding a way not to be upset by it, leaving your partner, etc. Now close your eyes and imagine each solution written on a doorway. Then stand in front of one of the doors and walk through it. What's on the other side? If you don't like it, you can walk back through the door and try another one. Visualisation can be an unnerving but very powerful tool, which helps you to see just what you most fear from making a particular decision. Using visualisation lets you walk through the doors again and again, until it looks less threatening. Keep asking yourself the right questions. How can I make this work for me? How can I turn this situation around?</p> <p><b>Final checklist</b><br> \u0095 Acknowledge your own goals before working on joint goals. <br>\u0095 To find a solution to a problem, you have to be clear about how it affects you - the effect is something you can control. <br>\u0095 You are not trying to solve other people's problems. To achieve your goals you have to focus on the relevance a problem has to you. <br>\u0095 It's usually easier to find a problem than a goal, so work on discovering your true goals. <br>\u0095 If you feel weighed down by a problem, work on your personal strengths, development skills and achievements. This will prepare you to make the right decision. <br>\u0095 Use the 'doorway' technique when you feel really stuck.</p> <p><b>Relationship Problems</b></p> <p><b>Eileen (the coach):</b><br> Clare is a 39-year-old lawyer, with two young children. She came to see me because she was having problems in her marriage. She and her husband had been arguing a lot, often about money and work, and had reached a point where he was considering leaving. Clare was upset and angry, but clear that she did not want to separate.</p> <p>I began by asking her to fill in her 'personal values' sheet. She found this very hard to do, but when she completed the form, she listed 'learning and personal development' as her number-one value. This helped us to see her relationship problems in a new light. Clare had given up a good job to be at home with her children. While she felt it was a good decision, she was becoming increasingly frustrated that her husband wasn't progressing in his work as Clare thought he should be, and that their income was reduced.</p> <p>In fact, frustration at lack of progress and having less money is a problem for Clare, not her husband. She is projecting her own frustrations about her current lack of progress on to him, which makes him angry and resentful. Clare could acknowledge this, and set herself short, medium and long-term goals which would improve her sense of learning and development, and which would also enable her to earn more money and therefore feel valued. Very often, clients see me because of issues with one area of their lives, but the real issue turns out to be somewhere else. That's why identifying values and completing the list is so helpful.</p> <p><b>Clare (the client): </b><br> I felt very emotional at my first meeting with Eileen. But coaching isn't therapy. It doesn't allow you to examine your feelings in detail, it just sets out to understand how you got to this point and how you can move past it, in a very pragmatic way. I found filling in the values sheet hard work. My first list was all about achievement and progress, with love and security fairly low down - numbers six and seven. I didn't like that list. It wasn't the list I wanted to live my life by. I reworked it to reflect the way I think I really feel and want to be - learning and development came first, with love and family second and third. Making that list is more useful than you think - it gives you a map to guide yourself by. And realising that I was projecting my own frustrations and insecurities on to my husband was quite revelatory. I think it's true, but I hadn't connected that to us being so miserable. Most of my goals are to work on myself, and building a sense of achievement and progress into my life. I can see how life coaching can be very effective. My husband and I are getting on much better, and I feel calmer and more in control of my circumstances. I've spoken to Eileen by phone since, to evolve goals, check progress, and discuss other blocks as they come up. But, like working with a personal trainer, I worry that all the good work and resolution will go out of the window once the phone calls stop...</p>",

Now start to fill them in, using these guidelines: Goals: Goals are the foundation stones of life coaching. Make these something you want to gain, not something you want to get rid of. So, as we're looking at relationships, you might write something like 'to spend more time with my partner' or 'to meet a new partner'. If you write something like 'to stop getting so angry with my partner' you're describing a problem, not a goal. Resist the temptation to make goals for others, for example, 'to get my partner to pay me more attention'. Your relationship goals may well involve your partner, but you cannot think or make goals for them, only for yourself. Personal strengths: For the moment, concentrate on your strengths, not your weaknesses. Don't downgrade your strengths. If you want a good relationship, you have to believe you are worthy of one. Listing your strengths is a good way to focus on what you have to offer. You could write something like 'I always make an effort to be there for my partner' or 'people are attracted to my warm and optimistic personality'. Other strengths might include honesty, loyalty or the ability to be faithful, supportive, loving. List as many as you can think of, and prepare a list of the qualities you'd most like your partner to have. Immediate challenges/blocks/problems: This is where we get to the negative things. It's important to focus on problems that directly affect you - don't list problems that blame or involve other people. So you might write something like 'my relationships never last longer than six months' or 'I find it hard to tell my partner what my needs are'. Although you may feel that your problems are to do with another person - 'my partner works such long hours, he doesn't give me any attention' or 'my last two relationships were with people who were unfaithful to me' - it's important to focus on the problem in a way that allows you to see the part you can play in the solution. And don't forget that you can't 'make' somebody do something, so don't write 'make my partner work fewer hours'. Instead, consider the problem from another angle. Is there a way you can accommodate those long hours? Fill them with something absorbing and stimulating, so your partner's absence bothers you less. Or see the problem not as your partners always being unfaithful, but as yourself being attracted to people who treat you badly. This way, you aren't blaming somebody else, which puts the feeling outside your control. You're seeing the problem in a way that gives you control over solving it. Development skills: This is an area you can develop and improve. Listing these is a great way to focus on ways you can move forward, even in a good relationship. You are recognising that it takes two to make a partnership, and that you will take responsibility for the part you play. You might write 'learn to listen more', 'improve communication skills' or 'learn to be more independent'. Achievements: List achievements you are proud of. Even if you feel that your personal life is a disaster, there will be aspects of it, past or present, that you can feel good about. And if your relationship is basically good, having a list of achievements to fall back on really helps in the tougher times. One of my clients in an unsatisfactory relationship said, 'Well, at least I stuck it out for two years.' I persuaded her to change that to 'I've shown that I can commit to a relationship'. Other things you might write are 'I have been happily married for 10 years', 'I am not afraid to admit that I really want to be in a loving, committed relationship', 'I found the strength to leave a bad relationship and look for a good one', 'I am willing to tackle problems in my relationship' or 'I don't quit when the going gets tough'. Your achievements list is a great prompt to move you forward, because it makes you ask yourself the right questions, and to keep you positive and solution-orientated: What have I learnt from this? How have I progressed? What have I gained from the relationship? How would I do things differently next time? Know your own values Now that you have come this far, you need to list your personal core values. We all have these, whether we're aware of them or not. When we live in conflict with our own inner values, it can lead to unhappiness, frustration and blocks. Becoming aware of your values, and prioritising them, helps you to discover what you really want. Clare's values' list, for example (see above), helped her see her relationship problems very differently, and made her reassess her goals. Start by making a list of 10 values that you feel are important to you. Some common examples include: love, security, respect, money, achievement, health, success, ambition, freedom, integrity, compassion, independence, family, children, travel, trust. Next, try to put your own values in order, from 1-10. This can be difficult, and you may need to rework your list a few times before you feel it really reflects how you think and feel. Once you've done that, look at what the list is telling you. For example, if security, family and love are high on your list, and you're having an affair, you are behaving in opposition to your values, and it will never make you happy. If freedom, independence and achievement are high on your list, you will need to be with a partner who can give you love and space. Finding the solution At the beginning of this lesson, you listed your goals, with the immediate problems or challenges that prevent you from achieving it. Remember to keep the focus on your own place in the problem. So, if the problem is that you feel that your partner doesn't listen to you, express it as 'I need to find better ways to communicate with my partner'. If your goal is to find a soulmate but you feel you never meet anyone suitable, express it as 'I need to meet new kinds of people'. Now you can begin to find your solutions. If you keep asking yourself positive, self-focused and solution-focused questions - 'How can I ask questions in a way that my partner doesn't find threatening?', 'Where can I meet different people' - you may find a way through your problem quite quickly. But relationships often present complicated problems. If you find it difficult to see a way past the problem, try the following method. The doorway technique Think of every possible solution there could be to this goal, whether you like the sound of it or not - putting up with the problem, finding a way not to be upset by it, leaving your partner, etc. Now close your eyes and imagine each solution written on a doorway. Then stand in front of one of the doors and walk through it. What's on the other side? If you don't like it, you can walk back through the door and try another one. Visualisation can be an unnerving but very powerful tool, which helps you to see just what you most fear from making a particular decision. Using visualisation lets you walk through the doors again and again, until it looks less threatening. Keep asking yourself the right questions. How can I make this work for me? How can I turn this situation around? Final checklist \u0095 Acknowledge your own goals before working on joint goals. \u0095 To find a solution to a problem, you have to be clear about how it affects you - the effect is something you can control. \u0095 You are not trying to solve other people's problems. To achieve your goals you have to focus on the relevance a problem has to you. \u0095 It's usually easier to find a problem than a goal, so work on discovering your true goals. \u0095 If you feel weighed down by a problem, work on your personal strengths, development skills and achievements. This will prepare you to make the right decision. \u0095 Use the 'doorway' technique when you feel really stuck. Relationship Problems Eileen (the coach): Clare is a 39-year-old lawyer, with two young children. She came to see me because she was having problems in her marriage. She and her husband had been arguing a lot, often about money and work, and had reached a point where he was considering leaving. Clare was upset and angry, but clear that she did not want to separate. I began by asking her to fill in her 'personal values' sheet. She found this very hard to do, but when she completed the form, she listed 'learning and personal development' as her number-one value. This helped us to see her relationship problems in a new light. Clare had given up a good job to be at home with her children. While she felt it was a good decision, she was becoming increasingly frustrated that her husband wasn't progressing in his work as Clare thought he should be, and that their income was reduced. In fact, frustration at lack of progress and having less money is a problem for Clare, not her husband. She is projecting her own frustrations about her current lack of progress on to him, which makes him angry and resentful. Clare could acknowledge this, and set herself short, medium and long-term goals which would improve her sense of learning and development, and which would also enable her to earn more money and therefore feel valued. Very often, clients see me because of issues with one area of their lives, but the real issue turns out to be somewhere else. That's why identifying values and completing the list is so helpful. Clare (the client): I felt very emotional at my first meeting with Eileen. But coaching isn't therapy. It doesn't allow you to examine your feelings in detail, it just sets out to understand how you got to this point and how you can move past it, in a very pragmatic way. I found filling in the values sheet hard work. My first list was all about achievement and progress, with love and security fairly low down - numbers six and seven. I didn't like that list. It wasn't the list I wanted to live my life by. I reworked it to reflect the way I think I really feel and want to be - learning and development came first, with love and family second and third. Making that list is more useful than you think - it gives you a map to guide yourself by. And realising that I was projecting my own frustrations and insecurities on to my husband was quite revelatory. I think it's true, but I hadn't connected that to us being so miserable. Most of my goals are to work on myself, and building a sense of achievement and progress into my life. I can see how life coaching can be very effective. My husband and I are getting on much better, and I feel calmer and more in control of my circumstances. I've spoken to Eileen by phone since, to evolve goals, check progress, and discuss other blocks as they come up. But, like working with a personal trainer, I worry that all the good work and resolution will go out of the window once the phone calls stop...",

      "body": "<p>Mid-century, three score and 10 used to seem a 'a good innings': now five score and 10 seems more like it. What's happened? In addition to its other marvels (splitting the atom, transplanting a beating human heart, and cracking our genetic code), the 20th century is likely to be remembered for having the biggest hike in life expectancy in recorded history, rising from 52 to 79 for women and from 49 to 74 for men - a leap of nearly 50 per cent. What's more, in every decade of the last century, the average life span rose by about two years - a trend that shows no signs of abating.</p> <p>What are we doing with all these extra years? All the indications are that we are living not just longer but better. With unprecedented numbers of fit, healthy people now hitting 70, 80, and even 90, it's becoming clear that gloomy predictions of a greying population, beset by ever increasing and expensive degenerative diseases, have been overdone.</p> <p>In fact, over the last 10 years surveys from the US have repeatedly shown that the period of illness and infirmity we call 'old age' is actually shortening: in the short space of just seven years (1982 to 1989), for example, the probability of an 85-year-old remaining free from disabilities rose by nearly 30 per cent.</p> <p>Already, there is an ever-growing expansion of what we think of as 'youth' and a postponement of 'old age', with the middle years appearing to expand indefinitely. Many of today's octogenarians are enjoying a quality of life that used to be the prerogative of the newly retired - travelling to new destinations, acquiring new skills, taking up new sports, interests and studies, starting or continuing to run businesses and actively looking forward to each new day. If our own definition of old age is a constantly moving target, it's not just because it always jumps on 10 years as we ourselves get older. It's also because what it means to reach 60, 70, 80 or even 90 is itself undergoing a dramatic attitude shift.</p> <p>The challenge in front of all of us now is to age as successfully as we can. It's becoming clear that there are two sorts of ageing - chronological and biological, and while we can't change our chronological age, we can do a lot to slow down biological ageing by adopting the 110 lifestyle and attitude changes listed here.</p> <p><b>Heredity/Luck</b><br> Have one, or preferably two, long-lived parents (85+).<br> Be a well-educated, well-off westerner. Undemocratic but true: wealth buys health.<br> Have access to the best health care and make use of it.<br> Get to grips with your family history. Find out what your close relations died of: cancer, heart disease, stroke, and ask your doctor about screening tests for these conditions.</p> <p><b>Lifestyle</b><br> Never take up smoking, or give it up now, using medical aids, such as nicotine gum, to help you.<br> Wear sunscreen - SPF of 15 or more - every day in the summer.<br> Use condoms or barrier method contraception if not in a monogamous relationship to reduce susceptibility to STDs.<br> Walk tall. Good posture is a common Super-young characteristic: unlearn slouching tendencies via yoga, Pilates or the Alexander Technique.<br> Keep an eye on your weight - know your Body Mass Index and keep it in the low 20s.<br> Once weight has stabilised, keep it steady - no fluctuations of more than seven pounds either way.<br> Watch your waist-to-hip ratio - apple-type fat that barrels around the middle is a big risk factor for several serious diseases, while pear-type fat is not: your waist should be 0.7 or less of your hip measurement for women, 0.85 for men.<br> Sleep needs reduce with age, and may be as little as three or four hours after age 65; don't let bouts of insomnia worry you and certainly don't take sleeping pills other than for short-term help at crisis points.<br> Try not to have a caffeine-containing drink less than four hours before bedtime.<br> Floss teeth daily and keep regular dental hygiene appointments: tooth/gum bacteria have been linked to heart disease and serious digestive disorders.<br> Keep your anxiety level down - it interferes with memory, mental functioning and disables the immune system.</p> <p><b>Nutrition</b><br> Train yourself to eat fewer calories - cut out snacks, eat smaller quantities, chew slowly, stop when full and have a modest meal at the end of the day.<br> Move towards a more plant-based diet - non meat-eaters really do live longer.<br> Have at least five helpings of fruit/ vegetables daily, varying the colours as much as possible to get the full spectrum of health-giving antioxidants.<br> Eat vegetables raw or very lightly cooked to conserve valuable vitamins and include a salad with your meal at least once a day.<br> Eat three to four helpings of wholegrains a day for B-complex vitamins - important to heart health.<br> Buy a juicer and have an 240ml (8floz) glass of both fruit and vegetable juice every day.<br> Rebalance your system with fortnightly one- or two-day vegetable juice fasts.<br> Eat organic produce and free-range meat/ fish where possible.<br> Cut down on foods that are high in saturated fat.<br> Keep added sugar to a minimum.<br> Choose foods as close as possible to their natural state.<br> Eat oily fish three times a week for health-giving omega-3 fatty acids that will especially benefit the heart and circulation - salmon, tuna, mackerel, halibut, herring.<br> Limit red meat to once or twice a week.<br> Cook with monounsaturated rather than polyunsaturated fat (ie, olive oil rather than safflower and sunflower) and use hazelnut and walnut oils in dressings.<br> Vary your diet: explore different ethnic cuisines and continually introduce novelty.<br> Train yourself to look on food as a source of pleasure rather than guilt or anxiety.<br> Don't rely on pills to make good any deficiencies in your diet but bolster your defences with a daily multivitamin supplement - that includes the antioxidant vitamins C (up to 500mg) and E (400-800 ius) and the B-complex vitamins, including folic acid (400 ug), B6 (up to 100mg) and B12 (up to 100mcg).</p> <p><b>Habits</b><br> Cut back on alcohol if you drink every day or exceed 27 units a week (21 for women).<br> Avoid binge drinking (5 units or more).<br> Have at least one alcohol-free day a week.<br> Enjoy a guilt-free glass or two of wine in the evening - red wine is especially good.<br> Keep spirits and beers as occasional treats.<br> Limit caffeine to two cups of coffee/tea a day.<br> Explore non-caffeine alternatives: chicory, herb and (especially) antioxidant-rich green teas and tinctures.<br> Drink 2 1/2 litres of water a day.<br> Avoid regular laxative use; increase the amount of fibre you eat and activity you take until your system regularises itself.<br> Learn the art of relaxation, via meditation mantra, taught techniques, breathing methods or autogenic training, and put it to good use every day.<br></p> <p><b>Activity</b><br> Get moving immediately: if not taking any other form of exercise, just getting out for a brisk walk for at least 30 minutes a day could cut your risk of a heart attack by a third.<br> Make it easier by implementing a policy of walking distances of less than a mile and leaving the car behind, while moving at a brisker pace than you're accustomed to.<br> Get a dog (or find a neighbour's one) who needs walking to accompany you<br> Consider investing in a heart monitor to learn how your heart responds to, and recovers from, exertion.<br> Try to have aerobic sessions to condition heart and lungs three times a week for 20-40 minutes and keep it up for the rest of your healthy life.<br> If turned off by vigorous exercise such as running, jogging or biking, substitute a mixture of brisk walking and swimming.<br> For choice, select a weight-bearing exercise that will stimulate bone turnover and keep the skeleton strong: walking, jogging, skipping, rebounding, cycling, low-impact aerobics and ski-machines and Stairmaster-type climbers all qualify.<br> Use stairs rather than lifts to give an additionally beneficial jolt to the bones.<br> Try to include some strength work to maintain muscle mass - especially important for women, who are more likely to become prematurely enfeebled, with dire consequences for both balance and mobility.<br> Embark on a specific strength-training programme - studies at Tufts University in Boston show that year-long participation reverses the course of ageing by 15 to 20 years in elderly women.<br> Include a yoga-type stretching component to keep joints supple through the full range of movement.</p> <p><b>Screening</b><br> Be vigilant: report any untoward change in health and body function to your doctor.<br> Regularly examine your body for new or changed moles and ask a relative, friend or practice nurse to check you over too.<br> Have blood pressure checks at least once every two years.<br> Have cholesterol/homocysteine checks for arterial and heart health from time to time and adjust diet if indicated.<br> lPay for one-off sigmoidoscopy at 50 to 55 to check for pre-malignant growths, known as polyps, on the colon, and be advised about further screens if/as necessary.<br> Ask your doctor about supplementing this with regular foecal occult blood tests to detect hidden blood in bowel movements - a possible sign of pre-malignant activity.<br> Report persisting changes in bowel habit.<br> Have flu vaccinations over age 65.<br> Have regular glaucoma eye checks every two years from age 40 (35 if you've a family history of the condition).</p> <p><b>Women's health</b><br> Examine your breasts at least once a month - ask your doctor/ nurse to show you how.<br> Take up invitations for mammography - issued three-yearly between ages 50 and 65.<br> Ask for screening to be continued after age 65. Although the invitations will cease, there is provision.<br> Have regular smears and, if your health authority only offers them five-yearly, consider paying for interim smear tests privately to keep screening intervals optimal.<br> Keep up to speed on contraception: the Pill offers valuable protection against ovarian cancer.<br> Never diet to a point where menstruation stops. It could have serious consequences for bone and heart health.<br> See your doctor if you've pain or bloating in the abdomen, pain or bleeding during sex or post-menopausal bleeding.<br> Consider hormone replacement at menopause - now shown to benefit brain as well as bones and, probably, heart - though these pluses must be balanced against extra risk of breast cancer.<br> Consider having a bone scan (either state-of-the-art DEXA or cheaper heel ultrasound) to get indication of bone density at menopause.<br> Consider taking extra calcium, best combined with magnesium for optimum absorption at a ratio of 2:1 calcium to magnesium.<br> If deciding against HRT, consider taking phyto-oestrogens and get into the habit of adding tofu, soya and wheatgerm to your diet. It could afford a natural protection against breast cancer and, possibly, thinning bones.<br> Exercise your pelvic floor whenever you pass water; if muscles are weak, try toning them with cones.<br></p> <p><b>Men's health</b><br> Men see their doctor much less often than women: arrange to have a regular health check at least every two years.<br> Examine your testicles regularly for lumps.<br> Be aware of signs and symptoms of prostate cancer, the commonest and most treatable cancer in men provided it is caught early.<br> Ask your doctor about having a PSA test to help flag a possible early-stage tumour.<br> Drink a daily glass of tomato juice: men who have more than 10 servings of tomato a week, whether raw and fresh or even on pizza, have significantly lower rates of prostate cancer, possibly due to the antioxidant lycopene which gives the tomato its red colour.</p> <p><b>Medical</b><br> Wise up. Information is power, especially as we age.<br> Be aware of symptoms of high blood pressure and late-life diabetes - both conditions need active management if not to lead on to more serious problems.<br> Avoid illicit drugs - even a benign weed like marijuana wrecks the memory.<br> Check all prescription drugs are really necessary (especially repeats). Iatrogenic (medicine-induced) illness is a big cause of ill health in later life.<br> For any long-term chronic problems explore alternatives, such as homeopathy, acupuncture and dietary manipulation, that could enable you to cut out or cut down on medication.</p> <p><b>Safety</b><br> Always wear a seat belt.<br> Never drive with any amount of alcohol in your blood, or get into a car where you know the driver has been drinking.<br> Use a hands-free phone system to make calls when driving, or pull over before telephoning.</p> <p><b>Social</b><br> Never stop networking: renew old contacts and forge new ones.<br> Mix with a broad spectrum of people of all ages, especially younger ones.<br> Be open to new romantic and sexual opportunities.</p> <p><b>Attitudes</b><br> Foster optimism, a common Super-young characteristic, by refusing to tolerate prolonged boredom or unhappiness.<br> Challenge other people's assumptions that you can't do something 'at your age' - especially if it's sex - lively libidos are a common characteristic of the Super-young.<br> Remain alert to your own false assumptions, too, or you may to readily impose unnecessary limitations on yourself.<br> Plan for your retirement - so you don't get ambushed by those empty hours opening up in front of you.<br> Don't let anyone persuade you that any aspect of ill health, from chronic pain to depression, is 'to be expected' in later life. It's not. Get it checked out and/or ask for a second opinion.<br> Indulge your sense of humour whenever and wherever you can.</p> <p><b>Intellect</b><br> Junk junk TV - only watch programmes that stimulate and enrich you.<br> Keep up to speed with advances in technology.<br> Stretch your mind - learning offsets decreases in brain capacity with age, so take up a musical instrument, learn a language, subscribe to a specialist journal, or embark on an adult education course.<br> Don't get mentally lazy: take regular exercise by working out sums in your head, memorising phone numbers and poems, doing crosswords, playing chess or bridge.<br> Find a hobby or interest that really absorbs you and get immersed.</p> <p><b>Spirit</b><br> Find a constructive way of helping others.<br> Maintain interest in spirituality and a belief, however free-floating, of a force outside yourself while remaining sceptical of eternal life on earth.</p> <p><b>Hope or hype? The new elixirs of youth</b></p> <p>The latest 'miracle treatments' in the battle against ageing are focusing on genes, enzymes and hormones - particularly those that peak in early adulthood and then slowly decline. Whether these are a cause of the ageing process or merely an effect is too soon to say, but these are the 'wonder drugs' currently causing the most excitement - and controversy:</p> <p>Melatonin - the world's only effective answer to jet lag, melatonin works by resetting the body's diurnal clock. But whether it can rewind time itself is much less certain. Melatonin is released by the pineal gland in response to the external cues of darkness and daylight. It is a weak antioxidant but not sufficiently strong to produce the miraculous effects ascribed to it. Because it is a brain hormone with very general effects on the body, physicians recommend caution. <br>Status: unproven.</p> <p>Growth hormone - is secreted in short, sharp bursts on a daily pattern. Levels peak in childhood and then slowly decline, falling off by about 30 per cent after age 55. As well as promoting growth in childhood and adolescence, the hormone builds muscle mass, strength and vigour. Promises of increases in youthful strength and potency must be offset against a risk of dangerously raised blood pressure, early death from cardiovascular disease and cancer. The verdict of endocrinologists? You're safer stoking up your own levels with vigorous exercise, like sex, which stimulates the release of the hormone. <br>Status: interesting.</p> <p>DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone) is a close chemical cousin of testosterone and oestrogen. Levels peak in the mid-20s, when it is the most abundant of all the circulating hormones, and then plummet by 80 per cent by the mid-70s. DHEA is claimed to make you live longer, be stronger and sexier, though no one can work out exactly what it does. Encouraging reports that raising DHEA levels may protect men (but not women) against heart disease, preserve or build lean body tissue and improve mood and wellbeing. Side-effects may include heart rhythm disturbance, prostate cancer and masculinising effects on women. <br>Status: needs more research.</p> <p><b>Starve and Survive</b></p> <p>Animal studies show the only non-genetic way to increase lifespan is by restricting their food. Rats and mice fed between 60-70 per cent fewer calories live up to 40 per cent longer than those allowed to eat their fill - lifespan gains which are equivalent to 30 or 40 more human years. What's more, they stay energetic for longer, have stronger immune systems, better memories and reduced rates of cancer. The principles of caloric restriction have held true for every animal species tested so far, including monkeys.</p> <p>People hesitate to recommend the same rules for humans, partly because the largest gains are seen when food supplies are restricted soon after weaning (an unthinkable strategy on young children), and partly because we have an epidemic of eating disorders among vulnerable adolescents, who need little encouragement to eat even less. But it's likely that caloric restriction would extend life, especially if the diet is sufficiently nutrient-rich. The Japanese inhabitants of Okinawa, an island far to the south of Japan, who consume 80 per cent of the calorific intake of their fellow nationals on the mainland, regularly live into extreme old age, having the highest population of centenarians anywhere on the globe - four times as many as the rest of Japan, who are already the world-record holders for longevity.</p> <p><b>Survival of the sexiest</b></p> <p>In his 18-year-long study, the Super-young project, at the Royal Edinburgh Hospital, Dr David Weeks concluded that 'eventful love lives' are a hallmark of individuals who look and feel at least 10 years younger than their chronological age. Many reported that they were not only sexually active but continuing to form new romantic attachments into their 80s and 90s.</p> <p>'Compared with the rest of us,' he writes in Secrets of the Superyoung (published in the US by Villard, $23.95), 'the Superyoung have more, and more satisfying, romantic relationships over the course of a lifetime - and lots of great sex in the context of mature, mutually shared erotic unions.' His claim that revving up your sex life will lop four to seven years off your biological age is supported by research elsewhere suggesting that sex and orgasm have independent physiological effects on the brain and the body and stimulate the immune system's T3 lymphocytes which are known to fight infection.</p>",

It's also because what it means to reach 60, 70, 80 or even 90 is itself undergoing a dramatic attitude shift. The challenge in front of all of us now is to age as successfully as we can. It's becoming clear that there are two sorts of ageing - chronological and biological, and while we can't change our chronological age, we can do a lot to slow down biological ageing by adopting the 110 lifestyle and attitude changes listed here. Heredity/Luck Have one, or preferably two, long-lived parents (85+). Be a well-educated, well-off westerner. Undemocratic but true: wealth buys health. Have access to the best health care and make use of it. Get to grips with your family history. Find out what your close relations died of: cancer, heart disease, stroke, and ask your doctor about screening tests for these conditions. Lifestyle Never take up smoking, or give it up now, using medical aids, such as nicotine gum, to help you. Wear sunscreen - SPF of 15 or more - every day in the summer. Use condoms or barrier method contraception if not in a monogamous relationship to reduce susceptibility to STDs. Walk tall. Good posture is a common Super-young characteristic: unlearn slouching tendencies via yoga, Pilates or the Alexander Technique. Keep an eye on your weight - know your Body Mass Index and keep it in the low 20s. Once weight has stabilised, keep it steady - no fluctuations of more than seven pounds either way. Watch your waist-to-hip ratio - apple-type fat that barrels around the middle is a big risk factor for several serious diseases, while pear-type fat is not: your waist should be 0.7 or less of your hip measurement for women, 0.85 for men. Sleep needs reduce with age, and may be as little as three or four hours after age 65; don't let bouts of insomnia worry you and certainly don't take sleeping pills other than for short-term help at crisis points. Try not to have a caffeine-containing drink less than four hours before bedtime. Floss teeth daily and keep regular dental hygiene appointments: tooth/gum bacteria have been linked to heart disease and serious digestive disorders. Keep your anxiety level down - it interferes with memory, mental functioning and disables the immune system. Nutrition Train yourself to eat fewer calories - cut out snacks, eat smaller quantities, chew slowly, stop when full and have a modest meal at the end of the day. Move towards a more plant-based diet - non meat-eaters really do live longer. Have at least five helpings of fruit/ vegetables daily, varying the colours as much as possible to get the full spectrum of health-giving antioxidants. Eat vegetables raw or very lightly cooked to conserve valuable vitamins and include a salad with your meal at least once a day. Eat three to four helpings of wholegrains a day for B-complex vitamins - important to heart health. Buy a juicer and have an 240ml (8floz) glass of both fruit and vegetable juice every day. Rebalance your system with fortnightly one- or two-day vegetable juice fasts. Eat organic produce and free-range meat/ fish where possible. Cut down on foods that are high in saturated fat. Keep added sugar to a minimum. Choose foods as close as possible to their natural state. Eat oily fish three times a week for health-giving omega-3 fatty acids that will especially benefit the heart and circulation - salmon, tuna, mackerel, halibut, herring. Limit red meat to once or twice a week. Cook with monounsaturated rather than polyunsaturated fat (ie, olive oil rather than safflower and sunflower) and use hazelnut and walnut oils in dressings. Vary your diet: explore different ethnic cuisines and continually introduce novelty. Train yourself to look on food as a source of pleasure rather than guilt or anxiety. Don't rely on pills to make good any deficiencies in your diet but bolster your defences with a daily multivitamin supplement - that includes the antioxidant vitamins C (up to 500mg) and E (400-800 ius) and the B-complex vitamins, including folic acid (400 ug), B6 (up to 100mg) and B12 (up to 100mcg). Habits Cut back on alcohol if you drink every day or exceed 27 units a week (21 for women). Avoid binge drinking (5 units or more). Have at least one alcohol-free day a week. Enjoy a guilt-free glass or two of wine in the evening - red wine is especially good. Keep spirits and beers as occasional treats. Limit caffeine to two cups of coffee/tea a day. Explore non-caffeine alternatives: chicory, herb and (especially) antioxidant-rich green teas and tinctures. Drink 2 1/2 litres of water a day. Avoid regular laxative use; increase the amount of fibre you eat and activity you take until your system regularises itself. Learn the art of relaxation, via meditation mantra, taught techniques, breathing methods or autogenic training, and put it to good use every day. Activity Get moving immediately: if not taking any other form of exercise, just getting out for a brisk walk for at least 30 minutes a day could cut your risk of a heart attack by a third. Make it easier by implementing a policy of walking distances of less than a mile and leaving the car behind, while moving at a brisker pace than you're accustomed to. Get a dog (or find a neighbour's one) who needs walking to accompany you Consider investing in a heart monitor to learn how your heart responds to, and recovers from, exertion. Try to have aerobic sessions to condition heart and lungs three times a week for 20-40 minutes and keep it up for the rest of your healthy life. If turned off by vigorous exercise such as running, jogging or biking, substitute a mixture of brisk walking and swimming. For choice, select a weight-bearing exercise that will stimulate bone turnover and keep the skeleton strong: walking, jogging, skipping, rebounding, cycling, low-impact aerobics and ski-machines and Stairmaster-type climbers all qualify. Use stairs rather than lifts to give an additionally beneficial jolt to the bones. Try to include some strength work to maintain muscle mass - especially important for women, who are more likely to become prematurely enfeebled, with dire consequences for both balance and mobility. Embark on a specific strength-training programme - studies at Tufts University in Boston show that year-long participation reverses the course of ageing by 15 to 20 years in elderly women. Include a yoga-type stretching component to keep joints supple through the full range of movement. Screening Be vigilant: report any untoward change in health and body function to your doctor. Regularly examine your body for new or changed moles and ask a relative, friend or practice nurse to check you over too. Have blood pressure checks at least once every two years. Have cholesterol/homocysteine checks for arterial and heart health from time to time and adjust diet if indicated. lPay for one-off sigmoidoscopy at 50 to 55 to check for pre-malignant growths, known as polyps, on the colon, and be advised about further screens if/as necessary. Ask your doctor about supplementing this with regular foecal occult blood tests to detect hidden blood in bowel movements - a possible sign of pre-malignant activity. Report persisting changes in bowel habit. Have flu vaccinations over age 65. Have regular glaucoma eye checks every two years from age 40 (35 if you've a family history of the condition). Women's health Examine your breasts at least once a month - ask your doctor/ nurse to show you how. Take up invitations for mammography - issued three-yearly between ages 50 and 65. Ask for screening to be continued after age 65. Although the invitations will cease, there is provision. Have regular smears and, if your health authority only offers them five-yearly, consider paying for interim smear tests privately to keep screening intervals optimal. Keep up to speed on contraception: the Pill offers valuable protection against ovarian cancer. Never diet to a point where menstruation stops. It could have serious consequences for bone and heart health. See your doctor if you've pain or bloating in the abdomen, pain or bleeding during sex or post-menopausal bleeding. Consider hormone replacement at menopause - now shown to benefit brain as well as bones and, probably, heart - though these pluses must be balanced against extra risk of breast cancer. Consider having a bone scan (either state-of-the-art DEXA or cheaper heel ultrasound) to get indication of bone density at menopause. Consider taking extra calcium, best combined with magnesium for optimum absorption at a ratio of 2:1 calcium to magnesium. If deciding against HRT, consider taking phyto-oestrogens and get into the habit of adding tofu, soya and wheatgerm to your diet. It could afford a natural protection against breast cancer and, possibly, thinning bones. Exercise your pelvic floor whenever you pass water; if muscles are weak, try toning them with cones. Men's health Men see their doctor much less often than women: arrange to have a regular health check at least every two years. Examine your testicles regularly for lumps. Be aware of signs and symptoms of prostate cancer, the commonest and most treatable cancer in men provided it is caught early. Ask your doctor about having a PSA test to help flag a possible early-stage tumour. Drink a daily glass of tomato juice: men who have more than 10 servings of tomato a week, whether raw and fresh or even on pizza, have significantly lower rates of prostate cancer, possibly due to the antioxidant lycopene which gives the tomato its red colour. Medical Wise up. Information is power, especially as we age. Be aware of symptoms of high blood pressure and late-life diabetes - both conditions need active management if not to lead on to more serious problems. Avoid illicit drugs - even a benign weed like marijuana wrecks the memory. Check all prescription drugs are really necessary (especially repeats). Iatrogenic (medicine-induced) illness is a big cause of ill health in later life. For any long-term chronic problems explore alternatives, such as homeopathy, acupuncture and dietary manipulation, that could enable you to cut out or cut down on medication. Safety Always wear a seat belt. Never drive with any amount of alcohol in your blood, or get into a car where you know the driver has been drinking. Use a hands-free phone system to make calls when driving, or pull over before telephoning. Social Never stop networking: renew old contacts and forge new ones. Mix with a broad spectrum of people of all ages, especially younger ones. Be open to new romantic and sexual opportunities. Attitudes Foster optimism, a common Super-young characteristic, by refusing to tolerate prolonged boredom or unhappiness. Challenge other people's assumptions that you can't do something 'at your age' - especially if it's sex - lively libidos are a common characteristic of the Super-young. Remain alert to your own false assumptions, too, or you may to readily impose unnecessary limitations on yourself. Plan for your retirement - so you don't get ambushed by those empty hours opening up in front of you. Don't let anyone persuade you that any aspect of ill health, from chronic pain to depression, is 'to be expected' in later life. It's not. Get it checked out and/or ask for a second opinion. Indulge your sense of humour whenever and wherever you can. Intellect Junk junk TV - only watch programmes that stimulate and enrich you. Keep up to speed with advances in technology. Stretch your mind - learning offsets decreases in brain capacity with age, so take up a musical instrument, learn a language, subscribe to a specialist journal, or embark on an adult education course. Don't get mentally lazy: take regular exercise by working out sums in your head, memorising phone numbers and poems, doing crosswords, playing chess or bridge. Find a hobby or interest that really absorbs you and get immersed. Spirit Find a constructive way of helping others. Maintain interest in spirituality and a belief, however free-floating, of a force outside yourself while remaining sceptical of eternal life on earth. Hope or hype? The new elixirs of youth The latest 'miracle treatments' in the battle against ageing are focusing on genes, enzymes and hormones - particularly those that peak in early adulthood and then slowly decline. Whether these are a cause of the ageing process or merely an effect is too soon to say, but these are the 'wonder drugs' currently causing the most excitement - and controversy: Melatonin - the world's only effective answer to jet lag, melatonin works by resetting the body's diurnal clock. But whether it can rewind time itself is much less certain. Melatonin is released by the pineal gland in response to the external cues of darkness and daylight. It is a weak antioxidant but not sufficiently strong to produce the miraculous effects ascribed to it. Because it is a brain hormone with very general effects on the body, physicians recommend caution. Status: unproven. Growth hormone - is secreted in short, sharp bursts on a daily pattern. Levels peak in childhood and then slowly decline, falling off by about 30 per cent after age 55. As well as promoting growth in childhood and adolescence, the hormone builds muscle mass, strength and vigour. Promises of increases in youthful strength and potency must be offset against a risk of dangerously raised blood pressure, early death from cardiovascular disease and cancer. The verdict of endocrinologists? You're safer stoking up your own levels with vigorous exercise, like sex, which stimulates the release of the hormone. Status: interesting. DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone) is a close chemical cousin of testosterone and oestrogen. Levels peak in the mid-20s, when it is the most abundant of all the circulating hormones, and then plummet by 80 per cent by the mid-70s. DHEA is claimed to make you live longer, be stronger and sexier, though no one can work out exactly what it does. Encouraging reports that raising DHEA levels may protect men (but not women) against heart disease, preserve or build lean body tissue and improve mood and wellbeing. Side-effects may include heart rhythm disturbance, prostate cancer and masculinising effects on women. Status: needs more research. Starve and Survive Animal studies show the only non-genetic way to increase lifespan is by restricting their food. Rats and mice fed between 60-70 per cent fewer calories live up to 40 per cent longer than those allowed to eat their fill - lifespan gains which are equivalent to 30 or 40 more human years. What's more, they stay energetic for longer, have stronger immune systems, better memories and reduced rates of cancer. The principles of caloric restriction have held true for every animal species tested so far, including monkeys. People hesitate to recommend the same rules for humans, partly because the largest gains are seen when food supplies are restricted soon after weaning (an unthinkable strategy on young children), and partly because we have an epidemic of eating disorders among vulnerable adolescents, who need little encouragement to eat even less. But it's likely that caloric restriction would extend life, especially if the diet is sufficiently nutrient-rich. The Japanese inhabitants of Okinawa, an island far to the south of Japan, who consume 80 per cent of the calorific intake of their fellow nationals on the mainland, regularly live into extreme old age, having the highest population of centenarians anywhere on the globe - four times as many as the rest of Japan, who are already the world-record holders for longevity. Survival of the sexiest In his 18-year-long study, the Super-young project, at the Royal Edinburgh Hospital, Dr David Weeks concluded that 'eventful love lives' are a hallmark of individuals who look and feel at least 10 years younger than their chronological age. Many reported that they were not only sexually active but continuing to form new romantic attachments into their 80s and 90s. 'Compared with the rest of us,' he writes in Secrets of the Superyoung (published in the US by Villard, $23.95), 'the Superyoung have more, and more satisfying, romantic relationships over the course of a lifetime - and lots of great sex in the context of mature, mutually shared erotic unions.' His claim that revving up your sex life will lop four to seven years off your biological age is supported by research elsewhere suggesting that sex and orgasm have independent physiological effects on the brain and the body and stimulate the immune system's T3 lymphocytes which are known to fight infection.",

      "body": "<p><strong>White Teeth</strong><br>Zadie Smith<br>Hamish Hamilton, \u00a312.99, pp462</p> <p>It is more than 300 years since Daniel Defoe, in his poem 'The True-born Englishman' first recognised the essentially heterogeneous condition of the nation. He described the English as a people composed of mongrelised 'mixtures', identifying the Scot, Pict and Dane among many other constituent elements. Should Defoe have been able to glance at modern, postcolonial Britain, he would have to add the West Indian, the Indian and the African. It is precisely this helpless heterogeneity that Zadie Smith recognises and celebrates in this restless and wonderfully poised first novel, White Teeth.</p> <p>The novel follows the fortunes of the families of two best friends: Archie Jones, a white, working-class man who works in a mail-order delivery firm, and who is married for a second time to a Jamaican woman, Clara, and Samad Iqbal, a Bangladeshi who is married to Alansa, and who works in a restaurant. As the hinge of generation turns, their children begin to complicate the lives of these two men. Samad has twin boys, Magid and Millat, and Archie has a daughter, Irie. Naturally enough, the children become friends and they create a dazzlingly complex world of cross-cultural fusion in modern-day London. </p> <p>Samad is concerned at the way in which his sons are growing up in Britain (Magid has taken to being addressed as 'Mark Smith'), so he dispatches Magid back 'home' to be brought up by relatives. After Magid's departure, Millat Iqbal and Irie Jones befriend a boy called Joshua and a third family, the Chalfens, take centre stage. Marcus Chalfen, an eccentric scientist and university lecturer, and his wife Joyce, a mother and author of The Inner Life of Houseplants, have four children, including their eldest, Joshua. </p> <p>The Chalfens are a liberal, pseudo-Marxist, white middle-class family who, as one might expect, welcome this 'exciting' rush of hybridity into their lives. Eventually, Marcus becomes penpals with the orientally exiled Magid, and on Magid's return to Britain it is Marcus who meets him at Heathrow and begins to make plans for this now level-headed, polite young man to study law. Meanwhile, Millat has renounced 'white birds' and joined 'the Cricklewood branch of the Keepers of the Eternal and Victorious Islamic Nation', which Irie points out have an 'acronym problem' - Kevin. </p> <p>Samad and Archie 'observe' events from the vantage point of their retreat, O'Connell's Caf\u00e9 on the Finchley Road, a place run by Abdul-Mickey, the son of an immigrant named Ali. All five sons were named Abdul, but Ali took the precaution of attaching an English name as a gesture to the clarity demanded by the new country. O'Connell's offers Samad and Archie a place from which they can view the interaction between the various families as the novel ranges back and forth in both contemporary and historical time. This multi-layered, deeply-plotted novel resists easy categorisation, which is precisely the author's point. </p> <p>Britain has perennially sought to define herself and her character by defining others. Naturally enough, the country finds herself in great difficulty when presented with those who seem keen to resist definition. These 'in-betweens', these Abdul-Mickeys (or his brother Abdul-Colin), these working-class white men, like Archie, who marry Jamaican women 20 years their junior, these non-believing 'Muslims' such as Millat, these 'white birds' who go weak at the knees for people such as Magid - such people present Britain with a problem of categorisation.</p> <p>For those of a colonial mindset, this swirling postcolonial world is blurring distinctions and challenging received wisdoms at an alarming rate. It is uncomfortably clear to those of the 'old school' that the hitherto familiar cultural signifiers of belonging are no longer the preserve of one group to the exclusion of another. One only needs to overhear a conversation on practically any London street corner: </p> <p> 'For your information,' snapped Irie, moving the nut out of Millat's reach, 'old people like coconuts. They can use the milk for their tea.' </p> <p>Irie pressed on in the face of Millat's retching. 'And I got some crusty French bread and some cheese-singlets and some apples - ' </p> <p>'We got apples, you chief,' cut in Millat, 'chief', for some inexplicable reason hidden in the etymology of north London slang, meaning fool, arse, wanker, a loser of the most colossal proportions. </p> <p>'Well, I got some more and better apples, akchully, and some Kendal mint cake and some ackee and saltfish.' </p> <p>'I hate ackee and saltfish.' </p> <p> However, it is not only those of a colonial mindset who must open themselves to change. When 'nature' visits Britain in October 1987, in the form of a hurricane, the Iqbals' world is shaken up. While Samad and Millat hurry to flee the house, Alansa sits stubbornly on the sofa confident that nothing will happen because 'Mr Fish', the BBC weatherman, has assured 'her' that all will be fine. When she relents, and gets in the car and drives from the house with 110mph winds howling, she confesses that her world has changed. </p> <p>She is of an immigrant generation that expected to encounter a benign Britain; a 'civilised' Britain, as characterised by BBC announcers in dinner-jackets, crumpets for tea and the comforting thwack of leather on willow. Quite probably a Britain that never existed, but nonetheless - in her mind - a more reliable Britain than that to which she is currently being exposed: </p> <p> 'England, this is meant to be! I moved to England so I wouldn't have to do this. Never again will I trust that Mr Crab.' </p> <p>'Amma, it's Mr Fish.' </p> <p>'From now on, he's Mr Crab to me,' snapped Alansa with a dark look. 'BBC or no BBC.' </p> <p> The depiction of the dysfunctional Chalfen family, while often funny, finally seems too cartoon-like. Marcus and Joyce Chalfen tolerate the foul-mouthed Millat, who rolls joints at their table, drinks their alcohol and generally calls the shots around their house. </p> <p> 'Oh, Millat, don't smoke that stuff. Every time we see you these days you're smoking. It upsets Oscar so much. He's not that young and he understands more than you think. He understands about marijuana.' </p> <p>'What's mary wana?' asked Oscar. </p> <p>'You know what it is, Oscar. It's what makes Millat all horrible, like we were talking about today, and it's what kills the little brain cells he has.' </p> <p>'Get off my fucking back, Joyce.' </p> <p> It is frustrating not to have a more 'substantial' white family at the heart of the novel, for Irie, Millat and Magid are treated by the Chalfens with a degree of patronage that is unsurprising. Their son, Joshua, has a more complicated response to the situation, for Irie is the object of his desire. However, his two-dimensional parents do little more than enliven the more farcical elements of the narrative. </p> <p>There is nothing farcical about the pain of wanting to belong. In this respect, White Teeth is full of false smiles and contrived faces, masks that are repeatedly donned in order to better hide the pain. The 'mongrel' nation that is Britain is still struggling to find a way to stare into the mirror and accept the ebb and flow of history that has produced this fortuitously diverse condition and its concomitant pain. </p> <p>Zadie Smith's first novel is an audaciously assured contribution to this process of staring into the mirror. Her narrator is deeply self-conscious, so much so that one can almost hear the crisp echo of Salman Rushdie's footsteps. However, her wit, her breadth of vision and her ambition are of her own making. The plot is rich, at times dizzyingly so, but White Teeth squares up to the two questions which gnaw at the very roots of our modern condition: Who are we? Why are we here?</p>",

It is frustrating not to have a more 'substantial' white family at the heart of the novel, for Irie, Millat and Magid are treated by the Chalfens with a degree of patronage that is unsurprising. Their son, Joshua, has a more complicated response to the situation, for Irie is the object of his desire. However, his two-dimensional parents do little more than enliven the more farcical elements of the narrative. There is nothing farcical about the pain of wanting to belong. In this respect, White Teeth is full of false smiles and contrived faces, masks that are repeatedly donned in order to better hide the pain. The 'mongrel' nation that is Britain is still struggling to find a way to stare into the mirror and accept the ebb and flow of history that has produced this fortuitously diverse condition and its concomitant pain. Zadie Smith's first novel is an audaciously assured contribution to this process of staring into the mirror. Her narrator is deeply self-conscious, so much so that one can almost hear the crisp echo of Salman Rushdie's footsteps. However, her wit, her breadth of vision and her ambition are of her own making. The plot is rich, at times dizzyingly so, but White Teeth squares up to the two questions which gnaw at the very roots of our modern condition: Who are we? Why are we here?",

They write that they 'shed tears while researching and writing' this work. You would have to have a heart of stone to be unmoved by some of the stories uncovered here. </p> <p>Consider the case of 11-year-old Alan McCrum (no relation) who was killed on 15 March 1982 by a no-warning car-bomb left by the IRA in the centre of Banbridge, one of a total of 34 people injured in the explosion. The Protestant schoolboy had been waiting for a friend to give him a lift home. His grieving father was reported as saying: 'It's terrible that a wee lad coming home from school should be mowed down in such a horrible way. What purpose is there in this? It's senseless. This will not be the last though, I'm sure. It will go on and on.' </p> <p>And go on and on it did, piling senseless killing on pointless slaughter, in a danse macabre that should, perhaps, have found some memorial amid the festivities of the past weekend. The senselessness of the killing in Ulster, in fact, is one great theme that the four authors identify in their introduction. </p> <p>There were, too, terrible moments of fateful farce in which the 'wrong' people died. A nine-year-old Derry boy, playing cowboys with his brother in the garden, stumbled over a tripwire and set off a bomb which killed him. A man burst into a house in Belfast, shot dead the occupant and then exclaimed: 'Christ, I'm in the wrong house.' Elsewhere, a dying man says to his wife: 'The bastards; why did they shoot me? I'm not in anything.' </p> <p>Lost Lives shows that while the great majority of the killing was done by republican groups and loyalist paramilitary organisations, the deepest source of resentment and sense of injustice is to be found among the several hundred families which lost members at the hands of the security forces. </p> <p>There is not space to do justice to the scholarly comprehensiveness, the magisterial evenhandedness or the moral integrity of this astonishing book. Now that the Troubles seem to be over, the publication of Lost Lives is perhaps the great monument for which the bloody history of Northern Ireland has been waiting.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:robert.mccrum@observer.co.uk\">robert.mccrum@observer.co.uk</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502283073,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p>",

His grieving father was reported as saying: 'It's terrible that a wee lad coming home from school should be mowed down in such a horrible way. What purpose is there in this? It's senseless. This will not be the last though, I'm sure. It will go on and on.' And go on and on it did, piling senseless killing on pointless slaughter, in a danse macabre that should, perhaps, have found some memorial amid the festivities of the past weekend. The senselessness of the killing in Ulster, in fact, is one great theme that the four authors identify in their introduction. There were, too, terrible moments of fateful farce in which the 'wrong' people died. A nine-year-old Derry boy, playing cowboys with his brother in the garden, stumbled over a tripwire and set off a bomb which killed him. A man burst into a house in Belfast, shot dead the occupant and then exclaimed: 'Christ, I'm in the wrong house.' Elsewhere, a dying man says to his wife: 'The bastards; why did they shoot me? I'm not in anything.' Lost Lives shows that while the great majority of the killing was done by republican groups and loyalist paramilitary organisations, the deepest source of resentment and sense of injustice is to be found among the several hundred families which lost members at the hands of the security forces. There is not space to do justice to the scholarly comprehensiveness, the magisterial evenhandedness or the moral integrity of this astonishing book. Now that the Troubles seem to be over, the publication of Lost Lives is perhaps the great monument for which the bloody history of Northern Ireland has been waiting. robert.mccrum@observer.co.uk Buy it at BOL",

In November, he told a conference attended by Tony Blair that it was no longer necessary to choose between growth and environment. He took as evidence Natural Capitalism - The Next Industrial Revolution (Paul Hawken and Amory and Hunter Lovins, Earthscan, \u00a318.99), which 'proves beyond argument that there are presently available technologies, and those just on the horizon, which will permit us to get richer by cleaning, not by spoiling, the environment. This is a huge deal,' Clinton said. </p> <p>It's a suitably millennial claim. The authors argue that 'capitalism, as practised, is a financially profitable, nonsustainable aberration in human development ... [which] does not fully conform to its own accounting principles. It liquidates its capital and calls it income. It neglects to assign any value to the largest stocks of capital it employs - the natural resources and living systems, as well as the social and cultural systems that are the basis of human capital.' </p> <p>Companies, as has been well said, are brilliant externalising machines - pocketing the profits and shunting the costs of their enterprise on to the collectivity. Thus, the NHS pays for the profits of big tobacco, and the Government subsidises cars by building roads. Put it another way, business is a free rider on the environment and the services it provides, services which have been tentatively valued by Nature magazine at $36 trillion annually, roughly the same as world GDP. </p> <p>The reason business is so profligate with the the environment (the 'natural capital' of the book) is that its goods are assumed by economists to be free and infinitely substitutable. So they are uncosted. But in reality they are not free. They are produced by the earth's 3.8-billion-year store of natural capital which, as the authors rehearse with hair-raising thoroughness, is being eroded so fast that by the end of this century there will be little left. And there is no conceivable substitute, for example, for the biosphere's ability to produce oxygen. </p> <p>The authors manage to recast this rush to disaster as a story with a (potentially) happier ending. Their grounds for optimism are partly familiar American technological optimism - if natural resources were treated as scarce and expensive, then nanotechnology and biotechnology could multiply four or even tenfold the outputs from today's inputs. Hence Clinton's enthusiasm. </p> <p>But more crucial to the project is a complete mental flip of what an 'output' consists of (as Edwin Land once said, a great idea is often 'not having a new thought but stopping having an old one'). </p> <p>At present, it is entirely conceivable that one-quarter or even half of the GDP of advanced countries makes not value but waste. Most industrial processes, and the economy as a whole, are inefficient - at best achieving 10 per cent of their potential; likewise their products. A car uses just 1 per cent of the energy it burns to propel the driver, the rest to warm the atmosphere, deafen pedestrians and shift ponderous steel boxes between traffic jams. </p> <p>Moreover, waste is cumulative, so an increasing income has to be spent on alleviating growth's byproducts - pollution, traffic accidents and congestion, crime. Hence the phenomenon of uneconomic growth, where increases in nominal wealth produce no net gain in quality of life or standard of living: in real terms 80 per cent of Americans are no better off than they were in 1979. </p> <p>However, the grossness of the waste is, say the authors, also a measure of the huge potential for improvement if the spiral changed to virtuous. The secret is taking a systems view in which it is always more expensive to get rid of waste than to design it out in the first place. Given the wastefulness of most current systems, improvements of 10 to 100 times in overall efficiency are possible even with existing technology. </p> <p>Much of what the Lovins and Hawken propose is not new.

      "body": "<p>Next Tuesday the family of Roger Sylvester will gather outside Tottenham Police Station for a vigil in his memory. As they light candles and say prayers, they could be forgiven for wondering when their struggle will end. It is a year since the violent arrest that led, eight days later, to the 30-year-old administrative worker's death in hospital. They still do not know what happened that cold January night. 'We're a big family so we can give each other support,' says his brother Bernard. 'I don't know how we'd have got through the ordeal otherwise.' </p> <p>The Sylvesters are unlikely to take comfort from the fact they are just one of a number of black families fighting for the truth. An Observer investigation has found that black detainees are five times more likely than whites to die in police custody, if subjected to the sort of action experienced by Roger Sylvester during their arrest . </p> <p>The majority of deaths in police custody are due to suicide or drunkenness. Overall, black deaths represent 9 per cent of the whole, greatly out of proportion considering they make up 1.8 per cent of the population. Police sources have long argued that this is because a disproportionate number of black people pass through police custody. </p> <p>In a significant number of cases the death is unconnected with suicide or drunkenness, but instead follows arrest procedures by the officers involved, such as physical restraint or the use of CS spray. The Observer's study, which looked at cases covering the years 1997 to 1999, has found that more than 43 per cent of black deaths in custody are in this category. Only 8 per cent of white people die in such circumstances. </p> <p>The findings will make dismal reading for police forces across Britain which, in the age of the Stephen Lawrence Inquiry and the Macpherson Report, are meant to be racially aware. They show no improvement from the dark days of the early and mid-Nineties when the deaths in police custody of Joy Gardner, Wayne Douglas, Brian Douglas (no relation) and Shiji Lapite as a result of suffocation under police restraint drew sharp criticism of police relations with the black community. Britain's ethnic minorities have the right to expect better. </p> <p>Our study has identified seven black deaths out of 17 between 1997 and 1999 which followed police action. The figures are completely consistent with a Home Office report covering the years 1990 to 1996 which associated nine out of 19 black deaths in police custody with behaviour by the officers involved. In the Home Office report no attempt was made to apportion blame, only to identify cases where actions of police officers appeared to be relevant in the death of a victim. We used the same criteria. </p> <p>Criminal charges against police officers are pending in one of the cases from our study. The Police Complaints Authority are investigating a further two. In the remaining four, no further investigations are being conducted and no charges have been brought against any officers. That does not mean the families have had all their questions answered, however. All of them want to know what happened. All of them want to know if the deaths could have been avoided. </p> <p>The most high profile case is Roger Sylvester's. He was arrested outside his home in North London by eight police officers after reports that a naked man had been seen in the dead of night, banging on doors and rolling on the ground. According to one account, he was bundled into a police van and taken to St. Ann's Hospital, a nearby psychiatric unit, where he was placed, still naked, in the custody of five police officers. A doctor came to assess his condition, then left the room to get a sedative. When she returned Roger had gone limp. Attempts were made to revive him but he never regained consciousness. He was eventually transferred to the Whittington Hospital where, on 18 January 1999, his life support machine was turned off and he was pronounced dead. </p> <p>At one point police sources told journalists that callers to the police that night had described him as 'aggressive'. The police later withdrew the allegation, saying Roger had committed no criminal offence that night, and an apology to the family was issued. Today the case is still the subject of an investigation by the Essex Constabulary on behalf of the Police Complaints Authority and a file has been sent to the Crown Prosecution Service for review. </p> <p>'It seems to me that there is a pattern to these things,' his brother Bernard now says. 'A person dies during arrest and the police then use the media to blame the victim. Everything goes to an inquest, no prosecution takes place and that's just about it. The process is very time consum ing and we've come to the conclusion that it's designed to wear us down.' </p> <p>Part of their problem has been gaining access to information and reports held by the investigating officers, despite the issuing of guidelines by the Home Office earlier last year instructing them to co-operate more readily with families of victims. </p> <p>The Sylvester's pathologist has now been allowed access to the report prepared by the pathologist for Essex Police, but they are determined not to reduce the pressure they are placing on the authorities, hence next week's vigil. 'We want people to know that we're still here,' says Bernard. 'We want people to know that we haven't gone away.' </p> <p>Part of the problem in establishing exactly what happened to Roger is the medical arguments surrounding the use of restraint by law enforcement officers and whether it can be solely responsible for a death. </p> <p>Professor Bernard Knight, 68, is a former Professor of Forensic Pathology at the University of Cardiff. Widely regarded as an expert in pathological signs of restraint, Knight says doctors and coroners find indicators of restraint hard to determine. </p> <p>'You can't say someone died from excessive restraint when there are no witnesses. There have been cases were people were hog-tied and forced face-down onto the ground. That has meant that some people couldn't breathe. In other cases, alcohol is a contributing factor that further obstructs the assessment of doctors examining the victims. </p> <p>'Most of these cases are hard to pinpoint simply because of the delays in coroner's reports,' he says. </p> <p>'It's a very slow moving process that understandably aggravates the families of the victims. Yes there are guidelines with restraint: people are not supposed to be held on the ground face-down for any longer than five minutes. But in the heat of the moment, how can that be regulated? And how does a coroner pick up the signs?' </p> <p>The Sylvester family have some idea of what happened to Roger. The family of Sarah Thomas, a 35-year-old architectural design student at North London University, have almost none. She was arrested using restraint last August in North London for what has been described as a minor public order offence. By the time she reached hospital she was in a coma. She later died there. 'We are still waiting to ascertain exactly what occurred on that night,' says Fiona Murphy, solicitor for Ms Thomas' family, who has wide experience of death in custody cases. 'It's clear to us that the authorities are still failing to grasp the nettle of accountability and transparency in the investigation process.' </p> <p>Little can be said about the exact details of Christopher Alder's death, as it is the subject of a forthcoming criminal case. He died in Hull police station on 1 April, 1998, where he was taken after being arrested for breach of the peace. On arrival he was found to be unconscious. Nearly two years after his death, he has yet to be buried: a preliminary inquest is set for later this summer. </p> <p>'I find the attitude of the police incredible,' says his sister, Janet. 'After his death, I spoke to the police who acted like they didn't care. We live in a predominantly white area around here, yet as an act of sympathy they sent out a black liaison officer to speak to us: something I found deeply patronising. And you begin to wonder just how long it will take to get any justice: coming on to two years from his death, his body is being kept in storage.' </p> <p>Peter San Pedro, 25, of Wood Green in North London, was taken to Kent and Canterbury Hospital in April 1997. He died of injuries sustained when he ran in front of traffic on the A2 motorway in Kent. In his final hours, he was subjected to CS spray by police officers during an arrest though he was later released. His family claim he was disorientated when he crossed the road: at an inquest in December 1997, a police-appointed doctor said he had given San Pedro a visual check-up and pronounced him fit for release. </p> <p>'CS gas, like the use of restraint, is another factor that needs to be examined,' says Judy Kennish, the San Pedro family's solicitor. 'There hasn't been enough research done into the way it is used, and how victims cope with the effects afterwards.' </p> <p>Hoosen Aubeeluck, of Mauritian descent, died at Wexham Park Hospital in Slough in September 1998. He had gone to the hospital for an appointment with a consultant who told him he had cancer. He became agitated on learning his diagnosis and began damaging hospital equipment. Police were called and they restrained him during which time he collapsed, and later died. His death was attributed to natural causes. </p> <p>In April 1997 police officers in Redruth, Cornwall went to interview an unnamed man of Australian Aboriginal descent in connection with theft. The man threatened the officer with a knife. When colleagues arrived to provide support the officers restrained the man, who was later found to have a stab wound to his leg. He died at the scene. </p> <p>Finally in May 1997 police in Berkshire assisted the medical services in restraining Darren Baverstock, who had taken an overdose of amphetamines. He later collapsed and died. An inquest ruled his death accidental and attrib uted it to amphetamine poisoning. </p> <p>Acccording to campaigners the real problem for families of victims is that they have little or no access to resources to help them find out exactly what happened. The Macpherson Report following the Lawrence Inquiry recommended that families be granted legal aid to enable them to be represented at coroner's inquests, possibly the only tribunal at which the exact circumstances of a death in custody will ever be established. Shortly after publication of the report the Home Secretary announced that legal aid would be granted to families for such inquests in 'exceptional circumstances' but this, in fact, was no change; the granting of public funds had always been in the gift of the Lord Chancellor. </p> <p>'In a lot of cases where we don't know what happened we may only find out more if families are allowed legal aid,' says Helen Shaw of Inquest, the organisation which campaigns for the families of people who have died in the custody of the state. 'What we really want is a review of all the procedures surrounding the investigation of deaths in custody. The relationship between the Police Complaints Authority, the Crown Prosecution Service and the Coroner's Court is very unclear.' She also criticises the continuing lack of disclosure of documents to families by police officers investigating suspicious deaths. </p> <p>There is no central database bringing together the figures for deaths in police custody alongside those in prisons and care units. Establishing the cause of a death inside mental institutions, for example, is particularly hard. The Mental Health Act Commission (MHAC), set up by the Department of Health in 1983, has no figures for deaths by restraint in psychiatric care around the UK. A report covering 1997-98 highlighted 374 deaths, 81 of them attributed to unnatural causes. </p> <p>A new report is being compiled for May, says MGHAC chief executive William Bingley. 'It's hard to draw conclusions from general numbers. We can pin these down to hanging, patients jumping off buildings or being run over by cars. But the backgrounds to the deaths cannot be conclusive. Anything drawn from the numbers will always be speculative.' </p> <p>The death of David 'Rocky' Bennett, who was black, is a case in point. He was certified dead in the early hours of Saturday, 31 October 1998. He spent the majority of his adult life in psychiatric care; he was a patient at the Norvic medium secure unit in Norwich at the time of his death. That night he was involved in a violent incident with another patient. His family was told that Bennett had been restrained by a group of nurses. Over a year later, an inquest is still awaiting a police investigation. </p> <p>His sister, Dr Joanna Bennett, 43, is a clinical psychologist. She blames inadequate nursing for his death; the guidelines that regulate restraint in prisons and police cells aren't as yet applied to institutional care. 'David became very disillusioned because he felt he was being slowly institutionalised, despite all his protests. We watched him turn from someone who was very intelligent and enthusiastic, to someone incredibly frustrated by his treatment. He would only ever be discharged once marked symptom-free - but those symptoms were never diagnosed. All he felt - and we saw - was the prescription of more drugs for his responses.' </p> <p>She voices a complaint common to those involved with deaths in custody: frustration with waiting for the system to provide answers. 'We're still no clearer on what exactly happened with Rocky,' she says. 'Sometimes it feels as if only the family are interested in finding out the facts. You find yourself having to go around knocking on walls to get the answers yourself. If I left it to the authorities, I'd never get to the bottom of it.' </p> <p>Families of the victims of deaths in police custody wonder if they will ever succeed in their quest. A spokesman for the Home Office said the Government was committed to dealing with the problem. 'Deaths in custody and any racial imbalance involved is something we take very seriously. It's absolutely crucial that the right kind of restraint techniques are used and to that end training of police officers has been stepped up. There are also checks and balances in place to make sure proper investigations are carried out.' </p> <p>These are good words. But they do not help the bereft families. They are left with three questions: How did their loved one die? Why did they die? And did the colour of their skin have anything to do with it? They look so simple written down like that, so straightforward. But where deaths in police custody are concerned, nothing ever is.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Next Tuesday the family of Roger Sylvester will gather outside Tottenham Police Station for a vigil in his memory. As they light candles and say prayers, they could be forgiven for wondering when their struggle will end. It is a year since the violent arrest that led, eight days later, to the 30-year-old administrative worker's death in hospital. They still do not know what happened that cold January night. 'We're a big family so we can give each other support,' says his brother Bernard. 'I don't know how we'd have got through the ordeal otherwise.' The Sylvesters are unlikely to take comfort from the fact they are just one of a number of black families fighting for the truth. An Observer investigation has found that black detainees are five times more likely than whites to die in police custody, if subjected to the sort of action experienced by Roger Sylvester during their arrest . The majority of deaths in police custody are due to suicide or drunkenness. Overall, black deaths represent 9 per cent of the whole, greatly out of proportion considering they make up 1.8 per cent of the population. Police sources have long argued that this is because a disproportionate number of black people pass through police custody. In a significant number of cases the death is unconnected with suicide or drunkenness, but instead follows arrest procedures by the officers involved, such as physical restraint or the use of CS spray. The Observer's study, which looked at cases covering the years 1997 to 1999, has found that more than 43 per cent of black deaths in custody are in this category. Only 8 per cent of white people die in such circumstances. The findings will make dismal reading for police forces across Britain which, in the age of the Stephen Lawrence Inquiry and the Macpherson Report, are meant to be racially aware. They show no improvement from the dark days of the early and mid-Nineties when the deaths in police custody of Joy Gardner, Wayne Douglas, Brian Douglas (no relation) and Shiji Lapite as a result of suffocation under police restraint drew sharp criticism of police relations with the black community. Britain's ethnic minorities have the right to expect better. Our study has identified seven black deaths out of 17 between 1997 and 1999 which followed police action. The figures are completely consistent with a Home Office report covering the years 1990 to 1996 which associated nine out of 19 black deaths in police custody with behaviour by the officers involved. In the Home Office report no attempt was made to apportion blame, only to identify cases where actions of police officers appeared to be relevant in the death of a victim. We used the same criteria. Criminal charges against police officers are pending in one of the cases from our study. The Police Complaints Authority are investigating a further two. In the remaining four, no further investigations are being conducted and no charges have been brought against any officers. That does not mean the families have had all their questions answered, however. All of them want to know what happened. All of them want to know if the deaths could have been avoided. The most high profile case is Roger Sylvester's. He was arrested outside his home in North London by eight police officers after reports that a naked man had been seen in the dead of night, banging on doors and rolling on the ground. According to one account, he was bundled into a police van and taken to St. Ann's Hospital, a nearby psychiatric unit, where he was placed, still naked, in the custody of five police officers. A doctor came to assess his condition, then left the room to get a sedative. When she returned Roger had gone limp. Attempts were made to revive him but he never regained consciousness. He was eventually transferred to the Whittington Hospital where, on 18 January 1999, his life support machine was turned off and he was pronounced dead. At one point police sources told journalists that callers to the police that night had described him as 'aggressive'. The police later withdrew the allegation, saying Roger had committed no criminal offence that night, and an apology to the family was issued. Today the case is still the subject of an investigation by the Essex Constabulary on behalf of the Police Complaints Authority and a file has been sent to the Crown Prosecution Service for review. 'It seems to me that there is a pattern to these things,' his brother Bernard now says. 'A person dies during arrest and the police then use the media to blame the victim. Everything goes to an inquest, no prosecution takes place and that's just about it. The process is very time consum ing and we've come to the conclusion that it's designed to wear us down.' Part of their problem has been gaining access to information and reports held by the investigating officers, despite the issuing of guidelines by the Home Office earlier last year instructing them to co-operate more readily with families of victims. The Sylvester's pathologist has now been allowed access to the report prepared by the pathologist for Essex Police, but they are determined not to reduce the pressure they are placing on the authorities, hence next week's vigil. 'We want people to know that we're still here,' says Bernard. 'We want people to know that we haven't gone away.' Part of the problem in establishing exactly what happened to Roger is the medical arguments surrounding the use of restraint by law enforcement officers and whether it can be solely responsible for a death. Professor Bernard Knight, 68, is a former Professor of Forensic Pathology at the University of Cardiff. Widely regarded as an expert in pathological signs of restraint, Knight says doctors and coroners find indicators of restraint hard to determine. 'You can't say someone died from excessive restraint when there are no witnesses. There have been cases were people were hog-tied and forced face-down onto the ground. That has meant that some people couldn't breathe. In other cases, alcohol is a contributing factor that further obstructs the assessment of doctors examining the victims. 'Most of these cases are hard to pinpoint simply because of the delays in coroner's reports,' he says. 'It's a very slow moving process that understandably aggravates the families of the victims. Yes there are guidelines with restraint: people are not supposed to be held on the ground face-down for any longer than five minutes. But in the heat of the moment, how can that be regulated? And how does a coroner pick up the signs?' The Sylvester family have some idea of what happened to Roger. The family of Sarah Thomas, a 35-year-old architectural design student at North London University, have almost none. She was arrested using restraint last August in North London for what has been described as a minor public order offence. By the time she reached hospital she was in a coma. She later died there. 'We are still waiting to ascertain exactly what occurred on that night,' says Fiona Murphy, solicitor for Ms Thomas' family, who has wide experience of death in custody cases. 'It's clear to us that the authorities are still failing to grasp the nettle of accountability and transparency in the investigation process.' Little can be said about the exact details of Christopher Alder's death, as it is the subject of a forthcoming criminal case. He died in Hull police station on 1 April, 1998, where he was taken after being arrested for breach of the peace. On arrival he was found to be unconscious. Nearly two years after his death, he has yet to be buried: a preliminary inquest is set for later this summer. 'I find the attitude of the police incredible,' says his sister, Janet. 'After his death, I spoke to the police who acted like they didn't care. We live in a predominantly white area around here, yet as an act of sympathy they sent out a black liaison officer to speak to us: something I found deeply patronising. And you begin to wonder just how long it will take to get any justice: coming on to two years from his death, his body is being kept in storage.' Peter San Pedro, 25, of Wood Green in North London, was taken to Kent and Canterbury Hospital in April 1997. He died of injuries sustained when he ran in front of traffic on the A2 motorway in Kent. In his final hours, he was subjected to CS spray by police officers during an arrest though he was later released. His family claim he was disorientated when he crossed the road: at an inquest in December 1997, a police-appointed doctor said he had given San Pedro a visual check-up and pronounced him fit for release. 'CS gas, like the use of restraint, is another factor that needs to be examined,' says Judy Kennish, the San Pedro family's solicitor. 'There hasn't been enough research done into the way it is used, and how victims cope with the effects afterwards.' Hoosen Aubeeluck, of Mauritian descent, died at Wexham Park Hospital in Slough in September 1998. He had gone to the hospital for an appointment with a consultant who told him he had cancer. He became agitated on learning his diagnosis and began damaging hospital equipment. Police were called and they restrained him during which time he collapsed, and later died. His death was attributed to natural causes. In April 1997 police officers in Redruth, Cornwall went to interview an unnamed man of Australian Aboriginal descent in connection with theft. The man threatened the officer with a knife. When colleagues arrived to provide support the officers restrained the man, who was later found to have a stab wound to his leg. He died at the scene. Finally in May 1997 police in Berkshire assisted the medical services in restraining Darren Baverstock, who had taken an overdose of amphetamines. He later collapsed and died. An inquest ruled his death accidental and attrib uted it to amphetamine poisoning. Acccording to campaigners the real problem for families of victims is that they have little or no access to resources to help them find out exactly what happened. The Macpherson Report following the Lawrence Inquiry recommended that families be granted legal aid to enable them to be represented at coroner's inquests, possibly the only tribunal at which the exact circumstances of a death in custody will ever be established. Shortly after publication of the report the Home Secretary announced that legal aid would be granted to families for such inquests in 'exceptional circumstances' but this, in fact, was no change; the granting of public funds had always been in the gift of the Lord Chancellor. 'In a lot of cases where we don't know what happened we may only find out more if families are allowed legal aid,' says Helen Shaw of Inquest, the organisation which campaigns for the families of people who have died in the custody of the state. 'What we really want is a review of all the procedures surrounding the investigation of deaths in custody.

      "body": "<p> Some years ago, Canadian actress Molly Parker was playing a prostitute in a TV show. As she recalls, she looked the part - 'halter top, miniskirt, knee-length boots' - as she lounged on a street corner, chewing gum and looking out into the middle distance with dead-eyed boredom. Suddenly a car pulled to a halt and the driver beckoned her over. She does not remember much about him except that he was deeply average, just an ordinary, middle-class, middle-aged man, but she does remember the two empty child safety seats in the back. </p> <p>Walking cautiously over to him, Parker leaned over and whispered something that made his blood run cold: 'I'd get out of here, if I were you. You're being filmed.' And with that, she motioned to a camera crew sta tioned across the road, close enough to get the naturalistic shot they wanted and far enough to be unobtrusive to the careless kerb crawler. The driver panicked and hit the accelerator, making a dramatic U-turn. Parker does not know exactly what he said to the crew but she found out later that he was almost in tears of desperation, begging for the film, offering money if they promised to destroy it. 'I almost felt sorry for him,' she says with a wry smile. </p> <p>The scene, of course, was never used, but it is tempting to wonder what the director of Parker's latest film, Wonderland , might have done with such material. For in Wonderland Michael Winterbottom goes further than anything we have seen since the heyday of Italian neo-realism, making unwitting stars of the people of London as a backdrop to a complex and moving family drama. </p> <p>Written by Laurence Coriat, Wonderland centres on three working-class sisters - Nadia (Gina McKee), Debbie (Shirley Henderson) and Molly (Molly Parker) - who are trying to keep on top of life in the fast-moving capital. Sandwich bar assistant Nadia is single and looking for love in the lonely hearts column; hairdresser Debbie is a reluctant single mother, while Molly is coping with heavy pregnancy and a commitment-phobic boyfriend. </p> <p>These stories may be ordinary, but Wonderland is definitely not. 'What appealed to me about the screenplay was that it created a picture of London which I recognised but hadn't seen on film before,' said Winterbottom. 'That sense of restlessness, of that constant battle [people have] to keep their heads above water and, more importantly, find some space and time in which to try and enjoy life.' To convey that, Winterbottom and co-producer Andrew Eaton decided to abandon the rulebook and go into London with a hit-and-run crew of just three or four, shooting almost unobtrusively with a 16mm camera and next to no lighting. Eaton said: 'We wanted to go into real places, use real people and tell the story in what was almost a documentary style.' </p> <p>The result is possibly one of the most authentic depictions of London ever filmed, balancing the shimmering glare of the capital's nightlife with the mundaneness of day-to-day life. But some might question the ethics of filming 'ordinary' people without their knowledge. 'Michael had this very clear idea of how he wanted us to rehearse,' said Parker, 'and that wasn't in the traditional sense of sitting down with the text and going through it together. He really wanted us to actively go out and try to participate in these characters' lives.' </p> <p>Which meant that Winterbottom had some very unusual requests for his cast. Kika Markham, who plays Eileen, the girls' mother, was sent out Christmas shopping in character to buy presents for her entire screen 'family'. The three sisters, plus the actor who plays their estranged brother Darren, all had to spend a couple of days in the house that served as the location for their parents' house - even though some of them did not even have any scenes there. Parker, after deciding that her character was a primary school teacher, was promptly dispatched to a local school, where she spent a day helping out with a class of four- and five-year-olds. </p> <p>Curiously, her character's occupation is never shown or mentioned. And although Parker was fitted with a bulky padded dress that gave some sense of how it would physically feel to be pregnant, that still was not quite enough. 'Michael had me get on a bus,' she says, 'and go to all these hospitals to find out what it's actually like to be that pregnant. I talked to all these fantastic women who were just really frank with me about the gory details.' </p> <p>Just in case that was not enough realism, Molly has her child - on location, in Lewisham Hospital, south London. 'There were two babies that we used; two babies that were born that morning. Truly newborns - their bottoms and their heads fit into one hand - and their mothers were right there. It was an extraordinary experience, but what was so neat about the way Michael made this film was that we didn't have to go into some studio, we actually got to do it in a maternity ward, where women were giving birth almost literally in the next room. And the midwife in the film is the midwife in the hospital. She's amazing - I want her to be my midwife if I ever have children.' </p> <p>But although these flourishes seem, at worst, a little eccentric, what responsibility do the filmmakers have to the real people being used? Parker stresses that there was a script - a written, well-crafted script, with characters and scenarios - but concedes that the dialogue frequently had to be abandoned if real life came too close. 'And because we were so often outside, we were just like regular people walking around, so we had to be open to anything that would happen. We couldn't possibly be in a situation where we could be exact, stick to the script, and do it over and over again, because within seconds we'd have 20 people standing and watching. We had to be much more incognito than that.' </p> <p>'There's this amazing bit of footage of Gina McKee taking the Tube, and they just followed her, through the station, on the train. It was about 45 minutes of footage and it was during rush hour. But nobody even looked at the camera. All these people! Once in a while someone would, but I'm sure they thought it was just a newsreel.' </p> <p>In some ways, Wonderland is perhaps just a sad indictment of the indifference of Londoners. An example of this is the scene in which Parker's character is about to give birth. She's standing on the corner of Shaftesbury Avenue and Dean Street, clutching her stomach and screaming, while 'Debbie' tries to hail a cab. A man walks up to see if she's all right; Molly all but ignores him and the camera tracks back into the distance. So, once the scene was over, did she explain to him that she was an actress? No. The man took off and they simply kept filming. 'All these people were coming up to me,' says Parker, 'and Shirley - she cracks me up - was going, \"Dahn't warry, she's 'avin' a bay-bee.\" With a cigarette hanging out of her mouth! And immediately all the men turned and walked away, but the women stayed. But because it's London, it took Shirley 15 minutes to get a cab. The scene itself isn't that long because they cut it, but, in real life it went on, like, forever and ever and ever. And those are the things that really happen in people's lives.' </p> <p>Not everyone, however, is so enamoured with the process. Earl (not his real name) works in the film industry and was surprised when a friend, who had seen a rough cut of the film, told him he had made an unexpected cameo. Watching the scene, Earl remembers the day by the clothes he was wearing, and certainly remembers the Soho sandwich bar where he goes most days for lunch, but has no recollection of the camera and was definitely not given any warning. He has no problem with the film. - 'It's hardly embarrassing. How could I possibly disgrace myself in a sandwich bar?' - but feels slightly uneasy with the sleight of hand used to get the shot. </p> <p>Parker, though, has no such qualms. 'I think it's remarkable to watch a film where - they call it atmosphere - the people in the background are real people, people going to work and getting on with their lives, and not some guys getting paid $7 an hour to dress up in a suit and walk by with a briefcase. There are things you see every day in a city that make you think, \"You could never put that in a movie - no one would ever believe you, it's too absurd.\" But you get that sense in this film people really are living their lives. I think it's one of the things that makes this film so rich.' </p> <p>For his part, Earl has no problem being part of the rich tapestry of London life but he does feel a little chagrined at being filmed without his knowledge. Winterbottom's realism, he thinks, is uncomfortably too real. 'There's no harm done and I suppose I don't really mind,' he concedes. 'But if someone wanted to talk money, I wouldn't say no.' </p> <p>\u0095 Wonderland opens on Friday.</p>",

Parker, after deciding that her character was a primary school teacher, was promptly dispatched to a local school, where she spent a day helping out with a class of four- and five-year-olds. Curiously, her character's occupation is never shown or mentioned. And although Parker was fitted with a bulky padded dress that gave some sense of how it would physically feel to be pregnant, that still was not quite enough. 'Michael had me get on a bus,' she says, 'and go to all these hospitals to find out what it's actually like to be that pregnant. I talked to all these fantastic women who were just really frank with me about the gory details.' Just in case that was not enough realism, Molly has her child - on location, in Lewisham Hospital, south London. 'There were two babies that we used; two babies that were born that morning. Truly newborns - their bottoms and their heads fit into one hand - and their mothers were right there. It was an extraordinary experience, but what was so neat about the way Michael made this film was that we didn't have to go into some studio, we actually got to do it in a maternity ward, where women were giving birth almost literally in the next room. And the midwife in the film is the midwife in the hospital. She's amazing - I want her to be my midwife if I ever have children.' But although these flourishes seem, at worst, a little eccentric, what responsibility do the filmmakers have to the real people being used? Parker stresses that there was a script - a written, well-crafted script, with characters and scenarios - but concedes that the dialogue frequently had to be abandoned if real life came too close. 'And because we were so often outside, we were just like regular people walking around, so we had to be open to anything that would happen. We couldn't possibly be in a situation where we could be exact, stick to the script, and do it over and over again, because within seconds we'd have 20 people standing and watching. We had to be much more incognito than that.' 'There's this amazing bit of footage of Gina McKee taking the Tube, and they just followed her, through the station, on the train. It was about 45 minutes of footage and it was during rush hour. But nobody even looked at the camera. All these people! Once in a while someone would, but I'm sure they thought it was just a newsreel.' In some ways, Wonderland is perhaps just a sad indictment of the indifference of Londoners. An example of this is the scene in which Parker's character is about to give birth. She's standing on the corner of Shaftesbury Avenue and Dean Street, clutching her stomach and screaming, while 'Debbie' tries to hail a cab. A man walks up to see if she's all right; Molly all but ignores him and the camera tracks back into the distance. So, once the scene was over, did she explain to him that she was an actress? No. The man took off and they simply kept filming. 'All these people were coming up to me,' says Parker, 'and Shirley - she cracks me up - was going, \"Dahn't warry, she's 'avin' a bay-bee.\" With a cigarette hanging out of her mouth! And immediately all the men turned and walked away, but the women stayed. But because it's London, it took Shirley 15 minutes to get a cab. The scene itself isn't that long because they cut it, but, in real life it went on, like, forever and ever and ever. And those are the things that really happen in people's lives.' Not everyone, however, is so enamoured with the process. Earl (not his real name) works in the film industry and was surprised when a friend, who had seen a rough cut of the film, told him he had made an unexpected cameo. Watching the scene, Earl remembers the day by the clothes he was wearing, and certainly remembers the Soho sandwich bar where he goes most days for lunch, but has no recollection of the camera and was definitely not given any warning. He has no problem with the film. - 'It's hardly embarrassing. How could I possibly disgrace myself in a sandwich bar?' - but feels slightly uneasy with the sleight of hand used to get the shot. Parker, though, has no such qualms. 'I think it's remarkable to watch a film where - they call it atmosphere - the people in the background are real people, people going to work and getting on with their lives, and not some guys getting paid $7 an hour to dress up in a suit and walk by with a briefcase. There are things you see every day in a city that make you think, \"You could never put that in a movie - no one would ever believe you, it's too absurd.\" But you get that sense in this film people really are living their lives. I think it's one of the things that makes this film so rich.' For his part, Earl has no problem being part of the rich tapestry of London life but he does feel a little chagrined at being filmed without his knowledge. Winterbottom's realism, he thinks, is uncomfortably too real. 'There's no harm done and I suppose I don't really mind,' he concedes. 'But if someone wanted to talk money, I wouldn't say no.' \u0095 Wonderland opens on Friday.",

      "body": "<p>Starch is only truly acceptable with a seasoning of fat. Think toast without butter, pizza without cheese, pasta without olive oil and a baked potato without its compulsory dollop of butter and cheese. Even the most abstemious steamed potato is only worth eating when you dip it in the accompanying sauce or gravy. This isn't gluttony. It is simply easier and more pleasing to get your carbohydrates down with a suitable lubricant. Low-fat alternatives not only fail to hit the bliss point, but their complex manufacture is somewhat dark and mysterious and a world away from the simple pressing of an olive or the churning of cream into butter. I will go along with the idea that a healthy diet contains a hefty amount of carbohydrate, just as long as it includes a judicious helping of dairy produce to help it down. </p> <p>Though pasta and noodles are now well established in our national diet, the potato remains the British carbohydrate of choice. Which is just as well. You can't grow rice for love nor money in this climate. The new potato, so neat and nutty, is all very well sharing a plate with grilled sole or a few slices of the new season's lamb, but when the weather is cold and wet, only a bulging King Edward, Maris Peer or red-skinned Desiree will do. Trudging home, chilled to the bone, it is only the thought of a hot potato that keeps me going. Better still, a potato with a generous slick of melted butter, cheese or cream. </p> <p>With a little effort, we can be even more comforting than that. The dishes that brought that Readybrek glow to me as a kid may be out of step with what we eat now, but they can easily be re-thought to include better-quality ingredients. The old cheese and potato pie I used to tuck into at school, a deeply warming double whammy of pastry and potato, is immeasurably more interesting when made with cream and a melting cheese such as Fontina or Taleggio. Those who scoff at the idea of pommes dauphinoise in a puff pastry crust (for that is what it is) are obviously not wet or cold enough. </p> <p>Those who have an allergy to potato peeling may like to try slicing them thinly and layering them with Taleggio and sage leaves before cooking them gently over a low heat till the potato slices turn the colour of autumn leaves and the cheese forms long strings. Of course, there is always the baked potato. A huge spud, baked till the skin cracks and the flesh is like snow, will satisfy not just the hungry but those coming home so cold and numb as to be incapable of thinking of anything more interesting. </p> <p>I will not hear a word against a baked potato supper. The pedestrian butter and grated cheese topping can be jazzed up a bit, though. I often let onions cook down over a low heat with a good-sized knob of butter until they are golden and soft enough to squish between the fingers, then pour in a spoonful of grainy mustard and a glug or two of cream. The resulting sauce has both the hit of mustard and the soothing stroke of dairy produce. You need to remember to start the onions a good half an hour before you think you will need them. </p> <p>The ultimate cheese and potato supper must surely be aligot, a deep, pale and creamy mash of potatoes, butter, cream and cheese, seasoned with garlic, salt and black pepper. It is as soothing a plate of food as you will ever find. Consoling and blissfully gratifying, aligot is traditionally made with la Tomme frache de Cantal, and is subject to many rules and superstitions, including the idea that the mixture should always be stirred in the same direction. It is an Auvergne dish, and one that I have never tasted in its rightful place, though I do know that it takes a bit of stirring to get it as light as the locals insist it should be. I am not sure they would forgive my home-grown version that includes simply mashing any cheese that will melt into hot, creamy mashed potato. But right now, I am too cold and hungry to care. </p> <p> <strong> Potato and Fontina pie</strong> </p> <p> An update of the old cheese and potato pie.

Turn off the heat. </p> <p>Set the oven at 220 C/gas mark 7. Roll out the pastry to line a 23cm loose-bottomed non-stick cake tin, pressing the pastry neatly into the corners and pulling it gently up the sides.

Flip the edges of the pastry over the top layer to form a loose lid, pinching the edges together wherever you need to. Cut or poke a hole through the pastry to let out the steam as it cooks. </p> <p>Bake for 50 to 60 minutes, turning the oven down to 190 C/gas mark 5 after the first 10 minutes. The pie is ready when the pastry is crisp and golden brown, not just on the top, but the sides and base as well. </p> <p>Let the pie cool for 5 minutes or so before running a palette knife around the edge to loosen it from the tin.

      "body": "<p>Just as surely as green is the new black, bonsai is the new garden fix. As age, or even more importantly, the impression of age is the most venerable aspect of bonsai, this is at odds with much of the current trends in gardening, where newness and change and impermanence rule. But, in many ways, bonsai is the epitome of gardening. It takes a naturally occurring plant and manicures, trains and tames it to a miniature representation of itself, which a garden does of the landscape. </p> <p>Bonsai is small. It is the reduction, almost ad absurdum, of things bigger and stronger than us. The whole aim is to create an impression of nature, and the more weathered and untamable the image is, the greater the skill. </p> <p>The first bonsai trees only came west at the end of the last century amid the general fascination with all things Japanese (it had originated in China, spreading to Japan in the 11th century). The Royal Horticultural Society has been exhibiting bonsai for more than 90 years - it is one of the stars of the Chelsea Flower Show, given extra charm by the fact that most exhibits are amateur or by small nurseries that have 'made' all their plants. (In bonsai circles, plants are made rather than grown. And there is a logic to this when one considers how minutely they are shaped and trained, pruned and primped and that their makers consider them living sculpture rather than just plants.) </p> <p>I spoke to Colin Ellis, chairman of Bonsai Kai, the oldest Bonsai society in Europe and a member of the committee of the RHS. He reckoned that there was not necessarily an increase in bonsai enthusiasts despite the increase in sales - a sizeable number of trees die and their owners give up as a result. Also he pointed out that many of the cheap bonsai you can buy in department stores and garden centres for around \u00a320 to \u00a350 are from China, Thailand or Malaysia and are not temperate plants. They must therefore be kept indoors with all the attendant problems. People put them on the television or near a radiator and the things dry up and die in days. People seem to think that the combination of miniaturisation and appearance of age implies a kind of pickling, so the plants do not need watering or caring for. This is miles from the truth. </p> <p>It is far easier to grow bonsai that are either indigenous or from a temperate zone similar to our own. This means that the plants can spend the majority of their lives outside. I certainly tend to think of them as indoor plants, and Ellis admitted that they do not fit easily into most gardens. 'But,' he said, 'you can go to Japan and see what looks like a potato field of plants growing on ridges and they turn out to be white pines ( Pinus parviflora ) growing for bonsai. The reason for that is that they grow faster outside because the roots have a better run. People think that bonsai is about restricting growth. It is actually about getting things to grow fast, but to control it - not to slow it down unnaturally. Consequently, many growers only pot up their plants in order to exhibit them.' The main limitation on growth is not through pruning, which tends to provoke stronger growth, but by keeping the roots severely constrained (rather like footbinding in their tiny containers), which are the artificial equivalent of the trees you see growing out of rocks in mountains. The rule of thumb is that the depth of the container should correspond to the thickness of the trunk of the tree, and the diameter of the pot should be the same as the diameter of the crown. </p> <p>As you might expect, everything in bonsai is codified, from the container shape and size to the shape and form of the plant. It is ballet rather than a rave. Bonsai appeals to the combination of gardener and obsessive controller, channelling that control into something rather than into the normal horticultural obsession of collecting. Nevertheless, serious bonsai enthusiasts get the collection bug, too. 'It becomes addictive,' said Ellis. 'I had 180 at one time and most enthusiasts' collections don't really relate to their garden.' Perhaps this is true of all collections: they only ever relate to themselves. But how do people afford to buy all these enormously expensive trees? 'They don't,' he said. 'Most people make their own by grafting and taking cuttings.' So do these collections become enormously valuable? 'No. people have an inflated idea of what bonsai is worth. There was a sale of bonsai at Sotheby's a few years ago where some 400-year-old pieces went for \u00a320,000, but the real skill is in making a 40-year-old tree look 400 years.' </p> <p>Nevertheless, companies buy bonsai as investments, treating them as works of art and selling them on at a profit. To service this business, there are professional stylists that travel the world shaping and training the trees every few months, like hairdressers or private trainers. </p> <p>One of the problems I have always had with bonsai is how to use them in the context of a garden. Ellis agreed that this was often a problem. 'Unless you have a large garden and can use them as judiciously placed focal points, you can't put them easily into a garden.' Perhaps a balcony or verandah is best. </p> <p>Harmony in the bonsaied bush is everything, and to that end, branches are cut off and grafted into new positions, wires are attached to redirect the angle of growth, and the entire tree is regularly lifted out of its container and the roots pruned. No operation is too complicated to enhance beauty and assist the ageing process. </p> <p>The trunk of a bonsai is short and stubby, tapering as it grows. One that has grown too long can be shortened from the bottom by provoking new root growth above the existing soil layer. Otherwise, pruning as it grows and the passing of time will achieve the desired effect. </p> <p>Branches can be added by drilling through the trunk and sticking a seedling through the hole, keeping its roots in a small pot stuck on to the side of the main tree. As the seedling grows it will swell to graft with the tree. When you think it has properly bonded, remove the pot and soil from the roots of the seedling and let them dry out. If the leaves of the new 'branch' do not wither it means that nourishment is getting to it via the main trunk and the old seedling roots can be trimmed off. The seedling can also be grafted on to a wound made on the side of the trunk. </p> <p>Wiring is done in two ways. Either it is wound corkscrew fashion around the branch and trunk, flexible enough to allow the branch to be adjusted to an exact position and rigid enough to hold it there, or guys are anchored to the container, making the Lilliputian tree look paradoxically like Gulliver, tied to the ground.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Just as surely as green is the new black, bonsai is the new garden fix. As age, or even more importantly, the impression of age is the most venerable aspect of bonsai, this is at odds with much of the current trends in gardening, where newness and change and impermanence rule. But, in many ways, bonsai is the epitome of gardening. It takes a naturally occurring plant and manicures, trains and tames it to a miniature representation of itself, which a garden does of the landscape. Bonsai is small. It is the reduction, almost ad absurdum, of things bigger and stronger than us. The whole aim is to create an impression of nature, and the more weathered and untamable the image is, the greater the skill. The first bonsai trees only came west at the end of the last century amid the general fascination with all things Japanese (it had originated in China, spreading to Japan in the 11th century). The Royal Horticultural Society has been exhibiting bonsai for more than 90 years - it is one of the stars of the Chelsea Flower Show, given extra charm by the fact that most exhibits are amateur or by small nurseries that have 'made' all their plants. (In bonsai circles, plants are made rather than grown. And there is a logic to this when one considers how minutely they are shaped and trained, pruned and primped and that their makers consider them living sculpture rather than just plants.) I spoke to Colin Ellis, chairman of Bonsai Kai, the oldest Bonsai society in Europe and a member of the committee of the RHS. He reckoned that there was not necessarily an increase in bonsai enthusiasts despite the increase in sales - a sizeable number of trees die and their owners give up as a result. Also he pointed out that many of the cheap bonsai you can buy in department stores and garden centres for around \u00a320 to \u00a350 are from China, Thailand or Malaysia and are not temperate plants. They must therefore be kept indoors with all the attendant problems. People put them on the television or near a radiator and the things dry up and die in days.

      "body": "<p>'Oh I'm much calmer, less controlling, more relaxed these days,' says Alan Parker, smiling, telling me how he has not only written and directed the film version of Frank McCourt's bestseller Angela's Ashes, but also produced the film's poster on his Xerox at home and done the graphic design for the press pack.</p> <p> In the past, he admits, he has been fond of suggesting that 'directing a film is a crash course in megalomania' and that he 'enjoys the Stalinist approach to moviemaking - as long as I am Stalin' (in homage to this he has a bust of Uncle Joe in his office presented to him by his colleagues). But all that has changed. </p> <p> Parker has matured, he suggests, mellowed even. Having waged guerrilla warfare against the film establishment in Britain for nearly three decades, he now is that establishment, chairman of new Labour's new Film Council. The perceived chippiness of the Islington advertising man in Hollywood has, he implies, been replaced by a new kind of phlegmatic wisdom.</p> <p> He reflects on this personal evolution for a moment. 'Of course my film crew would fall about laughing if they heard me say any of that,' he concedes. Parker, explaining his new-found laissez-faire, has a pent-up quality, which seems like it might dissolve into rage. He wears his jacket buttoned and straining, as if to hold his impatience in; he mostly talks gruffly at the floor.</p> <p> 'When I started directing I disagreed with a lot of people and an entire philosophy about what made a good film,' he says. 'a) They thought because you've got a cockney accent you're stupid, which is the ultimate insult, and b) if you disagreed with that intellectually snobby establishment they said you just had a chip on your shoulder. It was easy shit to put out, but I don't think anyone buys that any more...' </p> <p> In any case, he is at great pains to stress, he no longer feels the need to continually fight his artistic corner. 'I have always said the same thing,' he says, 'that American cinema is the cinema of the audience. I am just as much an auteur as any so-called European director, except that I have to justify people giving me a lot of money. It would be much easier to make an \"art\" film for my relatives and three critics. But, as I say, I don't think I need to make that argument any more.' </p> <p>For someone who no longer feels the need to explain himself, Alan Parker does a good deal of explaining. He has just returned from several weeks of television interviews in America and Europe promoting his film. 'In Germany you get seven minutes; in America you get four, including a clip, so it's really just \"good evening\" and you're off.' Which is just as well, really, because the more he talks about the process of film-making, the less he feels he has anything to say.</p> <p> 'So much of it is instinctive. I'm sure Trevor Nunn can explain it, but I'm so badly educated I've never been able to articulate it.' Still, as he insists, he's not chippy. Parker first read Angela's Ashes as a manuscript, long before the book was published, and tried to buy the film rights then, only to discover that they had already been acquired by the American producer Scott Rudin. When the project eventually came his way, a screenplay had been written, but he went back to the book and started again. 'It was a matter of plundering and giving it a bit more heart,' he says, and anyway, he's always written his own films.</p> <p> 'It's the only way to get the thing really inside your head.' To orient himself in the Limerick of Frank McCourt's childhood, Parker used a map of the book's key locations he'd found on a Japanese web site for Angela's Ashes obsessives. The site brought home to him the extraordinary and universal appeal of a book which had sold six million copies in around 30 countries. Its author was a big help and inspiration, too: 'Frank had been a schoolteacher in New York for so many years that he has this endlessly encouraging and patient manner,' says Parker.</p> <p> 'Even though, when I finished it, it did feel a bit like putting an essay in to your English teacher. You know, \"must try harder\".' (McCourt returns the compliment suggesting that Parker understood the book so well because 'he comes from a blue-collar background and I come from a no-collar background'.) The difficulties of putting McCourt's memoir on film were always likely to be in preventing its sentiment from becoming too mawkish: it begins, brightly, with the death of the author's baby sister and infant twin brothers from a mixture of illness and malnutrition, and then the trouble really starts. </p> <p>Parker succeeds in keeping the grimness in check through perfor mances of great intensity and restraint from Robert Carlyle and Emily Watson, who play McCourt's parents, as well as inspirational, and often comic, debuts by the boys who play the growing Frank (typically Parker auditioned 15,000 children to find the Franks he wanted: 'If you get the casting right, the rest takes care of itself,' he says). Even so, as in the book, the real stars of Angela's Ashes are Poverty and Damp, which stalk the hopes of the ever-optimistic McCourt children like personifications from medieval mystery plays. </p> <p>This is perhaps the wettest film ever made.

It sluices through the back alleys of Limerick before collecting in big plashy puddles in the McCourts' front room. Ever the craftsman, Parker spent a couple of months at Technicolor, working with a new grading process that holds more of the silver in the print. Thus, as the McCourt family push their soggy belongings in dripping hand carts from one waterlogged basement to another they are bathed in a kind of sepulchral sepia glitter which lends some scenes a monumental pathos (though there are occasional moments, too, when you feel as if you are watching the most lavish Hovis ad ever made).</p> <p> Two decades ago, the New Yorker 's distinguished film critic Pauline Kael suggested that Alan Parker had 'technique to burn'.

Parker also exercised America's moral majority and the censors with Angel Heart when he poured chicken blood onto Mickey Rourke's buttocks as he had 'voodoo sex' with Lisa Bonet. He survived, too, making Evita in Buenos Aires, where he was greeted with death threats after casting Madonna - 'Satan in drag' according to the city's bishop - as the lead.

      "bodyText": "'Oh I'm much calmer, less controlling, more relaxed these days,' says Alan Parker, smiling, telling me how he has not only written and directed the film version of Frank McCourt's bestseller Angela's Ashes, but also produced the film's poster on his Xerox at home and done the graphic design for the press pack. In the past, he admits, he has been fond of suggesting that 'directing a film is a crash course in megalomania' and that he 'enjoys the Stalinist approach to moviemaking - as long as I am Stalin' (in homage to this he has a bust of Uncle Joe in his office presented to him by his colleagues). But all that has changed. Parker has matured, he suggests, mellowed even. Having waged guerrilla warfare against the film establishment in Britain for nearly three decades, he now is that establishment, chairman of new Labour's new Film Council. The perceived chippiness of the Islington advertising man in Hollywood has, he implies, been replaced by a new kind of phlegmatic wisdom. He reflects on this personal evolution for a moment. 'Of course my film crew would fall about laughing if they heard me say any of that,' he concedes. Parker, explaining his new-found laissez-faire, has a pent-up quality, which seems like it might dissolve into rage. He wears his jacket buttoned and straining, as if to hold his impatience in; he mostly talks gruffly at the floor. 'When I started directing I disagreed with a lot of people and an entire philosophy about what made a good film,' he says. 'a) They thought because you've got a cockney accent you're stupid, which is the ultimate insult, and b) if you disagreed with that intellectually snobby establishment they said you just had a chip on your shoulder. It was easy shit to put out, but I don't think anyone buys that any more...' In any case, he is at great pains to stress, he no longer feels the need to continually fight his artistic corner. 'I have always said the same thing,' he says, 'that American cinema is the cinema of the audience. I am just as much an auteur as any so-called European director, except that I have to justify people giving me a lot of money. It would be much easier to make an \"art\" film for my relatives and three critics. But, as I say, I don't think I need to make that argument any more.' For someone who no longer feels the need to explain himself, Alan Parker does a good deal of explaining. He has just returned from several weeks of television interviews in America and Europe promoting his film. 'In Germany you get seven minutes; in America you get four, including a clip, so it's really just \"good evening\" and you're off.' Which is just as well, really, because the more he talks about the process of film-making, the less he feels he has anything to say. 'So much of it is instinctive. I'm sure Trevor Nunn can explain it, but I'm so badly educated I've never been able to articulate it.' Still, as he insists, he's not chippy. Parker first read Angela's Ashes as a manuscript, long before the book was published, and tried to buy the film rights then, only to discover that they had already been acquired by the American producer Scott Rudin. When the project eventually came his way, a screenplay had been written, but he went back to the book and started again. 'It was a matter of plundering and giving it a bit more heart,' he says, and anyway, he's always written his own films. 'It's the only way to get the thing really inside your head.' To orient himself in the Limerick of Frank McCourt's childhood, Parker used a map of the book's key locations he'd found on a Japanese web site for Angela's Ashes obsessives. The site brought home to him the extraordinary and universal appeal of a book which had sold six million copies in around 30 countries. Its author was a big help and inspiration, too: 'Frank had been a schoolteacher in New York for so many years that he has this endlessly encouraging and patient manner,' says Parker. 'Even though, when I finished it, it did feel a bit like putting an essay in to your English teacher. You know, \"must try harder\".' (McCourt returns the compliment suggesting that Parker understood the book so well because 'he comes from a blue-collar background and I come from a no-collar background'.) The difficulties of putting McCourt's memoir on film were always likely to be in preventing its sentiment from becoming too mawkish: it begins, brightly, with the death of the author's baby sister and infant twin brothers from a mixture of illness and malnutrition, and then the trouble really starts. Parker succeeds in keeping the grimness in check through perfor mances of great intensity and restraint from Robert Carlyle and Emily Watson, who play McCourt's parents, as well as inspirational, and often comic, debuts by the boys who play the growing Frank (typically Parker auditioned 15,000 children to find the Franks he wanted: 'If you get the casting right, the rest takes care of itself,' he says). Even so, as in the book, the real stars of Angela's Ashes are Poverty and Damp, which stalk the hopes of the ever-optimistic McCourt children like personifications from medieval mystery plays. This is perhaps the wettest film ever made. The rain sweeps in from the Shannon ('the damp heart and silent villain of our story,' as Parker has it). It sluices through the back alleys of Limerick before collecting in big plashy puddles in the McCourts' front room. Ever the craftsman, Parker spent a couple of months at Technicolor, working with a new grading process that holds more of the silver in the print. Thus, as the McCourt family push their soggy belongings in dripping hand carts from one waterlogged basement to another they are bathed in a kind of sepulchral sepia glitter which lends some scenes a monumental pathos (though there are occasional moments, too, when you feel as if you are watching the most lavish Hovis ad ever made).

      "body": "<p>The property market looks in pretty good health. Rents are rising again after a brief dip last year and so are capital values - surveyor Richard Ellis estimates the increase at around 8 per cent a year. </p> <p>So why are some of the leading property companies trading at such low prices? Land Securities currently stands at more than a third below estimates of what its property will be worth at its March year-end; British Land is at a 40 per cent discount; and even Hammerson and Slough Estates, among the more popular with investors, are trading at a fifth below expected net asset values. </p> <p>The low ratings are partly because value investing, or buying shares when they are cheap, has been replaced by growth investing - which, in the past few months, has seemed to mean buying shares because they are outrageously expensive. </p> <p>Companies involved in bricks and mortar - or brewing, engineering, housebuilding, restaurants or virtually anything without a dot.com or a technological gizmo to sell - have been ignored by investors desperately searching out the clicks and mortar companies that seem to double in price every week. Land Securities and British Land, the only two FTSE-100 property stocks, have suffered the biggest falls because their shares are the easiest to trade. </p> <p>But there is more to the falls than Internet mania. Investors are starting to get nervous about two specific parts of the property market: retailers and the City. Land Securities has about half its assets in shops and retail warehouses, while British Land has a similar proportion in City offices, so it is hardly surprising that they have bigger discounts than Slough, whose strength is in trendy industrial warehouses, and Hammerson, which has respected management and a good geographical spread. </p> <p>The question is: has the de-rating gone too far? In the City, the worry is about over-supply - cranes are again much in evidence, and Land Securities is one of those contemplating adding more of its own. High-street retailers are struggling, as the rash of Christmas trading statements expected over the next few weeks is likely to confirm. That is bad news for their shareholders, but it will concern their landlords only if they stop paying their rent - which could well happen. </p> <p>Property analysts at Merrill Lynch say that there are 'real concerns' about the financial viability of some retailers, and signs that some are trying to offload their leases. </p> <p>That includes some of the large ones. Storehouse, the Mothercare and BhS group, and Arcadia, owner of brands including Dorothy Perkins and Burtons, may not be insolvent, but there are real concerns about their futures. Both are seen as takeover targets, and there is no guarantee that a buyer, assuming one can be found, will want all the properties. Finding replacement tenants would be easy in a busy shopping centre, but well-nigh impossible in many high streets. </p> <p>However, the risk of tenant defaults should not be overdone. Even the most pessimistic of forecasters would not suggest that a collapse on the scale seen in the late 1980s is likely: supply has been much more tightly controlled, and the economy is looking robust, notwithstanding rising interest rates. </p> <p>The discounts at British Land and Land Securities are more than twice their historic average: that is too high. </p> <p>But buyers should not expect them to narrow quickly. Technology stocks may have been hit last week, but that does not mean that investors are preparing to rush into old-fashioned cyclicals. Buyers of these must be patient. </p> <p><strong> Signet rings tills</strong><br> </p> <p> Patience has paid off for investors in the Signet jewellery group. An 8.9 per cent rise in sales in the 48 weeks to Christmas and the promise that profits for the full year will be 'well ahead' of expectations is the kind of news the market has been waiting for since James McAdam was shipped in as chairman to tidy up the mess made by his predecessor Gerald Ratner. </p> <p>About the only thing Ratner would now recognise at the chain is the feel-good factor, evident on a scale not seen since his heyday in the 1980s. </p> <p>We are treating ourselves to designer labels, to bigger and better watches, to more diamonds. Signet is cashing in handsomely: in Britain, pre-Christmas sales were up 11.2 per cent, and over the 48 weeks as a whole they rose by 4.5 per cent. </p> <p>In the US, Signet continues to confound those who warn that its sales growth must slow, with another 11.3 per cent like-for-like sales rise. Analysts, already expecting profits to rise from \u00a389.2 million to \u00a3104m, are now expecting at least \u00a3120m - more than a third up on last year. </p> <p>Can the momentum continue? McAdam points to the potential for continuing Signet's US opening programme through its conventional Kay stores in shopping malls and its new Jared format of 'category killer' superstores, both of which he believes could be expanded by at least 100 stores. In Britain, the story remains one of maximising the available space rather than expanding it. The company still has a quarter of its H Samuel stores to refurbish, and should be able to reap further benefits from improvements in design and stock replenishments. </p> <p>The shares have risen strongly in the past six months, jumping again last week. But, based on the upgraded forecasts, they still stand on just 14 times expected earnings. They could have further to go. </p> <p><strong> Bitten by the bug</strong><br> </p> <p> Those who warned that the Internet frenzy of the last six weeks of 1999 could only end in disaster have been partially vindicated by last week's events. Technology stocks were the biggest fallers - ARM Holdings even had to suffer the indignity of being downgraded to 'market performer' (the equivalent of a hold) by Goldman Sachs -and there was some sign of interest in old-fashioned businesses such as engineers and even some retailers. </p> <p>But a week's trading is not enough to mark the start of a new trend. Indeed, the signs are that the falls were virtually the only noticeable side-effect of the millennium bug. Fears about its impact had kept big investors out of the market in the run-up to 1 January, leaving frenzied private investors to set the pace. The return of the serious money has had a calming effect, but it does not mean the technology bubble has burst - yet.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The property market looks in pretty good health. Rents are rising again after a brief dip last year and so are capital values - surveyor Richard Ellis estimates the increase at around 8 per cent a year. So why are some of the leading property companies trading at such low prices? Land Securities currently stands at more than a third below estimates of what its property will be worth at its March year-end; British Land is at a 40 per cent discount; and even Hammerson and Slough Estates, among the more popular with investors, are trading at a fifth below expected net asset values. The low ratings are partly because value investing, or buying shares when they are cheap, has been replaced by growth investing - which, in the past few months, has seemed to mean buying shares because they are outrageously expensive. Companies involved in bricks and mortar - or brewing, engineering, housebuilding, restaurants or virtually anything without a dot.com or a technological gizmo to sell - have been ignored by investors desperately searching out the clicks and mortar companies that seem to double in price every week. Land Securities and British Land, the only two FTSE-100 property stocks, have suffered the biggest falls because their shares are the easiest to trade. But there is more to the falls than Internet mania. Investors are starting to get nervous about two specific parts of the property market: retailers and the City. Land Securities has about half its assets in shops and retail warehouses, while British Land has a similar proportion in City offices, so it is hardly surprising that they have bigger discounts than Slough, whose strength is in trendy industrial warehouses, and Hammerson, which has respected management and a good geographical spread. The question is: has the de-rating gone too far? In the City, the worry is about over-supply - cranes are again much in evidence, and Land Securities is one of those contemplating adding more of its own. High-street retailers are struggling, as the rash of Christmas trading statements expected over the next few weeks is likely to confirm. That is bad news for their shareholders, but it will concern their landlords only if they stop paying their rent - which could well happen. Property analysts at Merrill Lynch say that there are 'real concerns' about the financial viability of some retailers, and signs that some are trying to offload their leases. That includes some of the large ones. Storehouse, the Mothercare and BhS group, and Arcadia, owner of brands including Dorothy Perkins and Burtons, may not be insolvent, but there are real concerns about their futures. Both are seen as takeover targets, and there is no guarantee that a buyer, assuming one can be found, will want all the properties. Finding replacement tenants would be easy in a busy shopping centre, but well-nigh impossible in many high streets. However, the risk of tenant defaults should not be overdone. Even the most pessimistic of forecasters would not suggest that a collapse on the scale seen in the late 1980s is likely: supply has been much more tightly controlled, and the economy is looking robust, notwithstanding rising interest rates. The discounts at British Land and Land Securities are more than twice their historic average: that is too high. But buyers should not expect them to narrow quickly. Technology stocks may have been hit last week, but that does not mean that investors are preparing to rush into old-fashioned cyclicals. Buyers of these must be patient. Signet rings tills Patience has paid off for investors in the Signet jewellery group. An 8.9 per cent rise in sales in the 48 weeks to Christmas and the promise that profits for the full year will be 'well ahead' of expectations is the kind of news the market has been waiting for since James McAdam was shipped in as chairman to tidy up the mess made by his predecessor Gerald Ratner. About the only thing Ratner would now recognise at the chain is the feel-good factor, evident on a scale not seen since his heyday in the 1980s. We are treating ourselves to designer labels, to bigger and better watches, to more diamonds. Signet is cashing in handsomely: in Britain, pre-Christmas sales were up 11.2 per cent, and over the 48 weeks as a whole they rose by 4.5 per cent. In the US, Signet continues to confound those who warn that its sales growth must slow, with another 11.3 per cent like-for-like sales rise. Analysts, already expecting profits to rise from \u00a389.2 million to \u00a3104m, are now expecting at least \u00a3120m - more than a third up on last year. Can the momentum continue? McAdam points to the potential for continuing Signet's US opening programme through its conventional Kay stores in shopping malls and its new Jared format of 'category killer' superstores, both of which he believes could be expanded by at least 100 stores. In Britain, the story remains one of maximising the available space rather than expanding it. The company still has a quarter of its H Samuel stores to refurbish, and should be able to reap further benefits from improvements in design and stock replenishments. The shares have risen strongly in the past six months, jumping again last week. But, based on the upgraded forecasts, they still stand on just 14 times expected earnings. They could have further to go. Bitten by the bug Those who warned that the Internet frenzy of the last six weeks of 1999 could only end in disaster have been partially vindicated by last week's events. Technology stocks were the biggest fallers - ARM Holdings even had to suffer the indignity of being downgraded to 'market performer' (the equivalent of a hold) by Goldman Sachs -and there was some sign of interest in old-fashioned businesses such as engineers and even some retailers. But a week's trading is not enough to mark the start of a new trend. Indeed, the signs are that the falls were virtually the only noticeable side-effect of the millennium bug. Fears about its impact had kept big investors out of the market in the run-up to 1 January, leaving frenzied private investors to set the pace. The return of the serious money has had a calming effect, but it does not mean the technology bubble has burst - yet.",

      "bodyText": "The Millennium Dome is to be sold for up to \u00a3100 million, in a privatisation deal that Ministers believe could rescue it from potential financial disaster. Shaken by the negative publicity from some newspapers last week, Ministers are for the first time privately admitting that sales of tickets may only reach 10 million, two million fewer than projected in the original budget, and representing a financial shortfall of \u00a350m. With 12 different consortiums bidding to take over the Dome, and a short list due to be announced in the next few days, Ministers claim the New Millennium Experience Company is sitting on a substantial asset. A final choice will be made by the Government in the summer. One Minister said: 'We think the building is now one of the most famous and admired in the world. We are going to get a very substantial bid for the building.' Any bidder will have to pay for the building itself, as well as for the land. The building is 13 times bigger than the Royal Albert Hall. The Dome has no unspent contingency fund left in its \u00a3758m budget, making it vulnerable to a cash shortfall if sales do plummet. Alastair Campbell, the Prime Minister's Press Secretary, last week held a special briefing to attack the media for failing to report the alleged popularity of the exhibition with the visiting public. If sales do not rise, Ministers believe they will be saved from financial catastrophe by the competition between commercial consortiums to take over the Dome from 2001. The New Millenium Experience had set aside only \u00a315m in its budget for the disposal of the assets as scrap. All sides accept this figure is ludicrously low. Bids for the Dome include consortiums wanting a venue for a snow dome, Charlton Athletic, a conference centre, a sports stadium, a trade fair exhibition hall, a film theme park and a film studio. Queues and confusion continued to dog the Dome yesterday as opposition politicians lined up to attack the Government on its handling of the affair. Visitors at times faced waits of up to an hour to enter the Body Zone. At one point, staff struggled to manage the queue which crossed the main thoroughfare.",

Lockett had worked for the Tories putting together their conferences. As a nod to the non-party political nature of the millennium celebrations, Mandelson agreed.</p> <p>Last week Lockett flew back from a skiing holiday to wade straight into a blazing row with Jennie Page, chief executive of the new Millennium Experience Company, over who should carry the can for the disasters that plagued the Dome's millennium party. In retrospect the organisers could not have planned a worse public relations disaster if they had tried. For among the hundreds of guests forced to queue for more than three hours in the open with their families at Stratford Tube station in east London, before arriving late for the celebrations, were seven national newspaper editors, along with their wives and children, including the Times's Peter Stothard, the Independent's Simon Kelner, and the Guardian's Alan Rusbridger. Greg Dyke, new director-general of the BBC, was also fuming in the crowd.</p> <p>The fall-out was inevitable. In the week that has followed, the media has transformed a national cock-up into a national disaster, as every columnist worth their salt weighed into Ministers and the management of the Dome.</p> <p>And inevitably too, those involved in the debacle have turned on each other - most furiously, Page and Lockett.</p> <p>As last week's meeting opened, Page was blaming Lockett. Lockett, however, was determined not to be a scapegoat, and as the meeting ended he extracted an admission that the responsibility lay with Page and the NMEC for failing to send out the tickets on time.</p> <p>Page's anger over the debacle was twofold. She was furious not just because senior opinion formers had been forced to stew, but she was also painfully aware of how much first impressions count. If the operation betrayed any sign of incompetence in its first week of opening to the public, an indelible tone would be set. She was right to be worried: press coverage in the Dome's first week proved unrelentingly hostile.</p> <p>Commentator after commentator who visited the Dome wrote scathing pieces.

Even Polly Toynbee, the Guardian columnist who had previously been a strong supporter of the Dome described it as 'a lemon'.</p> <p>Some of this criticism was motivated by revenge. Some editors - furious at the way their Millennium Eve was ruined - had, it appeared, ordered journalists to get 'anti-Dome' stories, a job made easy by continuing teething problems.</p> <p>During the opening weekend, visitors were forced to queue for up to two hours to visit some of the zones, in which they spent only seven minutes. Headlines described it as 'the Disaster Zone', and just six days after the Dome opened, the Times - whose editor was one of those kept waiting - ran a page one splash, headed: 'Dome tickets flop forces big relaunch'.</p> <p>With so many political reputations riding on it, the nervousness is now palpable in Whitehall. The Dome's difficulties have become entwined with more intractable political issues. If the project proves a monstrous waste of money as heart patients die for lack of an NHS bed, Labour's hard-earned reputation for reading the popular mood will take a body blow.</p> <p>Already, there are indications that it could become a wider liability. A poll in the Economist last week suggested 56 per cent of voters now believe the Government was wrong to build the Dome, and only 35 per cent think it was right.</p> <p>Tony Blair cannot distance himself from the project. While he may have been uncertain about whether to press ahead with the Tories' grandiose visison, his own reputation is now intimately linked to the Dome's success.

The Dome has become the ultimate Blairite big tent. Anyone from its original Tory enthusiast, Michael Heseltine, the journalist Simon Jenkins, Bob Ayling, head of British Airways, Sam Chisolm, Michael Grade, the PR expert Mathew Freud, film-maker David Puttnam and Alan Yentob, the BBC executive, were persuaded to give time to make the Dome a success.</p> <p>British big business has put its shareholders' cash on the line by sponsoring the zones.

In a fraught exchange, Page refused seven times to tell journalists how many tickets had been sold, nor how many they hoped to sell, but urged journalists to trust her that they were soaring above target.</p> <p>The truth, according to one source, is this. The Dome got 52,000 visitors in the first week, around 17,000 a day. By midweek that had fallen to just over 12,000. Even the queue-ridden figure of 17,000 is only about half the level the organisers need to reach each day through the year to meet their 12 million sales target. And Ministers insisted at the outset that the only test for the Dome was sales, not critical acclaim.</p> <p>That target of 12m ticket sales was based on judgments about the popularity of other comparable days out. To achieve this, the company reckoned it would need 226 'short days' in which the site would be open from 10am to 6pm and 140 long days when the site would be open from 10am to 11pm. At the maximum there would be a daily throughput of 35, 000 visitors staying for an between four and seven hours. Once inside, each would spend \u00a34 a head on merchandise.</p> <p>The managers may have promised to tackle the queues, but they said they would do little to meet the complaints about the content, insisting that most members of the public were happy. They would keep the zones under review to make sure they were exciting. But while they may be 'tweaked', any significant changes to meet the critics' charges that it was 'a lemon' have been ruled out.</p> <p>But the complaints about the Dome are not confined to irritated newspaper editors and some members of the public. Far from taking pride in their work, many of those who worked on the Dome are also unimpressed with the end result.'It's all pretty mediocre,' said one Dome adviser. 'The Natural History Museum is more fun.'</p> <p>Peter Higgins of Land Design managed to turn the Play Zone into one of the few obvious highlights, but he is critical of many of the other zones, as well as of the public areas between where visitors spend most of their time.</p> <p>'No one has designed the common spaces.

'The architecture and design quality could have been much better.</p> <p>'The Millennium Company controlled too much of the process so the design team was limited in what they can do. They didn't really care about the architecture or design.'</p> <p>Jiricna's brief was particularly tough because of the compromises inevitable in dealing with such a sensitive issue as religion.

They have patiently queued for ages on the promise of a once-in-a-lifetime experience: the spectacle of a Prime Minister voluntarily deciding to share his power with another party.

Labour's tribalist tendency talk confidently of killing electoral reform forever - 'it's dead in the water' gloats the MP Fraser Kemp - at the autumn party conference. I expect Mr Blair to resist that. Never a man to make a decision immediately if it can be postponed until later, the Prime Minister may be in need of the Lib Dems some day. 'The Project is not dead,' says one of the few members of the Cabinet who has always believed in it. 'It drifts.'</p> <p>The long-term Project has been a victim of its author's short-term success. It was never going to be easy to persuade a party with a majority of 180 that it needed to change the winner-takes-all system, and even less so when Labour is so assured of a second term in government. My Lord Jenkins and Captain Ashdown convinced themselves that they had privately converted the Prime Minister to electoral reform, but I suspect he was never quite as sure of his mind as they were. He did not want to say never to his Lib Dem friends, but nor did he ever quite say now. His lukewarmness to electoral reform has been further doused by the experience of Government. During the Kosovo War, the British Prime Minister, unlike most of his continental counterparts, did not have to consult a coali tion partner whenever he wanted to order a bombing run. Never under-estimate the shaping impact of wars on Prime Ministers. The war over Kosovo also turned Blair against Freedom of Information when he learnt from Bill Clinton that the Pentagon would put nothing sensitive on paper for fear of disclosure to the public.</p> <p>The horse-trading with the Lib Dems in the Scottish Parliament and the elections to the European Parliament have also been seized upon by Labour's first-past-the-posters as damnations of electoral reform. They conveniently forget that PR was used in Scotland to make it next to impossible for the Nationalists ever to gain a majority in Edinburgh. Labour may be grateful for it after the next elections in Scotland. They deliberately overlook that, under first-past-the-post, Labour would have won even fewer seats in the European Parliament.</p> <p>They may not have the facts, but the first-past-the-posters do command the numbers. As Labour has become hotter for ruling in glorious isolation, so the Liberal Democrats have become cooler about co-operation. Charles Kennedy will keep talking in the hope of extracting the consolation of electoral reform for local government. But the Liberal Democrats will increasingly define themselves less by their relationship with the Government, and more by their differences with it.</p> <p>Members of Kennedy's party - and not just them - are wondering how much progress can be expected of a New Labour dominated century which begins with the curtailment of the right to trial by jury. In a tacit acknowledgement that his profile has so far been grass-hugging, tomorrow Charles Kennedy will begin a national tour campaigning on the core theme that there should be no more income tax cuts until public services have improved. He begins in Norfolk. Very flat, Norfolk. Like Mr Kennedy's polling ratings. The Lib Dem leader needs to raise his game, and give it bite, and he must do both urgently.</p> <p>It will be invigorating for the Liberal Democrats, and healthier for democratic argument, when New Labour is challenged more aggressively by a party crusading for social justice and liberal values. Yet you can't help but notice that the people who are really delighted by the stalling of the Lab-Lib Project are shrewd Tories. William Hague's most sterling service to the Conservative Party is to lead such a hopeless Opposition that he has lulled Labour into complacency about changing the voting system. Though first-past-the-post massacred the Tories at the last election, it has otherwise served Conservatives tremendously well and progressives extremely woefully.</p> <p>The Labour Party celebrates its hundredth birthday next month. The vital statistic to concentrate on is that, of all those years, it has spent just 22 of them in office. There will come a time when even this Government begins to get intimations of its own mortality. One of the minority of the Cabinet who combines sympathy for changing the system with the ability to take the large and long view believes that interest in electoral reform will revive 'in the second term when we face some real electoral adversity'. It is obviously likely that changing the voting system will suddenly have more appeal - even perhaps to John Prescott and Jack Straw - when they are staring into the eyes of defeat. The trouble with this calculation is that unpopular governments don't usually win referendums.</p> <p>This is the Catch-22 of electoral reform. So long as Labour is popular, then the party will not be animated by the idea of altering the rules of the game. When Labour becomes unpopular, it will struggle to convince the people that the system should be changed. The time to have been surest was soon after New Labour came to power. As the sand dribbles through the glass, Tony Blair takes the risk that his radical twenty-first century will prove to be no more enduring than his benighted Dome.</p>",

There will come a time when even this Government begins to get intimations of its own mortality. One of the minority of the Cabinet who combines sympathy for changing the system with the ability to take the large and long view believes that interest in electoral reform will revive 'in the second term when we face some real electoral adversity'. It is obviously likely that changing the voting system will suddenly have more appeal - even perhaps to John Prescott and Jack Straw - when they are staring into the eyes of defeat. The trouble with this calculation is that unpopular governments don't usually win referendums. This is the Catch-22 of electoral reform. So long as Labour is popular, then the party will not be animated by the idea of altering the rules of the game. When Labour becomes unpopular, it will struggle to convince the people that the system should be changed. The time to have been surest was soon after New Labour came to power. As the sand dribbles through the glass, Tony Blair takes the risk that his radical twenty-first century will prove to be no more enduring than his benighted Dome.",

As Aitken settles into his first week of tagged freedom, dozens of creditors are demanding to meet him to discuss repaying his \u00a32.5 million debts - a challenge he has studiously avoided for two years.</p> <p>Although no one would dare assert that Aitken, who once had personal wealth of \u00a33m, has deliberately misled and defrauded his creditors, a series of shrewd moves in recent months has ensured that not a penny of what he owes has yet been paid. He claims to have assets of a mere \u00a340,000, yet he currently lives in a \u00a31.8m house, drives a \u00a320,000 Jeep, has two children at private schools and manages to get by on an income of \u00a311,000 per month.</p> <p>He can also look forward to a pension of more than \u00a3500,000 in just two years time. Unless, of course, a group of creditors succeed in seizing that money as well.</p> <p>The story of Aitken's sudden impoverishment began in August 1998 as his libel trial against The Guardian began to collapse. His wife of 20 years, Lolicia, appeared to be getting on well with him and had appeared at his side during the case. Suddenly she travelled to Switzerland and filed for divorce. Aitken agreed immediately and, in an unprecedentedly amicable settlement, handed over everything. Houses, antiques, paintings, land in Australia. All his belongings, bar a few personal items, now belonged to her.</p> <p>Another property in Sandwich, Kent, worth more than \u00a3500,000, had been earmarked by the creditors. This turned out to be registered in the name of a Panamanian company. It was sold, but the money was said to have been returned to Aitken's mother-in-law who he said had originally purchased it as a gift. A \u00a3300,000 flat in Westminster, which many believed Aitken owned, turned out to have been taken over by his mother. Even his Jeep was registered in his wife's name.</p> <p>But it is the house in Lord North Street, Aitken's home since 1959, which has been the focus of most attention. When a High Court judge granted an injunction to prevent it being transferred to Lolicia, despite the divorce, Aitken announced that the money to purchase the freehold had been provided by Lolicia's late father. Therefore it really belonged to her, even though he continued to live there. At the same time, the judge agreed to raise Aitken's living expenses from \u00a34,000 per month to \u00a311,000 - all the money being realised from the same assets that are currently in dispute.</p> <p>With no way to make claims against his major assets, bankruptcy trustees were forced to go after small fry. Rare books, including a 38-volume edition of Winston Churchill's writings and personally inscribed works by Henry Kissinger and Richard Nixon, were taken from the Westminster home and sold, raising around \u00a38,000.</p> <p>Nine boxes of letters stored at his London office could have been worth around \u00a3100,000 if sold to the media. Although Mr Justice Rattee blocked the sale of the correspondence, branding it 'repugnant' and 'a gross invasion of privacy', the trustees were able to look through the letters to see if they revealed details of any hidden bank accounts or assets. The details of the papers have not been made public.</p> <p>Legal moves continued to access large amounts, and Aitken then made an offer to pay \u00a3840,000 at some point in the future to his main creditors, the Guardian and Granada TV, but offered no security. There was nothing to guarantee the money would be forthcoming, and a significant proportion of it was dependent on 'future literary earnings'. The offer was rejected. Finally, when Aitken could stall his creditors no more, he declared himself bankrupt, just a few days after he spent more than \u00a34,000 on his daughter's eighteenth birthday party.</p> <p>Aitken also faces claims on his two pensions - a private one worth around \u00a3300,000 and his \u00a3250,000 MP's pension. Under insolvency law, trustees in a bankruptcy case are entitled to make a claim for a proportion of the lump sum payable when a pension matures. If they are granted access to both funds, this could be worth more than \u00a3150,000.</p> <p>As to who actually owns the Westminster house, the question will go before a judge - but even that course of action may be delayed for at least a year. Aitken's 17-year-old son, William, still spends some of his time living at the Westminster home. Under current insolvency law, a trustee cannot realise a house if a person under 18 is living there.</p> <p>Despite having agreed to such a harsh divorce settlement, Aitken remains in regular, amicable telephone contact with Lolicia, who is seen at glamorous society events throughout Europe. She currently lives in Cossenay, a village north of Lausanne in Switzerland, but also has homes in Paris and Monaco. She has told friends that her life has never been better. Now going under the name of Mme Aitken-Azucki, she has not set foot in Britain for more than a year. If she did, she would almost certainly be interviewed by police about her role in providing false witness statements to back up her husband's lies during the libel case.</p>",

'You then inject the cells with red dye, and this should be taken up by the lysosomes.</p> <p>'The cells will remain clear. But if the worm has to pass through a lot of polluted soil, its lysosomes fill up, and there is no room for dye - which then spills out into the rest of the cell. Cells that quickly turn red therefore show that a worm has been burrowing throught polluted land.</p> <p>'Worms live in soil all their lives, they eat it and tunnel it.

'In the presence of pollutants, bacteria become unhealthy, and they lose their glow,' added her colleague, Dr Elaine Boyd. Firstly, a sample of soil is taken from a site. Then it is mixed with the glowing bacteria. Shiny, happy bacteria, which continue to emit light, indicate that the land is clean. Dim ones show that the soil is polluted. 'We can also tell what type of pollution is causing the problem,' added Killham. 'For instance, if we blast samples of contaminated soil with air, and this clears off the pollutant, we know that a volatile chemical must be involved. Typically such pollutants are made in paint production plants.' Bugs are not the only unlikely sensor to which scientists have turned in their battle to fight pollution, however. Institute scientists have also recruited another biological ally: worms. To exploit them, researchers led by Dr Claus Svendsen remove a few cells - using a syringe - from worms dug up at a site to be tested for contamination. 'Tiny bodies called lysosomes act as rubbish bags inside a cell,' said Svendsen. 'You then inject the cells with red dye, and this should be taken up by the lysosomes. 'The cells will remain clear. But if the worm has to pass through a lot of polluted soil, its lysosomes fill up, and there is no room for dye - which then spills out into the rest of the cell. Cells that quickly turn red therefore show that a worm has been burrowing throught polluted land. 'Worms live in soil all their lives, they eat it and tunnel it. You couldn't have a better indicator of the health of a piece of land.'",

'The FBI estimate up to 140 guns were posted to Ireland as a result of this operation,' he said, adding that an American citizen who was arrested, but released without charge in Ireland as part of a joint FBI/Gardai operation, had earlier been in the former Yugoslavia. William Flint, with drug-related convictions in the US, was arrested after making mobile phone calls from a hotel in Co Galway to Jacqueline McIntyre, Claxton's girlfriend. McIntyre was charged by gardai with importing six pistols and 120 rounds of ammunition into Ireland from the US. She was released on IR\u00a320,000 bail. Federal sources say Flint's passport showed he had been in the former Yugoslavia before visiting Ireland in July, when the US was still at war with Belgrade. After the Florida arrests, the IRA Army Council said it had not sanctioned the arms plot. The Florida trial comes as Ulster unionists wait to see if the IRA will decommission some arms for the Northern Ireland Executive to survive.",

      "bodyText": "The chief suspect in the murder of the Northern Ireland lawyer Rosemary Nelson has been arrested in the United States after firearms and drug offences. The former Loyalist Volunteer Force member was allowed to flee the province with his family at the end of 1999 after a dispute inside the terrorist group. He was arrested in San Diego, California, after neighbours complained about guns being fired in the garden of his house, loyalist sources in his home town, Portadown, told The Observer. Police who searched the house found gun, ammunition and drugs. The former LVF terrorist was arrested with his wife and another Portadown loyalist following the searches. His two children have been taken into care. He has been in the US since the LVF faction-fighting. The suspect, who is the brother of a former LVF leader, feared for his life following a coup late last year in the organisation that saw several prisoners recently released from the Maze take control of the group. The new leaders were incensed that the fugitive had allowed his members to carry out a pipe-bomb attack on the home of Elisabeth O'Neill, a Catholic woman married to a Protestant on a loyalist estate. The LVF's founder, the late Billy 'King Rat' Wright had ordered that no one was to harm the O'Neill family. The runaway was seen as a danger to the organisation's ceasefire, which had led to its prisoners receiving early releases under the Good Friday Agreement. A police inquiry team headed by Colin Port, Deputy Chief Constable of Norfolk, wants to question him about the murder of Nelson near her home in Lurgan last March. They believe he placed a bomb under her car moments after she drove away from her house. The bombing of the solicitor, who defended many Catholic suspects, prompted immediate allegations of security force collusion in the killing. The revelation that the chief suspect is in custody in the US comes after the murdered woman's family criticised the decision of the Director of Public Prosecutions not to have RUC officers charged over allegations that they threatened her life. The DPP's decision - confirmed yesterday - was made after a long-running investigation by the Independent Commission for Police Complaints into claims about the threats. After her murder it was revealed that the RUC had been pulled off the investigation into these allegations nine months before she was killed and replaced by a team of officers draw entirely from English forces. Nelson's husband, Paul, called yesterday for an independent judicial inquiry into her murder. 'The decision by the DPP is another body blow for our family,' he said. 'Nearly 10 months after her death, there is no sign of any commitment to truth or justice for Rosemary. Tony Blair must recognise his responsibility and order the inquiry.' Robbie McVeigh, from the Rosemary Nelson Campaign, said: 'The sooner we move to an independent international judicial inquiry into the circumstances of the murder the better.' The small, anti-ceasefire Red Hand Defenders terror group admitted responsibility for the murder, but informed loyalist sources said the only organisation capable of building the booby-trap bomb used was the Ulster Defence Association. It is thought UDA members from Belfast built it, and it was then passed to the LVF. The device was similar to bombs used by the UDA in attacks on republican targets and fellow loyalists.",

      "bodyText": "Britain was on the brink of war with the Soviet Union in the winter of 1968 after Ministers became convinced that the Russian President, Leonid Brezhnev, was about to invade Romania. Secret documents released by the Public Record Office yesterday show that, in September 1968, Prime Minister Harold Wilson made detailed contingency plans for military intervention in eastern Europe. Ministers were afraid that the crushing of the 'Prague Spring' - the popular uprising in Czechoslovakia - would lead to the extension of direct Soviet control into neighbouring Romania and even Yugoslavia, seen as the strategic heart of Europe. Romanian President, Nicolae Ceausescu had condemned the Soviet action in Czechoslovakia and it was thought that Moscow was preparing to teach him a lesson. Minutes from meetings at the time record Defence Secretary Denis Healey telling Wilson that Britain could not 'stand idly by' if the Soviet Union continued its expansion. A telex from Foreign Secretary Michael Stewart, made public for the first time, shows that towards the end of 1968, Britain believed that Soviet tanks were about to enter Romania. Intelligence sources even put a date - 22 November - on the invasion. Tony Benn, who as Minister of Technology visited President Ceausescu in June 1968 and remained in contact with Romanian ministers, said last night: 'I had no idea these discussions were going on. But there was a lot of Cold War panic at the time.' Harold Wilson's biographer, Ben Pimlott, said: 'There were fears and anxieties at the time about a possible invasion of Romania. But no one had any idea that the Government had intelligence about the exact date it was due to happen.' Plans to send crack British troops to the Balkans were hatched at a secret meeting between Wilson, Healey and Stewart on 6 September 1968. If a 'direct threat' were made to Yugoslavia, Healey planned to arm Yugoslav guerrillas and send crack British Army units of the sort used during the Second World War to aid partisans. According to the minutes of the meeting, Healey 'agreed with the Prime Minister that a Russian invasion of Romania could well be the first stage towards the establishment of such a threat.' Wilson suggested a build-up of force in the Mediterranean under the cover of military exercises. 'There could be an exercise by the ACE Mobile Force, some form of \"alert\" measures or an increase in the number of British ships in the area, especially in Malta and Cyprus.' 1968 was a year of high tension for governments on both sides of the Iron Curtain. In Paris, an alliance of students and workers had come close to bringing down the French government and in the United States opposition to the Vietnam War reached its height after the massacre of women and children at My Lai by American soldiers.

Greece and Turkey would be left vulnerable, and the entire Eastern Mediterranean would be threatened. Soviet troops in Yugoslavia and Nato troops in Italy would face each other across the Adriatic. The next day Healey used even more apocalyptic language, saying that if Nato did not oppose further Soviet expansion it would encourage Russia 'to move against such countries as Finland, Sweden, Iran and possibly even members of the alliance such as Greece and Turkey'. Throughout September, Wilson and Stewart entered a series of desperate talks with Ceausescu. Soviet troop movements on the Romanian border were beginning to cause serious concern in London and Washington.

The composition of the Polish contingent: one tank battalion, two airborne battalions, six signal companies, three military police companies, two airborne regiments.' Three days later, Stewart sent an urgent telex to Bucharest: 'We have assessed the most recent information available to us and have concluded that the Russians are making preparations for very early military action against Romania.' Here the Public Record Office file ends, without revealing how close Europe came to war in 1968 or why the Soviets called off the invasion at the last minute. Pimlott believes it was a defining moment of the twentieth century. 'Russia's decision not to invade Romania was the slippery slope towards the end of the Cold War. It is possibly even more significant than the decision not to crush Solidarity in Poland.'",

      "bodyText": "Kate Hoey, the Sports Minister, is backing plans by the Football Association and Premiership to tackle homophobia. A meeting later this month to discuss the issue could lead to the FA adopting a code of practice and introducing the subject as part of a development programme for young players. Unlike other high-profile areas, such as the pop and movie industry, top-level footballers who admit to their homosexuality are rare. The most famous example in this country was Justin Fashanu, the former Norwich and Nottingham Forest footballer, who committed suicide in 1998. But Stonewall, a gay pressure group, has been in discussions with the FA and Premiership about the topic in an attempt to make it easier for footballers to come out. 'I know of a number of closeted gay footballers but because of the way the issue is treated in this country they do not wish that to be known,' said John Miskelly, the chairman of Stonewall and an Arsenal season ticket holder. The discussions started last year after the row that followed the clash between Graeme Le Saux and Robbie Fowler when the Liverpool player made lewd gestures. 'The government is extremely supportive and determined to stamp out homophobia,' said Miskelly. 'Homophobia in football has never been tackled before. There is no learning or development of kids which even brings it on to their agenda.' Stonewall has suggested making homophobia a module on the FA's youth development scheme and introducing a code of conduct on the issue. Hoey said: 'The government has acted firmly in the past and recent legislation has gone a long way to eliminating racist chanting. Homophobia is equally distasteful and the efforts of Stonewall and the FA are to be welcomed.'",

      "body": "<p>Poor Mark Wallinger. Poor Jesus Christ up on his lonely plinth with only the pigeons, traffic and tourists for company. Wallinger's Christ, Ecce Homo, has been occupying the fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square since last July and has certainly endeared himself to me as well as to many more serious people, but his future looks uncertain. He will definitely come down in February, to be replaced by Bill Woodrow's bronze Regardless of History, showing a head crushed by a book, which will be replaced in turn next autumn by Rachel Whiteread's upside-down cast of the plinth.</p> <p>The fourth plinth has been empty since l84l when Charles Barry designed Trafalgar Square. He meant it to be for William IV but there was no money to fund the project, so the square has had to get along with just George lV and two generals - Napier and Havelock - until five years ago, when Prue Leith, as deputy chair of the Royal Society of Arts, launched a campaign to fill the empty plinth.</p> <p>But now a committee chaired by Sir John Mortimer, and including such well-known art experts as Ruth Rendell, is beavering away to determine what - or probably whose - statue the public wants to see installed permanently. The current favourite seems to be Nelson Mandela, but there are strong lobbies for everyone from Princess Diana to Captain Cook to 'all the animals killed in war'.</p> <p>What will happen, of course, is that these deliberations will continue until the Queen Mother dies, whereupon the nation will rise with one voice and shout: 'We want the Queen Mother!' And then some truly terrible sculptor - because, let's face it, the art of portrait statuary is not exactly booming in this country - will be commissioned to produce her likeness, hat and wafty bits and all. (Apparently, there is some arcane rule that you can't have statues of royals while they are alive, though surely that rule never applied to Queen Victoria?)</p> <p>Either way, it's a poor lookout and the point of this article is to say: 'Look, Wallinger's Christ might not be the most exciting statue ever seen but it's certainly one of the best we've got in London, so why not keep it?'</p> <p>But even Mark Wallinger doesn't believe there's much hope of that happening. In fact, he feels thoroughly cheated. He thought when he was one of 20 contemporary artists invited to submit ideas for the plinth that it was a straightforward competition and the winner would be installed permanently.</p> <p>But suddenly it became a hot political potato and the Great British Public had to be consulted. Since when has the GBP ever given a toss about art? They probably hadn't even noticed that there was a plinth going begging till the papers told them. But now, of course, the fourth plinth has become a political soapbox for every posturing philistine in town.</p> <p>Admittedly, neither Wallinger nor Christ are obvious choices to fill the plinth, but all the better for that. He is a quirky, intelligent, 40-year-old artist who, though Goldsmith's-trained and Saatchi-owned, doesn't quite fit in the Britart mould. He first impinged on public notice in l995 when he was nominated for the Turner Prize, but lost to Damien Hirst.</p> <p>His work until then was mainly about class, power and nationality (it featured, among other things, a real racehorse called A Real Work of Art) but since then he has moved on to religious themes, most memorably a video called Angel shot in Angel Tube station. This featured him as a blind man 'speaking in tongues' - reciting St John's Gospel backwards - while walking down an up escalator. This is a terribly crass description of a complex and haunting work but it would takes pages to explain it.</p> <p>Anyway, he says that as soon as he got the phone call asking him to submit ideas for the fourth plinth, he thought immediately of Christ. 'For the last couple of years, I've been making work that uses Christian imagery and is to do with faith and illusion, so a Jesus figure was such an obvious idea; I felt it was a sort of conduit for something. It struck me, too, that it's the millennium and yet everyone's rather squeamish about mentioning Christianity, which seems odd. I mean, they have beacons all around the country saying British Gas. I don't quite see where the ethical line is being drawn!'</p> <p>He chose the Ecce Homo moment because it seemed to fit Trafalgar Square's associations with crowds and political demonstrations. ('Ecce Homo - behold the man' - were the words with which Pontius Pilate handed Christ over to the mob.) 'Essentially, I wanted to make a piece that had Christ as a human being, at a point of the story where he isn't a deity, he's just a guy being handed over to the lynch mob. I wanted something that reflected back on issues to do with power. And I wanted him to be lifesize because, well, He was made in our image.'</p> <p>Wallinger's first maquette was of a more traditional Christ, with long hair, beard and dhoti-like loincloth, but he decided in the end to go for a modern Christ, beardless, shaven-headed and with more of a towel. I must say the towel seems to me the statue's one failure - it belongs to the Hollywood Pharaonic era or even the modern YMCA gym era rather than first century Judaea - and Wallinger concedes the loincloth was almost the most difficult decision he had to make. 'I wanted a contemporary Christ, shorn of hair, but at the same time I couldn't have him wearing boxer shorts! It's quite a tricky one, really.'</p> <p>Some people have complained that the towel makes Christ look gay, but Wallinger is dismissive: 'Yeah, well... if you want someone looking fairly trim and only wearing a loincloth, he will tend to look a bit gay. But it's nowhere near as blatant as, say, Michelangelo's Christ in Rome - a very lovingly carved bottom. I was quite aware that that might happen but there's not a lot I could do about it. And I don't know that we can presume anything about His sexuality anyway.'</p> <p>He wanted to make the figure look like marble, in contrast to the black bronzes around it, and found a casting studio near High Wycombe that could produce the requisite material, a sanded polyester resin that is more durable than marble because it is completely non-porous. He thought he would have to audition actors to find his Christ, but the studio came up with one of its own employees, an apprentice called Christopher Welch, who was used to modelling for casts, a hideous job involving straws in the nostrils.</p> <p>Wallinger was rather embarrassed when Welch, on their first meeting, instantly stripped down to his boxer shorts, but then delighted to notice that he was wearing a crucifix. At first, Wallinger posed him with his hands bound in front, but from some angles he looked like a footballer clutching his goolies while facing a direct free kick. So then he posed him with his hands tied behind, which proved much more effective, giving him the slightly bowed shoulders, which are one of the most moving aspects of the statue.</p> <p>Wallinger's is a modest, unassuming Christ, looking tiny and vulnerable on the edge of his eight-metre plinth, in fact a Christ as we are unused to seeing him, neither a baby in his mother's arms nor a torture victim on the cross, but an ordinary, apprehensive young man. The very modesty of the statue's pose and scale gives it an extraordinary power over its surroundings. As Richard Dorment wrote in the Telegraph: 'What Wallinger has really done is to turn Trafalgar Square into something akin to a meditation on the transience of earthly things.'</p> <p>The statue has been warmly received by Christians and has twice been the subject of sermons on Radio 4's 'Thought for the Day'. Richard Chartres, the Bishop of London, said he found it 'profoundly moving' and Vincent Nichols, the Catholic Bishop of Westminster, found it 'humbling and affecting'. The Queen's Chaplain wrote to Wallinger saying that he had always had trouble imagining Christ as an ordinary man, and this was an important step for his faith.</p> <p>But Wallinger is wary of being hailed as a 'Christian artist' and very reluctant to talk about his own beliefs. He describes himself as a former atheist, now an agnostic. At all events, he certainly takes his Christ seriously - there is no element of irony in the work.</p> <p>For Wallinger, his first venture into public sculpture has been a disheartening experience. At what should have been his proudest moment when the statue was unveiled, he was being interviewed by the BBC and told that 'some people are saying it should be a statue of Posh Spice and David Beckham'. For weeks, he was 'a bit of a basket case. I realised I'd been running on adrenaline for I don't know how long and I was really quite depressed'.</p> <p>He didn't revisit the statue for two months and when he did, he bumped into some people he knew 'and that made me feel like a sort of sad type hanging around'. Moreover, he was annoyed to find that the sign under the statue explaining that there was a visitors' book for comments at Canada House had got ripped off (though it has now been replaced). He is also disappointed that, although the statue has received plenty of media attention as a news item, it has not been seriously reviewed in the art press.</p> <p>So what will happen to the statue now? There have been inquiries from Milan Cathedral and one or two other places, but he designed it for Trafalgar Square and very much wants it to stay there. Of course, it has to come down while the Woodrow and Whiteread works are shown, but he hopes it won't then be forgotten. He is indignant at the idea of a committee with no practising artists on it deciding his fate - 'I can't imagine a major literary prize being chaired by two sculptors' - and recalls going to one committee meeting where Bernie Grant and a black lady peer attacked him for showing a white Christ; they said they wanted 'a contrite piece about the slave trade'. 'How on earth you realise that I don't know,' he snorts. 'It wasn't helped by the fact that they kept saying it was in front of the Tate Gallery.'</p> <p>His money is on the Queen Mother as the final choice, but he won't bother to disguise his anger. 'When they first approached me, there was a considerable enticement that at the end of the day there might be a possibility that the statue would be installed there permanently. So I made it in all sincerity in those terms, but now people make it sound like a sort of shifting circus.'</p> <p>Anyway, if you agree with Wallinger that the statue should stay, write a note to that effect in the visitors' book in Canada House or write to Sir John Mortimer c/o the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, 2-4 Cockspur Street, London SWlY FDH or e-mail <a href=\"http://www.sculpture.org.uk/fourthplinth\" target=\"_NEW\">www.sculpture.org.uk/fourthplinth</a>.</p>",

'I wanted a contemporary Christ, shorn of hair, but at the same time I couldn't have him wearing boxer shorts! It's quite a tricky one, really.' Some people have complained that the towel makes Christ look gay, but Wallinger is dismissive: 'Yeah, well... if you want someone looking fairly trim and only wearing a loincloth, he will tend to look a bit gay. But it's nowhere near as blatant as, say, Michelangelo's Christ in Rome - a very lovingly carved bottom. I was quite aware that that might happen but there's not a lot I could do about it. And I don't know that we can presume anything about His sexuality anyway.' He wanted to make the figure look like marble, in contrast to the black bronzes around it, and found a casting studio near High Wycombe that could produce the requisite material, a sanded polyester resin that is more durable than marble because it is completely non-porous. He thought he would have to audition actors to find his Christ, but the studio came up with one of its own employees, an apprentice called Christopher Welch, who was used to modelling for casts, a hideous job involving straws in the nostrils. Wallinger was rather embarrassed when Welch, on their first meeting, instantly stripped down to his boxer shorts, but then delighted to notice that he was wearing a crucifix. At first, Wallinger posed him with his hands bound in front, but from some angles he looked like a footballer clutching his goolies while facing a direct free kick. So then he posed him with his hands tied behind, which proved much more effective, giving him the slightly bowed shoulders, which are one of the most moving aspects of the statue. Wallinger's is a modest, unassuming Christ, looking tiny and vulnerable on the edge of his eight-metre plinth, in fact a Christ as we are unused to seeing him, neither a baby in his mother's arms nor a torture victim on the cross, but an ordinary, apprehensive young man. The very modesty of the statue's pose and scale gives it an extraordinary power over its surroundings. As Richard Dorment wrote in the Telegraph: 'What Wallinger has really done is to turn Trafalgar Square into something akin to a meditation on the transience of earthly things.' The statue has been warmly received by Christians and has twice been the subject of sermons on Radio 4's 'Thought for the Day'. Richard Chartres, the Bishop of London, said he found it 'profoundly moving' and Vincent Nichols, the Catholic Bishop of Westminster, found it 'humbling and affecting'. The Queen's Chaplain wrote to Wallinger saying that he had always had trouble imagining Christ as an ordinary man, and this was an important step for his faith. But Wallinger is wary of being hailed as a 'Christian artist' and very reluctant to talk about his own beliefs. He describes himself as a former atheist, now an agnostic. At all events, he certainly takes his Christ seriously - there is no element of irony in the work. For Wallinger, his first venture into public sculpture has been a disheartening experience. At what should have been his proudest moment when the statue was unveiled, he was being interviewed by the BBC and told that 'some people are saying it should be a statue of Posh Spice and David Beckham'. For weeks, he was 'a bit of a basket case. I realised I'd been running on adrenaline for I don't know how long and I was really quite depressed'. He didn't revisit the statue for two months and when he did, he bumped into some people he knew 'and that made me feel like a sort of sad type hanging around'. Moreover, he was annoyed to find that the sign under the statue explaining that there was a visitors' book for comments at Canada House had got ripped off (though it has now been replaced). He is also disappointed that, although the statue has received plenty of media attention as a news item, it has not been seriously reviewed in the art press. So what will happen to the statue now? There have been inquiries from Milan Cathedral and one or two other places, but he designed it for Trafalgar Square and very much wants it to stay there. Of course, it has to come down while the Woodrow and Whiteread works are shown, but he hopes it won't then be forgotten. He is indignant at the idea of a committee with no practising artists on it deciding his fate - 'I can't imagine a major literary prize being chaired by two sculptors' - and recalls going to one committee meeting where Bernie Grant and a black lady peer attacked him for showing a white Christ; they said they wanted 'a contrite piece about the slave trade'. 'How on earth you realise that I don't know,' he snorts. 'It wasn't helped by the fact that they kept saying it was in front of the Tate Gallery.' His money is on the Queen Mother as the final choice, but he won't bother to disguise his anger. 'When they first approached me, there was a considerable enticement that at the end of the day there might be a possibility that the statue would be installed there permanently. So I made it in all sincerity in those terms, but now people make it sound like a sort of shifting circus.' Anyway, if you agree with Wallinger that the statue should stay, write a note to that effect in the visitors' book in Canada House or write to Sir John Mortimer c/o the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, 2-4 Cockspur Street, London SWlY FDH or e-mail www.sculpture.org.uk/fourthplinth.",

Physical separation of nanny/child from husband may not be feasible if your house is of average size. But it might be possible to delineate the use of certain rooms at certain times, and to outline an approximate timetable so that the kitchen will be empty when they are out walking, and so on. If the present situation is unsalvageable these things could be thought out for the next time. Perhaps more importantly, he could then be charged with the process of nanny selection. Do you trust him enough to do this? It would be revealing to put this proposal to him now and gauge the reaction. You then face the possibility that you might disagree profoundly about the next employee. Total domestic harmony is the ideal. But if the reasons for his dislike are nebulous, and if she stays the course, you should hang in there a bit longer. Your instincts over child care are better honed than his, and your daughter's well-being comes before his amour-propre. He may just have to adjust. Reader's responses I can appreciate how your husband feels. It must be very irritating to have the presence of another person in the house. Would it be possible to work out a weekly rota so when he is in the house, she can be out with your daughter at playgroup or doing a daily trip to the park or shopping? At least then your husband would know when she will be in the house and when she won't and not feel so intimidated. It might ease the strain of listening trying to guess if she is in or out. L.A. of Notting Hill, London I certainly do not wish to put a spanner in the works or arouse suspicions and I could be completely wrong, but do you think your husband might have had an affair with this nanny and now wants her out of the house? This would account for his 'obsessiveness' about the issue and he might be desperate to get rid of her in case she lets slip their guilty secret. Y.R. of Catford, London Next week's dilemma is from Anon of Dorset My husband has suffered from chronic clinical depression for many years. I have always sympathised with him and learned to live with his bleak moods. However, recently he has got worse. Although he knows he has got a problem, he will not seek medical advice and thinks his depression would instantly lift if certain problems were sorted out. I know this is not the case. He needs medical help but will not recognise this or seek help. What can I do? \u0095 Write to The Observer Review at the usual address or e-mail margaret.cook@observer.co.uk. Views on next week's dilemma to reach us by Wednesday.",

The work swings from extremes of scale, volume and range. Two choirs, a large orchestra, several exotic instruments including kavals (a form of breathy flute), the great organ of St Paul's and even its bells, their joyful peals used as a finale, roll beguilingly round the building, teasing even the most reluctant ear. </p> <p>Tavener's volubly declared hatred of art music (music written for the concert hall rather than for God) has set him apart from fellow composers who at once scorn and envy him. One of their plaints is that all his music sounds the same. He would take this as high praise, since his aim is to work within an unchanging tradition, specifically that of his own Orthodox church. Yet however he might protest, Fall and Resurrection is richer and more dramatic than usual, the scoring denser, the grand climaxes almost Mahlerian, though he would recoil at the very idea. </p> <p>The performers excelled. Patricia Rozario and Stephen Richardson as Adam and Eve were required to sing at the extremes of their vocal range, with the countertenor Michael Chance ethereal and Martyn Hill an oriental-sounding Psaltis.

So did Tavener, who appeared like a frail, angelic giant at the end, rapturous amid the rapture. </p> <p>From the many to the one. Steven Osborne chose a monumental work from the last century to herald the new. Messiaen's 1945 pianistic epic, Vingt regards sur l'Enfant J\u00e9sus , springs from the same fount of faith which inspires Tavener. Their music is an act of prayer, any darkness in it not modern psychological anxiety but ancient terror of damnation. Accept that or the methods irritate, the rep etition baffles. Music of the past two centuries has not prized ritual and symmetry; Tavener and Messiaen look further back and are often misunderstood. </p> <p>Written shortly after the composer's release from a German prison camp, the Vingt regards uses opposing forces of frenzy and calm. Simple, unearthly parallel motifs, four octaves apart, contrast with close, splashy chords perfumed with jazzy sixths. Each movement has a title ('Regard of the Son Towards the Son', 'Regard of the Spirit of Joy' etc). Their elusive sameness may defeat the listener. </p> <p>At nearly two-and-a-quarter hours long without interval, this work in praise of God makes pretty stringent demands on Man (and Woman too; it was written for Yvonne Loriod, who was to become Messiaen's wife). The stamina, technique and muscle power required defy belief. Not many can do it. Pierre-Laurent Aimard gave a dazzling account at the BBC's Messiaen weekend a year ago; Osborne was every bit as exciting. In his magicianly hands, the piano transformed itself into harp, vibraphone, organ, bells. His grasp of structure was impressive, his virtuosity unshowy. </p> <p>Opera North chose midwinter for a no-nonsense production of A Midsummer Night's Dream. Not regarded as one of Britten's finest operas, it nevertheless has a sensuous orchestral score, evoking the pale mysteries of fairyland with delicious adroitness - lovingly performed here by the orchestra of Opera North under the company's new music director, Steven Sloane. </p> <p>In Moshe Leiser and Patrice Caurier's hands, the production dared to play down, if not remove entirely, woodland magic and fairy wings.

Christian Fenouillat's designs were minimal and geometric, offset by Agostino Cavalca's ingeniously detailed costumes. </p> <p>The awkward distribution of characters, uncertain enough in Shakespeare but further weakened in the Britten/Pears libretto, mars the work's dramatic pace, with wearying emphasis on the Pyramus and Thisbe scene. The Athenian lovers, though well sung, never quite establish their identity, Theseus and Hippolyta are reduced to a nonsensically brief appearance, while the rude mechanicals outstay their welcome. </p> <p>But Opera North's cast was first class, led by Claron McFadden as Tytania and Christopher Josey as Oberon, and Jan Knightley in the speaking role of Puck. The score is always worth hearing. The next performance is in Leeds on Saturday, then Nottingham, Manchester and Newcastle until the end of February. </p> <p>My colleague Philip French found little to recommend in the remake of Fantasia, now touring Imax cinemas. Having rougher sensibilities, and seeing it with a live performance of the music by the Philharmonia, conducted by James Levine at the Royal Albert Hall, I enjoyed it rather more than the original.

Her borrowed underwear was the main topic of discussion after the 11am news on Talk Radio last Thursday. But before you write Degsy's programme off as tabloid radio aimed at the mindless masses, let me tell you that before he aired Mrs B's thong, he covered the same subject as Nicky Campbell on Radio 5 Live - the new civil christening ceremonies. Campbell had worthy ladies from the Universal Church talking earnestly about the need for children to bond with the Universe. Degsy had Andy from Docklands who, well, like, didn't hold with religion but saw no harm in christening the kid in a hotel if that's what turned you on. Same with funerals. Why should they be in church? </p> <p>All that talk about heaven and hell was downright divisive, if you asked Andy. And since Degsy had asked him, he and we were duty-bound to listen to every last glorious word. Good on you, Andy - up with atheism. </p> <p> The knickers were purely a peg from which to hang the far more serious subject of celebrity. Posh Spice, Liz Hurley and Anthea Turner had only themselves to blame for trying to manipulate the press to their advantage, declared one of Degsy's studio experts, who raised the whole tone of the debate by referring to the world of showbiz thus: 'Of all the stars in the celebrity firmament, Chris Evans has the greatest integrity.' If that's what drivers are listening to no wonder there are so many motorway pile-ups. </p> <p> Try as I might, and brilliant as they are said to be, I just cannot hack one more No\u00ebl Coward centenary play. Last week, it was The Vortex , the week before Easy Virtue , both scoring 10 for performances and minus 10 for content. Maybe it's because his characters are parodied so often that the originals sound clich\u00e9d and trite. It must be fun to act him, with all that clipped 'Dulling, I adore you', but listening to it soon palls. I never tire of the upper-class hoorays in Waugh or Mitford. It may be that Coward the performer does the job so well himself in cabaret that the plays, with their ludicrous plots, are redundant.</p>",

Campbell had worthy ladies from the Universal Church talking earnestly about the need for children to bond with the Universe. Degsy had Andy from Docklands who, well, like, didn't hold with religion but saw no harm in christening the kid in a hotel if that's what turned you on. Same with funerals. Why should they be in church? All that talk about heaven and hell was downright divisive, if you asked Andy. And since Degsy had asked him, he and we were duty-bound to listen to every last glorious word. Good on you, Andy - up with atheism. The knickers were purely a peg from which to hang the far more serious subject of celebrity. Posh Spice, Liz Hurley and Anthea Turner had only themselves to blame for trying to manipulate the press to their advantage, declared one of Degsy's studio experts, who raised the whole tone of the debate by referring to the world of showbiz thus: 'Of all the stars in the celebrity firmament, Chris Evans has the greatest integrity.' If that's what drivers are listening to no wonder there are so many motorway pile-ups. Try as I might, and brilliant as they are said to be, I just cannot hack one more No\u00ebl Coward centenary play. Last week, it was The Vortex , the week before Easy Virtue , both scoring 10 for performances and minus 10 for content. Maybe it's because his characters are parodied so often that the originals sound clich\u00e9d and trite. It must be fun to act him, with all that clipped 'Dulling, I adore you', but listening to it soon palls. I never tire of the upper-class hoorays in Waugh or Mitford. It may be that Coward the performer does the job so well himself in cabaret that the plays, with their ludicrous plots, are redundant.",

      "body": "<b> Nitin Sawhney </b> The first time I saw Meera was on Tonight With Jonathan Ross in about 1992. It was astounding to see someone in a sari running rings around Ross on mainstream TV. She was very sharp and articulate. I was in my twenties and I'd only seen Asian people as stereotypes on television before - in It Ain't Half Hot Mum, Mind Your Language, The Party. They were never funny unless they were the butt of the joke. What surprised me was how in control she was as an Asian woman. I grew up in a very white, middle-class area, in Rochester in Kent, and remember always feeling inferior in some way. It was the way the educational system and the media work; and the National Front were very strong in my area. The stereotypes in the media seemed to condone children to openly mock Asian kids. When I saw Meera, it just made my eyes boggle. <p>About seven or eight years ago, I met her at the Leicester Haymarket. At the time, I was doing a double-act with Sanjeev Baskar called the Secret Asians. Then we encountered Meera, doing her stand-up routine. At the time, she had just had a personal tragedy, and it was incredible how professional she was. She just went back on stage and was funny, in control of herself and the audience. </p> <p>Two years later, we worked together on a musical called Night Train to Poona. She had a beautiful voice and was a great lyricist and we found we could write things on a serious level as well. We still cling to this idea of writing a musical together, perhaps with Philip Headley, artistic director of the Theatre Royal at Stratford East. </p> <p>She asked me to act and write music for a series she was doing for Radio 4 called Masala FM - a spoof radio show. There was quite a lot of the team from Goodness Gracious Me there. That was before John Ploughman, the head of BBC Light Entertainment, asked if we wanted to try for a TV series. I hadn't worked with anyone else as an actor or a writer, until Masala FM. But she believed in me. </p> <p>She's very flexible, very giving as a writer, and works without ego or arrogance. Meera has a very powerful sense of humour that combines satire with a sense of compassion and political awareness. It also stunned me how multi-talented she was. She can dance, write scripts, novels and music, and was in an a cappella band many years ago. With Goodness Gracious Me, she put a lot of work into making everything feel organic, and all of us had a real sense of fun about it. </p> <p>I don't write comedy any more. I've had a very successful year with my new album, but I still miss the idea of getting up on stage and having a laugh with a bunch of friends - which is what GGM was. Meera still comes to all my gigs, then phones me up and tells me what she thinks. In our work, the humour came from us being friends and getting on. More than anything, she's an inspiration as a person. </p> <p>There is almost an Asian renaissance that has gone on in this country. People talk of an Asian underground, but it's very much overground now. Meera was one of the early pioneers, making Asian people realise that stereotypes were no longer relevant to a multicultural Britain. She set a precedent for looking away from the stereotypes and preconceptions that people like Norman Tebbit were trying to impose upon us. She was a good friend as well. </p> <p> <b> Meera Syal </b> I first saw Nitin when I went to see him at a Secret Asians gig. I'd heard they were the best up-and-coming comedy duo. I was so impressed with both of them. It was a standard of comedy and music that I hadn't really seen coming out of us lot. Nitin was very much the strong silent one. He looked too young and had such grace, switching quite effortlessly from fooling around to producing this amazing music. It was so seamless. </p> <p>I assumed he wouldn't be interested in working with me but when I got to know him he was very self-effacing. He doesn't doubt his own ability but he's not very good at blowing his own trumpet. We all big each other up. There's such a small band of us, that we have to really. </p> <p>It's very much a British Asian thing for both of us. Nitin is still very interested in his culture, as am I. He's been to India loads of times. We don't make a point of discussing our backgrounds. With people on a similar wavelength, you've got a shorthand, which is what you want if you aren't going to go crazy together. The worst thing is having to explain yourself the whole time with other people. You can have in-jokes with each other. </p> <p>It was great working with him because we could just shortcut loads of things. It was a case of kindred spirits - people whom you click with. On one occasion, he turned up to write a song for a show the next day. We had the lyrics but no tune. I was really panicking - I had to sing it in about 10 hours. We came up with a tune in about 10 minutes. It was perfect. We both pick things up very quickly. We did write a really beautiful love song together - We Meet Again - about two people who have the feeling that they've met before. </p> <p>When it comes down to what he wants - he's an absolute control freak. Getting a compliment from Nitin was a very big thing. He doesn't give them out lightly. We're quite similar. I don't know if he suffers from this, but sometimes I worry that I'm a jack of all trades and not really brilliant at anything. He made absolutely the right decision to leave GGM and concentrate on his music, it was just upsetting because we were all working together, and we missed him. Writing the series, we'd have a laugh and then have to structure and graft it into a sketch that worked. It's difficult editing your own work all the time. It helps to have someone else there to say when it doesn't work. You need the reassurance of the group. If everybody laughs at a joke, you can be fairly sure that it's not because it's offensive. It was all very organic: we never sat down and discussed what the show was going to be about. You can't manufacture that shorthand. </p> <p>Nitin's suddenly got this lifestyle that's almost out of a movie. He'll say: 'Oh, Paul McCartney came round last week.' You always find out who he's met a month afterwards. I went to an evening with Tom Jones recently: I think I told everyone - people I didn't know, actually - I was ringing random people out of the phonebook. I can't really pop round any more just to see Nitin. I have to find out what part of the world he's in first. What binds you in the end is whether you have a friendship and get on. We're not just bound together because we're second generation British Asians. It's about the answer to the question: 'Do you want to hang out with this person?'</p>",

It can improve the look of a tan by removing the flaky skin cells that make the skin look dull. 2 The speed at which your hair grows is hereditary and not determined by the age you start shaving. 3 Shaving does not encourage hair to grow darker, faster or thicker. New growth is blunt-edged and synchronised so it may appear to be coming through thicker and faster. Shaving facts 1 A man's beard grows approximately four tenths of a millimetre a day or six inches a year. 2 A beard contains 7,000 to 20,000 hairs. 3 Beard hair is extremely tough - about as strong as copper wire and the same thickness. 4 The first safety razor was patented by Mr King Camp Gillette in 1903. 5 During an average lifetime, men spend around 3,350 hours removing over 27 feet of whiskers.",

Smooth and gamey on the palate, this is a supple, savoury, complex red with notes of vanilla, leather and wild strawberry. <p><b> 1990 Wehlener Sonnenuhr Riesling Auslese, Dr Loosen (\u00a316.99, from Waitrose Direct on 0800 188881)</b> Very few, if any, white grapes develop in the bottle as well as Riesling does. This elegant Mosel from one of the best producers in Germany (and one of the finest vineyards) is starting to settle into honeyed maturity, but still tastes remarkably fresh.

But looking for the first time into his background William Shaw found that Anderson's story was far more ambiguous",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It began with a question: 'You from the South? ' It was a chance meeting in the crowded lobby of the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas. A multi-platinum recording star and a completely unknown 22-year-old fan. Usually it is the fan who approaches the star. This time it was the other way around.</p> <p>It was 7 September 1996. Mike Tyson had just KO-ed Bruce Seldon in a mere 109 seconds. Tupac Shakur was the most bankable hip hop star in America; his latest release, All Eyez On Me - rap's first double album - would sell more than four million copies.</p> <p>Orlando Anderson was on the other end of the spectrum. He was a fan who claimed to own all of Tupac's records. The young man with the small moustache and the barest hint of an Afro haircut was an unemployed father of three children, raised in one of the most run-down neighbourhoods of Los Angeles. Tupac had had ringside seats; Orlando had reportedly snuck in at the back.</p> <p>'You from the South? ' Tupac had asked, and then, in full view of the passers-by and the hotel security cameras, he pulled back his fist and slammed it into the side of Orlando's head, knocking him to the ground. Suge Knight, the owner of Tupac's record label Death Row, joined in with the rest of Tupac's entourage, kicking Anderson in the head and body before melting away into the night.</p> <p>A few hours later, Tupac was shot by a gunman who pulled alongside the car carrying him and Suge through downtown Vegas. Six days later, hip hop's most incendiary and charismatic icon was dead. It didn't take long before the rumours started flying that Orlando Anderson was the one who pulled the trigger.</p> <p>No one seemed particularly surprised when Orlando was killed a little more than 18 months later in an unrelated shoot-out. Actually, in the hundreds of stories filed after Tupac's death, very little was ever written about Orlando: he was just 'a known gang banger' - as Americans call gang members - or 'a Crip', 'the suspect in the murder of Tupac Shakur'.</p> <p>Such a brief, nihilistic life. I began to wonder if that's all there was to the man who had blundered into the headlines so haphazardly after Tupac singled him out that night: ' You from the South? '</p> <p>Orlando was indeed from the South - from the South Side of Compton, that is. He would have instantly understood the threat behind those four words. The curt challenge contained two decades of violent history. It is standard prelude to a gang fight: 'Where you from?'</p> <p>Orlando Anderson's family doesn't like the press much, nor the way it has depicted Orlando. Beyond issuing a terse statement in October 1996 insisting on his innocence, they have refused to be interviewed. Initially, when I asked, they declined to talk. Finally, six months later, they delegated Orlando's half-brother Pooh to speak on their behalf. Pooh says we journalists got it all wrong. Orlando was a quiet boy: 'Never caused a problem. One thing about him, he was always involved in positive things. Always, always, always.'</p> <p>Pooh himself doesn't exactly come across like the brother of a gang banger. Now 25, he had won a scholarship to a private high school and gone on to graduate from the University of California at Berkeley after majoring in film. He doesn't deny that his brother was involved in local gangs in his early teens, but says he was too smart to stay involved. He insists that Orlando did nothing more serious than possibly breaking into a local school.</p> <p>Certainly if, as the Compton police stated, Orlando was indeed a gang banger, he wasn't a run-of-the-mill one. 'He wasn't that type of person at all,' says Tyise Tooles, a friend and former classmate of Orlando's at Dominguez High School, in Compton. 'He was a real friendly person, real cool.'</p> <p>He was a conscientious student who passed his exams. For a while, he went to Taft High, a school for high achievers out in the Valley - the same school the rapper Ice Cube went to. Pooh says he's not sure why Orlando was sent there, though at the time the city did operate programmes to remove children who were at risk of becoming involved in gang lifestyles to schools outside the area. Orlando returned to Dominguez High for his senior year and started dating a young woman named Rasheena Smith.</p> <p>There's a picture of them in the school yearbook, photographed at the '92 Too Good to be True' prom. The caption reads: 'Orlando Anderson and Rashina [sic] Smith looking Don Good'. Gang bangers don't often graduate, but Orlando got his diploma that year. His class ring remained his favourite piece of jewellery.</p> <p>That year, there were a staggering 803 gang-related deaths in LA County. The yearbook contains a full-page ad and several smaller ones for neighbourhood mortuaries.</p> <p>Orlando's had been a secure childhood. His father, Harvey Lee Anderson, split with his mother, Charlotte Davis, but Orlando had grown up in his great-grandmother Utah's house on South Burris Road, surrounded by aunts, uncles and grandparents.</p> <p>It was a typical South Central family history, in many ways. Utah, born in Texas just before the outbreak of the First World War, had left the South in the great African-American migration northwards. South Central boomed briefly during the Second World War as LA's munitions industries soaked up labour, but the war ended and South Central turned into a massively overpopulated slum.</p> <p>Utah moved to Compton in the Fifties, when it was an affluent middle-class neighbourhood, only to watch property values crash as whites fled. Orlando's mother Charlotte worked 12-hour shifts as a bookkeeper to support her children, but on most weekends there would be some large family gathering that brought everyone together to play sports and have a big meal.</p> <p>A rapper friend of Orlando's remembers envying the closeness of Orlando's family: 'We all had problems with our parents. Our mothers were on crack and our dads weren't around. Orlando had something I didn't have, and that was family. He was still in school. He ate every day. There were really no problems.'</p> <p>Orlando didn't smoke - neither cigarettes nor weed - nor was he much of a drinker. And unlike the typical neighbourhood gang banger, he was never convicted of any crime. But the loyalties of the neighbourhood run deep. Some of the boys Orlando hung out with were ones who wore blue plaid shirts and would throw up the 'C' handsigns. The lampposts on South Burris where Orlando grew up are all spray-painted with the letters 'SS': South Side. A stop sign has been redesigned in blue aerosol paint to read: 'Can't STOP the SSC'. This is South Side Crip territory.</p> <p>Compton still calls itself boastfully 'The Hub City', lying as it does on the main rail artery between the city of Los Angeles and the San Pedro docks. In the Sixties, Compton became the first city in California to have an African-American political majority. Any optimism that era might have enjoyed is long gone. Compton has seen 40 years of unreversed decline.</p> <p>The whole world knows about Bloods and Crips. Cities the world over have gangs that model themselves after these Los Angeles street alliances - but the original fight between the two 'sets', as the gangs prefer to call themselves, began here, in Compton.</p> <p>Until the arrival of the Crips at the tail end of the Sixties, LA's gangs had been relatively peaceful. The Crips were a new force which had set out to unify LA gangs into a formidable alliance. On the north side of Compton, one of the older sets, known then as the Piru Street Gang, had been among the first to join the Crip alliance, even down to wearing the blue 'rags' that served as a uniform. But the Pirus were uneasy about the Crip hegemony. In 1972, they allied with another local group, the Leuders Park Hustlers, to form a new counter-alliance. The Pirus stripped off their blue and started wearing red. Soon they were calling themselves Bloods.</p> <p>So it was that the streets of Compton became the epicentre of the 20-year war between Blood and Crip. The conflict escalated fast. By the early Eighties, the LAPD were estimating that there were already some 15,000 Crips and Bloods in the Los Angeles area. Once gang membership has reached its own critical mass in poor areas, it develops its own dynamic. If you're being constantly challenged with the aggressive territorial question 'Where you from?', it's not long before you start to look for some sort of protection. Loyalties are no longer chosen - they are dictated by geography.</p> <p>Compton became newly Balkanised. To the north, in Lynwood, Bloods such as the Leuders Park and MOB Pirus ruled. To the south, in Compton, were sets like the Corner Pocket Crips, the Kelly Park Crips, the Neighborhood Crips and the South Sides. It's such a tiny, impoverished piece of the Los Angeles sprawl, a few small square miles. And 20 years of bloodshed contained in the four words You from the South?</p> <p>Murder rates climbed year by year, but the rest of the world paid little attention. Who had even heard of Compton before 1987? That's the year a former Compton Crip known as Eric 'Eazy E' Wright - a friend of Orlando's family - corralled a group of talented LA rappers, including Ice Cube and Dr Dre, to form Niggas With Attitude. NWA was the first group to lay out the ground rules for what became known as gangsta rap, mythologising the real violence that was taking place on their own doorstep. NWA turned multi-platinum, and Eazy's label, Relentless, became a seemingly unstoppable money maker.</p> <p>Rap changed everything around here, offering a new hope. Until Eazy, the only glamorous get-rich-quick career plan on offer was dealing drugs. Gangsta rap, for a time, at least, was a way out of the gang lifestyle.</p> <p>Then came Marion 'Sugar Bear' Knight - a one-time gang banger with the North Side's MOB Piru Bloods. He wanted some of what Eazy had. Knight founded his business on the production talent of Dr Dre, whom Suge - according to the rumours, at least - infamously strong-armed out of his contract with Eazy with the help of several thugs and a few baseball bats. After 1992, Death Row flourished; Relentless plummeted. The North was up, the South was down.</p> <p>To call Knight a gang banger would be a misnomer. Bangers are the poor, usually teenage boys who hang out on corners, protecting territory. But Suge enjoyed playing the role of godfather. It's no secret that he placed Bloods from his neighbourhood on his payroll. Money flooded into the North Side of Compton, but at a price.</p> <p>Tupac wasn't from Compton. He had been born in the east. When Tupac was convicted in 1995 of sexually assaulting a female fan, Suge Knight saw his chance to gain control of the fastest-rising star in hip hop. He arranged for $1.4 million bail to be put up to release Tupac from jail pending his appeal.</p> <p>Joining Death Row made Tupac a superstar, but it also brought out the worst in him. With Death Row acting like a gang itself, Tupac eagerly took to the role. The platinum rapper with a luxury apartment on Beverly Boulevard played the part of street-corner thug with relish. In photo sessions, he wore the red rag on his head, holding up 'B' gang handsigns. In his open-top Jaguar, Tupac would roll through the Piru and Leuders Park Blood neighbourhoods, proudly mixing with his people. Orlando became enmeshed in the politics of Blood and Crip because he grew up among them. Tupac became affiliated out of choice.</p> <p>Ironically, it turns out that what Orlando really dreamed of was a career in the music business, but by 1996, the year he turned 21, he had made little headway. He lived with Rasheena in her apartment in Lakewood, just south-east of Compton. She was a student nurse, and by this time they had two girls, Krystal, then aged two, and Courtney, one. But he was also juggling another relationship, with a girl named Taiece Lanier, who had just given birth to a girl, Ariel. Only when Pooh returned to Compton in May after graduating from college did things start to progress. He and Orlando decided to start a record label together and, believing in the power of positivity, called it Success Records.</p> <p>Orlando's other passion was sports. So on 7 September, he drove to Las Vegas with Rasheena in a borrowed car to watch the Tyson fight, checking into the Excalibur Hotel just across the street from the MGM Grand.</p> <p>After Tupac was shot, the Las Vegas police were strongly criticised for failing to conduct follow-up interviews with possible witnesses who were in the cars behind Suge Knight's. Some of these, of course, were reluctant to talk to the police. Suge was the only person in the car with Tupac; Las Vegas police frostily described him as 'uncooperative'.</p> <p>On 12 September, Compton police received a report from a gang contact who said that Bloods affiliated with Death Row believed Tupac's assault on Orlando had been prompted by an incident a few weeks earlier: three Piru Bloods had been approached by South Side Crips in a Foot Locker - a sports-shoe chain - in Lakewood Mall. One of the Pirus, Trevon 'Tray' Lane, was wearing a gold necklace from which dangled a Death Row emblem - a personal gift from Suge Knight. One of the Crips snatched it. In South Central, that's like taking a war trophy.</p> <p>According to the informant, Tray had been part of the Death Row posse the night of the Tyson fight and had told Tupac in the seconds before Orlando Anderson was assaulted that Orlando was one of the Crips who had confronted him in the Foot Locker. The informant then fingered Orlando as the man who later shot Tupac.</p> <p>In Compton, a bloody war broke out between the North and South Sides. Over the next few days, police counted 12 shooting incidents and three fatalities. Paranoia gripped the neighbourhood. There were rumours that Bloods were being offered $10,000 for every South Side Crip killed.</p> <p>On the night of 2 October, 300 police officers swept down on the houses of known gang bangers in Compton and neighbourhoods to the south and east. The raid was ostensibly part of a crackdown to try to halt the warfare. But it also gave Compton police the opportunity to arrest Orlando.</p> <p>The affidavit that police prepared in order to obtain the arrest warrant cited additional informants who linked Orlando to violent gang warfare. The police arrested Orlando - not for the murder of Tupac Shakur, but for the 12 April slaying of a man named Edward Webb, who had been attacked from behind at a party and shot dead by 'several black males'.</p> <p>Las Vegas detectives accompanied the Compton police, ready to question Orlando about the Tupac murder, but neither the Compton police nor the Las Vegas police department was able to turn the circumstantial evidence of the informants into anything that would make a case. In reality, much of their affidavit only detailed what members of Blood gangs and their associates at Death Row Records were saying about an alleged Crip. The Las Vegas police could not link Orlando to Tupac's murder, nor were the Compton police able to satisfy the district attorney that they had enough to hold him even for the murder of Edward Webb. DA Janet Moore ordered that Orlando be released. At the time, her spokesperson merely announced: 'We felt they needed to do some more work.'</p> <p>Three years later, and now employed in a different city, Moore refuses to go into the details of exactly why she made that decision.</p> <p>Orlando was free, but now he was publicly identified by the damning - yet ultimately inconclusive - evidence that had been leaked to the press. He became 'the man who shot Tupac'. Now when he went out, he realised people were looking at him. He would think: 'They know who I am.'</p> <p>One day, he sadly told his attorney: 'You know, I don't think I'm going to have a long life.'</p> <p>To be known as the man who shot Tupac leant a surreal edge to Orlando's life. Once, he was in Underworld Records, a shop in a run-down mini-mall on Alondra Boulevard. A girl in the store spotted a book on sale called The Killing of Tupac Shakur . The gaudy cover blared: 'WHO did it and WHY?' The girl looked at it contemptuously and mouthed off the latest conspiracy theory doing the rounds: 'Tupac's not dead. He's alive and living in Cuba.'</p> <p>The book, of course, contained a photo of Orlando, captioned. Suddenly, she looked up at the real Orlando. 'Damn!' she said. 'That's the guy who killed Tupac.'</p> <p>For a glorious second, everyone laughed. 'Didn't you just say Tupac was still alive?' someone said. The girl watched Orlando, unnerved.</p> <p>But by 1998, his reputation still hadn't killed him. Things seemed to be looking up. He would wake up early and take out his pit bulls, Blue and Na-Na, riding a bicycle along the sidewalks, with the dogs running behind. He and Rasheena had another daughter, Sierra. 'God is with me,' he would say. 'I'm not going to worry about it. I can't spend the rest of my life worrying about Tupac.'</p> <p>Success Records was finally starting to take shape. Orlando had found a garage in Compton to act as its HQ: he and Pooh built a studio in there, and Orlando had begun recording local talent.</p> <p>'Orlando had a vision,' says Greg Cross, owner of Underworld Records, a local mom-and-pop store, and a close friend of Eazy E's. Cross claims he was Orlando's business adviser. 'He was a very quiet-natured person.' His words echo what I've heard from so many others. Orlando was well-loved around here; everyone says he was generous and charismatic and not at all violent.</p> <p>I ask Cross how Orlando, an unemployed man with four daughters, could afford to set up his studio. 'It was the money from the lawsuit,' he says vaguely. When I press him, he sighs and says, 'Well, it's no secret. Death Row had made some payments to him. That's the money he was using.'</p> <p>In 1995, Suge had pleaded guilty to two counts of assault stemming from a vicious 1992 attack on two young would-be rappers he had caught using a telephone without his permission in his studio. He was still on parole when the hotel security-camera video clearly showed Suge taking part in Tupac's assault on Orlando. Legal authorities had been looking for something they could use to put Suge behind bars.</p> <p>Orlando was subpoenaed to appear as a witness at Suge's parole hearings. When interviewed by Las Vegas police, Orlando had plainly told them Suge had assaulted him. But on the witness stand, he reversed his testimony. Suge was 'the only one I heard saying, \"Stop this shit!\"' As presiding Los Angeles Superior Court judge J Stephen Czuleger noted, Orlando was obviously lying.</p> <p>The rumours began spreading that Suge had paid off Orlando. And there was no doubt that for a man with no job, Orlando always seemed to have cash during his last year alive. Rappers all over LA remember how he would turn up with champagne. 'The guy used to reach into his pockets every time he saw us,' says one of Coolio's MCs, Mayno, who met Orlando two months before his death. 'One time, he bought us a big gallon of R\u00e9my. Man, we drank it until it was gone, and then he went and got some more.'</p> <p>Orlando's attorney, Ren\u00e9e Campbell, denies that her client received any payoff. 'He hadn't been paid anything by Suge Knight,' she told me, flatly contradicting Greg Cross. Campbell says that Orlando was simply too terrified for his life to testify against Suge. 'He lived a life of complete fear,' she says. (Knight's attorney, David Kenner, has not responded to repeated requests for comment.)</p> <p>Not that Campbell isn't partisan. She is, after all, pursuing a suit against the estate of Tupac Shakur, Death Row Records, Suge Knight and other unidentified persons for compensation for the injuries that Orlando received in the assault. She is seeking punitive damages on behalf of Orlando's estate.</p> <p>I ask Pooh about the rumours that Suge paid Orlando to testify in his favour. 'I know nothing about that,' he says, taken aback. 'As a matter of fact - that's so ridiculous. Where is the money, then? I'm sure his kids need it.'</p> <p>Pooh says that the financial investment in the studio was entirely his own. Pooh had worked as an extra and appeared in a TV commercial, and had saved enough to provide the seed money. Orlando's role was to deliver the talent and the industry contacts. 'He was the one who knew everyone in rap,' says Pooh.</p> <p>That Orlando bought champagne for people in the business he wanted to impress isn't that unusual. It's how business is often done in the hip hop industry. The money, Pooh insists, probably came from family members who felt sorry for Orlando. 'Our family - we're not desperate and poverty-stricken!' he says. The hidden inference enrages him. 'If he's an African-American male and he doesn't work from nine to five, then he is a murderer?' he asks me.</p> <p>South Central can be like a maze. Rumours take on a life of their own. In this divided place, whispers and innuendo turn half-truths into hard fact.</p> <p>On 29 May last year, Utah Williams, the 85-year-old matriarch at the heart of Orlando's family, died in the hospital where she'd been taken after a fall. Orlando's mother Charlotte remained at the hospital, so Orlando, who had been waiting for her at the family home, decided to go out and get a burger with an old friend, Michael Reed Dorrough.</p> <p>A little after 3pm, driving a borrowed Chevvy Blazer, he pulled into the parking lot of Cigs Record Store, at the intersection of Alondra and Oleander. This is Corner Pocket Crip territory, directly to the east of South Side territory. Though both groups are Crips, they are rivals.</p> <p>According to the police, Orlando spotted Michael Stone at a car wash across the intersection and confronted him about money that Orlando believed Michael owed him. Michael was accompanied by his nephew, Jerry Stone. Tempers rose, and a gunfight erupted. All four were hit; Orlando and the Stones were all fatally injured.</p> <p>With Dorrough in the passenger seat, Orlando tried to drive to safety. He only made it a few blocks, to the corner of Willowbrook and Cocoa, on the far side of Compton High, before lapsing into unconsciousness. The three were pronounced dead at the Martin Luther King Jr-Drew Medical Center - the hospital locals call it 'Killer King' because so many of the young men who go there, often with gunshot wounds, are dead by the time they leave.</p> <p>Around 4pm that day, the pagers began to go off. News of Orlando's shooting spread fast. A rapper friend of his rushed to the scene. He noted that the police hadn't even taped off the shot-up Blazer. To him, it was as if they didn't even think Orlando was worth it. 'What happened?' he asked a cop.</p> <p>'Well, the guys from the South Side and the Corner Pockets got into it. Jerry Stone and Orlando Anderson are dead.' Then he said something like, 'They took a job of work off our hands.'</p> <p>Orlando's friend looked at the cop and thought, 'That's fucked up.' Then he walked over and looked at the bullet holes in the Blazer and imagined where the bullets had hit and ricocheted.</p> <p>Pooh had been driving to an audition in Hollywood when his pager flashed up '911' - the US telephone code for emergency services. By the time he made it to King-Drew, Orlando was dead. Pooh reeled from the shock of losing the two people he loved the most - Utah and Orlando - in a single day. It didn't seem real.</p> <p>Originally, police appeared to believe that it was Jerry Stone who fired the first shot. Greg Cross believes that it was Orlando's reputation as the man who killed Tupac which led to the fire-fight. Cross knew all four people involved in the shooting. He reckons that when Jerry Stone saw Orlando arguing with his uncle, he pulled his gun, thinking, 'Man. This is the guy that killed Tupac. I got to be quick with the draw.'</p> <p>But in the opening days of Dorrough's trial for murder in July 1999, the prosecuting attorney presented eye-witness and forensic evidence suggesting that Orlando had fired the first shot. Dorrough used Orlando's gun to return fire.</p> <p>When I called Pooh to tell him this news, it was like a bombshell. All along he had believed his brother was unarmed.</p> <p>Pooh steadfastly refuses to believe that his brother was armed, or fired the first shot. 'It's impossible,' he says, clearly shocked. He thinks the police have it all wrong, just as he thinks they were wrong when they named Orlando as the possible murderer of Tupac Shakur. His voice is choked. It sounds like he's crying. This is the third time his brother has been accused of shooting someone: first Edward Webb, then Tupac, now the Stones. Now he's dead, thinks Pooh cynically, they say they have conclusive evidence against him.</p> <p>Dorrough was found guilty of murder. His attorney remains unhappy about the case. She has been pressing for a re-trial. Like Pooh, she believes that the evidence presented by the prosecution is unreliable. But re-trials are rare.</p> <p>Las Vegas police admit that they have no suspects in the Shakur case, though they've never ruled out Orlando, either. 'You don't consider him as a suspect, but you haven't ruled him out?' I ask Sergeant Kevin Manning, the detective assigned to the case.</p> <p>'It may be a play on words, a little bit,' he says, 'but that's just the way we do business.'</p> <p>The Compton police have backed away from linking Orlando to Tupac's murder. Though initial rumours had suggested that the Bloods from the North had fingered him as the killer, that now seems less likely. If they really believed what they were claiming, they'd have killed him long before a Crip did in May 1998. However, Compton police still insist that at the time of Orlando's death they were in the process of building a case against him for the murder of Edward Webb.</p> <p>Pooh thinks it's about race and politics. 'Orlando Anderson is an African-American. Do you think that if there was one shred of evidence against an African-American male of his age, that he would not be behind bars right at this moment?'</p> <p>I want to believe Pooh, though it's hard to share the faith he has in his brother. I know, at least, that people found it a little too easy to fit Orlando into their picture of a killer from a failing inner city. He was a grainy face on a security video, a minor player from a place outsiders expect to be full of killers. They know. After all, they've heard all the CDs.</p> <p>In a way, that's the trouble. Real life and art became confused. People on the South Side still blame Tupac for the whole situation. They believe he was the one who stoked the gang animosities: he was the reason people feared for their lives when they saw Orlando, and that Orlando, in turn, feared for his own.</p> <p>'Tupac started everything,' says one of Orlando's friends. 'You got to hate him for what he started. For Orlando to be a fan of someone and not know him, and then for Tupac to come up to Orlando with some gang stuff.'</p> <p>To me, that's the root of it all. He was trying to live out his lyrics too much. Tupac crossed the line by coming up and saying, ' You from the South?

      "bodyText": "It began with a question: 'You from the South? ' It was a chance meeting in the crowded lobby of the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas. A multi-platinum recording star and a completely unknown 22-year-old fan. Usually it is the fan who approaches the star. This time it was the other way around. It was 7 September 1996. Mike Tyson had just KO-ed Bruce Seldon in a mere 109 seconds. Tupac Shakur was the most bankable hip hop star in America; his latest release, All Eyez On Me - rap's first double album - would sell more than four million copies. Orlando Anderson was on the other end of the spectrum. He was a fan who claimed to own all of Tupac's records. The young man with the small moustache and the barest hint of an Afro haircut was an unemployed father of three children, raised in one of the most run-down neighbourhoods of Los Angeles. Tupac had had ringside seats; Orlando had reportedly snuck in at the back. 'You from the South? ' Tupac had asked, and then, in full view of the passers-by and the hotel security cameras, he pulled back his fist and slammed it into the side of Orlando's head, knocking him to the ground. Suge Knight, the owner of Tupac's record label Death Row, joined in with the rest of Tupac's entourage, kicking Anderson in the head and body before melting away into the night. A few hours later, Tupac was shot by a gunman who pulled alongside the car carrying him and Suge through downtown Vegas. Six days later, hip hop's most incendiary and charismatic icon was dead. It didn't take long before the rumours started flying that Orlando Anderson was the one who pulled the trigger. No one seemed particularly surprised when Orlando was killed a little more than 18 months later in an unrelated shoot-out. Actually, in the hundreds of stories filed after Tupac's death, very little was ever written about Orlando: he was just 'a known gang banger' - as Americans call gang members - or 'a Crip', 'the suspect in the murder of Tupac Shakur'. Such a brief, nihilistic life. I began to wonder if that's all there was to the man who had blundered into the headlines so haphazardly after Tupac singled him out that night: ' You from the South? ' Orlando was indeed from the South - from the South Side of Compton, that is. He would have instantly understood the threat behind those four words. The curt challenge contained two decades of violent history. It is standard prelude to a gang fight: 'Where you from?' Orlando Anderson's family doesn't like the press much, nor the way it has depicted Orlando. Beyond issuing a terse statement in October 1996 insisting on his innocence, they have refused to be interviewed. Initially, when I asked, they declined to talk. Finally, six months later, they delegated Orlando's half-brother Pooh to speak on their behalf. Pooh says we journalists got it all wrong. Orlando was a quiet boy: 'Never caused a problem. One thing about him, he was always involved in positive things. Always, always, always.' Pooh himself doesn't exactly come across like the brother of a gang banger. Now 25, he had won a scholarship to a private high school and gone on to graduate from the University of California at Berkeley after majoring in film. He doesn't deny that his brother was involved in local gangs in his early teens, but says he was too smart to stay involved. He insists that Orlando did nothing more serious than possibly breaking into a local school. Certainly if, as the Compton police stated, Orlando was indeed a gang banger, he wasn't a run-of-the-mill one. 'He wasn't that type of person at all,' says Tyise Tooles, a friend and former classmate of Orlando's at Dominguez High School, in Compton. 'He was a real friendly person, real cool.' He was a conscientious student who passed his exams. For a while, he went to Taft High, a school for high achievers out in the Valley - the same school the rapper Ice Cube went to. Pooh says he's not sure why Orlando was sent there, though at the time the city did operate programmes to remove children who were at risk of becoming involved in gang lifestyles to schools outside the area. Orlando returned to Dominguez High for his senior year and started dating a young woman named Rasheena Smith. There's a picture of them in the school yearbook, photographed at the '92 Too Good to be True' prom. The caption reads: 'Orlando Anderson and Rashina [sic] Smith looking Don Good'. Gang bangers don't often graduate, but Orlando got his diploma that year. His class ring remained his favourite piece of jewellery. That year, there were a staggering 803 gang-related deaths in LA County. The yearbook contains a full-page ad and several smaller ones for neighbourhood mortuaries. Orlando's had been a secure childhood. His father, Harvey Lee Anderson, split with his mother, Charlotte Davis, but Orlando had grown up in his great-grandmother Utah's house on South Burris Road, surrounded by aunts, uncles and grandparents. It was a typical South Central family history, in many ways. Utah, born in Texas just before the outbreak of the First World War, had left the South in the great African-American migration northwards. South Central boomed briefly during the Second World War as LA's munitions industries soaked up labour, but the war ended and South Central turned into a massively overpopulated slum. Utah moved to Compton in the Fifties, when it was an affluent middle-class neighbourhood, only to watch property values crash as whites fled. Orlando's mother Charlotte worked 12-hour shifts as a bookkeeper to support her children, but on most weekends there would be some large family gathering that brought everyone together to play sports and have a big meal. A rapper friend of Orlando's remembers envying the closeness of Orlando's family: 'We all had problems with our parents. Our mothers were on crack and our dads weren't around. Orlando had something I didn't have, and that was family. He was still in school. He ate every day. There were really no problems.' Orlando didn't smoke - neither cigarettes nor weed - nor was he much of a drinker. And unlike the typical neighbourhood gang banger, he was never convicted of any crime. But the loyalties of the neighbourhood run deep. Some of the boys Orlando hung out with were ones who wore blue plaid shirts and would throw up the 'C' handsigns. The lampposts on South Burris where Orlando grew up are all spray-painted with the letters 'SS': South Side. A stop sign has been redesigned in blue aerosol paint to read: 'Can't STOP the SSC'. This is South Side Crip territory. Compton still calls itself boastfully 'The Hub City', lying as it does on the main rail artery between the city of Los Angeles and the San Pedro docks. In the Sixties, Compton became the first city in California to have an African-American political majority. Any optimism that era might have enjoyed is long gone. Compton has seen 40 years of unreversed decline. The whole world knows about Bloods and Crips. Cities the world over have gangs that model themselves after these Los Angeles street alliances - but the original fight between the two 'sets', as the gangs prefer to call themselves, began here, in Compton. Until the arrival of the Crips at the tail end of the Sixties, LA's gangs had been relatively peaceful. The Crips were a new force which had set out to unify LA gangs into a formidable alliance. On the north side of Compton, one of the older sets, known then as the Piru Street Gang, had been among the first to join the Crip alliance, even down to wearing the blue 'rags' that served as a uniform. But the Pirus were uneasy about the Crip hegemony. In 1972, they allied with another local group, the Leuders Park Hustlers, to form a new counter-alliance. The Pirus stripped off their blue and started wearing red. Soon they were calling themselves Bloods. So it was that the streets of Compton became the epicentre of the 20-year war between Blood and Crip. The conflict escalated fast. By the early Eighties, the LAPD were estimating that there were already some 15,000 Crips and Bloods in the Los Angeles area. Once gang membership has reached its own critical mass in poor areas, it develops its own dynamic. If you're being constantly challenged with the aggressive territorial question 'Where you from?', it's not long before you start to look for some sort of protection. Loyalties are no longer chosen - they are dictated by geography. Compton became newly Balkanised. To the north, in Lynwood, Bloods such as the Leuders Park and MOB Pirus ruled. To the south, in Compton, were sets like the Corner Pocket Crips, the Kelly Park Crips, the Neighborhood Crips and the South Sides. It's such a tiny, impoverished piece of the Los Angeles sprawl, a few small square miles. And 20 years of bloodshed contained in the four words You from the South? Murder rates climbed year by year, but the rest of the world paid little attention. Who had even heard of Compton before 1987? That's the year a former Compton Crip known as Eric 'Eazy E' Wright - a friend of Orlando's family - corralled a group of talented LA rappers, including Ice Cube and Dr Dre, to form Niggas With Attitude. NWA was the first group to lay out the ground rules for what became known as gangsta rap, mythologising the real violence that was taking place on their own doorstep. NWA turned multi-platinum, and Eazy's label, Relentless, became a seemingly unstoppable money maker. Rap changed everything around here, offering a new hope. Until Eazy, the only glamorous get-rich-quick career plan on offer was dealing drugs. Gangsta rap, for a time, at least, was a way out of the gang lifestyle. Then came Marion 'Sugar Bear' Knight - a one-time gang banger with the North Side's MOB Piru Bloods. He wanted some of what Eazy had. Knight founded his business on the production talent of Dr Dre, whom Suge - according to the rumours, at least - infamously strong-armed out of his contract with Eazy with the help of several thugs and a few baseball bats. After 1992, Death Row flourished; Relentless plummeted. The North was up, the South was down. To call Knight a gang banger would be a misnomer. Bangers are the poor, usually teenage boys who hang out on corners, protecting territory. But Suge enjoyed playing the role of godfather. It's no secret that he placed Bloods from his neighbourhood on his payroll. Money flooded into the North Side of Compton, but at a price. Tupac wasn't from Compton. He had been born in the east. When Tupac was convicted in 1995 of sexually assaulting a female fan, Suge Knight saw his chance to gain control of the fastest-rising star in hip hop. He arranged for $1.4 million bail to be put up to release Tupac from jail pending his appeal. Joining Death Row made Tupac a superstar, but it also brought out the worst in him. With Death Row acting like a gang itself, Tupac eagerly took to the role. The platinum rapper with a luxury apartment on Beverly Boulevard played the part of street-corner thug with relish. In photo sessions, he wore the red rag on his head, holding up 'B' gang handsigns. In his open-top Jaguar, Tupac would roll through the Piru and Leuders Park Blood neighbourhoods, proudly mixing with his people. Orlando became enmeshed in the politics of Blood and Crip because he grew up among them. Tupac became affiliated out of choice. Ironically, it turns out that what Orlando really dreamed of was a career in the music business, but by 1996, the year he turned 21, he had made little headway. He lived with Rasheena in her apartment in Lakewood, just south-east of Compton. She was a student nurse, and by this time they had two girls, Krystal, then aged two, and Courtney, one. But he was also juggling another relationship, with a girl named Taiece Lanier, who had just given birth to a girl, Ariel. Only when Pooh returned to Compton in May after graduating from college did things start to progress. He and Orlando decided to start a record label together and, believing in the power of positivity, called it Success Records. Orlando's other passion was sports. So on 7 September, he drove to Las Vegas with Rasheena in a borrowed car to watch the Tyson fight, checking into the Excalibur Hotel just across the street from the MGM Grand. After Tupac was shot, the Las Vegas police were strongly criticised for failing to conduct follow-up interviews with possible witnesses who were in the cars behind Suge Knight's. Some of these, of course, were reluctant to talk to the police. Suge was the only person in the car with Tupac; Las Vegas police frostily described him as 'uncooperative'. On 12 September, Compton police received a report from a gang contact who said that Bloods affiliated with Death Row believed Tupac's assault on Orlando had been prompted by an incident a few weeks earlier: three Piru Bloods had been approached by South Side Crips in a Foot Locker - a sports-shoe chain - in Lakewood Mall. One of the Pirus, Trevon 'Tray' Lane, was wearing a gold necklace from which dangled a Death Row emblem - a personal gift from Suge Knight. One of the Crips snatched it. In South Central, that's like taking a war trophy. According to the informant, Tray had been part of the Death Row posse the night of the Tyson fight and had told Tupac in the seconds before Orlando Anderson was assaulted that Orlando was one of the Crips who had confronted him in the Foot Locker. The informant then fingered Orlando as the man who later shot Tupac. In Compton, a bloody war broke out between the North and South Sides. Over the next few days, police counted 12 shooting incidents and three fatalities. Paranoia gripped the neighbourhood. There were rumours that Bloods were being offered $10,000 for every South Side Crip killed. On the night of 2 October, 300 police officers swept down on the houses of known gang bangers in Compton and neighbourhoods to the south and east. The raid was ostensibly part of a crackdown to try to halt the warfare. But it also gave Compton police the opportunity to arrest Orlando. The affidavit that police prepared in order to obtain the arrest warrant cited additional informants who linked Orlando to violent gang warfare. The police arrested Orlando - not for the murder of Tupac Shakur, but for the 12 April slaying of a man named Edward Webb, who had been attacked from behind at a party and shot dead by 'several black males'. Las Vegas detectives accompanied the Compton police, ready to question Orlando about the Tupac murder, but neither the Compton police nor the Las Vegas police department was able to turn the circumstantial evidence of the informants into anything that would make a case. In reality, much of their affidavit only detailed what members of Blood gangs and their associates at Death Row Records were saying about an alleged Crip. The Las Vegas police could not link Orlando to Tupac's murder, nor were the Compton police able to satisfy the district attorney that they had enough to hold him even for the murder of Edward Webb. DA Janet Moore ordered that Orlando be released. At the time, her spokesperson merely announced: 'We felt they needed to do some more work.' Three years later, and now employed in a different city, Moore refuses to go into the details of exactly why she made that decision. Orlando was free, but now he was publicly identified by the damning - yet ultimately inconclusive - evidence that had been leaked to the press. He became 'the man who shot Tupac'. Now when he went out, he realised people were looking at him. He would think: 'They know who I am.' One day, he sadly told his attorney: 'You know, I don't think I'm going to have a long life.' To be known as the man who shot Tupac leant a surreal edge to Orlando's life. Once, he was in Underworld Records, a shop in a run-down mini-mall on Alondra Boulevard. A girl in the store spotted a book on sale called The Killing of Tupac Shakur . The gaudy cover blared: 'WHO did it and WHY?' The girl looked at it contemptuously and mouthed off the latest conspiracy theory doing the rounds: 'Tupac's not dead. He's alive and living in Cuba.' The book, of course, contained a photo of Orlando, captioned. Suddenly, she looked up at the real Orlando. 'Damn!' she said. 'That's the guy who killed Tupac.' For a glorious second, everyone laughed. 'Didn't you just say Tupac was still alive?' someone said. The girl watched Orlando, unnerved. But by 1998, his reputation still hadn't killed him. Things seemed to be looking up. He would wake up early and take out his pit bulls, Blue and Na-Na, riding a bicycle along the sidewalks, with the dogs running behind. He and Rasheena had another daughter, Sierra. 'God is with me,' he would say. 'I'm not going to worry about it. I can't spend the rest of my life worrying about Tupac.' Success Records was finally starting to take shape. Orlando had found a garage in Compton to act as its HQ: he and Pooh built a studio in there, and Orlando had begun recording local talent. 'Orlando had a vision,' says Greg Cross, owner of Underworld Records, a local mom-and-pop store, and a close friend of Eazy E's. Cross claims he was Orlando's business adviser. 'He was a very quiet-natured person.' His words echo what I've heard from so many others. Orlando was well-loved around here; everyone says he was generous and charismatic and not at all violent. I ask Cross how Orlando, an unemployed man with four daughters, could afford to set up his studio. 'It was the money from the lawsuit,' he says vaguely. When I press him, he sighs and says, 'Well, it's no secret. Death Row had made some payments to him. That's the money he was using.' In 1995, Suge had pleaded guilty to two counts of assault stemming from a vicious 1992 attack on two young would-be rappers he had caught using a telephone without his permission in his studio. He was still on parole when the hotel security-camera video clearly showed Suge taking part in Tupac's assault on Orlando. Legal authorities had been looking for something they could use to put Suge behind bars. Orlando was subpoenaed to appear as a witness at Suge's parole hearings. When interviewed by Las Vegas police, Orlando had plainly told them Suge had assaulted him. But on the witness stand, he reversed his testimony. Suge was 'the only one I heard saying, \"Stop this shit!\"' As presiding Los Angeles Superior Court judge J Stephen Czuleger noted, Orlando was obviously lying. The rumours began spreading that Suge had paid off Orlando. And there was no doubt that for a man with no job, Orlando always seemed to have cash during his last year alive. Rappers all over LA remember how he would turn up with champagne. 'The guy used to reach into his pockets every time he saw us,' says one of Coolio's MCs, Mayno, who met Orlando two months before his death. 'One time, he bought us a big gallon of R\u00e9my. Man, we drank it until it was gone, and then he went and got some more.' Orlando's attorney, Ren\u00e9e Campbell, denies that her client received any payoff. 'He hadn't been paid anything by Suge Knight,' she told me, flatly contradicting Greg Cross. Campbell says that Orlando was simply too terrified for his life to testify against Suge. 'He lived a life of complete fear,' she says. (Knight's attorney, David Kenner, has not responded to repeated requests for comment.) Not that Campbell isn't partisan. She is, after all, pursuing a suit against the estate of Tupac Shakur, Death Row Records, Suge Knight and other unidentified persons for compensation for the injuries that Orlando received in the assault. She is seeking punitive damages on behalf of Orlando's estate. I ask Pooh about the rumours that Suge paid Orlando to testify in his favour. 'I know nothing about that,' he says, taken aback. 'As a matter of fact - that's so ridiculous. Where is the money, then? I'm sure his kids need it.' Pooh says that the financial investment in the studio was entirely his own. Pooh had worked as an extra and appeared in a TV commercial, and had saved enough to provide the seed money. Orlando's role was to deliver the talent and the industry contacts. 'He was the one who knew everyone in rap,' says Pooh. That Orlando bought champagne for people in the business he wanted to impress isn't that unusual. It's how business is often done in the hip hop industry. The money, Pooh insists, probably came from family members who felt sorry for Orlando. 'Our family - we're not desperate and poverty-stricken!' he says. The hidden inference enrages him. 'If he's an African-American male and he doesn't work from nine to five, then he is a murderer?' he asks me. South Central can be like a maze. Rumours take on a life of their own. In this divided place, whispers and innuendo turn half-truths into hard fact. On 29 May last year, Utah Williams, the 85-year-old matriarch at the heart of Orlando's family, died in the hospital where she'd been taken after a fall. Orlando's mother Charlotte remained at the hospital, so Orlando, who had been waiting for her at the family home, decided to go out and get a burger with an old friend, Michael Reed Dorrough. A little after 3pm, driving a borrowed Chevvy Blazer, he pulled into the parking lot of Cigs Record Store, at the intersection of Alondra and Oleander. This is Corner Pocket Crip territory, directly to the east of South Side territory. Though both groups are Crips, they are rivals. According to the police, Orlando spotted Michael Stone at a car wash across the intersection and confronted him about money that Orlando believed Michael owed him. Michael was accompanied by his nephew, Jerry Stone. Tempers rose, and a gunfight erupted. All four were hit; Orlando and the Stones were all fatally injured. With Dorrough in the passenger seat, Orlando tried to drive to safety. He only made it a few blocks, to the corner of Willowbrook and Cocoa, on the far side of Compton High, before lapsing into unconsciousness. The three were pronounced dead at the Martin Luther King Jr-Drew Medical Center - the hospital locals call it 'Killer King' because so many of the young men who go there, often with gunshot wounds, are dead by the time they leave. Around 4pm that day, the pagers began to go off. News of Orlando's shooting spread fast. A rapper friend of his rushed to the scene. He noted that the police hadn't even taped off the shot-up Blazer. To him, it was as if they didn't even think Orlando was worth it. 'What happened?' he asked a cop. 'Well, the guys from the South Side and the Corner Pockets got into it. Jerry Stone and Orlando Anderson are dead.' Then he said something like, 'They took a job of work off our hands.' Orlando's friend looked at the cop and thought, 'That's fucked up.' Then he walked over and looked at the bullet holes in the Blazer and imagined where the bullets had hit and ricocheted. Pooh had been driving to an audition in Hollywood when his pager flashed up '911' - the US telephone code for emergency services. By the time he made it to King-Drew, Orlando was dead. Pooh reeled from the shock of losing the two people he loved the most - Utah and Orlando - in a single day. It didn't seem real. Originally, police appeared to believe that it was Jerry Stone who fired the first shot. Greg Cross believes that it was Orlando's reputation as the man who killed Tupac which led to the fire-fight. Cross knew all four people involved in the shooting. He reckons that when Jerry Stone saw Orlando arguing with his uncle, he pulled his gun, thinking, 'Man. This is the guy that killed Tupac. I got to be quick with the draw.' But in the opening days of Dorrough's trial for murder in July 1999, the prosecuting attorney presented eye-witness and forensic evidence suggesting that Orlando had fired the first shot. Dorrough used Orlando's gun to return fire. When I called Pooh to tell him this news, it was like a bombshell. All along he had believed his brother was unarmed. Pooh steadfastly refuses to believe that his brother was armed, or fired the first shot. 'It's impossible,' he says, clearly shocked. He thinks the police have it all wrong, just as he thinks they were wrong when they named Orlando as the possible murderer of Tupac Shakur. His voice is choked. It sounds like he's crying. This is the third time his brother has been accused of shooting someone: first Edward Webb, then Tupac, now the Stones. Now he's dead, thinks Pooh cynically, they say they have conclusive evidence against him. Dorrough was found guilty of murder. His attorney remains unhappy about the case. She has been pressing for a re-trial. Like Pooh, she believes that the evidence presented by the prosecution is unreliable. But re-trials are rare. Las Vegas police admit that they have no suspects in the Shakur case, though they've never ruled out Orlando, either. 'You don't consider him as a suspect, but you haven't ruled him out?' I ask Sergeant Kevin Manning, the detective assigned to the case. 'It may be a play on words, a little bit,' he says, 'but that's just the way we do business.' The Compton police have backed away from linking Orlando to Tupac's murder. Though initial rumours had suggested that the Bloods from the North had fingered him as the killer, that now seems less likely. If they really believed what they were claiming, they'd have killed him long before a Crip did in May 1998. However, Compton police still insist that at the time of Orlando's death they were in the process of building a case against him for the murder of Edward Webb. Pooh thinks it's about race and politics. 'Orlando Anderson is an African-American. Do you think that if there was one shred of evidence against an African-American male of his age, that he would not be behind bars right at this moment?' I want to believe Pooh, though it's hard to share the faith he has in his brother. I know, at least, that people found it a little too easy to fit Orlando into their picture of a killer from a failing inner city. He was a grainy face on a security video, a minor player from a place outsiders expect to be full of killers. They know. After all, they've heard all the CDs. In a way, that's the trouble. Real life and art became confused. People on the South Side still blame Tupac for the whole situation. They believe he was the one who stoked the gang animosities: he was the reason people feared for their lives when they saw Orlando, and that Orlando, in turn, feared for his own. 'Tupac started everything,' says one of Orlando's friends. 'You got to hate him for what he started. For Orlando to be a fan of someone and not know him, and then for Tupac to come up to Orlando with some gang stuff.' To me, that's the root of it all. He was trying to live out his lyrics too much. Tupac crossed the line by coming up and saying, ' You from the South?

It features Kevin Spacey as Lester Burnham, a docile, corporate employee cum suburban father - the picture of white-collar American 'bliss'. <p><b> Hang on. Isn't Spacey more used to playing the bad guy, like he did as the satanic Verbal Kint in The Usual Suspects ?</b> Quite. This marks a new departure for Spacey, and by all accounts, he's quite good at being nice, particularly when it's satirical. American Beauty is a scathing attack on the drab conformity of middle America. The film opens with Lester lying prostrate on his bed, mourning his dull life. The next scene finds him tending to himself in the shower, describing this self-gratification as the 'highlight of [his] day'. True to his dysfunctional neighbourhood, Lester is infatuated with Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari), a local cheerleader and friend of his daughter Jane, played by Thora Birch. Next door lives the teenage voyeur Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley) and, on the other side, the two Jims, a tax lawyer and anaesthetist who describe themselves as 'partners', and who are constantly being asked what business it is they're in together. Faced with all this, Jane resorts to the usual teenage irreverence, \u00e0 la Christina Ricci. For example, when her father asks, 'So Janie, how was school?', the sarcastic reply is, 'It was spectacular, Dad.' To top it all, Lester's marriage is loveless, and turning poisonous. </p> <p><b> How does anyone survive all this torpor? </b> Well, Lester finds a new lease of life through weight lifting, insulting his employers, smoking weed with Ricky Fitts, buying a red 1970s Firebird, and laying down the law with his selfish wife Carolyn (Annette Bening). </p> <p><b> So, who's responsible?</b> The vacuity of modern capitalism, of course. </p> <p><b> No, no. Who made the film?</b> It's the directing debut of Sam Mendes, UK theatre's hottest export. He's the man behind the Broadway spectacular The Blue Room - sadly better known for Nicole Kidman's nude antics than for its dramatic qualities. According to Entertainment Weekly, American Beauty is an 'exquisitely designed, rather kinky tragicomedy'. The New York Times found it 'brilliantly staged', and so far, it is an early favourite for the Oscars. And, if it wins, it will even spare us Gwyneth Paltrow's acceptance speech blubbing.</p>",

A quarter of a century after the introduction of the Sex Discrimination Act, all I want for the millennium is an equal say.

Bendy, prey-turned-hunter, was patrolling the muggy night with his crew, offering to show the press where the Attach\u00e9s lived, to seek them out and hew them to pieces. Now, says Bendy, Lavelas - once the party of hope against the Attach\u00e9s - 'is like a chopped worm, crawling about itself in pieces'.</p> <p>And life in the Cit\u00e9 Soleil is worse and harder than ever. The authorities empowered by the US invasion have become a tragic joke. Two weeks ago 402 shanty huts were burnt down after a savage vendetta by a local gang. Nothing has been done.</p> <p>The gang warfare ripping through the shanties is fuelled by what has replaced politics post-Aristide: prostitution, drugs and ritual.</p> <p>Before they torched her house, the incinerators took Marie Erat's two children Wilson and Vera, and 'pushed them against a dead boy's body so they would not forget the lesson'.</p> <p>'This was my house,' says old Olest St Victoire, who once had nothing and now has less, wearing a US Navy cap in the charred shell of what was once a ghastly home but home none the less. 'I have only my hat, shirt and trousers. They even burnt my shoes and social security card.'</p> <p>The truth that lies behind this violence is that the US-created police force is dysfunctional, with some 900 officers dismissed for corruption and human rights violations. The judiciary is a tragi-farce: 80 per cent of prisoners await trial.</p> <p>Economically the news is just as bad. Sixty per cent of factories have closed: no one is interested in swallowing the pills of economic reform. 'If you are in a sinking ship and you jump out are you really saved?' asks Georges Sassine, vice president of the Association of Haitian Industries, who had to close his own factory, laying off 260 last year.</p> <p>The Attach\u00e9s and former puppet masters of C\u00e9dras are biding their time in wealthy suburbs that overlook the slums. In 1994, in the chic 'Bali' disco, Paul Dalmacy made no bones about being 'Macoute' at heart. Now he sips pi\u00f1a coladas at an expensive hotel spitting anti-American rage and pledging merciless revenge against 'collaborators' and 'traitors. When the times comes round again.'</p> <p>The Attach\u00e9s have a keen ear for rumours that Aristide may stand for re-election in next year's presidential vote, and should win. 'Au revoir Titid' reads one defiant graffiti in Attach\u00e9s territory, '\u00e0 bientot'.</p> <p>And there has emerged another threat. It is evident in Jacmel, an old coffee port on Haiti's southern shore, which is a target for the latest corrosion of an already rotten society - the adoption of Haiti by Colombian cocaine cartels as their export hub to the US.</p> <p>Haiti is the perfect lawless merry-go-round for their speedboats and global positioning systems. This has generated gang war in the shanties and Rolls Royces atop the hills, but also unexpected fortunes as peasants become overnight millionaires after finding a fraction of the vast quantities drifting ashore - now one fifth of all cocaine passing to the US.</p> <p>Jean-Charles Duffaut is fourth generation in a line of distinguished painters from Jacmel and relates how 'people have thought the cocaine was flour and made bread with it - they didn't sleep for days'.</p> <p>Sunrise in Jacmel is greeted by a new kind of beach-combing, as people trawl the shoreline for what they call le main du ciel , the hand of heaven. But most of the powder either finds its intended destination or enriches the very people charged with stopping it from doing so. Senior police officers have been dismissed for joining the search on the beaches with sat-phones.</p> <p>Jean-Charles ponders the American departure with the ambivalence of a society where people are mutilated with machetes and flowers painted on walls.' He recalls a Creole proverb: Derrie mon gen mon (behind the mountain more mountains). It goes on and on, the nightmare of being Haitian.</p> <p>And as for the rocks: a few of them are still there, piled on the body of the rapist in the market place, his stench now sickly another five hours later. The corpse is now alone in the dust but for casually passing shoppers and the pig that has begun to gorge on his lifeless, rubbery limbs.</p> <p>The jury and executioners have, however, left their calling card: a thick, sturdy bamboo stuck up his ass.</p>",

Two weeks ago 402 shanty huts were burnt down after a savage vendetta by a local gang. Nothing has been done. The gang warfare ripping through the shanties is fuelled by what has replaced politics post-Aristide: prostitution, drugs and ritual. Before they torched her house, the incinerators took Marie Erat's two children Wilson and Vera, and 'pushed them against a dead boy's body so they would not forget the lesson'. 'This was my house,' says old Olest St Victoire, who once had nothing and now has less, wearing a US Navy cap in the charred shell of what was once a ghastly home but home none the less. 'I have only my hat, shirt and trousers. They even burnt my shoes and social security card.' The truth that lies behind this violence is that the US-created police force is dysfunctional, with some 900 officers dismissed for corruption and human rights violations. The judiciary is a tragi-farce: 80 per cent of prisoners await trial. Economically the news is just as bad. Sixty per cent of factories have closed: no one is interested in swallowing the pills of economic reform. 'If you are in a sinking ship and you jump out are you really saved?' asks Georges Sassine, vice president of the Association of Haitian Industries, who had to close his own factory, laying off 260 last year. The Attach\u00e9s and former puppet masters of C\u00e9dras are biding their time in wealthy suburbs that overlook the slums. In 1994, in the chic 'Bali' disco, Paul Dalmacy made no bones about being 'Macoute' at heart. Now he sips pi\u00f1a coladas at an expensive hotel spitting anti-American rage and pledging merciless revenge against 'collaborators' and 'traitors. When the times comes round again.' The Attach\u00e9s have a keen ear for rumours that Aristide may stand for re-election in next year's presidential vote, and should win. 'Au revoir Titid' reads one defiant graffiti in Attach\u00e9s territory, '\u00e0 bientot'. And there has emerged another threat. It is evident in Jacmel, an old coffee port on Haiti's southern shore, which is a target for the latest corrosion of an already rotten society - the adoption of Haiti by Colombian cocaine cartels as their export hub to the US. Haiti is the perfect lawless merry-go-round for their speedboats and global positioning systems. This has generated gang war in the shanties and Rolls Royces atop the hills, but also unexpected fortunes as peasants become overnight millionaires after finding a fraction of the vast quantities drifting ashore - now one fifth of all cocaine passing to the US. Jean-Charles Duffaut is fourth generation in a line of distinguished painters from Jacmel and relates how 'people have thought the cocaine was flour and made bread with it - they didn't sleep for days'. Sunrise in Jacmel is greeted by a new kind of beach-combing, as people trawl the shoreline for what they call le main du ciel , the hand of heaven. But most of the powder either finds its intended destination or enriches the very people charged with stopping it from doing so. Senior police officers have been dismissed for joining the search on the beaches with sat-phones. Jean-Charles ponders the American departure with the ambivalence of a society where people are mutilated with machetes and flowers painted on walls.' He recalls a Creole proverb: Derrie mon gen mon (behind the mountain more mountains). It goes on and on, the nightmare of being Haitian. And as for the rocks: a few of them are still there, piled on the body of the rapist in the market place, his stench now sickly another five hours later. The corpse is now alone in the dust but for casually passing shoppers and the pig that has begun to gorge on his lifeless, rubbery limbs. The jury and executioners have, however, left their calling card: a thick, sturdy bamboo stuck up his ass.",

A handful of people have started to use the Internet centre regularly, because at 500CFA (the equivalent of 50p) it is much cheaper to send an e-mail to Bamako or Paris than to phone.</p> <p>Abdoul Malick, an unemployed youth, has found that he can even make a little money by logging on to news sites and printing out reports The bestseller of last year was the story which broke the week the centre started - Bill Clinton and Monica.</p> <p>'The Internet is not a luxury,' said Dr Ahmed Ba, a dentist. 'It allows us to be part of the world of science, because honestly at the moment we're not. We just have our basic training. It helps us get up to date with new methods of treatment, which are maybe simpler or more effective.'</p> <p>Timbuktu is one of the poorest places in Africa - many of the dental problems Ba sees are caused by malnutrition and vitamin deficiency.</p> <p>Africa has always inspired outsiders to dream up technical solutions to poverty, most of which have failed. An abandoned Norwegian frozen fish factory on the shores of Kenya's Lake Turkana is one of the most infamous monuments to the folly of foreigners. But while the Kenyans never expressed a desire for frozen fish, the educated people of Timbuktu do want to end their isolation.

      "bodyText": "Timbuktu is a town of myths and this is the latest: the Internet will catapult into modernity a place known since the late nineteenth century as 'the ends of the Earth'. Malle Diahara draws her white scarf round her head and taps into her computer at the Internet access centre. 'When I was little, we didn't have TV or the telephone, but I didn't know I was isolated,' she said. 'It's only now, with the Internet, that I feel it. The need to communicate never occurred to me before.' Diahara has the zeal of a convert. She is one of four young people who run the centre. 'With the new technology of the Internet, we can exchange experiences with others, and the way they do things can inspire us,' she said. Timbuktu has had the Internet for nearly a year now, and in a few months the connection will be made even faster. There are thrice-weekly flights to the capital of Mali, Bamako, but the road to Timbuktu is still cut every year when the River Niger floods, and transport is expensive. A handful of people have started to use the Internet centre regularly, because at 500CFA (the equivalent of 50p) it is much cheaper to send an e-mail to Bamako or Paris than to phone. Abdoul Malick, an unemployed youth, has found that he can even make a little money by logging on to news sites and printing out reports The bestseller of last year was the story which broke the week the centre started - Bill Clinton and Monica. 'The Internet is not a luxury,' said Dr Ahmed Ba, a dentist. 'It allows us to be part of the world of science, because honestly at the moment we're not. We just have our basic training. It helps us get up to date with new methods of treatment, which are maybe simpler or more effective.' Timbuktu is one of the poorest places in Africa - many of the dental problems Ba sees are caused by malnutrition and vitamin deficiency. Africa has always inspired outsiders to dream up technical solutions to poverty, most of which have failed. An abandoned Norwegian frozen fish factory on the shores of Kenya's Lake Turkana is one of the most infamous monuments to the folly of foreigners. But while the Kenyans never expressed a desire for frozen fish, the educated people of Timbuktu do want to end their isolation. The question is how. Half a millennium ago, Timbuktu was a seat of Islamic learning. A cross-roads between Africa, Europe and the Middle East, it boasted a university and hundreds of scholars. Now, after decades of decline and the Tuareg rebellion in the early Nineties, tourism has corrupted the culture. Children play truant from school, running through the dusty streets begging money from visitors. The evidence of Timbuktu's cultured past lies in about 20 private libraries, where thousands of handwritten documents in Arabic script are piled up in old cupboards, boxes and leather camel saddle bags. Some documents date back to the twelfth century, but most are from the sixteenth when Timbuktu was part of the Songhai Empire. They detail every aspect of life - astrology, religion, poetry, mathematics, music, commerce - a trove of information waiting to be studied. Abdel Kader Haidara's family have been collecting documents for generations. An American foundation gave him the money to build a library, which is due to open this week, so he can move his manuscripts from the outhouse where he has been keeping them. Soon he hopes to get computers so he can copy the documents on to CD-Rom and make them available on the Internet. Computers have brought Timbuktu into the information age, and may well have the potential to help the town preserve its heritage and overcome a legacy of neglect. but the key lies not in the technology, but in the skills and resources put into education and training to make it work. Lindsey Hilsum and Tim Lambon's film on the Internet in Timbuktu will be shown on Channel 4 News tonight at 7.30pm.",

      "body": "<p>In a small, dark, heavily guarded cell in Phnom Penh's main military prison sits a man of 74, wizened, white-haired, one-legged. He is in good health and surprisingly high spirits, given his grim future and grimmer past.</p> <p>He is Ta Mok, also known as the Butcher or Chhit Chouen - possibly the cruellest and most violent of the Khmer Rouge commanders who turned Cambodia's green countryside into the killing fields.</p> <p>The Prime Minister of Cambodia, Hun Sen, has hopes to try Ta Mok for his crimes next month. Many in his shattered country are happy at the prospect. Others, including many of the political leadership and bureaucracy, fear his testimony will unveil their own roles during the time of Pol Pot's genocide.</p> <p>The unease is not restricted to the small, desperately poor, swampy country of 10 million that is modern Cambodia. For when Ta Mok takes the stand, his lawyers promise, no one will be spared - least of all the Western leaders who, they say, supported the Khmer Rouge despite the Maoist extremists' atrocities being widely known.</p> <p>The most damaging element, for Britain at least, of Ta Mok's court appearance will be new evidence about how British troops and diplomats helped the Khmer Rouge in their fight for power.</p> <p>Contacted in his prison cell through an intermediary last week, he confirmed to The Observer that the extent to which London and Washington helped the Khmer Rouge in their fight to control Cambodia would be revealed during his trial. The evidence will contradict statements made by Margaret Thatcher's Government - which authorised the operation at the time.</p> <p>Ta Mok's lawyer, Benson Samay, said the court would hear details of how, between 1985 and 1989, the Special Air Service (SAS) ran a series of training camps for Khmer Rouge allies in Thailand close to the Cambodian border and created a 'sabotage battalion' of 250 experts in explosives and ambushes. Intelligence experts in Singapore also ran training courses, Samay said.</p> <p>To allow Ministers to deny helping the Khmer Rouge, the SAS was ordered to train only soldiers loyal to the ousted Prince Norodom Sihanouk, and the liberal democrat former Prime Minister, Son Sann, who were fighting alongside Pol Pot's Communists. However, Samay said the court would be told the Khmer Rouge benefited substantially from the British operation.</p> <p>'All these groups were fighting together - but the Khmer Rouge were in charge. They profited from any help to the others. If they had won the war outright, then Pol Pot would have been back in charge,' Samay said.</p> <p>The Khmer Rouge and their allies were fighting against the Vietnamese-backed puppet regime Hanoi had installed after ousting Pol Pot's extremist Communists and exposing the horrors of the killing fields.</p> <p>In a classic piece of Cold War realpolitik, Britain - prompted by the Americans - appears to have given military assistance to the Khmer Rouge-led coalition, despite knowing of Pol Pot's atrocities, in an attempt to limit the power of the Soviet-backed Vietnamese.</p> <p>'Thatcher, Reagan, Kissinger - they should all be on trial along with Ta Mok,' Samay said last week. He said the court would also hear that humanitarian supplies for Cambodian refugees in Thailand were diverted to the Khmer Rouge with, he claims, the knowledge of the Americans and the British. The court would also hear, he said, how the diplomatic support offered by London and Washington to the coalition led by the Khmer Rouge was 'a great help and morale booster' for Pol Pot's troops. The coalition retained the Cambodian United Nations seat throughout the Eighties.</p> <p>Ta Mok's journey from jungle hideout to power to hideout and eventually to prison last May is a powerful symbol of the political tides that have washed over Cambodia in the past decades. In April it will be 25 years since Pol Pot's Chinese-backed Maoist revolutionaries defeated a weak pro-US government and entered Phnom Penh. They themselves were ousted by the Soviet-backed Vietnamese four years later and for 15 years a vicious civil war - fuelled by Cold War politics - racked the country.</p> <p>The trial of Ta Mok and his Khmer Rouge colleague Kaing KhekIev (nicknamed 'Deuch') - who ran the regime's most notorious torture centre - is a litmus test for this deeply scarred nation. Arguments over the format of proceedings have yet to be resolved - the United Nations and human rights groups fear the trial will be used by the government for political ends or be a sham, or both. But it seems likely it will go ahead nevertheless. Few feel, however, that anyone will be pleased by the outcome.</p> <p>Not far from the prison where its former commander is being held, the Tuol Sleng torture centre still stands. Its iron beds, manacles and electric cables are intact, though tourists and groups of school children now walk wide-eyed through its cells.</p> <p>Overlooking the rusting barbed wire are the garish villas of the nouveaux riches who have successfully exploited Cambodia's recent shift towards a new, hugely corrupt, free-market economy. Outside its gates loiter half a dozen beggars - dirty children and disabled victims of the mines that still litter Cambodia's countryside - hoping to beg a few riels (Cambodia's virtually worthless currency) from wealthy farang (tourists).</p> <p>They know what should happen to Pol Pot's henchmen. 'They should all be punished,' said Pheach Yui, 35, who lost his leg to a mine while fighting against the Khmer Rouge 12 years ago. 'They should all be rounded up and judged and punished for their sins. They should be in jail until they die.'</p> <p>Yui is likely to be disappointed. There are thought to be 50,000 former Khmer Rouge fighters in government positions. At least five are Cabinet Ministers. Others have been effectively pardoned and live well. They include Ieng Sary, the Khmer Rouge number three and Pol Pot's brother-in-law, Nuon Chea, who was known as 'Brother Number Two' and Khieu Samphan, the movement's one-time Prime Minister.</p> <p>Even Ta Mok says that they should face punishment. 'I know about only a fraction of what happened,' he told The Observer through an intermediary. 'You should ask Ieng Sary and the others too.' Several key Khmer Rouge commanders are gen erals in the Cambodian army and look untouchable. Even the Prime Minister himself was a Khmer Rouge cadre until being recruited by the Vietnamese.</p> <p>Ta Mok and 'Deuch' may end up being the only senior Khmer Rouge brought to justice for their crimes. Pol Pot, the architect of the the massacres, died in 1998 and no one else has been arrested or is likely to be.</p> <p>Though some argue that 'national reconciliation' means forgetting the past, to many the failure to bring the Khmer Rouge killers to justice merely emphasises the cheapness of human life in Cambodia today.</p> <p>The psychological scars of genocide and war are obvious everywhere. The smallest incident can provoke extreme violence. The crime columns in the press are almost grotesque: three men blow themselves, and a caf\u00e9, to bits playing Russian roulette with an anti-tank mine; a man is murdered in a row over whether the millennium bug is a hoax; a syphilitic farmer kills five children and drinks their blood in the hope of being cured; a chess game ends with one dead, two badly injured. Arguments over land regularly lead to murder.</p> <p>Attacks with acid have become more common. Last month a government official's wife hideously burnt her husband's mistress by pouring five litres of nitric acid over her while bodyguards held the screaming woman down. Such 'crimes of jealousy' are increasing. Last summer Cambodia's most famous actress was shot dead in the street. The press reported that her murderers had been hired by the wife of the Prime Minister - her alleged lover.</p> <p>'There is an ingrained culture of might is right,' said one Western diplomat. 'It needs very little to spark off appalling violence.' Armed robbery is common and, as the police are corrupt and ineffectual, people take the law into their own hands. Vigilante killings are rou tine, with even novice monks and art students beating suspected robbers to death. The customs and the military, often with the co-operation of senior members of the government, collude in massive smuggling - of beer, drugs, people, tropical hardwood and the country's archaeological heritage.</p> <p>Cambodia has lost half its forests in the past 30 years, and the trees are still falling fast. Last year soldiers used heavy equipment to break up 30 tonnes of stone carvings from 1,000-year-old archaeological sites before loading them into army trucks and driving them to Thailand to sell to dealers with rich Western clients. The military have even been reported to have been extorting 'protection money' from those trying to conserve Angkor Wat - Cambodia's world-famous jungle temple complex.</p> <p>The level of development is appallingly low. Average life expectancy is 52, one in five children dies before reaching the age of five, more than a third of the population live below the poverty line and half the children show the effects of malnutrition. Aids killed 6,000 people last year. The elite's exclusive golf course, on the outskirts of Phomh Penh, charges $20,000 (\u00a312,000) for membership, 80 times the average income.</p> <p>Even the international community's well-meaning interventions often come unstuck. The UN peacekeeping operation hugely boosted Aids in the country and created a parallel dollar economy. A senior French aid worker was reported to be pimping the orphans in his care.</p> <p>Recently the partly British-funded Cambodian Mine Action Centre was found to have been clearing land for former Khmer Rouge warlords. They included Chhouk Rin - the commander who, in 1994, kidnapped and killed three Western tourists including a Briton.</p> <p>Khieu Phen is, like Ta Mok, an old man. He was 30 when the Khmer Rouge came to power and lost his brothers, sisters and brother-in-law in the massacres. He survived the killing fields - where he was forced to work 'day and night' and watched 'sons forced to murder their fathers' - by working harder than everyone else. Now he rides a scooter around Phnom Penh hoping to pick up a passenger and earn enough for a bowl of noodles.</p> <p>'Sometimes I think we are cursed,' he said. 'Everybody takes from this country.

The Arab with attitude, he is the hero of the graffiti-daubed housing estates. Now he's in big trouble.</p> <p>Jamel Debbouze, 23, filed a formal complaint against Paris police on Friday for 'violence leading to a certified incapacity to work for six days', warranting the appointment of an investigating magistrate.</p> <p>The comedian of Moroccan origin with his trademark withered right arm - the legacy of a boyhood dare on a railway line; it cost a close friend his life - is one of the hottest names in the French entertainment world. He presents one television series, stars in another, has just finished a successful show at a top Paris venue, Le Bataclan, and has two films in post-production. He is the idol of Paris's disaffected immigrant youth.</p> <p>Like footballer Nicolas Anelka, the star of last season's Arsenal side, Debbouzze grew up in the high-rise, low-income sprawl of Trappes on the outskirts of Paris. Like Anelka, he now makes enough to employ his brothers, buy houses for his parents, and drive Jaguars, Mercs and Porsches.</p> <p>On New Year's Day things went awry. Debbouze was returning after midnight from a millennium concert of Rai music for Paris's North African community, at which he had been guest of honour. Police tension around the gig was high - 2,000 young people had tried to get in without tickets.</p> <p>Versions of what happened next tend to differ. For the Debbouze camp - notably his brother Karim, press agent Nadia Mourine and her sister - a traffic policeman ordered the comedian to drive on through a red light, and then dragged him out of the car when Debbouze replied: 'You should ask a little more politely.'</p> <p>Mourine said: 'The cop opened the door and dragged Jamel out. He slammed him against the car three times. Then there was a crowd of traffic cops around him. One hit him on the neck with a walkie-talkie and another in the stomach with a truncheon. Jamel fainted.' Photographs taken of the incident by Debbouze's entourage made the front pages on Monday. The anti-racism group SOS-Racisme instantly declared the alleged attack a 'revolting act that reveals the shameful practices of public servants who believe themselves above the law'. The group said the police 'had it in for an Arab who has managed to succeed'.</p> <p>But this account does not tally with that of the police, who allege that Debbouze ignored instructions not to interfere with a police convoy escorting millennium-night Ferris wheels and stands out of the city.</p> <p>He was reportedly driving dangerously.

      "bodyText": "His one-man show has sold out every night for the past six months. Over the holiday he fronted three prime-time television shows in a row. The Arab with attitude, he is the hero of the graffiti-daubed housing estates. Now he's in big trouble. Jamel Debbouze, 23, filed a formal complaint against Paris police on Friday for 'violence leading to a certified incapacity to work for six days', warranting the appointment of an investigating magistrate. The comedian of Moroccan origin with his trademark withered right arm - the legacy of a boyhood dare on a railway line; it cost a close friend his life - is one of the hottest names in the French entertainment world. He presents one television series, stars in another, has just finished a successful show at a top Paris venue, Le Bataclan, and has two films in post-production. He is the idol of Paris's disaffected immigrant youth. Like footballer Nicolas Anelka, the star of last season's Arsenal side, Debbouzze grew up in the high-rise, low-income sprawl of Trappes on the outskirts of Paris. Like Anelka, he now makes enough to employ his brothers, buy houses for his parents, and drive Jaguars, Mercs and Porsches. On New Year's Day things went awry. Debbouze was returning after midnight from a millennium concert of Rai music for Paris's North African community, at which he had been guest of honour. Police tension around the gig was high - 2,000 young people had tried to get in without tickets. Versions of what happened next tend to differ. For the Debbouze camp - notably his brother Karim, press agent Nadia Mourine and her sister - a traffic policeman ordered the comedian to drive on through a red light, and then dragged him out of the car when Debbouze replied: 'You should ask a little more politely.' Mourine said: 'The cop opened the door and dragged Jamel out. He slammed him against the car three times. Then there was a crowd of traffic cops around him. One hit him on the neck with a walkie-talkie and another in the stomach with a truncheon. Jamel fainted.' Photographs taken of the incident by Debbouze's entourage made the front pages on Monday. The anti-racism group SOS-Racisme instantly declared the alleged attack a 'revolting act that reveals the shameful practices of public servants who believe themselves above the law'. The group said the police 'had it in for an Arab who has managed to succeed'. But this account does not tally with that of the police, who allege that Debbouze ignored instructions not to interfere with a police convoy escorting millennium-night Ferris wheels and stands out of the city. He was reportedly driving dangerously. Halted at a red light, he was asked for his papers and refused to hand them over. 'Don't push it too far, I'm on the 1 o'clock news tomorrow with the Interior Minister and I can get you fired,' he is alleged to have told one officer. Another swears Debbouze never lost consciousness, but was instructed to stay on the ground by his press agent while she took the apparently incriminating photos. Another denies blows were struck and insists no one did more than push Debbouze, who was 'over-excited, shouting and gesticulating and threatening in all directions'. Police have suggested that the German-registered Mercedes Debbouze was driving was not legal in France, that his driving licence was void, as he had failed to undergo the regular health tests needed because of his handicap, and that a student had complained of being assaulted by Debbouze the previous night in an apparent case of road rage. The inquiry will have to choose between two familiar phenomena: a notoriously heavy-handed police force frequently accused of racism and convicted last year of torture by the European Court of Human Rights, and a tendency among some black and Arab celebrities to insult the police at every opportunity. Whichever way the verdict goes this time, with regard to Debbouze, a comedian of elegant wit and fine inteligence, it will have a big impact on race relations in France.",

The boy then had a 30-minute meeting with the exiled Tibetan leader.</p> <p>The Karmapa, head of the Kagyu or 'black hat' sect of Tibetan Buddhism, is revered as a living Buddha by many Tibetans and considered second only to the Dalai Lama.</p> <p>For centuries it has been the Dalai Lama's sect, the Gelugpa or 'yellow hats', who have ruled Tibet. And traditionally when a Dalai Lama dies, it is then his appointed successor, the Panchen Lama - chosen from the yellow hats - who takes over.</p> <p>But the Panchen Lama is at the centre of a bitter dispute with the Chinese. Since 1995, Gedhun Choekyi, the 10-year-old boy nominated as Panchen by the Dalai Lama, has been kept under arrest by the Chinese, who then installed another 10-year-old boy, Gyaltsen Norbu, as their puppet Panchen. Tibetans see the second boy as a fake.</p> <p>The Karmapa's dramatic defection is, therefore, the most important of its kind since the Dalai Lama himself left in 1959 following the Chinese invasion and is extremely significant for the future of Tibet. In terms of age and experience the Karmapa will be more senior than the Panchen Lama, giving him a strong position to claim leadership of Tibet.</p> <p>This places the Dalai Lama in an awkward position, although it would mean that there was an agreed figurehead for the next generation of Tibetans. The Kagyu sect is now the most flourishing school in the West, with hundreds of Buddhist centres worldwide, thousands of followers and heavily endowed by Taiwanese supporters. His predecessor, the sixteenth Karmapa, helped establish monasteries from Woodstock to the Scottish highlands.</p> <p>The seventeenth Karmapa is also unique because he is the only lama recognized by both China and the Dalai Lama. Losing such an important spiritual leader is a severe embarrassment for the Chinese government, which was grooming him to become a patriotic leader who could legitimise their hard-line control of Tibet.

Now Beijing can only rely on their young Panchen Lama, seen by most Tibetans as a puppet.</p> <p>Significantly, however, the Chinese official news agency, Xinhua, has not condemned the Karmapa's sudden departure - implying the door is still open should he wish to return. Xinhua cited a letter written by the boy, saying he did not mean to betray 'the state, the nation, the monastery or the leadership' by leaving. His reason, according to the letter, was to retrieve various sacred objects, including the venerated black hats, from Rumtek monastery in the north Indian state of Sikkim.</p> <p>In Sikkim yesterday, monks from Rumtek monastery, the exile seat of the sixteenth Karmapa, were celebrating their leader's return. For the Karmapa to step fully into his power as an eminent spiritual leader it is absolutely vital he retrieves these religious artefacts used by previous 'incarnations'.

Another of the Karmapa's roles is to make small black pills called ril nak, said to have miraculous properties, multiplying overnight and giving remission during cases of terminal illness. The ingredients for these pills are also in Rumtek monastery in Sikkim.</p> <p>The Karmapa began his clandestine escape from Tibet with four monks on 28 December.

He had been kept under increasingly tight guard, nominally for his own security after an alleged assassination attempt on his life last year, in his ancient monastery, Tsurphu, 50 miles from the Tibetan capital, Lhasa. It is unlikely the Karmapa left because of direct persecution, as the Dalai Lama did 40 years ago.</p> <p>The Karmapa's unannounced arrival places the Dalai Lama in an awkward position as he usually encourages all Tibetans who flee to exile to return to Tibet.</p> <p>'If bridges are not burnt between the Dalai Lama and Beijing, the Karmapa may decide to go back,' says Richard Oppenheimer from Tibet Information Network in London.</p> <p>'China will use all pressure possible on the Indian government to force him to return.'

He was described as a gifted and clairvoyant child who was taken into a local monastery for special education. Traditionally a new incarnation of the Karmapa is found through signs in a written form, usually a letter left by his predecessor.

So why is it that at this time of year so many people manage to convince themselves that spending \u00a3500 or more to join a fitness club will get them in shape? </p> <p>Carole Seheult, a sports psychologist at Durham University, puts it down to a sort of puritan work-ethic approach: 'People think that getting fit is a chore requiring some kind of sacrifice - paying for it adds to the feeling that they are taking their punishment.' </p> <p>'There's also a sense that if you've paid \u00a3600 or whatever, you must be healthier,' says Di Swanston of the Health Education Authority. But does this sort of skewed logic help you to stick to a new fitness regime? </p> <p>Not according to Kathryn Leigh, fitness editor of Health and Fitness magazine. She says: 'Even the clubs know that most people won't stick it out much beyond February.' This may account for the large joining fees that most clubs charge (see below). </p> <p>'But getting fit doesn't need to cost you anything at all,' says Swanston. 'The biggest mistake people make is assuming that physical activity has to be vigorous to be beneficial.' </p> <p>Research shows that moderate exercise - an activity, such as brisk walking, that leaves you 'feeling warm and breathing more heavily than usual' - is just as good, provided you do it three to four times every week. </p> <p>Of course, fitness clubs have their place, but if you've never set foot in one before, Leigh recommends trying out your local council-run leisure centre before committing yourself to a year-long membership of a private club. 'Local authorities are a bit more on the ball these days,' she says. Many offer the same kind of facilities as private clubs, including such extras as saunas, spa baths and steam rooms. </p> <p>Going to a local authority-run club isn't free, but because you pay as you go it can work out a lot cheaper. </p> <p>This is a particularly important consideration when you are just embarking on a fitness regime and haven't yet built up to the recommended level of exercising three to four times a week. For example, if you swim once a week for a year, going to a public pool might cost a total of \u00a3100. This is about \u00a3400 less than the yearly cost of the cheapest private club. </p> <p>Even if you manage three swims a week, the public pool option will still save you about \u00a3150. But once you're going that often, you can save even more by buying a season ticket for the public pool. </p> <p>Aerobics classes are a different matter, and whether you will get a better deal by paying as you go depends largely on where you live. Londoners doing three classes a week at a central leisure centre could spend nearly \u00a3600 a year, which is slightly more than the cost of joining a private club. Residents of Leeds doing the same number of classes would spend about \u00a3400 to work out at a local authority-run exercise studio. Compared with the cheapest private club (which means no pool) the pay-as-you-go option is still a better deal. </p> <p>Wherever you live, if you go to the gym only once a week, you'll be better off by paying as you go. Once you become a model three-times-a-week gym-goer, the cost per session at a private club is again cheaper for Londoners, but not for people who live in Leeds. </p> <p>On top of the cost of the facilities for your chosen exercise there is the kit to consider. If you want to look the part when swim ming, expect to pay about \u00a340 in total for a Speedo Endurance Piped Splashback swimsuit (which Speedo claims lasts 20 times longer than ordinary swimwear, and is quick drying and chlorine-resistant), an Adidas swimming cap (with zip-up storage case) and Adidas Missionary Z goggles (with anti-fog lenses and Neoprene eye cups). </p> <p>Don't expect to get much change out of \u00a3100 if you plan to go to the gym or do aerobics, because proper trainers are essential.

Many clubs offer a free day's trial. </p> <p> \u0095 Take out a joint or off-peak membership. This can often halve both the joining and the membership fee. </p> <p> \u0095 Wait for a new club to open in your area. For example, Fitness First (which, in January, is opening around nine new clubs up and down the country) waives its \u00a3100 joining fee if you sign up in the first month. LA Fitness and Virgin Active offer special rates to people who sign up before a new club opens. </p> <p> \u0095 Agree to pay annually rather than monthly. Living Well clubs offer 12 months' membership for the price of 11 if you pay as a lump sum. </p> <p> \u0095 Avoid clubs with swimming pools if you don't like swimming. Access to a pool pushes up the cost. </p> <p> \u0095 Look out for special promotions. You're most likely to see discounts at times when clubs are quiet - usually in the summer and before Christmas. But some clubs may offer discounts on joining fees to take advantage of the interest caused by New Year resolutions. </p> <p> \u0095 Go more than three times a week. With even the most expensive clubs, this will bring the price per session down to about what you would pay at a leisure centre. To work this out for yourself multiply the number of times a week you realistically expect to go by 45 (which allows seven weeks for sickness and holidays) then divide that by the total fees. </p> <p><strong> How to keep at it: top tips</strong><br> You're not going to get your money's worth - or get fit - if you give up after a month or two.

      "body": "<p>When the time comes to buy your next car - new or secondhand - you will do yourself a big favour if, rather than rushing out to a showroom, you stay indoors and spend a little time on the Internet. </p> <p>Whether you want a discount on a brand-new vehicle - sourced in the UK or abroad - or free access to thousands of small ads for used vehicles, there are websites galore. </p> <p>Although, like everything to do with e-commerce, these are early days, the growing importance of the Internet in bringing price competition into car buying can already be seen in the decision by Mitsubishi, announced at the end of last year, to lower its list prices. The pressure on other manufacturers is set to increase. The Competition Commission is shortly due to report to the Department of Trade and Industry on its inquiry into new car pricing. </p> <p>The Consumers' Association, which has spearheaded the campaign to bring new car prices down in the UK, believes the Internet is of central importance. 'People are fed up, and looking at other ways to buy. The Internet will play a significant role in how to buy a car in the future,' the association's Jenny Driscoll says. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.fletcherresearch.com\" target=\"_new\">Fletcher Research</a> predicts that one in five new cars will be bought with the aid of the Internet by 2003. 'Aid' is a key word here: people generally use the Internet as a way of finding the lowest price, rather than to carry out a full transaction, and most sites are designed to direct customers to dealers' showrooms. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.autobytel.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">Autobytel UK</a>, an arm of the US operation, has had 10,000 purchase requests in the UK since setting up here last April. But that is from 65 million hits on its site. Although a lot more people are looking rather than buying, the business is confident that in time it will convert more of those hits into deals. It offers a free service for customers, allowing them to place a request online for new, used and business cars.

      "bodyText": "When the time comes to buy your next car - new or secondhand - you will do yourself a big favour if, rather than rushing out to a showroom, you stay indoors and spend a little time on the Internet. Whether you want a discount on a brand-new vehicle - sourced in the UK or abroad - or free access to thousands of small ads for used vehicles, there are websites galore. Although, like everything to do with e-commerce, these are early days, the growing importance of the Internet in bringing price competition into car buying can already be seen in the decision by Mitsubishi, announced at the end of last year, to lower its list prices. The pressure on other manufacturers is set to increase. The Competition Commission is shortly due to report to the Department of Trade and Industry on its inquiry into new car pricing. The Consumers' Association, which has spearheaded the campaign to bring new car prices down in the UK, believes the Internet is of central importance. 'People are fed up, and looking at other ways to buy. The Internet will play a significant role in how to buy a car in the future,' the association's Jenny Driscoll says. Fletcher Research predicts that one in five new cars will be bought with the aid of the Internet by 2003. 'Aid' is a key word here: people generally use the Internet as a way of finding the lowest price, rather than to carry out a full transaction, and most sites are designed to direct customers to dealers' showrooms. Autobytel UK, an arm of the US operation, has had 10,000 purchase requests in the UK since setting up here last April. But that is from 65 million hits on its site. Although a lot more people are looking rather than buying, the business is confident that in time it will convert more of those hits into deals. It offers a free service for customers, allowing them to place a request online for new, used and business cars. This request is passed on to the nearest Autobytel-accredited dealer, who then contacts the prospective buyer. There are some similar home-grown services, such as New Cars Direct or CarDeal. Both look throughout the UK for the best price for the make and model you require, the latter charging a \u00a310 fee. CarDeal says that it will refund your fee if it is unable to find your car or if it is unable to beat a quote you obtain yourself. New Cars Direct says it achieves its discounts by ordering in bulk - including orders for fleet buyers, traditional recipients of the best car deals in this country. The website of the magazine Auto Trader has details of more than 180,000 used vehicles, and offers a new car service and advice on financing and other issues.

Rising interest rates and the final abolition of Miras (mortgage interest relief at source) are expected to slow increases this year, preventing a runaway housing boom. </p> <p>But despite these negative influences, economists and estate agencies are predicting strong rises.

The good news for prospective buyers is that property will remain good value, despite increases. Parry says: 'An average house is currently worth around three times annual average earnings, which is considerably below the peak of five times in 1989. And although standard variable mortgage rates are likely to rise next year, they will remain far below the 14.5 per cent reached in 1989. </p> <p>'This means that even with the demise of Miras, the proportion of post-tax income necessary to cover a first time buyer's mortgage repayments will remain around 15 per cent, compared with more than 22 per cent in the late Eighties.' </p> <p>Demand in the first six months of this year could be fuelled by a 'new millennium, new home' mindset, according to David Woodcock of Bradford &amp; Bingley Estate Agents. However, he expects the market to 'pause for breath' in the second half of the year, resulting in a national average increase of about 7 per cent for the whole year. </p> <p>In London, house price growth is expected to slow markedly. Gary Styles of the Halifax says there will be a more even pattern across the country with prices rising more rapidly in regions dependent on manufacturing as that sector recovers from its recent recession. </p> <p>But he adds: 'Prices are still expected to increase most quickly in the South as the economy there remains buoyant. So the North-South divide is set to widen further during 2000.' </p> <p>Ian Davies of Bradford &amp; Bingley's southern regional office says there has also been a resurgence of people buying second homes - for investment purposes or as holiday properties. 'This trend is particularly noticeable in the West Country, and we believe the best is yet to come.' </p> <p>The shortage of properties has led to knock-on demand in towns within 100 miles of London. Prices in Norfolk and the Midlands rose by about 10 per cent, while the average rise in Oxford, Cambridge, Hertfordshire, Buckinghamshire and Essex was 20 per cent. Alan Gottschalk, also of Bradford &amp; Bingley, predicts that if a shortage of quality properties and the positive economic environment continue, prices will go up by another 10-15 per cent. </p> <p>Prices for homes in the country also escalated dramatically last year - by up to 20 per cent in the South East during the first half of 1999, according to estate agent Knight Frank, where Edward Rook says: 'There is a strong correlation between country house prices and the stock market. As we have seen less volatility with the stock markets, confidence has grown in the housing market.' </p> <p>He does not think rises in the South East during the Year 2000 will exceed 10 per cent, but adds: 'Buyers are looking for space, setting and views, and, to get these, they are prepared to travel further.

But we were persuaded that everything would be all right on the night. The story is not over. Over coming months, computers may make bug-related mistakes. The possibility of them being major ones must be diminished by the absence of panic and disaster so far. The Financial Services Authority chose the week before Christmas to make its low-key response to concerns over mis-selling of endowments, confident the news would be buried - as it was. But the issue comes into focus afresh this week with the announcement of endowment bonuses. There will be more cuts, so more home owners could face shortfalls on their mortgages. The FSA is not recommending a review of all sales but homeowners should take matters into their own hands. If they believe they were not warned sufficiently of the risks they should approach the Personal Investment Authority Ombudsman.",

It shows that the Government accepts that subsidies should be used in such high-risk markets. </p> <p>Warwick University's Stoneman says: 'Launch Aid is a classic example of the Government intervening in a highly risky area - aerospace.

These vary across activities and sectors: for example, there are European subsidies for training and environmental protection, and there are regional funds for the most deprived parts of the EU. But the Commission is wary of subsidies in the sectors that have traditionally received them, such as steel, car making, textiles, shipbuilding and coal. </p> <p>There have been complaints about handouts to the coal industries of Germany and Spain. </p> <p>And UK aid to BMW could land the Government in difficulty unless it is accepted that there was a real risk of BMW moving the operation to Hungary. This deal has also attracted criticism at home, despite the Government's claims that the package includes incentives to raise productivity at the plant. New Labour has moved beyond these programmes with a series of micro-economic measures - generally tax reliefs for business, not standard subsidies. But they deal with the same problem - market failure and risk. </p> <p>Chancellor Gordon Brown has introduced enhanced capital allowances to encourage small businesses to invest, and has eased capital gains tax. He has introduced a tax credit on research and development, and tax incentives for employee share ownership schemes. </p> <p>Steve Bond of the Institute for Fiscal Studies says these initiatives prove that the Government is becoming far more interventionist than the Conservatives were. 'This policy agenda rests on two premises: that the market misallocates resources between small firms and large firms; and that spending small amounts of taxpayers' money can make a significant improvement,' he says. 'Hard evidence for either premise is thin on the ground.' </p> <p>Warwick's Stoneman suggests these British Government initiatives are actually not enough like subsidies. He points to Holland and Finland, where government gives to small, risky businesses on the same basis as UK Launch Aid - no-win, no-fee. </p> <p>Here, perhaps is the big problem for the Government. Too much coherence could look too much like subsidy, and could attract the attention of the commission. But lack of coherence can actually distort aid programmes. </p> <p>Coal provides perhaps the best example of such contortions. The crisis of 1997 was resolved not through a handout but by rigging the - admittedly imperfect - market, preventing the construction of gas power-plants, which threaten coal mines. The result: the Government produces the outcome - overriding the market - which is the text-book reason for not allowing subsidies in the first place. </p> <p>This time around, coalfield MPs realise there's no chance of cash, so they have taken a subtler approach: they're arguing that the Government should help investment in environmental equipment to power stations so they can burn more coal. </p> <p>The problem is that these interventions are stretching the golden rule: intervention and subsidies work with, not against, the market. </p> <p>As ever, then, the conundrum is how to decide what to assist, and how to justify it. Last month in its Competitiveness Index, the Department of Trade and Industry made clear that it admired the success of the partnership between US government and business, and saw it as an important part of the knowledge-based economy. </p> <p>Alan Hughes, the Margaret Thatcher Professor of Enterprise Studies at Oxford University, believes there is a simple way to do this - better subsidies for universities. </p> <p>He points to the successful collaboration of academics and business in the US, Germany and France. The difference with the UK? Funding, both of facilities and staff. </p> <p>Hughes says: 'If you want a knowledge-based economy, you have to fund the production of the knowledge.' </p> <p>That approach has advantages: the European Commission could not object, and it will sit comfortably in New Labour's economic lexicon - under the heading 'e' for education spending.</p>",

The problem is that these interventions are stretching the golden rule: intervention and subsidies work with, not against, the market. As ever, then, the conundrum is how to decide what to assist, and how to justify it. Last month in its Competitiveness Index, the Department of Trade and Industry made clear that it admired the success of the partnership between US government and business, and saw it as an important part of the knowledge-based economy. Alan Hughes, the Margaret Thatcher Professor of Enterprise Studies at Oxford University, believes there is a simple way to do this - better subsidies for universities. He points to the successful collaboration of academics and business in the US, Germany and France. The difference with the UK? Funding, both of facilities and staff. Hughes says: 'If you want a knowledge-based economy, you have to fund the production of the knowledge.' That approach has advantages: the European Commission could not object, and it will sit comfortably in New Labour's economic lexicon - under the heading 'e' for education spending.",

Plucked from obscurity at merchant bank Warburgs in the Eighties, Richard Carr followed a trail blazed by Lord White at Hanson the decade before. </p> <p>In 1987, he was not even a Warburg director. But over the next six years, Carr built the US arm of Greg Hutchings' Tomkins conglomerate into a multi-billion pound empire, along the way snapping up gunmaker Smith &amp; Wesson among a quickfire series of deals. Carr's reward, on his return to Britain, was an eyecatching \u00a310 million bonus, a staggering sum six years ago. </p> <p>In late 1994, after leaving Tomkins, the shy, slightly built dealmaker sought to repeat his success at TransTec, a small Midlands engineering group assembled by Geoffrey Robinson.</p> <p> Today, that ambition is dead, as receiver Arthur Andersen picks over TransTec's remains. Carr, 47 next Monday, has gone to ground after quitting abruptly ahead of Christmas Eve, when TransTec's shares were suspended after the board's discovery of accounting irregularities involving an undisclosed \u00a311.2m claim from Ford, the group's biggest customer. </p> <p>Last week, during an Observer investigation, repeated attempts to contact Carr at his Stratford-upon-Avon home and via the firm and former colleagues came to nought. Nor could former finance director Bill Jeffrey, who also quit, be contacted to answer questions in a widening probe into TransTec's 'Fordgate' affair. </p> <p>Ford has yet to furnish the receivers with key documents which will shed further light on the affair. There is no evidence to suggest Ford was aware of any lack of disclosure within TransTec. </p> <p>According to TransTec and City sources there is also no evidence to suggest Robinson knew of the alleged irregularities, nor, according to Ford, was Robinson involved in the negotiations over the claim. </p> <p>In retrospect, Carr might feel his fall was fated. TransTec was hardly the most auspicious vehicle for a second glittering career. It started out as Central &amp; Sheerwood , a property outfit that was part of Robert Maxwell's private empire and nearly went bust in the Eighties. In 1991, Robinson controversially reversed his private Transfer Technology firm into C&amp;S, emerging with a hefty stake that still stands at just over 16 per cent. </p> <p>But by 1994, after a string of disappointments, the City was clamouring for the future Paymaster General to split the role of chairman and chief executive. 'Carr was the bees' knees at Tomkins. He came highly recommended,' one former TransTec adviser said. </p> <p>Carr set about realising his vision, splashing out on deals in the UK, US, Spain and Australia. By 1997, sales had doubled to \u00a3350m, losses of \u00a312m were turned to a \u00a317m profit and TransTec's shares had trebled to a record 120p. By late 1997, however, with the strong pound hitting the motor industry, TransTec was under severe pressure. Debt ballooned past \u00a365m in mid-1999, breaching banking covenants. </p> <p>In September worried bankers and US bondholders formed a steering group comprising HSBC, Bank One of the US and Boston law firm Bingham Dana. This group, The Observer can reveal, asked accountant Arthur Andersen to investigate TransTec's financial position. 'By then there was significant anti-management tension at the banks, just waiting to snap,' one City source said. </p> <p>With trading bad and cash tight, the board brought in debt negotiators and corporate financiers from Close Brothers, the City merchant bank that handled the Brent Walker collapse. In November, while working on refinancing and disposal, Close, in turn, brought in the business regeneration unit of TransTec's auditor, PriceWaterhouseCoopers, to get a grip at ground level. </p> <p>Last week, neither would comment on their role. But The Observer has established that both advisers became increasingly concerned at the situation they found. 'They were helping to negotiate with creditors. Clearly it was in no one's interest for TransTec to go down. In doing that, the roads led the accountants to Ford,' one source said. </p> <p>A cornerstone of Carr's dream of a world-leading auto-components group was a new factory in Northern Ireland, at Campsie near Londonderry, commissioned in 1996 to make over \u00a320m a year of single overhead camshafts for the six-cylinder engine version of Ford's four-wheel-drive Explorer model. </p> <p>From its factory at Louisville, Kentucky, Ford turns out 500,000 Explorers a year and Campsie was crucial for a quarter of that. But from the start, the plant - which received government grants - suffered commissioning problems, cost-overruns and delivery delays. 'When you go to an area to set up a highly automated factory, you need skills and they simply weren't there,' said TransTec chairman Colin Cooke. 'You should never just follow the grants.' </p> <p>What Cooke and his predecessor Richard Rimington - who took over from Robinson in May 1997 - deny is any knowledge that from late 1996 Ford had lodged claims for compensation under its contract. Through two audits, in 1997 and 1998, according to City sources, PwC's audit team were not told of the Ford claim. Andersen, put in by the banks before a new \u00a370m facility was agreed last October, also missed the problem. </p> <p>During December, sources say, PwC's new team found something unexplained among all the paperwork: 'debit notes' from Ford, which claimed discounts on invoices issued by TransTec subsidiaries, including TransTec Automotive (Campsie) Ltd, which ran the Ulster plant. </p> <p>Inquiries at Ford Europe's purchasing department in Cologne established that Carr had negotiated with Ford over the \u00a311.2m Campsie penalty for almost a year until a deal was reached in autumn 1997. Ford says it has a written agreement following correspondence with Carr to that effect. The debit notes, the PwC team found were set off against the $100m a year of Ford business the group was doing, not just Campsie. Sources say that made the origin of the claim hard to track. </p> <p>In all, \u00a37.5m of the claim passed through the group's 1998 accounts, with \u00a35.5m charged against profits and \u00a32m capitalised as tooling expenditure. In late 1999, Ford issued more debit notes on the penalty's \u00a33.7m balance. </p> <p>'If you look through the 1998 accounts, and the exceptionals items in subsidiaries, nothing leads you to realise it all related to Ford at Campsie,' one source said. 'Only more digging did that.' </p> <p>On 15 and 16 December the advisers, Cooke and the board confronted Carr and Jeffrey, who was group finance director before moving to TransTec's Australian operations in March last year. </p> <p>'They confirmed a series of discussions had taken place with Ford over this liability. Other directors confirmed they were unaware,' one source said. 'In their defence, they said the accounting treatment truly reflected the commercial arrangement with Ford,' said another. </p> <p>At a further board meeting late on 23 December, Carr and Jeffrey resigned, leaving just one executive - current finance director Richard Parkin - on the board. At 6.5p on Christmas Eve, shares were suspended. For the banks, it was the final straw. Close Brothers' advice to trade on was rejected, financial support was withdrawn and the receivers went in. </p> <p>This weekend, as Andersen prepares for a sell-off, shareholders, bondholders and creditors are considering their hand. Had the full Ford claim been recognised when it arose, TransTec's profits, reputation and share price would have been dented and the firm would have looked less attractive to investors. </p>",

      "body": "<p>Geoffrey Robinson, the colourful and controversial MP for Coventry North West, may well feel cursed. Certainly, the golden boy has lost his Midas touch. A year after the home loan scandal that cost him and Peter Mandelson their government jobs, TransTec's demise has now robbed Robinson of a chunk of his personal fortune. </p> <p>Not that the indefatigable Labour bankroller, who still owns two Lutyens mansions, the New Statesman magazine and a large chunk of Coventry football club, will cry over spilt milk for too long. Robinson made his luck by being in the right, if sometime controversial, place at the right time. </p> <p>His early rise was rapid. After a spell with Harold Wilson's Industrial Reorganisation Corporation in the 1970s, Robinson joined British Leyland, becoming chief executive of Jaguar in 1973 at just 34. He was elected to his safe Coventry seat three years later, and in the 1980s forged a relationship with publisher Robert Maxwell. </p> <p>In the week of the TransTec revelations, Robinson was cleared by the DTI of false accounting at Hollis Industries, a collapsed Maxwell firm that he chaired. This was not the only link with Maxwell. In 1991, the publisher chaired TransTec, then called Transfer Technology, after a deft piece of financial engineering saw another of the publisher's firms absorb Robinson's private interests at a fancy price. </p> <p>In 1994, Robinson's fortunes were further bolstered by a lottery-style \u00a312.75m bequest on the death of Joska Bourgeois, a Belgian multi-millionairess who ran Jaguar franchises on the Continent. </p> <p>The way Robinson held his TransTec and Belgian fortunes - in offshore trusts - caused further, predictable, controversy after his long-coveted government appointment in May 1997. Tax havens and a Treasury minister were a godsend to press and Tories alike. </p> <p>Then, last March, he was also roundly rebuked for the third time by the Commons Standards and Privileges Committee for failing to declare all his business interests. Five months previously, Robinson provoked uproar after delivering a Commons apology in the most perfunctory of ways. </p> <p>With the media scenting blood again, TransTec, City sources and Ford say there is no evidence Robinson knew of the alleged accounting irregularities. Indeed, he was no longer on the board when the firm's chief executive settled with Ford in late 1997. Robinson was, however, still chairman in 1996 when the Campsie problem first arose.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Geoffrey Robinson, the colourful and controversial MP for Coventry North West, may well feel cursed. Certainly, the golden boy has lost his Midas touch. A year after the home loan scandal that cost him and Peter Mandelson their government jobs, TransTec's demise has now robbed Robinson of a chunk of his personal fortune. Not that the indefatigable Labour bankroller, who still owns two Lutyens mansions, the New Statesman magazine and a large chunk of Coventry football club, will cry over spilt milk for too long. Robinson made his luck by being in the right, if sometime controversial, place at the right time. His early rise was rapid. After a spell with Harold Wilson's Industrial Reorganisation Corporation in the 1970s, Robinson joined British Leyland, becoming chief executive of Jaguar in 1973 at just 34. He was elected to his safe Coventry seat three years later, and in the 1980s forged a relationship with publisher Robert Maxwell. In the week of the TransTec revelations, Robinson was cleared by the DTI of false accounting at Hollis Industries, a collapsed Maxwell firm that he chaired. This was not the only link with Maxwell. In 1991, the publisher chaired TransTec, then called Transfer Technology, after a deft piece of financial engineering saw another of the publisher's firms absorb Robinson's private interests at a fancy price. In 1994, Robinson's fortunes were further bolstered by a lottery-style \u00a312.75m bequest on the death of Joska Bourgeois, a Belgian multi-millionairess who ran Jaguar franchises on the Continent. The way Robinson held his TransTec and Belgian fortunes - in offshore trusts - caused further, predictable, controversy after his long-coveted government appointment in May 1997. Tax havens and a Treasury minister were a godsend to press and Tories alike. Then, last March, he was also roundly rebuked for the third time by the Commons Standards and Privileges Committee for failing to declare all his business interests. Five months previously, Robinson provoked uproar after delivering a Commons apology in the most perfunctory of ways. With the media scenting blood again, TransTec, City sources and Ford say there is no evidence Robinson knew of the alleged accounting irregularities. Indeed, he was no longer on the board when the firm's chief executive settled with Ford in late 1997. Robinson was, however, still chairman in 1996 when the Campsie problem first arose.",

Specialist US investment vehicles such as Cross Atlantic and the Carlisle Group - which today appointed Tim Jackson, founder of QXL, as managing director - are giving financial backing to fledgling UK Internet firms with a view to floating them. </p> <p>The Internet itself has played a part in fuelling the excitement. The number of online investors in the UK rose from around 250,000 to 400,000 last year, with the majority buying Internet and IT-related stocks. This was not the easiest thing to do. Last year only around a dozen Internet companies floated on the UK markets. </p> <p>Lack of equity was cited as one of the reasons why the share prices of Internet firms went through the roof. UK investors are likely to find it a little easier this year to jump on the Internet bandwagon, according to investment group Durlacher. It predicts that around 50 Internet companies will float in the UK in the next 12 months. </p> <p>Robert Conway, global technology industry leader at PricewaterhouseCoopers, said: 'The Internet boom is going to continue. Clearly there will be a lot of IPOs (initial public offerings) but they will not be the only vehicle for Internet companies coming to market. I forecast consolidation and a lot more merger and acquisition activity.

Egg, the Prudential's online banking arm, looks a good bet. Some analysts speculate that the Financial Times's online operation, FT.com, could soon be spun off from Pearson. </p> <p>Others will come out of Internet incubators - holding companies which buy into online companies and fatten them up by injecting new management, cash and services. </p> <p>But will the sector's bubble burst as more equity becomes available? Analysts think this is unlikely. Alex Birch of OC&amp;C Strategy Consulting, which advises firms on their Internet tactics, said: 'All of the quality offers so far have been massively oversubscribed. There is clearly huge appetite for risk in this area.' </p> <p>However, investors' nerves will be tested over the next 12 months as the Internet sector suffers jitters. Individuals trading online make for a volatile market; the prospect of interest rate rises looks set to be a permanent spectre; and there is always the danger that companies such as Amazon will not meet expectations. </p> <p>But if 2000 is likely to be the year of the Internet IPO (around 600 are predicted for the US) it is also set to be the year when the market becomes more discerning. The City is likely to become much less interested in the e-retailer and far more appreciative of less glamorous Internet companies. </p> <p>Miles Saltiel, director of technology research at WestLB Panmure, believes that talking of Internet companies in generic terms is practically meaningless. His team now divides Internet companies into five categories: backroom firms - companies that specialise in software for online payments are an obvious example; businesses which use the Internet to build new markets - such as eBay the US auction house; content providers; Internet access providers; and companies which change strategy in order to buy and sell to other firms directly online - the 'business-to-business' model. </p> <p>Saltiel is especially bullish about firms which fall into the first and last categories. These companies differ greatly from those which came to market last year: 'Some seem to have a business model which has been: go to market, get capital, spend it on advertising, then go back to the market for more money.' </p> <p>Finding Internet companies built on more than hot air is no mean feat. Scores of the near-300 US firms which IPO'd last year sank without trace.

Last week, as news of the channel's slow but steady progress in capturing ratings filtered out, its shareholders were bidding to up their stakes in the company - an exercise that valued it at around \u00a31.2 billion. </p> <p>When merchant banker Anthony Fry speculated that C5 would be worth \u00a31bn within three years of its launch, on Easter Sunday 1997, few thought his prediction would come true. The immense problems the channel faced in retuning the nation's video recorders and its annual budget of \u00a3110m for programming did not bode well for building public confidence and a stable audience. ITV, freely spending \u00a3800m a year, and Channel 4, with its new-found enthusiasm for the sex-and-death formats that helped launch C5, both seemed formidable opponents. Surely the channel was doomed to failure. </p> <p>So what went right? David Elstein, C5's chief executive, puts it down to the science of television. </p> <p>'It is simply logic. What we have done is refined our schedule, learnt by our mistakes and kept at it. In Britain we have such a conservative audience that we can predict - sometimes to one tenth of a percentage point - what our weekly audience will be. What we have done is counter-punched against the ITV schedule and that is how we have improved our numbers.' </p> <p>Elstein dismisses the handy claim that C5 is all about 'films, fucking and football' - a phrase used but not, Elstein says, coined by C5's head of programmes, Dawn Airey. </p> <p>'Football has practically no impact on our overall viewing - it might provide very handy spikes in our weekly audiences but overall it has contributed very little,' he says. 'Similarly the soft porn films in the evening. What undoubtedly does well for us are films in the 9 o'clock slot.' </p> <p>He adds to the list the staple programmes that may not have caused a stir at the Baftas but are drawing enough eyes to the screen to keep C5 ahead of schedule: Night Fever, the grim karaoke show; Fort Boyard, the copy of Crystal Maze enhanced by Melinda Messenger, Dirty Den and some real tigers; even the revived It's a Knockout. </p> <p>Reading down the roll call of C5 favourites, it is almost certainly true that industry commentators and other executives probably watch very little of the output - there is nothing there to incite a single wag from the tongue of one member of the chattering classes. Unless of course it is to repeat the out-dated jokes about snowstorm reception or the mildly titillating nature of its late-night programming. </p> <p>What offends the sensitivities of those who prefer to prate about TV rather than watch it is that C5 is almost shockingly dedicated to achieving audience targets and financial results. It pays lip service but little more to manufacturing television that matters, that has some significance beyond half-an-hour's diverting entertainment. The nearest C5 is likely to get to a costume drama is a woman in, or preferably out of, a swimsuit. It has unashamedly championed the return of Miss World to our screens and will continue to focus its documentary output on controversial and slightly prurient subjects like the Moors Murderers. Even the much-copied Channel 5 News, which made Kirsty Young a \u00a31m star who was poached by ITV, is not sacrosanct. </p> <p>'Every time we move it in the schedules it gets a bigger audience and I would move it again if I could,' says Elstein. His belief is that it should run at 5.30pm, and the channel has further ambitions for sprucing up its early evening schedule, including an as yet unannounced coup in buying a well-known programme from one of its competitors. </p> <p>This week Elstein appears in front of the Independent Television Commission chief executive Peter Rogers and his panel to answer questions relating to the annual assessment of the performance of all the commercial terrestrial franchise holders. Elstein says he would be very surprised if there were to be anything more than the mildest criticism of the network's output. </p> <p>Industry analysts put a large part of the company's success down to Airey and her genius for scheduling, and the strength of the sales department under Nick Milligan. </p> <p>'Those two are very much the stars of the show and the channel's success will depend on an ability to hold on to them,' says one source. </p> <p>Elstein confirms that one of the cornerstones of C5's good results has been 'to keep together a very tight, loyal, motivated team'. The management currently enjoys 'shadow' share options and with existing shareholders consolidating their holdings it seems highly unlikely that the channel will now be floated on the stock market this year, or indeed next. </p> <p>A bigger question may revolve around who will ultimately control the company. The appointment of ITV chief executive Richard Eyre as head of Pearson TV - one of C5's three big shareholders - has galvanised speculation that the company is ready to wrest control of the whole shooting match. This may be made easier by the fact that another shareholder, United News and Media, is attempting to merge with Carlton Communications. This might force United to lower its interest in C5 if the competition authorities see fit. With a single shareholder and big bucks behind it, the prospects for C5 could be very interesting. </p> <p>But then, as Elstein puts it, the low-cost nature of C5 has made it surprisingly fresh. Kirsty is poached by ITV, so the station decides to promote a new unknown, Andrea Cathewood, as its new face. It picks up formats that cannot find room in the schedules of its richer competitors and it hits the opposition when they are not looking. </p> <p>'We make programmes for \u00a3120,000 an hour - they make programmes for \u00a3240,000 an hour. Why would they ever want to buy any of our shows?' says Elstein.

      "body": "<p>If you've ever thought that buildings aren't as well lit as they used to be, don't worry. You're not suffering from nostalgia: modern buildings are badly lit - by design. </p> <p> The result has been a loss of efficiency. And workers in the worst lit class of buildings - call centres - may be suffering long-term damage to their health. </p> <p>Many of the problems can be traced to a misunderstanding that is proving very difficult to eradicate: office blocks are often equipped with lighting that is designed to a safety standard, not a comfort standard. Moreover, the size of the buildings limits the amount of daylight getting in. This is especially problematic for the increasing number of people working unusual shifts: lighting that would be adequate by day plays havoc with their circadian rhythms, causing long-term damage. </p> <p> 'Some of the ways we are working now are unhealthy by design,' says Roger Spiller of the Manufacturing, Science and Finance union (MSF). 'Businesses don't think of the stress they are causing, but they'll get away with it until the epidemiologists catch up with them.' </p> <p> However, the situation is about to improve in some ways, because new buildings are now being planned to let in more daylight. </p> <p>But in other ways it may get worse, warns Jonathan David of the Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers (CIBSE). He worries that the planned European standardisation of lighting standards will turn CIBSE's Lighting Guide Category 2 into a standard - particularly for 'speculative offices', built by a developer on a speculative basis, then furbished before a buyer is sought. </p> <p> 'It was never meant to be a standard for working,' he says. 'It was a fallback for speculative offices. It doesn't cause problems under all conditions, but it doesn't provide good lighting. It's gloomy: there's no light on the walls.' </p> <p> The guide was meant to advise on necessary levels of lighting for safe working. It was designed to let people see hazards and judge their position. Unfortunately, says David: 'Manufacturers have started making products to that standard. I always tell them to ignore it.' </p> <p> Too little light thrown on walls means that, except on objects immediately under the lighting, the room is dim. This limits glare, one of the two major problems in lighting (the other is reflection). </p> <p> But light does more than make things visible. </p> <p> 'Sunlight supplies vitamins, and suppresses melatonin,' says Adrian Hallam, of Adrian Hallam Architects, the RIBA's special adviser on light. 'Melatonin is a soporific. It tells you when it's dark it is time to sleep. When sunlight hits the eye, melatonin production is suppressed and you become alert. Several forms of artificial light [most light bulbs and fluorescent tubes, for example] don't do this.' </p> <p>Hallam says that if you look at a graph showing the visible spectrum of natural light, it's like a plateau - but 'fluorescent light is like shark's teeth'. He cites early studies done on Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) in the 1960s. </p> <p>'In Stockholm you could go to work in the dark and be deep in a building until you went home. People complained of feeling drowsy all the time. Now most GPs will tell you they have a stock of patients they have to help through the winter.' </p> <p>Hallam points out: 'In Germany, workers have the right to be within six metres of natural daylight.' </p> <p>But why exactly do we want natural light? 'The light energy from daylight is the least important part of it,' says Professor Peter Tregenza of Sheffield University. </p> <p>There are two main priorities: to able to see outside (the reason why supermarkets so often have large windows looking on to boring car parks) and, if you are inside, to maintain contact with the outside through light falling on cupboards, desks and other surfaces. </p> <p>'It is seeing outside that gives the satisfaction,' says Tregenza. 'Light falling on surfaces is the next thing people need. It is contact with outside, with the changes in light telling them what time it is and what the weather is like.' People deprived of light - kept in interrogation rooms or dungeons, for example - can very quickly become disoriented and depressed. </p> <p> In a properly lit building electrical lighting only provides 'task lighting', Tregenza adds. Artificial light will be there to support the natural light - not to replace it. 'Daylight falls on surfaces. The artificial lighting must not mask the daylight.' </p> <p>But there have always been people who have worked away from daylight. So why has this deficiency not been pointed out before?

      "bodyText": "If you've ever thought that buildings aren't as well lit as they used to be, don't worry. You're not suffering from nostalgia: modern buildings are badly lit - by design. The result has been a loss of efficiency. And workers in the worst lit class of buildings - call centres - may be suffering long-term damage to their health. Many of the problems can be traced to a misunderstanding that is proving very difficult to eradicate: office blocks are often equipped with lighting that is designed to a safety standard, not a comfort standard. Moreover, the size of the buildings limits the amount of daylight getting in. This is especially problematic for the increasing number of people working unusual shifts: lighting that would be adequate by day plays havoc with their circadian rhythms, causing long-term damage. 'Some of the ways we are working now are unhealthy by design,' says Roger Spiller of the Manufacturing, Science and Finance union (MSF). 'Businesses don't think of the stress they are causing, but they'll get away with it until the epidemiologists catch up with them.' However, the situation is about to improve in some ways, because new buildings are now being planned to let in more daylight. But in other ways it may get worse, warns Jonathan David of the Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers (CIBSE). He worries that the planned European standardisation of lighting standards will turn CIBSE's Lighting Guide Category 2 into a standard - particularly for 'speculative offices', built by a developer on a speculative basis, then furbished before a buyer is sought. 'It was never meant to be a standard for working,' he says. 'It was a fallback for speculative offices. It doesn't cause problems under all conditions, but it doesn't provide good lighting. It's gloomy: there's no light on the walls.' The guide was meant to advise on necessary levels of lighting for safe working. It was designed to let people see hazards and judge their position. Unfortunately, says David: 'Manufacturers have started making products to that standard. I always tell them to ignore it.' Too little light thrown on walls means that, except on objects immediately under the lighting, the room is dim. This limits glare, one of the two major problems in lighting (the other is reflection). But light does more than make things visible. 'Sunlight supplies vitamins, and suppresses melatonin,' says Adrian Hallam, of Adrian Hallam Architects, the RIBA's special adviser on light. 'Melatonin is a soporific. It tells you when it's dark it is time to sleep. When sunlight hits the eye, melatonin production is suppressed and you become alert. Several forms of artificial light [most light bulbs and fluorescent tubes, for example] don't do this.' Hallam says that if you look at a graph showing the visible spectrum of natural light, it's like a plateau - but 'fluorescent light is like shark's teeth'. He cites early studies done on Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) in the 1960s. 'In Stockholm you could go to work in the dark and be deep in a building until you went home. People complained of feeling drowsy all the time. Now most GPs will tell you they have a stock of patients they have to help through the winter.' Hallam points out: 'In Germany, workers have the right to be within six metres of natural daylight.' But why exactly do we want natural light? 'The light energy from daylight is the least important part of it,' says Professor Peter Tregenza of Sheffield University. There are two main priorities: to able to see outside (the reason why supermarkets so often have large windows looking on to boring car parks) and, if you are inside, to maintain contact with the outside through light falling on cupboards, desks and other surfaces. 'It is seeing outside that gives the satisfaction,' says Tregenza. 'Light falling on surfaces is the next thing people need. It is contact with outside, with the changes in light telling them what time it is and what the weather is like.' People deprived of light - kept in interrogation rooms or dungeons, for example - can very quickly become disoriented and depressed. In a properly lit building electrical lighting only provides 'task lighting', Tregenza adds. Artificial light will be there to support the natural light - not to replace it. 'Daylight falls on surfaces. The artificial lighting must not mask the daylight.' But there have always been people who have worked away from daylight. So why has this deficiency not been pointed out before? Perhaps because it was universal in some industries, and its effects could be attributed to other causes: miners have never been noted for their good industrial relations, for example. Night nurses have desk lamps, and move to brightly lit operating theatres to deal with emergencies. Shift workers in call centres are a new and growing group, and most are affected by bad lighting. Lighting is kept dim so as not to interfere with VDU screens. 'It should be at least as bright as daylight, so as not to interfere with their circadian rhythms,' says MSF's Spiller. But that would limit their ability to see the screens. 'These are workers working in a deliberately unhealthy environment. The Working Time Directive says work must be designed to fit the worker, but the British Government has not implemented that part of it.' Making office lighting comfortable may sound rather 'soft'. Workplaces, employers may say, are there for people to earn money, not to provide a pretty window. But such employers are doing themselves a disservice. Uncomfortable employees tire easily, and are short-tempered, easily distracted and rebellious. It is odd that the lighting lessons used in animal husbandry have never been applied to the human workplace. In farming it is used to make sheep breed twice a year rather than once. This may not seem immediately applicable, but it does show the very real affect that lighting has on the brain. How to brighten your day 1. Move nearer to a window. 2. Adjust your position so you get the least reflection and glare: move your computer monitor; raise your seat; move your desk if you can. 3. Adjust your monitor to a level that suits you. 4. Get your union rep to speak to the buildings manager: It may be possible to adjust the levels of lighting. 5. If the office is being redecorated: ask for light-coloured paint or paper on surfaces that will catch daylight. 6. Change jobs - and ask for a guided tour before you accept your new one.

Born in near poverty, denied higher education, and refused recognition during his early life, the naturalist was afflicted by hardships that would have broken most men. Even after becoming a biologist he suffered appalling misfortune: a ship fire destroyed his priceless Amazon specimens, he contracted malaria, was maimed in a gun accident, and lost a brother to yellow fever. </p> <p>Yet Wallace endured and became a noted collector of rare animal and plant specimens; invented the science of biogeography, the study of animal distribution; and, in a fitting response to 'the ague', cracked the secret of natural selection in the midst of a malarial fever. He became a supporter of women's rights, socialism, land nationalisation, and - in case you thought he was too good to be true - spiritualism. As E.O. Wilson states in a prologue to Archipelago , Wallace succeeded because he was 'an intense young man, totally focused, awesomely persistent, resilient to tropical disease that killed so many others, and nobly selfless'. </p> <p>However, his greatest achievement remains the unravelling of natural selection, a theory that still obsesses humanity - though we usually associate its principles with its co-discoverer, Charles Darwin, with whom Wallace announced joint success in their breakthrough at the Linnean Society in London in 1858. Their intellectual bombshell reverberates today, with books on evolution still making bestseller lists, while biographies of Darwin are now a publishing industry in their own right.</p> <p>By contrast, Wallace has been shunned, although he was by far the most interesting of evolution's early proponents. Dismissed - quite unfairly - as the 'moon to Darwin's sun' who accidentally stumbled on the truth, he has only recently begun to receive proper credit, a good example of this being The Spice Islands Voyage (Little Brown, 1997), Tim Severin's account of how he traced Wallace's second great journey round Indonesia. Now we have two more: an elegant volume on Wallace's early career by Sandy Knapp, a Natural History Museum expert on South American botany; and a lavish, coffee-table tome on his later journeys by conservationists Gavan Daws and Marty Fujita.</p> <p>Each neatly complements the other. For example, Knapp quickly demolishes the notion that Wallace was somehow lucky. From the outset of his voyaging, he recorded his desire to solve 'the problem of [the] origin of species', not an easy task for an uneducated lad from Usk, in Monmouthshire, the eighth child of a failed businessman. First Wallace had to educate himself (in reading rooms and at evening classes), later becoming a teacher and finally a land surveyor before using a \u00a3100 pay-off to finance his 1848 trip to South America. </p> <p>In the Amazon, he drew superb maps and magnificent depictions of the fauna and flora, collected rare species, and constantly asked himself fundamental biological questions. 'What are the circumstances which render certain rivers and mountain ranges the limits of numerous species, while others not? What physical features determine the boundaries of species?' Wallace wrote in his notebooks. This was a young man with evolution on his mind.</p> <p>The work was intellectually exhilarating but dangerous. Wallace blew part of his hand off in a gun accident and was plagued by insects and vampire bats.

      "bodyText": "Footsteps in the Forest: Alfred Russel Wallace in the Amazon Sandra Knapp Natural History Museum \u00a316.95, pp90 Buy it at BOL Archipelago: The Islands of Indonesia Gavan Daws and Marty Fujita University of California \u00a327.50, pp275 Buy it at BOL Few men have led lives that inspire so dramatically as Alfred Russel Wallace's. Born in near poverty, denied higher education, and refused recognition during his early life, the naturalist was afflicted by hardships that would have broken most men. Even after becoming a biologist he suffered appalling misfortune: a ship fire destroyed his priceless Amazon specimens, he contracted malaria, was maimed in a gun accident, and lost a brother to yellow fever. Yet Wallace endured and became a noted collector of rare animal and plant specimens; invented the science of biogeography, the study of animal distribution; and, in a fitting response to 'the ague', cracked the secret of natural selection in the midst of a malarial fever. He became a supporter of women's rights, socialism, land nationalisation, and - in case you thought he was too good to be true - spiritualism. As E.O. Wilson states in a prologue to Archipelago , Wallace succeeded because he was 'an intense young man, totally focused, awesomely persistent, resilient to tropical disease that killed so many others, and nobly selfless'. However, his greatest achievement remains the unravelling of natural selection, a theory that still obsesses humanity - though we usually associate its principles with its co-discoverer, Charles Darwin, with whom Wallace announced joint success in their breakthrough at the Linnean Society in London in 1858. Their intellectual bombshell reverberates today, with books on evolution still making bestseller lists, while biographies of Darwin are now a publishing industry in their own right. By contrast, Wallace has been shunned, although he was by far the most interesting of evolution's early proponents. Dismissed - quite unfairly - as the 'moon to Darwin's sun' who accidentally stumbled on the truth, he has only recently begun to receive proper credit, a good example of this being The Spice Islands Voyage (Little Brown, 1997), Tim Severin's account of how he traced Wallace's second great journey round Indonesia. Now we have two more: an elegant volume on Wallace's early career by Sandy Knapp, a Natural History Museum expert on South American botany; and a lavish, coffee-table tome on his later journeys by conservationists Gavan Daws and Marty Fujita. Each neatly complements the other. For example, Knapp quickly demolishes the notion that Wallace was somehow lucky. From the outset of his voyaging, he recorded his desire to solve 'the problem of [the] origin of species', not an easy task for an uneducated lad from Usk, in Monmouthshire, the eighth child of a failed businessman. First Wallace had to educate himself (in reading rooms and at evening classes), later becoming a teacher and finally a land surveyor before using a \u00a3100 pay-off to finance his 1848 trip to South America. In the Amazon, he drew superb maps and magnificent depictions of the fauna and flora, collected rare species, and constantly asked himself fundamental biological questions. 'What are the circumstances which render certain rivers and mountain ranges the limits of numerous species, while others not? What physical features determine the boundaries of species?' Wallace wrote in his notebooks. This was a young man with evolution on his mind. The work was intellectually exhilarating but dangerous. Wallace blew part of his hand off in a gun accident and was plagued by insects and vampire bats. After four years, he had had enough, and set off home, with cases of specimens, monkeys, and a menagerie of parrots, macaws, and a toucan. In mid-Atlantic, the brig Helen caught fire and everyone took to the boats. Of his goods, only two notebooks and a parrot survived. 'I had not one specimen to illustrate the unknown lands I had trod,' he recalled. Knapp imbues her narrative with authority and tells her tale with admirably brevity, crisscrossing her account with abundant quotes from Wallace's letters and drawings from his two surviving notebooks.

      "body": "<p><strong>The Marriage Of Souls</strong><br>Warwick Collins<br>Weidenfeld &amp; Nicholson, \u00a316.99, pp482<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502284587,00.html\" target=\"_NEW\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>Every now and then, a writer emerges who just gets better and better. These are the really exciting ones to encounter. Their novels carry the promise of so much more to come. Warwick Collins is one such writer. He is the author of several novels and each has been an extraordinary improvement on the last. The Rationalist marked Collins out as a writer who would be able to challenge the supremacy of Hilary Mantel, Rose Tremain and Ferdinand Mount. The Marriage of Souls confirms that he has arrived. </p> <p>The Marriage of Souls, like The Rationalist, is an exploration of humanist philosophy wrapped between the delicate leaves of an eighteenth-century tale. The story of the two novels - and they should be read as a two-volume work - centres around the old war-horse of boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy finds girl. But what a boy and what a girl. </p> <p> The Marriage of Souls is set in Lymington, on the Solent. The year is 1798. The French Revolution and its aftermath has filled the town with hundreds of French \u00e9migr\u00e9s who bring with them money and foreign ways. The salt furnaces provide wealth and jobs but they destroy those who work in them. Although the town is picturesque, the forces maintaining it are dangerous and uncontrollable. </p> <p>The novel begins with the disappointing information that the future happiness and reconciliation promised in The Rationalist failed to materialise. Silas Grange, the Scottish doctor who would prefer to live and die by David Hume, has suffered a mental and physical collapse. Mrs Celia Quill, the enigmatic stranger who seemed poised to unlock the constraints around his rational heart, has departed suddenly and without trace. Dr Hargood, Grange's best friend and mentor, carries inside him the burden of guilt and knowledge.</p> <p>What makes The Marriage of Souls such a wonderful book is Collins's intricate reconstruction of the late eighteenth-century world.

      "bodyText": "The Marriage Of Souls Warwick Collins Weidenfeld &amp; Nicholson, \u00a316.99, pp482 Buy it at BOL Every now and then, a writer emerges who just gets better and better. These are the really exciting ones to encounter. Their novels carry the promise of so much more to come. Warwick Collins is one such writer. He is the author of several novels and each has been an extraordinary improvement on the last. The Rationalist marked Collins out as a writer who would be able to challenge the supremacy of Hilary Mantel, Rose Tremain and Ferdinand Mount. The Marriage of Souls confirms that he has arrived. The Marriage of Souls, like The Rationalist, is an exploration of humanist philosophy wrapped between the delicate leaves of an eighteenth-century tale. The story of the two novels - and they should be read as a two-volume work - centres around the old war-horse of boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy finds girl. But what a boy and what a girl. The Marriage of Souls is set in Lymington, on the Solent. The year is 1798. The French Revolution and its aftermath has filled the town with hundreds of French \u00e9migr\u00e9s who bring with them money and foreign ways. The salt furnaces provide wealth and jobs but they destroy those who work in them. Although the town is picturesque, the forces maintaining it are dangerous and uncontrollable. The novel begins with the disappointing information that the future happiness and reconciliation promised in The Rationalist failed to materialise. Silas Grange, the Scottish doctor who would prefer to live and die by David Hume, has suffered a mental and physical collapse. Mrs Celia Quill, the enigmatic stranger who seemed poised to unlock the constraints around his rational heart, has departed suddenly and without trace. Dr Hargood, Grange's best friend and mentor, carries inside him the burden of guilt and knowledge. What makes The Marriage of Souls such a wonderful book is Collins's intricate reconstruction of the late eighteenth-century world. Simplicity and philosophy are the hallmarks of eighteenth-century art and architecture. The classically pure lines look deceptively simple and unburdened by heavy symbolism or imagery. But the unique accessibility of the eighteenth-century mind belies a complex and sophisticated philosophical framework. This is the essence of The Marriage of Souls. The irony is that there are few eighteenth-century novels which succeed in capturing the eighteenth century as well as some twentieth-century writers can do today. The average eighteenth-century novel is, of course, of its time, but that is not the same thing as being able to capture the time.

After all, 11 from the original party of 17 chosen for the South African tour have arrived via this route. The exceptions are Stewart and Tufnell, who are too old for A tours (the first was in 1989-90); Mullally and Tudor, who somehow skipped them, although Tudor will doubtless have to go back to finishing school after his anonymous senior tour this winter; and Adams and Hamilton, presumably because they were never thought to be good enough. </p> <p>Read the reports and the A team seems to be the ideal nursery for English cricketers. England are uniquely successful at this level. They have not lost a first-class match since the one that began on 1 January 1994 in Durban. Then Natal, led by Malcolm Marshall and including little gems like Shaun Pollock and Lance Klusener, defeated them by an innings. (This is a slightly bogus statistic since the A side lost a four-day game against New South Wales B in 1996, but it was deemed by the Australian Cricket Board not to be a first-class fixture.) </p> <p>So, since 1994 the England A team have become the modern invincibles and the provocateurs of some purple prose. For example, the Benson and Hedges Cricket Year book reports that the side that toured Zimbabwe and South Africa last winter had 'an unquenchable will to win; a team spirit whereby the whole is truly more than the sum of the parts... the players showed all the qualities for which the full Test team has striven for so long while finding them so elusive'. David Graveney must have taken note. From that A side, Vaughan, Flintoff, Maddy, Read, Swann and Solanki currently find themselves in South Africa with the senior team. </p> <p>It was just the same in Australia in 1996-97. 'This team', we read in Wisden , 'did not wilt at the first whiff of cordite. Instead adversity gelled them into a spirited fighting unit.' On that tour the stars, soon to be promoted, were Mark Butcher and Dean Headley. Two years earlier, after an expedition to India, we could boast of 'a clutch of young players bursting with talent, character and naked ambition' ( Wisden ). These included Mark Ramprakash, Dominic Cork and Ian Salisbury. The team that lost in Durban six years ago, nonetheless, had an 'unreservedly successful tour'. All except two went on to play Test cricket (the unfortunates were Mal Loye and Adrian Dale), though ominously Darren Gough is the only one who still does. </p> <p>Clearly we have to be wary of this success story. The concept of A tours and A teams is a good one, but we obviously take them a little more seriously than some of our international counterparts. One example: in 1996-97, the A team defeated South Australia in Adelaide in a closely fought match by 12 runs. However, that victory was tarnished slightly by the fact that Darren Lehmann, the opposition's best batsman, was absent during South Australia's second innings , 'having been called away to undertake promotional work for the Australian Cricket Board'. </p> <p>Without wishing to denigrate any of the performances of successive A tourists, it seems clear that these expeditions are relatively cosy affairs compared to the senior tours. By and large, the matches are watched by three men and a dog unless you happen to be in one of the 'lesser' countries like Bangladesh. The A tours attract a small, friendly press corps - unlike the senior tour - who are eager to be supportive and to get to know potential stars of the future. And sometimes the opposition are not too taxing; indeed it would probably be more beneficial if the A team lost more frequently. (The gurus keep telling us that we learn more from defeat than victory.) </p> <p>The plateau created by the professional status of the game in England means that there are probably more reasonably good cricketers in this country than in any other. If a World Third XI competition were instigated, there's a fair chance that England would win it (OK you Aussies, start writing). Part of the problem is that the A tours do not syphon out the moderate also-rans ruthlessly enough. Selection for an A tour leaves a player with a better than 50 per cent chance of a senior cap, yet far too many of these players finish their international careers with no more than three or four caps to their name. They are soon found wanting at Test level and discarded. We need to be able to discover those limitations when they are in the A side. </p> <p>So how can we improve our nursery? It would help us if the status of these tours was enhanced, especially in Australia . On two A tours there, England have yet to be granted a fixture against an Australian A side. But to improve the chances of other countries improving the A team schedules, England may be required to make some sacrifices of their own, which brings us back to familiar territory: the county club versus country conflict. </p> <p>If the A team really are the means to advance the progress of our potential Test cricketers, then they should have a range of fixtures in the English summer as well. In the past they have had a meaningless match at the beginning of April against the County Champions, in which every player is clad in half a dozen sweaters. </p> <p>It would, however, be possible for an A team fixture against the tourists to become the 'sixth' Test match - or the 'third' in the case of Zimbabwe this summer. The counties are constantly criticised for putting out sub-standard XIs against the tourists, why not field A teams three or four times a season against the tourists and visiting A sides instead? This would only be worthwhile if every county cricketer was available for selection for these games, not just those who have a break in their county schedule. </p> <p>The counties, I can assure you, would detest this suggestion. Already they are losing their Test players for unprecedentedly large chunks of the season; they would not be happy to sacrifice their A team players as well.

      "bodyText": "Arise Graeme Hick, England captain. Indeed, 'tis true - the game's original comeback kid will lead the men from Mud Island against an invitation XI at St George's Park today. The three-day match is an assignment that teams who have lost a Test series early could do without. Except that England have rested their dead men walking from the Kingsmead stalemate and the Newlands checkmate. So Hick, himself a new addition to this tour, will captain a side who will carry only physical baggage into the dressing room. Anything else would have been cruel and inhuman punishment of an England touring party that seems to be running on empty with a Test match, at least six one-day internationals and another tour match - a sure to be dreary affair against minnows North West under perhaps the only lights in the permanently Prozac-stricken Afrikaner town of Potchefstroom - still to be played. Evidence of England's flagging spirit was there for all to see in the hotel bar hours after what became the final day at Newlands. More than just the disappointment of defeat, their faces hung with despair at another tour, another Test series, gone sour. By the look of some of them, it could have been one series too many. Seldom, if indeed ever, has Phil Tufnell glared out of a pub - a pub for goodness sake, Tuffers - with such an obvious 'wish-I-was-somewhere-bloody-else' look about his steadily greening gills. Michael Atherton roamed the place like a moose with a migraine. Some of the South Africans among the bar's patrons were quick to sense the mood and, with all the gracelessness they could muster, they lapsed into a muffled refrain of, 'You're so shite it's unbelievable' - a vicious echo of the Barmy Army's 'We're so rich it's unbelievable'. Kepler Wessels, in his newspaper column, put it more articulately but no less harshly. Having praised the efforts of Michael Vaughan, Wessels wrote, 'There are just too many players in this team who are not up to the job. Chris Adams plays with so much bottom hand that his early dismissal against top quality bowlers is almost inevitable... One would feel more sorry for him if he didn't have so much to say.

South Africa are obviously the superior team, expected to win, but the capitulation at Newlands was a painful reversion to Old England, hapless and spineless; the sort of performance that must cheer the Zimbabweans, England's next Test opponents, who are eager to hand over the wooden spoon of international cricket. </p> <p>The familiar trigger reactions after another English Test walloping soon surfaced: there were the laments about a soft county game, the perils of the benefit system, poor pitches, staffs too big, hearts too small. All valid points. Then comes the demand to toss in the youngsters, any youngsters. That, too, is a perfectly reasonable reaction (indeed, my sports editor has just suggested this). Why not catapult Vikram Solanki, newly arrived in South Africa after a successful A tour, in to the team for the Fifth Test? Send for Chris Schofield; he bowls out of the back of the hand, doesn't he? What have you got to lose? </p> <p>Solanki and Schofield may be fine cricketers; they may both be future Test cricketers. Let's hope so. But - and I know you sensed a 'but' coming along - an important point about selection needs to be hammered out before handing out Test caps to 23-year-olds who have suddenly become the flavour of the month. </p> <p>The selection of a debutant is the start of a long process; it dictates selectorial strategy not for five days, but for a season. That initial assessment of the talent and temperament of potential debutants is critical, since its consequences linger for so long. Get it wrong and the whole process is tangled up for months to come. Once selected, those debutantes deserve time and patience. The wait has to be worthwhile. </p> <p>Over the past year or two too many of these selectorial punts have not worked. Often their failure can be put down to what we may call 'The David Steele Syndrome'. Twenty-five years ago Tony Greig plucked that craggy yet charismatic artisan out of county cricket to take on Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson. The gamble worked spectacularly. Steele, who went on to average 42 in his eight Test matches, was embraced by the public as affectionately as the Dad's Army characters he resembled. He was the BBC's Sports Personality of the Year (try to imagine a cricketer winning that trophy now). </p> <p>Ever since then selectors have sought to repeat that masterstroke - plucking out a county stalwart and tossing him to Test cricket - to no avail. Steele was the exception. In the Eighties they tried Chris Cowdrey and Tim Curtis, and moving into the Nineties there were Rob Bailey and Richard Blakey. In 1998 it was Steve James. Last summer they suddenly plumped for Aftab Habib, even though he had never been chosen for an A tour. </p> <p>Habib, 27, was undoubtedly talented, but even his own coach queried whether he had the toughness for Test cricket. Unfortunately for Habib the experiment lasted for only two Tests but the about-turn in selection policy when he was dropped caused a major Hick-inspired ruckus and the sudden abandonment of Gatting and Gooch as selectors. </p> <p>Then at the end of the 1999 English season the mandarins at Lord's demanded a change of personnel from the selectors. So they plucked out Chris Adams to start a Test career at the age of 29. No questions asked about his toughness; he was picked for his 'character'. But the sad fact is that you can possess the most positive and combative of characters and find it of limited value sitting in the pavilion having nicked another drive into the slip cordon. The Adams experiment had to last at least four Tests and may continue for the entire series. In all probability it has been a waste of time. Gavin Hamilton, another never selected for an A tour, was another trigger reaction based on 'character', though he was ditched after one disastrous Test. </p> <p>So far the selectors are in serious debit. Admittedly the process of selection is trickier than it was two decades ago. Then, if you wanted to assess the quality of a county batsman you could go to Southampton or Bristol or Nottingham and watch him bat against Malcolm Marshall or Courtney Walsh or Richard Hadlee and Clive Rice. If the batsman could handle them, then you knew he had a chance at Test level. The presence of so many quality overseas bowlers enhanced the selection process and the quality of our batsmen. </p> <p>However, the current selectors can claw back a little credibility in their choices of Michael Vaughan and Andrew Flintoff. By most international standards this pair has performed modestly in South Africa, but there is something there. Vaughan looks composed and has batted for a long time in this series; Flintoff hasn't, but he excites during the brief periods that he remains at the crease. Both should start in the Test team in May. These are our investments for the future, but we cannot afford to have many more novices in our Test side at the same time and realistically expect to win. </p> <p>The selection for the final Test of this series at Centurion Park becomes something of a mish-mash. Darren Maddy will presumably play so we have a chance to learn a little more about him. Hamilton may yet get a reprieve as a replacement for Flintoff who will be in plaster for the next month. Graeme Swann, who seems to have spent three months in South Africa to satisfy the ECB's September PR requirements ('Look, we have farsightedly included two 21-year olds' - Swann and Chris Read) would be understandably furious if Solanki leap-frogged him now. </p> <p>Of more interest and significance will be the make-up of the first Test side of next summer and something remarkable will have to happen at Centurion this week if Mark Butcher and Adams are in it. I have a weakness for picking the best players so have not written off Mark Ramprakash, average 40 in his last stint as an England player, though I like the idea of considering him as an opening batsman. Elevation in the batting order worked spectacularly for Gooch and Amiss, who both had nightmarish starts to their Test careers. There can be less pressure at number one than six. David Graveney should encourage him to open the batting for Middlesex in April, if their new captain, Justin Langer, permits. </p> <p>Nor would I blackball Gra ham Thorpe because he chose not to tour. By opting out this winter, Thorpe trod the same path as some stalwart heavyweights of the past - Botham, Gooch and Boycott, for example. He has to earn his return though in the current climate that should not be too difficult. Far better for Thorpe to have made his decision in August last year than to have moped around South Africa this winter, wishing he was somewhere else. </p> <p>These two are potential replacements for Butcher and Adams; their experience should allow Vaughan and Flintoff some freedom to continue their development as Test cricketers. Then the nucleus of seamers could be augmented by Tufnell or Swann or Schofield or even, as a batting all-rounder, Solanki - but only after detailed research and debate, not as a desperate, populist reaction to public opinion and the latest cock-up.</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The recent controversy about the European Union's proposed withholding tax on interest payments is only one in a growing number of problems of international tax harmonisation, not only in Europe, but across the globe. </p> <p>The withholding tax debate may be somewhat obscure, but most people are aware of at least one instance where the lack of tax harmonisation is anomalous - when they load up their cars with wine as they come back from their holidays in France. In a common market, sales taxes in neighbouring states cannot in the end differ too markedly without perpetuating such distortions. But it is easy to understand the British government's reluctance to reduce its dependence on such a major and long-standing source of revenue as our high rates of tax on alcohol. </p> <p>What is more difficult to understand is the Government's proposed introduction of swingeing energy taxes on British industries, such as steel, at potentially much higher levels than their overseas or continental competitors. With CO\u00b2 emissions a global issue, it seems particularly inappropriate to attempt to tackle it in this uncoordinated fashion. </p> <p>Such unilateral action is liable to divert demand from British companies to other steel producers, which in some cases will be more serious sources of pollution. </p> <p>The Government has already begun to realise the danger of this approach by reducing its original proposed rates of taxation and increasing the rebates offered: if the negotiated energy targets are met, companies will get a rebate of 80 per cent - an interesting case of taxation by negotiation! But the clear moral is that such taxes make sense only if levied on a uniform regional or global basis. </p> <p>It seems strange that a Labour government should have given so little prior thought to the dangers of imposing fresh taxation on industries such as steel, already struggling with low prices and a strong pound, but prove so sensitive to the possible effects on London Eurobond dealers of clamping down on tax evasion by investors in these securities. There is obviously some validity in the Government's argument that imposing a withholding tax, or enforcing an exchange of information, might lead the market to relocate outside the EU; but the moral is that this is a case for tax harmonisation on a global basis, not that the UK government should defend the use of the London market as a respectable tax haven. </p> <p>Regional tax harmonisation may be sufficient for goods and services with appreciable transport costs, but when it comes to financial transactions, which may be carried out virtually anywhere in the world, harmonisation on a global basis will become increasingly necessary. </p> <p>However narrow or broad the scope of such arrangements, we shall have to face up not only to the initial problems of negotiating the original agreements with a common tax rate and rules of the game, but also the fact that subsequent changes will depend on intergovernmental agreement. </p> <p>This will require new institutional arrangements and new habits of thought. Some forms of 'national' taxation will take on an increasingly international dimension. So far we have been assuming that all taxes, even if imposed by international agreement, are raised for national purposes; but we are entering an era in which international taxes are needed for international purposes, such as development assistance, combating environmental pollution and peacekeeping. </p> <p>The most long-standing candidate in this field is the so-called Tobin Tax, Professor James Tobin's 1972 proposal to levy a low rate of tax, say 0.1 per cent, on all foreign exchange transactions. This was originally conceived as a means of damping down speculative activity in currency markets, something even more desirable today than it was then. Recently it has come to the fore as a possible revenue raiser for international purposes, and is actively backed by organisations such as Oxfam. </p> <p>Such a tax would need to cover all the main currency markets - and to give governments the incentive to participate they could keep part of the proceeds for national purposes.

      "bodyText": "The recent controversy about the European Union's proposed withholding tax on interest payments is only one in a growing number of problems of international tax harmonisation, not only in Europe, but across the globe. The withholding tax debate may be somewhat obscure, but most people are aware of at least one instance where the lack of tax harmonisation is anomalous - when they load up their cars with wine as they come back from their holidays in France. In a common market, sales taxes in neighbouring states cannot in the end differ too markedly without perpetuating such distortions. But it is easy to understand the British government's reluctance to reduce its dependence on such a major and long-standing source of revenue as our high rates of tax on alcohol. What is more difficult to understand is the Government's proposed introduction of swingeing energy taxes on British industries, such as steel, at potentially much higher levels than their overseas or continental competitors. With CO\u00b2 emissions a global issue, it seems particularly inappropriate to attempt to tackle it in this uncoordinated fashion. Such unilateral action is liable to divert demand from British companies to other steel producers, which in some cases will be more serious sources of pollution. The Government has already begun to realise the danger of this approach by reducing its original proposed rates of taxation and increasing the rebates offered: if the negotiated energy targets are met, companies will get a rebate of 80 per cent - an interesting case of taxation by negotiation! But the clear moral is that such taxes make sense only if levied on a uniform regional or global basis. It seems strange that a Labour government should have given so little prior thought to the dangers of imposing fresh taxation on industries such as steel, already struggling with low prices and a strong pound, but prove so sensitive to the possible effects on London Eurobond dealers of clamping down on tax evasion by investors in these securities. There is obviously some validity in the Government's argument that imposing a withholding tax, or enforcing an exchange of information, might lead the market to relocate outside the EU; but the moral is that this is a case for tax harmonisation on a global basis, not that the UK government should defend the use of the London market as a respectable tax haven. Regional tax harmonisation may be sufficient for goods and services with appreciable transport costs, but when it comes to financial transactions, which may be carried out virtually anywhere in the world, harmonisation on a global basis will become increasingly necessary. However narrow or broad the scope of such arrangements, we shall have to face up not only to the initial problems of negotiating the original agreements with a common tax rate and rules of the game, but also the fact that subsequent changes will depend on intergovernmental agreement. This will require new institutional arrangements and new habits of thought. Some forms of 'national' taxation will take on an increasingly international dimension. So far we have been assuming that all taxes, even if imposed by international agreement, are raised for national purposes; but we are entering an era in which international taxes are needed for international purposes, such as development assistance, combating environmental pollution and peacekeeping. The most long-standing candidate in this field is the so-called Tobin Tax, Professor James Tobin's 1972 proposal to levy a low rate of tax, say 0.1 per cent, on all foreign exchange transactions. This was originally conceived as a means of damping down speculative activity in currency markets, something even more desirable today than it was then. Recently it has come to the fore as a possible revenue raiser for international purposes, and is actively backed by organisations such as Oxfam. Such a tax would need to cover all the main currency markets - and to give governments the incentive to participate they could keep part of the proceeds for national purposes. This would be particularly attractive to the UK, which covers a third of all such transactions. Hitherto, sales of goods and services have been regarded as fair game for finance ministers, but sales of financial instruments have been left virtually untouched - in the cause of maximising liquidity. Recent financial crises have provided clear evidence, however, that there can be too much liquidity and thus speculative activity. Foreign exchange transactions may not be the only field where low taxes may be a useful in avoiding excessive speculation. Just as the finance ministers (including Chancellor Gordon Brown), have become enthusiastic about 'green' taxes as a politically correct source of revenue, so other forms of taxation that would dampen down price fluctuations in financial markets may come into their own in the next decade. \u0095 John Grieve Smith is a fellow of Robinson College, Cambridge.",

      "body": "<p>In case you haven't heard yet, the twenty-first century is female. Women are set to scale the highest peaks of the world of work; their skills are the ones needed in the new, creative economy; they are calling the shots (and calling it quits) in relationships. Exit breadwinning man. Enter superwoman. </p> <p>But amid the celebrations over the economic and social emancipation of women - somewhat overstated in any case - are siren voices foretelling the destruction of family and community in the wake of woman's onward march. The counter-revolutionary cry of 'The children will suffer!' was thankfully exploded by decent social research. In place of the latch-key kid, a new victim has emerged: the depressed dad. </p> <p>New research suggests partners of high-flying women are suffering depression and anxiety, absorbing the woes of their spouse or girlfriend. Friday night conversations with each partner vying for the status of most stressed at work looks to be taking a higher toll on the male than female. </p> <p>Evelyn Webster, a publishing director at 30, is in the vanguard of the gender revolution in the workplace. 'My partner and I live apart, after living together for a while,' she says. 'People think something has gone wrong but actually it is much better. If you are both working really hard, and really busy, you go to your shared home and just talk about work. But if one of you is going to the other's home, you put a different head on.' </p> <p>Webster's is a radical survival tactic for the new world, in which men and women are struggling to cope with the competing demands of their own jobs, domestic work, child care, while maintaining their relationship. </p> <p>Sophie Crossfield of Hertfordshire University is co-author of the work on stress 'transmission' in dual career couples and says the findings may reflect the birth pangs of the new equality at work. 'It could be that men have always looked to women for emotional support that may not be available in the same capacity when they have as demanding jobs as their partners,' she says. </p> <p>Evidence that the mental health of men in dual-income households is suffering may reflect shifting masculine and feminine identities. Men have traditionally defined themselves in terms of their work; while women's family status has been a key defining characteristic for them. Women thankfully have more choices now - but men's role, their unique contribution to the family and wider society, becomes unclear once the mantle of breadwinner is lost. </p> <p>They have a female boss at work and often - because women still undertake the bulk of child care and domestic responsibility - a female boss at home. Cue the Loaded generation, desperately trying to cling to a hard-drinking, boorish male identity. </p> <p>It is easy to overstate the feminisation of the world of work. There are few breaks in the grey monochrome suits of most boardrooms. Women's pay is still 20 per cent lower than men's, and there is little sign of the gap narrowing. But there are more women than men reading law and medicine; childless female graduates outperform their male counterparts; women make up 48 per cent of first-level management in the Civil Service, compared with 29 per cent in 1984; they account for 18 per cent of managers, double the proportion just eight years ago. Et cetera. </p> <p>A spokeswoman for the Government's Women's Unit said the aim was to reduce the pay gap to zero. But public policy is confused. On the one hand, the Government seems to want women to be equal competitors in the workplace. On the other, it wants them to carry the bulk of the home burden (or else we might have seen the introduction of paid paternity leave). </p> <p>On Monday, a minister will call for an end to the gender gap in the world of paid work; on Tuesday, a minister will say that women have the cen tral role in families and communities. A woman is actively encouraged, to be at the top of a profession - so long as she remembers to buy the nappies, pick up the kids, run the PTA, organise breakfast. Forget men's troubles for a moment: what are we asking of women here? </p> <p>'The rhetoric of the Government reinforces the view that child care is a women's issue,' says Helen Wilkinson, a writer on gender and employment issues. 'It is a difficult balance, because at the moment it is true that women do the bulk of child care, but the perceptions of gender roles do need to change.' </p> <p>In the United States, where the female assault on the workplace is a few years older, it is still difficult for women to be a mother and a top executive: while 95 per cent of senior male managers are married, just 5 per cent of women are. </p> <p>We are at a crossroads. It is an inescapable fact - if one few will utter - that women will not be able to compete on an equal footing in the workplace as long as they are expected to bear an unequal share of the load at home. </p> <p>Some are calling for a halt in the revolution, a restatement of the essential differences. Trevor Berry, chairman of Families Need Fathers, which campaigns on behalf of men with children, says: 'The policy now seems to be to make the roles of men and women interchangeable. In fact, mothers often suffer pangs of guilt on returning to work. If that makes me old fashioned, I'm sorry. </p> <p>'Men like a competitive situation, and have traditionally been the main breadwinner. Men can feel a certain sense of inferiority if they are playing second fiddle to their partner - it is just the way they are. You can't change that.' </p> <p>Commentators like Berry, and Melanie Phillips, author of the Sex Change State , reckon the limits of our ability to change roles has been reached, and that we need to accept that men will always do more breadwinning, women more caring. </p> <p>Others argue that the only thing for it is to reduce the pay gap, finally remove the glass ceiling, and help men come to terms with the new reality. Joanna Foster, chair of the National Work-Life Forum, says that new skills will have to be acquired by men, as well as a richer appreciation of their role as fathers and partners. 'Men haven't had to deal with this before,' she says of the dual-earner study. 'New sets of interpersonal skills, emotional intelligence, will be needed.' </p> <p>If real equality is to be reached, men's role in the home will have to increase, to balance the loss of the monopoly at work and allow women to compete fairly. This is already beginning to happen: over the past 30 years, men have increased the time they spend on child care fourfold - although women still spend twice as much time on looking after children. </p> <p>Young women are acutely aware that taking time out to have children can dent their career prospects, and are choosing to delay having a family or decide against children altogether. 'I am deferring homely decisions until later,' says Webster. 'At the moment it is all about work. And my perception is that women do work much harder than men.' </p> <p>Once men start writing letters to Loaded asking how to combine their career with being a good husband, once men in playgrounds on weekdays don't feel like aliens, we'll know the new world has truly arrived. For the moment, women are able - at some cost - to buy the help they need to lead two lives. </p> <p>Webster says: 'I have two sisters with children and successful careers, and they manage to live two lives by employing people to help them, not because their partners are any different.' </p> <p>In the shorter term, Crossfield says there are two areas where change is required. First, there is a pressing need to challenge the long hours culture. 'Doing relaxation exercises while listening to dolphin music may reduce stress in the short term,' she says, 'but wouldn't it be great if we could focus interventions on actually preventing workers getting stressed in the first place?' </p> <p>Second, women and particularly men will have to think more about how they relate to their partner. Only three out of 80 participants in the survey said their discussions with partners dealt with the 'the good stuff' at work. </p> <p>'It does tend to paint a rather depressing picture of couples coming home and talking about the down side of work, and perhaps not sharing the more positive aspects of their day,' she says. 'Perhaps we just need to find a healthier balance, rather than using our partner as an emotional dumping ground.' </p> <p>Webster takes a harder-headed view, arguing that it is up to women to reconfigure their lives, and earn enough to make their own choices. 'It is entirely unfair that they have to manage two lives in a way that men do not,' she says. 'But I can't see it changing, not for a long time anyway.' </p> <p><strong>The path to equality</strong> <br></p> <p><strong> Steps forward</strong> </p> <p> \u0095 Women now earn 80 per cent of average male salaries, up from 55 per cent in 1970 </p> <p> \u0095 The number of women MPs is 121, up from 20 in the early 1980s </p> <p> \u0095 18 per cent of managers are women, a tenfold increase since 1974 </p> <p> \u0095 New freedoms: 75 per cent of 16- to 19-year-old women had at least one sexual partner last year, compared with 50 per cent of men the same age </p> <p> \u0095 Half of all parents say childcare is shared equally </p> <p> <strong> Steps backward</strong> </p> <p> \u0095 Three-quarters of clerical and secretarial staff are women </p> <p>\u0095 23 per cent of women and 27 per cent of men agree that 'a husband's job is to earn the money; a wife's job is to look after the home and family' </p> <p>\u0095 In four couples out of five, the woman usually or always does the ironing </p> <p>\u0095 A third of women say they haven't got time to learn new skills because of family commitments, compared with 16 per cent of men </p> <p> \u0095 Only 56 per cent of women hold a driving license, compared to 81 per cent of men</p>",

It is an inescapable fact - if one few will utter - that women will not be able to compete on an equal footing in the workplace as long as they are expected to bear an unequal share of the load at home. Some are calling for a halt in the revolution, a restatement of the essential differences. Trevor Berry, chairman of Families Need Fathers, which campaigns on behalf of men with children, says: 'The policy now seems to be to make the roles of men and women interchangeable. In fact, mothers often suffer pangs of guilt on returning to work. If that makes me old fashioned, I'm sorry. 'Men like a competitive situation, and have traditionally been the main breadwinner. Men can feel a certain sense of inferiority if they are playing second fiddle to their partner - it is just the way they are. You can't change that.' Commentators like Berry, and Melanie Phillips, author of the Sex Change State , reckon the limits of our ability to change roles has been reached, and that we need to accept that men will always do more breadwinning, women more caring. Others argue that the only thing for it is to reduce the pay gap, finally remove the glass ceiling, and help men come to terms with the new reality. Joanna Foster, chair of the National Work-Life Forum, says that new skills will have to be acquired by men, as well as a richer appreciation of their role as fathers and partners. 'Men haven't had to deal with this before,' she says of the dual-earner study. 'New sets of interpersonal skills, emotional intelligence, will be needed.' If real equality is to be reached, men's role in the home will have to increase, to balance the loss of the monopoly at work and allow women to compete fairly. This is already beginning to happen: over the past 30 years, men have increased the time they spend on child care fourfold - although women still spend twice as much time on looking after children. Young women are acutely aware that taking time out to have children can dent their career prospects, and are choosing to delay having a family or decide against children altogether. 'I am deferring homely decisions until later,' says Webster. 'At the moment it is all about work. And my perception is that women do work much harder than men.' Once men start writing letters to Loaded asking how to combine their career with being a good husband, once men in playgrounds on weekdays don't feel like aliens, we'll know the new world has truly arrived. For the moment, women are able - at some cost - to buy the help they need to lead two lives. Webster says: 'I have two sisters with children and successful careers, and they manage to live two lives by employing people to help them, not because their partners are any different.' In the shorter term, Crossfield says there are two areas where change is required. First, there is a pressing need to challenge the long hours culture. 'Doing relaxation exercises while listening to dolphin music may reduce stress in the short term,' she says, 'but wouldn't it be great if we could focus interventions on actually preventing workers getting stressed in the first place?' Second, women and particularly men will have to think more about how they relate to their partner. Only three out of 80 participants in the survey said their discussions with partners dealt with the 'the good stuff' at work. 'It does tend to paint a rather depressing picture of couples coming home and talking about the down side of work, and perhaps not sharing the more positive aspects of their day,' she says. 'Perhaps we just need to find a healthier balance, rather than using our partner as an emotional dumping ground.' Webster takes a harder-headed view, arguing that it is up to women to reconfigure their lives, and earn enough to make their own choices. 'It is entirely unfair that they have to manage two lives in a way that men do not,' she says. 'But I can't see it changing, not for a long time anyway.' The path to equality Steps forward \u0095 Women now earn 80 per cent of average male salaries, up from 55 per cent in 1970 \u0095 The number of women MPs is 121, up from 20 in the early 1980s \u0095 18 per cent of managers are women, a tenfold increase since 1974 \u0095 New freedoms: 75 per cent of 16- to 19-year-old women had at least one sexual partner last year, compared with 50 per cent of men the same age \u0095 Half of all parents say childcare is shared equally Steps backward \u0095 Three-quarters of clerical and secretarial staff are women \u0095 23 per cent of women and 27 per cent of men agree that 'a husband's job is to earn the money; a wife's job is to look after the home and family' \u0095 In four couples out of five, the woman usually or always does the ironing \u0095 A third of women say they haven't got time to learn new skills because of family commitments, compared with 16 per cent of men \u0095 Only 56 per cent of women hold a driving license, compared to 81 per cent of men",

      "body": "<p>He speaks in highly polished sermons delivered with the rhythmic cadences of a gospel preacher. Although he has sight in only one eye, his gaze is piercing. And while his mantelpiece displays a belt attesting to his honorary title of world middleweight boxing champion, the fighter known as 'Hurricane' because of his punishing left hook now finds the sport barbaric. His new passion: gardening. </p> <p>Despite 19 years in prison for a triple murder he did not commit, Rubin Carter considers himself blessed. 'I would not change one single thing in my life,' he says in the basement of his Toronto house. 'Everything that went before has made me what I am today. And today I am deeply and seriously in love with myself. I don't want to be anyone but who I am. I am perfect.' </p> <p>The American lets out a loud laugh meant to demonstrate his new-found lust for life. But it becomes clear that the laughter is also a salve for deep emotional wounds that have estranged him from much of his family, his country and even those who worked hardest for his release. </p> <p>Still, these are heady days for Carter, 63. His story, chronicled early on in a Bob Dylan ballad, is now movingly portrayed by actor Denzel Washington in the film The Hurricane, which opened last week in Washington to acclaim and a buzz of Oscar expectations. Carter has already been to a special screening for President Bill Clinton at the White House, and this month there will be another at the United Nations to celebrate Human Rights Day. </p> <p>Then, too, there's Hurricane:The Miraculous Journey of Rubin Carter, the new authorised biography out this month by journalist James S. Hirsch, along with a reissue of Lazarus and the Hurricane, an earlier chronicle of Carter's fall and rise by Canadian friends Terry Swinton and Sam Chaiton. </p> <p>Yet Carter is intent on his new mission: gaining freedom for others who may have been unjustly imprisoned. His Association in Defence of the Wrongly Convicted, run from his house, has already helped to spring a number of high-profile prisoners from Canadian jails with the use of volunteer lawyers, private detectives and new DNA evidence. </p> <p>'Many innocent people are locked up, and somebody ought to be held accountable,' he says. </p> <p>In the case of the State of New Jersey versus Rubin Carter, it's fair to say there has been no accountability. Most of the prosecutors have gone on to become judges, and the judges have gone on to become appellate judges. The cop who headed the investigation was promoted. Lee Sarokin, the federal judge who finally overturned Carter's conviction, was virtually hounded into retirement by Republicans who tagged him 'Let 'em go' Lee. </p> <p>Now, however, Hollywood aims to even the score with an inspiring morality play that demonises the New Jersey cops and prosecutors and glorifies Carter's saintly resolve, and tells of a small band of idealistic Canadians who won Carter's freedom. </p> <p>The story begins in Paterson, New Jersey, on 16 June, 1966. Two black men entered the Lafayette Grill and shot dead the owner and two patrons. Within hours, police pulled over a white Cadillac driven by John Artis, 19, with Carter, the car's owner, in the front seat. </p> <p>Carter was well known to the Paterson force. As a child, he had been sent to reform school for throwing a bottle at a man's head; as an adult, he had served several prison terms for beatings and handbag snatches. As a boxer he picked up the black nationalist rhetoric of the time, and talked of the need for blacks to use guns to protect themselves from bigoted white cops and judges. </p> <p>The initial evidence did not point to Carter and Artis. Various witnesses declined to identify them. Their own stories - that Carter was merely giving Artis a lift home before heading to a meeting with his sparring partner - were supported by lie-detector tests. The guns were never found. </p> <p>But several months later the police claimed to have turned up two petty thieves who had been staking out a nearby building and saw Carter and Artis flee the bar. Although their testimony had won them immunity from prosecution for burglary, it was enough for an all-white jury to convict Carter and Artis of the killings. Both received life sentences. </p> <p>Artis became a model prisoner and won parole in 15 years, but Carter proudly and stubbornly refused to wear prison clothes, eat prison food or take a prison job, winning himself long and repeated stays in solitary confinement. He slept during the day, and at night read law books to help with his appeal, and tapped out an eloquent, angry biography, The Sixteenth Round. He insisted that guards and other inmates call him Mr Carter and, out of some mixture of respect and fear, they did. </p> <p>In the racially charged, protest-driven politics of the early Seventies, Carter became a folk hero for the radical chic. His cause was taken up by the likes of Burt Reynolds, Roberta Flack, Stevie Wonder, Ed Koch, Jesse Jackson, Norman Mailer, Jimmy Breslin, Bill Bradley, Candice Bergen and Dylan. There was a benefit concert at Madison Square Garden, marches and TV interviews. </p> <p>Finally, after Alfred Bello, one of the two thieves, recanted his story to the New York Times, Carter and Artis were granted a new trial in 1976. Muhammad Ali showed up to post bail. But by the time the second trial came, the police had pressurised Bello into recanting his recantation. Prosecutors, desperate to provide a motive for the killing, played the race card, asserting without much proof that the grill murders were revenge for the killing of a black bar owner six hours earlier. With Carter's history of inflammatory racial rhetoric, the jury was open to this theory. He and Artis were convicted a second time. </p> <p>That broke Carter's resolve. Back in his cell, he cut off all communication with his wife and children from his first marriage, his supporters and his lawyers. He threw away his law books and began reading philosophy. His diet was a can of soup every three days. Botched prison surgery cost him his sight in one eye. </p> <p>But one day in 1980 Carter decided to open one of the many letters he usually let pile up unanswered. It was from a 17-year-old black teenager, Lesra Martin, in Toronto. Martin had picked up The Sixteenth Round at a library book sale, and was so inspired by it that he wanted to thank Carter. </p> <p>Martin had grown up poor and, until then, illiterate. That summer he'd been adopted, in effect, by a group of University of Toronto graduates impressed by his wit and intelligence. He moved into the Canadians' group house in an upmarket Toronto neighbourhood and had daily tutoring. </p> <p>The Sixteenth Round was the first book he had ever read, and his letter to Carter the first he had ever written. Carter's response led to visits from Martin and four other commune members: Gus Sinclair, a Vietnam protester who gave money to US draft dodgers; Lisa Peters, a tough woman who ran away from home as a teenager and grew up on the streets; Terry Swinton, whose father was president of Encyclopaedia Britannica International; and Sam Chaiton, whose parents survived a Nazi concentration camp. </p> <p>Carter's plight appealed to their left-wing politics and determination to stamp out racism and injustice. Their interest in Carter rekindled in him not only the will to live, but the determination to get out of prison. By 1983 Peters, Chaiton and Swinton moved to an apartment 20 minutes from the prison to work full time on Carter's appeals. Martin, now enrolled at the University of Toronto, often flew down at the weekends. </p> <p>Judge Sarokin's final decision, on 7 November 1985, confirmed the value of new evidence the Canadians had dug up. He ruled that the convictions were 'predicated upon an appeal to racism rather than reason, concealment rather than disclosure'. Threats to witnesses and concealment of evidence by the police, and the prosecution's appeals to racism and violations of the Constitution, were 'as heinous as the crimes for which these petitioners were tried and convicted'. </p> <p>The Hollywood film ends with Carter drinking in sunshine and vindication on the court steps, but the reality was more complicated. Carter had to wrestle with the demons he had taken to prison and those he accumulated during his 19 years behind bars. He joined the Canadians' communal home, confronted his alcoholism, nurtured by prison moonshine. A platonic jail love affair with Peters quickly developed into something else. But in time Carter came to view the house - with its strict ban on alcohol and cigarettes, its uncompromising communalism and its insularity - as a new prison and himself as a 'trophy horse'. </p> <p>The relationship with the strong-willed Peters, always tempestuous, turned more so after they decided to marry. Carter stormed out of the house for the last time in 1994, showing up at Lesra Martin's Toronto flat. Even that arrangement broke down after Martin decided to resume legal studies in Halifax, Nova Scotia. It is a measure of Carter's estrangement from the Canadians that when the movie opened in Toronto they sat three rows apart and never exchanged a word. </p> <p>The cocky, boastful Rubin Carter of his middleweight days can still be seen a little, but he spars now with words instead of his fists. Still the dandy, he proudly shows off his updated wardrobe. His white Cadillac has been changed for a Mercedes. </p> <p>He refuses to set foot in New Jersey again, and is seeking Canadian citizenship.'The US authorities don't need a reason to do what they do to black people. They just need an opportunity - and I don't want to give them another one.' </p> <p>Carter has an American girlfriend in her twenties, and has re-established relations with Lesra Martin, who ironically is now a prosecutor in British Columbia. </p> <p>Martin says: 'I am in a unique position to make sure that wrongful convictions don't happen.As Rubin will tell you, it's easier to stop one before it happens than overturn it afterwards.' </p> <p> \u00a9Washington Post </p> <p><strong>How 'Hurricane' became a Hollywood legend</strong></p> <p>Here comes the story of the Hurricane, </p> <p>The man the authorities came to blame </p> <p>For somethin' that he never done. </p> <p>Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been </p> <p>The champion of the world... </p> <p>All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance, </p> <p>The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance. </p> <p>The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums; </p> <p>To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum </p> <p>And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger. </p> <p>No one doubted that he pulled the trigger. </p> <p>And though they could not produce the gun, </p> <p>The DA said he was the one who did the deed </p> <p>And the all-white jury agreed. </p> <p><strong> Lyrics from Bob Dylan's 'Hurricane', 1975</strong></p>",

No one doubted that he pulled the trigger. And though they could not produce the gun, The DA said he was the one who did the deed And the all-white jury agreed.
