Now people do not seem to be shouting quite so loudly about them. </p> <p>Abbey National, Britain's second-largest mortgage lender, says most bank and building societies are testing and trailing them, although a spokesman adds: \"I don't think anyone is selling them in great volumes.\" But it has included a tracker element in its new flexible mortgage. </p> <p>The simple reason tracker loans are not such hot news is that interest rates have been rising and mortgages that promise to pass on the full amount of any increase are not flavour of the month.

      "bodyText": "Tracker funds have been one of the investment success stories of the past decade, and now the concept has been extended to home loans - but instead of shadowing a stock market index such as the FTSE-100, tracker mortgages follow the ups and downs of the Bank of England base rate. With a tracker loan, the rate you pay is set a fixed amount above the base rate, which is currently 6%. This margin is typically 0.75%-1.5% above the base rate, though it can be as high 2%. When the base rate goes up or down, so does what you pay. Tracker mortgages burst on to the scene less than two years ago, and last summer they seemed to be everywhere. Now people do not seem to be shouting quite so loudly about them. Abbey National, Britain's second-largest mortgage lender, says most bank and building societies are testing and trailing them, although a spokesman adds: \"I don't think anyone is selling them in great volumes.\" But it has included a tracker element in its new flexible mortgage. The simple reason tracker loans are not such hot news is that interest rates have been rising and mortgages that promise to pass on the full amount of any increase are not flavour of the month. The clamour for trackers comes when rates are falling. But some experts reckon that the time could soon be very right indeed for trackers. While the forecast is for one or two more interest rate rises this year, economists still predict that in the longer term they are likely to fall sharply. As soon as we hit the start of the downwards cycle, trackers will catch on again. When rates do start to fall, we are likely to see a rerun of last year's debate about lenders not passing on rate cuts, according to Siobhan Hotten at mortgage brokers John Charcol. Many readers will recall that a number of lenders denied their borrowers the full benefit of interest rate cuts in April and June 1999. If this happens again, it will heighten tracker appeal because you cannot be diddled out of your rate cut. For this reason, trackers have won the government's seal of approval. In drawing up new voluntary minimum Cat standards for mortgages, details of which were announced this week, ministers have said that to make the grade, variable rate mortgages must never be more than two percentage points above the base rate. \"Trackers are very much here to stay,\" says Ms Hotten. \"I wouldn't be surprised if we start to see more and more of these products come onto the market. People do like the clarity that they bring.\" But not all trackers work in the same way With some, the rate is guaranteed to stay a certain amount above the base rate for the life of the mortgage, while others only guarantee to track the base rate for a few years. But the industry has been unable to resist tinkering with what was originally a simple concept, and adding bits here and there. John Charcol is offering an exclusive tracker deal, funded by the Halifax, where you pay the bank base rate minus 0.26% for two years, giving a current payment rate of 5.74%, then for the next three years you pay base rate plus 0.95%. The deal is available to those who can pay a deposit of at least 10%, and there is no lender's fee and no redemption penalties. There are a number of deals around that combine a tracker with a cap. These have been designed to give people some protection from rising rates. This sort of loan may appeal to those people who reckon we will see further interest rate rises in the short term but then are likely to see them falling.",

      "body": "<p>Playing on fears of a probable rise in interest rates after next month's meeting of the Bank of England's monetary committee, mortgage lenders are launching tempting cut-price and fixed-rate home loans. </p> <p>The headache for housebuyers is that with a plethora of mortgage products on the market, finding the right deal is not easy. </p> <p>And lenders seem to have decided that confusing customers is their route to riches. Novice homebuyers are most vulnerable because they tend to approach the building society or bank branch where they run their savings account, but these may not have the best deal. </p> <p>Finding the best ways to balance the monthly repayments makes a big difference. Borrowers who pinch their household budget to meet their monthly payments should look for a fixed rate to avoid problems if interest rates go up.

      "bodyText": "Playing on fears of a probable rise in interest rates after next month's meeting of the Bank of England's monetary committee, mortgage lenders are launching tempting cut-price and fixed-rate home loans. The headache for housebuyers is that with a plethora of mortgage products on the market, finding the right deal is not easy. And lenders seem to have decided that confusing customers is their route to riches. Novice homebuyers are most vulnerable because they tend to approach the building society or bank branch where they run their savings account, but these may not have the best deal. Finding the best ways to balance the monthly repayments makes a big difference. Borrowers who pinch their household budget to meet their monthly payments should look for a fixed rate to avoid problems if interest rates go up. Current capped deals - which can disappear overnight - include a 6.25% cap from Newcastle building society until July 2002, a three-year deal from Woolwich at 7.29% and a five-year cap from Abbey National at 7.25%. But, as ever, vigilance pays as banks and building societies are constantly updating their range of fixed-rate mortgage packages. For existing homebuyers locked into fixed rates, remortgaging at a lower rate can be worthwhile, as each percentage point drop in the mortgage rate cuts around \u00a363 a month on a \u00a3100,000 loan. To judge whether the time is right to opt for a fixed rate, first look at the movement of interest rates. Economic soothsayers expect the Bank of England to raise rates at least once before banks' base rates gradually settle down to converge with lower levels in the EU. Many lenders now also offer special capped rate home loans under which borrowers benefit from falling rates but avoid any further rises in prevailing mortgage rates over prearranged lengths of time. But if you are considering opting for a fixed-rate loan there are a few drawbacks to bear in mind when going for a fix or a cap.

I live in a maisonette, part of a terraced south London house split into three flats, where the three owners share the freehold. </p> <p>I'm used to rip-off London prices but was shocked to receive a \u00a31,075 bill from Eagle Star for my buildings insurance - and that did not include any contents cover or extended accidental damage. So I set about finding a better quote. </p> <p>Three hours later I had managed to knock the premium down to \u00a3683 - a saving of nearly \u00a3500 - but brokers rather than the much-advertised direct providers found the best deal. </p> <p>The first surprise was how many insurers refused to offer cover. Despite the fact that in London and other British cities houses split into flats is common enough, and shared freehold is taking over from leasehold, I was refused cover by AA Insurance Services, Axa Direct, Direct Line, Ecclesiastical Direct and Tesco Direct. I was fobbed off with explanations that they would sell you a policy only if you own the total freehold and are the sole owner occupier. </p> <p>I ran into similar problems trying to obtain quotes from internet-based services such as Screentrade.co.uk, which work well for straightforward cases but come unstuck with more complex cases. </p> <p>All the quotes I obtained (except from Cooperative Insurance Services) came from brokers, who contact a number of providers on your behalf to find a quote. The best quote was from Bradford &amp; Bingley, at \u00a3683, marginally ahead of the \u00a3721 obtained by a small independent bro ker, Playle Russell Special Risks via a Lloyd's syndicate. The worst was from Heath Insurance, which markets under different names such as Key Connect and Simply Direct, which wanted \u00a31,204.50. </p> <p>The first step in taking out a buildings policy is to calculate how much the sum insured should be. This is not the same as the market value of the house or your council tax band, but the cost of rebuilding it in the unlikely event of its complete destruction in a fire or a flood. </p> <p>Working out that figure is not easy. The rebuilding cost depends on the area you live in (London has the highest rebuilding costs, Northern Ireland the lowest), the type of property (detached houses are cheaper to rebuild than terraces) and the age of the house (pre-1920 houses are the most expensive). </p> <p>To help you in the calculation, the Association of British Insurers this week issued new ready reckoner tables. First you have to calculate the floor space of your house, including external walls, then look it up on the ABI grid. Sadly, but rather inevitably, my house, a pre-1920 London terrace, occupied the corner of the grid with the highest rebuild cost, at \u00a3998 per square metre. That compares to the cheapest rate, \u00a3549 per square metre for a semi built between 1946-1979 in region four, which includes the North East, West Midlands and Wales. </p> <p>It's a tedious task working out what your sum insured should be, but an essential one. For each \u00a31,000 of rebuilding cost, insurers will charge you an annual premium of between \u00a31.00 and \u00a33.50. </p> <p>Exactly what rate you get depends largely on your postcode, which reflects the risk of subsidence in your area. For example, Aberdeen, built on rock-solid granite, has the UK's lowest buildings insurance premiums. Soft and shrinking London clay results in hefty subsidence claims - and hefty buildings insurance premiums. </p> <p>A string of freak weather conditions in the late 80s and early 90s sent subsidence claims soaring and insurers have been trying to recoup the cost ever since, even though the number of claims levelled off in the mid-90s. </p> <p>Richard Playle of brokers Playle Russell says insurers are trying to push through increases this year of up to 25%, but says that he expects average premiums to rise by around 5% to 10%. </p> <p>But subsidence, although the chief factor, is only one of many that insurers will take into account before quoting you a premium. Others include: </p> <p><strong>Trees.</strong> Willows, in particular, can devastate a home's foundation, and should be no closer than 40m to your house. Insurers do not like trees any nearer than 10m to your walls. </p> <p><strong>Age.</strong> Some insurers won't offer buildings cover to under 30-year-olds, and premiums are always higher for under 25-year-olds. The thinking is that older people take more care in looking after their houses. </p> <p><strong>Occupation.</strong> Certain occupations such as workers in the entertainment and sports industries are likely to be referred for special underwriting. So is anyone with a recent criminal record, although motoring offences don't count. </p> <p><strong>Claims record. </strong>Any claim made in the last three years will result in higher premiums. Failure to disclose previous claims against other insurers will invalidate your policy. </p> <p><strong>Security.</strong> Neighbourhood Watch membership, window locks, triple mortice door locks, external security lights, smoke alarms and fire blankets all help to reduce your premium. Areas with high crime rates are always up-rated - rebuilding broken door frames and locks is one of the major causes of buildings insurance claims. </p> <p><strong>Accidental damage.</strong> Standard accidental damage to porcelain bathroom fittings, oven hobs, etc is included in a buildings policy. Carpets are not. Most will want an extra premium for extended accidental damage cover to include items such as putting your foot through the ceiling when you are in the loft. </p> <p><strong>Excess.</strong> On typical policies you have to pay the first \u00a350 of accidental damage and the first \u00a31,000 of any subsidence claim.

      "body": "<p>Over in Edinburgh, the British Art Show is raising vexing questions about art and life. Already the organisers have stated that the \"British\" bit of the title is anachronistic and will not be used again. Wandering round the eight galleries, it can indeed be hard to see what yokes together artists such as David Hockney and the young Glaswegian Jim Lambie. Place, history, culture, humour? Do any of these now hold up as nationally shared attributes? </p> <p>Maybe not for the giant British Art Show, but in Glasgow there is a group exhibition all about place and identity - rootedness wherever you might be from. </p> <p>If I Ruled the World is a kind of Summer Holiday of an exhibition, except that artists-turned-curators Ross Sinclair and Bryndis Snaebjornsdottir are driving the bus, instead of Cliff Richard. </p> <p>Commissioned by the CCA, a group of Glasgow-based artists travelled to Reykjavik last year for an exhibition at the Living Art Museum. They soaked up the Icelandic vibes and made work shaped and inspired by the country. Then they came home and made more work, influenced as much by their travels as by their homecoming. </p> <p>The result is a sharp, engaging show which provides us with more evidence of the flourishing Scottish art scene. There are names from the Becks Futures show at the ICA and BA5 - including Roddy Buchanan, Simon Starling and Martin Boyce - but there are others too. </p> <p>The others include Claire Barclay and Clara Ursitti. Their joint project is informed by their research into women and salmon fishing, which was prompted by the fact that a woman, Georgina Ballantine, still holds the British salmon fishing record. This might not sound like the most promising of starting points, but the result - a lush, watery installation featuring a floor-level waterbed from which you can watch glossy, green, underwater film - gorgeously makes its point about how women's achievements get lost in the shadows of history. </p> <p>Two noisy show-stealers give the exhibition its mighty confidence. These are Roddy Buchanan's Brazil v Italy (a way-too-loud burst of brass band national anthems without explanation or context) and Ross Sinclair's Real Life installation, a makeshift cardboard structure in sharp contrast to the high-ceilinged refinement of the galleries. Neon-lit and with a pulpit we can all take turns in speaking from, Real Life pumps out the crooning joy of Tony Bennett, with the song that lends its title to the show. \"My world would wear a smile on its face\", he sings. </p> <p>While in Edinburgh brows are furrowed about Britishness, in Glasgow they are smiling and feeling uncomplicatedly at home. <br> Until 20 May.

      "bodyText": "Over in Edinburgh, the British Art Show is raising vexing questions about art and life. Already the organisers have stated that the \"British\" bit of the title is anachronistic and will not be used again. Wandering round the eight galleries, it can indeed be hard to see what yokes together artists such as David Hockney and the young Glaswegian Jim Lambie. Place, history, culture, humour? Do any of these now hold up as nationally shared attributes? Maybe not for the giant British Art Show, but in Glasgow there is a group exhibition all about place and identity - rootedness wherever you might be from. If I Ruled the World is a kind of Summer Holiday of an exhibition, except that artists-turned-curators Ross Sinclair and Bryndis Snaebjornsdottir are driving the bus, instead of Cliff Richard. Commissioned by the CCA, a group of Glasgow-based artists travelled to Reykjavik last year for an exhibition at the Living Art Museum. They soaked up the Icelandic vibes and made work shaped and inspired by the country. Then they came home and made more work, influenced as much by their travels as by their homecoming. The result is a sharp, engaging show which provides us with more evidence of the flourishing Scottish art scene. There are names from the Becks Futures show at the ICA and BA5 - including Roddy Buchanan, Simon Starling and Martin Boyce - but there are others too. The others include Claire Barclay and Clara Ursitti. Their joint project is informed by their research into women and salmon fishing, which was prompted by the fact that a woman, Georgina Ballantine, still holds the British salmon fishing record. This might not sound like the most promising of starting points, but the result - a lush, watery installation featuring a floor-level waterbed from which you can watch glossy, green, underwater film - gorgeously makes its point about how women's achievements get lost in the shadows of history. Two noisy show-stealers give the exhibition its mighty confidence. These are Roddy Buchanan's Brazil v Italy (a way-too-loud burst of brass band national anthems without explanation or context) and Ross Sinclair's Real Life installation, a makeshift cardboard structure in sharp contrast to the high-ceilinged refinement of the galleries. Neon-lit and with a pulpit we can all take turns in speaking from, Real Life pumps out the crooning joy of Tony Bennett, with the song that lends its title to the show. \"My world would wear a smile on its face\", he sings. While in Edinburgh brows are furrowed about Britishness, in Glasgow they are smiling and feeling uncomplicatedly at home. Until 20 May. Details: 0141-332 7521.",

      "body": "<p>Dot.coms may have come off their recent stock market ratings but the flow of jobs available in internet start-ups shows no sign of tailing off. But what if you are an offline person who has never worked on an internet project or in a hi-tech environment - can you use your skills to hop on to the internet bandwagon? And will you be paid any more, or fobbed off with spurious share option schemes? </p> <p>It is still bonanza time for internet job hunters. Check out the classified section of any national newspaper and you will find any number of situations vacant for positions in the internet industry. The even better news is that, although there is a growing influx of web literate graduates moving directly into dot.com world, net businesses are still struggling to fill their vacancies. </p> <p>\"It used to be the case that you got five applications for every job,\" says Selvei Aroldoff, who works in human resources for Organic, a US-owned company specialising in developing all aspects of online activity for businesses and whose clients include Boo.com, BT.com, Daimler Chrysler, Blockbuster and Chase Manhattan. \"Now it feels as if there are five jobs for every applicant.\" </p> <p>Organic itself is not immune to this syndrome. The company opened its London office in May last year with five staff; it now has more than 70 employees and is looking to expand still further. But like everyone else it is struggling to find the right people. </p> <p>One thing's for sure, though. It's not the money that's putting people off. Long gone are the days when dot.coms were a synonym for underpayment. An analysis of comparative rates of pay in the online and offline sectors suggests that, quite apart from any company equity or share options on offer, basic salaries are up to 25% higher for equivalent positions online. Marketing consultants and business analysts who might be earning as little as \u00a315,000 in the old economy can expect up to \u00a360,000 in the new. </p> <p>For graphic designers the salary range leaps from \u00a310,000-\u00a330,000 to \u00a320,000-\u00a350,000; for journalists the salary bracket rises from \u00a310,000-\u00a340,000 to \u00a318,000-\u00a350,000. And it's the same story for architects, IT engineers, accountancy, sales, PR and most of the other specialisms you care to mention. </p> <p>Take advertising. \"There are 300 new internet start-ups each week and they all need experienced account plan ners, marketers and advertising creatives,\" says Vincent Sheppard, managing director of newmediaHR, an advertising recruitment company for e-businesses. \"There is a severe skills shortage in these areas and those who move can expect much higher salaries; for instance an account planner with two years experience can up their basic salary from \u00a330,000 to \u00a340,000.\" </p> <p>However, those who do make the move often face a steep learning curve. \"Even experienced creatives and account planners have to learn the new terminology and business matrices, such as cpm (clicks per mille - a method of determining payments for banner ads) and the effectiveness of interstitial adverts,\" Mr Sheppard continues. But, such is the demand for advertising personnel, newmediaHR goes out of its way to make the transition as painless as possible by offering potential applicants 12 hours free training, spread over four evenings, to get them up to speed. </p> <p>Ms Aroldoff believes one of the main reasons that the new economy is failing to attract applicants in sufficient numbers is that most people working in conventional businesses do not have the imagination to appreciate how their skills can be transferred to web-based activities. </p> <p>\"They look at an ad, read the job description and automatically think they can't do it,\" she says. \"We want to encourage people to look at the bigger picture, to have the confidence to see beyond your traditional role. Think laterally about your skills and come and talk to us about where you might fit in. It could well be that you apply for a strategic position but end up working in new media.\" </p> <p>In webworld, every traditional job has an online equivalent - provided you're prepared to think creatively. So real-world architects morph into information architects, the people who decide how best to arrange webpage content, journalists become online editors, graphic designers become web designers and business consultants turn into interactive strategists. It is a world of apparent plenty, though the differential between online and offline salaries gradually disappears the higher you climb up the dot.com ladder. </p> <p>Louise Campbell is the managing director of Venture Partnership, an executive search company for senior dot.com personnel with starting salaries in excess of \u00a370,000. \"Two years ago, there were far fewer e-business opportunities,\" she says, \"and those wanting to take them were expected to take a cut in basic salary for the privilege, though they might well also have been offered a share of the company in comparison. These days, there are more dot.com openings and applicants can be far pickier, with the result that salaries have increased to the offline market rate.\" </p> <p>Among the key positions currently proving trickiest to fill are marketing directors, content directors and chief technology officers, though Ms Campbell offers an important caveat. \"Internet companies are still recruiting these personnel from offline businesses,\" she says, \"but by this time next year this window may have closed and recruitment may be limited to those with internet experience.\" </p> <p>So if you fancy your chances online, the message is clear. Do it now. But be careful of what you are getting into. Not every dot.com is rock solid, and even those with business plans that ap pear to be fireproof can fail. Very few internet companies offer pensions, and stock options and a mega starting salary will mean very little if the company goes under within a year. But there again, you might just think: \"Who cares if the dot.com I'm working for goes down?\" There are five more queueing up round the corner to pick up the fallout. </p> <p> <strong> How to choose the right dot.com</strong> </p> <p> Find out who the backers are and who is lending their name to the business. </p> <p>Find out what stage of funding the business has reached. If it is still at venture capital stage then ask who they are and what their track record is. </p> <p>Ask yourself how solid the basic business idea is. What is the business plan and is it realistic? </p> <p>There is no such thing as an original business idea, so its success or failure will depend largely on who else is working for the company. Find out exactly who these people are. </p> <p> <strong> Know the risk</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Low</strong> : a traditional offline business that is looking to develop its online activities. </p> <p><strong> Medium</strong> : a start-up that has successfully floated in the US and is looking to launch in this country. </p> <p><strong> High</strong> : a UK start-up with no track record.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Dot.coms may have come off their recent stock market ratings but the flow of jobs available in internet start-ups shows no sign of tailing off. But what if you are an offline person who has never worked on an internet project or in a hi-tech environment - can you use your skills to hop on to the internet bandwagon? And will you be paid any more, or fobbed off with spurious share option schemes? It is still bonanza time for internet job hunters. Check out the classified section of any national newspaper and you will find any number of situations vacant for positions in the internet industry. The even better news is that, although there is a growing influx of web literate graduates moving directly into dot.com world, net businesses are still struggling to fill their vacancies. \"It used to be the case that you got five applications for every job,\" says Selvei Aroldoff, who works in human resources for Organic, a US-owned company specialising in developing all aspects of online activity for businesses and whose clients include Boo.com, BT.com, Daimler Chrysler, Blockbuster and Chase Manhattan. \"Now it feels as if there are five jobs for every applicant.\" Organic itself is not immune to this syndrome. The company opened its London office in May last year with five staff; it now has more than 70 employees and is looking to expand still further. But like everyone else it is struggling to find the right people. One thing's for sure, though. It's not the money that's putting people off. Long gone are the days when dot.coms were a synonym for underpayment. An analysis of comparative rates of pay in the online and offline sectors suggests that, quite apart from any company equity or share options on offer, basic salaries are up to 25% higher for equivalent positions online. Marketing consultants and business analysts who might be earning as little as \u00a315,000 in the old economy can expect up to \u00a360,000 in the new. For graphic designers the salary range leaps from \u00a310,000-\u00a330,000 to \u00a320,000-\u00a350,000; for journalists the salary bracket rises from \u00a310,000-\u00a340,000 to \u00a318,000-\u00a350,000. And it's the same story for architects, IT engineers, accountancy, sales, PR and most of the other specialisms you care to mention. Take advertising. \"There are 300 new internet start-ups each week and they all need experienced account plan ners, marketers and advertising creatives,\" says Vincent Sheppard, managing director of newmediaHR, an advertising recruitment company for e-businesses. \"There is a severe skills shortage in these areas and those who move can expect much higher salaries; for instance an account planner with two years experience can up their basic salary from \u00a330,000 to \u00a340,000.\" However, those who do make the move often face a steep learning curve. \"Even experienced creatives and account planners have to learn the new terminology and business matrices, such as cpm (clicks per mille - a method of determining payments for banner ads) and the effectiveness of interstitial adverts,\" Mr Sheppard continues. But, such is the demand for advertising personnel, newmediaHR goes out of its way to make the transition as painless as possible by offering potential applicants 12 hours free training, spread over four evenings, to get them up to speed. Ms Aroldoff believes one of the main reasons that the new economy is failing to attract applicants in sufficient numbers is that most people working in conventional businesses do not have the imagination to appreciate how their skills can be transferred to web-based activities. \"They look at an ad, read the job description and automatically think they can't do it,\" she says. \"We want to encourage people to look at the bigger picture, to have the confidence to see beyond your traditional role. Think laterally about your skills and come and talk to us about where you might fit in. It could well be that you apply for a strategic position but end up working in new media.\" In webworld, every traditional job has an online equivalent - provided you're prepared to think creatively. So real-world architects morph into information architects, the people who decide how best to arrange webpage content, journalists become online editors, graphic designers become web designers and business consultants turn into interactive strategists. It is a world of apparent plenty, though the differential between online and offline salaries gradually disappears the higher you climb up the dot.com ladder. Louise Campbell is the managing director of Venture Partnership, an executive search company for senior dot.com personnel with starting salaries in excess of \u00a370,000. \"Two years ago, there were far fewer e-business opportunities,\" she says, \"and those wanting to take them were expected to take a cut in basic salary for the privilege, though they might well also have been offered a share of the company in comparison. These days, there are more dot.com openings and applicants can be far pickier, with the result that salaries have increased to the offline market rate.\" Among the key positions currently proving trickiest to fill are marketing directors, content directors and chief technology officers, though Ms Campbell offers an important caveat. \"Internet companies are still recruiting these personnel from offline businesses,\" she says, \"but by this time next year this window may have closed and recruitment may be limited to those with internet experience.\" So if you fancy your chances online, the message is clear. Do it now. But be careful of what you are getting into. Not every dot.com is rock solid, and even those with business plans that ap pear to be fireproof can fail. Very few internet companies offer pensions, and stock options and a mega starting salary will mean very little if the company goes under within a year. But there again, you might just think: \"Who cares if the dot.com I'm working for goes down?\" There are five more queueing up round the corner to pick up the fallout. How to choose the right dot.com Find out who the backers are and who is lending their name to the business. Find out what stage of funding the business has reached. If it is still at venture capital stage then ask who they are and what their track record is. Ask yourself how solid the basic business idea is. What is the business plan and is it realistic? There is no such thing as an original business idea, so its success or failure will depend largely on who else is working for the company. Find out exactly who these people are. Know the risk Low : a traditional offline business that is looking to develop its online activities. Medium : a start-up that has successfully floated in the US and is looking to launch in this country. High : a UK start-up with no track record.",

      "body": "<p>As Clement Atlee cleared away the last vestiges of post-war rationing and austerity in 1950 few could have guessed that Britain stood on the brink of a stock market bonanza, or that government bonds, safe as houses during the deflationary 20s and 30s, would turn out to be an investment disaster. </p> <p>An investment of \u00a3100 in shares in 1950 grew to \u00a388,896 by the end of 1999, or \u00a33,896 after inflation is stripped out. But \u00a3100 put into government bonds - known as gilts - would have risen to just \u00a33,316, or a paltry \u00a3145 after being adjusted for inflation. </p> <p>The figures come from Barclays Capital, which this week issued its annual equity-gilt study. It shows that in every decade since the war, the average annual return on equities has beaten the return from gilts, often by a large margin. </p> <p>Surprisingly, the figures show that the shares bonanza was even bigger in the 50s than it has been in the last two decades. The three best years on the UK stock market in the last half century (barring the freak year of 1975) were 1959, 1958 and 1954. </p> <p>In 1959 the stock market went up 54.8% - far ahead of the biggest increase in the last decade, 1993, when the market went up 27.5%. The freak years were 1973-1975, when the figures were distorted by runaway inflation and the near-complete, if very brief, collapse in the stock market. In 1973, the market fell 28%, slumped another 50% in 1974, then jumped 149% in 1975. Since 1975 the stock market has recorded a year-on-year fall only twice - in 1990 and 1994. </p> <p>Barclays has produced its equity-gilt study for 45 years, and every year the message to investors is that buying shares rather than bonds is a no-brainer. The other message is that it is crucial to reinvest any dividends from your investments. Reinvestment of dividends makes up around half of the long-term gain on shares. </p> <p>But the report cannot hide the fact that the figures on government bonds have started to look a lot better in recent decades. </p> <p>Last year was a grim year for gilts, which dropped 3.5% in value. Likewise, it was a grim year for buyers of corporate bond Peps, which saw reversals of around 10%. But 1999 was only the second year in the past two decades in which the value of gilts fell. As inflation has dropped back from its peak in the 70s, and fallen to what many economists believe is near-permanent low levels, gilts have sparkled.

      "bodyText": "As Clement Atlee cleared away the last vestiges of post-war rationing and austerity in 1950 few could have guessed that Britain stood on the brink of a stock market bonanza, or that government bonds, safe as houses during the deflationary 20s and 30s, would turn out to be an investment disaster. An investment of \u00a3100 in shares in 1950 grew to \u00a388,896 by the end of 1999, or \u00a33,896 after inflation is stripped out. But \u00a3100 put into government bonds - known as gilts - would have risen to just \u00a33,316, or a paltry \u00a3145 after being adjusted for inflation. The figures come from Barclays Capital, which this week issued its annual equity-gilt study. It shows that in every decade since the war, the average annual return on equities has beaten the return from gilts, often by a large margin. Surprisingly, the figures show that the shares bonanza was even bigger in the 50s than it has been in the last two decades. The three best years on the UK stock market in the last half century (barring the freak year of 1975) were 1959, 1958 and 1954. In 1959 the stock market went up 54.8% - far ahead of the biggest increase in the last decade, 1993, when the market went up 27.5%. The freak years were 1973-1975, when the figures were distorted by runaway inflation and the near-complete, if very brief, collapse in the stock market. In 1973, the market fell 28%, slumped another 50% in 1974, then jumped 149% in 1975. Since 1975 the stock market has recorded a year-on-year fall only twice - in 1990 and 1994. Barclays has produced its equity-gilt study for 45 years, and every year the message to investors is that buying shares rather than bonds is a no-brainer. The other message is that it is crucial to reinvest any dividends from your investments. Reinvestment of dividends makes up around half of the long-term gain on shares. But the report cannot hide the fact that the figures on government bonds have started to look a lot better in recent decades. Last year was a grim year for gilts, which dropped 3.5% in value. Likewise, it was a grim year for buyers of corporate bond Peps, which saw reversals of around 10%. But 1999 was only the second year in the past two decades in which the value of gilts fell. As inflation has dropped back from its peak in the 70s, and fallen to what many economists believe is near-permanent low levels, gilts have sparkled. In five out of the last eight years, they have given investors returns exceeding 15% a year. Barclays believes that such superb gilt returns are a one-off adjustment to low inflation and are unlikely to be repeated over the next decade. But it is keeping its faith with shares, despite the stratospheric levels that equities have reached on most traditional valuation measures. \"We have plenty of reasons to be optimistic,\" it says. First computers and now the internet have speeded up the rate of technological change (and therefore economic growth) while the worldwide web in effect automates the process of change, by disseminating information almost immediately. But rapid technological change will make stock markets far more speculative, as one hi-tech bubble is supplanted by the next. \"The outlook is close to perfect for equities... but the rapid pace of innovation will ensure that equity markets will retain a strongly speculative character: cycling through booms, busts, panics and manias with an unprecedented frequency,\" opines Barclays Capital director Tim Bond. But before you pile your money into shares, Barclays adds a very big caveat to its predictions about future returns. The big caveat is that Britain is ageing rapidly and the population will even start falling in the 2030s and 2040s. Right now it doesn't matter - it's positive for stock markets, as the post-war baby-boomers (now in their 40s) save hard for their retirement. That money goes into pension plans and thence on to the stock market, chasing share prices upwards. The pain comes when the baby boomers start retiring - and the crunch point will be some time after 2010. Then the pension companies will have to start selling shares to pay out pensions, pushing share prices downwards. Barclays says: \"The demographics are good for 10 years. After 2010, demographics become less friendly for financial markets as the growth in the labour force slows or reverses and as dependency ratios rise in line with the ageing of the population.\" So what does that mean for your pension? One thing for sure is that the spectacular total pension pot figures given in some projections are unlikely to be achieved. A second point is that today's 30-year-olds ought not to rely on share investments alone, and should look at property investment as a supplement. While a prolonged sell-off of shares to pay income to pensioners will depress share prices, when we are all elderly we will still need somewhere to live.",

      "body": "<p>American Psycho is a novel that aspires to the condition of cinema. It has fade-ins and fade-outs, an obsessive visual detailing of what characters wear and what rooms look like, cinematic violence - and most of all it has a soundtrack. Mary Harron's film of the book is its inevitable consummation. In the very first paragraph, a character aware that riding in the back of a taxi through Manhattan venting spleen at the traffic may be a bit Marty-like, introduces another Scorsese allusion when he \"tells the driver he will give him $5 to turn up the radio, Be My Baby on WYNN...\" </p> <p>The Ronettes' Be My Baby is the song on the opening credits to Martin Scorsese's Mean Streets, from 1973. American Psycho's narrator, Patrick Bateman, is a Scorsese psycho transplanted from the mean streets to Wall Street, living in a fantasy world structured by the soundtrack in his head. He interrupts his tale of killings with essays on the music that means most to him: he loves Genesis, but only since their 1980 album Duke - when Phil Collins emerged as leader. He loves Whitney Houston. He adores Huey Lewis and the News. </p> <p>There is a history to this way of thinking about pop music. Cinema as we experience it began in the 70s with the new wave of US film-makers for whom the sound of pop and rock was integral to the way they saw the world. The pop soundtrack defines contemporary cinema and, ever since Taxi Driver and Apocalypse Now, the sound of pop has accompanied images of violence, murder and brutality. </p> <p>In 1975's Taxi Driver, Travis Bickle was a character so out of sync with his times that he didn't know who Kris Kristofferson was, and watched blankly as people danced to a soul show on television. But Bateman, like all of us now, lives life to a soundtrack; pop has become a structuring presence in our lives, something that counterpoints every great event from falling in love to killing someone.</p> <p>This is a habit of thought we got from the movies and most of all from the films of the 70s. \"Do you enjoy K Billy's Sounds of the 70s? It's my personal favourite,\" says Mr Blonde as he prepares to torture a young cop to a radio show in Reservoir Dogs - when pop's history became long and gory enough for it to be quoted, discussed and analysed as part of the fabric of films. The generation of directors who transformed cinema in the 70s grew up in the 60s to a soundtrack of Motown, the Stones and psychedelia; they grew up in the counterculture; they were the first generation of film-makers for whom pop was something with deep emotional meaning. </p> <p>But why is that meaning so blood-spattered? Why has pop music become so indelibly associated in films with brutality, mayhem and psychosis? It was one thing for Francis Coppola to suggest in The Godfather that Frank Sinatra - one of whose early hits the Godfather's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 sings at his daughter's wedding before having the family advance his career with the help of a horse's head - provided the soundtrack to mob violence. It is another to take the hippy escapism of Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells, as William Friedkin did in The Exorcist, and reveal this jingle-jangle music as the sound of Satan. </p> <p>Pop became the soundtrack to violence in films when it became the soundtrack to violence in reality. The secret source for every ironic counterpoising of rock and slaughter may be the Maysles brothers' 1970 documentary of the Stones' Altamont concert, Gimme Shelter, which shows murder right in front of the stage as they play. But then rock 'n' roll began as music of rebellion, menace and outsiderdom, and Kenneth Anger's 1963 underground classic Scorpio Rising - perhaps the very first film to use a sampled rock soundtrack - dredges darkness from the heart of pop in juxtaposing the sweet ballad Blue Velvet with a biker gang's vicious rituals. </p> <p>Through all the classic juxtapositions of sweet sounds and casual violence, interpretations of our music and our culture are being advanced. Is our culture banal and anaesthetised to violence? For Stanley Kubrick in A Clockwork Orange, pop is the soundtrack of psychosis; the synthesised Beethoven and musical numbers that Alex enjoys are the music of cultural death. In the record shop where he hangs out, pop culture is cruelly caricatured as teenagers buy records by The Heaven Seventeen, Black Christmas by Cyclops and The Sparks. Some of these groups later became real. In Scorsese's films, pop is not something to satirise but the core of his sensibility; he has remembered how when he grew up in Manhattan's Lower East Side there would always be music playing and before he directed anything he edited the film of Woodstock. </p> <p>In Scorsese's films, music is full of meaning and passion and hints of redemption; the music that plays when violence is being done hints at another world in which this could not happen. In his most violent film - emotionally if not physically - The King of Comedy, the streets are full of music (with cameos by the Clash) that Robert De Niro's fascistic TV wannabe doesn't hear. If he did, he would be a different person. Patrick Bateman would be a different person if he could understand why Phil Collins' sversion of You Can't Hurry Love is not, as he claims, a huge improvement on the 60s original. \"How can we stand the violence?\" asks Van Morrison over the end credits of The King of Comedy, and that's the question all these films ask.</p> <p> <strong> Mean Streets </strong><br>(Martin Scorsese , 1973) <br><strong>Please Mr Postman, The Marvelettes, 1961</strong></p> <p>Charlie (Harvey Keitel), Johnny Boy (Robert De Niro) and their crew visit a pool hall on New York's Lower East Side to collect a debt. Everything is going fine, and they are about to shake on the deal to the sound of Motown from a jukebox, until Johnny Boy launches into a stream of unprovoked insults at the pool hall, its clients and its proprietor.</p> <p>\"That's it, we're not paying,\" says the guy. \"We're not paying because he's a mook.\" \"A mook, what's a mook?\" They fight, in a sequence edited to the rhythms of Please Mr Postman. As the Marvelettes sing of love and longing - all they want is a love letter - Johnny Boy bestrides a pool table beating away three men with a broken-off cue. As the film progresses, the choreography of music and violence becomes ever darker until Johnny Boy is shot to an Eric Clapton guitar solo. </p> <p>More about <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Title?0070379\">Mean Streets</a></p> <p><strong> A Clockwork Orange </strong><br>(Stanley Kubrick, 1971)<br><strong>Singin' in the Rain, Gene Kelly, 1929/1952</strong><br></p> <p>In Anthony Burgess's novel Alex has a passion for Beethoven, which means he has a soul. Kubrick is more sceptical about the value of art, and in the film, when Alex is made to watch Nazi atrocities to Beethoven (as part of the Lodovico Method of behavioural therapy) the music seems to go all too well with the horrors on screen. Alex's most memorable musical moment is when he performs Singin' in the Rain as he cuts off Adrienne Corri's clothes before raping her. </p> <p>Singin' in the Rain was a hit in 1929 before being used in the Gene Kelly musical, where it's a celebration of rebirth after a silent star's career is ended by the arrival of soundtracks. After seeing atrocities to a Beethoven soundtrack, Alex can no longer listen to the composer; after seeing A Clockwork Orange, you can never hear Singin' in the Rain in the same way.</p> <p>More about <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Title?0066921\">A Clockwork Orange</a></p> <p><strong> Performance </strong><br> (Donald Cammell and Nicolas Roeg, 1970)<br><strong>Uncredited blues guitar solo</strong></p> <p>Gangster Chas (James Fox) wants to put the frighteners on a lawyer so he and his lads barge into the mews garage where the lawyer keeps his Rolls-Royce. They beat up a chauffeur, tie him to the radiator and shave his head. Then Chas starts to pour acid on the car - it bubbles and hisses, burning and scarring the smooth paint. We are terrified he is about to start on the chauffeur. A gangster turns on the car radio and we hear sleazy Keith Richards-style guitar.</p> <p>Doing it to music seems to suggest that there's a vicious art to Chas's violence, his \"performance\": his grotesque ritual of torture is choreographed. It rocks. The camera dwells on the patterns his acid makes on the car body and it looks like abstract art. The blues guitar - later to return when Mick Jagger performs Memo From Turner - implies that violence is beauty, beauty violence.</p> <p>More about <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Title?0066214\">Performance</a></p> <p><strong> Scarface </strong><br> (Brian De Palma, 1983) <br><strong>Shake It Up, Elizabeth Daily, 1983</strong></p> <p>Cuban gangster Tony Montana (Al Pacino) and colleague try to do a drug deal in a Miami hotel room while the rest of the gang wait outside in the car. A row with the dealers results in Tony and his brother-in-law being tied up in the bathroom as the head drug dealer produces a chainsaw.</p> <p>As he prepares to cut Tony's brother-in-law to pieces, the camera sidles out of the bathroom, through a window, across the street to where the back-up are listening to Shake It Up - a piece of nondescript MOR rock by soundtrack composer Giorgio Moroder - on the car radio. Then we pan back, to the growl of the chainsaw... De Palma often uses this kind of music (bad rock, bad synth) in a way that is oddly affecting because it reflects the desperate lives of his characters. Tony Montana's life and death are played out to disco kitsch.</p> <p>More about <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Title?0086250\">Scarface</a></p> <p><strong> Apocalypse Now </strong><br> (Francis Ford Coppola , 1979) <br><strong>The End, The Doors, 1972</strong></p> <p>\"Everyone wanted me to do it, even he wanted me to do it,\" says Martin Sheen in voiceover as he prepares to slaughter Marlon Brando's Major Kurtz. Coppola intercuts the killing with the sacrificial slaughter of a beast by Kurtz's crazed followers, and on the soundtrack come the dung-dung-dung opening notes of The Doors' attempt to translate Greek tragedy into psychedelic pop in The End.</p> <p>Apocalypse Now puts the counterculture that imagined itself in opposition to Vietnam on the frontline of the war itself. The use of The Doors is particularly apt as Jim Morrison's father was a US admiral, and Jim's psychotic confession in The End (\"Father, I want to kill you\") was clearly genuine. Here, metaphorically, his wish comes true.</p> <p>More about <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Title?0078788\">Apocalypse Now</a></p> <p><strong> GoodFellas </strong><br> (Martin Scorsese, 1990) <br><strong>Atlantis, Donovan, 1968</strong></p> <p>Mobsters Jimmy (Robert De Niro), Tommy (Joe Pesci) and narrator Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) are drinking in a bar owned by Henry while Billy Batts, a senior gangster just out of jail, has a sparsely attended coming-out party at the other end of the bar.</p> <p>Batts taunts Tommy by reminding everyone how he used to shine shoes as a boy. They make up and everything seems settled. \"Now go and get your fucking shine-box,\" says Batts. After being pulled off him, Tommy returns at closing time and, as Henry locks the door, he and Jimmy kick and stamp Batts to death (so they think - actually he has to be finished later). Over the entire kicking sequence we hear the incongruous sound of Donovan's 1968 psychedelic idyll Atlantis, which he wrote after visiting the Maharishi with the Beatles. Like a lot of the music in GoodFellas, this is the sound of another reality that the gangsters, with their Sinatra style, don't know exists.</p> <p>More about <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Title?0099685\">Goodfellas</a></p> <p><strong> Blue Velvet </strong><br> (David Lynch, 1986) <br><strong>In Dreams, Roy Orbison, 1963</strong></p> <p>Frank (Dennis Hopper), the underworld weirdo, gets innocent do-gooder Kyle MacLachlan alone in his car in the woods at night. On the car radio is Frank's favourite song, In Dreams. Hopper kisses his victim on the mouth. They are both covered in Isabella Rossellini's lipstick. He speaks the song's lyrics, out of sync with Orbison, his face contorted in pain: \"In dreams... I walk with you.\" Then he begins to punch MacLachlan in the face. Blue Velvet reads astonishing depths of menace in Orbison's 1963 hit, which is played again and again in ever weirder ways. It's the most disturbing use ever made of pop in that it convincingly makes early 60s music sound like a source of unnameable horrors.</p> <p>More about <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Title?0090756\">Blue Velvet</a></p> <p><strong> Reservoir Dogs </strong><br> (Quentin Tarantino, 1991) <br><strong>Stuck in the Middle with You, Stealer's Wheel, 1973</strong></p> <p>As Mr Blonde (Michael Madsen) begins to torture an undercover policeman (Tim Roth) in a warehouse, this song comes on the car radio. This is, in a sense, a pastiche of all the scenes listed on this page; it marks the moment when we become so aware of pop's - and film's - quotability that the moment Mr Blonde puts on the radio, you know this is going to be really horrible.</p> <p>Stuck In The Middle With You is a song whose meaning is elusive and uncomfortable (\"I've a feeling that something ain't right\") and somehow vacuous; the horror lies in the lack of meaning implied by Mr Blonde's liking it. He does his torture as a dance to the music. It's only when the spell of the music is over that we are freed, and the cop shoots him.</p> <p>More about <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Title?0105236\">Reservoir Dogs</a></p> <p><strong> Dr Strangelove </strong><br> (Stanley Kubrick, 1964) <br><strong>We'll Meet Again, Vera Lynn, 1939</strong></p> <p>As the first bomb is dropped, Peter Sellers' Dr Strangelove wrestles with his artificial arm and explains how it would be possible for the world's elite to live underground for 100 years to escape nuclear death. Then we cut to real films of nuclear tests to the sound of Vera Lynn.</p> <p>\"We'll meet again,\" promises that brassy 40s voice, as mushroom clouds and lateral flashes of light illuminate the sky. The song comes from a time when war could be contemplated as a necessary, noble cause; but now war is this post-human spectacle of beautiful mushroom clouds, each one signalling hundreds of thousands of deaths. We'll Meet Again - it's a promise, too. We will meet this scene again, says Kubrick, and this time we won't be watching from above. Or perhaps, as Dr Strangelove expounds his eugenic plans, we'll meet the Nazis again.</p> <p>More about <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Title?0057012\">Dr Strangelove</a></p> <p><strong> Superfly </strong><br> (Gordon Parks Jnr, 1972) <br><strong>Think, Curtis Mayfield, 1972</strong></p> <p>A black drug dealer is driven off by white cops - who are in reality working for the city's police commissioner and top gangster - to the sound of a soulful instrumental by Mayfield, whose soundtrack to this blaxploitation thriller is a brilliant commentary on the film and its violent world. As the music goes on, the car pulls up in the shadow of the elevated railroad, and a cop takes out a syringe. As the victim pleads for his life, he is injected with a lethal dose of heroin and left to die. We see his face one last time through the window, to the sweet melancholy music.</p> <p>Mayfield appears in the film singing Pusherman, an ironic counterpoise to the story of how a pusher gets out of the business. Mayfield's darkest song and the biggest hit on the soundtrack album, Freddie's Dead, is not in the film, but even so, his bouncy yet sad music gives Superfly a poetic quality that lingers.</p> <p>More about <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Title?0069332\">Superfly</a></p>",

In the very first paragraph, a character aware that riding in the back of a taxi through Manhattan venting spleen at the traffic may be a bit Marty-like, introduces another Scorsese allusion when he \"tells the driver he will give him $5 to turn up the radio, Be My Baby on WYNN...\" The Ronettes' Be My Baby is the song on the opening credits to Martin Scorsese's Mean Streets, from 1973. American Psycho's narrator, Patrick Bateman, is a Scorsese psycho transplanted from the mean streets to Wall Street, living in a fantasy world structured by the soundtrack in his head. He interrupts his tale of killings with essays on the music that means most to him: he loves Genesis, but only since their 1980 album Duke - when Phil Collins emerged as leader. He loves Whitney Houston. He adores Huey Lewis and the News. There is a history to this way of thinking about pop music. Cinema as we experience it began in the 70s with the new wave of US film-makers for whom the sound of pop and rock was integral to the way they saw the world. The pop soundtrack defines contemporary cinema and, ever since Taxi Driver and Apocalypse Now, the sound of pop has accompanied images of violence, murder and brutality. In 1975's Taxi Driver, Travis Bickle was a character so out of sync with his times that he didn't know who Kris Kristofferson was, and watched blankly as people danced to a soul show on television. But Bateman, like all of us now, lives life to a soundtrack; pop has become a structuring presence in our lives, something that counterpoints every great event from falling in love to killing someone. This is a habit of thought we got from the movies and most of all from the films of the 70s. \"Do you enjoy K Billy's Sounds of the 70s? It's my personal favourite,\" says Mr Blonde as he prepares to torture a young cop to a radio show in Reservoir Dogs - when pop's history became long and gory enough for it to be quoted, discussed and analysed as part of the fabric of films. The generation of directors who transformed cinema in the 70s grew up in the 60s to a soundtrack of Motown, the Stones and psychedelia; they grew up in the counterculture; they were the first generation of film-makers for whom pop was something with deep emotional meaning. But why is that meaning so blood-spattered? Why has pop music become so indelibly associated in films with brutality, mayhem and psychosis? It was one thing for Francis Coppola to suggest in The Godfather that Frank Sinatra - one of whose early hits the Godfather's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 sings at his daughter's wedding before having the family advance his career with the help of a horse's head - provided the soundtrack to mob violence. It is another to take the hippy escapism of Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells, as William Friedkin did in The Exorcist, and reveal this jingle-jangle music as the sound of Satan. Pop became the soundtrack to violence in films when it became the soundtrack to violence in reality. The secret source for every ironic counterpoising of rock and slaughter may be the Maysles brothers' 1970 documentary of the Stones' Altamont concert, Gimme Shelter, which shows murder right in front of the stage as they play. But then rock 'n' roll began as music of rebellion, menace and outsiderdom, and Kenneth Anger's 1963 underground classic Scorpio Rising - perhaps the very first film to use a sampled rock soundtrack - dredges darkness from the heart of pop in juxtaposing the sweet ballad Blue Velvet with a biker gang's vicious rituals. Through all the classic juxtapositions of sweet sounds and casual violence, interpretations of our music and our culture are being advanced. Is our culture banal and anaesthetised to violence? For Stanley Kubrick in A Clockwork Orange, pop is the soundtrack of psychosis; the synthesised Beethoven and musical numbers that Alex enjoys are the music of cultural death. In the record shop where he hangs out, pop culture is cruelly caricatured as teenagers buy records by The Heaven Seventeen, Black Christmas by Cyclops and The Sparks. Some of these groups later became real. In Scorsese's films, pop is not something to satirise but the core of his sensibility; he has remembered how when he grew up in Manhattan's Lower East Side there would always be music playing and before he directed anything he edited the film of Woodstock. In Scorsese's films, music is full of meaning and passion and hints of redemption; the music that plays when violence is being done hints at another world in which this could not happen. In his most violent film - emotionally if not physically - The King of Comedy, the streets are full of music (with cameos by the Clash) that Robert De Niro's fascistic TV wannabe doesn't hear. If he did, he would be a different person. Patrick Bateman would be a different person if he could understand why Phil Collins' sversion of You Can't Hurry Love is not, as he claims, a huge improvement on the 60s original. \"How can we stand the violence?\" asks Van Morrison over the end credits of The King of Comedy, and that's the question all these films ask. Mean Streets (Martin Scorsese , 1973) Please Mr Postman, The Marvelettes, 1961 Charlie (Harvey Keitel), Johnny Boy (Robert De Niro) and their crew visit a pool hall on New York's Lower East Side to collect a debt. Everything is going fine, and they are about to shake on the deal to the sound of Motown from a jukebox, until Johnny Boy launches into a stream of unprovoked insults at the pool hall, its clients and its proprietor. \"That's it, we're not paying,\" says the guy. \"We're not paying because he's a mook.\" \"A mook, what's a mook?\" They fight, in a sequence edited to the rhythms of Please Mr Postman. As the Marvelettes sing of love and longing - all they want is a love letter - Johnny Boy bestrides a pool table beating away three men with a broken-off cue. As the film progresses, the choreography of music and violence becomes ever darker until Johnny Boy is shot to an Eric Clapton guitar solo. More about Mean Streets A Clockwork Orange (Stanley Kubrick, 1971) Singin' in the Rain, Gene Kelly, 1929/1952 In Anthony Burgess's novel Alex has a passion for Beethoven, which means he has a soul. Kubrick is more sceptical about the value of art, and in the film, when Alex is made to watch Nazi atrocities to Beethoven (as part of the Lodovico Method of behavioural therapy) the music seems to go all too well with the horrors on screen. Alex's most memorable musical moment is when he performs Singin' in the Rain as he cuts off Adrienne Corri's clothes before raping her. Singin' in the Rain was a hit in 1929 before being used in the Gene Kelly musical, where it's a celebration of rebirth after a silent star's career is ended by the arrival of soundtracks. After seeing atrocities to a Beethoven soundtrack, Alex can no longer listen to the composer; after seeing A Clockwork Orange, you can never hear Singin' in the Rain in the same way. More about A Clockwork Orange Performance (Donald Cammell and Nicolas Roeg, 1970) Uncredited blues guitar solo Gangster Chas (James Fox) wants to put the frighteners on a lawyer so he and his lads barge into the mews garage where the lawyer keeps his Rolls-Royce. They beat up a chauffeur, tie him to the radiator and shave his head. Then Chas starts to pour acid on the car - it bubbles and hisses, burning and scarring the smooth paint. We are terrified he is about to start on the chauffeur. A gangster turns on the car radio and we hear sleazy Keith Richards-style guitar. Doing it to music seems to suggest that there's a vicious art to Chas's violence, his \"performance\": his grotesque ritual of torture is choreographed. It rocks. The camera dwells on the patterns his acid makes on the car body and it looks like abstract art. The blues guitar - later to return when Mick Jagger performs Memo From Turner - implies that violence is beauty, beauty violence. More about Performance Scarface (Brian De Palma, 1983) Shake It Up, Elizabeth Daily, 1983 Cuban gangster Tony Montana (Al Pacino) and colleague try to do a drug deal in a Miami hotel room while the rest of the gang wait outside in the car. A row with the dealers results in Tony and his brother-in-law being tied up in the bathroom as the head drug dealer produces a chainsaw. As he prepares to cut Tony's brother-in-law to pieces, the camera sidles out of the bathroom, through a window, across the street to where the back-up are listening to Shake It Up - a piece of nondescript MOR rock by soundtrack composer Giorgio Moroder - on the car radio. Then we pan back, to the growl of the chainsaw... De Palma often uses this kind of music (bad rock, bad synth) in a way that is oddly affecting because it reflects the desperate lives of his characters. Tony Montana's life and death are played out to disco kitsch. More about Scarface Apocalypse Now (Francis Ford Coppola , 1979) The End, The Doors, 1972 \"Everyone wanted me to do it, even he wanted me to do it,\" says Martin Sheen in voiceover as he prepares to slaughter Marlon Brando's Major Kurtz. Coppola intercuts the killing with the sacrificial slaughter of a beast by Kurtz's crazed followers, and on the soundtrack come the dung-dung-dung opening notes of The Doors' attempt to translate Greek tragedy into psychedelic pop in The End. Apocalypse Now puts the counterculture that imagined itself in opposition to Vietnam on the frontline of the war itself. The use of The Doors is particularly apt as Jim Morrison's father was a US admiral, and Jim's psychotic confession in The End (\"Father, I want to kill you\") was clearly genuine. Here, metaphorically, his wish comes true. More about Apocalypse Now GoodFellas (Martin Scorsese, 1990) Atlantis, Donovan, 1968 Mobsters Jimmy (Robert De Niro), Tommy (Joe Pesci) and narrator Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) are drinking in a bar owned by Henry while Billy Batts, a senior gangster just out of jail, has a sparsely attended coming-out party at the other end of the bar. Batts taunts Tommy by reminding everyone how he used to shine shoes as a boy. They make up and everything seems settled. \"Now go and get your fucking shine-box,\" says Batts. After being pulled off him, Tommy returns at closing time and, as Henry locks the door, he and Jimmy kick and stamp Batts to death (so they think - actually he has to be finished later). Over the entire kicking sequence we hear the incongruous sound of Donovan's 1968 psychedelic idyll Atlantis, which he wrote after visiting the Maharishi with the Beatles. Like a lot of the music in GoodFellas, this is the sound of another reality that the gangsters, with their Sinatra style, don't know exists. More about Goodfellas Blue Velvet (David Lynch, 1986) In Dreams, Roy Orbison, 1963 Frank (Dennis Hopper), the underworld weirdo, gets innocent do-gooder Kyle MacLachlan alone in his car in the woods at night. On the car radio is Frank's favourite song, In Dreams. Hopper kisses his victim on the mouth. They are both covered in Isabella Rossellini's lipstick. He speaks the song's lyrics, out of sync with Orbison, his face contorted in pain: \"In dreams... I walk with you.\" Then he begins to punch MacLachlan in the face. Blue Velvet reads astonishing depths of menace in Orbison's 1963 hit, which is played again and again in ever weirder ways. It's the most disturbing use ever made of pop in that it convincingly makes early 60s music sound like a source of unnameable horrors. More about Blue Velvet Reservoir Dogs (Quentin Tarantino, 1991) Stuck in the Middle with You, Stealer's Wheel, 1973 As Mr Blonde (Michael Madsen) begins to torture an undercover policeman (Tim Roth) in a warehouse, this song comes on the car radio. This is, in a sense, a pastiche of all the scenes listed on this page; it marks the moment when we become so aware of pop's - and film's - quotability that the moment Mr Blonde puts on the radio, you know this is going to be really horrible. Stuck In The Middle With You is a song whose meaning is elusive and uncomfortable (\"I've a feeling that something ain't right\") and somehow vacuous; the horror lies in the lack of meaning implied by Mr Blonde's liking it. He does his torture as a dance to the music. It's only when the spell of the music is over that we are freed, and the cop shoots him. More about Reservoir Dogs Dr Strangelove (Stanley Kubrick, 1964) We'll Meet Again, Vera Lynn, 1939 As the first bomb is dropped, Peter Sellers' Dr Strangelove wrestles with his artificial arm and explains how it would be possible for the world's elite to live underground for 100 years to escape nuclear death. Then we cut to real films of nuclear tests to the sound of Vera Lynn. \"We'll meet again,\" promises that brassy 40s voice, as mushroom clouds and lateral flashes of light illuminate the sky. The song comes from a time when war could be contemplated as a necessary, noble cause; but now war is this post-human spectacle of beautiful mushroom clouds, each one signalling hundreds of thousands of deaths. We'll Meet Again - it's a promise, too. We will meet this scene again, says Kubrick, and this time we won't be watching from above. Or perhaps, as Dr Strangelove expounds his eugenic plans, we'll meet the Nazis again. More about Dr Strangelove Superfly (Gordon Parks Jnr, 1972) Think, Curtis Mayfield, 1972 A black drug dealer is driven off by white cops - who are in reality working for the city's police commissioner and top gangster - to the sound of a soulful instrumental by Mayfield, whose soundtrack to this blaxploitation thriller is a brilliant commentary on the film and its violent world. As the music goes on, the car pulls up in the shadow of the elevated railroad, and a cop takes out a syringe. As the victim pleads for his life, he is injected with a lethal dose of heroin and left to die. We see his face one last time through the window, to the sweet melancholy music. Mayfield appears in the film singing Pusherman, an ironic counterpoise to the story of how a pusher gets out of the business. Mayfield's darkest song and the biggest hit on the soundtrack album, Freddie's Dead, is not in the film, but even so, his bouncy yet sad music gives Superfly a poetic quality that lingers.

Inevitably, Martin becomes obsessed with her, too: the plump, sexy, slatternly Cecilia, who is utterly unintellectual and unreflective, and who makes no secret of another, younger lover - which pushes Martin into an abyss of jealous hatred. There is something a little cliched and misogynistic in the myth of the younger woman as an enigmatic cipher, who functions as an anti-muse to an older, more cerebral man. But Kahn's movie, taken from a novel by Alberto Moravia, moves with assurance and style, and elegantly evokes both the ennui that breeds the affair, and the deeper ennui of desperate futility that ends it.",

The most recent attack was two weeks ago, on two students of Chinese race at Queen's University. Paul Connolly, co-author of the study, said yesterday that Protestants were more likely to express racist views than were Catholics; the difference was small but significant, and increased when the self descriptions unionist and nationalist were applied instead. The study found that, in the abstract, a significant majority held liberal attitudes, with 83% supporting equal opportunities in work and housing, and 87% agreeing children should be taught about minority ethnic cultures. But 25% were unwilling to accept an African-Caribbean, Chinese or south Asian as a neighbour, while 40% would reject anyone from these groups as a close friend. Opposition towards travellers was much higher. The survey said 54% were unwilling to accept a person of south Asian origin as a relative through marriage, compared with 37% in a similar survey four years ago; for Chinese it was 53% compared with 32%. The Chinese community is the largest minority, numbering 8,000; there are 1,400 travellers, 1,200 in the south Asian community, and slightly fewer African-Caribbeans.",

Dublin is also to demand a full explanation from Helen Liddell, the minister of state at the Department of Trade and Industry, of how the company appears to influence the release of information on the nuclear plant. The Irish government's anger grew from the leaking of scores of confidential memorandums to the Channel 4 Dispatches programme and the Guardian, which revealed that BNFL was involved in \"dirty tricks\" operations to mislead and undermine MPs. The documents showed that when Mildred Fox, an independent MP for Wicklow, wrote to Mr Blair asking him to consider the closure of Sellafield her query was passed to the Department of Trade and Industry and then straight to BNFL. A confidential memo from a BNFL manager told the DTI: \"In reply to an Irish MP we believe that it is important to be assertive and not to be appearing to justify or apologise for the UK nuclear industry.\" It went on to say that Ms Fox as \"one of a handful of independent MPs\" did not merit a reply from the prime minister of the trade secretary. BNFL dictated what to say and Mr Battle, then junior energy minister, used most of the information verbatim to reply to Ms Fox. Yesterday Ms Fox - who is furious about the way she has been treated by the British government - met Mr Ahern, who told her he would raise the issue with Mr Blair when he next met him. Mr Ahern told the Guardian in an official statement: \"I am concerned that representations by a member of this house appeared to have been dealt with in this way and intend to ask the energy minister, Joe Jacobs, to raise this issue in the first instance with the British minister for energy, Helen Liddell.\" Privately the Guardian has been told that the Irish government is furious about the cavalier attitude taken by the Department of Trade and Industry in replying to what is regarded as a very sensitive issue in the republic - the pollution of the Irish sea by discharges from the Sellafield plant.

These very first books will be as loved, misused and possibly as chewed as a teddy bear (many of the most popular titles now come in sturdy board versions).</p> <p>Books for this age group need to be simple and bright. That doesn't mean they can't be either poetic or profound, although there are few really great books for the under-threes. There are, however, plenty of highly enjoyable ones. Pick those that you will enjoy reading over and over and over again; children of this age like familiarity and will never tire of the books they love. You, of course, might, so those books with a sly glance in the direction of adult humour are much appreciated.<br> </p> <h2>10 Minutes Till Bedtime by Peggy Rathmann (Puffin, \u00a34.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504122\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2001/03/07/10mins.jpg\" alt=\"10 mins\" width=\"128\" height=\"171\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Ten minutes is a lifetime when you are little and almost anything can happen. It certainly does in this surreal, almost wordless tale in which, as the countdown to bedtime begins, the house is invaded by a busload of hamsters arriving for the bedtime tour. They get everywhere, from the bathroom to bedroom. The great thing about this funny, odd little book is that it is so matter of fact in the way it presents a skewed reality. Neatly bridging the gap between reality and dream worlds, this book may encourage children to make a connection between their dream lives and their waking lives. At the very least, it will make them laugh and help them learn to count backwards from 10. The drawings are like detailed cartoons, busy and full of perceptive little touches that make this as enjoyable for adults as it is for children.</p> <h2>Daisy and the Beastie by Jane Simmons (Orchard, \u00a34.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504123\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2001/03/07/daisy.gif\" alt=\"Daisy and the Beastie\" width=\"128\" height=\"147\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>When Daisy the Duck's grandpa reads her and little Pip a story about the Beastie, Daisy is determined to find the Beastie for herself on their own farm. So it's off to the chickens to see if the Beastie is lurking there, and down to the barn in case the Beastie is with the cows and the sheep. But it turns out there is something nasty in the woodshed. Simmons's vivid picture book knows that it is the beasties you can't see that are the most frightening, and it soothes small fears by revealing the terrible, fearsome beastie to be two playful kittens. Cynical adults will know that this alliance between beak and claw cannot last into adulthood but children fall for this gentle story without fail. Best of all, the pictures have a direct quality that cleverly captures the intensity of the world as experienced through young, not-yet-jaded eyes.</p> <h2>Spot Bakes a Cake by Eric Hill (Puffin, \u00a34.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504124\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2000/10/19/spotbakes2.gif\" alt=\"Spot Bakes a Cake\" width=\"128\" height=\"128\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Originally written for his own small son, Eric Hill's collection of lift-the-flap books never date as they tell of the adventures of the loveable little dog that rates in the nation's consciousness along with the Andrex puppy. But the Andrex puppy can't help you learn to read. The great thing about these big, bold books is that they bear repeated readings and introduce the very young to new situations and experiences such as going to school, going to a party, staying overnight and going to the circus.</p> <h2>Meg and Mog by Helen Nicholl and Jan Pienkowski (Puffin, \u00a34.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504125\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2000/04/14/megandmog.jpg\" alt=\"Meg and Mog\" width=\"128\" height=\"131\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>There remains something very stylish and attractive about these extremely simple books about a witch and her cat that is always getting into scrapes. The text is kept to a minimum and for lots of children it is the few words in these books that become the very first that they read.<br> </p> <h2>The Very Hungry Caterpillar by Eric Carle (Puffin, \u00a34.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504126\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2000/04/14/hungrycaterpillar.gif\" alt=\"Hungry Caterpillar\" width=\"128\" height=\"88\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>It is almost 30 years since Carle's wondrous book first appeared but it is still a marvellous thing, never bettered in the age of the pop-up and the cut-away. The life cycle of the butterfly is recounted in the very simplest terms using bold blocks of colour and minimal language as the caterpillar emerges from the egg and nibbles his way through the pages. This is a colour book, a counting book, a days of the week book and a nature lesson. It is transforming in every sense from the final triumphant emergence of the butterfly to the finger-sized holes in the pages that demand exploration by tiny hands. A book that is quite crucial to happiness.<br> </p> <h2>The Baby's Catalogue by Janet and Alan Ahlberg (Puffin, \u00a34.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504127\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2000/04/14/babyscatalogue.jpg\" alt=\"Baby's Catalogue\" width=\"128\" height=\"125\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The lives of six babies (including a set of twins) living in five different families are dissected under various headings such as Mums and Dads, Baths and Bedtimes, Shopping and Dinners and Accidents (falling down the toilet, feeding your birthday cake to the dog). In effect it is a book of lists, but all the paraphernalia surrounding a small child's life is detailed with wit and affection. For a small child it is like looking in the mirror and seeing a reflection of a life that is both recognisable but also less ordinary. Peepo (Puffin, \u00a34.99) is a variation on these themes set during the last war.</p> <h2>Each Peach Pear Plum by Janet and Allan Ahlberg (Puffin, \u00a34.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504128\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2000/04/14/eachpeach.gif\" alt=\"Each peach\" width=\"128\" height=\"95\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>\"In this book/With your little eye/Take a look/And play I spy...\" A delectable little book with a poem on each page that gives a clue to the characters from a well-known fairytale or nursery rhyme hiding in the picture opposite. Encourages eagle eyes as the stories of Tom Thumb, the Three Bears, Cinderella and others become joined in a seamless thread of nonsense.</p> <h2>We're Going On a Bear Hunt by Michael Rosen and Helen Oxenbury (Walker, \u00a34.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504129\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2000/04/14/bearhunt.jpg\" alt=\"Bear Hunt\" width=\"128\" height=\"103\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>In fact you'll be going on it very frequently once this book joins your library. Rosen's version of the old familiar game has a comic slant as a family set off on a imaginary bear hunt, find a real one and get chased back home. The language is delightful to small mouths, all swishy swashy, squelch squerch and hooo wooo, and the chanting rhythm completely infectious. Oxenbury's lovely watercolours add to the effect. Not just a book for sharing but one for acting out with the whole family.</p> <h2>Where the Wild Things Are by Maurice Sendak (Collins Picture Lions, \u00a35.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504130\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2000/04/14/wherethewildthings.jpg\" alt=\"Where the Wild Things Are\" width=\"128\" height=\"206\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Quite possibly one of the best books ever written. Sendak's story about Max who gets into mischief and is sent to his room and who \"sails through night and day and in and out of weeks and almost over a year to where the wild things are\" is a masterpiece of the subconscious. The anger of the child who longs to eat up the mother who calls him \"a wild thing\" creates the monsters who despite roaring their terrible roars are rather benign figures totally under Max's domination. This is a book about the terrible frightening storm of anger that wells up in the breast of the two-year-old and the warm safety of home and a good hot dinner when \"the wild rumpus\" is finally over. No home with children should be without it.</p> <h2>The Tiger Who Came to Tea by Judith Kerr (Collins, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>Just as Sophie and her mum are settling down to tea, the doorbell rings and an uninvited guest arrives. One of the comic joys of this book is the sang-froid with which Sophie and her mum accept the tiger as if they are perfectly used to having dangerous beasts roaming the kitchen, eating all the food in the fridge and drinking all the water out of the taps. All the better if it means Sophie can't have a bath and the family has to go out for supper in a cafe. A really delightful, friendly book. Just like the tiger.</p> <h2>Can't You Sleep Little Bear? by Martin Waddell and Barbara Firth (Walker, \u00a39.99)</h2> <p>Little Bear is frightened of the dark. At bedtime he can't sleep, not even with the Biggest Lantern of Them All at his bedside. But fortunately Big Bear finds an ingenious way to reassure him. Beautifully written story that dispels all fear of the dark with captivating drawings that display the kind of wit that keep adult interest even after many readings. Well Done, Little Bear in which Little Bear demonstrates all the clever things he can do and falls in the river is the latest in a series that now runs to four books.</p> <h2>Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See by Bill Martin Jr (Puffin, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>Another brilliantly simple book that works on the \"I Spy\" principle as animals in bright colours spot their friends. Good for chanting, learning colours and animals.</p> <h2>The Elephant and the Bad Baby by Elfrida Vipont and Raymond Briggs (Puffin, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>Runner up for the Guardian Award this is a really beautiful little book in which an elephant and a bad baby wreak havoc as they embark on a glorious chase through town.</p> <h2>Dear Zoo by Rod Campbell (Puffin, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>When a small boy writes to the zoo to ask for a pet he isn't offered many suitable candidates. Lift the flap and you'll get a surprise too. Delightful book for the very young.<br> </p> <h2>Strange Bear by Hilary McKay (Hodder, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>Simon is a toddler who loves his teddy bear, Snowtop, whose fur is covered in jam, paint and sand. Mum and Gran are not so keen. So Gran takes him out for the afternoon, and on their return a Strange Bear is waiting for Simon. That night they go on a Snowtop hunt. The story works on two levels, so it is satisfying both for adults which will enjoy the throwaway humour and small children who know the importance of your own special teddy with his own special smell.</p> <h2>Isabel's Noisy Tummy by David McKee (Red Fox, \u00a34.50)</h2> <p>Isabel has a noisy tummy. Nothing can stop it burbling and gurgling. Isabel gets embarrassed and her friends get the giggles. But, on a school visit to the zoo, Isabel's roaring tum saves the day. Very sharp modern drawings combine with tummy humour to make this a winner.</p> <h2>Five Minutes' Peace by Jill Murphy (Walker, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>Mrs Large is desperate for just five minutes to herself. But everywhere she goes in the house the children follow her. Murphy's lovely, witty books about an elephant family show situations recognisable to every child and every mother who has ever wanted her own five minutes of peace.</p> <h2>Spot Goes to School by Eric Hill (Puffin, \u00a33.99)</h2> <p>Engaging series of brightly coloured lift the flap books that tell of the everyday adventures of a small puppy and his menagerie of friends. Very good for early word recognition.</p> <h2>Coming To Tea by Sarah Garland (Puffin, \u00a34.50)</h2> <p>Garland takes familiar events in a toddler's life such as having friends to tea, going swimming or doing the washing and turns them into mini-aga sagas. The humorous illustrations make these good books to share and talk about.</p> <h2>Maisy Goes to Playschool by Lucy Cousins (Walker, \u00a37.99)</h2> <p>One in a best selling series about a loveable little mouse who does all the things a toddler would do. The drawings have a flat, childlike quality that small children find appealing and they love the sturdy pull the tab and lift the flap elements.</p> <h2>Mog and Bunny by Judith Kerr (Collins, \u00a39.99)</h2> <p>Consistently good series of books about a cat called Mog and the family with whom she lives. Everyday tales of family life made special by Kerr's sympathetic storytelling.</p> <h2>Nice Work, Little Wolf by Hilda Offen (Puffin, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>When Little Wolf fell into the Porker's cucumber frame, he was forced to work hard to make up for it. But one day he gets his own back. Smarties award winner that will delight any child who knows that wolves and pigs are one bad combination.</p> <h2>Mr Archimedes' Bath by Pamela Allen (Puffin, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>Science comes easily to tots with this story in which the animals wonder where all the water has come from when Mr Archimedes' bath overflows. Everyone takes turns getting in and out until they discover who is responsible for the mess.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It is never too soon to buy your child's first book. Even the tiniest baby can learn about the world from looking at books and about language from hearing you read. These very first books will be as loved, misused and possibly as chewed as a teddy bear (many of the most popular titles now come in sturdy board versions). Books for this age group need to be simple and bright. That doesn't mean they can't be either poetic or profound, although there are few really great books for the under-threes. There are, however, plenty of highly enjoyable ones. Pick those that you will enjoy reading over and over and over again; children of this age like familiarity and will never tire of the books they love. You, of course, might, so those books with a sly glance in the direction of adult humour are much appreciated. 10 Minutes Till Bedtime by Peggy Rathmann (Puffin, \u00a34.99) Ten minutes is a lifetime when you are little and almost anything can happen. It certainly does in this surreal, almost wordless tale in which, as the countdown to bedtime begins, the house is invaded by a busload of hamsters arriving for the bedtime tour. They get everywhere, from the bathroom to bedroom. The great thing about this funny, odd little book is that it is so matter of fact in the way it presents a skewed reality. Neatly bridging the gap between reality and dream worlds, this book may encourage children to make a connection between their dream lives and their waking lives. At the very least, it will make them laugh and help them learn to count backwards from 10. The drawings are like detailed cartoons, busy and full of perceptive little touches that make this as enjoyable for adults as it is for children. Daisy and the Beastie by Jane Simmons (Orchard, \u00a34.99) When Daisy the Duck's grandpa reads her and little Pip a story about the Beastie, Daisy is determined to find the Beastie for herself on their own farm. So it's off to the chickens to see if the Beastie is lurking there, and down to the barn in case the Beastie is with the cows and the sheep. But it turns out there is something nasty in the woodshed. Simmons's vivid picture book knows that it is the beasties you can't see that are the most frightening, and it soothes small fears by revealing the terrible, fearsome beastie to be two playful kittens. Cynical adults will know that this alliance between beak and claw cannot last into adulthood but children fall for this gentle story without fail. Best of all, the pictures have a direct quality that cleverly captures the intensity of the world as experienced through young, not-yet-jaded eyes. Spot Bakes a Cake by Eric Hill (Puffin, \u00a34.99) Originally written for his own small son, Eric Hill's collection of lift-the-flap books never date as they tell of the adventures of the loveable little dog that rates in the nation's consciousness along with the Andrex puppy.

Spot Goes to School by Eric Hill (Puffin, \u00a33.99) Engaging series of brightly coloured lift the flap books that tell of the everyday adventures of a small puppy and his menagerie of friends. Very good for early word recognition. Coming To Tea by Sarah Garland (Puffin, \u00a34.50) Garland takes familiar events in a toddler's life such as having friends to tea, going swimming or doing the washing and turns them into mini-aga sagas.

Everyday tales of family life made special by Kerr's sympathetic storytelling. Nice Work, Little Wolf by Hilda Offen (Puffin, \u00a34.99) When Little Wolf fell into the Porker's cucumber frame, he was forced to work hard to make up for it. But one day he gets his own back. Smarties award winner that will delight any child who knows that wolves and pigs are one bad combination. Mr Archimedes' Bath by Pamela Allen (Puffin, \u00a34.99) Science comes easily to tots with this story in which the animals wonder where all the water has come from when Mr Archimedes' bath overflows.

      "body": "<p>Leeds United's Uefa Cup semi-final second leg clash against Galatasaray will go ahead at Elland Road next Thursday with no Turkish fans.</p> <p>Uefa announced this morning that all 1,750 away tickets will be withdrawn from sale and declared invalid, but that 80 complimentary tickets will still be given to Galatasaray officials. The club will be able to distribute the tickets to \"persons who, in the opinion of the club will behave in a dignified and restrained manner\" , according to a statement.</p> <p>The announcement was confirmed this morning nine days after the deaths of Christopher Loftus and Kevin Speight following violent clashes in Istanbul ahead of the first leg. European soccer's governing body had spent the last few days weighing up reports from both sides and the West Yorkshire Police before finally backing the plan put forward by Leeds chairman Peter Ridsdale.</p> <p>Ridsdale was pleased with the decision this morning: \"At the end of the day, we have said since the events in Istanbul, it's far better for everybody if we could guarantee there would be no further incidents.</p> <p>\"I think this decision confirms it is easier to manage and we are delighted with the Uefa decision. What we now have to do is get on, organise the game and make sure those people who do come from Galatasaray are afforded the appropriate hospitality.\" </p> <p>Galatasaray chairman Frank Suren reluctantly accepted the decision. \"We will certainly come and play our game, but we want guarantees for our safety and security\", he told BBC Radio Five Live, expressing disappointment that Turkish fans will not be able to travel. \"I cannot accept that the British police will be unable to control 1,700 spectators within the stadium,\" he said.</p> <p>Turkey's sports minister Fikret Unlu was less restrained in his opinions. He told Turkish TV that Uefa had made \"A bad decision. Such a thing cannot be. No doubt [Galatasaray] will win. This victory will show to the whole world that the British attitude is wrong,\" he said.</p> <p>Uefa's statement read: \"The return match in the Uefa Cup semi-final between Leeds United and Galatasaray will go ahead as scheduled.</p> <p>\"The West Yorkshire Police informed Uefa that they would be unable to guarantee the safety of any visiting supporters travelling independently to the match. This report was submitted to the Turkish club who proposed that the match be played behind closed doors or at a neutral venue. This point of view was endorsed by the Turkish Football Association.\"</p> <p>Uefa also insisted that the charges brought against Leeds for failing to control their players during the first leg of the tie were not an attempt to \"persecute\" the club.</p> <p>\"Any club in any of the European club competitions which has four or more players cautioned in a single match is automatically sanctioned for improper conduct of the team\", said the statement. \"This matter, therefore, has no relationship whatsoever with the tragic incidents which took place in Istanbul.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Leeds United's Uefa Cup semi-final second leg clash against Galatasaray will go ahead at Elland Road next Thursday with no Turkish fans. Uefa announced this morning that all 1,750 away tickets will be withdrawn from sale and declared invalid, but that 80 complimentary tickets will still be given to Galatasaray officials. The club will be able to distribute the tickets to \"persons who, in the opinion of the club will behave in a dignified and restrained manner\" , according to a statement. The announcement was confirmed this morning nine days after the deaths of Christopher Loftus and Kevin Speight following violent clashes in Istanbul ahead of the first leg. European soccer's governing body had spent the last few days weighing up reports from both sides and the West Yorkshire Police before finally backing the plan put forward by Leeds chairman Peter Ridsdale. Ridsdale was pleased with the decision this morning: \"At the end of the day, we have said since the events in Istanbul, it's far better for everybody if we could guarantee there would be no further incidents. \"I think this decision confirms it is easier to manage and we are delighted with the Uefa decision. What we now have to do is get on, organise the game and make sure those people who do come from Galatasaray are afforded the appropriate hospitality.\" Galatasaray chairman Frank Suren reluctantly accepted the decision. \"We will certainly come and play our game, but we want guarantees for our safety and security\", he told BBC Radio Five Live, expressing disappointment that Turkish fans will not be able to travel. \"I cannot accept that the British police will be unable to control 1,700 spectators within the stadium,\" he said. Turkey's sports minister Fikret Unlu was less restrained in his opinions. He told Turkish TV that Uefa had made \"A bad decision. Such a thing cannot be. No doubt [Galatasaray] will win. This victory will show to the whole world that the British attitude is wrong,\" he said. Uefa's statement read: \"The return match in the Uefa Cup semi-final between Leeds United and Galatasaray will go ahead as scheduled. \"The West Yorkshire Police informed Uefa that they would be unable to guarantee the safety of any visiting supporters travelling independently to the match. This report was submitted to the Turkish club who proposed that the match be played behind closed doors or at a neutral venue. This point of view was endorsed by the Turkish Football Association.\" Uefa also insisted that the charges brought against Leeds for failing to control their players during the first leg of the tie were not an attempt to \"persecute\" the club. \"Any club in any of the European club competitions which has four or more players cautioned in a single match is automatically sanctioned for improper conduct of the team\", said the statement. \"This matter, therefore, has no relationship whatsoever with the tragic incidents which took place in Istanbul.\"",

      "body": "<p>Uefa has decided that the return match in the Uefa Cup semi-final between Leeds United AFC and Galatasaray SK will go ahead as scheduled. The match will be played at Elland Road on 20 April 2000 at 20.00 hours BST. </p> <p>This decision was taken by the Bureau of the Committee for Uefa Club Competitions at a meeting chaired by Jean Fournet-Fayard of France, based on reports submitted by the official Uefa Delegate at the first leg in Istanbul and the Uefa security officer, followed up by a review of the situation by the Uefa Stadia Committee, statements received from both clubs and a report from the West Yorkshire Police. </p> <p>On 11 April 2000, the West Yorkshire Police informed Uefa that they would be unable to guarantee the safety of any visiting supporters travelling independently to the match. This report was submitted to the Turkish club who proposed that the match be played behind closed doors or at a neutral venue. This point of view was endorsed by the Turkish Football Association. </p> <p>In reaching its conclusion, Uefa was aware that the decision would not meet unanimous approval but decided to cancel the sale of tickets to Turkish supporters. </p> <p>This means that the 1,750 purchase tickets allocated to Galatasaray SK for the match at Elland Road are declared invalid and must be returned immediately to Uefa. These tickets will be retained by Uefa and the areas to the stadium to which they relate will, in principle, remain empty. </p> <p>However, the 80 complimentary tickets allocated to Galatasaray SK may be distributed by the Turkish team to persons who, in the opinion of the club, will behave in a dignified and restrained manner. They, along with directors, players, staff and media representatives, will be regarded as Galatasaray SK's official party.</p> <p>Leeds United AFC will be instructed to ensure that the local police authorities do everything possible to guarantee the safety of the Galatasaray SK official party from the moment of their arrival in England until their departure. </p> <p>In addition, Leeds United AFC have been instructed to ensure that supporters will be screened on entry to the stadium in order to prevent any 'independent' Turkish supporters from being admitted to areas occupied by Leeds United AFC fans. Any such persons in possession of a valid ticket will be escorted to the area initially reserved for the 1,750 Turkish fans. </p> <p>Subject to the wishes of Leeds United AFC and subject to approval by the security authorities, Uefa has proposed that both teams and the match officials will wear black armbands during the match and that the game will be preceded by a period of silence. </p> <p>The decision, which is final and binding, is designed to guarantee the safety of all participants and spectators. Uefa also wishes to emphasise that Galatasaray SK are not responsible for the tragic deaths of two Leeds United AFC supporters in the streets of Istanbul and that the match in Istanbul was played without any incidents. Leeds United AFC have also expressed their satisfaction at being treated properly and respectfully by Galatasaray SK and will do everything in their power to ensure that representatives of the Turkish club are treated with the same respect in Leeds. </p> <p>As a result of the tragic incidents in Istanbul, there has been a great deal of public comment, some of it emanating from representatives of both clubs, which has been of a partisan and inflammatory nature hardly conducive to calming a volatile situation. </p> <p>It has even been suggested that Uefa is persecuting Leeds United AFC because the English club has received notification that it is liable to a fine for improper conduct of the team during the first leg match in Istanbul. </p> <p>Uefa wishes to stress that any club in any of the European club competitions which has four or more players cautioned in a single match is automatically sanctioned for improper conduct of the team. This matter, therefore, has no relationship whatsoever with the tragic incidents which took place in Istanbul. </p> <p>Uefa requests that all parties concerned, including the media, out of respect for the lives that have been lost, should refrain from making any further controversial statements and should concentrate instead on ensuring that the second-leg match is played in an atmosphere of peace and safety.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Uefa has decided that the return match in the Uefa Cup semi-final between Leeds United AFC and Galatasaray SK will go ahead as scheduled. The match will be played at Elland Road on 20 April 2000 at 20.00 hours BST. This decision was taken by the Bureau of the Committee for Uefa Club Competitions at a meeting chaired by Jean Fournet-Fayard of France, based on reports submitted by the official Uefa Delegate at the first leg in Istanbul and the Uefa security officer, followed up by a review of the situation by the Uefa Stadia Committee, statements received from both clubs and a report from the West Yorkshire Police. On 11 April 2000, the West Yorkshire Police informed Uefa that they would be unable to guarantee the safety of any visiting supporters travelling independently to the match. This report was submitted to the Turkish club who proposed that the match be played behind closed doors or at a neutral venue. This point of view was endorsed by the Turkish Football Association. In reaching its conclusion, Uefa was aware that the decision would not meet unanimous approval but decided to cancel the sale of tickets to Turkish supporters. This means that the 1,750 purchase tickets allocated to Galatasaray SK for the match at Elland Road are declared invalid and must be returned immediately to Uefa. These tickets will be retained by Uefa and the areas to the stadium to which they relate will, in principle, remain empty. However, the 80 complimentary tickets allocated to Galatasaray SK may be distributed by the Turkish team to persons who, in the opinion of the club, will behave in a dignified and restrained manner. They, along with directors, players, staff and media representatives, will be regarded as Galatasaray SK's official party. Leeds United AFC will be instructed to ensure that the local police authorities do everything possible to guarantee the safety of the Galatasaray SK official party from the moment of their arrival in England until their departure. In addition, Leeds United AFC have been instructed to ensure that supporters will be screened on entry to the stadium in order to prevent any 'independent' Turkish supporters from being admitted to areas occupied by Leeds United AFC fans. Any such persons in possession of a valid ticket will be escorted to the area initially reserved for the 1,750 Turkish fans. Subject to the wishes of Leeds United AFC and subject to approval by the security authorities, Uefa has proposed that both teams and the match officials will wear black armbands during the match and that the game will be preceded by a period of silence. The decision, which is final and binding, is designed to guarantee the safety of all participants and spectators. Uefa also wishes to emphasise that Galatasaray SK are not responsible for the tragic deaths of two Leeds United AFC supporters in the streets of Istanbul and that the match in Istanbul was played without any incidents. Leeds United AFC have also expressed their satisfaction at being treated properly and respectfully by Galatasaray SK and will do everything in their power to ensure that representatives of the Turkish club are treated with the same respect in Leeds. As a result of the tragic incidents in Istanbul, there has been a great deal of public comment, some of it emanating from representatives of both clubs, which has been of a partisan and inflammatory nature hardly conducive to calming a volatile situation. It has even been suggested that Uefa is persecuting Leeds United AFC because the English club has received notification that it is liable to a fine for improper conduct of the team during the first leg match in Istanbul. Uefa wishes to stress that any club in any of the European club competitions which has four or more players cautioned in a single match is automatically sanctioned for improper conduct of the team. This matter, therefore, has no relationship whatsoever with the tragic incidents which took place in Istanbul. Uefa requests that all parties concerned, including the media, out of respect for the lives that have been lost, should refrain from making any further controversial statements and should concentrate instead on ensuring that the second-leg match is played in an atmosphere of peace and safety.",

Yet just two weeks later, creative director Gilles Dufour was sacked by the fashion house's management. For although the show had been widely viewed as a success, in the eyes of the august fashion house it had categorically failed. Failed, that is, to be true to the spirit of Balmain. </p> <p>The problems at Balmain have highlighted an increasing tension in the fashion industry.

But not every transition has gone quite so smoothly as these. Already this year the fashion world has witnessed some clumsy upheavals.

Elbaz announced his resignation last February. </p> <p>More embarrassing was the case of John Bartlett at Byblos. Bartlett's relationship with Byblos's management had been fractious throughout his three years as creative consultant, and things came to a head this winter when Bartlett staged a form of fashion rebellion, allegedly telling US fashion editors not to bother going to the Byblos show that year. </p> <p>So what is more important - the identity of the fashion house or the creative expression of the designer? And how much freedom should the designer have within the fashion house? </p> <p>Fuzzy statements released by fashion houses when new designers are appointed emphasise the sense of confusion. Kenzo Takada's hopes for Rosier, for example, are typically vague and contradictory: \"I'm sure he'll be able to renew the line while respecting our style.\" </p> <p>Yet despite their anxiety, fashion houses know that modernisation is necessary for survival, as Ford demonstrated when he resuscitated the Gucci label 10 years ago. The difficulty is balancing new trends with the tradition of the fashion house. </p> <p>An incoming designer has to decide what the brand name represents (such as the Ab Fab-ness of Lacroix, or the Parisian chic of Yves Saint Laurent) and ensure that his or her designs accord with that image. </p> <p>This season's trend of \"logomania\" - in which items of clothing and accessories are speckled with G's, CD's and YSL's - could be seen as a reminder to the public of the brand name's cachet. As Dufour says: \"When I designed at Balmain, I designed Balmain. I did not design Gilles Dufour. The general look was dictated by the management, but I did have creative freedom with the clothes.\" </p> <p>Victoire de Castallaine, designer of the haute couture jewellery at Dior, says that other designers are even more constrained: \"Some in the past have been told they have to sacrifice their ideas. Absolutely.\" </p> <p>Of course, the ideal situation for a designer is to work for a fashion house as well as his or her own line, such as John Galliano, design director of Dior and of his own label. The designer then has financial and creative freedom. </p> <p>Alexander McQueen sums it up: \"If you want a starving Ethiopian on a jacket, come to McQueen. If you want luxury, come to Givenchy. I can do both.\" Although after Givenchy's autumn/winter 2000 show, which featured a luxe take on punk, some fashion insiders were wondering if London's most outrageous designer had gone too far in re-inventing Givenchy. </p> <p>Total creative freedom doesn't always yield delights. For Dior's autumn/winter show, Galliano produced an imaginative collection heavily influenced by hip hop (frayed denim, shiny leather, outsized gold jewellery) and it divided the fashion world over its suitability for the venerable house of Dior. </p> <p>When Yves Saint Laurent took over as creative director at Dior 40 years ago, his first col lection was a shocking departure from the classical style established by his predecessor - sexier, and now hailed as a work of genius. Inevitably, it did scandalise some Dior devotees, but Saint Laurent kept his job. Pretty soon, though, he craved total freedom and left to create his own label. </p> <p>Ironically, former Byblos designers Keith Varty and Alan Cleaver thought they had found the ideal freedom at the Milan design company. \"A company like Byblos doesn't exist in England,\" they enthused in 1990. \"In Italy, designers are treated like pop stars.\" They were fired in 1995. </p> <p>Even more ironically, Dufour and Elbaz had both been successful at Balmain and Yves Saint Laurent. Within three seasons, Dufour rejuvenated a label that had all but fallen into obscurity, making it the darling of young Hollywood and chic Parisiennes. And yet he found himself ousted after alleged management displeasure over two vest tops in Balmain's show emblazoned with the words \"Whore\" and \"Bitch\". </p> <p>Dufour has launched a lawsuit against his former employers. </p> <p>Elbaz's collections had been highly praised for their com- bination of YSL classicism with touches of moder nity. Yet even such success was not enough to withstand the incoming might of the Gucci group and polymath Ford. Unsurprisingly, both Dufour and Elbaz are said to be considering starting up their own labels. </p> <p>According to fashion writer Linda Watson, Tom Ford at Gucci and Karl Lagerfeld at Fendi and Chanel have succeeded because they have taken \"established labels and given them modern twists\". But the truth is simply that these two designers are powerful enough (their own names are as famous as the labels they design) to have the freedom to experiment without fear of being sacked. </p> <p>It is smaller designers such as Dufour and Bartlett who are at risk from nervous financial backers and over-protective management boards. Moreover, some fashion houses, such as Balmain, foster an image of conservatism, yet still want to attract a new generation of consumers. Dufour says this paradox is most apparent at the fashion shows. \"British designers, especially McQueen and Galliano, exemplify this, as they show their clothes in a provocative way. You want to get them noticed. But they must be wearable, and go [with the label's image]. Also, they [financial backers] have to learn that it always takes at least three seasons for a line to make any money.\" </p> <p>Despite the fate of Dufour, Elbaz and Bartlett, Rosier is optimistic about Kenzo. \"I will work with lots of colours and prints,\" he has said, \"but in my own way. I'd like people to say about my collection that it's new and different - but still Kenzo.\" </p> <p>Dufour, however, offers Rosier some more concrete advice. \"Be free, be creative... but have guts.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>I must have got him on a good day, because he came back and the answer was yes. After years of asking and years of nononono, it was suddenly yes. Yes, he would agree to... well, let's not call it an interview, but anyway an... informal chat. On the record. Maybe over coffee. But (this was being relayed by the curator of the Saatchi gallery, Jenny Blyth) he wanted to keep it fun and, you know, light. Fun. But yes! </p> <p>In fact I know I got him on a good day because it was a day Charles had gone to look at a new toy. With the New York dealer Larry Gagosian, who Saatchi has long used to \"disperse\" works from the collection that he has blown cool on, or judged are right for the market at that moment, he had been Rollered down to the West Country to cast a hungry eye over Damien Hirst's first new work for many years, at his studio near Stroud. A day out shopping. So he was up. </p> <p>But he had been down, a friend had told me - dragged low by the reaction to the Sensation show - \"Young British Artists from the Saatchi Collection\" - towards the end of last year in New York. Instead of being a celebration of his collecting acumen and confirmation of his \"modern Medici\" status, it had all been elephant dung and city politics and the showboating of Mayor Giuliani instead. \"He was very high in New York,\" the friend said. \"He went in to install the show every day. And he was very pleased. But then it didn't go the way he expected at all.\" </p> <p>Plus, in London the New Neurotic Realism debacle had reportedly got him into a bit of a grump. Neurotic Realism. The last big art movement. Remember it? No? That's OK. Nobody else does either. It was a synthetic attempt at having lightning strike twice. To hurry things on. Didn't work. Saatchi himself was rumoured to have found the NNR book he put out, with its tawdry cover and vapid boostering of a new \"tinsel-camp aesthetic\", a misjudgment and an embarrassment; evidence that perhaps it isn't so easy to engineer change - to invent the history of British art before it has happened. </p> <p>So he had been down. But the day I called there was a song in his heart and a spring in his step and he was up. Almost every major talent attracts at least one or two important collectors at an early stage in his or her career. And, to his credit, Saatchi has supported Damien Hirst and a handful of that generation of artists almost from day one. He bought A Thousand Years in 1990 from a Hirst-curated show called Gambler. With its maggots and flies and rotting cow's head, and the attendant, almost impossible, problems of storage and installation, it was a work that almost every other collector in the world would have shied away from. </p> <p>A year later, he paid for the trapping, transportation and preservation of the now-notorious tiger shark and then used his \"top ad-man\" abilities to turn it into a weirdly potent symbol of the age. Pictures of the shark were reproduced with a frequency which invested it with considerable power as an image and deepened its mystery: silent, immobile, latently lethal, suspended for eternity in its secure vitrine, it became a kind of logo of the times; a blank and yet peculiarly charged emblem. </p> <p>Saatchi says that he believes a thumbnail history of the art of the last half-century would go: Jackson Pollock - Andy Warhol - Damien Hirst. His belief in Hirst's talent - Saatchi has been known to call it his \"genius\" - has never been in question. He has always been prepared to get his chequebook out for Damien. And on the day I phoned him he had apparently been in a quandary over which of nearly two-dozen pieces to stump up for first. He left Stroud at around four in the afternoon and was apparently still enthusing over the new work with Larry Gagosian at one o'clock the following morning. </p> <p>So he was up. He had had the pick of some important new work by his favourite living artist and he had come good. Hymn, the 20ft, 10-ton bronze cast of an anatomical children's toy that he had bought for \u00a31m, was already on its way to the Saatchi gallery in north London, trailed by a TV documentary team. The interview was on. But then he seemed to be down. </p> <p>Supercollector, a book which billed itself as \"a hostile critique written from a socialist standpoint\", authored by two British academics, was published in mid-March. \"A new book came out yesterday,\" the Bond Street dealer Bernard Jacobson told me. \"Charles must be feeling very hurt.\" Jacobson and Saatchi went to school together; they have remained lifelong friends. \"They've tried to make him look ugly on the cover, and he's not ugly. A horrible picture. Charles is a good-looking guy. They've tried to make him look Jewish .\" </p> <p>The next day Jenny Blyth called from the Saatchi gallery. Our \"informal chat\" had been set up for March 24, a Friday. I could tell from her voice that there was a problem. \"This is embarrassing. I'm not backtracking. But I seem to have misunderstood. Charles doesn't want to do the chat walking around the show. Um, or over coffee. Oh this is all my fault. I said it would be just coffee, but he said it would be like an interview. Charles doesn't do interviews. What he wonders is, could you let him have your questions by fax, and he'll fax you back his replies. It's not very satisfactory, I know. But if you could do that to start with, I'll try and warm it up a bit later.\" </p> <p>A few days later Jenny Blyth called again. She was pitching the idea of writing about some \"post-YBAs\" who had been taken into the collection - some Neurotic Realist artists, in fact. I said I was planning to write about some post-YBAs who weren't in the collection. One of these was Richard Woods, whose new show I'd seen the night before. \"Oh we like Richard Woods,\" Jenny said. \"We've been watching him for a long time. I'll tell Charles to get down there.\" </p> <p>Tuesday March 21: I call Jenny with a suggestion. What if I delivered the Q and As by hand? Just handed them over to Charles, with no attempt to speak to him or accost him? Jenny: \"I don't think that's a good idea. I think that would really irritate him. I think it really would. No, Q and A is the way to go. And then if he likes them, the chances are he would just chill.\" </p> <p>It is well known that Saatchi never attends his own openings. Some employees worked for his ad agency for years without meeting him. An often repeated anecdote describes Saatchi pretending to be an office cleaner rather than meet clients touring the building. Everything he does that isn't directly centred on his collection (and a lot of what is) revolves around concealment, seclusion, ways of evasion. He seems to be convinced that serious trackers are moving in with their mobile phones and zoom lenses. It's an irrational way of life that has a powerful inner logic. This involves investment in himself as an enigmatic Svengali figure and creating value in the works of art in his collection. </p> <p>He was able to bring himself to the teetering edge of the interview ordeal, it seems, only as a way of promoting Ant Noises (it's an anagram of Sensation) the show of post-Sensation work by YBA artists which opens at the Saatchi gallery next week. </p> <p>His brother, Maurice, once joked that Saatchi was an acronym for \"Simple And Arresting Truths Create High Impact\". If there is a recurring factor in Charles Saatchi's collecting, then it is surely an attraction to art with high visual impact and shock value - what Bernard Jacobson once described as \"soundbite art\". And the bite about the \u00a31m bronze that was Saatchi's latest acquisition - that it was copied from a \u00a314.99 Humbrol plastic toy - was soon planted safely in the papers. A full-page story appeared in the Sunday Times almost within hours of Hirst's \"big guy\" arriving by transporter at the Saatchi gallery. More importantly, the story was accompanied by a large colour picture of the sculpture which, with the wind in the right direction and the full apparatus of publicity and promotion behind it, was about to begin the crossover to icon status. \"Every photograph,\" as Don DeLillo writes in one of his novels, nodding towards Walter Benjamin, \"reinforces the aura . . . An accumulation of nameless energies.\" </p> <p>Much of Hymn's aura at this point resides in the (much reported) price. One million pounds. The magic six noughts. Hirst himself seems to have realised this when Saatchi at one point seemed to be sticking at \u00a3950,000 and he insisted on holding out for what he believed was the right amount. \"I said to my accountant, Frank: 'Don't forget you can buy a three-bedroom house where I grew up in Leeds for \u00a353,500. It's almost an insult to go 50,000 short of it.'\" </p> <p>Unlike many artists, Hirst is unembarrassed about the money element in his work. In the past he has talked about liking the fact that the work becomes a commodity when it leaves the studio; that it is part of its life in the world. In one of the new sculptures, From the Cradle to the Grave, a Coutts gold card signed \"Damien Hirst\" balances on its edge on the surface of a desk. \"Whereas art and science and religion you can just about get your mind round,\" he says, \"money you can't. People can tell you what things are worth, but it's not what they're worth. Money seems to skitter through everything and be ungraspable.\" </p> <p>Recently, he says, he felt peculiarly wounded when he thought Charles Saatchi had volunteered to deposit half a million pounds (\"Pounds, Charles - pounds\") in the bank to secure the big bronze man, a sculpure that, as far as Hirst was concerned, Saatchi had never seen. \"I couldn't believe you would do that. I hated the idea that he would buy something sight unseen. Because you make visual art. And for him to do that would mean that it was nothing to do with that. It was all to do with gambling. I thought it was all market concerns. I was quite relieved to find out that he'd seen a polaroid of it. Basically, he was behaving like a man who'd seen it, and he had seen it. Somebody had slipped him a picture.\" </p> <p>Richard Wentworth taught Hirst and a number of his contemporaries at Goldsmiths College. He is an acutely perceptive commentator on, as well as a wised-up consumer of, popular culture. And Wentworth believes it is significant that Charles Saatchi's latest fetish object started life as a child's plastic toy. \"The joke is that the piece has got aura because Charles cherished the desire to own. If you could ask a five-year-old they could tell you. I guess the message we take away from this is: Charles must have his toys.\"</p>",

Some employees worked for his ad agency for years without meeting him. An often repeated anecdote describes Saatchi pretending to be an office cleaner rather than meet clients touring the building. Everything he does that isn't directly centred on his collection (and a lot of what is) revolves around concealment, seclusion, ways of evasion. He seems to be convinced that serious trackers are moving in with their mobile phones and zoom lenses. It's an irrational way of life that has a powerful inner logic. This involves investment in himself as an enigmatic Svengali figure and creating value in the works of art in his collection. He was able to bring himself to the teetering edge of the interview ordeal, it seems, only as a way of promoting Ant Noises (it's an anagram of Sensation) the show of post-Sensation work by YBA artists which opens at the Saatchi gallery next week. His brother, Maurice, once joked that Saatchi was an acronym for \"Simple And Arresting Truths Create High Impact\". If there is a recurring factor in Charles Saatchi's collecting, then it is surely an attraction to art with high visual impact and shock value - what Bernard Jacobson once described as \"soundbite art\". And the bite about the \u00a31m bronze that was Saatchi's latest acquisition - that it was copied from a \u00a314.99 Humbrol plastic toy - was soon planted safely in the papers. A full-page story appeared in the Sunday Times almost within hours of Hirst's \"big guy\" arriving by transporter at the Saatchi gallery. More importantly, the story was accompanied by a large colour picture of the sculpture which, with the wind in the right direction and the full apparatus of publicity and promotion behind it, was about to begin the crossover to icon status. \"Every photograph,\" as Don DeLillo writes in one of his novels, nodding towards Walter Benjamin, \"reinforces the aura . . . An accumulation of nameless energies.\" Much of Hymn's aura at this point resides in the (much reported) price. One million pounds. The magic six noughts. Hirst himself seems to have realised this when Saatchi at one point seemed to be sticking at \u00a3950,000 and he insisted on holding out for what he believed was the right amount. \"I said to my accountant, Frank: 'Don't forget you can buy a three-bedroom house where I grew up in Leeds for \u00a353,500. It's almost an insult to go 50,000 short of it.'\" Unlike many artists, Hirst is unembarrassed about the money element in his work. In the past he has talked about liking the fact that the work becomes a commodity when it leaves the studio; that it is part of its life in the world. In one of the new sculptures, From the Cradle to the Grave, a Coutts gold card signed \"Damien Hirst\" balances on its edge on the surface of a desk. \"Whereas art and science and religion you can just about get your mind round,\" he says, \"money you can't. People can tell you what things are worth, but it's not what they're worth. Money seems to skitter through everything and be ungraspable.\" Recently, he says, he felt peculiarly wounded when he thought Charles Saatchi had volunteered to deposit half a million pounds (\"Pounds, Charles - pounds\") in the bank to secure the big bronze man, a sculpure that, as far as Hirst was concerned, Saatchi had never seen. \"I couldn't believe you would do that. I hated the idea that he would buy something sight unseen. Because you make visual art. And for him to do that would mean that it was nothing to do with that. It was all to do with gambling. I thought it was all market concerns. I was quite relieved to find out that he'd seen a polaroid of it. Basically, he was behaving like a man who'd seen it, and he had seen it. Somebody had slipped him a picture.\" Richard Wentworth taught Hirst and a number of his contemporaries at Goldsmiths College. He is an acutely perceptive commentator on, as well as a wised-up consumer of, popular culture. And Wentworth believes it is significant that Charles Saatchi's latest fetish object started life as a child's plastic toy. \"The joke is that the piece has got aura because Charles cherished the desire to own. If you could ask a five-year-old they could tell you. I guess the message we take away from this is: Charles must have his toys.\"",

If she succeeds in reuniting Elian with his father Juan Miguel without violence breaking out, it will be a huge achievement. But if she cannot draw the sting of the case which has convulsed Florida ever since Elian was rescued and sent to live with his Miami relatives last November, it could be a disaster, personally and politically.</p> <p>One clear sign of the high stakes involved is that Ms Reno, who has sometimes driven colleagues to distraction with her unwillingness to delegate, has off-loaded many of her other responsibilities to subordinates as the Elian case has continued.</p> <p>She has spent days on nothing but the Gonzalez family battle.</p> <p>Some observers say that she has loosened up in the process. Certainly, she has seemed to become more expansive in her remarks on the case as it has continued.</p> <p>In the past, Janet Reno press conferences were deadpan, minimalist events in which the attorney general appeared to tease reporters by saying as little as possible in as undramatic a way as possible - even when she was announcing a major development in a story which was front page news.</p> <p>She told colleagues this week that she was deeply moved by her meeting with Juan Miguel Gonzalez, the boy's father, and that she believed that she was right to insist that the law must be enforced and that Elian should be returned to his father.</p> <p>If that happens, then the long years of mockery of America's first woman attorney general will look even more undeserved than they do already.</p> <p>If it does not, Ms Reno's enemies - who have never forgiven her for her decision to authorise the teargas attack which ended the Waco siege in 1993 - will hound her more ruthlessly than ever until she leaves office next January to return to Miami.</p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.libertyforelian.org/\" target=\"_new\">Campaign to keep Elian in US</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.pathtofreedom.com/\" target=\"_new\">Let Elian go home</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.cubanet.org/\" target=\"_new\">Cubanet</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/www/regions/wha/cuba/index.html\" target=\"_new\">Department of State: The US and Cuba</a><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Janet Reno's decision to fly to her home town of Miami to try to resolve the Elian Gonzalez crisis shows the extent to which the family dispute over the custody of a six-year-old boy has become the defining moment in the US attorney general's turbulent career. It sometimes seems that much of the American media - and almost all congressional Republicans - do not have a good word to say about Ms Reno, 62, who took office in 1993 and is the longest-serving US attorney general since the late Robert Kennedy. But if she solves this crisis gracefully, without incurring the blame for the inevitable turmoil of the final days of the Elian custody battle, Ms Reno may have the last word. Throughout her headline-grabbing career as head of the justice department, she has rarely appeared to be put off her stride by events such as the siege at Waco, Texas, the Monica Lewinsky affair and the Microsoft monopoly. Nor has she appeared fazed by pressure from people as powerful as Bill Clinton, Bill Gates and Kenneth Starr or groups such as Miami's Cuban exile population. Ms Reno is probably better qualified to handle the conflicting pressures of the Gonzalez case than any of her predecessors or her colleagues at the head of US law enforcement. As a prosecutor with a background in children's law, who spent all of her earlier career in Miami, Ms Reno is steeped in the tempestuous politics of southern Florida, and is well aware of the power of the Cuban exile community. Associates said that she made the trip to Florida this week because she felt comfortable in the high octane politics of Miami, a city which she praised again yesterday. But she went south for legal and political reasons as well - to show for the record that she had taken every possible step to resolve the Elian dispute peacefully. Ms Reno needs to prove that she has taken all reasonable steps before a decision can be taken to send in federal officers to enforce the law. If the Elian case goes to appeal, or if there is a high-level post mortem on its denouement, Ms Reno has her own defence prepared well in advance. Nevertheless, the trip to Miami is an enormous gamble. If she succeeds in reuniting Elian with his father Juan Miguel without violence breaking out, it will be a huge achievement. But if she cannot draw the sting of the case which has convulsed Florida ever since Elian was rescued and sent to live with his Miami relatives last November, it could be a disaster, personally and politically. One clear sign of the high stakes involved is that Ms Reno, who has sometimes driven colleagues to distraction with her unwillingness to delegate, has off-loaded many of her other responsibilities to subordinates as the Elian case has continued. She has spent days on nothing but the Gonzalez family battle. Some observers say that she has loosened up in the process. Certainly, she has seemed to become more expansive in her remarks on the case as it has continued. In the past, Janet Reno press conferences were deadpan, minimalist events in which the attorney general appeared to tease reporters by saying as little as possible in as undramatic a way as possible - even when she was announcing a major development in a story which was front page news. She told colleagues this week that she was deeply moved by her meeting with Juan Miguel Gonzalez, the boy's father, and that she believed that she was right to insist that the law must be enforced and that Elian should be returned to his father. If that happens, then the long years of mockery of America's first woman attorney general will look even more undeserved than they do already. If it does not, Ms Reno's enemies - who have never forgiven her for her decision to authorise the teargas attack which ended the Waco siege in 1993 - will hound her more ruthlessly than ever until she leaves office next January to return to Miami.

Mr Zenawi rowed back from earlier Ethiopian criticism of governments being slow to deliver the grain they had promised. The statment seemed to mark a truce in the war of words with the international community, which has demanded an end to the war with Eritrea as a condition for increasing long-term aid.</p> <p>Mr Zenawi said he was pleased with his discussions with Ms Bertini and announced what he called a new chapter in relations \"when humanitarian issues are separated from political issues\".</p> <p>The Ethiopian government has requested 800,000 tonnes of aid.

      "bodyText": "The spectre of mass starvation in Ethiopia is receding now that foreign governments have promised enough grain to feed the estimated 8m people at risk, the prime minister, Meles Zenawi, declared yesterday. His surprisingly optimistic statement came after meeting Catherine Bertini, the UN's special envoy to the region. Mr Zenawi rowed back from earlier Ethiopian criticism of governments being slow to deliver the grain they had promised. The statment seemed to mark a truce in the war of words with the international community, which has demanded an end to the war with Eritrea as a condition for increasing long-term aid. Mr Zenawi said he was pleased with his discussions with Ms Bertini and announced what he called a new chapter in relations \"when humanitarian issues are separated from political issues\". The Ethiopian government has requested 800,000 tonnes of aid. The European Union recently pledged 430,000 tonnes for this year, of which Britain will provide about 17%. The 20,000 tonnes in direct British aid, already pledged on top of its EU commitment, makes London one of the largest single donors, at an estimated cost of \u00a325m. Ethiopia claims to be the victim of aggression in the border war with its former ally and friend, which western analysts in Ethiopia estimate is costing Ethiopia more than \u00a3600,000 a day. Given that the war has been raging for the past two years, that would put the cost of the war to date at \u00a3500m. Many observers feel this is an unacceptable price for any government to pay when the lives of millions of its citizens are at stake, but Mr Zenawi said: \"We do not believe that protecting one's sovereignty is a luxury for the rich alone.\" Meanwhile, new research shows that the majority of Ethiopian households have difficulty maintaining adequate nutrition even when there is no famine. Interviews with 140 families conducted by Oxfam last year found that they spent more than 90% of their income on food, and that more than two-thirds owned no livestock or only a tiny plot of land. Over-population in the northern highlands means that people are farming smaller and smaller plots and moving to less fertile land on steep hillsides. Many families produce only enough grain to feed themselves for three or four months a year, and it takes only one or two harvests to fail to push millions to the brink of starvation. Life expectancy in Ethiopia is 43 years. Oxfam says that unless the outside world increases its development aid the cycle of crisis and poverty will not be broken.

As the Diary disclosed last week, the West Midlands party has claimed Raghib's nomination from his Perry Barr constituency was invalid because the meeting which nominated him was inquorate. But Bill Challis, secretary of the Perry Barr party, says that is \"bollocks\". The local party then sat on Raghib's forms (which had to be submitted by last Friday), so he filled out another set, which Bill himself took to Millbank Tower the day before nominations closed. But just handing in the forms turned out to be a trial: \"It was like a secret police grilling,\" says Bill, who was confronted by party apparatchiks. \"I expected a rubber truncheon at any minute.\" The party is sticking to its \"inquorate\" line, so Raghib is using lawyers, with the threat of an injunction that could halt the NEC elections due at the end of the month.</p> <p>\u0095 Wee fibs are another thing that New Labour also can't seem to resist. A member who wrote to resign over the London mayoral nomination received a fascinating reply from the general secretary, Margaret McDonagh, denying the process was rigged to help poor old Dobbo. \"The media do not always present the facts with complete accuracy,\" wrote Madonna (in a blatant and transparent jibe at the Diary). \"Frank Dobson was selected by an electoral college, just as Neil Kinnock, John Smith, Tony Blair and John Prescott were.\" Yes, but they were all different in their own special ways - just like the electoral college that so successfully elected Alun Michael as Labour's leader in Wales, but Maggie seem to have forgotten that one.</p> <p>\u0095 Poor Martha Lane-Fox.

      "bodyText": "The driver at the centre of the Paddington rail disaster may have passed a \"false\" green signal caused by a track fault, an official report by the railway inspectorate declares today. Doubts about whether the inexperienced driver, Michael Hodder, could be blamed for the crash are raised in the third interim report of the heath and safety executive into last October's crash in which 31 people, including both train drivers, died. It says that railway inspectors have found a track joint \"with significant misalignment\" between the rails near signal 109, which has since been taken out of commission by Railtrack. The report says further work is in progress to assess whether there is any possibility \"however remote\" that Hodder's train passed over the track joint, causing a vibration of the automatic warning system (AWS) magnet near SN 109. This could have caused a \"mal-operation\" which could have led to Mr Hodder receiving \"a false green signal ahead indication\" as he approached SN 109. The AWS system was on board the Thames Train operated by Mr Hodder, who had only qualified as a driver 13 days before his train collided with a Great Western express. Railtrack's chief executive, Gerald Corbett, said that it had only just been informed of the theoretical possibility that the AWS system was not working properly and had not so far been provided with any scientific report to support the HSE's theory. He pointed out that AWS had been in use for decades. \"Had the railway inspectorate considered this was a major railway problem, no doubt it would have informed us well before now.\" Rob Gifford, secretary of the parliamentary advisory committee on transport safety, said: \"Going for driver error may seem like an easy answer, but the true situation is far more complex.\" The railway inspectorate, which has submitted the report to Lord Cullen in preparation for his public inquiry into the Paddington crash on May 10, is also examining a theory that the AWS equipment on the Thames train was loose, potentially a more serious problem than misalignment of the track joint. Unpublished evidence collected by the HSE suggests Mr Hodder was travelling at 40mph by the time he passed SN 109. If so, he could not have stopped in time to avoid hitting the high speed express. There is no evidence that Mr Hodder was distracted at the time of the accident. He passed his drivers' rules examination last April and was assessed competent to drive at the end of May. Before the accident, he had completed nine shifts as driver in charge. The report draws attention to the \"unusual design\" of SN 109. Before the crash Railtrack held several meetings following complaints about the signal, but the issues had not been resolved. The inspectorate is examining other factors, such as low bridges, the design and positioning of overhead electrification equipment, and the curve of the track outside Paddington. Investigators have painstakingly reconstructed a carriage from 18 wagon loads of wreckage, and reconstructed a fire to determine why coach H at the front of the Great Western train was so severely burnt. Work is being carried out to link the deaths and serious injuries against structural damage in each of the coaches. Mr Corbett said the HSE report reaffirmed that the signals were not at fault, and the height of SN 109 conformed with requirements. The investigation into this \"tragic accident\" was far from complete, he said, and it would be \"quite wrong\" to pre-empt Lord Cullen's inquiry.",

      "body": "<p>The figures are frightening. The Metropolitan police estimates that 40% of robberies, 25% of all burglaries and 20% of thefts are committed by school-age children during school hours. Truanting or excluded, they roam the streets with nothing to do and nowhere to go: they are the crime wave, not waving but drowning. </p> <p>A report yesterday from the National Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders (Nacro) shows how closely crime is associated with school exclusion. Every year, 100,000 children are excluded temporarily and 12,000 permanently. That is a lot of children wandering about all day with trouble in mind. Many get only a few hours teaching a week. Many never get back into school again. What happens to them after that? No one knows, but studies of young offenders show that 42% have been excluded from school. The Nacro report is asking another important question: how much worse does school exclusion make them? The answer is this: excluded children commit 50% more crimes in the year after they are excluded than they did in the year before. </p> <p>What's to be done? One solution looks relatively simple: keep them in school and at least reduce their time on the streets. Finding that school exclusions had risen an astonishing four-fold in the 1990s, this was what the government set out to do and the social exclusion unit chose it as its very first subject to tackle. Two years ago it set tough new targets: truancy and school exclusion was to be reduced by one-third. The screw was tightened on schools suspected of dumping their failures in a bid to climb up the league tables. </p> <p>A stern circular was sent out demanding elaborate and complex procedures before any child could be excluded. Head teachers had to show that, before expulsion, children must have had a \"pastoral support programme\" to try to amend their behaviour. They needed a long record of previous offences and the last straw had to be something very serious. After much protest from schools, the circular was slightly amended this year: children don't have to see an educational psychologist before expulsion since the waiting lists are so long that it often takes six months. But it remains official policy to make it very difficult to get rid of a child. So far there's been a reduction of 3% in exclusions. </p> <p>Teachers are complaining that the policy is too tough. Curiously, the attitude towards these nightmare children is the opposite to the government's attitude towards neighbours from hell, whose removal is regarded as an essential ingredient in renewing disaster neighbourhoods. When it comes to schools, head teachers are supposed to hang on to them. Some heads have the worst children sitting beside them all day for lack of anyone else to guard them, which can't do much for the smooth running of their schools. The head who resigned recently from a showcase fresh-start school said he could have succeeded if only he had been able to expel seven hell-raisers. </p> <p>Yesterday I called one head in Liverpool, Tony Hardman of Archbishop Beck Roman Catholic High School, but there was a screaming siren down the telephone. A harassed secretary said sorry, but this was the third time today the fire alarm had been set off by one group of pupils. When I called again, the head was storming around in search of the troublemakers. Eventually he rang back: he said he'd never excluded more than one or two a year but he'd had a rash of brutal behaviour from some thugs recently and, yes, he had to get rid of them for the peace and sanity of the school and the parents. \"I've got two at the moment who are determined, really determined to be excluded, for kudos. What can you do?\" </p> <p>Under the government's excellence in the cities education programme, he's got \u00a380,000 extra a year to help prevent exclusions. He's trying to set up a pupil-support unit in a derelict pavilion near a playing field far from the main school. \"But every time I exclude one child I lose money too. I've lost \u00a320,000 from the project through exclusions. That's money that could and should have helped support some of the younger ones now to stop them getting excluded later on.\" </p> <p>This dowry system, where the money follows the child, has its own odd perversities: exclusions now follow the financial year. Tony Hardman says many more children are thrown out in March, at the end of the financial year, so that no money is lost, than after April when a whole year's money would follow them out of the school. This is all highly mechanistic and the heads complain there is no flexibility, no appeal. How can Hardman get his preventative unit built and staffed, as he hopes, with an educational psychologist and a welfare worker if he keeps losing money when he is forced to expel pupils? </p> <p>Labour is spending \u00a3500m over three years and has set itself a difficult target of getting every excluded child into full-time education by 2002 - that's 12,000 special-unit places required. More of these units are being set up inside schools, often linking together neighbouring schools. It's expensive treatment and Nacro reckons the money will be nothing like enough. They already run schemes around the country for children who have been (or are in grave danger of being) excluded from school. The idea is to engage their attention in something, anything that might interest them, leading to literacy and skills training or a way back to school. Some of their schemes work inside schools, all try to build close connections with families. </p> <p>Despite the success of these projects, with measured outcomes proving how well they work, there is very little money around for spreading them everywhere. While praising what the government has done so far, Nacro reckons the huge scale of the problem and the intensity of treatment these children need will require far more money. These scary crime figures are intended to show what good value the right intensive investment here would be. </p> <p>It isn't a zero-sum question. The government doesn't say no children should be excluded - but sometimes they seem not to grasp the full horror of life in the toughest schools. Imagine the places where young teachers have their backs against the door to stop wild children storming into their lesson. With a huge drop-out in teacher training courses and difficulty recruiting at all, exclusion has to be an important part of the armoury of any school head trying to keep a grip. </p> <p>True, some of the old sin bins for excluded children were dreadful. But there were some wonderful therapeutic projects that were shut down too in the slash-and-burn Thatcher era when education welfare and educational psychology were also cut to ribbons. One monolithic state programme will not be enough: imaginative successful projects run by innovative voluntary organisations will be a vital resource. The right kind of projects for children's very different problems will still be desperately needed to take in the hard cases head teachers will still need to throw out. </p>",

      "bodyText": "The figures are frightening. The Metropolitan police estimates that 40% of robberies, 25% of all burglaries and 20% of thefts are committed by school-age children during school hours. Truanting or excluded, they roam the streets with nothing to do and nowhere to go: they are the crime wave, not waving but drowning. A report yesterday from the National Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders (Nacro) shows how closely crime is associated with school exclusion. Every year, 100,000 children are excluded temporarily and 12,000 permanently. That is a lot of children wandering about all day with trouble in mind. Many get only a few hours teaching a week. Many never get back into school again. What happens to them after that? No one knows, but studies of young offenders show that 42% have been excluded from school. The Nacro report is asking another important question: how much worse does school exclusion make them? The answer is this: excluded children commit 50% more crimes in the year after they are excluded than they did in the year before. What's to be done? One solution looks relatively simple: keep them in school and at least reduce their time on the streets. Finding that school exclusions had risen an astonishing four-fold in the 1990s, this was what the government set out to do and the social exclusion unit chose it as its very first subject to tackle. Two years ago it set tough new targets: truancy and school exclusion was to be reduced by one-third. The screw was tightened on schools suspected of dumping their failures in a bid to climb up the league tables. A stern circular was sent out demanding elaborate and complex procedures before any child could be excluded. Head teachers had to show that, before expulsion, children must have had a \"pastoral support programme\" to try to amend their behaviour. They needed a long record of previous offences and the last straw had to be something very serious. After much protest from schools, the circular was slightly amended this year: children don't have to see an educational psychologist before expulsion since the waiting lists are so long that it often takes six months. But it remains official policy to make it very difficult to get rid of a child. So far there's been a reduction of 3% in exclusions. Teachers are complaining that the policy is too tough. Curiously, the attitude towards these nightmare children is the opposite to the government's attitude towards neighbours from hell, whose removal is regarded as an essential ingredient in renewing disaster neighbourhoods. When it comes to schools, head teachers are supposed to hang on to them. Some heads have the worst children sitting beside them all day for lack of anyone else to guard them, which can't do much for the smooth running of their schools. The head who resigned recently from a showcase fresh-start school said he could have succeeded if only he had been able to expel seven hell-raisers. Yesterday I called one head in Liverpool, Tony Hardman of Archbishop Beck Roman Catholic High School, but there was a screaming siren down the telephone. A harassed secretary said sorry, but this was the third time today the fire alarm had been set off by one group of pupils. When I called again, the head was storming around in search of the troublemakers. Eventually he rang back: he said he'd never excluded more than one or two a year but he'd had a rash of brutal behaviour from some thugs recently and, yes, he had to get rid of them for the peace and sanity of the school and the parents. \"I've got two at the moment who are determined, really determined to be excluded, for kudos. What can you do?\" Under the government's excellence in the cities education programme, he's got \u00a380,000 extra a year to help prevent exclusions. He's trying to set up a pupil-support unit in a derelict pavilion near a playing field far from the main school. \"But every time I exclude one child I lose money too. I've lost \u00a320,000 from the project through exclusions. That's money that could and should have helped support some of the younger ones now to stop them getting excluded later on.\" This dowry system, where the money follows the child, has its own odd perversities: exclusions now follow the financial year. Tony Hardman says many more children are thrown out in March, at the end of the financial year, so that no money is lost, than after April when a whole year's money would follow them out of the school. This is all highly mechanistic and the heads complain there is no flexibility, no appeal. How can Hardman get his preventative unit built and staffed, as he hopes, with an educational psychologist and a welfare worker if he keeps losing money when he is forced to expel pupils? Labour is spending \u00a3500m over three years and has set itself a difficult target of getting every excluded child into full-time education by 2002 - that's 12,000 special-unit places required. More of these units are being set up inside schools, often linking together neighbouring schools. It's expensive treatment and Nacro reckons the money will be nothing like enough. They already run schemes around the country for children who have been (or are in grave danger of being) excluded from school. The idea is to engage their attention in something, anything that might interest them, leading to literacy and skills training or a way back to school. Some of their schemes work inside schools, all try to build close connections with families. Despite the success of these projects, with measured outcomes proving how well they work, there is very little money around for spreading them everywhere. While praising what the government has done so far, Nacro reckons the huge scale of the problem and the intensity of treatment these children need will require far more money. These scary crime figures are intended to show what good value the right intensive investment here would be. It isn't a zero-sum question. The government doesn't say no children should be excluded - but sometimes they seem not to grasp the full horror of life in the toughest schools. Imagine the places where young teachers have their backs against the door to stop wild children storming into their lesson. With a huge drop-out in teacher training courses and difficulty recruiting at all, exclusion has to be an important part of the armoury of any school head trying to keep a grip. True, some of the old sin bins for excluded children were dreadful. But there were some wonderful therapeutic projects that were shut down too in the slash-and-burn Thatcher era when education welfare and educational psychology were also cut to ribbons. One monolithic state programme will not be enough: imaginative successful projects run by innovative voluntary organisations will be a vital resource. The right kind of projects for children's very different problems will still be desperately needed to take in the hard cases head teachers will still need to throw out.",

As I pointed out in a letter on the same day, the draft rankings are a public document available on the internet: they are not restricted to local authorities as you implied, so there is no need for them to have come from a leaked document. The review of the index has been carried out by a well-respected and independent team from the University of Oxford. There has been no manipulation of the results to suit areas represented by cabinet ministers. The position of areas is not \"the result of lobbying by non-London authorities\".

As I pointed out in a letter on the same day, the draft rankings are a public document available on the internet: they are not restricted to local authorities as you implied, so there is no need for them to have come from a leaked document. The review of the index has been carried out by a well-respected and independent team from the University of Oxford. There has been no manipulation of the results to suit areas represented by cabinet ministers. The position of areas is not \"the result of lobbying by non-London authorities\".

After 1989, Istok's ethnic Albanian guards were progressively dismissed - the last Albanian on the staff went in 1994 - and replaced by ethnic Serbs. Since the defeat of the Yugoslav army last year, most Serbs have fled to Serbia, leaving mainly ethnic Albanians to be recruited. Their experience may be five to 10 years out of date but Mr Irvine and senior Canadian prisoner officers working alongside him hope eventually to return the institution to Kosovans.",

A national survey of 782 academics at British universities found that 53% reported poor psychological health, including stress, sleeplessness and depression, while 44% of university lecturers had seriously considered leaving higher education and 49% had considered early retirement over the past few years. The survey, presented at the British Psychological Society conference, also found that 25% of academics had suffered a stress-related illness in the past year. Gail Kinman, a psychologist at Luton University, and Fiona Jones, a principal lecturer in psychology at Hertfordshire University, compiled the study on behalf of the Association of University Teachers. They found that three-quarters of academics who responded to their survey believed that their universities and working conditions had undergone too many changes in recent years.

      "body": "<p>Universities are reporting a sharp rise in applications from Scottish students since a decision by the Scottish executive in December to exempt them from up-front tuition fees. </p> <p>Figures released yesterday by the universities and colleges admissions service (Ucas) showed that applications between December 16 and March 24 were 19% higher than over the same period a year before. </p> <p>Tony Higgins, the Ucas chief executive, drew a link between increased demand for places among Scottish students and the decision to replace up-front fees with payments after graduation. Students from the rest of the UK will continue to pay the fees, currently \u00a31,025. </p> <p>\"In December Scottish applicants were 2.5% down on the previous year.

Figures released yesterday by the universities and colleges admissions service (Ucas) showed that applications between December 16 and March 24 were 19% higher than over the same period a year before. Tony Higgins, the Ucas chief executive, drew a link between increased demand for places among Scottish students and the decision to replace up-front fees with payments after graduation. Students from the rest of the UK will continue to pay the fees, currently \u00a31,025. \"In December Scottish applicants were 2.5% down on the previous year. Scotland was showing the biggest fall in applicants among UK countries, but now it is showing the biggest rise,\" he said. \"We had more applications than usual from Scotland between December and March, which seems to indicate that many people were delaying their application until they knew either the recommendations of the Cubie inquiry or the Scottish executive's decisions on tuition fees.\" That interpretation was challenged by the Department for Education and Employment.

More than 200 local parties have failed to nominate representatives for September's week-long showcase in Brighton in an unprecedented protest by Labour's rank and file. The seaside no-show is the clearest evidence yet of a backlash among party activists over the direction of the government and accusations that Mr Blair is riding roughshod over the interests of ordinary members. A report by senior officials in Labour's Millbank headquarters to the party's conference arrangements committee yesterday disclosed that more than 200 of the 641 constituencies had not picked delegates. The figure sent shockwaves through the party hierarchy and reflects growing disillusionment among members over Mr Blair's focus on middle Britain rather than traditional Labour voters. The prime minister has also been accused of \"control freakery\" over his campaign against Ken Livingstone in London and attempts to influence post-devolution contests in Scotland and Wales. A Labour insider said last night: \"No one seems to be interested in going along to stand and clap speeches they don't really believe in. This revolt has been brewing since the election.

Which was bad.\" Doon Mackichan, if it wasn't immediately obvious, is detailing the making of the second series of Smack The Pony. \"And I got to drive a tractor. Which was good.\" Mackichan, along with Sally Phillips and Fiona Allen, returns to Channel 4 (tonight, 9.30pm) for more nonsensical sketches about - you guessed it - cows and tractors and quite possibly some other stuff. So what should we expect? She thinks for a minute. \"Well, it's the same as it was before... but much more boring.\" </p> <p>Smack The Pony may be many things, but boring it ain't. Although obviously starring (and mostly written by) women, its humour comes from absurdity, not gags about mammaries and menstrual cramps. And while experiences which are specific to women - putting on make-up, trying to run in high heels - may form the basis for a sketch, the jokes never come from the subject matter alone. </p> <p>\"When I did stand-up,\" says Allen, \"I never did knob jokes, so I don't see why we would now.\" \"Nobody really does those,\" Mackichan chips in, \"or jokes about periods. Do they? Isn't it just a myth?\" Allen shakes her head: \"Oh no, they do. They do.\" But that's a million miles away from the stuff this lot turn out. They get particularly animated when discussing a sketch about a girl-band scoring a martial arts movie. \"I do tae kwon do,\" Allen explains, \"and I'd never got to use it until now. So we got to fly through the air and everything...\" She trails off, smiling. The only real difference between series one and two that the trio will admit to is that, as Phillips puts it: \"We all know each other now, so we're more confident and work better together. And we don't have to pretend to be nice first thing in the morning.\" </p> <p>The positive chemistry between them is obvious, belying the fact that, although they had all done stand-up prior to the show, they'd never worked together before. \"We were thrown together,\" Phillips continues. \"It could've been a disaster, but it worked out in the end.\" </p> <p>\"Yes,\" affirms Allen in a deadpan monotone. \"And now we're really all the best of friends.\" </p> <p>Not that a lot of people want to believe it. \"It's stupid,\" says Mackichan, \"but it's incredible the number of people we get going, 'I bet you really hate each other. Go on - we just want to know about the bitch fights.' \" Bitch fights notwithstanding, I wonder if they've felt they've been treated differently as comedians because they're, well, comediennes. It's obviously an emotive subject. </p> <p>\"We've got very different opinions on this one,\" Phillips muses. Fiona explains: \"I've never ever understood that idea at all. The only time I ever experienced it was someone saying, 'Not bad for a girl' when I was doing a gig. But that was my mate, so I don't think it counts.\" </p> <p>For Mackichan and Phillips, experiences have proved different. \"I always got a lot of comments when I did stand-up,\" says the former, \"although I did play a lot of laddish places. But I do think there's an idea that as a woman you're just not naturally funny...\" Phillips interjects: \"And I feel that I definitely have experienced some funny attitudes towards me. There's a group of lads that I grew up doing comedy with, who everyone knows as comedians. But whenever I do anything it's always \"actress Sally Phillips\", despite the fact I don't do any straight drama at all, ever.\" So what do the others, who both dabble in \"proper\" acting, think about the differences between that and comedy? \"I'd rather have red hot pokers in my eyes than do Shakespeare,\" Allen mutters. Mackichan, on the other hand, is \"happy either way - I'm a bit of a slag really.\" But when they're doing comedy, where do they see themselves fitting in among the ubiquitous slew of small-screen sketch shows? \"I don't think we need to fit in anywhere,\" replies Allen. \"It just is what it is.\" </p> <p>Doon picks up the thread: \"There was a weird synthesis between our first series and Big Train - unbeknownst to each other, we had a lot of similar ideas.\" \"But that's about it,\" adds Phillips. </p> <p>So, finally, what exactly do they enjoy about working together? \"The best and worst thing,\" says Allen, \"is that I couldn't stop laughing uncontrollably - which is great, but really pisses everyone off.\" For Mackichan, meanwhile, \"being on set together, you do end up being like naughty schoolgirls. All that hanging about lends itself to mischief.\" And Phillips? \"I love working with these two, but there are some drawbacks. If you're working with blokes, and you're the only girl, you get to do all the women's parts. Admittedly, you're only saying 'Do you want a cappuccino?', but you can do it in four different accents.\" </p> <p>\"Right,\" Mackichan goes on. \"And then there's the old lady, the nurse, the secretary, the bitch... Oh, and the pre-menstrual girlfriend.\" </p> <p>Luckily there won't be too many of those parts popping up in Smack The Pony. And, if they do, they'll be doing kung fu or driving a tractor as well as making the coffee.</p>",

Then the TV lot descend again in October. </p> <p>The TV festivals, unlike the glamorous film shindig, are dominated by wall-to-wall suits. It really is a gathering of those behind the screen, intent on staying behind the screen but making sure that they have some new programmes to put on it. So the sprinkling of celebs among the proceedings is always a welcome interruption. </p> <p>This year, Vic and Bob were wheeled out to publicise the international launch of the (revived) Randall &amp; Hopkirk (Deceased). Which they duly did with a photocall, drinkies and a dinner with selected hacks. </p> <p>All was going according to plan, with the duo - plus writing partner and performer Charlie Higson - presenting themselves as relaxed and not intimidatingly cutting. The surprise discovery of a slug delicately balanced on a crisp lettuce leaf in the restaurant where the schmooze-fest took place did momentarily threaten to interrupt proceedings. Cries of \"Le Monster!\" in broad Geordie fortunately received no attention from the aloof French waiting staff. Life got a little flabbier later on when a very relaxed Vic, or Jim as we now like to call him, disappeared into a packed hotel bar with two fawning female accompaniments. Anyone seen him since? </p> <p>\u0095 Lucy Rouse is editor of Broadcast magazine</p>",

      "bodyText": "Life behind the screen this week shifted to Cannes on the sunny Cote d'Azur, except this year it rained - just as Londres last weekend got its first taste of summer. The occasion was Mip-TV, another annual fixture in the TV calendar, and one where buyers and sellers of TV programmes converge on the glitzy Mediterranean town to engage in an orgy of networking, boozing, fine dining and business (not necessarily in that order). Cannes plays host to a number of these bizarre gatherings throughout the year, with the Cannes film festival next up in May, followed by an advertising festival later in the summer. Then the TV lot descend again in October. The TV festivals, unlike the glamorous film shindig, are dominated by wall-to-wall suits. It really is a gathering of those behind the screen, intent on staying behind the screen but making sure that they have some new programmes to put on it. So the sprinkling of celebs among the proceedings is always a welcome interruption. This year, Vic and Bob were wheeled out to publicise the international launch of the (revived) Randall &amp; Hopkirk (Deceased). Which they duly did with a photocall, drinkies and a dinner with selected hacks. All was going according to plan, with the duo - plus writing partner and performer Charlie Higson - presenting themselves as relaxed and not intimidatingly cutting. The surprise discovery of a slug delicately balanced on a crisp lettuce leaf in the restaurant where the schmooze-fest took place did momentarily threaten to interrupt proceedings. Cries of \"Le Monster!\" in broad Geordie fortunately received no attention from the aloof French waiting staff. Life got a little flabbier later on when a very relaxed Vic, or Jim as we now like to call him, disappeared into a packed hotel bar with two fawning female accompaniments. Anyone seen him since? \u0095 Lucy Rouse is editor of Broadcast magazine",

He added: \"I have always thought it would go to a second ballot and it would be a very close-run thing.\"</p> <p>The former Greater London council leader will have been damaged to some extent by controversies over his finances and public pronouncements -the ICM poll was conducted in the wake of his remarks about international finance and third world deaths - but the net effect is that he is back where he was last November before the backlash over Labour's selection \"stitch-up\".</p> <p>Mr Dobson shrugged off the statistically insignificant drop in his support, jubilant that voters were abandoning Mr Livingstone \"in droves\" and insisting: \"As the seriousness of the campaign and the seriousness of the mayor's job become more widely known, I will do better.\"</p> <p>Mr Norris agreed that there was now \"a bit more realism entering the contest\" and claimed that the election was now about \"Steve v Ken - it's a good prizefight.\"</p> <p>With Mr Livingstone back below 50% and his rivals locked in a three-way fight for second place, the focus on where the candidates' second preference votes go is likely to grow. If nobody wins more than 50% of the vote, the second preferences of all except the two frontrunners are distributed between them.</p> <p>Ms Kramer claimed the momentum was with her campaign and seized on the latest polling results to insist she was the only candidate who could now stop Mr Livingstone, because she would take most second preference votes from the other two main candidates.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Support for the London mayoral frontrunner, Ken Livingstone, has dropped 12 points to 49%, according to an opinion poll published yesterday, but he maintains a commanding 33-point lead. Labour's Frank Dobson has fallen into third place behind the Tory, Steve Norris. The ICM poll for the Evening Standard found only 15% of Londoners plan to vote for the official Labour candidate for mayor on May 4, though Labour is still comfortably in the lead for the Greater London assembly elections on the same day. Both Mr Norris, on 16%, and the Liberal Democrat, Susan Kramer - who is up four points at 12% and yesterday claimed she could win on second preferences - have benefited from Mr Livingstone's loss of support since the last poll a month ago, but Mr Dobson has marginally lost ground over the same period. Mr Livingstone, who is standing as an independent, predicted that the mayoral contest would be a \"tight fight\" now that his poll ratings were back to \"realistic levels\". He added: \"I have always thought it would go to a second ballot and it would be a very close-run thing.\" The former Greater London council leader will have been damaged to some extent by controversies over his finances and public pronouncements -the ICM poll was conducted in the wake of his remarks about international finance and third world deaths - but the net effect is that he is back where he was last November before the backlash over Labour's selection \"stitch-up\". Mr Dobson shrugged off the statistically insignificant drop in his support, jubilant that voters were abandoning Mr Livingstone \"in droves\" and insisting: \"As the seriousness of the campaign and the seriousness of the mayor's job become more widely known, I will do better.\" Mr Norris agreed that there was now \"a bit more realism entering the contest\" and claimed that the election was now about \"Steve v Ken - it's a good prizefight.\" With Mr Livingstone back below 50% and his rivals locked in a three-way fight for second place, the focus on where the candidates' second preference votes go is likely to grow. If nobody wins more than 50% of the vote, the second preferences of all except the two frontrunners are distributed between them. Ms Kramer claimed the momentum was with her campaign and seized on the latest polling results to insist she was the only candidate who could now stop Mr Livingstone, because she would take most second preference votes from the other two main candidates.",

      "body": "<p>The world of architecture has always boasted mavericks, who produce buildings utterly outside the reigning aesthetic, barely complying with regulations, yet escaping ridicule or suppression through their childlike authenticity, embellishment and logic. Elemer Zalotay has a following in Switzerland for work of this kind, while Lucien Kroll attracted even greater attention in Belgium. Both were born about the same time as the Austrian artist and architect Friedensreich Hundertwasser, who has died aged 71, on board the Queen Elizabeth II en route from his New Zealand farm to Europe.</p> <p>Born Friedrich Stowasser into a poor Viennese family, he was brought up by his Jewish mother; his father had been a civil servant and an officer in the Austro-Hungarian army, but died shortly after Friedrich was born. His mother sent him to a Montessori school for a year to develop his artistic talents; after the Anschluss with Germany in 1938, she put him in the Hitler Youth, thus saving both their lives during the second world war.</p> <p>In 1948 Friedrich enrolled at the Vienna Academy of Art (where Hitler had unsuccessfully sought admission 40 years earlier). Although admitted, Friedrich left after three months, and avoided all further institutional education. He changed his surname to Hundertwasser - \"sto\" in most Slavic languages means 100 - and became an artist. Modifications to his first name continued, until at the height of the dis turbances of 1968, he hit upon Friedensreich, \"peaceful realm\".</p> <p>Rejecting instruction, and scornful of the reigning modernism, he modelled his highly decorative approach on the art nouveau period, with swirling spiral compositions reminiscent of Gustav Klimt. He was denounced as decadent, but continued, and his work became remorselessly popular, selling well and being exhibited widely.</p> <p>In 1951, aged 23, he was sufficiently important to be admitted to the Art Club of Vienna, and four years later, after the Red Army had withdrawn from Austria, he began his lifelong foreign travel, at first to locations where his work was exhibited, but later to destinations in Africa, Tahiti, Asia and the Pacific. When he became wealthy enough, he bought property in New Zealand and later spent much time there.</p> <p>Hundertwasser became involved with architecture because he criticised it. In 1959, as a visiting lecturer in Hamburg, he denounced the aridity of modern architecture, ridiculed symmetry - by wearing different coloured socks - and described straight lines, horizontals and verticals as \"the tool of the devil\" and \"the rotten foundation of our doomed civilisation\". He denounced the professional institutions of architecture because they would not permit practice by amateurs. This, he said, proved that architecture was not an art, but a professional conspiracy.</p> <p>Hundertwasser developed these ideas into his Mouldiness Manifesto, a document that enjoyed great popularity during the heyday of the counter-culture, and which introduced him to the American environmental movement, which he supported to the point where, in 1980, he planted 100 trees in Washington - on what he decided to call \"Hundertwasser Day\".</p> <p>In the 1970s, aiming to break into the closed shop of architecture, he used his fortune and notoriety to establish himself as the leading European representative of an alternative, non-profes sional \"organic\" architecture movement. From the outset, he ridiculed and rejected rationalist and functionalist architectural theory, and scorned every manifestation of industrialised architecture with standardised, repeated components.

      "bodyText": "The world of architecture has always boasted mavericks, who produce buildings utterly outside the reigning aesthetic, barely complying with regulations, yet escaping ridicule or suppression through their childlike authenticity, embellishment and logic. Elemer Zalotay has a following in Switzerland for work of this kind, while Lucien Kroll attracted even greater attention in Belgium. Both were born about the same time as the Austrian artist and architect Friedensreich Hundertwasser, who has died aged 71, on board the Queen Elizabeth II en route from his New Zealand farm to Europe. Born Friedrich Stowasser into a poor Viennese family, he was brought up by his Jewish mother; his father had been a civil servant and an officer in the Austro-Hungarian army, but died shortly after Friedrich was born. His mother sent him to a Montessori school for a year to develop his artistic talents; after the Anschluss with Germany in 1938, she put him in the Hitler Youth, thus saving both their lives during the second world war. In 1948 Friedrich enrolled at the Vienna Academy of Art (where Hitler had unsuccessfully sought admission 40 years earlier). Although admitted, Friedrich left after three months, and avoided all further institutional education. He changed his surname to Hundertwasser - \"sto\" in most Slavic languages means 100 - and became an artist. Modifications to his first name continued, until at the height of the dis turbances of 1968, he hit upon Friedensreich, \"peaceful realm\". Rejecting instruction, and scornful of the reigning modernism, he modelled his highly decorative approach on the art nouveau period, with swirling spiral compositions reminiscent of Gustav Klimt. He was denounced as decadent, but continued, and his work became remorselessly popular, selling well and being exhibited widely. In 1951, aged 23, he was sufficiently important to be admitted to the Art Club of Vienna, and four years later, after the Red Army had withdrawn from Austria, he began his lifelong foreign travel, at first to locations where his work was exhibited, but later to destinations in Africa, Tahiti, Asia and the Pacific. When he became wealthy enough, he bought property in New Zealand and later spent much time there. Hundertwasser became involved with architecture because he criticised it. In 1959, as a visiting lecturer in Hamburg, he denounced the aridity of modern architecture, ridiculed symmetry - by wearing different coloured socks - and described straight lines, horizontals and verticals as \"the tool of the devil\" and \"the rotten foundation of our doomed civilisation\". He denounced the professional institutions of architecture because they would not permit practice by amateurs. This, he said, proved that architecture was not an art, but a professional conspiracy. Hundertwasser developed these ideas into his Mouldiness Manifesto, a document that enjoyed great popularity during the heyday of the counter-culture, and which introduced him to the American environmental movement, which he supported to the point where, in 1980, he planted 100 trees in Washington - on what he decided to call \"Hundertwasser Day\". In the 1970s, aiming to break into the closed shop of architecture, he used his fortune and notoriety to establish himself as the leading European representative of an alternative, non-profes sional \"organic\" architecture movement. From the outset, he ridiculed and rejected rationalist and functionalist architectural theory, and scorned every manifestation of industrialised architecture with standardised, repeated components. He sought to create buildings that were giant versions of his own artworks, with chaotically disposed windows and cellular plans featuring rooms of different sizes and shapes, tortuous circulation spaces, undulating floors, balconies and roof gardens. The result was an architectural anthropomorphism that never succeeded in transferring convincingly to full sized, built form, despite the anarchic promise of the sketch and model stage. Hundertwasser's best-known building - and the clearest illustration of his failure to eradicate straight lines - was the Hundertwasser Haus, a block of flats for Vienna city council, opened in 1986. With 50 apartments and modern communal facilities, it tries hard to obscure its conventional engineering shape by means of planting and non-organic embellishments, scattered windows, undulating stripes of colour and mosaics of broken glass and crockery. It was joined in 1991 by the Hundertwasser museum. More successful in conventional architectural terms was his work in the Austrian town of Blumau, where he designed a thermal bath-house and was working on a vast leisure and housing park project at the time of his death. Hundertwasser was an artist who relied on attack and inspiration, and neither ever let him down. He was twice married for short periods; both unions ended in divorce.

The job of culture minister went to Theodore Pangalos, who during a spell as foreign minister last year sent waves across the Atlantic by calling President Bill Clinton a \"shameless liar\" for failing to keep his promise to solve the problem of divided Cyprus. That fit of pique sent Greco-American relations into an unprecedented downward spiral and had western diplomats wondering whether \"King Gaffe\" had lost his marbles. Soon after that he raised Turkish hackles by accusing Ankara of \"dragging its muddy boots across the carpets of Europe\", and lambasted the British media for its \"disgustingly racist\" portrayal of Greeks as hot-headed hedonists. In 1995, weeks before Greece assumed the rotating presidency of the European Union, he chastised Germany for behaving like \"a bestial giant with a child's brain\". Yesterday he lost no time in losing friends in London and Rome. Within minutes of the new government being sworn in, he declared: \"We have to promote our big projects, starting with the return of the Parthenon marbles, which belong to us, and to create the archaeological areas that will change the heart of Athens so that Athens can soon become much better than Rome.\" Never scared of a fight, Mr Pangalos, 62, said the battle to retrieve the 2,500-year-old marbles, brought to Britain by the Earl of Elgin and sold to the government in 1816, would require the creation of \"the most suitable solidarity movement\" in Britain. \"Greece also has to build the museum that will receive them,\" he said referring to the cultural behemoth Athens plans to erect by 2004, when it hosts the Olympic games. \"Which we will do.\" A man whose intellect is said to be as big as his girth, Mr Pangalos has earned himself considerable popularity at home by his outspoken ways.

      "bodyText": "Four Iranian Jews admitted spying for Israel during a closed court hearing in southern Iran yesterday, a judicial official claimed. Their lawyer denied that any confessions were made. A total of 13 Iranian Jews have been charged with espionage in the case, which has sparked international outrage. \"The judge met four of the suspects this morning and they confessed to the charges against them and asked for forgiveness from the judge,\" said Hassan Ali Amiri, the head of the Shiraz judiciary. But Esmail Nasseri, a leading defence attorney, said that the defendants did not formally confess. \"They may have done so privately, but the judge did not announce any indictment for us to present a defence. We categorically deny any confessions were made.\" The crime of espionage can be punished with anything from a six-month prison term to the death sentence. Another three of the 13 Iranian Jews facing espionage charges also appeared before Judge Sadeq Nourani. The three, who were released on bail last year, were told to return for a second hearing on May 1, when all 13 - who include five Hebrew teachers, a teenage student and several shopkeepers - will appear in court. The four defendants who allegedly confessed, and the remaining six suspects, who did not appear in court yesterday, are all still in custody.

      "body": "<p>Few have scaled such heights of acclaim and adulation but that was no comfort to Luciano Pavarotti yesterday when accusations of greed, betrayal and fading talent tipped him into a spectacular fall from the world stage.</p> <p>A series of body blows from the Italian inland revenue climaxed with a court ruling that he pay a \u00a33m fine for tax evasion to a state that has branded him a traitor.</p> <p>The opera singer may now face criminal charges and a trial. A tribunal in Bologna yesterday rejected his appeal against an \"ungrateful\" Italian state and ordered him to pay the missing tax, which dates from 1989 to 1991. Investigators are now poring over all his financial affairs.</p> <p>Italians greeted the news with indifference and hostility rather than sympathy, for the tenor has fallen fast and far. The Pavarotti who straddled the world at the 1990 Three Tenors concert in Rome, alongside Placido Domingo and Jose Carreras, is a memory. A bitter divorce and shambolic performances have drawn catcalls and sapped his status as a cultural force to the point where he is seen more often in TV adverts than on stage.</p> <p>Clashes with the taxman drained his popularity as it emerged that he pretended to live in Monaco to avoid paying tax on his estimated \u00a3300m fortune. The often-criticised finance ministry has been hailed for exposing his claim as false. The 64-year-old spends more time on his estate in Modena, where he owns a racecourse and restaurant, than he does in his small flat in the Mediterranean principality.</p> <p>Few have rushed to his defence since a senior ministry official branded him a traitor to Italy. Tax authorities suspect Pavarotti owes them \u00a35m from undeclared income earned in nine countries. The tenor argued that he should owe Italy nothing because he paid tax in those countries. Rather than settle quietly he chose to fight, provoking the Bologna tribunal to impose its huge fine.</p> <p>In January Pavarotti agreed to pay \u00a31.6m after losing another battle over tax. The tenor negotiated an agreement to pay back the tax and interest in 36 monthly instalments of \u00a345,000.</p> <p>Other opera singers including Katia Ricciarelli, Giovanni Raimondo and Pietro Ballo have been snared in the centre-left government's crackdown but none has endured the humiliation of Pavarotti.</p> <p>His private life meshed with the investigation after paparazzi snapped him canoodling with his secretary, Nicoletta Mantovani, 31, in a hammock in the Caribbean.

      "bodyText": "Few have scaled such heights of acclaim and adulation but that was no comfort to Luciano Pavarotti yesterday when accusations of greed, betrayal and fading talent tipped him into a spectacular fall from the world stage. A series of body blows from the Italian inland revenue climaxed with a court ruling that he pay a \u00a33m fine for tax evasion to a state that has branded him a traitor. The opera singer may now face criminal charges and a trial. A tribunal in Bologna yesterday rejected his appeal against an \"ungrateful\" Italian state and ordered him to pay the missing tax, which dates from 1989 to 1991. Investigators are now poring over all his financial affairs. Italians greeted the news with indifference and hostility rather than sympathy, for the tenor has fallen fast and far. The Pavarotti who straddled the world at the 1990 Three Tenors concert in Rome, alongside Placido Domingo and Jose Carreras, is a memory. A bitter divorce and shambolic performances have drawn catcalls and sapped his status as a cultural force to the point where he is seen more often in TV adverts than on stage. Clashes with the taxman drained his popularity as it emerged that he pretended to live in Monaco to avoid paying tax on his estimated \u00a3300m fortune. The often-criticised finance ministry has been hailed for exposing his claim as false. The 64-year-old spends more time on his estate in Modena, where he owns a racecourse and restaurant, than he does in his small flat in the Mediterranean principality. Few have rushed to his defence since a senior ministry official branded him a traitor to Italy. Tax authorities suspect Pavarotti owes them \u00a35m from undeclared income earned in nine countries. The tenor argued that he should owe Italy nothing because he paid tax in those countries. Rather than settle quietly he chose to fight, provoking the Bologna tribunal to impose its huge fine. In January Pavarotti agreed to pay \u00a31.6m after losing another battle over tax. The tenor negotiated an agreement to pay back the tax and interest in 36 monthly instalments of \u00a345,000. Other opera singers including Katia Ricciarelli, Giovanni Raimondo and Pietro Ballo have been snared in the centre-left government's crackdown but none has endured the humiliation of Pavarotti. His private life meshed with the investigation after paparazzi snapped him canoodling with his secretary, Nicoletta Mantovani, 31, in a hammock in the Caribbean. The singer's wife, Adua Veroni, 62, filed for divorce to end their 35-year-old marriage but a deal to share assets pending a final settlement disintegrated. Ms Veroni, claiming partial credit for her husband's success, reputedly wanted \u00a370m. Pavarotti said no and his wife, who is known to believe he was understating his income, collaborated with the tax authorities. Divorce proceedings have delayed his marriage to Ms Mantovani and further tarnished his image. And with calamitous timing the tenor's voice appears to be failing.

      "body": "<b> Forget his past</b> <br> <p> If you go into self-destruct mode you won't even get as far as trying to trust him. You seem to be already embarking on a pattern of insecurity and mistrust which will push him away, and you will inevitably lose him. Your question is: \"How do I trust him?\" I say: \"How do you not trust him?\" You mention his dubious past and yet you strongly praise his present virtues. </p> <p>Trust is based on confidence, and you shouldn't have it tainted as a result of past hearsay. His past infidelities were a result of past relationships which you cannot change. You have described a full and rewarding relationship with someone you obviously love, which you are in danger of jeopardising if you don't let go of your own personal insecurities. You have no reason not to trust him. History is nothing. We live now. <br><b> Josie MawnBrighton</b></p> <p><b> You must trust him</b><br> </p> <p>I write as a self-confessed serial adulterer who, 12 years ago, came to see the error of my ways and feel the deep pain I had caused others. I felt guilty and ashamed. </p> <p>My conclusions also led me to see that adultery isn't a betrayal that is carried out in solitude; it actually requires the active participation of at least one other person; often more people are involved than the two main players. </p> <p>You should consider two issues. Firstly, watching him like a hawk will almost certainly result in a self-fulfilling prophecy and he'll do something silly - men are like that. Secondly, as he gets older (and more emotionally insecure) it will occur to him that there are few things more ridiculous in this world than a silly old man losing his dignity with a woman half his age. Serial adultery is for people under 26. </p> <p>Finally, he really does need to be trusted; this way he can rejoin the human race and this will prove he is a much nicer person than you give him credit for. Everyone deserves a chance. I was offered a chance by a woman who was told \"she ought to know better\" and we've been happy together for a long time now. I shall remain grateful that she didn't listen to others and become consumed by her own doubts. <br><b> Name and address supplied </b></p> <p><b> He won't change</b><br> </p> <p> If you value fidelity, loyalty and trustworthiness above everything else, then, sadly, you have fallen in love with the wrong type of man. Promiscuity is a characteristic of the young, and if he hasn't grown out of it by his 30s he never will. The fact that this otherwise honourable and compassionate human being has two failed marriages behind him is not a good sign. And - surprise, surprise - he is years older then you! </p> <p>Your relationship will disintegrate sooner, rather than later, if you continue to question him about his activities and to brood. The only way you could hope to salvage the relationship, if the affection and the mutual support it entails are worth salvaging, is by taking the conscious decision that you will stop caring if he is unfaithful to you. It is certainly not everybody's cup of tea and it would not be mine, but it works for some couples. Whatever happens, I wish you happiness. </p> <p> I am in a loving relationship with a man who has a history of infidelity. It began before his separation from his second wife. He is some years older than me and it seems to me that his philandering was, in the main, due to a different generational approach to remaining in a marriage no matter how unhappy it was. </p> <p>In all other areas of life he is honourable and compassionate. However, I find myself becoming increasingly distrustful of him. He tries to reassure me, but I now doubt that, after a lifetime of profligacy, he can commit himself to a relationship. </p> <p>I am starting to question him about his activities and I brood on the situation in self-destructive ways. Is it possible to trust someone with such a history? If so, how?<br><b> Name and address supplied </b></p> <p><b>Next week</b></p> <p> My partner and I have been together for over two years. He divorced his wife eight months after we met. Our love has made us immensely happy, and has survived periods of extreme difficulty due to the pain and disruption it has caused his ex-wife and children (aged 16 and 12). He has a cordial relationship with his ex-wife and sees his children daily. </p> <p>They know nothing about me, a decision my boyfriend took with my support. We don't live together since he feels this would interfere with his relationship with his children. We have only been on holiday together once, for three days, because he always spends his holidays with his son and daughter. I have found this understandable, but now, as the Easter break approaches, I feel we deserve some time away together. </p> <p>Also, his holidays are spent with his former mother-in-law and her daughters as well as his children. He does not enjoy this, as his ex-wife's family haven't forgiven him. He loves his children and goes out of guilt and a sense of responsibility. Should I put my foot down, or simply hope our relationship will be normalised in time? Would it help him to put things into perspective if I spoke to him firmly? </p> <p>\u0095 Private Lives appears every Friday. Each week we publish a letter to which readers are invited to respond.

      "bodyText": "Forget his past If you go into self-destruct mode you won't even get as far as trying to trust him. You seem to be already embarking on a pattern of insecurity and mistrust which will push him away, and you will inevitably lose him. Your question is: \"How do I trust him?\" I say: \"How do you not trust him?\" You mention his dubious past and yet you strongly praise his present virtues. Trust is based on confidence, and you shouldn't have it tainted as a result of past hearsay. His past infidelities were a result of past relationships which you cannot change. You have described a full and rewarding relationship with someone you obviously love, which you are in danger of jeopardising if you don't let go of your own personal insecurities. You have no reason not to trust him. History is nothing. We live now. Josie MawnBrighton You must trust him I write as a self-confessed serial adulterer who, 12 years ago, came to see the error of my ways and feel the deep pain I had caused others. I felt guilty and ashamed. My conclusions also led me to see that adultery isn't a betrayal that is carried out in solitude; it actually requires the active participation of at least one other person; often more people are involved than the two main players. You should consider two issues. Firstly, watching him like a hawk will almost certainly result in a self-fulfilling prophecy and he'll do something silly - men are like that. Secondly, as he gets older (and more emotionally insecure) it will occur to him that there are few things more ridiculous in this world than a silly old man losing his dignity with a woman half his age. Serial adultery is for people under 26. Finally, he really does need to be trusted; this way he can rejoin the human race and this will prove he is a much nicer person than you give him credit for. Everyone deserves a chance. I was offered a chance by a woman who was told \"she ought to know better\" and we've been happy together for a long time now. I shall remain grateful that she didn't listen to others and become consumed by her own doubts. Name and address supplied He won't change If you value fidelity, loyalty and trustworthiness above everything else, then, sadly, you have fallen in love with the wrong type of man. Promiscuity is a characteristic of the young, and if he hasn't grown out of it by his 30s he never will. The fact that this otherwise honourable and compassionate human being has two failed marriages behind him is not a good sign. And - surprise, surprise - he is years older then you! Your relationship will disintegrate sooner, rather than later, if you continue to question him about his activities and to brood. The only way you could hope to salvage the relationship, if the affection and the mutual support it entails are worth salvaging, is by taking the conscious decision that you will stop caring if he is unfaithful to you. It is certainly not everybody's cup of tea and it would not be mine, but it works for some couples. Whatever happens, I wish you happiness. I am in a loving relationship with a man who has a history of infidelity. It began before his separation from his second wife. He is some years older than me and it seems to me that his philandering was, in the main, due to a different generational approach to remaining in a marriage no matter how unhappy it was. In all other areas of life he is honourable and compassionate. However, I find myself becoming increasingly distrustful of him. He tries to reassure me, but I now doubt that, after a lifetime of profligacy, he can commit himself to a relationship. I am starting to question him about his activities and I brood on the situation in self-destructive ways. Is it possible to trust someone with such a history? If so, how? Name and address supplied Next week My partner and I have been together for over two years. He divorced his wife eight months after we met. Our love has made us immensely happy, and has survived periods of extreme difficulty due to the pain and disruption it has caused his ex-wife and children (aged 16 and 12). He has a cordial relationship with his ex-wife and sees his children daily. They know nothing about me, a decision my boyfriend took with my support. We don't live together since he feels this would interfere with his relationship with his children. We have only been on holiday together once, for three days, because he always spends his holidays with his son and daughter. I have found this understandable, but now, as the Easter break approaches, I feel we deserve some time away together. Also, his holidays are spent with his former mother-in-law and her daughters as well as his children. He does not enjoy this, as his ex-wife's family haven't forgiven him. He loves his children and goes out of guilt and a sense of responsibility. Should I put my foot down, or simply hope our relationship will be normalised in time? Would it help him to put things into perspective if I spoke to him firmly? \u0095 Private Lives appears every Friday. Each week we publish a letter to which readers are invited to respond.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>As usual, the restaurant La Maison du Caviar, a spot noted for showbiz and film celebrities near the Champs Elys\u00e9es, is jam-packed with beautiful people. Michel Serrault (of La Cage aux Folles fame) steps into the plush, dimly-lit dining room, searches momentarily for his friends, then strides over to a table where fellow actors Andr\u00e9 Dussollier, Jacques Villeret and Jean-Pierre Marielle are feasting on blinis, smoked salmon and vodka.</p> <p>\"Did you save me the worst seat on purpose?\" he barks at them. \"There's obviously a hidden camera or you wouldn't all be sitting sideways, looking in the same direction!\" Ignoring their bewildered protests, Serrault is clearly in a foul mood and intends to make a scene. He turns his back to the group and straddles his chair, breathing down the neck of an elegant woman at the neighbouring table. \"There,\" he sighs dramatically. \"Now I'm in the picture too!\" </p> <p>\"Cut!\" says director Bertrand Blier, who can barely contain his laughter. This scene is just one among innumerable confrontations between a group of ageing male movie stars, who play \"themselves\" in Blier's latest dark comedy, Les Acteurs (The Actors). In a parade of France's biggest names in cinema, everyone from G\u00e9rard Depardieu and Alain Delon to Jean-Paul Belmondo and Michel Piccoli turn up unexpectedly in the film's free-floating intrigue, partly set on the streets of Paris. </p> <p>However, most of the real \"action\" - if you can call it that - takes place within the timeless red velvet walls of this famed restaurant, painstakingly reconstructed in the hangars of the Epinay studios. With its revolving door for entrances and exits, it's also the perfect theatrical setting for all hell to break loose. </p> <p>As it happens, the stage is a central part of Blier's world these days. Ever since his groundbreaking 1974 drama, Les Valseuses (which launched Depardieu's career) the director's eclectic mix of caustic humour and sentimentality has produced international hits such as Preparez Vous Mouchoirs (awarded an Oscar for best foreign film), Tenue de Soir\u00e9e and Trop Belle pour Toi.</p> <p>It has now been a full four years since the director's last film, Mon Homme, starring his ex-muse Anouk Grinberg, which was a disappointing commercial flop. Only recently, after the rousing success of his satirical play, Les Cotelettes (The Cutlets), which he both wrote and directed, did Blier feel ready to contemplate a new project in cinema. </p> <p>\"I had this strange idea,\" Blier explains, puffing on his pipe between takes. \"I've always wanted to make a film on my profession - to show actors the way I see them when we work together. I thought it would be amusing to invent a story where they could finally play their own roles. Of course, it has nothing to do with their personal life,\" he adds. \"It's the legend, the myth, that interests me - how actors are able to penetrate into their audience's imagination.\" </p> <p>Not surprisingly, Blier's cast of \"veterans\", as he puts it, ranges from 50 years old to seventysomething. \"I chose this generation because it's my own,\" he explains, \"but also because the older they get, the funnier and more moving actors become. Their faces have been sculpted by life. They've finally mastered their art, but still act like a bunch of kids.\" </p> <p>He looks up distractedly at his four leading men at the table, whose off-camera banter has the 50-odd extras in evening dress tittering into their champagne glasses of watered-down apple juice. \"There's no message in this film - absolutely nothing for critics to interpret,\" Blier states with a provocative half-smile. \"Actually, I've been trying to come up with a reason for making it, but haven't found one yet. It's simply based on the desire to laugh with these actors.\" </p> <p>Indeed, the entire plot seems to revolve around a banal incident that occurs within the first few minutes of the film and quickly escalates into a major crisis. Jean-Pierre Marielle, a tall, greying, bearded man well-known to the French movie-goer, is sipping an espresso at La Maison du Caviar, and decides it's too strong. He orders a small jug of hot water, but it never arrives. He panics. His entire career is suddenly in jeopardy because the waiter has ignored him. \"The actor that nobody sees and nobody hears is a goner,\" says Blier. \"A weak delivery is his number one anxiety.\" </p> <p>Marielle disappears and drags a stranger into the restaurant to order the jug, which comes right away. A heated discussion ensues among these grumpy, oversensitive stars about the quintessential weaknesses that unite them. \"I drink,\" declares bug-eyed comic actor Jacques Villeret (Le Diner des Cons), known to have a penchant for alcohol. \"So does Depardieu,\" someone chimes in, and they nod in assent. But Marielle will not be comforted, and becomes so paranoid that he tries to convince Michel Piccoli that his wife is having an affair with the waiter who slighted him. </p> <p>Just how exaggerated is Blier's portrait? \"In the beginning, Blier told us nothing and there was no script,\" confides Andr\u00e9 Dussolier (Trois Hommes et un Couffin, Melo). \"We soon realised this was not really about us, but the obsessions an actor has on a set. I always worry about trying to do my best performance ever. The more films you make, the harder it gets.\" </p> <p>\"We try to invent,\" Michel Serrault says, \"but we're an endangered species. For the time being, we lie to ourselves, but someday 'real actors' will no longer exist. We'll be replaced by hi-tech special effects and animated monsters.\" </p> <p> Describing his film as a \"post-Bu\u00f1uel\" bordering on vaudeville, Blier has gleefully obliged his cast to indulge in their wildest dreams, no matter how puerile. Depardieu, who has a motorcycle crash on the Champs Elys\u00e9es, belligerently tells the cops off; Pierre Arditti attempts to strangle a gushy matron admirer who is trailing him; Jacques Fran\u00e7ois, an elderly distinguished character actor, holds up a restaurant and curses at the top of his lungs; Sami Frey steals the wheelchair of a legless war veteran and amuses himself in rush-hour traffic, feigning spastic convulsions. </p> <p>\"Whenever actors promote their films, they always say, 'Oh, it was marvellous', whether it was or not,\" Blier smirks. \"In this film, it's never marvellous. The actors continually ask each other: 'So, how are things?' and the answer is always the same. 'Terrible!' \" </p> <p>At the same time, he concedes that there's an inevitable power that comes with the profession. \"I purposely chose the restaurant La Maison du Caviar because I wanted to convey that actors live a charmed life - and it's true! I was once with Mastroianni in Venice and, as we were leaving Harry's Bar, he told me: 'Walk very quickly - otherwise, we're done for.' I was right behind him and watched the women fall down on their knees, left and right, as he crossed their path. That's also what an actor is, a superman.\" </p> <p>Curiously, this is one Blier film where homosexuality is a favourite topic of discussion, but women are never brought up. \"Because they have much more important problems!\" Blier laughs. \"Like the jug of water!\" </p> <p>In fact, only a handful of French actresses - such as Josiane Balasko, and the rarely-seen Maria Schneider of Last Tango in Paris fame - have been included in the script. Blier had originally envisioned making two separate films based on the same concept, but ultimately decided that a mockery of French actresses might be too problematic. \"We would have had to worry about the lighting, the make-up, who looked the prettiest... it wouldn't have been as funny.\" </p> <p>Behind all the cantankerous clowning, Les Acteurs has its dark moments. \"What kills actors is indifference!\" is the battle cry, and the only solution is to eliminate the jaded or ignorant movie-goer. The actors accost passers-by to ask their opinion on Patrick Dewaere, Blier's fragile hoodlum hero who committed suicide in 1982. An unsatisfactory response warrants death - one man is nearly shredded to pieces in the ventilator of an underground parking lot until he redeems himself by praising Depardieu. </p> <p>\"There is always some good and some bad in my characters,\" Blier contends. \"Take Les Valseuses - they were dreadful, but there was something endearing about them as well. Actors are special cases because of their egos. They're very tender and very mean, and have a hard time listening to others. It's better if they're the ones doing the talking.\" </p> <p>Blier should know. As the son of renowned actor Bernard Blier, he was always in their midst, though repeatedly told that acting was \"a horrible profession\". \"This film is a tribute to my father, he taught me everything,\" he says gravely. In the final scene, Blier plays himself, dressed in his habitual parka, jeans and checked cap, shooting a night scene on a deserted street. The crew starts up the rain machine, but the take is ruined because an actor has forgotten to switch off his mobile. \"It's for you,\" he says, passing the phone to Blier. \"Hello Papa,\" the director murmurs. The moment is magical, as if it were somehow perfectly normal that departed celluloid legends (Bernard Blier died in 1989) have privileged access to phones. </p> <p>What kind of reaction does Blier anticipate to this freewheeling itinerary through French actor's country? </p> <p>\"People always say I make black comedies,\" he smiles. \"Les Acteurs is more like a pink nightmare. I'm trying to film life, and you have to remain very modest behind the camera.\" A sigh escapes him. \"If only the audience has as much fun as we did...\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "As usual, the restaurant La Maison du Caviar, a spot noted for showbiz and film celebrities near the Champs Elys\u00e9es, is jam-packed with beautiful people. Michel Serrault (of La Cage aux Folles fame) steps into the plush, dimly-lit dining room, searches momentarily for his friends, then strides over to a table where fellow actors Andr\u00e9 Dussollier, Jacques Villeret and Jean-Pierre Marielle are feasting on blinis, smoked salmon and vodka. \"Did you save me the worst seat on purpose?\" he barks at them. \"There's obviously a hidden camera or you wouldn't all be sitting sideways, looking in the same direction!\" Ignoring their bewildered protests, Serrault is clearly in a foul mood and intends to make a scene. He turns his back to the group and straddles his chair, breathing down the neck of an elegant woman at the neighbouring table. \"There,\" he sighs dramatically. \"Now I'm in the picture too!\" \"Cut!\" says director Bertrand Blier, who can barely contain his laughter. This scene is just one among innumerable confrontations between a group of ageing male movie stars, who play \"themselves\" in Blier's latest dark comedy, Les Acteurs (The Actors). In a parade of France's biggest names in cinema, everyone from G\u00e9rard Depardieu and Alain Delon to Jean-Paul Belmondo and Michel Piccoli turn up unexpectedly in the film's free-floating intrigue, partly set on the streets of Paris. However, most of the real \"action\" - if you can call it that - takes place within the timeless red velvet walls of this famed restaurant, painstakingly reconstructed in the hangars of the Epinay studios. With its revolving door for entrances and exits, it's also the perfect theatrical setting for all hell to break loose. As it happens, the stage is a central part of Blier's world these days. Ever since his groundbreaking 1974 drama, Les Valseuses (which launched Depardieu's career) the director's eclectic mix of caustic humour and sentimentality has produced international hits such as Preparez Vous Mouchoirs (awarded an Oscar for best foreign film), Tenue de Soir\u00e9e and Trop Belle pour Toi. It has now been a full four years since the director's last film, Mon Homme, starring his ex-muse Anouk Grinberg, which was a disappointing commercial flop. Only recently, after the rousing success of his satirical play, Les Cotelettes (The Cutlets), which he both wrote and directed, did Blier feel ready to contemplate a new project in cinema. \"I had this strange idea,\" Blier explains, puffing on his pipe between takes. \"I've always wanted to make a film on my profession - to show actors the way I see them when we work together. I thought it would be amusing to invent a story where they could finally play their own roles. Of course, it has nothing to do with their personal life,\" he adds. \"It's the legend, the myth, that interests me - how actors are able to penetrate into their audience's imagination.\" Not surprisingly, Blier's cast of \"veterans\", as he puts it, ranges from 50 years old to seventysomething. \"I chose this generation because it's my own,\" he explains, \"but also because the older they get, the funnier and more moving actors become. Their faces have been sculpted by life. They've finally mastered their art, but still act like a bunch of kids.\" He looks up distractedly at his four leading men at the table, whose off-camera banter has the 50-odd extras in evening dress tittering into their champagne glasses of watered-down apple juice. \"There's no message in this film - absolutely nothing for critics to interpret,\" Blier states with a provocative half-smile. \"Actually, I've been trying to come up with a reason for making it, but haven't found one yet. It's simply based on the desire to laugh with these actors.\" Indeed, the entire plot seems to revolve around a banal incident that occurs within the first few minutes of the film and quickly escalates into a major crisis. Jean-Pierre Marielle, a tall, greying, bearded man well-known to the French movie-goer, is sipping an espresso at La Maison du Caviar, and decides it's too strong. He orders a small jug of hot water, but it never arrives. He panics. His entire career is suddenly in jeopardy because the waiter has ignored him. \"The actor that nobody sees and nobody hears is a goner,\" says Blier. \"A weak delivery is his number one anxiety.\" Marielle disappears and drags a stranger into the restaurant to order the jug, which comes right away. A heated discussion ensues among these grumpy, oversensitive stars about the quintessential weaknesses that unite them. \"I drink,\" declares bug-eyed comic actor Jacques Villeret (Le Diner des Cons), known to have a penchant for alcohol. \"So does Depardieu,\" someone chimes in, and they nod in assent. But Marielle will not be comforted, and becomes so paranoid that he tries to convince Michel Piccoli that his wife is having an affair with the waiter who slighted him. Just how exaggerated is Blier's portrait? \"In the beginning, Blier told us nothing and there was no script,\" confides Andr\u00e9 Dussolier (Trois Hommes et un Couffin, Melo). \"We soon realised this was not really about us, but the obsessions an actor has on a set. I always worry about trying to do my best performance ever. The more films you make, the harder it gets.\" \"We try to invent,\" Michel Serrault says, \"but we're an endangered species. For the time being, we lie to ourselves, but someday 'real actors' will no longer exist. We'll be replaced by hi-tech special effects and animated monsters.\" Describing his film as a \"post-Bu\u00f1uel\" bordering on vaudeville, Blier has gleefully obliged his cast to indulge in their wildest dreams, no matter how puerile. Depardieu, who has a motorcycle crash on the Champs Elys\u00e9es, belligerently tells the cops off; Pierre Arditti attempts to strangle a gushy matron admirer who is trailing him; Jacques Fran\u00e7ois, an elderly distinguished character actor, holds up a restaurant and curses at the top of his lungs; Sami Frey steals the wheelchair of a legless war veteran and amuses himself in rush-hour traffic, feigning spastic convulsions. \"Whenever actors promote their films, they always say, 'Oh, it was marvellous', whether it was or not,\" Blier smirks. \"In this film, it's never marvellous. The actors continually ask each other: 'So, how are things?' and the answer is always the same. 'Terrible!' \" At the same time, he concedes that there's an inevitable power that comes with the profession. \"I purposely chose the restaurant La Maison du Caviar because I wanted to convey that actors live a charmed life - and it's true! I was once with Mastroianni in Venice and, as we were leaving Harry's Bar, he told me: 'Walk very quickly - otherwise, we're done for.' I was right behind him and watched the women fall down on their knees, left and right, as he crossed their path. That's also what an actor is, a superman.\" Curiously, this is one Blier film where homosexuality is a favourite topic of discussion, but women are never brought up. \"Because they have much more important problems!\" Blier laughs. \"Like the jug of water!\" In fact, only a handful of French actresses - such as Josiane Balasko, and the rarely-seen Maria Schneider of Last Tango in Paris fame - have been included in the script. Blier had originally envisioned making two separate films based on the same concept, but ultimately decided that a mockery of French actresses might be too problematic. \"We would have had to worry about the lighting, the make-up, who looked the prettiest... it wouldn't have been as funny.\" Behind all the cantankerous clowning, Les Acteurs has its dark moments. \"What kills actors is indifference!\" is the battle cry, and the only solution is to eliminate the jaded or ignorant movie-goer. The actors accost passers-by to ask their opinion on Patrick Dewaere, Blier's fragile hoodlum hero who committed suicide in 1982. An unsatisfactory response warrants death - one man is nearly shredded to pieces in the ventilator of an underground parking lot until he redeems himself by praising Depardieu. \"There is always some good and some bad in my characters,\" Blier contends. \"Take Les Valseuses - they were dreadful, but there was something endearing about them as well. Actors are special cases because of their egos. They're very tender and very mean, and have a hard time listening to others. It's better if they're the ones doing the talking.\" Blier should know. As the son of renowned actor Bernard Blier, he was always in their midst, though repeatedly told that acting was \"a horrible profession\". \"This film is a tribute to my father, he taught me everything,\" he says gravely. In the final scene, Blier plays himself, dressed in his habitual parka, jeans and checked cap, shooting a night scene on a deserted street. The crew starts up the rain machine, but the take is ruined because an actor has forgotten to switch off his mobile. \"It's for you,\" he says, passing the phone to Blier. \"Hello Papa,\" the director murmurs. The moment is magical, as if it were somehow perfectly normal that departed celluloid legends (Bernard Blier died in 1989) have privileged access to phones. What kind of reaction does Blier anticipate to this freewheeling itinerary through French actor's country? \"People always say I make black comedies,\" he smiles. \"Les Acteurs is more like a pink nightmare. I'm trying to film life, and you have to remain very modest behind the camera.\" A sigh escapes him. \"If only the audience has as much fun as we did...\"",

      "body": "<p>Three years before King Kong, there was Ingagi. It was a real-life, documentary account in 1930 of an expedition into the Belgian Congo by somebody called Sir Herbert Winstead of London. </p> <p>Ingagi packed the US motion-picture halls. \"Has the Ape Man been Found?\" ran the ads in Chicago. \"Gorillas! Wild Women! Apparently Half Ape! Half Human!\" Crowds came especially for the last 10 minutes of the film, which purported to show a tribal sacrifice of a woman by native Africans to a 600lb gorilla. Variety reported that the \"suggestiveness\" of gorilla scenes guaranteed Ingagi a \"sure box office\". Congo Pictures Ltd sold the rights to RKO after the film grossed $23,000 in a week at one San Francisco cinema. </p> <p>The film offended American naturalists and the Hays Office - not because of the sexual innuendo or bestiality but because the gorilla scenes were quite obviously a compilation of stock orang-utan footage and a man in a gorilla suit. The film was faked at a zoo in California and the actresses were girls in what the showbiz trade used to call \"blackface\". The Chicago Tribune thought the cinematography so awful that it just had to be \"the real thing and not a staged adventure\". </p> <p>Gregg Mitman, a US science historian, tells the story in a new book called Reel Nature, which makes it quite clear: violence and sex win every time, and fakes beat reality any day. Merian Cooper and Ernest Schoedsack of RKO got the message of Ingagi, hired an actress called Fay Wray and an even bigger gorilla suit and set to work on the \"most awesome thriller of all time\". In 1933, they sold King Kong as fiction. </p> <p>But gorilla tactics began long before Ingagi. The first wildlife documentary was called Roosevelt in Africa. Made in 1910, it shows the great ex-president and naturalist Theodore Roose-velt planting a tree in Kenya, watching giraffes and hippos at play and the courtship dance of a bird. There is a scene with a serval cat, but the lion footage had to be spliced in from a still taken with a flashlight. It didn't play in Peoria. People expected to see Teddy the white hunter \"slaughtering lions and tigers and wallowing in their gore\". </p> <p>A Chicago entrepreneur called Selig went one better. He got someone to impersonate Roosevelt, faked a scene of a lion being shot and carried away by native porters, and had a success on his hands. \"There is no doubt about this lion,\" said the critic of Moving Picture World. \"He stalks majestically about the picture, thus enabling an audience to realise how a lion would look, not on the warpath, but peaceably ambling about among natural surroundings.\" </p> <p>That's natural history movies for you. Show life as it is, and the punters yawn. Fake some drama and you have a winner on your hands. The ultimate natural history movie - well, it is scripted and carefully cast and $800m was spent on the sound stage - is Disney's Animal Kingdom, in Florida. There, with the help of 1,000 animals, 100,000 transplanted trees and some African music on the loudspeakers, Disney's \"imagineers\" have synthesised the African veldt on the Florida flatlands: nature, this time round, as drama. </p> <p>The actors couldn't get more authentic; the theatre itself is the fantasy. How the wildlife documentary got from Roosevelt to Disneyworld is a story of charlatans, hucksters, crooks, imaginative cameramen, brilliant zoology and shameless appeal to the sex and violence of life as cinema audiences have grown to expect it to be. Mitman, of the University of Oklahoma, tells the American version of this lurid celluloid safari. The David Attenborough tradition of real naturalists and real film footage was born out of all this - and mostly ignored. Konrad Lorenz did something called The Ethology of the Greylag Goose. Alexander Korda and Niko Tinbergen, the scientist who inspired generations of zoologists, worked with John Grierson on The Private Life of the Gannet, which raked in a net profit of \u00a3220 after an 18-month run. One of Tinbergen's book spin-offs from his filmic career pursuing seabirds was marketed in the popular press as Sex and the Single Gull. </p> <p>The public wanted drama, tenderness, comedy, sex and violence - or at least a perm of any three from those five. Disney moved from Bambi and Thumper to apparently authentic crowd-pleasers of the True Life Adventure series such as Beaver Valley, Nature's Half Acre and The Living Desert. Hollywood, meanwhile, auditioned for Lassie and Rin Tin Tin. Even when the nature documentary grew up and got classy, the sales pitch carried on coarsely. Time-Life Video advertised Attenborough's The Trials of Life with a clip of killer whales snatching sea lion pups off the beach and the voice-over \"See up close how the law of the jungle is kill or be killed... find out why they call them animals!\" </p> <p>Mitman, born in 1960, grew up on films starring Flipper the dolphin and the underwater adventures of Jacques Cousteau.

      "bodyText": "Three years before King Kong, there was Ingagi. It was a real-life, documentary account in 1930 of an expedition into the Belgian Congo by somebody called Sir Herbert Winstead of London. Ingagi packed the US motion-picture halls. \"Has the Ape Man been Found?\" ran the ads in Chicago. \"Gorillas! Wild Women! Apparently Half Ape! Half Human!\" Crowds came especially for the last 10 minutes of the film, which purported to show a tribal sacrifice of a woman by native Africans to a 600lb gorilla. Variety reported that the \"suggestiveness\" of gorilla scenes guaranteed Ingagi a \"sure box office\". Congo Pictures Ltd sold the rights to RKO after the film grossed $23,000 in a week at one San Francisco cinema. The film offended American naturalists and the Hays Office - not because of the sexual innuendo or bestiality but because the gorilla scenes were quite obviously a compilation of stock orang-utan footage and a man in a gorilla suit. The film was faked at a zoo in California and the actresses were girls in what the showbiz trade used to call \"blackface\". The Chicago Tribune thought the cinematography so awful that it just had to be \"the real thing and not a staged adventure\". Gregg Mitman, a US science historian, tells the story in a new book called Reel Nature, which makes it quite clear: violence and sex win every time, and fakes beat reality any day. Merian Cooper and Ernest Schoedsack of RKO got the message of Ingagi, hired an actress called Fay Wray and an even bigger gorilla suit and set to work on the \"most awesome thriller of all time\". In 1933, they sold King Kong as fiction. But gorilla tactics began long before Ingagi. The first wildlife documentary was called Roosevelt in Africa. Made in 1910, it shows the great ex-president and naturalist Theodore Roose-velt planting a tree in Kenya, watching giraffes and hippos at play and the courtship dance of a bird. There is a scene with a serval cat, but the lion footage had to be spliced in from a still taken with a flashlight. It didn't play in Peoria. People expected to see Teddy the white hunter \"slaughtering lions and tigers and wallowing in their gore\". A Chicago entrepreneur called Selig went one better. He got someone to impersonate Roosevelt, faked a scene of a lion being shot and carried away by native porters, and had a success on his hands. \"There is no doubt about this lion,\" said the critic of Moving Picture World. \"He stalks majestically about the picture, thus enabling an audience to realise how a lion would look, not on the warpath, but peaceably ambling about among natural surroundings.\" That's natural history movies for you. Show life as it is, and the punters yawn. Fake some drama and you have a winner on your hands. The ultimate natural history movie - well, it is scripted and carefully cast and $800m was spent on the sound stage - is Disney's Animal Kingdom, in Florida. There, with the help of 1,000 animals, 100,000 transplanted trees and some African music on the loudspeakers, Disney's \"imagineers\" have synthesised the African veldt on the Florida flatlands: nature, this time round, as drama. The actors couldn't get more authentic; the theatre itself is the fantasy. How the wildlife documentary got from Roosevelt to Disneyworld is a story of charlatans, hucksters, crooks, imaginative cameramen, brilliant zoology and shameless appeal to the sex and violence of life as cinema audiences have grown to expect it to be. Mitman, of the University of Oklahoma, tells the American version of this lurid celluloid safari. The David Attenborough tradition of real naturalists and real film footage was born out of all this - and mostly ignored. Konrad Lorenz did something called The Ethology of the Greylag Goose. Alexander Korda and Niko Tinbergen, the scientist who inspired generations of zoologists, worked with John Grierson on The Private Life of the Gannet, which raked in a net profit of \u00a3220 after an 18-month run. One of Tinbergen's book spin-offs from his filmic career pursuing seabirds was marketed in the popular press as Sex and the Single Gull. The public wanted drama, tenderness, comedy, sex and violence - or at least a perm of any three from those five. Disney moved from Bambi and Thumper to apparently authentic crowd-pleasers of the True Life Adventure series such as Beaver Valley, Nature's Half Acre and The Living Desert. Hollywood, meanwhile, auditioned for Lassie and Rin Tin Tin. Even when the nature documentary grew up and got classy, the sales pitch carried on coarsely. Time-Life Video advertised Attenborough's The Trials of Life with a clip of killer whales snatching sea lion pups off the beach and the voice-over \"See up close how the law of the jungle is kill or be killed... find out why they call them animals!\" Mitman, born in 1960, grew up on films starring Flipper the dolphin and the underwater adventures of Jacques Cousteau. They set him off on a course of marine biology and then into the history of science, from which vantage point he began to see how movies had shaped his own attitudes towards nature. Meanwhile, out there in the real world, a huge tragedy is taking place. Most of the megafauna movie stars are being extinguished, or are surviving only in national parks and reserves. That is why he prefaces his book about nature on film with a visit to Disney's Animal Kingdom. \"There is something very troubling about what that says about our kind of relationship to nature,\" he writes. \"It may be the only way it can exist - that is the more chilling side. I remember hearing a story a couple of years ago. I was talking to primatologists about an effort to create a CD-rom library of primate behaviour, and the justification was so they could study these animals even when they had become extinct.

As the director himself pointed out, people leave his movies talking, arguing, fighting - provoked and enlivened by what they've seen. Plus, in Black and White you get to see Robert Downey Jr get bitch-slapped by none other than Mike Tyson. That's gotta be worth $7.50, unlike the shit-obsessed wrestling comedy Ready to Rumble at number six, which earned atrocious reviews all round, or Return to Me, a romantic comedy starring the ultra-bland David Duchovny and Minnie Driver, which I do not plan to endure. Bring on next weekend, which sees the release of Ridley Scott's Gladiator and Mary Harron's American Psycho. Colosseums and chainsaws...I like this menu already.",

      "bodyText": "Charles Saatchi refused Gordon Burn's request for an interview for this series, but agreed to answer a few questions by fax... Gordon Burn: \"Blame Charles Saatchi.\" That's what Damien says about the scale of the Stroud space and the empire he is very astutely building. Is there any element of competition between you? Charles Saatchi: No. GB: I've been told you see art history as going: Pollock - Warhol - Hirst. True? CS: Yes. GB: Where does the secret of Damien Hirst's genius lie? CS: On his pillow. GB: There were probably three cubists, four abstract expressionists, three pop artists. How many YBAs [young British artists] will there be? CS: Don't know. GB: What is the most recent gossip you've heard about Charles Saatchi? CS: He'd been shot dead in Miami. But it turned out that was Versace. GB: \"He just doesn't like anything to be said about him that isn't incredibly bland praise.\" [Art critic Matthew Collings] True? CS: True. GB: In your 1994 Turner Prize speech, you said young British art might be vulgar sometimes, but then aren't we all? When was the last time you were knowingly vulgar? Is driving a Roller vulgar? CS: a) Too often; b) Very. GB: \"Charles Saatchi really is the single most powerful force in the rise of British art, more than any artist.\" True or false? Is history, posterity and how you will come to be viewed something that looms large? CS: a) False; b) Who cares? GB: Would it make life a bit zestier if you had more competition in the marketplace? Do you still feel that there is virtually none? CS: a) Yes; b) Yes. GB: Saatchi, in Christopher Booker's prescient phrase, is a neophiliac: a perpetual gorger of the briefly new; a junkie for shift and change and forward propulsion. Is this how you see yourself? CS: Ghastly, but yes. GB: \"Charles is aware of the marketability of art,\" London dealer Victoria Miro has said. \"Other collectors want to hide that side of their activity.\" True? If so, why? CS: a) Yes; b) Don't know. GB: What is your feeling now about the Neurotic Realism show? Some have said they felt it was an attempt to launch a \"synthetic\" movement. CS: Good artists. GB: A number of the artists have complained to me about the tattiness of the press flyer sent out announcing Ant Noises. Why was it so cruddy? CS: Cruddy? Moi? GB: When did you last use public transport? CS: British Airways to New York.",
