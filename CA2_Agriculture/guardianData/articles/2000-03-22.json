      "body": "<p>The fragile nature of Manchester City's promotion challenge was further exposed last night when they were held to a draw by Stockport County, a team who have now not won for 15 matches, equalling an invidious club record. </p> <p>Joe Royle's team had themselves gone seven matches without a victory and his hopes that City had emerged from a lull after their draw against top of the table Charlton Athletic last Sunday were immediately proved premature. With a little more composure, and a goalkeeper less talented than City's Nick Weaver, Stockport could, and perhaps should, have won. </p> <p>Having not seen their team win since Boxing Day, County supporters were hoping this high-tension clash might finally proffer some much-needed inspiration. But there was not even time for perspiration before City were ahead. </p> <p>Mark Kennedy's surge down the left saw County's defence horribly stretched and it seemed Robert Taylor's pow erful header might have the beating of Carlo Nash before Jamie Pollock intervened to make absolutely sure. </p> <p>County's collective deflation was obvious, what bit of confidence they possessed before the kick-off leaking into the night sky. City strutted; City paraded. Expectations of another goal and a comfortable win were abundant. </p> <p>But this was a derby and gradually Stockport regrouped, revved themselves up and began to press hard and long as City's initial composure frayed at the edges. </p> <p>Stockport were beginning to believe in themselves and a brilliant through ball by Karim Fradin saw them equalise. City's defence had pushed up hard and Fradin's perceptive pass sent in Ian Moore with only Weaver to beat, which he did with ease. </p> <p>Stockport were transformed although it took a fine save by Nash to deny Pollock before Mike Flynn bundled in a Gibb corner just before half-time as the home side completely turned the first half around. </p> <p>On the hour City pulled off midfielder Ian Bishop and replaced him with the striker Paul Dickov in a desperate attempt to re-vitalise themselves, this after both Connelly and Moore might have put Stockport further ahead. </p> <p>Dickov's arrival had no immediate effect except to underline the feverish nature of City's response. But an injury to Stockport central defender James Gannon proved just a little too much for the home side to bear with Richard Jobson heading the equaliser from Edgehill's right wing cross ten minutes from time.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The fragile nature of Manchester City's promotion challenge was further exposed last night when they were held to a draw by Stockport County, a team who have now not won for 15 matches, equalling an invidious club record. Joe Royle's team had themselves gone seven matches without a victory and his hopes that City had emerged from a lull after their draw against top of the table Charlton Athletic last Sunday were immediately proved premature. With a little more composure, and a goalkeeper less talented than City's Nick Weaver, Stockport could, and perhaps should, have won. Having not seen their team win since Boxing Day, County supporters were hoping this high-tension clash might finally proffer some much-needed inspiration. But there was not even time for perspiration before City were ahead. Mark Kennedy's surge down the left saw County's defence horribly stretched and it seemed Robert Taylor's pow erful header might have the beating of Carlo Nash before Jamie Pollock intervened to make absolutely sure. County's collective deflation was obvious, what bit of confidence they possessed before the kick-off leaking into the night sky. City strutted; City paraded. Expectations of another goal and a comfortable win were abundant. But this was a derby and gradually Stockport regrouped, revved themselves up and began to press hard and long as City's initial composure frayed at the edges. Stockport were beginning to believe in themselves and a brilliant through ball by Karim Fradin saw them equalise. City's defence had pushed up hard and Fradin's perceptive pass sent in Ian Moore with only Weaver to beat, which he did with ease. Stockport were transformed although it took a fine save by Nash to deny Pollock before Mike Flynn bundled in a Gibb corner just before half-time as the home side completely turned the first half around. On the hour City pulled off midfielder Ian Bishop and replaced him with the striker Paul Dickov in a desperate attempt to re-vitalise themselves, this after both Connelly and Moore might have put Stockport further ahead. Dickov's arrival had no immediate effect except to underline the feverish nature of City's response. But an injury to Stockport central defender James Gannon proved just a little too much for the home side to bear with Richard Jobson heading the equaliser from Edgehill's right wing cross ten minutes from time.",

Early tussles for midfield superiority - where the home side will miss their influential skipper.<br><strong>3</strong> Inzaghi played through by Nedved and De Goey blocks well with his knees from 15 yards. Leboeuf collects the ricochet and clears.<br><strong>6</strong> Juan Veron collects on the right and with everyone in blue waiting for the through ball to Inzaghi, the Argentine drives a low, testing shot that De Goey does well to palm wide of his left-hand post. Mihajlovic takes the corner from the right, but the delivery is uncharacteristically poor and Chelsea are able to clear. <br><strong>8</strong> Lazio are enjoying having a dig at De Goey tonight. Nedved from 25 yards in a central position, hits it well but De Goey is always behind it. The Dutch keeper will have to have his wits about him during these opening moments.<br><strong>9</strong> Zola tries a repeat of last week as a ball aimed at Flo is headed out by Couto, but only as far as the diminutive Italian on the edge of the area. He waits patiently for the ball to come down and his volley is sweet. Marchegiani manages to divert the shot wide of his left-hand post.<br><strong>14</strong> Chelsea have carved out a couple of good chances, but Lazio are the ones with the urgency tonight, attacking down both flanks. Stankovic, sneaking unnoticed into the six-yard box, latches onto a Pancaro cross from the right. His header clears De Goey's crossbar, but only just.<br><strong>16</strong> Petrescu on the right by the half-way line, spots Poyet's run into the Lazio area. His lofted pass is an invitation to head goalwards, and Poyet obliges, but the effort is weak and straight at Marchegiani.<br><strong>22</strong> This game is descending towards a real physical battle, which is a shame considering the talent on display on both sides. Flo and Almeyda have shared a few spats and Leboeuf has just mentioned something inflammatory to Pancaro.<br><strong>26</strong> Corner to Lazio. Mihajlovic delivers from the right and Stankovic manages to head the cross back from the far post for Simeone, but the ball had just crossed the line. Goal kick.<br><strong>28</strong> A free kick for Lazio from 30 yards on the centre-left. The six-man Chelsea wall have the dubious honour of facing one of the hardest strikers of the ball in world football. Mihajlovic takes and De Goey gets his body behind the dipping shot, which is just as well as it bounces back off his chest and Babayaro hoofs it away from Inzaghi. Lots of Lazio pressure in the last ten minutes.<br> <strong>32</strong> Good interplay from Chelsea as Petrescu wins a corner from the right. Flo meets Zola's centre with a well directed header to Marchegiani's left-hand post. The keeper blocks well and in the resulting melee, Leboeuf, Couto and Simeone exchange words and shoves.<br><strong>33</strong> The football restarts after a brief hiatus during which Leboeuf and Couto were booked for their trouble.<br><strong>37</strong> Simeone, Veron, Nedved and Inzaghi all exchange tight passes in between Chelsea midfielders and defenders before Nedved's cross is misdirected to De Goey. Chelsea are having trouble putting their foot on the ball against this classy Italian outfit.<br><strong>40</strong> Zola, having intercepted a pass from Almeyda, plays Di Matteo through the middle. The Italian midfielder shapes to hit with his left, then cuts back onto the right and gently scoops the ball into Marchegiani's hands from 20 yards.<br><strong>42</strong> Best chance yet for Lazio to break the deadlock as Nedved finds some space on the right and crosses well into the centre of the Chelsea area where Inzaghi waits at the penalty spot.

Lazio: Marchegiani, Negro, Couto, Mihajlovic, Pancaro, Stankovic, Veron, Simeone, Almeyda, Nedved, Inzaghi. Substitutes: Ballotta, Sensini, Conceicao, Boksic, Salas, Mancini, Gottardi. Referee: Vitor Manuel Melo Pereira (Portugal) No British players in the starting eleven for Chelsea - skipper Dennis Wise injured in a training ground collision with Di Matteo yesterday. A draw may not be enough for Lazio tonight, so the game should be an open, attacking affair. 1 min Lazio kick off with Inzaghi leading the line and Salas warming the bench. Early tussles for midfield superiority - where the home side will miss their influential skipper. 3 Inzaghi played through by Nedved and De Goey blocks well with his knees from 15 yards. Leboeuf collects the ricochet and clears. 6 Juan Veron collects on the right and with everyone in blue waiting for the through ball to Inzaghi, the Argentine drives a low, testing shot that De Goey does well to palm wide of his left-hand post. Mihajlovic takes the corner from the right, but the delivery is uncharacteristically poor and Chelsea are able to clear. 8 Lazio are enjoying having a dig at De Goey tonight. Nedved from 25 yards in a central position, hits it well but De Goey is always behind it. The Dutch keeper will have to have his wits about him during these opening moments. 9 Zola tries a repeat of last week as a ball aimed at Flo is headed out by Couto, but only as far as the diminutive Italian on the edge of the area. He waits patiently for the ball to come down and his volley is sweet. Marchegiani manages to divert the shot wide of his left-hand post. 14 Chelsea have carved out a couple of good chances, but Lazio are the ones with the urgency tonight, attacking down both flanks. Stankovic, sneaking unnoticed into the six-yard box, latches onto a Pancaro cross from the right. His header clears De Goey's crossbar, but only just. 16 Petrescu on the right by the half-way line, spots Poyet's run into the Lazio area. His lofted pass is an invitation to head goalwards, and Poyet obliges, but the effort is weak and straight at Marchegiani. 22 This game is descending towards a real physical battle, which is a shame considering the talent on display on both sides. Flo and Almeyda have shared a few spats and Leboeuf has just mentioned something inflammatory to Pancaro. 26 Corner to Lazio. Mihajlovic delivers from the right and Stankovic manages to head the cross back from the far post for Simeone, but the ball had just crossed the line. Goal kick. 28 A free kick for Lazio from 30 yards on the centre-left. The six-man Chelsea wall have the dubious honour of facing one of the hardest strikers of the ball in world football. Mihajlovic takes and De Goey gets his body behind the dipping shot, which is just as well as it bounces back off his chest and Babayaro hoofs it away from Inzaghi. Lots of Lazio pressure in the last ten minutes. 32 Good interplay from Chelsea as Petrescu wins a corner from the right. Flo meets Zola's centre with a well directed header to Marchegiani's left-hand post. The keeper blocks well and in the resulting melee, Leboeuf, Couto and Simeone exchange words and shoves. 33 The football restarts after a brief hiatus during which Leboeuf and Couto were booked for their trouble. 37 Simeone, Veron, Nedved and Inzaghi all exchange tight passes in between Chelsea midfielders and defenders before Nedved's cross is misdirected to De Goey. Chelsea are having trouble putting their foot on the ball against this classy Italian outfit. 40 Zola, having intercepted a pass from Almeyda, plays Di Matteo through the middle. The Italian midfielder shapes to hit with his left, then cuts back onto the right and gently scoops the ball into Marchegiani's hands from 20 yards. 42 Best chance yet for Lazio to break the deadlock as Nedved finds some space on the right and crosses well into the centre of the Chelsea area where Inzaghi waits at the penalty spot. The Chelsea defence haven't picked him up and the header is powerful but the direction woeful. A real let-off for the home side. 44 GOAL Chelsea 1 - 0 Lazio Chelsea send Stamford Bridge into delirium. Poyet picks up the ball on the break in the centre circle after a great tackle by Deschamps to win possession.After two touches Gus drives a rising, swerving shot from 25 yards that clips the shirt of Negro on its way to the bottom corner. 45 Half time comes with the Bridge still singing Poyet's praises. 45 Lazio substitution: Boksic for Stankovic. 45 Chelsea restart and will brace themselves for an onslaught from the Italian side. Nedved starts brightly by pushing up with the ball from midfield. his shot is a disappointment, well wide on the right. 47 Boksic's first touch tonight is to lift the ball over an advancing De Goey, but agonisingly wide of the left upright. 49 Zola toys with Mihajlovic on the right-hand side of the Lazio area and eventually delivers a cross but Negro manages to clear as Poyet waited at the far post.

It is not going to be easy, as the company which organised the Cardiff congress has gone into liquidation with a significant slice of the senior high command of the CRE on its board, amid official allegations of inadequate financial and management control. </p> <p>Mr Singh, who has a strong reputation in local government as the modernising chief executive of Haringey council, has been asked by the home secretary, Jack Straw, to carry out an official inquiry into the collapse of the company: \"I want this review to be carried out properly, rigorously and it has got to be thorough. If it is seen to be a whitewash, if I can use that language, then there will be a fair degree of criticism and I am not in the business of cover-ups. It will be a fair and balanced investigation. It will try to establish the facts and I will need to make some form of assessment as to whether there is any culpability on anybody's part. </p> <p>\"I want this thing dealt with and out of the way because I do not want it to be a deflection from the proper business of the CRE,\" says Singh, adding that his inquiry report will be on Jack Straw's desk by the end of May. </p> <p>Having done one of the toughest jobs in local government seems to be a key qualification for a new chair of the CRE. His predecessor, Sir Herman Ouseley, had run the Inner London Education Authority and Lambeth council before he took up the job. Gurbux Singh has spent 11 years helping to turn round the particularly intractable problems of a London borough that includes the Broadwater Farm estate and has pockets of 70% young black unemployment. </p> <p>A Sikh born in the Punjab, India, whose family came to Britain in the 1950s when he was six, Singh grew up in Wolverhampton and took a degree at Sussex university. He is still a season ticket holder at Molyneux. He spent an early part of his career working at the community relations commission - which turned into the CRE - concentrating mainly on housing and local government, tackling building soc iety and estate agents who charged black and Asian people more expensive mortgages or adopted \"red lining\" practices which stopped them moving into white areas. </p> <p>Walking into the CRE's Victoria offices in London with Mr Singh it is immediately obvious that he is remembered from those days with genuine affection by the staff. </p> <p>But what of the future of the CRE? \"I believe this is the right time to be the chairman of the CRE. The political environment is right. I am not a card-carrying member of any political party but there is both leadership and commitment by this government to race equality...

If you believe in modern political institutions and modern public services you cannot modernise unless you look at the whole question of race and the composition of your communities.\" </p> <p>The post-Lawrence inquiry race relations (amendment) bill, now going through parliament, represents the first quantum leap forward in race equality legislation since the law setting up the CRE was passed in 1976. It does not include outlawing religious discrimination [see article opposite], but Mr Singh believes that the government will have to tackle that question sooner or later. </p> <p>The bill's provisions, making institutional racism illegal and placing a new legal duty on public bodies to promote equality, mean the CRE will have an even more important role. Mr Singh believes that will include ensuring ministers and senior civil servants see race equality as a mainstream component of the programme to modernise Britain. That includes not only Whitehall permanent secretaries but also local government, the health service and the police. </p> <p>\"The questions are what is the national framework around race equality and how do ministers and senior officials begin to put into place an equalities framework. Take the simple example of school exclusions and the educational under-achievement of Afro-Caribbean boys. To what extent is the Department for Education and Employment doing something meaningful about that? The CRE needs to enter into a dialogue with them about that. What is the DfEE doing about young blacks and unemployment? You know that 70% of kids in Tottenham who are Afro-Caribbean between the ages of 17 and 24 have never worked.\" </p> <p>Mr Singh says he believes the race equality debate in the private sector has moved significantly: \"But we are at the stage where there is a lot of positive declarations by captains - and others - of industry. What we are not doing anything about is actual delivery.

In the three major conurbations where the black communities are settled, Manchester, the West Midlands and London, the average minority ethnic unemployment rate is around 20%. \"So the private sector clearly has a very important role to play.\" But also conscious of the political attacks that the CRE has repeatedly faced during its lifetime, Mr Singh has another important priority: \"The one thing I want is for the CRE to be a centre of excellence that has legitimacy in the public eye. That the public actually believe the CRE is an important institution doing a valuable and meaningful job.\" </p> <p>He believes the recent Guardian/ICM survey showing that for the first time a majority of the British public regard racism as unacceptable was particularly encouraging and a good basis from which to build. </p> <p>What of his own record? Well, at Haringey some 48% of the workforce is drawn from black and minority communities, including the Irish: \"But the vast majority are located at the bottom end of the system.

Minority ethnic communities have not broken through at assistant director or director level. We want to address that. We did it by setting targets, and these are targets and not quotas, and we said if everything goes well we expect this to happen.

After a winter of crisis in Britain's hospitals, Mr Brown opened his brimming war chest to bring forward part of his planned summer spending round. He pledged a 35% real increase in funds for the NHS by 2004, the biggest sustained increase in its 52-year history. The first fruits of the chancellor's surprise announcement - the centrepiece of his fourth Budget - will be a sustained drive to recruit 10,000 more nurses and better intensive care, but Mr Brown emphasised that the extra cash would have to be matched by reform and modernisation of the NHS. To underline Labour's determination to recapture public confidence after sustained criticism of poor services and long waiting lists, Tony Blair will be taking personal responsibility for the NHS. The prime minister will make a Commons statement on health today explaining how he and the health secretary, Alan Milburn, will spearhead the public debate about the future of the NHS and ensure the government gets the best value for Mr Brown's billions. Last night the prime minister met healthcare professionals and told them that today he would be setting out plans to publish more tables highlighting the vastly different costs of operations from region to region, outlining increased powers for nurses and a further tranche of cash for preventive and primary care. The chancellor said the 6.1% a year real increase in spending was the reward for his disciplined handling of the economy, which he expects to grow robustly over the next three years despite the impact of the strong pound on manufacturing. With the economy in its ninth year of sustained growth, Mr Brown said he would have a budget surplus of \u00a312bn this year, \u00a315bn better than he expected a year ago.

New money we can provide because we have made our choice: a Budget that unites the whole country, a Budget for all our people,\" Mr Brown said. Treasury officials strongly denied that the chancellor had been panicked into a spending spree, although many at Westminster believed that the move reflected the direct intervention of the prime minister to twist Mr Brown's arm. While health was the most eye-catching announcement in the Budget, there was also an extra \u00a31bn for education, to allow David Blunkett to hand up to \u00a39,000 for primary schools and up to \u00a350,000 to secondary schools. More money for transport and combating crime mopped up the rest of Mr Brown's \u00a34bn boost to public spending, which dwarfed tax cuts of just over \u00a31bn. The British Medical Association, often critical of Mr Blair, led a chorus of delight from within the NHS. \"We are delighted that the government has responded so quickly to our call for a fundamental review of health service funding.

With the four-year programme for increased health spending already agreed, the education department was set to become the big beneficiary of the chancellor's comprehensive review of other Whitehall spending. \"Education will be the big selling point in the summer. So David is smiling. I can't see how this can do anything but help,\" one of Mr Blunkett's ministerial colleagues said last night. Education spending had been set to increase by \u00a33.5bn over the coming financial year and yesterday's Budget raised this to \u00a34.5bn. Health spending had been due to rise by only \u00a32.9bn, but overtook education as a result of the chancellor's statement to get an increase of \u00a34.9bn. However, education ministers said last night that they were not losing out because their increase over this year's budget was 8.5%, while health got 7.9%. The eventual outcome would depend on the comprehensive spending review, but gains made by the health department would strengthen arguments for spending more on education.",

The chancellor has again pulled off the political conjuring trick we are now getting used to. He is planning an almost unprecedented 6.1% annual increase in health spending - above the rate of inflation - for the next four years (plus an extra \u00a3 1billion for schools) while simultaneously tightening the fiscal stance (the balance between borrowing, spending and taxation) quite substantially by over 1% of of gross domestic product. He is sitting on Fort Knox in the form of a \u00a312 billion budget surplus - one of the biggest in history - but in practice he has had to put Scrooge's cap on because his largesse has been constrained by the need not to upset the City by spending too much at a time when the economy is in danger of overheating.</p> <p>On the first of the two tests on which we said this budget should be assessed - the need to boost spending substantially on health and education - he has come out with flying colours. But on the second _measures to bring down the over-strong pound - the jury is still out. The Treasury argues that it has already hugely tightened fiscal policy in recent years in the hope that this would take the pressure off the pound, but that has not worked. The problem, it believes, is the weak euro, not the strong pound, and when the EU economy awakens from its slumbers, as it is now showing signs of doing, the problem will sort itself out. Maybe. But until it does, the Treasury's prediction of a near 6% rise in export volume this year (compared with 2.5% last year) looks like wishful thinking.</p> <p>But even within his fiscal constraints Mr Brown has money to scatter around, thanks to lower debt interest payments, higher tax receipts and reduced outlays on social security. Small and medium-sized businesses will welcome his \u00a3225 million reduction in capital gains tax liabilities on business assets and a sheaf of other measures, including \u00a3280 million for a new all-employee share plan. He also promises to look at the problems of dot.com companies, worried about tax liabilities arising from share options on which their early success depends. Middle England will be relieved that the problems of the health service are to be tackled (after the neglect of Labour's first two years) even if they are not yet convinced that Mr Blair's target of matching European generosity is on the horizon.</p> <p>This was a Budget in which Labour threw itself as never before behind nurturing entrepreneurs, while also giving help to the poor - especially pensioners. Their increases, while hardly dramatic, are more generous than they look because they have been craftily targeted to help the really needy. Only a year ago, education was due to get more than health in this latest budget - an extra \u00a33.5 billion compared to health's \u00a32.9 billion. But since then the health service has been hit by flu and a winter crisis. Public support for Labour's handling of health steadily bled away in its first two years, but this last winter created a critical haemorrhage. Hence the prime minister's decision to intervene. He will speak more fully in the Commons today of Labour's new programme for the NHS, but the key injection - cash - was dealt with by the chancellor yesterday. Instead of an extra \u00a32.9 billion, the health service will receive \u00a34.9 billion for the financial year that starts in 10 days time - a 7.4% increase. This will be the first of four increases through to April 2004, averaging 6.1%. The health service has seen nothing like it. Its increases have averaged only 3.3% since its foundation and the last Conservative government averaged only 2.9%. True, the Tories pushed up spending by 9% in 1991 to save their `internal market'', but no government has achieved such a sustained level of investment. It is a health managers' dream, an opportunity to look and plan for the medium term rather than merely tomorrow. A health budget which was \u00a345.1billion only last year, will rise to \u00a368.7billion by April 2004 - a 50% increase in cash terms and a 35% increase in real terms. Sceptics will say that not even this huge investment will lift British health spending to the European average, as Mr Blair promised in January on the David Frost programme. They would be right, in that it is due to lift spending (both public and private) to 7.6% of GDP. But that is only 0.4% short of the crude European average.</p> <p>Although education has only received pounds 1bn extra compared to health's \u00a32 billion on this April's planned increases, education still achieved a higher proportionate rise: some 8%. There is no doubt that health is in a much sorrier state than education, so honour would be achieved by health receiving the bigger cash injection with education maintaining a higher proportionate rise. Headteachers were delighted not just with the extra funds but the method of distribution direct to the school. What was particularly welcome was the freedom for the schools to chose how the extra was spent: on books, technology or staff.</p> <p>There was much less excitement on the anti-poverty front, where the two previous budgets introduced the best deal for the poor for a generation. But earlier announcements were consolidated, with the New Deal's welfare-to-work programmes extended to long-term unemployed, older workers and lone parents. By the end of the next financial year 1 million children will have been lifted out of poverty and there are already plans to lift another million over three years through an integrated child credit. If that is achieved, the government will be on target to cut child poverty in half by 2010 - a new halfway house before the ultimate goal of complete abolition by 2020. One welcome new trend was the chancellor's readiness to point to the redistribution that Labour is achieving. Civic society is being renewed.</p> <p>Mr Brown, in sum, may have `given away' about as much as he could without frightening the City. Many people will still be understandably bemused as to why a chancellor sporting a record budget surplus, with more expected in coming years, cannot do even more to rectify the glaring deficiencies in health, education and transport. But within his self-imposed constraints, the chancellor has done himself proud.</p>",

After a winter of crisis in Britain's hospitals, Mr Brown opened his brimming war chest to bring forward part of his planned summer spending round. He pledged a 35% real increase in funds for the NHS by 2004, the biggest sustained increase in its 52-year history. The first fruits of the chancellor's surprise announcement - the centrepiece of his fourth Budget - will be a sustained drive to recruit 10,000 more nurses and better intensive care, but Mr Brown emphasised that the extra cash would have to be matched by reform and modernisation of the NHS. To underline Labour's determination to recapture public confidence after sustained criticism of poor services and long waiting lists, Tony Blair will be taking personal responsibility for the NHS. The prime minister will make a Commons statement on health today explaining how he and the health secretary, Alan Milburn, will spearhead the public debate about the future of the NHS and ensure the government gets the best value for Mr Brown's billions. Last night the prime minister met healthcare professionals and told them that today he would be setting out plans to publish more tables highlighting the vastly different costs of operations from region to region, outlining increased powers for nurses and a further tranche of cash for preventive and primary care.

Treasury officials strongly denied that the chancellor had been panicked into a spending spree, although many at Westminster believed that the move reflected the direct intervention of the prime minister to twist Mr Brown's arm. While health was the most eye-catching announcement in the Budget , there was also an extra pounds 1bn for education, to allow David Blunkett to hand up to \u00a39,000 for primary schools and up to \u00a350,000 to secondary schools. More money for transport and combating crime mopped up the rest of Mr Brown's \u00a34bn boost to public spending, which dwarfed tax cuts of just over \u00a31bn. The British Medical Association, often critical of Mr Blair, led a chorus of delight from within the NHS. 'We are delighted that the government has responded so quickly to our call for a fundamental review of health service funding. We see this as a first major step to putting the health service on a firm, long-term basis,' said its chairman, Ian Bogle.

Mr Brown announced a shake-up of capital gains tax, under which all business investment held for four years would be rewarded with a 10% rate a new all-employee share ownership scheme permanent 40% investment allowances for small companies and a regional network of venture capital funds worth pounds 1bn. He said these measures would make Britain the place 'for companies to start, to invest, to grow and expand'. Stressing his determination to tear down the barriers to full employment, Mr Brown said the working families tax credit to top up the incomes of the lowest paid would be increased to guarantee an income of \u00a3214 a week.

Reports this morning suggest that Adams has actually sold the rights to his tale of his battle against drink to Hollywood types. The Fiver is reliably informed that no deal has yet taken place, but that doesn't mean it's not going to happen.</p> <p>\"I've always seen it as a very cinematic story,\" Addicted's 'co'-author Ian Ridley told the Fiver today from his plush Bel Air beachside apartment (we think). \"It's very graphic, very realistic, and very redemptive,\" he went on - presumably referring to the bed-wetting scenes. \"Tony has been approached by several film companies, but he doesn't want to do anything until he's retired from the game.\" Expect Addicted in a cinema near you by Christmas.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>A PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT MADE BY A COMPANY WITH A VIEW TO PROMOTING THEIR GOODS AND SERVICES</strong></p> <p>Economist.com - Forthright opinion and lively analysis of global politics and business, plus handy summaries of the week's news. <a href=\"http://www.economist.com\"> www.economist.com</a></p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>NOW WE'RE PRESSURE COOKING</strong></p> <p>It's been coming for a while now. And today it finally happened. Yes, the simmering lid which has been precariously clattering on the rim of Alex Ferguson's head for nearly 20 years finally blew off thanks to a powerful jet of steaming invective. You see, Fergie has found out that people are irrationally jealous of Manchester United. That's what he's heard, anyway.</p> <p>\"You have to put all the criticism of this club down to jealousy,\" an enlightened Fergie told club magazine Pravda. \"The nation was warming towards us in the build-up to last season's Big Cup final,\" stated a man clearly suffering from fevered delusions, \"but the warmth was only ever going to be temporary.

Denise van Outen is looking on sympathetically] Robson: Can't you see I'm washed up as a professional footballer? If I can't kick this terrible boozing [takes swig from bottle] I may never lead my beloved Arsenal to double success! Denise: Ooh, innit terrible. [Cut to blurry close-up of 12-step program] Hot gossip from the world of celluloid entertainment (not a reference to staring at Vanessa Feltz's thighs, by the way): Tony Adams' heart-rending autobiography, Addicted, could make it to the silver screen. Reports this morning suggest that Adams has actually sold the rights to his tale of his battle against drink to Hollywood types. The Fiver is reliably informed that no deal has yet taken place, but that doesn't mean it's not going to happen. \"I've always seen it as a very cinematic story,\" Addicted's 'co'-author Ian Ridley told the Fiver today from his plush Bel Air beachside apartment (we think). \"It's very graphic, very realistic, and very redemptive,\" he went on - presumably referring to the bed-wetting scenes. \"Tony has been approached by several film companies, but he doesn't want to do anything until he's retired from the game.\" Expect Addicted in a cinema near you by Christmas. * * * * * * * * * * * * * A PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT MADE BY A COMPANY WITH A VIEW TO PROMOTING THEIR GOODS AND SERVICES Economist.com - Forthright opinion and lively analysis of global politics and business, plus handy summaries of the week's news. www.economist.com * * * * * * * * * * * * * NOW WE'RE PRESSURE COOKING It's been coming for a while now.

Yes, the simmering lid which has been precariously clattering on the rim of Alex Ferguson's head for nearly 20 years finally blew off thanks to a powerful jet of steaming invective. You see, Fergie has found out that people are irrationally jealous of Manchester United. That's what he's heard, anyway. \"You have to put all the criticism of this club down to jealousy,\" an enlightened Fergie told club magazine Pravda. \"The nation was warming towards us in the build-up to last season's Big Cup final,\" stated a man clearly suffering from fevered delusions, \"but the warmth was only ever going to be temporary. It's the British culture of being quick to put down the people at the top and we're a soft target.\" Ah, he's sounding better already. \"We're getting criticised for protesting yet we're in a society now where everyone is more confrontational,\" Fergie observed without any hint of irony. \"The statistics show that Manchester United are one of the best behaved teams in the country in spite of all the high-pressure games that we play in,\" he concluded with that irritating splutter of disbelief.

Buckyballs probably drifted into the solar system early on, bringing carbon and other material from far away. \"Most of the carbon in our bodies came from outside the solar system,\" said Ted Bunch of Nasa's Ames Research Centre in California. \"We're all aliens.\" Buckyballs, lacy-looking molecules made up of carbon atoms, are also known as fullerenes and are named in honour of Buckminster Fuller because they are shaped like the geodesic dome he invented. They can form on Earth but also are born outside our solar system, in hot areas of the universe such as the gas envelopes around embryonic stars. The buckyballs in question came in on the killer asteroid. The gas-carrying buckyballs were found in various parts of the globe, from North America to New Zealand to Denmark, in a layer of sediment laid down after an ancient asteroid impact. \"The buckyballs containing the gases arrived on Earth about 65 million years ago during an asteroid impact that scientists theorise ended the age of the dinosaurs,\" said Bunch. The impact of the big space rock may have killed the dinosaurs and most earthly life with its globe-girdling dust cloud, but the sturdy little buckyballs survived with their gaseous cargo intact, Bunch and his colleagues reported in the March 28 edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The article was available to subscribers on the Internet on Tuesday. Inside the buckyballs was a strange type of cosmic helium, along with other gases, Bunch said in a telephone interview. Helium created on Earth usually has four sub-atomic particles in its nucleus, while cosmic helium generally has only three, the scientists said. \"They're enriched helium 3,\" Bunch said. \"We know by the helium signature that it was formed probably outside the solar system... they've trapped them inside (the buckyballs) at the site of formation.\" This weird helium shows, as no other evidence has, that buckyballs can transport extraterrestrial gases without letting them escape on the way.

Gloria, Jed and Billy returned from their \"other home\" in their customary moods: sniffy, silent and over-stimulated respectively.

That'd really piss them off.\" </p> <p>Angie conceded that this did hold some appeal. But intercourse is one thing, conception something else, and Angie's menstrual calendar made the timing tricky. To have stood the slightest chance we'd have had to have gone at it there and then: feasible in theory, but lino can be awfully cold. </p> <p>We pondered our plight again a few days later on reverting to a family of three. There had, we reflected, been low-level shenanigans at Chez Pillock for some time. It is our year to have Gloria on her birthday, but that hadn't stopped Dilys trying to backslide on the deal. She had floated a proposal to split the day in two, with Gloria waking up in our house but returning to Chez Pillock after school - all this subtlely conveyed via Gloria, naturally. </p> <p>\"An interesting suggestion,\" I'd responded, innocently. \"And what would happen on the Friday evening?\" </p> <p>\"Oh, I don't know,\" Gloria had evaded, airily Dilys-like. \"Maybe I could go out to the pictures; maybe have some friends for a sleep-over.\" </p> <p>\"Nice idea,\" I'd agreed, pleasantly, boiling with rage on the inside. </p> <p>\"Trouble is, Angie and I have already made plans for your birthday night. Deadly secret ones, of course.\" </p> <p>No such plans existed. Gloomily I re-lived the exchange to Angie. Typically, she became inspired. \"We've got to top a kitten and a laptop. So give her the day off school. Take her to some shops. Buy her anything she wants.\" </p> <p>\"Anything?\" </p> <p>\"Oh, why not? Flashy frocks. Nail varnish. Unsuitable shoes. All the things Dilys doesn't approve of.\" </p> <p>I especially liked that last part. So the next time Gloria was with me I put the idea to her. And I threw in pizza and ice cream. Oh, and how about a visit to the cinema later on? To see the lovely Leo in The Beach? </p> <p>\"But that's a '15'!\" Gloria exclaimed. </p> <p>\"Oh, I'll sneak you in. And why not invite some friends? They can sleep over if they want.\" </p> <p>Of course, I don't much care for Leo and, nor does Gloria. But that isn't the point. The point is for Gloria to feel grown-up and me to put one over on Dilys and Chris The Pillock. They may prevail as providers of cute pets and portable computers, but when it comes to fostering improper behaviour, I'm the boss. </p> <p>\"Just think what they'll be like on Saturday morning,\" Angie mused. Oh yes: half a dozen girls in early adolescence staggering down for breakfast after a late night of giggling, shrieking and trying on each others' clothes. And just think of me on Saturday lunchtime dropping off Gloria on Chez Pillock's doorstep, all red-eyed and ratty in that certain way that so reminds me of her mother. Happy weekend Chris and Dilys!

      "body": "<p>The night on the town is a modern-day rite of passage. As children grow up, they go out. They get drunk, they have fights, they have sex. They do foolish things they may regret, but from which they will also learn. </p> <p>They leave you and their homework. The smell of sick in the bathroom may be the closest contact you get with them for weeks. They leave the security of the home for an unknown night world of hidden dangers and grasping strangers. </p> <p>They spurn your offers of a lift home and, particularly if they are boys, may even turn down the comparative safety of a taxi. According to statistics in the British crime survey, males under the age of 24 are more than twice as likely to be the victims of violent crime as women, but they are generally more blas\u00e9 about problems on the street. </p> <p>Antony Ionnu, 17, never uses cabs. He says: \"The prices are ridiculous, far out of the range of the average male teenager who has to buy beer as well.\" And why should they worry about cabs? Most don't regard getting home as an issue, as long as they're with other people. \"It's just not a hassle,\" says 14-year-old Bernard Taylor. Neither of them, or any of their friends, have ever been hurt. </p> <p>Eloise Millar, now 23, looking back on her own teenage nights on the town, thinks it's because girls have more to worry about: \"Boys tend to get into fights or get hassled for money and girls get hassled for sex.\" </p> <p>Eloise has had her fair share of run-ins with suspect men: \"I've had loads of flashers on the way home from clubs and men who get their willies out on buses.\" She is able to laugh these incidents off; none was very serious and she was with friends. </p> <p>That is not to say that getting home in the dead of night when drunk or even just tired is easy. Most public transport shuts down well before the clubs do. London at least has night buses, but they are notoriously infrequent and unpleasant. Everyone who uses them seems to have witnessed at least one scene of vomiting, violence, drug abuse or worse. </p> <p>Rachel Smith, 15, had a stomach-turning experience at 4am one morning on the 134 to Muswell Hill in north London. \"I was really tired and just wanted to go home when two guys got on. They'd obviously been drinking loads and started talking to some French girls behind me. The girls couldn't understand them, but they kept on all the same. I tried to explain and make them leave the girls alone, but they turned on me and started getting really aggressive. Then my friend's boyfriend threw a bottle of water on them. One guy tried to jump on him, but because he was really drunk he was just sick all over the place, including on my friend and her boyfriend. It was disgusting.\" </p> <p>Rachel and her friends jumped off when the bus stopped, and the doors closed in time to shut the vomiters on board. She recounts another occasion when she was approached by a man in Leicester Square who put his arm around her. She screamed, her friend jumped in front of him and the others made him run off. </p> <p>Rachel is fairly nonchalent about it. She says she has been in several similar situations, but it hasn't put her off, she explains: \"We normally only go out in big groups. We stick together and make sure we're all right.\" </p> <p>And there does seem to be some safety in numbers. The death last year of 17-year-old Ashleigh Robinson, is a frightening example of what can happen when friends are unable to take care of each other. Ashleigh was with a group who were returning home from a club in Guildford by hired coach. She became separated from her friends because she was thrown out of the club. While waiting outside in the cold she was picked up by a passer-by and found dead the next morning. </p> <p>Hearing stories like this, parents are bound to worry. Keren Smedley has had many arguments with her three children. \"My anxiety is often irrational, but I can't help it,\" she says. \"And things do go wrong. While kids say it can't happen to me, parents say it can. I've never wanted to feel, 'if only I had . . .' If I don't know where they are I will chase it up. There's a chance they could be lying in a ditch. If I chase it up, they won't be there as long.\" </p> <p> But perhaps we should give young people a little more credit. If they are allowed to, they really can look after each other. Ashleigh's friends had no idea where she was because no one told them she had been forced to leave. When it became apparent that she was not there, they raised the alarm, insisted on seeing CCTV footage from cameras outside the club and, when they did not show that Ashleigh was safe, they called the police. They were too late. Had the bouncers from the club notified Ashleigh's friends of her ejection they would have been able to look after her. </p> <p>Nights on the town are not without dangers but nor are most teenagers without sense. In a big group, one or two generally stay sober and, increasingly, carry mobile phones so they can make contact if the worst comes to the worst. The bright lights and bad people do not faze them. </p> <p>\"There's loads of weird people out there,\" according to 14-year-old Amy Burrows, but she and her friends stick together, sleeping over at each other's houses so that no one has to go home alone.

      "bodyText": "The night on the town is a modern-day rite of passage. As children grow up, they go out. They get drunk, they have fights, they have sex. They do foolish things they may regret, but from which they will also learn. They leave you and their homework. The smell of sick in the bathroom may be the closest contact you get with them for weeks. They leave the security of the home for an unknown night world of hidden dangers and grasping strangers. They spurn your offers of a lift home and, particularly if they are boys, may even turn down the comparative safety of a taxi. According to statistics in the British crime survey, males under the age of 24 are more than twice as likely to be the victims of violent crime as women, but they are generally more blas\u00e9 about problems on the street. Antony Ionnu, 17, never uses cabs. He says: \"The prices are ridiculous, far out of the range of the average male teenager who has to buy beer as well.\" And why should they worry about cabs? Most don't regard getting home as an issue, as long as they're with other people. \"It's just not a hassle,\" says 14-year-old Bernard Taylor. Neither of them, or any of their friends, have ever been hurt. Eloise Millar, now 23, looking back on her own teenage nights on the town, thinks it's because girls have more to worry about: \"Boys tend to get into fights or get hassled for money and girls get hassled for sex.\" Eloise has had her fair share of run-ins with suspect men: \"I've had loads of flashers on the way home from clubs and men who get their willies out on buses.\" She is able to laugh these incidents off; none was very serious and she was with friends. That is not to say that getting home in the dead of night when drunk or even just tired is easy. Most public transport shuts down well before the clubs do. London at least has night buses, but they are notoriously infrequent and unpleasant. Everyone who uses them seems to have witnessed at least one scene of vomiting, violence, drug abuse or worse. Rachel Smith, 15, had a stomach-turning experience at 4am one morning on the 134 to Muswell Hill in north London. \"I was really tired and just wanted to go home when two guys got on. They'd obviously been drinking loads and started talking to some French girls behind me. The girls couldn't understand them, but they kept on all the same. I tried to explain and make them leave the girls alone, but they turned on me and started getting really aggressive. Then my friend's boyfriend threw a bottle of water on them. One guy tried to jump on him, but because he was really drunk he was just sick all over the place, including on my friend and her boyfriend. It was disgusting.\" Rachel and her friends jumped off when the bus stopped, and the doors closed in time to shut the vomiters on board. She recounts another occasion when she was approached by a man in Leicester Square who put his arm around her. She screamed, her friend jumped in front of him and the others made him run off. Rachel is fairly nonchalent about it. She says she has been in several similar situations, but it hasn't put her off, she explains: \"We normally only go out in big groups. We stick together and make sure we're all right.\" And there does seem to be some safety in numbers. The death last year of 17-year-old Ashleigh Robinson, is a frightening example of what can happen when friends are unable to take care of each other. Ashleigh was with a group who were returning home from a club in Guildford by hired coach. She became separated from her friends because she was thrown out of the club. While waiting outside in the cold she was picked up by a passer-by and found dead the next morning. Hearing stories like this, parents are bound to worry. Keren Smedley has had many arguments with her three children. \"My anxiety is often irrational, but I can't help it,\" she says. \"And things do go wrong. While kids say it can't happen to me, parents say it can. I've never wanted to feel, 'if only I had . . .' If I don't know where they are I will chase it up. There's a chance they could be lying in a ditch. If I chase it up, they won't be there as long.\" But perhaps we should give young people a little more credit. If they are allowed to, they really can look after each other. Ashleigh's friends had no idea where she was because no one told them she had been forced to leave. When it became apparent that she was not there, they raised the alarm, insisted on seeing CCTV footage from cameras outside the club and, when they did not show that Ashleigh was safe, they called the police. They were too late. Had the bouncers from the club notified Ashleigh's friends of her ejection they would have been able to look after her. Nights on the town are not without dangers but nor are most teenagers without sense. In a big group, one or two generally stay sober and, increasingly, carry mobile phones so they can make contact if the worst comes to the worst. The bright lights and bad people do not faze them. \"There's loads of weird people out there,\" according to 14-year-old Amy Burrows, but she and her friends stick together, sleeping over at each other's houses so that no one has to go home alone. What unwanted attention they have received, they have been able to cope with as a group. \"We have been approached by old blokes saying dirty stuff,\" says Amy \"but we've been together. You just ignore them. I really can't remember anything too bad happening. We were even followed by two people once, but my friends got lairy and argued with them till they went away.

But with Lucy Daniels he struck gold. </p> <p>\"Vets and animals were becoming extremely popular on TV,\" says Baglio, \"and I had the idea of this idealised setting that harked back to those non-existent golden days when everyone knew each other, but nobody pried. I also had in mind a middle-American view of England as thatched cottages, but without the caricature, as I thought this might attract US sales.\" </p> <p>The idea that emerged was Animal Ark, featuring Mandy Hope, the daughter of two vets, who goes round solving crimes and injustices against unsuspecting members of the animal kingdom. But books don't write themselves, so Baglio and Ritchie turned to Lesley Hadcroft of Laurence Pollinger, one of the best-known agents for children's books, to tap into her stable of authors. </p> <p>\"Ben appeared with a brief that ran to a couple of sides of A4 and an advance of \u00a31,200 per book,\" says Hadcroft. \"Together we commissioned the first six titles.\" </p> <p>The list of Animal Ark authors reads like a Who's Who of children's fiction. Sue Welford, a Whitbread prize nominee, Jenny Oldfield and Helen Magee, all of whom are names in their own right, have done a turn as Lucy Daniels. In Jenny Oldfield's case, she has done dozens of turns, and the reason is simple: money. A three-to-four-week spell spent writing a 25,000-word Animal Ark manuscript can net the author over \u00a320,000 in royalties and foreign rights. </p> <p>The name Lucy Daniels was chosen extremely carefully. \"We wanted the author to be a woman, so we took the name Lucy from one of the editors at Hodder,\" says Baglio. \"The name Daniels was used to position ourselves next to Colin Dann, author of The Animals of Farthing Wood, on the bookshelves.\" </p> <p>Initially, the strategy backfired as sales were disappointing. \"Our original jackets featured Mandy and a furry animal,\" says Baglio. \"We decided to dispense with Mandy and make the animals much larger. We got in the artist who drew the cat on the Go-Kat packaging and he created some brilliant images.\" </p> <p>Since then there has been no looking back. In addition to Animal Ark, there are now Animal Ark Pets, the stories of some of the original animals when they were small, Animal Ark Hauntings, ghost stories with positive messages, Little Animal Ark, for younger readers, Perfect Ponies and Nine Lives.

On a dozen measures ranging from real income to educational attainment, from rates of maternity pay to the quality and affordability of childcare, Britain bumps along behind not only Scandinavia and other prosperous northern European countries, but also the struggling economies of Portugal and Greece. </p> <p>The chancellor Gordon Brown, as he reminded us again yesterday, doesn't like the figures about childhood poverty that keep leaving their grubby prints on his glistening economic record. He's committed to erasing forever the headline \"Britain bottom of the table for child well-being\" (last week's, but it could have been written at any time in the past 20 years). But yesterday's budget is unlikely to help much. </p> <p>Ruth Lister, professor of social policy at Loughborough University, pointed out that budgets are about priorities, and family poverty was clearly not as high as had been hoped: \"So much more could have been done if we weren't spending \u00a33bn on cutting the basic rate of tax.\" </p> <p>Having a baby in Britain continues to be like playing one of those Victorian games of snakes and ladders. Every throw of the dice takes you to another lesson in morality. For one family in six, it means stepping off the ladder marked \"job and security\" and into the jaws of the snake marked \"baby and poverty\" - less income, more outgoings, and an uncertain future at work. </p> <p>As last week's headlines confirmed, there is still much more to be done before we reach a place where parents can make real choices about how to balance caring and working, where, for example, benefits will allow a mother to take a year off with her baby and still go back to her old job, where both parents are entitled to paid leave in the early years and can work sensible hours later on, and where affordable, good quality childcare is not an issue because it's there. </p> <p>Yesterday barely took us within shouting distance of Scandinavia. Buried in the dense Treasury-speak there was an announcement of extra cash for the first six months after the birth of a baby - but only for those new mothers on Working Families Tax Credit. The change was welcomed by Harriet Harman, who's still a frequent visitor to the chancellor's spacious office. There was a promise of a review of arrangements for maternity pay and leave, and family-friendly working policies, and an extra \u00a3100 on the means tested maternity grant - raising it to \u00a3300. (The Maternity Alliance says it needs to be at least twice that). Finally a new Children's Tax Credit is to be introduced to replace the Married Man's Allowance - something long campaigned for - but sadly a year's gap has been left between the abolition of one and the start of the other. </p> <p>The trade secretary Stephen Byers will now have to try to find a balance between demands from women, who would like to be able to afford to stay home longer and return part time, and business which has flatly rejected paid parental leave and still appears cool about reforming work practices. </p> <p>There was more enthusiasm for the extra investment in the New Deal for Lone Parents (underfunded compared with all the other New Deals) which will at last boost training opportunities and help to get women into jobs that will last, at rates of pay that make working viable. And there was a shoal of small increases in benefits which will help the least well off. </p> <p>To most chancellors, we are all economic units. Gordon Brown is no different. His policies, endorsed by research summarised in a Treasury paper last autumn, are about making us more efficient. The research, which the chancellor referred to again yesterday, confirmed the poverty spiral: children born and raised in poverty are much more likely themselves to be poor, to be convicted of a criminal offence, or to become a teenage mother. Having children can condemn women to poverty in old age: the longer they are out of the job market, the harder it is to get back in; lacking the opportunity to stay in the job market, they miss out on access to pension supplements and in old age have only the basic state pension to rely on. And the poor tend also to live in areas with worse schools, an over-stretched health service and to experience worse housing. </p> <p>So the answer is to make it worthwhile, feasible and not too complicated to get back to work, which in turn means children will be better provided for in a better and more positive environment. That is at the heart of the latest big idea: the Integrated Child Credit. This consolidation of all benefits and tax allowances for children, providing a fixed and predictable income bridging the difficult transfer from benefit to work, was announced in the pre-budget report in the autumn. There was fevered speculation that it would be fleshed out yesterday. Instead it was dismissed in a couple of lines with a promise that it would be introduced in the next three years. </p> <p>This suggests that no way has been found round the problem of trying to decide how to calculate it. Should it be based on combined family income or calculated on the income of the highest earner? The former provides better targeting at low-income families but would spell the end of independent taxation. </p> <p>It was another bad day for universal benefits, the glue, many people still believe, of a cohesive society. With only a small increase in Child Benefit, there are indications that the Treasury is ready to allow it to wither in favour of the more targeted Integrated Child Credit. </p> <p>\"There are some good things,\" said Mary-Ann Stephenson, director of the Fawcett Society, who spent the afternoon with the Women's Budget Group. \"At least there weren't more tax cuts and there was a massive boost for health and education, which have a powerful impact on the lives of women and children.\" </p> <p>No one doubts Gordon Brown's determination to tackle poverty. He is not shy of using the tax and benefits system for social as well as economic ends. But it seems right now he is not ready with the next step. That much more time then, to pursuade him of what it should be.</p>",

Finally a new Children's Tax Credit is to be introduced to replace the Married Man's Allowance - something long campaigned for - but sadly a year's gap has been left between the abolition of one and the start of the other. The trade secretary Stephen Byers will now have to try to find a balance between demands from women, who would like to be able to afford to stay home longer and return part time, and business which has flatly rejected paid parental leave and still appears cool about reforming work practices. There was more enthusiasm for the extra investment in the New Deal for Lone Parents (underfunded compared with all the other New Deals) which will at last boost training opportunities and help to get women into jobs that will last, at rates of pay that make working viable. And there was a shoal of small increases in benefits which will help the least well off. To most chancellors, we are all economic units. Gordon Brown is no different. His policies, endorsed by research summarised in a Treasury paper last autumn, are about making us more efficient. The research, which the chancellor referred to again yesterday, confirmed the poverty spiral: children born and raised in poverty are much more likely themselves to be poor, to be convicted of a criminal offence, or to become a teenage mother. Having children can condemn women to poverty in old age: the longer they are out of the job market, the harder it is to get back in; lacking the opportunity to stay in the job market, they miss out on access to pension supplements and in old age have only the basic state pension to rely on. And the poor tend also to live in areas with worse schools, an over-stretched health service and to experience worse housing. So the answer is to make it worthwhile, feasible and not too complicated to get back to work, which in turn means children will be better provided for in a better and more positive environment. That is at the heart of the latest big idea: the Integrated Child Credit. This consolidation of all benefits and tax allowances for children, providing a fixed and predictable income bridging the difficult transfer from benefit to work, was announced in the pre-budget report in the autumn. There was fevered speculation that it would be fleshed out yesterday. Instead it was dismissed in a couple of lines with a promise that it would be introduced in the next three years. This suggests that no way has been found round the problem of trying to decide how to calculate it. Should it be based on combined family income or calculated on the income of the highest earner? The former provides better targeting at low-income families but would spell the end of independent taxation. It was another bad day for universal benefits, the glue, many people still believe, of a cohesive society. With only a small increase in Child Benefit, there are indications that the Treasury is ready to allow it to wither in favour of the more targeted Integrated Child Credit. \"There are some good things,\" said Mary-Ann Stephenson, director of the Fawcett Society, who spent the afternoon with the Women's Budget Group. \"At least there weren't more tax cuts and there was a massive boost for health and education, which have a powerful impact on the lives of women and children.\" No one doubts Gordon Brown's determination to tackle poverty. He is not shy of using the tax and benefits system for social as well as economic ends. But it seems right now he is not ready with the next step. That much more time then, to pursuade him of what it should be.",

      "body": "<p><strong>The Elegant Universe: Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory</strong> by Brian Greene (Vintage, 448 pp., \u00a37.99) <br> <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502364947,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a> </p> <p>The great ambition of scientists is to grasp the far from obvious nature of the physical world at ever more fundamental levels, and in doing so, to unify our understanding of phenomena that had previously appeared to be disparate. We have been enormously successful in this, demonstrating that complex objects are made from simpler components, and they in turn are made of even simpler ones. Everything around us, ourselves included, is composed of molecules, which are composed of atoms - carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and so on - which are composed of negatively charged electrons, and a nucleus of positively charged protons and uncharged neutrons, which are composed of quarks. Thus underlying the immense complexity of life is a simplicity of microscopic composition.</p> <p>The way in which these various particles combine and interact is controlled by just four fundamental forces: the electromagnetic force, which unifies electricity and magnetism and is the common basis of light, radiowaves and X-rays (all now identified as electromagnetic waves); the gravitational force, which as well as causing things to fall onto the floor, causes the planets to move around the sun and galaxies round each other; the weak nuclear force, which is responsible for hard-to-detect effects such as the radioactive decay of neutrons into protons and electrons; and the strong nuclear force, which holds the protons and neutrons in the nucleus of an atom together, thus making it stable despite the electrical repulsion between the protons that tends to rip it apart.</p> <p>It has taken centuries to arrive at the amazingly successful understanding of the structure of the physical world that we now have, whose basic feature is the law-like descriptions we can give of the behaviour of matter, testable in detail by experiments. These laws are formulated mathematically, enable us to make quantitative predictions, and are universal inasmuch as they are believed to apply to all matter at all times and in all places. If we discovered matter that didn't obey them, that would signal that we needed to modify our understanding and look for more general relationships still. </p> <p>Our understanding of both particles and the forces involved in their interactions has evolved in response to ever more refined data from experiments. In particular, the question of whether, at its most fundamental level, matter behaves in a 'wave-like' or 'particle-like' way has been a source of continuing puzzlement. Our present belief, based in quantum theory (the theory that describes the behaviour of matter at very small scales), is that, at sub-atomic levels, matter isn't either wave-like or particle-like in nature but both, depending on the circumstances, and behaves unpredictably in a manner quite unlike anything we are familiar with in everyday life.</p> <p>Our ideas about forces have also undergone a major evolution, from being thought of as simply constituting the direct action of one object on another, either through contact or at a distance, then as being mediated by the effects of various 'fields' pervading space and time - e.g. the electromagnet ic field that currents and magnets generate, exerting forces on charged particles - and finally to being understood as involving the exchange of force-carrying particles, photons in the case of electromagnetism, gluons in the case of the strong nuclear force. </p> <p>Forces and particles, then, are not as distinct from each other as was once thought. Additionally, it seems now that not even the four 'fundamental' forces are independent of each other, but that the electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces are in fact different aspects of a single, more fundamental force, which would have functioned as a single interaction in the very early days of the Universe but appears under present-day conditions to comprise separate forces. Attempts to include the strong nuclear force also in this unifying scheme are well advanced.</p> <p>Even our understanding of space and time has evolved, these formerly distinct concepts now being understood as separate aspects of a single four-dimensional space-time continuum. This has two quite different sets of implications. On a large scale, gravity (which controls the evolution of the Universe) is now seen as being caused by the curvature of four-dimensional space-time, and as able to convey energy over vast distances by means of gravitational waves. On very small scales, when combined with quantum theory, it implies an equivalence between mass and energy (i.e. E = mc<sup>2</sup>), as evidenced in such nuclear reactions as those that power the radiance of the sun, and predicts the existence of anti-particles, which produce enormous amounts of energy when they annihilate with their corresponding particles - when an electron and its anti-particle, the positron, collide, for example, the result is pure radiation, emitted in the form of two high-energy photons; the particles then no longer exist. This in turn has led to a major revision of the concept of a 'vacuum' - understood nowadays not as an emptiness with nothing happening in it, but as a seething sea of particle and anti-particle pairs continually coming into existence and annihilating. All of this follows from the unification of relativity theory and quantum theory, two of the great intellectual achievements of this century. </p> <p>Despite all these advances, however, there are still great gaps to be filled in. The quest now is for an even more fundamental theory that would unify gravitation and quantum theory - something that has so far eluded us. The hope is that such a theory would also include the other three fundamental forces in a single scheme, and show them to be simply different aspects of a single 'super-force', explaining into the bargain many properties of fundamental particles that at the moment appear somewhat arbitrary.</p> <p>The most promising attempts made to date have given us the family of what are known as Superstring theories, in which our ideas of both particles and of space-time are revised in an astonishing way. According to Superstring theorists, our perceived four-dimensional space-time has to be seen as only an approximation to a ten or eleven-dimensional space-time, with the other six or seven spatial dimensions rolled up so small that they are indistinguishable from a point. On top of which, particles are no longer to be seen as point-like objects, but rather as patterns of vibrations of extended two-dimensional objects like strings or ribbons; thus electrons and quarks, for example, would be made up of vibrating Superstrings.</p> <p>This whole structure is subject to so-called 'Supersymmetry', whereby kinds of particle with apparently quite different properties are found to be related to each other and indeed may be transformed into each other under certain circumstances. For this method of unification to work, we need to identify symmetries in the inter actions re presented by (often hidden) similarities in the laws of physics. A simple example: if a physical system's interactions are constant in time, then its dynamical properties are the same at later times as they were at earlier times, and its energy is conserved; if the system's interactions are constant in space, then its momentum is conserved. And just as it's possible to represent mathematic ally the symmetries involved in the rotations of a solid object (a cube, say) that move it in such a way as to leave it exactly where it was but with the different faces rotated into each other, so we can represent the relation between families of fundamental particles in terms of abstract rotations that transform them into each other. Realising this has enabled physicists to predict the existence of previously unknown types of particle, which are required if we're to complete the symmetry patterns. Experimental proof of their existence has been a major vindication of this form of analysis.</p> <p>Up until quite recently, there were five alternative Superstring theories on offer, each with somewhat different symmetries, but this has now become an area of much excitement, as new unifications are achieved between models previously seen as distinct, suggesting that there may be only one theory that encompasses and unifies all of the others. The excitement came about with the discovery by the American theoretical physicist, Edward Witten, of previously undetected further sets of symmetries (or 'dualities'), which link various parts of the theory, in particular its reasonably well- understood low-energy aspects to the rather ill-understood high-energy ones, where it's not even clear how to formulate the theory. This should help us to understand 'strong-coupling' behaviour, which occurs when the interactions in a physical system are in tense because the energies involved are high, and which has hitherto been inaccessible because we don't know how to solve the immensely complex relevant equations. We can now do this by using one of the new symmetries to compare strong-coupling behaviour with the corresponding properties in a 'weak-coupling' regime, where the interactions are weak and thus easy to analyse. As the hype would have it, the discovery of these theoretical structures may mean we can one day complete the physicists' ultimate dream - a Theory of Everything (TOE) that will explain the behaviour of all the fundamental particles and forces in a single framework. </p> <p>In The Elegant Universe, Brian Greene guides us through these fundamental ideas and recent developments in as full and comprehensible a way as is possible without going into the exceedingly difficult mathematics involved. He aims to explain many of the central ideas of Superstring theories by means of analogy and explanatory diagrams rather than equations, and I can only say that his book is an explanatory tour de force.</p> <p>He starts with the basic ideas of relativity and quantum theory, explaining why these need to be unified, and then moves onto Superstrings. Here he goes into detail about the notion of 'quantum spin' (a microscopic version of the spin that can be put on a tennis ball) that separates particles into two distinct families: matter particles, which spin at one speed, and force-carrying particles that either don't spin or spin twice as much, but four times as much when the force is gravitational. He next shows how the theory of Supersymmetry connects these two families of particles and in so doing predicts the existence of many new part icles which we've yet to detect. From there, Greene goes on to the strange idea that the Universe may have more dimensions than meet the eye, may have 'both extended and curled-up dimensions'. The hope that we will be able to unify existing physical theories by means of these extra dimensions follows from ideas originally introduced by Theodor Kaluza and Oskar Klein, who suggested that space-time was really five rather than four-dimensional, the postulated fifth dimension carrying the electric and magnetic fields.</p> <p>Superstring theory in fact requires the Universe to have no fewer than nine spatial dimensions. The question then arises of why the three of them we are familiar with should be large and the other six so small as to be unnoticeable. Another problem arises from the extraordinarily complex structure that these curled-up dimensions are required to have: they are connected together in a contorted topology that is extremely difficult to describe. Nevertheless, the theory holds that they 'are an integral and ubiquitous part of the spatial fabric: they exist everywhere'. </p> <p>Greene is now at the point where he can deliver the final, astonishing, unifying vision:</p> <p>\"From one principle - that everything at its most microscopic level consists of combinations of vibrating strands - string theory provides a single explanatory framework capable of encompassing all forces and all matter... The observed particle properties... are a reflection of the various ways in which a string can vibrate... Force particles are also associated with particular patterns of string vibration, and hence everything, all matter and all forces, is unified under the same rubric of microscopic string oscillations - the 'notes' that a string can play.</p> <p>This result necessitates the existence of an infinite number of other particles in addition to those we've detected so far, but almost all of them will have to be so massive that we cannot now, nor indeed will be able ever, to achieve experimentally the energies that would be required to observe them.</p> <p>Greene comes right up to date by describing the dualities that tie the various aspects of string theory into a unity (the so-called 'M theory'), and discusses the way this can be used to calculate properties of black holes, before speculating about how it might all relate to cosmology. In particular, the theory has been used to calculate the number of physic al states that are no longer accessible to an observer because they are hidden behind the 'horizon' of a black hole. This calculation serves to confirm in an interesting way the idea first discovered by Bekenstein and Hawking, that when they collapse, massive astrophysical objects create a black hole which has remarkable thermodynamic properties, similar to those of ordinary thermodynamics - thus linking quantum theory, gravitational theory and thermodynamics in a way never before achieved.</p> <p>It would be hard to imagine anyone producing a clearer account than this of the difficult ideas involved, and Greene even brings out something of the actual excitement of scientific discovery when he recalls his own role in exploring some of the remarkable changes of structure that can occur in the topology of the new nine-dimensional space sections.</p> <p>Having said this, a word or two of caution is in order. First, Superstring theory is still far from complete; it is in many ways as yet simply a set of suggestions of the way things might be, rather than a well- developed theory of how we know that they are. The form of the 'central theory' remains unknown, and the actual calculations that have been done to date have mainly to do with various weak-field versions of what is merely a hypothesis. Some features even of these are far from clear: for example, how the apparently extremely stable properties of the known families of identical particles can be reliably deduced from the proposed model as being vibrations of a string, and whether all the features of General Relativity theory are satisfactorily recovered. Secondly, the theory relies on massive extrapolation from selected aspects of our existing physics onto very different scales and into very different conditions and thus goes way beyond the point where we have any proof that what is suggested is remotely right. Not only are there at present no experimental data supporting this vastly complex structure, but there may never be any, because the scale and energies required by much of the theory are such that it may for ever be beyond experimental investigation. It is possible that some variant of Super string theory will one day explain in a satisfactorily unified way the behaviour of precisely that spectrum of particles which we can detect in the world around us, including being able to predict their masses. If so, that will be one of the greatest feats of theoretical physics ever achieved. But we are a long way from that situation at pre sent. Even the concept of Supersymmetry, which plays a central role in the theory and should be amenable to experimental test, may or may not be true; none of the predicted supersymmetrical partner particles to known particles have yet been detected. Superstring theory is the one truly comprehensive attempt to find such a fundamental physical theory that we currently have, and it is a magnificent one. This is not enough of course to guarantee that it's right. It may have latched onto the correct intimations about the nature of the as yet unknown aspects of fundamental physics, but then again it may not. Greene doesn't try to conceal this uncertainty, but he is himself an enthusiast for the theory, something it's important not to lose sight of when reading this book.</p> <p>There was only one place in The Elegant Universe where I felt uncomfortable about what Greene was saying. It comes when he gets on to discussing the possibility of an ultimate 'Theory of Everything', and touches briefly on the issue of reductionism. He does not examine this as carefully as he might have done. He writes, for example: 'Almost everyone agrees that finding the TOE would in no way mean that psychology, biology, geology, chemistry or even physics had been solved or in some sense subsumed.' But why would any sensible person suppose such a thing? Any serious suggestion that Superstring theory might have such 'greedy' reductionist implications is likely to bring the whole programme into disrepute. If its reductionist implications are to be considered, then this should be done in a much more nuanced fashion. The philosophical implications of a theory dealing as this one does with the nature of emergent order and meaning in complex, hierarchically structured systems, should either be passed over altogether or dwelt on for longer than they are here. Greene might also have drawn attention to the limitations inherent in all of our mathematical and physical models of reality, and the need not to confuse them with reality itself. </p> <p>\u0095 To read more online essays from the current edition of the London Review of Books visit the <a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">LRB</a>.

Additionally, it seems now that not even the four 'fundamental' forces are independent of each other, but that the electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces are in fact different aspects of a single, more fundamental force, which would have functioned as a single interaction in the very early days of the Universe but appears under present-day conditions to comprise separate forces. Attempts to include the strong nuclear force also in this unifying scheme are well advanced. Even our understanding of space and time has evolved, these formerly distinct concepts now being understood as separate aspects of a single four-dimensional space-time continuum. This has two quite different sets of implications. On a large scale, gravity (which controls the evolution of the Universe) is now seen as being caused by the curvature of four-dimensional space-time, and as able to convey energy over vast distances by means of gravitational waves. On very small scales, when combined with quantum theory, it implies an equivalence between mass and energy (i.e. E = mc2), as evidenced in such nuclear reactions as those that power the radiance of the sun, and predicts the existence of anti-particles, which produce enormous amounts of energy when they annihilate with their corresponding particles - when an electron and its anti-particle, the positron, collide, for example, the result is pure radiation, emitted in the form of two high-energy photons; the particles then no longer exist. This in turn has led to a major revision of the concept of a 'vacuum' - understood nowadays not as an emptiness with nothing happening in it, but as a seething sea of particle and anti-particle pairs continually coming into existence and annihilating. All of this follows from the unification of relativity theory and quantum theory, two of the great intellectual achievements of this century. Despite all these advances, however, there are still great gaps to be filled in. The quest now is for an even more fundamental theory that would unify gravitation and quantum theory - something that has so far eluded us. The hope is that such a theory would also include the other three fundamental forces in a single scheme, and show them to be simply different aspects of a single 'super-force', explaining into the bargain many properties of fundamental particles that at the moment appear somewhat arbitrary. The most promising attempts made to date have given us the family of what are known as Superstring theories, in which our ideas of both particles and of space-time are revised in an astonishing way. According to Superstring theorists, our perceived four-dimensional space-time has to be seen as only an approximation to a ten or eleven-dimensional space-time, with the other six or seven spatial dimensions rolled up so small that they are indistinguishable from a point. On top of which, particles are no longer to be seen as point-like objects, but rather as patterns of vibrations of extended two-dimensional objects like strings or ribbons; thus electrons and quarks, for example, would be made up of vibrating Superstrings. This whole structure is subject to so-called 'Supersymmetry', whereby kinds of particle with apparently quite different properties are found to be related to each other and indeed may be transformed into each other under certain circumstances. For this method of unification to work, we need to identify symmetries in the inter actions re presented by (often hidden) similarities in the laws of physics. A simple example: if a physical system's interactions are constant in time, then its dynamical properties are the same at later times as they were at earlier times, and its energy is conserved; if the system's interactions are constant in space, then its momentum is conserved. And just as it's possible to represent mathematic ally the symmetries involved in the rotations of a solid object (a cube, say) that move it in such a way as to leave it exactly where it was but with the different faces rotated into each other, so we can represent the relation between families of fundamental particles in terms of abstract rotations that transform them into each other. Realising this has enabled physicists to predict the existence of previously unknown types of particle, which are required if we're to complete the symmetry patterns. Experimental proof of their existence has been a major vindication of this form of analysis. Up until quite recently, there were five alternative Superstring theories on offer, each with somewhat different symmetries, but this has now become an area of much excitement, as new unifications are achieved between models previously seen as distinct, suggesting that there may be only one theory that encompasses and unifies all of the others. The excitement came about with the discovery by the American theoretical physicist, Edward Witten, of previously undetected further sets of symmetries (or 'dualities'), which link various parts of the theory, in particular its reasonably well- understood low-energy aspects to the rather ill-understood high-energy ones, where it's not even clear how to formulate the theory. This should help us to understand 'strong-coupling' behaviour, which occurs when the interactions in a physical system are in tense because the energies involved are high, and which has hitherto been inaccessible because we don't know how to solve the immensely complex relevant equations. We can now do this by using one of the new symmetries to compare strong-coupling behaviour with the corresponding properties in a 'weak-coupling' regime, where the interactions are weak and thus easy to analyse. As the hype would have it, the discovery of these theoretical structures may mean we can one day complete the physicists' ultimate dream - a Theory of Everything (TOE) that will explain the behaviour of all the fundamental particles and forces in a single framework. In The Elegant Universe, Brian Greene guides us through these fundamental ideas and recent developments in as full and comprehensible a way as is possible without going into the exceedingly difficult mathematics involved. He aims to explain many of the central ideas of Superstring theories by means of analogy and explanatory diagrams rather than equations, and I can only say that his book is an explanatory tour de force. He starts with the basic ideas of relativity and quantum theory, explaining why these need to be unified, and then moves onto Superstrings. Here he goes into detail about the notion of 'quantum spin' (a microscopic version of the spin that can be put on a tennis ball) that separates particles into two distinct families: matter particles, which spin at one speed, and force-carrying particles that either don't spin or spin twice as much, but four times as much when the force is gravitational. He next shows how the theory of Supersymmetry connects these two families of particles and in so doing predicts the existence of many new part icles which we've yet to detect. From there, Greene goes on to the strange idea that the Universe may have more dimensions than meet the eye, may have 'both extended and curled-up dimensions'. The hope that we will be able to unify existing physical theories by means of these extra dimensions follows from ideas originally introduced by Theodor Kaluza and Oskar Klein, who suggested that space-time was really five rather than four-dimensional, the postulated fifth dimension carrying the electric and magnetic fields. Superstring theory in fact requires the Universe to have no fewer than nine spatial dimensions. The question then arises of why the three of them we are familiar with should be large and the other six so small as to be unnoticeable. Another problem arises from the extraordinarily complex structure that these curled-up dimensions are required to have: they are connected together in a contorted topology that is extremely difficult to describe. Nevertheless, the theory holds that they 'are an integral and ubiquitous part of the spatial fabric: they exist everywhere'. Greene is now at the point where he can deliver the final, astonishing, unifying vision: \"From one principle - that everything at its most microscopic level consists of combinations of vibrating strands - string theory provides a single explanatory framework capable of encompassing all forces and all matter... The observed particle properties... are a reflection of the various ways in which a string can vibrate... Force particles are also associated with particular patterns of string vibration, and hence everything, all matter and all forces, is unified under the same rubric of microscopic string oscillations - the 'notes' that a string can play. This result necessitates the existence of an infinite number of other particles in addition to those we've detected so far, but almost all of them will have to be so massive that we cannot now, nor indeed will be able ever, to achieve experimentally the energies that would be required to observe them. Greene comes right up to date by describing the dualities that tie the various aspects of string theory into a unity (the so-called 'M theory'), and discusses the way this can be used to calculate properties of black holes, before speculating about how it might all relate to cosmology. In particular, the theory has been used to calculate the number of physic al states that are no longer accessible to an observer because they are hidden behind the 'horizon' of a black hole. This calculation serves to confirm in an interesting way the idea first discovered by Bekenstein and Hawking, that when they collapse, massive astrophysical objects create a black hole which has remarkable thermodynamic properties, similar to those of ordinary thermodynamics - thus linking quantum theory, gravitational theory and thermodynamics in a way never before achieved. It would be hard to imagine anyone producing a clearer account than this of the difficult ideas involved, and Greene even brings out something of the actual excitement of scientific discovery when he recalls his own role in exploring some of the remarkable changes of structure that can occur in the topology of the new nine-dimensional space sections. Having said this, a word or two of caution is in order. First, Superstring theory is still far from complete; it is in many ways as yet simply a set of suggestions of the way things might be, rather than a well- developed theory of how we know that they are. The form of the 'central theory' remains unknown, and the actual calculations that have been done to date have mainly to do with various weak-field versions of what is merely a hypothesis. Some features even of these are far from clear: for example, how the apparently extremely stable properties of the known families of identical particles can be reliably deduced from the proposed model as being vibrations of a string, and whether all the features of General Relativity theory are satisfactorily recovered. Secondly, the theory relies on massive extrapolation from selected aspects of our existing physics onto very different scales and into very different conditions and thus goes way beyond the point where we have any proof that what is suggested is remotely right. Not only are there at present no experimental data supporting this vastly complex structure, but there may never be any, because the scale and energies required by much of the theory are such that it may for ever be beyond experimental investigation. It is possible that some variant of Super string theory will one day explain in a satisfactorily unified way the behaviour of precisely that spectrum of particles which we can detect in the world around us, including being able to predict their masses. If so, that will be one of the greatest feats of theoretical physics ever achieved. But we are a long way from that situation at pre sent. Even the concept of Supersymmetry, which plays a central role in the theory and should be amenable to experimental test, may or may not be true; none of the predicted supersymmetrical partner particles to known particles have yet been detected. Superstring theory is the one truly comprehensive attempt to find such a fundamental physical theory that we currently have, and it is a magnificent one. This is not enough of course to guarantee that it's right. It may have latched onto the correct intimations about the nature of the as yet unknown aspects of fundamental physics, but then again it may not. Greene doesn't try to conceal this uncertainty, but he is himself an enthusiast for the theory, something it's important not to lose sight of when reading this book. There was only one place in The Elegant Universe where I felt uncomfortable about what Greene was saying. It comes when he gets on to discussing the possibility of an ultimate 'Theory of Everything', and touches briefly on the issue of reductionism. He does not examine this as carefully as he might have done. He writes, for example: 'Almost everyone agrees that finding the TOE would in no way mean that psychology, biology, geology, chemistry or even physics had been solved or in some sense subsumed.' But why would any sensible person suppose such a thing? Any serious suggestion that Superstring theory might have such 'greedy' reductionist implications is likely to bring the whole programme into disrepute. If its reductionist implications are to be considered, then this should be done in a much more nuanced fashion. The philosophical implications of a theory dealing as this one does with the nature of emergent order and meaning in complex, hierarchically structured systems, should either be passed over altogether or dwelt on for longer than they are here. Greene might also have drawn attention to the limitations inherent in all of our mathematical and physical models of reality, and the need not to confuse them with reality itself. \u0095 To read more online essays from the current edition of the London Review of Books visit the LRB.

The cost was around \u00a31,200 (less than \u00a310 per head). </p> <p>The well will save Ghana money in the long-term. At any one time, half of Ghana's hospital beds are occupied by patients suffering from water-related diseases. </p> <p>Without clean water, sickness is constant. In Africa, water-related illnesses kill around 27,000 people every day. Drinking unsafe water affects Ghanaians' education as well as their health. \"Before the well, our children were constantly sick with diarrhoea and cholera, which meant we had to spend savings on medicines and hospital visits, leaving no money for school fees,\" explains Lucy. </p> <p>Carrying water is also hugely time-consuming and children, particularly girls, help their mothers to collect it daily, so school is often not an option. Women carry up to 20kg of water for miles on their head (that's equivalent to an overseas luggage allowance) - an exhausting activity, especially when you're malnourished. And time is lost from undertaking important activities such as farming, looking after the children, or earning a living from some income-generating activity. </p> <p>Without water, food also becomes scarce. \"Our livestock used to die and we couldn't grow vegetables and fruit for food or for sale,\" says Lucy. For communities without a water source nearby, even when food is available, if there is not enough water to cook, preparing meals is a constant struggle. </p> <p>Lucy talks about the well as if it has magical properties - it has even prompted a building boom in the village. \"Now we have water, we can build and mend our houses,\" she explains. \"Before, we had to carry so much water from the dam it was very difficult and we couldn't build very quickly in the heat because we didn't have clean water to drink.\" </p> <p>The well has also brought economic independence, especially to women. Many now earn the vital cash they need to pay for food and school fees through selling groundnuts and making butter from shea nuts or brewing pitu (a local drink). </p> <p>Having an alternative source of income through vegetable growing will improve soil conditions. One of the few means of earning cash for many rural households is to sell firewood. But with deforestation occurring rapidly, wood is scarce. Many households are now using millet stalks as fuel which means that the soil's nutrients are not replenished. Soil erosion increases, the fertility of the soil declines and the amount of food produced the following year falls. Less food means poorer health, and the cycle continues. </p> <p> Even for the 49% of rural communities in Ghana that do have safe water, the fight is not over. Climate change means that the dry season (known as \"the hunger season\") has increased over the last 20 years from around six months a year to eight. The amount of ground water has fallen, harvests have declined, food is scarce and income is reduced. With fewer trees surviving, a vicious cycle of soil erosion and deforestation is in motion and the Sahara's borders are spreading. Water is life. But when the forces of nature are reducing the amount of water available, life is precarious.</p> <p><strong>The problems</strong><br> There is growing recognition that the world is beginning to feel the first pangs of a chronic and systematic water crisis. More than a billion people do not have access to a water supply and three billion do not have adequate sanitation. Each year 3-4m people die of easily preventable waterborne diseases, including more than 2m young children who die of diarrhoea. </p> <p>\u0095 New problems of environmental degradation are emerging. Aquifers are being mined at an unprecedented rate. Almost 10% of the world's agricultural food production depends on using mined groundwater but water tables are falling as much as a metre a year in many parts of Mexico, India, Yemen and China. </p> <p>\u0095 Water diversions for irrigation have had devastating effects in Central Asia, with the Aral Sea shrinking to a fraction of its original size. The Huang He (Yellow river) did not run into the sea for more than 220 days in 1997. </p> <p>\u0095 Deforestation, land degradation salinisation and water contamination by chemicals, fertilizers, and human waste are all serious issues in many parts of the world. Rapidly growing cities and industries together with the use of more chemicals in agriculture have undermined the quality of many rivers, lakes and aquifers. </p> <p>\u0095 In the next two decades it is estimated that water use by humans will increase by about 40%, and that 17% more water will be needed to grow the food for the growing populations. In addition, the water demands for industry and energy will grow rapidly. Increases in the demand for irrigation water are likely to be matched by increases of 20% and 70% in the demand for water for industry and municipal use. </p> <p>\u0095 Increasing withdrawals for human use could impose intolerable stresses on the environment, leading not only to loss of biodiversity, but to a vicious circle in which the stressed ecosystems can no longer provide the services for plants and for people. </p> <p>\u0095 But if additional water for irrigation is not forthcoming, then the increases in rain-fed agriculture to meet the demand in food for nearly 8bn people will be enormous and would also have very detrimental environmental impacts. It would require that far more land be cleared for agriculture and losses of forests and habitats, and biodiversity on a massive scale. </p> <p>\u0095 Fresh water is becoming ever more precious. Only 2.5% of the world's water is not salty, and of that two-thirds is locked up in the icecaps and glaciers. Of the rest, some 20% is in areas too remote for human access, and of the remaining 80%, about three-quarters comes via monsoons and floods, and cannot be captured for use by people. What is left is less than 0.08 of 1% of the total water on the planet. </p> <p><strong>The solutions</strong><br> The rate of expansion of irrigated land and the use of hand pumps will determine future water stress. The conventional wisdom in agriculture is that irrigated land will have to keep pace by expanding hugely in future. However, this will inevitably lead to more large dams, more severe water shortages and serious risk of deteriorating natural ecosystems. Traditional farming practices are often found to be more cost effective than large irrigation schemes when all the benefits of an ecosystem, like providing firewood and fishing are taken into account. </p> <p>\u0095 About 300 new large dams (higher than 15 metres) are being added each year to the more than 39,000 in existence. Big dams almost always involve large displacements of people and other social problems, with the benefits tending to go to the rich. The World Commission on Dams will, later this year, provide a new consensus on when dams are appropriate, and on how they should be planned, designed, built and operated. About 1% of dam capacity is lost each year through silting. </p> <p>\u0095 Recharging groundwater - or underground - aquifers will become increasingly important as water levels fall. It needs to be done on a large scale in some areas and there is much debate about how to do it. One way might be to encourage the use of flooded paddy fields above the most seriously depleted aquifers. If groundwater is over-abstracted it leads to water quality loss, land degradation and poor public health. </p> <p>\u0095 There is scope for increasing rainfall \"harvesting\" through new and traditional methods, and through groundwater storage. These environmentally-friendly approaches are best suited to decentralised, community-based projects as they are cheap and can be managed locally. However, when water is collected upstream it reduces the run-off that people downstream can use. </p> <p>\u0095 Water harvesting is not just for rural communities in arid areas. Increasingly, as at the Dome or at Frankfurt airport, rainfall can be captured from vast roofs to provide all the water needed for cleaning, gardening and flushing toilets. </p> <p>\u0095 Semi-natural and artificial wetlands will be used increasingly to improve polluted waters and treat domestic effluents. However, as populations increase, the pressure to use land for farming becomes more extreme. </p> <p>\u0095 Protecting wetlands, floodplains and forests in upper catchment areas can protect people downstream from floods and damage to crops as well as providing natural storage areas for water. </p> <p>\u0095 Desalinating sea water now costs far less than in the past and this technology is expected to play a major role in providing water to coastal communities and industries in the future. But it is energy intensive and only rarely can it be cheap enough for food crops. </p> <p>\u0095 Many cities and towns experiencing water shortages are expected to turn to low or no-water sanitation systems. Municipal water supplies could be supplemented by extensive use of reclaimed urban wastewater for non-drinking uses. </p> <p>\u0095 One key is to grow crops that need less water. Biotechnology has a future in developing drought-resistant strains but there are other problems associated with this technology. </p> <p>\u0095 Better irrigation methods are important. Water can be applied uniformly to crops using precision irrigation. </p> <p>\u0095 Restrictions need to be placed on fertilisers, pesticides and chemicals which pollute water. </p> <p>\u0095 Financial resources: total investment in water services today is about $70-80bn a year. Government is by far the largest investor with the private sector contributing around $15bn, International aid contributes about $9bn. Investments will need to be massively increased over the next 25 years. </p> <p><strong> John Vidal</strong></p> <p>\u0095 Sources: <br> <a href=\"http://www.watervision.org\" target=\"_NEW\">World Water Vision</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.worldwatercouncil.org\" target=\"_NEW\">World Water Council</a></p> <p>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.wateraid.org.uk\">WaterAid</a> can be contacted on 0207 793 4500.</p>",

      "bodyText": "For Lucy Adingo, water is life. She is an impressive woman, a community leader, headmistress and one of the 38% of Ghana's women who has received an education. It was a simple statement but also a fundamental truth. Humans can survive several weeks without food, but die in four or five days without water. For the 1.4bn people in the world who don't have access to safe water (one quarter of the world's population) that means their water is a dirty, fetid soup. I stood with Lucy in front of the dam that once was used for everything - drinking, bathing, cooking, building, watering livestock. Fortunately, the village of Kandiga where Lucy lives - a poor, rural community of around 150 people in the arid upper East region - no longer has to rely on this water source for human consumption.

The home secretary remained unmoved. </p> <p>A change in thinking has now enabled a more progressive approach to the issue, and, significantly, paved the way for the first government-backed study of its kind in the UK. Commissioned last April by the Home Office, Derby university is undertaking extensive research into what the project leader, Paul Weller - a professor of inter-religious relations - admits is a complex and delicate area: \"However, there is more of an environment now to look at the problem as it is recognised at more levels in society. And consultative measures, as noted by various religious groups, weren't sufficiently rigorous as they drew no real consistency of response.\" </p> <p>An interim report, based on meetings with national religious bodies and secular groups, and a questionnaire of local, regional and national religious organisations, has recently been published. There are four aims: to assess evidence of religious discrimination, both actual and perceived; to describe the patterns shown by this evidence including its overall scale, the main victims and perpetrators and the main ways in which the discrimination manifests itself; to indicate the extent to which religious discrimination overlaps with racial discrimination/ethnicity; to identify the range of policy options available for dealing with such discrimination. </p> <p>Local fieldwork, involving semi-structured interviews with religious and secular groups, is concentrated on four areas where religious diversity exists. Completed in Leicester, where there are dominant Jain, Jewish and Hindu communities, researchers are currently collecting data in Newham, which has a large Muslim population alongside smaller Hindu and African- Christian groupings. This work will conclude in June in Cardiff and Blackburn, which have respectively large Sikh and Muslim populations. </p> <p>\"We are also looking at new movements, more popularly known as sects or cults, and those labelled new age, plus pagan traditions,\" explains Weller. \"Non-established religious groups must have a say. And individual biographies are also important, as people can tell their own stories.\" Although the university isn't due to submit its final report to the Home Office until September, some legislative change is already afoot. The incorporation into domestic law of the European Convention on Human Rights with regard to religious discrimination, through the Human Rights Act, comes into force in October. </p> <p>\"This is an important development, because people in British courts will now be able to appeal directly to convention rights on matters of belief and conscience in support of any issue,\" says Weller. \"It is limited, however, in that presently it only offers redress in respect of public authorities.\" </p> <p>In terms of the Fair Employment Act in Northern Ireland, which outlaws religious discrimination in the field of work, an important question arises: \"Since the Race Relations Act now operates there, why shouldn't the Employment Act apply here?\" </p> <p>The interim report also maps out a spectrum of analytical models - based on those used for racial discrimination - aimed at recognising what religious discrimination might be and how it might be understood. </p> <p>\"We need to differentiate, for example, between discrimination as attitudinal, which may or may not be evident in actions or structures, and religious hatred that results in violence,\" explains Weller. \"Direct and indirect discrimination in terms of job opportunities and unexamined policies and practices must also be addressed.

      "bodyText": "Published in 1992 and based on only preliminary research, the findings of the Commission for Racial Equality's second review of the Race Relations Act nevertheless broke new ground in that for the first time the issue of discrimination on the grounds of religion, as experienced in mainland Britain - particularly by minority ethnic communities - was formally recognised. However, in response to its recommendation that legislation outlawing such discrimination should be considered, the then home secretary, Michael Howard, was unmoved, citing a lack of \"hard evidence of discrimination against individuals on religious rather than racial grounds...\" In the light of concerns made known to the commission, a consultative exercise involving religious communities around Britain concluded in 1996 that the framing of legislation was imperative. The home secretary remained unmoved. A change in thinking has now enabled a more progressive approach to the issue, and, significantly, paved the way for the first government-backed study of its kind in the UK.

      "body": "<p>How responsive is New Labour? In the NHS, much is made of the government's intention to improve information to patients and the public. But what happens in practice if you want to challenge current policy? </p> <p>At a conference on June 9 last year, I heard Frank Dobson, the then secretary of state for health, describe our wonderful NHS as free at the point of use for those in need. Unable to catch the chair's eye to challenge Dobson on the spot, I subsequently wrote to him on June 22 pointing out that what he said was untrue for many of the oldest and frailest citizens. They do not receive free health care if they have the misfortune to land up in a nursing home and have assets over \u00a316,000. How could the Labour government justify this discrimination, which offends the founding principles of the NHS? </p> <p>There was no answer. A repeat letter on August 29 met the same fate. On September 9, I rang his personal assistant. She would ring back. She didn't. I rang again on September 20, and on September 29 a letter arrived saying: \"In view of the volume of correspondence that the minister receives day by day, it is not generally possible for him to deal personally with letters received from the general public.\" The rest of the letter reiterated the present situation but did not address my original point that the policy was unfair and against the statutory requirement (in the 1946 act) that the NHS provide free health care at the point of need. </p> <p>My next letter made this clear. Again there was no answer. I rang on November 9. From this conversation it appeared that ministers can receive at least 70,000 letters a year. These are forwarded, after a slight delay, to a correspondence unit. The person to whom I spoke had 100 letters on her desk requiring answers. She sounded fed up. Naturally, she and her colleagues can only give standard replies. Speaking to her supervisor, I established that, in her opinion, the only way to get at the minister is through your MP. Accordingly, I did this on November 23. </p> <p>His office helpfully sent me a copy of the parliamentary debate on long-term care and funding, which occurred in early December. </p> <p>But still the original point lay unanswered. I suggested that the local MP pursue the minister further. That was on January 11 - and nothing has been heard since. </p> <p>So what lessons can be learnt? First, it is obviously pointless writing to a minister. The next approach might be - in this case because it is about health policy - to use the community health council, but there is little evidence that the CHC will be able to access the minister's in-tray any more than the average citizen. </p> <p>Age Concern is conducting a campaign, the Debate of the Age, which includes this issue but also covers many other aspects of discrimination against elderly people. It is probably unhelpful to their greater agenda to push one point only. It is clear from the increase in the number of phone-in programmes that many citizens have a beef they want to get off their chest. </p> <p>If you get on to Radio 4's Any Answers or You and Yours you will have your two minutes of airtime, but will this make any difference? Similarly, letters to the paper may make you feel better, but, as there is little comeback, it is also frustrating. </p> <p>There is an injustice here and, in a democracy, it should be possible for any citizen to register his or her concern. But it is clear that this requires skill. The matter must first be seen as important by more people than yourself and then ways have to be found to maintain the issue in the public consciousness. This is the reason for not giving up but using every opportunity to reiterate the issue. </p> <p>Finally, there must be some possibility that something can be done, as banging on regardless quickly loses allies. This particular matter requires government commitment. </p> <p>At last, there is some evidence that the pressure is getting to the government and they cannot indefinitely disregard the recommendations of the commission on long-term care. </p> <p>But do not waste your time writing to politicians. Maintaining the accountability of our government to us citizens requires much more than a first class stamp.</p> <p>\u0095 Andrew Wall is a former health service manager.</p>",

      "bodyText": "How responsive is New Labour? In the NHS, much is made of the government's intention to improve information to patients and the public. But what happens in practice if you want to challenge current policy? At a conference on June 9 last year, I heard Frank Dobson, the then secretary of state for health, describe our wonderful NHS as free at the point of use for those in need. Unable to catch the chair's eye to challenge Dobson on the spot, I subsequently wrote to him on June 22 pointing out that what he said was untrue for many of the oldest and frailest citizens. They do not receive free health care if they have the misfortune to land up in a nursing home and have assets over \u00a316,000. How could the Labour government justify this discrimination, which offends the founding principles of the NHS? There was no answer. A repeat letter on August 29 met the same fate. On September 9, I rang his personal assistant. She would ring back. She didn't. I rang again on September 20, and on September 29 a letter arrived saying: \"In view of the volume of correspondence that the minister receives day by day, it is not generally possible for him to deal personally with letters received from the general public.\" The rest of the letter reiterated the present situation but did not address my original point that the policy was unfair and against the statutory requirement (in the 1946 act) that the NHS provide free health care at the point of need. My next letter made this clear. Again there was no answer. I rang on November 9. From this conversation it appeared that ministers can receive at least 70,000 letters a year. These are forwarded, after a slight delay, to a correspondence unit. The person to whom I spoke had 100 letters on her desk requiring answers. She sounded fed up. Naturally, she and her colleagues can only give standard replies. Speaking to her supervisor, I established that, in her opinion, the only way to get at the minister is through your MP. Accordingly, I did this on November 23. His office helpfully sent me a copy of the parliamentary debate on long-term care and funding, which occurred in early December. But still the original point lay unanswered. I suggested that the local MP pursue the minister further. That was on January 11 - and nothing has been heard since. So what lessons can be learnt? First, it is obviously pointless writing to a minister. The next approach might be - in this case because it is about health policy - to use the community health council, but there is little evidence that the CHC will be able to access the minister's in-tray any more than the average citizen. Age Concern is conducting a campaign, the Debate of the Age, which includes this issue but also covers many other aspects of discrimination against elderly people. It is probably unhelpful to their greater agenda to push one point only. It is clear from the increase in the number of phone-in programmes that many citizens have a beef they want to get off their chest. If you get on to Radio 4's Any Answers or You and Yours you will have your two minutes of airtime, but will this make any difference? Similarly, letters to the paper may make you feel better, but, as there is little comeback, it is also frustrating. There is an injustice here and, in a democracy, it should be possible for any citizen to register his or her concern. But it is clear that this requires skill. The matter must first be seen as important by more people than yourself and then ways have to be found to maintain the issue in the public consciousness. This is the reason for not giving up but using every opportunity to reiterate the issue. Finally, there must be some possibility that something can be done, as banging on regardless quickly loses allies. This particular matter requires government commitment. At last, there is some evidence that the pressure is getting to the government and they cannot indefinitely disregard the recommendations of the commission on long-term care. But do not waste your time writing to politicians. Maintaining the accountability of our government to us citizens requires much more than a first class stamp. \u0095 Andrew Wall is a former health service manager.",

      "bodyText": "An independent inquiry today attacked the government for politicising the NHS by appointing Labour supporters to hospital boards. The report's release was an embarrassing counterpoint to Mr Blair's scheduled pep talk to NHS officials and to chancellor Gordon Brown's Budget increase in funding for Britain's beleaguered health service. In yesterday's Budget, Mr Brown announced a \u00a32bn increase for the NHS as part of a massive four-year boost to health spending, the biggest sustained increase in the service's 52-year history. But the report from the commissioner for public appointments, Dame Rennie Fritchie, takes the edge off Labour's generally well-received Budget by accusing the government of cronyism and calling for a fundamental review of the way people are appointed to run hospitals and local NHS trusts. The report found that out of the total number of local councillors appointed to health authorities and NHS trusts between May 1, 1997, and November 11, 1999, 284 were from the Labour party, 36 were Liberal Democrats and 23 were Conservatives. Dame Rennie said: \"There are examples where a candidate's political association has been a decisive factor in their early selection and appointment and that decisions have not always been based on merit.\" Her report concluded that the process of selection had been politicised. The problem stemmed from the system of inviting MPs and local authorities to nominate candidates, she said. Although the practice of inviting MPs to comment on a shortlist of candidates was introduced by the Conservative government when NHS trusts were first established, Dame Rennie said it had gained a new momentum since Labour came to power. In an assessment which will surely resurface in the London mayoral race, Dame Rennie blamed Frank Dobson for the increased politicisation of the NHS. \"Much of this stems from the wish of the then secretary of state for health, Mr Dobson, to increase the presence on NHS boards of representatives from the community and the accompanying decision to seek nominations from MPs and local authorities,\" she said. Dame Rennie called for the practice of systematically consulting MPs about shortlisted candidates should be ended - as should the practice of seeking nominations directly from local authorities.

A basic large-scale map supplied by Nato for the first time indicates that the shells were used in 20 locations along the Albanian border, and eight more inside the province. The UN's Balkan task force, which is evaluating the environmental impact of the conflict in Kosovo and Serbia, only received information about the use of the armour-piercing depleted uranium (DU) shells on February 7, four months after a personal intervention by the UN secretary general, Kofi Annan.

The danger comes mainly from inhalation or swallowing particles of DU.

But his new method - which involves withholding payment from the film-makers until the movie accrues its target box-office take - is likely to further deteriorate relations between Hollywood studios and beleaguered industry unions.</p> <p>Disney's new deal may popularise deferments as a way of studios producing more films above $100m while avoiding co-financing pacts, which reduce profits. So far, Pearl Harbor's director of photography, editor, production designer and lighting director have agreed to defer payment - amounting to a saving of between $5m and $10m - while effects house ILM has agreed to \"meaningful deferments\" said to cost close to $25m.</p> <p>The studio pledges that if the film reaches a domestic gross of about $140m (a target only a handful of films reached in the last year), crew members will recoup what they would have been paid under normal circumstances.</p> <p>Critics of the move insist that industry workers may now find themselves having to choose whether to work for cheap or not work at all. Even with deferred pay, they lose money: a salary paid in two years will lose employees the interest they could have accrued in the interim. A spokesman from the Directors Guild of America claimed to be \"appalled by this trend\". Loadsamoney director <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Name?Bay,+Michael\">Michael Bay</a> happily admits: \"I am going into this thinking that I am not going to make a dime.

      "bodyText": "A row has erupted over Disney's scheme to defer payment to the crew of imminent blockbuster Pearl Harbor. \"I want to change the way $100m movies get made,\" says Bruce Hendricks, the studio's president of motion picture production. But his new method - which involves withholding payment from the film-makers until the movie accrues its target box-office take - is likely to further deteriorate relations between Hollywood studios and beleaguered industry unions. Disney's new deal may popularise deferments as a way of studios producing more films above $100m while avoiding co-financing pacts, which reduce profits. So far, Pearl Harbor's director of photography, editor, production designer and lighting director have agreed to defer payment - amounting to a saving of between $5m and $10m - while effects house ILM has agreed to \"meaningful deferments\" said to cost close to $25m. The studio pledges that if the film reaches a domestic gross of about $140m (a target only a handful of films reached in the last year), crew members will recoup what they would have been paid under normal circumstances. Critics of the move insist that industry workers may now find themselves having to choose whether to work for cheap or not work at all. Even with deferred pay, they lose money: a salary paid in two years will lose employees the interest they could have accrued in the interim. A spokesman from the Directors Guild of America claimed to be \"appalled by this trend\". Loadsamoney director Michael Bay happily admits: \"I am going into this thinking that I am not going to make a dime. But I would rather gamble on myself.\" According to Disney's Hendricks, \"certainly the production won't be as comfortable as people are used to. But no one was arm-twisted into doing this movie. Everyone knew that to do this movie, that's what needed to happen\". The controversial move, he continues, was \"just something I came up with after seeing it done with such studio movies as The English Patient,\" clearly unaware that that Oscar-winning film's crew have yet to be paid three years after its successful release.",

Winning matters to Ganguly and defeat weighs heavily. He fights to the last, bursting with defiance.

The Pope has dreamed of this journey from the beginnings of his papacy in 1978. But there was no mistaking him for a humble pilgrim. He landed to the blare of trumpets from a military honour guard, and was greeted by Israeli dignitaries including the president, prime minister and mayor of Jerusalem, along with Christian, Muslim and Druze religious leaders. The pomp of the reception underlined the political significance of this first state visit to Israel by a bishop of Rome, and also the Pope's efforts to heal centuries of distrust between Catholics and Jews. But the brief welcoming ceremony also contained an augury of the tortuous journey that lies ahead as the Pope follows in Jesus's footsteps. For the next six days every word he utters will be scrutinised for meaning - not just by ordinary Jews, but by Palestinian and Israeli officials who seek endorsement for their political aspirations. Moments after the band played the Israeli and Vatican anthems, it launched into Jerusalem the Golden, a hymn asserting the historic claim of the Jews to the holy city. Even the Pope's accommodation has become contentious, with Palestinian activists stealthily raising their national flag near the apostolic residence on the Mount of Olives in east Jerusalem, and Israeli officials just as hurriedly ripping it down. The last papal visit - in 1964 - was a furtive affair, during which Pope Paul VI never once uttered the word Israel. This Pope acknowledged that era was over. He said that \"Jews and Catholics together must make courageous efforts to remove all forms of prejudice\". Such efforts for healing must go further still, embracing the third faith of the Holy Land - Islam - he said. They were sweet words for the country's president, Ezer Weizman, who gave the official welcome. Yet he could not resist extracting more political advantage from the Pope's presence, by driving home Israel's claim to Jerusalem - a claim unrecognised by the international community. \"You are arriving this evening in Jerusalem, the city of peace, the capital of the state of Israel, the heart of the Jewish world,\" he said. \"Jerusalem has been the heart of the Jewish people throughout all the generations, it is what gives us our spiritiual inspiration. Jerusalem is the city of eternity.\" Palestinians will get their chance to reply to Israel's political manoevrings today when the Pope visits Bethlehem, which is under the control of the Palestinian National Authority. What the local papers say Yediot Ahronot Tel Aviv There has not been a pontiff like him, who has contributed to the deepening of ties and enhancement of understanding between Christianity and Judaism, and between Israel and the Vatican. There has not been a pontiff like him who has worked to erase the church's anti-Semitism Maariv Tel Aviv When the vicar of Christ paces the Via Dolorosa, this will destroy the efforts of Israeli politicians to turn Jerusalem into a Jewish ghetto. Billions of Christians and Muslims will see and remember that the city is also holy to them Jerusalem Post The political revolution in Vatican-Israel relations exemplifed by the Pope's visit should continue with the political equivalent of a change in theology. Although the Vatican no longer speaks of internationalising Jerusalem, neither has it fully recognised Jerusalem as Israel's eternal capital Al-Quds international Palestinian paper The Pope's visit to Israel carries a message of tolerance and coexistence and forgiveness for three religions in the troublesome region. It is courageous for the Pope to apologise to the Muslims and Arabs because of the crusaders' atrocities",

They were hanging from bed sheets tied to the cell's window bars.</p> <p>Nasri, from Tottenham, north London, was on remand awaiting trial at Nottingham crown court for the murder of his girlfriend, Jennifer Elverson and her son Benjamin, seven, in a fire at their home in Normanton, Derby, on November 14.</p> <p>Jacques had been jailed for four months for theft by Derby magistrates on March 9 after failing to pay for petrol at a filling station.</p> <p>The men had been sharing a cell in the prison's A-wing since March 16. Sources said the men were taken off suicide watch about nine days ago.</p> <p>The prison service confirmed to the Guardian last night that the men had both been on, and then taken off, suicide watch, but could not say when that had occurred. An internal prison investigation and a police inquiry have been launched.</p> <p>A police source said it was unclear whether the deaths were a double suicide, or whether one man had killed the other then killed himself.</p> <p>No notes were found. The police are not looking for other suspects.</p> <p>Harry Fletcher, the assistant general secretary of the National Association of Probation Officers, said: \"It's terrible. There needs to be an investigation into the whole suicide watch procedure.\"</p> <p>In a separate incident at Parkhurst prison, on the Isle of Wight, another prisoner, Michael McCarthy, 22, was found hanged at 6.10am. He was found by a prisoner in an area reserved for vulnerable inmates. McCarthy had just begun serving five years and five months for burglary.

      "bodyText": "Two prisoners found hanged in the same cell yesterday had been taken off suicide watch just nine days ago, it was revealed last night. Farouk Mohammed Nasri, 54, and Carl Jacques, 23, were discovered dead at 6.20am in their double cell in Leicester prison. They were hanging from bed sheets tied to the cell's window bars. Nasri, from Tottenham, north London, was on remand awaiting trial at Nottingham crown court for the murder of his girlfriend, Jennifer Elverson and her son Benjamin, seven, in a fire at their home in Normanton, Derby, on November 14. Jacques had been jailed for four months for theft by Derby magistrates on March 9 after failing to pay for petrol at a filling station. The men had been sharing a cell in the prison's A-wing since March 16. Sources said the men were taken off suicide watch about nine days ago. The prison service confirmed to the Guardian last night that the men had both been on, and then taken off, suicide watch, but could not say when that had occurred. An internal prison investigation and a police inquiry have been launched. A police source said it was unclear whether the deaths were a double suicide, or whether one man had killed the other then killed himself. No notes were found. The police are not looking for other suspects. Harry Fletcher, the assistant general secretary of the National Association of Probation Officers, said: \"It's terrible. There needs to be an investigation into the whole suicide watch procedure.\" In a separate incident at Parkhurst prison, on the Isle of Wight, another prisoner, Michael McCarthy, 22, was found hanged at 6.10am. He was found by a prisoner in an area reserved for vulnerable inmates. McCarthy had just begun serving five years and five months for burglary. His is the first death at Parkhurst since 1996. These deaths bring the number of suicides in British jails this year to 19, a rate comparable with the highest-ever recorded figure of 91 during the whole in 1999 - more than twice the 1993 figure. Double suicides in British prison are very rare, although two men died in the same cell at Brixton, south London, in December last year. In 1990, two 19-year-old men were found hanged in adjoining cells in Hindley remand centre, near Wigan. In 1993, Leicester's Victorian jail was described by Inquest, the charity which campaigns for the families of people who die in custody, as the \"suicide capital of the prison system\". Three prisoners, all on remand, committed suicide there last year after two years with no deaths. Sir David Ramsbotham, the chief inspector of prisons, said in a review last year that a \"fresh approach\" to suicide was needed in the \"massively overcrowded\" local prisons such as Leicester, where the vast majority of suicides take place. He said a \"complete culture change\" was needed, following the success of initiative at bigger jails like Parkhurst. The director of the Prison Service, Martin Narey, said that he wanted to introduce cells without window bars, with no points from which prisoners could be hanged. In his 1998 report on Leicester prison, which currently holds 356 prisoners, Sir David said staff displayed \"pride and sense of purpose\". But he complained of cuts in the prison budget, and of inadequate facilities for education and exercise. Deborah Coles, the co-director of Inquest, said last night: \"It doesn't seem that the lessons are being learned. Local prisons have the most limited regimes in terms of out-of-cell activities. \"David Ramsbotham's review came up with some very sensible recommendations [but] they are impossible to implement in this kind of prison where the emphasis is on containment and control rather than humanity and care.\"",

The judgment, which is likely to be appealed, is a major defeat for Florida-based Cuban exiles who are fighting to keep the boy in the US. Elian was found clinging to an inflated inner tube off the coast of Florida on November 25 last year, after his mother and 10 other people drowned when their boat capsized during an attempt to escape from Cuba to the US. In January, the US immigration and naturalisation service (INS) ordered that usual international procedure should be followed in Elian's case, and that he should be returned to the custody of his nearest relative - Juan Gonzalez, his father. This was approved by Ms Reno, who has legal responsibility for the the decisions of the INS. But Elian's great-uncle in Miami, Lazaro Gonzalez, contested the decision, saying the boy had more of a future in the US. The case has turned into a political battle between anti-Castro Cubans and their allies, and the Cuban government and its supporters, for whom Elian has become a nationalist symbol. In a 50-page ruling yesterday, Judge Michael Moore comprehensively dismissed the challenge by Elian's Florida relatives, who had asked the Miami court to overrule Ms Reno and order an asylum hearing. He ruled that granting asylum was \"a matter within the discretion of the attorney general\". \"Even this well intended litigation has the capacity to bring about unintended harm,\" his judgment went on. \"In light of the attorney general's clearly articulated views on the matter of whether Elian Gonzalez should return home, as well as the reality that each passing day is another day lost between Juan Gonzalez and his son, the court can only hope that those on each side of this litigation place the interests of Elian Gonzalez above all others.\" Though the initial reaction from legal experts was that Judge Moore had correctly interpreted the law, the Miami relatives and their supporters have 30 days in which to lodge an appeal. If one is lodged, the US court of appeals has wide discretion over whether to expedite it. Whatever the outcome, a further referral to the US supreme court is probable, meaning that Elian is unlikely to return to Cuba for several more months. The case has become so politically charged that an intervention by the US congress is also likely, in spite of the judge's warning. Many Republican politicians want congress to grant US citizenship to Elian, a move that would make an early return to Cuba even less likely. The longer the case runs, the less legal and administrative procedures may be able to determine Elian's fate: in an election year the boy is likely to be increasingly at the mercy of political forces in Florida - a key swing state in this year's presidential battle between the Republican George W Bush, and the Democrat Al Gore.",

Last week's decision to bow to pressure from the Wellcome Trust by agreeing to relocate the \u00a3500m government-funded Diamond synchrotron project in Oxfordshire - rather than underpin its present successful base in Cheshire - is seen by many backbenchers, leading scientists, and the North West RDA, as a blow to regional policy by encouraging southern clusters at the expense of the north.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Gordon Brown moved to defuse backbench criticism of a growing north-south economic divide with a new \u00a31bn venture capital fund to kick-start innovation and job creation in the regions as well as Scotland and Wales. With the government under attack over near-standstill budgets for eight new English regional development agencies (RDAs), the chancellor pledged to work with the business-led RDAs to achieve \"balanced economic development\" across Britain with a modern regional policy. The extra cash will come from a partnership between the government, business and the European Investment Bank, he said. Derek Mapp, chairman of the East Midlands RDA and spokesman for the eight agencies, said they expected that the new fund would initially be spread over three years with the government providing \u00a3250m - possibly by amalgamating existing schemes - with business contributing another \u00a3250m and the EIB \u00a3500m. \"Instead of a disparate approach where different government departments are doing different things they are saying let's get all this linked together with quite a lot of new money,\" he said. \"This is probably the first attempt at some regional dispersal and it will allow us to leverage in a significant amount of extra funding with the government providing the necessary security.\" Mr Brown announced provisional regional targets in England, amounting to \u00a3835m - with the remaining \u00a3165m presumably going to Scotland and Wales. He said \u00a385m would go to the south-west; \u00a3120m to the north-west; \u00a3130m to the north-east and Yorkshire; \u00a3250m to the midlands and the east and \u00a3250m to London and the south-east. The chancellor also said that the trade and industry secretary, Stephen Byers, would next week be announcing a regional innovation fund to help the formation of local \"clusters\" for hi-tech industries - along the lines of successful growth centres around Cambridge and the M4 corridor. But the government is certain to face criticism that its rhetoric does not match the economic reality on the ground. Last week's decision to bow to pressure from the Wellcome Trust by agreeing to relocate the \u00a3500m government-funded Diamond synchrotron project in Oxfordshire - rather than underpin its present successful base in Cheshire - is seen by many backbenchers, leading scientists, and the North West RDA, as a blow to regional policy by encouraging southern clusters at the expense of the north.",

      "body": "<p>Like a maestro debuting his fourth and finest symphony, Gordon Brown's hour at the dispatch box yesterday should have been his most golden. The climate shines on him more generously than any chancellor you can name. Just days ago Britain learnt that its economy had nudged ahead of France to become the fourth mightiest in the world. Under Brown, the country's accounts have moved from blood red to reassuring black. Yesterday he could brag and boast his way through an astonishing battery of numbers: growth higher than predicted, inflation lower than planned, unemployment at its lowest for 20 years and a deficit in 1997 converted into a \u00a312bn surplus today. Even the usually-ascetic chancellor couldn't resist offering a toast to himself. This fine record was the result of a strong economy and \"our prudent management\".</p> <p>But self-congratulation was not enough for the restless Mr Brown. He quickened the pace, the maestro wowing his audience with sheer audacity. He revealed delights that would have made even his Tory predecessors blush.

      "bodyText": "Like a maestro debuting his fourth and finest symphony, Gordon Brown's hour at the dispatch box yesterday should have been his most golden. The climate shines on him more generously than any chancellor you can name. Just days ago Britain learnt that its economy had nudged ahead of France to become the fourth mightiest in the world. Under Brown, the country's accounts have moved from blood red to reassuring black. Yesterday he could brag and boast his way through an astonishing battery of numbers: growth higher than predicted, inflation lower than planned, unemployment at its lowest for 20 years and a deficit in 1997 converted into a \u00a312bn surplus today. Even the usually-ascetic chancellor couldn't resist offering a toast to himself. This fine record was the result of a strong economy and \"our prudent management\". But self-congratulation was not enough for the restless Mr Brown. He quickened the pace, the maestro wowing his audience with sheer audacity. He revealed delights that would have made even his Tory predecessors blush. He slashed through capital gains tax too fast for the scribblers on the opposition benches to keep up. Within seconds he was on to inheritance tax, hacking away at it at such speed that the thing was in ribbons before MPs could pause for breath. Once he was done, the House could only marvel at a Labour chancellor who had served up a budget that could have been written by the Elders of Middle England.

We want him to talk to us, his people, but he insists on talking to the enemy too. All those familiar Brownisms - prudent, prudent, prudent - somehow fail to charm.

So we get a triumphant reminder that inheritance tax is almost defunct: as the rich avoid it, 96% of the people never pay any. (Hurray for the inheritance principle?)

If he can do all these wonderful things for the people and the services that really need it, does it matter how much tax is taken? It does if taxing more allows even more spending, without raising interest rates. But why tax for taxing's sake? Ideology does not feed poor children, buys no new teachers or nurses, builds no health centres or colleges. The history of ideology in British politics is dismal - think Michael Foot and Margaret Thatcher. And yet this is not the end of history. Politics do still matter. People need to be given a coherent account of what the government is doing and why, who they are for, who against. Parties need to define themselves with rallying cries to their natural supporters. People see very little of what is actually happening but they believe the stories they are told. Why else would an astounding 40% of people tell the Guardian/ICM poll this week that they feel worse off this year than last, when for most of them it simply cannot be true?

Where's the red thread that links a hundred good practical schemes? Where is the signpost, so people don't get lost? There was too little glue in Gordon Brown's speech. Playing both ends against the middle, he risks failing to get the great credit he deserves from his own side. Prudent he may have said, over and over again, yet there was an air of throwing money in every direction in something of a panic - the same panic that made the prime minister promise such monster sums to the NHS on the David Frost show (why on earth there and then?). There's a bung to keep education quiet for a bit and a plethora of fiddly measures designed to keep everyone happy. A few of them are mildly daft - like the government giving more money for every penny donated to charity (remember, that means taxpayers' money going to dogs, Eton and every religion, even Odin worshippers).

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Gordon Brown's fourth Budget contains a broadside of measures to appease Labour heartlands, mollify Middle England and stimulate small businesses ahead of a general election next year. The chancellor has again pulled off the political conjuring trick we are now getting used to. He is planning an almost unprecedented 6.1% annual increase in health spending - above the rate of inflation - for the next four years (plus an extra \u00a31bn for schools) while simultaneously tightening the fiscal stance (the balance between borrowing, spending and taxation) quite substantially by over 1% of of gross domestic product. He is sitting on Fort Knox in the form of a \u00a312bn budget surplus - one of the biggest in history - but in practice he has had to put Scrooge's cap on because his largesse has been constrained by the need not to upset the City by spending too much at a time when the economy is in danger of overheating.</p> <p>On the first of the two tests on which we said this budget should be assessed - the need to boost spending substantially on health and education - he has come out with flying colours. But on the second -measures to bring down the over-strong pound - the jury is still out. The Treasury argues that it has already hugely tightened fiscal policy in recent years in the hope that this would take the pressure off the pound, but that has not worked. The problem, it believes, is the weak euro, not the strong pound, and when the EU economy awakens from its slumbers, as it is now showing signs of doing, the problem will sort itself out. Maybe. But until it does, the Treasury's prediction of a near 6% rise in export volume this year (compared with 2.5% last year) looks like wishful thinking.</p> <p>But even within his fiscal constraints Mr Brown has money to scatter around, thanks to lower debt interest payments, higher tax receipts and reduced outlays on social security. Small and medium-sized businesses will welcome his \u00a3225m reduction in capital gains tax liabilities on business assets and a sheaf of other measures, including \u00a3280m for a new all-employee share plan. He also promises to look at the problems of dot.com companies, worried about tax liabilities arising from share options on which their early success depends. Middle England will be relieved that the problems of the health service are to be tackled (after the neglect of Labour's first two years) even if they are not yet convinced that Mr Blair's target of matching European generosity is on the horizon.</p> <p>This was a Budget in which Labour threw itself as never before behind nurturing entrepreneurs, while also giving help to the poor - especially pensioners. Their increases, while hardly dramatic, are more generous than they look because they have been craftily targeted to help the really needy. Only a year ago, education was due to get more than health in this latest budget - an extra \u00a33.5bn compared to health's \u00a32.9bn. But since then the health service has been hit by flu and a winter crisis. Public support for Labour's handling of health steadily bled away in its first two years, but this last winter created a critical haemorrhage. Hence the prime minister's decision to intervene. He will speak more fully in the Commons today of Labour's new programme for the NHS, but the key injection - cash - was dealt with by the chancellor yesterday. Instead of an extra \u00a32.9bn, the health service will receive \u00a34.9bn for the financial year that starts in 10 days time - a 7.4% increase. This will be the first of four increases through to April 2004, averaging 6.1%. The health service has seen nothing like it. Its increases have averaged only 3.3% since its foundation and the last Conservative government averaged only 2.9%. True, the Tories pushed up spending by 9% in 1991 to save their \"internal market\", but no government has achieved such a sustained level of investment. It is a health managers' dream, an opportunity to look and plan for the medium term rather than merely tomorrow. A health budget which was \u00a345.1bn only last year, will rise to \u00a368.7bn by April 2004 - a 50% increase in cash terms and a 35% increase in real terms. Sceptics will say that not even this huge investment will lift British health spending to the European average, as Mr Blair promised in January on the David Frost programme. They would be right, in that it is due to lift spending (both public and private) to 7.6% of GDP. But that is only 0.4% short of the crude European average.</p> <p>Although education has only received \u00a31bn extra compared to health's \u00a32bn on this April's planned increases, education still achieved a higher proportionate rise: some 8%. There is no doubt that health is in a much sorrier state than education, so honour would be achieved by health receiving the bigger cash injection with education maintaining a higher proportionate rise. Headteachers were delighted not just with the extra funds but the method of distribution direct to the school. What was particularly welcome was the freedom for the schools to chose how the extra was spent: on books, technology or staff.</p> <p>There was much less excitement on the anti-poverty front, where the two previous budgets introduced the best deal for the poor for a generation. But earlier announcements were consolidated, with the New Deal's welfare-to-work programmes extended to long-term unemployed, older workers and lone parents. By the end of the next financial year 1m children will have been lifted out of poverty and there are already plans to lift another million over three years through an integrated child credit. If that is achieved, the government will be on target to cut child poverty in half by 2010 - a new halfway house before the ultimate goal of complete abolition by 2020. One welcome new trend was the chancellor's readiness to point to the redistribution that Labour is achieving. Civic society is being renewed.</p> <p>Mr Brown, in sum, may have \"given away\" about as much as he could without frightening the City. Many people will still be understandably bemused as to why a chancellor sporting a record budget surplus, with more expected in coming years, cannot do even more to rectify the glaring deficiencies in health, education and transport.

      "bodyText": "Gordon Brown's fourth Budget contains a broadside of measures to appease Labour heartlands, mollify Middle England and stimulate small businesses ahead of a general election next year. The chancellor has again pulled off the political conjuring trick we are now getting used to. He is planning an almost unprecedented 6.1% annual increase in health spending - above the rate of inflation - for the next four years (plus an extra \u00a31bn for schools) while simultaneously tightening the fiscal stance (the balance between borrowing, spending and taxation) quite substantially by over 1% of of gross domestic product. He is sitting on Fort Knox in the form of a \u00a312bn budget surplus - one of the biggest in history - but in practice he has had to put Scrooge's cap on because his largesse has been constrained by the need not to upset the City by spending too much at a time when the economy is in danger of overheating. On the first of the two tests on which we said this budget should be assessed - the need to boost spending substantially on health and education - he has come out with flying colours. But on the second -measures to bring down the over-strong pound - the jury is still out. The Treasury argues that it has already hugely tightened fiscal policy in recent years in the hope that this would take the pressure off the pound, but that has not worked. The problem, it believes, is the weak euro, not the strong pound, and when the EU economy awakens from its slumbers, as it is now showing signs of doing, the problem will sort itself out. Maybe. But until it does, the Treasury's prediction of a near 6% rise in export volume this year (compared with 2.5% last year) looks like wishful thinking. But even within his fiscal constraints Mr Brown has money to scatter around, thanks to lower debt interest payments, higher tax receipts and reduced outlays on social security. Small and medium-sized businesses will welcome his \u00a3225m reduction in capital gains tax liabilities on business assets and a sheaf of other measures, including \u00a3280m for a new all-employee share plan. He also promises to look at the problems of dot.com companies, worried about tax liabilities arising from share options on which their early success depends. Middle England will be relieved that the problems of the health service are to be tackled (after the neglect of Labour's first two years) even if they are not yet convinced that Mr Blair's target of matching European generosity is on the horizon. This was a Budget in which Labour threw itself as never before behind nurturing entrepreneurs, while also giving help to the poor - especially pensioners. Their increases, while hardly dramatic, are more generous than they look because they have been craftily targeted to help the really needy. Only a year ago, education was due to get more than health in this latest budget - an extra \u00a33.5bn compared to health's \u00a32.9bn. But since then the health service has been hit by flu and a winter crisis. Public support for Labour's handling of health steadily bled away in its first two years, but this last winter created a critical haemorrhage. Hence the prime minister's decision to intervene.

      "body": "<p>Gordon Brown yesterday threw a \u00a32bn lifeline to the ailing NHS as part of a huge four-year boost to health spending designed to allay public concern over Labour's most vulnerable area in the run-up to the next election. </p> <p>After a winter of crisis in Britain's hospitals, Mr Brown opened his brimming war chest to bring forward part of his planned summer spending round. He pledged a 35% real increase in funds for the NHS by 2004, the biggest sustained increase in its 52-year history. </p> <p>The first fruits of the chancellor's surprise announcement - the centrepiece of his fourth Budget - will be a sustained drive to recruit 10,000 more nurses and better intensive care, but Mr Brown emphasised that the extra cash would have to be matched by reform and modernisation of the NHS. </p> <p>To underline Labour's determination to recapture public confidence after sustained criticism of poor services and long waiting lists, Tony Blair will be taking personal responsibility for the NHS. The prime minister will make a Commons statement on health today explaining how he and the health secretary, Alan Milburn, will spearhead the public debate about the future of the NHS and ensure the government gets the best value for Mr Brown's billions. </p> <p>Last night the prime minister met healthcare professionals and told them that today he would be setting out plans to publish more tables highlighting the vastly different costs of operations from region to region, outlining increased powers for nurses and a further tranche of cash for preventive and primary care. </p> <p>The chancellor said the 6.1% a year real increase in spending was the reward for his disciplined handling of the economy, which he expects to grow robustly over the next three years despite the impact of the strong pound on manufacturing. With the economy in its ninth year of sustained growth, Mr Brown said he would have a budget surplus of \u00a312bn this year, \u00a315bn better than he expected a year ago. Next year, even after the extra spending, the surplus will still be \u00a36bn, leaving plenty of scope for pre-election tax cuts or further spending increases. </p> <p>\"We have been prudent for a purpose. New money we can provide because we have made our choice: a Budget that unites the whole country, a Budget for all our people,\" Mr Brown said. </p> <p>Treasury officials strongly denied that the chancellor had been panicked into a spending spree, although many at Westminster believed that the move reflected the direct intervention of the prime minister to twist Mr Brown's arm. </p> <p>While health was the most eye-catching announcement in the Budget, there was also an extra \u00a31bn for education, to allow David Blunkett to hand up to \u00a39,000 for primary schools and up to \u00a350,000 to secondary schools. </p> <p>More money for transport and combating crime mopped up the rest of Mr Brown's \u00a34bn boost to public spending, which dwarfed tax cuts of just over \u00a31bn. </p> <p>The British Medical Association, often critical of Mr Blair, led a chorus of delight from within the NHS. \"We are delighted that the government has responded so quickly to our call for a fundamental review of health service funding. We see this as a first major step to putting the health service on a firm, long-term basis,\" said its chairman, Ian Bogle. </p> <p>Government sources said the increases would take health spending from \u00a349.3bn to \u00a368.7bn by 2004, equivalent to 7.6% of GDP and within touching distance of the European average of 8%. </p> <p>Despite Conservative scepticism about Mr Brown's figures, the sheer scale of the chancellor's commitment to \"a publicly funded NHS, true to the original principles of its founders\" took MPs on all sides by surprise. </p> <p>Cash spending will rise by 50% from \u00a31,850 a household to over \u00a32,800 by 2004. One Whitehall official said: \"This is a step change in the money available. Now we need a step change in the results we get from it.\" </p> <p>Some of the new money has been earmarked to wipe out \u00a3600m of accumulated NHS debts. </p> <p>With the four-year programme for increased health spending already agreed, the education department was set to become the big beneficiary of the chancellor's comprehensive review of other Whitehall spending. </p> <p>\"Education will be the big selling point in the summer. So David is smiling. I can't see how this can do anything but help,\" one of Mr Blunkett's ministerial colleagues said last night. </p> <p>Education spending had been set to increase by \u00a33.5bn over the coming financial year and yesterday's Budget raised this to \u00a34.5bn. Health spending had been due to rise by only \u00a32.9bn, but overtook education as a result of the chancellor's statement to get an increase of \u00a34.9bn. </p> <p>However, education ministers said last night that they were not losing out because their increase over this year's budget was 8.5%, while health got 7.9%. </p> <p>The eventual outcome would depend on the comprehensive spending review, but gains made by the health department would strengthen arguments for spending more on education.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Gordon Brown yesterday threw a \u00a32bn lifeline to the ailing NHS as part of a huge four-year boost to health spending designed to allay public concern over Labour's most vulnerable area in the run-up to the next election. After a winter of crisis in Britain's hospitals, Mr Brown opened his brimming war chest to bring forward part of his planned summer spending round. He pledged a 35% real increase in funds for the NHS by 2004, the biggest sustained increase in its 52-year history. The first fruits of the chancellor's surprise announcement - the centrepiece of his fourth Budget - will be a sustained drive to recruit 10,000 more nurses and better intensive care, but Mr Brown emphasised that the extra cash would have to be matched by reform and modernisation of the NHS. To underline Labour's determination to recapture public confidence after sustained criticism of poor services and long waiting lists, Tony Blair will be taking personal responsibility for the NHS. The prime minister will make a Commons statement on health today explaining how he and the health secretary, Alan Milburn, will spearhead the public debate about the future of the NHS and ensure the government gets the best value for Mr Brown's billions. Last night the prime minister met healthcare professionals and told them that today he would be setting out plans to publish more tables highlighting the vastly different costs of operations from region to region, outlining increased powers for nurses and a further tranche of cash for preventive and primary care. The chancellor said the 6.1% a year real increase in spending was the reward for his disciplined handling of the economy, which he expects to grow robustly over the next three years despite the impact of the strong pound on manufacturing. With the economy in its ninth year of sustained growth, Mr Brown said he would have a budget surplus of \u00a312bn this year, \u00a315bn better than he expected a year ago. Next year, even after the extra spending, the surplus will still be \u00a36bn, leaving plenty of scope for pre-election tax cuts or further spending increases. \"We have been prudent for a purpose. New money we can provide because we have made our choice: a Budget that unites the whole country, a Budget for all our people,\" Mr Brown said. Treasury officials strongly denied that the chancellor had been panicked into a spending spree, although many at Westminster believed that the move reflected the direct intervention of the prime minister to twist Mr Brown's arm. While health was the most eye-catching announcement in the Budget, there was also an extra \u00a31bn for education, to allow David Blunkett to hand up to \u00a39,000 for primary schools and up to \u00a350,000 to secondary schools. More money for transport and combating crime mopped up the rest of Mr Brown's \u00a34bn boost to public spending, which dwarfed tax cuts of just over \u00a31bn. The British Medical Association, often critical of Mr Blair, led a chorus of delight from within the NHS. \"We are delighted that the government has responded so quickly to our call for a fundamental review of health service funding. We see this as a first major step to putting the health service on a firm, long-term basis,\" said its chairman, Ian Bogle. Government sources said the increases would take health spending from \u00a349.3bn to \u00a368.7bn by 2004, equivalent to 7.6% of GDP and within touching distance of the European average of 8%. Despite Conservative scepticism about Mr Brown's figures, the sheer scale of the chancellor's commitment to \"a publicly funded NHS, true to the original principles of its founders\" took MPs on all sides by surprise. Cash spending will rise by 50% from \u00a31,850 a household to over \u00a32,800 by 2004. One Whitehall official said: \"This is a step change in the money available. Now we need a step change in the results we get from it.\" Some of the new money has been earmarked to wipe out \u00a3600m of accumulated NHS debts. With the four-year programme for increased health spending already agreed, the education department was set to become the big beneficiary of the chancellor's comprehensive review of other Whitehall spending. \"Education will be the big selling point in the summer. So David is smiling. I can't see how this can do anything but help,\" one of Mr Blunkett's ministerial colleagues said last night. Education spending had been set to increase by \u00a33.5bn over the coming financial year and yesterday's Budget raised this to \u00a34.5bn. Health spending had been due to rise by only \u00a32.9bn, but overtook education as a result of the chancellor's statement to get an increase of \u00a34.9bn. However, education ministers said last night that they were not losing out because their increase over this year's budget was 8.5%, while health got 7.9%. The eventual outcome would depend on the comprehensive spending review, but gains made by the health department would strengthen arguments for spending more on education.",

The benefit comes from the fall in basic rate tax, coupled with increases in personal allowances and the national insurance threshhold. </p> <p>But their gains will trickle away in \"stealth\" taxes such as the abolition of mortgage interest relief and the hefty tax bill they face if they move to a \u00a3250,000-plus dream home. </p> <p>Dinkies surfing the London property boom with a house purchase of \u00a3300,000 will be hit with a tax bill of \u00a39,000, \u00a31,500 more than last year, or more than enough to wipe out other tax gains.

While Max is pleased petrol duties have risen only in line with inflation, his estate car will miss out on the extension of the vehicle excise duty reduced rate for cars up to 1,200cc. The offer of 100% tax relief to any small business buying computers, or investing in e-commerce and new information technology might help to persuade Max to realise his dream of launching an online art auction. </p> <p>The couple, who are diligent savers, will enjoy the increase in next year's Isa limit to \u00a37,000 per person.</p> <p><strong>Lone pensioner</strong></p> <p>Michael O'Sullivan lives alone in a small village in Northern Ireland. The increase from \u00a35,720 to \u00a35,790 in the personal allowance for someone aged under 75 will make a small difference to his monthly income, together with the other income tax changes. It can get quite cold in the winter, so the \u00a350 increase to \u00a3150 a year in the winter allowance for fuel is an added bonus. The 25p increase in the price of cigarettes has annoyed him, but at least there is no increase in the duty on whisky. Michael spends most of his day watching TV and is looking forward to not having to pay his licence when he turns 75.</p> <p><strong>Married, one employed, one child</strong></p> <p>Bill and Alice Harford and their young daughter, who live comfortably on his doctor's salary of \u00a380,000, aren't too disappointed by yesterday's announcements. Their loss of the married couple's allowance and Miras has been offset by basic rate tax reductions. The family may postpone its decision to move house, since they would pay 4% stamp duty on the \u00a3500,000 home they had set their hearts on. The rises in petrol duties will cost them more to run their 5 series BMW, though there has been no change in vehicle excise duty. </p> <p>Otherwise, the Budget has been mostly good news: child benefit is increasing to \u00a315.50 from April 2001, Bill will enjoy a \u00a3100 tax cut when he electronically files his return to the inland revenue, and the family will pay less flight duty when they fly to their villa in Tuscany, if they fly economy rather than first class.</p> <p><strong>Married, two employed, two children</strong></p> <p>Wendy and Andy live in Middlesex with their twin daughters, Natalie and Nicola. Wendy teaches a dancercise class for tots and works in a children's clothing store.

The family are relieved, too, that the chancellor has not increased the tax on insurance policies - their household premiums are already set to rise following a recent claim.</p> <p><strong>Pensioner couple</strong></p> <p> Victor and Margaret Meldrew would not believe the chancellor's latest concession to drivers of green cars.

Finally, their children can look forward to a bigger inheritance following the increase in IHT threshold to \u00a3234,000. </p> <p><strong>Single, employed person</strong></p> <p> Andy is a coal miner who lives in south Yorkshire. Like most people, he will benefit from the marginal increase in the personal allowance, the reduction in the base rate of income tax to 22%, and changes in the national insurance banding. He is trying to give up smoking, so the 5% increase in the price of cigarettes may well be a blessing in disguise if he manages to give up. If he doesn't, as a 20-a-day smoker he will definitely feel the increase. Either way, the extra one pence on a pint of beer will make his nights out a touch more expensive. Andy is concerned about the future of his coal mine and, therefore, his job, but is encouraged by the government's plan to create action teams, matching the unemployed in the highest areas of unemployment with suitable vacancies in neighbouring areas.</p> <p><strong>Single parent, one child</strong></p> <p>Maddy brings up her baby Jack alone in London after they were abandoned by her partner Alex.

      "byline": "Gerard Lyons",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>This was a mixed Budget for the City and for the economy. The numbers were prudent, the speech was punchy but the detail was full of pot-holes. Even though the economy is in good shape, it faces a bumpy ride.</p> <p>The City wanted a tough Budget and got it. The worry is not the tax \"giveaway\", which was relatively prudent, but there is concern about the future trend on public spending, particularly if the economy slows. The Budget's tax changes will provide a net boost to the economy of \u00a31.2bn in the first year, a net \u00a32.6bn in the second year (2001/02) and \u00a32.5bn in the third year (2002/03).</p> <p>This contrasts with Gordon Brown's first two Budgets when he raised taxes significantly. Last year he gave away a small amount, although in the process many people were hit hard by targeted tax increases.</p> <p>The fiscal sums make sense. However, it is clear that political pressure is beginning to bite, with the chancellor relaxing the constraints on public spending. The main beneficiary is the health service. Public spending is now set to rise by an inflation-adjusted 2.5% per year. This summer's comprehensive spending review is likely to endorse this trend for the next three years. Because public spending has been kept under tight control in recent years the new trend on expenditure is not alarming. With a strong economy boosting revenues, the government's public sector net borrowing will be in surplus by \u00a311.9bn this year before falling.</p> <p>Although these numbers are credible it is worth stressing that the margin of error on the Treasury's numbers is high, averaging \u00a39bn per year over the past five years. Tax receipts are \u00a311.4bn higher than expected a year ago. Just as in the past year, the numbers could turn out dramatically different from those forecast. The key will be the strength of the economy.</p> <p>The Treasury is upbeat about economic prospects, and rightly so.

      "bodyText": "This was a mixed Budget for the City and for the economy. The numbers were prudent, the speech was punchy but the detail was full of pot-holes. Even though the economy is in good shape, it faces a bumpy ride. The City wanted a tough Budget and got it. The worry is not the tax \"giveaway\", which was relatively prudent, but there is concern about the future trend on public spending, particularly if the economy slows. The Budget's tax changes will provide a net boost to the economy of \u00a31.2bn in the first year, a net \u00a32.6bn in the second year (2001/02) and \u00a32.5bn in the third year (2002/03). This contrasts with Gordon Brown's first two Budgets when he raised taxes significantly. Last year he gave away a small amount, although in the process many people were hit hard by targeted tax increases. The fiscal sums make sense. However, it is clear that political pressure is beginning to bite, with the chancellor relaxing the constraints on public spending. The main beneficiary is the health service. Public spending is now set to rise by an inflation-adjusted 2.5% per year. This summer's comprehensive spending review is likely to endorse this trend for the next three years. Because public spending has been kept under tight control in recent years the new trend on expenditure is not alarming. With a strong economy boosting revenues, the government's public sector net borrowing will be in surplus by \u00a311.9bn this year before falling. Although these numbers are credible it is worth stressing that the margin of error on the Treasury's numbers is high, averaging \u00a39bn per year over the past five years. Tax receipts are \u00a311.4bn higher than expected a year ago. Just as in the past year, the numbers could turn out dramatically different from those forecast. The key will be the strength of the economy. The Treasury is upbeat about economic prospects, and rightly so. Last year, Standard Chartered was one of the few forecasters to get the British economy right and this year it expects 3.4% growth. The chancellor predicts economic growth around 3%, with domestic demand growing almost 4%. Within this good picture, it is clear that even the government is expecting a poor performance by manufacturing and a large deterioration in the trade deficit. The reason is simple: the pound is too strong. Clearly the City does not want Britain to join the euro, because that would lead to higher taxes and regulations, damaging investment and jobs.

But, with oil prices high and the economy strong, the likelihood is that rates could still increase again, to 6.5% by the summer.

The specific measures announced show the chancellor at his best and worst. He continues to meddle. Under the Conservatives there was a desire to simplify the tax system. Now there is an active decision to intervene. Fifty-nine tax changes were announced in the Budget. Some measures are good but it is doubtful that such continuous tinkering improves the efficiency of the economy. One worry for the City is the future direction of public finances. The time to undertake radical measures to address relentless upward pressure on public spending and on taxes is when the finances are in good shape. Instead, this is a classic pre-election Budget.

Nick Parsons at Commerzbank in London said that while the chancellor had signalled higher spending it was carefully focused. He said: \"People will feel good but they won't be much better off. The last thing the chancellor would want at this stage is a spending binge which would have to have to be countered by the Bank of England.\" Mr Parsons said he still expected to Bank's monetary policy committee to raise rates at some stage but not next month. \"I think a rate hike next month would signal unnecessary disapproval,\" he said. \"It is hard to find fault with it (the Budget).\" On the foreign exchanges the pound initially strengthened against the dollar before easing back from a high of $1.5773 to $1.5722, and sterling finished below its best level for the day against the euro, which closed at 61.69p after 62.09p. The pound lost ground as traders absorbed the implica tions of the chancellor's proposals and the growing belief that his spending proposals and tax cuts had not altered expectations about interest rates. The chancellor's message caused few ripples in the equities market, with the FTSE 100 share index standing at 6,606.09, down 17.6 points, when he began his Budget speech and ending the day at 6,620.3 for a fall on the day of just 4.2 points. \"Overall, it looks favourable in terms of the fiscal surplus he has projected. It seems he's keeping a fairly tight hand on fiscal policy,\" said Juli Collins-Thompson at BNP. \"Right now I would stick to our view that rates will probably peak at 6.5%, but this is an initial reaction.\" Fraser Coutts at 4cast agreed that rates were likely to peak at 6.5%. \"On the surface of things it's steady as she goes and there's nothing too much for the markets to concern themselves about,\" he said.",

From April next year, those aged over 25 and out of work for more than 18 months will have four New Deal options - work, work-based training, work experience in the voluntary sector or self employment. The chancellor said that staying at home on benefit doing nothing was not an option. Unemployed people refusing to take up one of the four options risk losing benefits, including the \u00a340 a week job seeker's allowance. Like the under 25s, the older, long-term unemployed will be entitled to help from a personal jobs adviser at their local jobs centre for up to four months. The Department for Education and Employment esti mates that about 150,000 people will benefit from the 25-plus scheme in its first year. Companies offering jobs under the New Deal programme to people aged 25 or over will be entitled to a government subsidy of \u00a375 a week per person for six months.

But Graham Finegold, chief executive of Workforce, a charity which helps people find the right job, said that if Mr Brown wanted to achieve his target of full employment he would have to address the requirements of people with special needs, who found it particularly difficult to get a job. Employment secretary David Blunkett said employment and windfall levy allocations of \u00a3455.5m would be phased in over the next two years to fund the extension of support to get people back to work. \"A strong, stable economy and our welfare to work programmes helped cut unemployment to a 20-year low and halved youth unemployment,\" he said. \"We have begun to transform the welfare state from a dole delivery system into an engine of the economy. \"The Budget measures are the next step in that transformation - building on the success of the New Deal; intensifying job search for everyone on job-seekers allowance; modernising the welfare state to be delivered through a merged employment service and benefits agency and extending help to those who are economically inactive.\"",

      "bodyText": "Sweeping new measures against tax dodging are likely to sound the death-knell for offshore trusts and arm the Inland Revenue with powers to collect information on all savings accounts and investment income. Action against the trusts alone is estimated to net the chancellor \u00a3500 million. Mr Brown sweetened the pill of his anti-dodging crackdown by defying Brussels to abolish the 20% withholding tax paid by British residents on eurobond interest. This will please the City, as it comes at a time when Britain is fighting European Union attempts to end the existing tax-free status of eurobond interest paid in London to non-residents. But the decision came alongside moves that will effectively end the use of trusts, both on and offshore, for tax purposes. In parallel to this, Mr Brown announced a legislative package that will give the revenue the ability \"to collect routine information about the savings income of all individuals.\" The information will be shared with the tax authorities only of countries that establish reciprocal arrangements with Britain, but the law will be changed to make it easier to set up i such arrangements. Further changes will allow the Revenue to gather information solely for the use of tax authorities outside the EU; at present, such authorities can have only information the revenue has collected for its own use. The chancellor is fighting off plans for a Europe-wide withholding tax on investment income, arguing that sharing information by national tax authorities is the way to fight tax avoidance and evasion. On trusts, Mr Brown said he was moving to end \"avoidance of capital gains tax by individuals exploiting the tax rules for trusts\". The chancellor said he will save \u00a3200m from the ending of existing arrangements and protect a further \u00a3300m from arrangements that will not now take place. Ian Luder, head of the personal client group at accountants Arthur Andersen, said \"he's killed trusts - this takes away a lot of the remaining tax advantages\". Mr Luder said trusts would remain popular only for non-tax reasons, such as the protection of children's assets until they reach adulthood.",

Fraudulent benefit claims were draining \u00a3500 million annually from the Treasury, said Lord Grabiner, without taking account of the lost tax revenues.

      "bodyText": "Thanks to the already announced 1p cut in the basic rate of tax to 22p from this April and the inflation-linked increases in personal tax allowances, most people will be better off, despite the abolition of the married couples' allowance which took away \u00a3197 a year from married taxpayers. The well-heeled will benefit most, with a professional couple without children earning \u00a340,000 each gaining as much as \u00a3764. A single person earning \u00a340,000 will gain \u00a3382 a year, but a couple with two children and the same joint income would only be \u00a3269 better off. A single person earning \u00a320,000 will be \u00a3207 a year better off but, perversely, a single parent earning \u00a330,000 is worse off - losing \u00a348.60 because of the loss of the single parents' allowance and the one year delay in the introduction of the child's tax credit. Pensioners are also winners. A pensioner couple on a joint income of \u00a330,000 are \u00a3166 a year better off, while a single pensioner with income of \u00a320,000 will be \u00a3155 better off. And there was also some more cheering news for low income pensioners with a promise of a pensioners' credit with the aim of lifting the poorest out of poverty and protecting those with modest savings. Pensioners will have to wait until the next parliament to see just how they benefit as the DSS has first to launch a consultation exercise. But the chancellor said that the new credit should mean that a pensioner with income of less than \u00a3100 a week, or a couple with less than \u00a3150,would qualify for the new pension credit to boost their income In a further boost to low income pensioners, the capital limits which affect their entitlement to the minimum income guarantee, which has replaced income support for the elderly, will be doubled, though they will have to wait another year until that takes effect. From April 2001 the lower limit will be doubled so that they will be able to hold on to savings or pensions income of \u00a36,000 before there is any reduction. Half a million more of the elderly who were previously disqualified from claiming the extra money will be able to do so from next year, making them at least \u00a3250 a year better off. And the upper limit, above which there is no entitlement, will be increased from \u00a38,000 to \u00a312,000, so more pensioners will be able to hang on to more of their savings. From next year the amount pensioners receive as the minimum guaranteed income will also be increased. For single pensioners it will be worth a maximum of \u00a380, or \u00a390 if they are over Added to this pensioners will be pleased by the improved winter fuel payments will go up by \u00a350 to \u00a3150 next winter and the affordable warmth programme to install energy efficient heating. There is no commitment to link increases in the state pension to earnings, despite intense lobbying after this year's rise, linked to inflation, amounted to 75p.",

The additional spending will be on \"congestion hotspots\", but the bulk of the money will go on road building. This rep resents a change of emphasis by Mr Prescott and a belated response to the road lobby which has been pressing for further assistance. The pro-car stance was bolstered by moves to give the motorist greater incentives to switch to greener, leaner cars using ultra-low-sulphur fuels. Bowing to pressure from manufacturers to encourage people to buy cars, Gordon Brown raised duties on petrol and diesel by just under 2p a litre and froze vehicle excise duty at \u00a3155 until next March. Officials admitted the rise in the price of crude oil from $23 to $30 a barrel had already boosted petrol costs by 7p a litre since the last Budget - twice as much as the hated and now abolished fuel duty escalator would have given. The chancellor underlined his green credentials by giving a 1p discount for ultra-low-sulphur petrol and extending the \u00a355 discount for smaller cars to a further 2.2m owners. He also unveiled a graduated system for taxing new cars from next March, rewarding those running on cleaner, more fuel-efficient engines. But, notably avoiding the issue in his Commons speech, Mr Brown announced a radical reform of company car taxation that effectively penalises the high-mileage driver and rewards low-mileage users of fuel-efficient cars. Duty will rise to \u00a3160 next March but the present \u00a355 discount will be extended to 2.2m drivers of cars with a 1,200cc engine rather than the present ceiling of 1.1 litres, which applies to 1.8m owners. These new beneficiaries are said to include owners of 700,000 models of the Ford Fiesta, 200,000 Vauxhall Corsas, 200,000 Vauxhall Novas and 200,000 Renault Clios. From next March all new, Y-registered cars will go into four bands, with duty calculated according to their carbon dioxide emissions and offering a discount of up to \u00a370. That includes a \u00a310 bonus for cars using cleaner fuels and technology such as hybrid models, but a \u00a310 \"fine\" for diesel-powered cars, which emit more particulates. Cars in the lowest band, A - such as the Ford Focus - will pay as little as \u00a390 in duty while those in the highest, band D - such as the Peugeot 406 - could pay up to \u00a3160. Lord Macdonald, the transport minister, said the driver vehicle licensing agency would soon launch a campaign to persuade motorists that \"driving a more fuel-efficient ve hicle will cut their vehicle excise duty and fuel bills as well as helping the environment\". He added that motorists would save almost \u00a3250m through the tax changes during the coming year. Consultants also warned that business motorists driving high mileages faced a real \"hit\" under the proposed reform of company car taxation. Mr Brown plans to switch from April 2002 to a system based on a car's emission rather than that at present, based on mileage discounts. The latter had unintentionally given incentives to drive more business miles, up to 300m a year, to gain bigger discounts. Under the new system the charge will build up from 15% of the car's price for low-emission models to a maximum of 35%.

Sustained lobbying from female Labour MPs, led by Calder Valley MP Chris McCafferty, persuaded the chancellor to introduce the change, which ends the policy of treating tampons and sanitary towels as luxury items incurring the full 17.5% VAT rate. The tax will be cut from next January to just 5% - the lowest possible under European rules limiting the goods that can be zero-rated. However, while Mr Brown conceded the reduction, worth \u00a335m a year, women MPs were amused to find that he could not be persuaded to utter the words \"sanitary protection\" in the Commons chamber. \"We tried to get him to say 'sanpro',\" said one MP. \"But even that didn't seem to appeal.\" Instead, details of the tax cut were referred to in accompanying Budget documents and coyly pointed out by Treasury aides after the chancellor's address. Challenged over Mr Brown's inexplicable failure to mention the change, which comes after decades of campaigning by women's pressure groups, one adviser said: \"Female treasury ministers have worked very hard on this and Gordon decided to let them take the credit.\" The move was welcomed by Asda, which has been pressing for a reduction in the price of sanitary items. The chain, which has not charged customers VAT on sanitary products for more than a year, preferring to shoulder the tax itself, said it was delighted.",

According to the projections, Italy is expected to lose 28% of its population by 2050, the steepest decline of the countries covered by the report. It would need 6,500 immigrants for every million inhabitants to maintain the worker-pensioner ratio. Otherwise the retirement age would need to rise to 77. Japan, where the proportion of foreigners is barely 1%, would need 5,000 immigrants for every million inhabitants each year just to stand still. The population unit studied eight low-birthrate countries for the report: the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, South Korea and the United States. It also looked at the European Union and Europe. The UK would be able to keep its population steady up to 2050 by raising immigration from an average of 73,000 a year to 88,000. \"However, the number of migrants needed to keep the population in working-age constant are about twice the level of the past decade,\" said the report. Without immigrants the retirement age would have to rise to 72 to maintain the ratio of workers to pensioners. Overall, the population of the 15 countries of the EU, which now stands at more than 375m people, is expected to fall to 330m by 2050. The population of the US, by contrast, is projected to grow from just under 280m now to almost 350m in 50 years. The report said that governments should consider the age they set for retirement, the benefits they want to provide to the elderly, and their immigration policies. But not everyone accepts the premise of the study. Paul Demeny, of the Population Council think-tank in New York, said a declining population was not necessarily a problem. Fertility rates could also rise again. \"These affluent societies, Europe, Japan, North America, have plenty of economic potential to adjust to these relatively slow-moving changes without courting economic disaster,\" he said.",

The Taiwanese parliament also dropped the formal legal ban on direct trade links with the mainland. But in Beijing, a spokesman countered by repeating China's formal position that Taiwan was a part of \"One China\". And in a statement that appeared to reinforce China's rigid opposition to Taiwan's independence, the Chinese premier, Zhu Rongji, said yesterday that Beijing would never negotiate with anyone advocating independence for the island. However, the US special envoy Richard Holbrooke, who was visiting Beijing, said he had held \"constructive talks\" covering the Taiwan issue with China's foreign minister, Tang Jiaxuan.

Hindu villages are guarded by security patrols, but not the Sikh villages, which until now seemed to need no protection. Yesterday a senior Indian official, Brajesh Mishra, said that New Delhi had evidence that militants linked to Pakistan were responsible, though he refused to identify his sources. He named Lashkar-e-Toiba, led by Abu Mahaz, as the perpetrator, in a combined operation with Hizbul Mojahedin. But militant leaders in Pakistan rejected the charge. \"The brutal mass murder\" on the eve of the Clinton visit was a \"pre-planned act of Indian intelligence to defame the Kashmiri freedom struggle\", said Syed Salahuddin, head of Hizbul Mojahedin. \"The mojahedin have nothing against the Sikh community, which sympathises with our struggle. We assure them that there never was and there will never be any danger to Sikhs from Kashmiri freedom fighters.\" President Clinton, who admitted that the US had \"neglected\" its relationship with India during the last two decades, laid a wreath yesterday with his daughter Chelsea at a memorial to Mahatma Gandhi, before official talks and a state banquet last night. He moves on to visit the Taj Mahal today, and a tiger reserve in Rajasthan tomorrow.",

The men spent \u00a325,000 to set up the the Ostrich Farming Corporation Ltd - but took almost \u00a322m from investors in less than 18 months. More than 2,000 people were persuaded to part with their cash by glossy brochures promising high returns from what was billed as the meat of the future. Investors' money was allegedly siphoned into offshore accounts, then laundered through bogus companies. The businessmen set up the firm based near Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, to sell ostriches as an investment opportunity. Investors were invited to buy chicks for \u00a3500 or adult birds costing up to \u00a314,000. The birds would then be micro-chipped with the owner's details and reared on a specialist farm in Belgium before being sold as meat. But Julian Baughan, QC, prosecuting, said the accused men had \"cheated the public, to get money out of them, by telling lies.\" He added: \"It is a tribute to the success of this fraud that so many members of the public were induced to invest in it. To give the scheme a personal touch investors were told that the birds would be micro-chipped with the details of the investor. \"There would also be regular reports prepared of each birds' progress and its progeny.\" The company promised high returns because of a predicted growing demand for ostrich meat. Mr Baughan said more than 2,200 investors paid the company almost \u00a322m. He said 80% of the revenue was received by the company in five months. \"It was a wall of money,\" he told the jury. The men had no experience of ostriches or farming and none had ever owned an ostrich. While some ostriches were bought and raised on the farm in Belgium, millions of pounds were siphoned into offshore accounts, said Mr Baughan. To make the money difficult for the investors to trace, it went through other companies registered offshore. Mr Baughan said the Ostrich Farming Corporation paid \u00a37.5m to Wallstreet, a firm set up in the Cayman Islands by one of the accused men. Other firms were launched called Company Administration and Jarvis Marketing to pay the corporation's sales force. But the companies were also used to further \"filter away investors' money\" and then to be plundered by the accused men, claimed Mr Baughan. He said documents of various transactions between the intermediary companies were found during an investigation by accountants employed by the Serious Fraud Office. Four of the businessmen are in the dock but the fifth is absent due to ill health and may be tried later. The jury was told that he was a bankrupt who allegedly set up accounts in the name of his unsuspecting 85-year-old mother to launder cash. All five men have denied conspiracy to defraud between December 1994 and April 1996. Brian Ketchell, 49, of Newark, Nottinghamshire, allegedly made \u00a31.356m. Allan Walker, 57, also of Newark, is alleged to have dishonestly made \u00a31.367m. Kevin Jones, 41, of Barnsley, South Yorkshire, is alleged to have made \u00a32.1m and his brother Russell Jones, 42, of Doncaster, South Yorkshire, allegedly made \u00a3700,000. The absent fifth defendant is alleged to have made \u00a31.19m. The Ostrich Farming Corporation was wound up by the courts in April 1996. The trial is expected to last at least 14 weeks.",

She thinks the war on drugs is a waste of time and money. Her heroes are the demonstrators who brought the World Trade Organisation to a standstill in Seattle. Her enemies are the Republican party establishment. She reckons poor people and black people in America should rise up and demand their rights. She's angry as hell.</p> <p>This is not some fugitive member of an urban guerrilla group issuing her manifesto. This is Arianna Stassinopolous Huffington, once the queen-pin of the Republican establishment, once a conservative Washington political wife, once a cheerleader for House leader Newt Gingrich and his rightwing Republican Revolution and, in a previous life, the first foreign president of the Cambridge Union, berater of feminism and advocate of New Age spirituality.</p> <p>Her political transformation from the conservative right to the opposite side of the spectrum has infuriated some of her former allies, won her a new loyal battalion of friends on the left and given her one of the highest profiles of any woman in American politics. Currently, she is crisscrossing the country brandishing copies of her Overthrow the Government manifesto. So what has happened?</p> <p>The scene is the Bergamot Station, a community and arts centre in Santa Monica, the liberal heartland of Los Angeles. Around 150 people have gathered to catch half an hour of Arianna - the first name is all that is necessary - talking about her new book and answering questions. It will only be half an hour because then she's off to the television studios for another interview, then Washington, then, well, everywhere. Everyone wants Arianna on their show or at their party these days. As the presidential race slips down a couple of gears after the departure of John McCain, there is a gaping political vacuum to be filled - and who better to fill it than Mrs Huffington?</p> <p>The tall, slim, elegant figure with the trademark red hair takes to the platform with the ease born of many years as a television pundit.

No wonder half of the electorate didn't bother last time. The United States has become \"two nations\", with a shocking 36m people living in poverty. \"The whole other America is not part of the political debate.\" Yes, it's good, she says, that McCain had raised the issue of campaign reform - trying to limit the way that big business funds political campaigns in return for later favours - but really, he had too easy a ride from the media, who had been \"making goo-goo eyes at him\".</p> <p>The book she is promoting, Overthrow the Government, is a 300-page spin through the current political scene.

She helped Huffington win office as a carpetbagging Republican congressman in Santa Barbara, California, by spending a then record $5.4m on campaigning. This was followed by an even more expensive ($30m) but ill-fated bid for a Senate seat in 1994 by Huffington against the liberal incumbent, Diane Feinstein. In the meantime, Arianna became one of Washington's best-known hostesses and there was even talk of Michael Huffington seeing if he could buy his way into the White House. But there was no comeback after the disastrous Senate race and, in 1998, the couple parted, with Michael, following years of \"no comments\" on his sexuality, coming out as gay. He has now joined the Democrats.</p> <p>Apart from all the politics and the parties, Arianna wrote six books, including biographies of Maria Callas and Aristotle Onassis, both accused of plagiarism. She became a syndicated columnist, a talk show regular, and a television satirist. She had also been been associated with John Roger, the controversial leader of the Movement for Spiritual Awareness. Her friends admired her energy, generosity and determination. Her enemies saw her as calculating, manipulative and ferociously ambitious, the real puff behind Michael Huffington and \"the most upwardly mobile Greek since Icarus\".</p> <p>Then came her dramatic disillusionment. She left Washington with her two young daughters for Brentwood in Los Angeles, started holding the most glittering of the area's political salons, throwing book launch parties for the likes of Jesse Jackson and Jesse Ventura, the wrestler-turned-governor of Minnesota, and effectively sparking off the idea of actor-director Warren Beatty running for president to promote the progressive agenda. Now comes the new book and a call to people to engage in acts of civil disobedience and take to the streets.</p> <p>Arianna says that anyone who has been reading her columns over the past five years will know that what has happened to her thinking is \"no overnight flip-flop\", that she considered herself \"fooled, seduced, blinded\" by Gingrich and that she now has no political heroes at all. Her move came partly, she says, when she realised that the super-rich were happy to put their hands in their pockets for a fashionable museum or for the opera, but less interested in wanting to help the homeless and impoverished. So is she serious?</p> <p>Marc Cooper, who writes for the country's main radical weekly, the Nation, and broadcasts daily on LA's most radical radio station, KPFK, reckons she is very much for real. \"Arianna is no dummy and no dilettante. Her politics have always been iconoclastic. Yes, she was a conservative Republican but there was always a quirkiness to it.\" She had always shown a concern about the poor, he said: \"It might have been noblesse oblige but it was certainly not, 'Let them eat cake.' If you read her columns over the last few years, you will see a consistent political journey from knee-jerk Republican towards a kind of progressive populist position. Her commitment is real. She doesn't close the door at night and have a good laugh and say, 'That will have sold some books.' She is a great listener, her mind is open, she is not afraid to revise her opinion and she's taking risks.\"</p> <p>David Corn is the Washington editor of the Nation. He met Arianna half a dozen years ago when she was still committed to the so-called Republican Revolution which claimed it would see the poor being empowered by their policies. \"I wasn't favourably impressed. I thought she was trying to ride that wave.\" Then, says Corn, she started challenging the Republican establishment over its failure to deliver. \"She showed a certain amount of backbone, but backbone is easier to have if you're married to a millionaire.\"</p> <p>Corn, who had been relentless in his attacks on Gingrich, started getting calls from her congratulating him on his broadsides at the time that her marriage was starting to unravel and she was moving to Los Angeles. \"She got a physical distance from the Republican crowd and kept following this path of thinking what was wrong with the system.\" Corn reckons she has the typical \"fervour of the convert, particularly an intelligent convert ... she became quite passionate in her advocacy and did not shy away from the obvious conclusions.\" Both Corn and Cooper say she is putting her money where her mouth is, channelling funds to organisations she supports.</p> <p>Ellen Miller of Public Campaign, which was set up in 1997 to campaign for full public funding of politicians so that they would be removed from the corruption of the corporate backing, is also an Arianna admirer: \"She's an extremely capable and intelligent woman and she's extremely important to us.\" As a former big-name Republican, she gives the campaign an extra credibility and is one of the 100 members of its advisory board.</p> <p>Bob Scheer, who writes from the left in the LA Times and who shared a platform with her at the Santa Monica event, also admires Arianna's change of heart - although, as a Democrat, he does not buy the notion of everyone starting new parties and taking to the streets. She could, suggests political writer Joe Conason in his review of her book, become \"California's answer to Jesse Ventura, especially if everyone remembers to forget about the past\".</p> <p>Not everyone is impressed. The Nation columnist Katha Pollitt has accused Arianna of \"repackaging\" herself. To which Corn has replied: \"Some lefties, alas, would rather have targets than allies, maintain enemies rather than welcome converts.\" Other critics find her solutions facile. They cite her west coast New Agery - \"think of family volunteering as aerobics for the soul\" - and her suggestions to people to \"start a new party\" as if that were a simple solution to the crisis in American politics. Her old Republican allies regard her as an \"opportunistic turncoat\", says Corn.

Would she really fancy being governor of California? How big a part does she want to play? She is not yet 50 - her announcement of an impending birthday in July at the Santa Monica meeting drew appreciative gasps - and she has the media at her feet.

      "bodyText": "She wants to overthrow the government. She wants people to take to the streets in acts of civil disobedience and organise boycotts of big corporations. She thinks the war on drugs is a waste of time and money. Her heroes are the demonstrators who brought the World Trade Organisation to a standstill in Seattle. Her enemies are the Republican party establishment. She reckons poor people and black people in America should rise up and demand their rights. She's angry as hell. This is not some fugitive member of an urban guerrilla group issuing her manifesto. This is Arianna Stassinopolous Huffington, once the queen-pin of the Republican establishment, once a conservative Washington political wife, once a cheerleader for House leader Newt Gingrich and his rightwing Republican Revolution and, in a previous life, the first foreign president of the Cambridge Union, berater of feminism and advocate of New Age spirituality. Her political transformation from the conservative right to the opposite side of the spectrum has infuriated some of her former allies, won her a new loyal battalion of friends on the left and given her one of the highest profiles of any woman in American politics. Currently, she is crisscrossing the country brandishing copies of her Overthrow the Government manifesto. So what has happened? The scene is the Bergamot Station, a community and arts centre in Santa Monica, the liberal heartland of Los Angeles. Around 150 people have gathered to catch half an hour of Arianna - the first name is all that is necessary - talking about her new book and answering questions. It will only be half an hour because then she's off to the television studios for another interview, then Washington, then, well, everywhere. Everyone wants Arianna on their show or at their party these days. As the presidential race slips down a couple of gears after the departure of John McCain, there is a gaping political vacuum to be filled - and who better to fill it than Mrs Huffington? The tall, slim, elegant figure with the trademark red hair takes to the platform with the ease born of many years as a television pundit. Her theme tonight is the collapse of respect for the body politic and the need for everyone to get out there, break with conventional politics and, if necessary, break some laws while they do so. The presidential race has become a \"demolition derby\", she says; voters have a choice between \"the pro-life corporation party and the pro-choice corporation party\". No wonder half of the electorate didn't bother last time.

He was taken to hospital with an irregular heartbeat and discharged after four days. </p> <p>The court had heard that the three-year-old terrier, Ria, who weighed two pounds, was the pet of Alexandria East, six, of Mumbles, near Swansea. The dog had to be put down. </p> <p>In a statement yesterday Mr Ace, who had told the court he had been trying to defend himself after the dog bit him, said he was delighted the RSPCA had dropped a prosecution he believed should never have been brought. </p> <p>\"I have maintained that my actions were reasonable,\" he said. \"The dog was aggressive and on occasions out of control. I regret that the dog died. It was never my intention, and I again offer my sympathies to the owners, who were understandably distraught.\" </p> <p>Alexandria's father, Neil East, had told magistrates that he approached Mr Ace to get the dog, which was barking around his feet, but he kicked her hard. </p> <p>The post office said no further action would be taken against Mr Ace. - Geoffrey Gibbs</p> <p> <b>Four held over acid attack</b></p> <p>Police were yesterday questioning four men in connection with a doorstep acid attack four years ago that left a teenage babysitter scarred for life. Beverley Hammett was 19 when concentrated nitric acid was thrown in her face, almost blinding her, as she answered the door of a house in Seaton, Devon in July 1996. </p> <p>She was babysitting for the owner, Susan Humphrey, whom police believe was the intended victim. </p> <p>Mrs Humphrey's estranged husband Peter Humphrey, who was said to be obsessively jealous, denied involvement but was jailed for 12 years at Exeter crown court in March 1998 after a jury found him guilty of aiding and abetting a person or persons unknown to cause grievous bodily harm to his wife. His appeal against conviction was rejected. </p> <p>The four men were arrested early yesterday in a joint operation by officers from Devon and Cornwall, Avon and Somerset and North Wales police. </p> <p>A man of 51 was arrested in Seaton. Two others, aged 47 and 28, were picked up at separate addresses in Yeovil. A 28-year-old man from Holyhead was also detained. - Geoffrey Gibbs </p> <p> <b>Motorbikes 'ruining rare habitats'</b></p> <p>A leading wildlife agency yesterday criticised motorcycle scramblers who turned rare wildlife habitats into a \"lunar landscapes\". </p> <p>English Nature said off-road motorcycles had damaged large areas of several sites of special scientific interest - protected areas of countryside. It welcomed government plans to tackle the problem of third party damage to SSSIs in the countryside and rights of way bill, which yesterday got a second reading in the Commons. </p> <p>English Nature's chairwoman, Lady Young of Old Scone, said: \"These proposed powers are just what we have been pushing for. </p> <p>\"Problems often arise on SSSIs which are common land where people are mistaken in thinking they can do what they like. This is a great improvement to the current system.\" </p> <p>The agency said off-road motorcycling had damaged large areas of several SSSIs over recent months including two important heathlands in Berkshire and Bedfordshire. </p> <p>Parts of these two sites had been reduced to a lunar landscape of bare earth and mud by continuous motorcycle scrambling, it said. </p> <p>Owners and land managers of SSSIs around the country also faced arson, abandonment of vehicles and fly-tipping. Under the bill, damaging an SSSI would be an offence, English Nature said. </p> <p>Currently the agency has to apply for a nature conservation order before action can be taken. </p> <p> <b>Orkney gets huge wind generators</b></p> <p>Construction of what will be Britain's tallest wind generator began yesterday on Burgar Hill in Orkney. </p> <p>The machine, one of two being built on the site, will stand on a 215ft tower and have a 236ft propeller. </p> <p>Getting the components for the turbines, manufactured in Denmark, to Burgar Hill from Kirkwall involves the biggest road haulage operation ever undertaken on the Orkney islands. Road junctions have had to be altered and corners widened along the 20-mile route. </p> <p>The two machines, able to generate a quarter of Orkney's electricity needs, are due to be operational in May, but building work, by the Danish company NEG Micon, has to be completed before rare red-throated divers start nesting on a nature reserve of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. </p> <p> <b>Solicitor's \u00a3175,000 theft spree</b></p> <p>A solicitor who stole more than \u00a3175,000 from his clients to fund his passion for luxury cars has been jailed for three years and eight months. </p> <p>Stuart Nelson, 48, raided the accounts set up for the beneficiaries of mainly elderly widows while executing their wills and holding power of attorney over their affairs. </p> <p>The cars he bought included a Bentley Turbo for \u00a348,000 and a Jaguar XJ12 for \u00a329,338 during his five-year spree. Nelson initially denied 15 charges of stealing a total of \u00a3299,367, but his trial earlier this month was halted when he changed his plea to guilty to 10 charges of theft totalling \u00a3178,930. </p> <p>A jury at Norwich crown court was discharged from giving verdicts on the remaining five charges of theft and they were ordered to remain on file. Judge David Mellor told him on Monday that he had \"besmirched\" his profession and brought disgrace and hardship on himself and his family. </p> <p>He added: \"You devoted much of your professional skills to pillaging clients' accounts and covering your tracks over a substantial period of years.\" </p> <p>The judge said that Nelson's depression was not an excuse for the thefts and an aggravating feature was that the crimes were carefully planned. </p> <p>Nelson, a married father of two who was also a scoutmaster, earned \u00a333,000 a year as a salaried partner with the law firm Metcalfe, Copeman and Pettefar in King's Lynn, Norfolk. </p> <p>Nelson was dismissed from the firm where he had worked for 24 years after auditors discovered his financial irregularities. The firm said all those cheated had been reimbursed by the company's insurers.</p>",

This is a great improvement to the current system.\" The agency said off-road motorcycling had damaged large areas of several SSSIs over recent months including two important heathlands in Berkshire and Bedfordshire. Parts of these two sites had been reduced to a lunar landscape of bare earth and mud by continuous motorcycle scrambling, it said. Owners and land managers of SSSIs around the country also faced arson, abandonment of vehicles and fly-tipping. Under the bill, damaging an SSSI would be an offence, English Nature said. Currently the agency has to apply for a nature conservation order before action can be taken. Orkney gets huge wind generators Construction of what will be Britain's tallest wind generator began yesterday on Burgar Hill in Orkney. The machine, one of two being built on the site, will stand on a 215ft tower and have a 236ft propeller. Getting the components for the turbines, manufactured in Denmark, to Burgar Hill from Kirkwall involves the biggest road haulage operation ever undertaken on the Orkney islands. Road junctions have had to be altered and corners widened along the 20-mile route. The two machines, able to generate a quarter of Orkney's electricity needs, are due to be operational in May, but building work, by the Danish company NEG Micon, has to be completed before rare red-throated divers start nesting on a nature reserve of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. Solicitor's \u00a3175,000 theft spree A solicitor who stole more than \u00a3175,000 from his clients to fund his passion for luxury cars has been jailed for three years and eight months. Stuart Nelson, 48, raided the accounts set up for the beneficiaries of mainly elderly widows while executing their wills and holding power of attorney over their affairs. The cars he bought included a Bentley Turbo for \u00a348,000 and a Jaguar XJ12 for \u00a329,338 during his five-year spree. Nelson initially denied 15 charges of stealing a total of \u00a3299,367, but his trial earlier this month was halted when he changed his plea to guilty to 10 charges of theft totalling \u00a3178,930. A jury at Norwich crown court was discharged from giving verdicts on the remaining five charges of theft and they were ordered to remain on file. Judge David Mellor told him on Monday that he had \"besmirched\" his profession and brought disgrace and hardship on himself and his family. He added: \"You devoted much of your professional skills to pillaging clients' accounts and covering your tracks over a substantial period of years.\" The judge said that Nelson's depression was not an excuse for the thefts and an aggravating feature was that the crimes were carefully planned. Nelson, a married father of two who was also a scoutmaster, earned \u00a333,000 a year as a salaried partner with the law firm Metcalfe, Copeman and Pettefar in King's Lynn, Norfolk. Nelson was dismissed from the firm where he had worked for 24 years after auditors discovered his financial irregularities. The firm said all those cheated had been reimbursed by the company's insurers.",

Ampleforth abbey in North Yorkshire has decided to close its dairy unit and sell its 190 cows because of falling milk prices. A report last week warned that the dairy industry was facing \"meltdown\" because of the price of milk, which has fallen by a third in three years and is at its lowest since records began in 1970. The Ampleforth herd, once said to be the largest under one roof in the north-east, produced milk and the Abbey brand of yoghurt for consumption at the abbey and its famous school, Ampleforth college. Produce from the farm, which has been operating for nearly 100 years, was also sold to the public. Peter Bryan, procurator at the abbey, said the operation had to close. Since demand from the monks and the school had declined and milk prices were falling, losses were forecast to continue. In the past four years more than 4,200 dairy farms have gone out of production - 16% of the UK's total. Farmers receive an average of less than 10p a pint, with consumers paying around 34p. \u0095 Nearly 100 West Country farmers picketed the Unigate distribution plant in Totnes, Devon, yesterday in protest at the low milk price for dairy farmers. The picket, organised by rogue farmers' union Farmers for Action, allowed tankers to enter, but only deliveries for schools were allowed to leave the plant, which produces 300m litres of milk a year. The organiser, Richard Haddock, said: \"Farmers are only getting 15p per litre of milk.

      "bodyText": "The long term confinement of the hard core of Britain's most dangerous prisoners in solitary punishment cells is jeopardising their mental health and making them more disruptive, according to a report published today by the chief inspector of prisons. Sir David Ramsbotham said the two year experiment in the creation of two close supervision centres, or special units, at Woodhill prison, near Milton Keynes, and at Durham prison had produced mixed results. While a small group of 11 had conformed and progressed, a much larger group, involving about 30 inmates, had continued to resist and their behaviour had worsened. An official inspection report on the special units published today also revealed that seven \"high control cells\" have been established in Britain's maximum security prisons in which the most disruptive inmates are given a \"56 day lie-in\" as punishment or simply to give relief to staff. The director general of the prison service, Martin Narey, last night justified the practice, saying it was having to deal with a small number of inmates who had murdered other prisoners, in one case had killed a member of staff, and who continually assaulted other inmates and took hostages. \"We need to find a way of holding them in conditions which are acceptable and which do not reward outrageous and dangerous behaviour,\" he said. \"No other country has yet managed to solve this problem.\" The chief inspector said there was a question mark over whether the legal powers existed to hold inmates for up to 56 days in those conditions. His report questioned the legality of the isolation of inmates in the Woodhill special unit in similar punishment cells for indefinite periods. So far 53 prisoners have been detained in such conditions, in one case for 206 days at Woodhill where the period of isolation is open-ended. The main fear of those involved was reported to be \"losing their minds\", and the inspection report recommended that the unlimited isolation of inmates in punishment cells should cease. The prisoners involved are locked up for 23 hours a day in a basic cell with a mattress on a raised concrete plinth, cardboard furniture, a sink, toilet and a small mirror. No contact is allowed with other prisoners and they are not even allowed a radio. All contact with the outside world is through a hatch in the door and when they are unlocked for exercise they are met by six officers in full riot gear. \"They do not have human contact with staff except for people in riot gear,\" Sir David said yesterday. The close supervision centres were set up in 1998 with the aim of combining containment with therapy. They replaced the prison service \"merry-go-round\" under which the most difficult inmates were kept in perpetual solitary confinement by being shunted from one jail to another every 28 days. But the chief inspector's report made it clear that although the staff in Woodhill CSC were highly professional, they had so far been unable to address clinical mental health needs. Staff at Woodhill had \"weathered extreme challenges to their authority in the early months, and at the time of our inspection were divided in their belief that the system could succeed with some prisoners. \"In contrast, the staff at Durham's I wing had grown in confidence, as they managed to build an impressive unit for CSC prisoners with acknowledged mental health needs,\" the inspection report said. Inmates who make progress at Woodhill \"graduate\" to the I wing at Durham in the hope they will be transferred eventually to the main prison system. Mr Narey said the prison service would amend the rules to clarify the legality of the use of segregation but he was confident a legal challenge from the prisoners would not succeed in the courts. He said the special units had proved successful for two prisoners who had been returned to the main prison system and for a further seven who were also on the brink of being transferred. \"No other country has found the answer to this problem. In the close supervision centres we have only 40 prisoners, in the United States they have more than 18,000 in such conditions.\" Danger criminals in the special units Charles Bronson has spent the past 26 years in prison for armed robbery, of which 22 have been in solitary confinement after repeated hostage taking, twice leading rooftop protests, and more than 20 assaults on officers.

Whatever their doubts about New Labour, members and activists swallowed everything from the rewriting of Clause IV to the Blair-Brown pledge not to raise income tax, because they were hungry for the electoral success Mr Blair seemed to know how to bring.</p> <p>But now there are concerns that New Labour is not a guarantor of electoral success after all. First it was Wales where Tony Blair's nominee, Alun Michael, failed to win a majority. Then it was Europe when a non-campaign gave the Tories their first nationwide success since 1992. Over the past few weeks the party has come third in two byelections in a row.</p> <p>It may well be that to win elections in a modern white-collar society, Labour has to extend its appeal beyond its traditional working-class heartlands into the ever-growing middle class. But, the doubters are arguing, Labour cannot expect to keep on winning elections if, in apparently endlessly massaging the concerns of the middle class, the party forgets its appeal to \"core\" working-class supporters.</p> <p>Claims that Labour has lost touch with its traditional vote have rested on what has been happening in predominantly working-class constituencies. When the party crashed to defeat in Europe and Wales, it lost most heavily in working-class areas. In the European elections last year, Labour's vote fell on average by 20 points in predominantly working-class seats, whereas in middle-class seats the drop was just 11 points. The Welsh strongholds of Rhondda and Islwyn were symbolically lost to Plaid Cymru.</p> <p>Evidence from the British election panel survey (Beps) adds weight on the doubters' side. This survey, financed by the Economic and Social Research Council, is interviewing a panel of more than 2,000 voters on a regular basis throughout the course of this parliament. The switches of allegiance it throws up have been dramatic.</p> <p>For all Labour's attempts to appeal to the middle class, it remained a recognisably working-class party in 1997. No less than 49% of the Beps panel in working-class occupations turned out for Labour, compared with just 34% of those in top salaried occupations. The class gap in Labour support had narrowed but the party still appealed more strongly to the working class.</p> <p>Yet when Labour crashed to defeat in the 1999 European elections, it had lost its traditional class profile entirely. The party was no more successful at getting working- class voters to back it at the polls than it was middle-class ones. Just 12% of those in working-class occupations turned out for Labour while 13% of those in top salaried occupations did so.</p> <p>Where did these lost working-class Labour voters go? Some of them stayed at home. No less than 75% of working class Beps panellists did not vote in the European parliamentary elections, compared with just 60% of those in salaried occupations. True, working-class voters were less likely to turn out in 1997 too, but what was a 9 point gap in abstention rates widened to 15 points in 1999. Overall, no less than 65% of those who backed Labour in 1997 stayed at home compared with just 54% of Conservatives.</p> <p>So why did traditional Labour voters stay at home? The answer appears to be because they do not consider New Labour to be radical enough. For example, Beps panellists were asked what they thought about income redistribution. Did the government need to put greater effort into making people's incomes more equal or not? As well as asking them what they believed, they were also asked what they thought Labour's policy on redistribution was. This enabled us to identity three groups of people. One comprises those who think Labour's views on redistribution are the same as theirs. Another consists of those who think that Labour is less keen on redistribution than they themselves are. And the third contains those who think Labour is more keen on redistribution than themselves.</p> <p>It turns out that Labour's problem is not that large sections of the electorate have become keener on redistribution than they think Labour are. True, this group comprises 35% of voters in 1999 compared with just 29% in 1997. But those at the other end of the spectrum, that is who are less keen on redistribution than Labour, are at 43% not only still more numerous but they have also risen somewhat from 40% in 1997.</p> <p>Rather Labour's problem is with those who are keener on redistribution than they believe the party is. Apparently they no longer see any particular merit in backing Labour. In 1997, such \"leftwing\" voters were far more likely to turn out for Labour than were those who felt Labour were keener on redistribution than themselves - by 44% to 25%. But in 1999 \"leftwing\" voters, more common among the working class, were barely more likely to back Labour than were those on the \"right\" - just 10% to 9%.</p> <p>New Labour needs to remember that its electoral success rested on a two-pronged coalition. There is no doubt it needs the support of middle-class and less radical voters. But it needs to retain its traditional voters too. And it is here that New Labour appears to have been failing. To keep the doubters at bay, Tony Blair will need to demonstrate in the local elections in May that he has begun to win those traditional voters back.</p> <p>John Curtice, a professor at Strathclyde University, is deputy director of the Centre for Research into Elections and Social Trends (Crest)</p>",

But the glory is short-lived. As the credits fall and the theme music plays, all is quiet. Still. Dark. He won the battle but lost the war. One hundred and fifty one points is an admirable tally. They said he'd have been fine earlier on in the series but at this late stage, it wasn't enough to get on to the finals board. So near yet so far. Oh the comedy. Oh the tragedy. Oh the irony. William G Shakespeare himself couldn't have written it.",

Making fun of love: it's not funny and it's not clever. </p> <p>And I think the dogs shone through. In spite of itself, the camera caught something of their gratuitous gaiety, the daft, unquenchable, infectious happiness of dogs. Even if they do lick each other's bottoms.

It is the fourth time that the 84 year-old former dictator has collapsed after suffering a series of small strokes in Britain in September last year. After spending three hours at the military hospital on Monday morning, doctors urged him to undergo a test to measure the flow of blood to his brain at a local private clinic. The Las Condes clinic said he underwent a test called \"cerebral spets\" and was released shortly afterwards. Gen Pinochet's daughter, Jacqueline, revealed that her father was feeling very tired: \"He even fell asleep during the test,\" she said. The incident appeared to be a repeat of the occurence reported by four British doctors, whose findings formed the basis of the decision by the home secretary, Jack Straw, to send him back to Chile, after a 16-month fight against extradition to Spain. The former Chilean dictator first collapsed on September 9 while walking in the garden of his rented home on the Wentworth estate in Surrey. The report said then: \"The clinical diagnosis was of multiple small bilateral cerebral infarcts.\" They said there were two further incidents on September 20 and October 9 and concluded that there would be progressive damage to the blood vessels in his brain. The doctors said that Gen Pinochet, who has a pacemaker and suffers from diabetes, would be physically and mentally unfit for trial. He was suffering from a memory deficit, limited ability to understand complex sentences, impaired ability to express himself audibly, and was easy fatigued, they told Mr Straw. Since his return to Chile on March 3, Gen Pinochet has remained secluded in his heavily guarded suburban Santiago residence. After his latest collapse, state television showed only the former dictator's motorcade speeding into the private clinic. The downturn in his health came after moves for his possible trial gathered pace. The hero's welcome he received from the military has hardened the resolve of the civilian government to see justice done. A judge is currently investigating 72 allegations of Gen Pinochet's involvement in murder, kidnapping and torture, in connection with the 3,197 people who disappeared during his 17-year rule. Yesterday 24 corpses were discovered by government forensic experts in a mass grave in the southern town of Cauquenes. It is the fifth such discovery, and is piling on the pressure for a prosecution. Two weeks ago, the Chilean government announced that the public prosecutor's office would join in criminal proceedings under way against Gen Pinochet. The decision means that government lawyers will be able to take part in investigations against him and would be allowed to intervene in any trial. A petition to strip Gen Pinochet of the immunity from prosecution he enjoys as a senator for life has been approved by the investigating judge and will now be examined by Santiago's appeal court.

Three minutes later, six Mosquitoes, of 464 squadron, attacked the prison buildings through the smoke and debris of the preceding attack.

In July 1939, he was sent to England to complete his training.</p> <p>Smith was posted to 151 squadron flying Hurricane fighters in July 1940, and was soon involved in the Battle of Britain. On August 15, he shot down two Messerschmidt Bf-109E fighters and damaged a third. Other victories followed in August and October. In November, 151 squadron, flying Hurricanes and Defiant fighters, was re-deployed on night operations against the Luftwaffe's night blitz on British cities. Smith was promoted to the rank of flight commander, and in March 1941 was awarded a DFC. In July, flying a Defiant, he destroyed a Dornier Do-217 bomber and damaged a Junkers Ju88 off Cromer.</p> <p>Smith was appointed commanding officer of 151 squadron in February 1942 and acting wing commander in April, when 151 squadron began converting to the potent Mosquito-II night-fighter. On the night of June 24/25, he shot down two German bombers and damaged a third off Yarmouth. He was awarded a bar to his DFC in July, having scored eight aerial kills and four damaged. Having spent more than 2 years flying operationally with 151 squadron, he was rested from operations in March 1943.</p> <p>Later that year, Smith was posted to No 2 (Bomber) Group HQ at the request of its air officer commanding, the famous Air Vice-Marshal Sir Basil Embry. In February 1944, he was appointed commanding officer of 487 squadron, RNZAF, operating Mosquito-VIs. Six Mosquito squadrons, specialising in low-level precision bombing - often against individual buildings - operated with No 2 Group, 2nd Tactical Air Force. Three squadrons - 487, 21 (British), and 464 (Australian) - formed 140 Wing, commanded by the redoubtable Wing Commander \"Pick\" Pickard. Then came Operation Jericho.</p> <p>The following August, Smith led 487 squadron in low-level precision raids on barracks at Poitiers and, some weeks later, on an SS headquarters at Vincey, near Metz. He was subsequently mentioned in dispatches. In October, he was again rested from operations, and served at 13 Officer Training Unit until the end of the war, when he was granted a permanent commission. His later duties included commanding 56 squadron, flying Meteor jets, and staff appointments at HQ Fighter Command and HQ Signals Command.</p> <p>He retired from the RAF as a group captain in 1966, and took up farming in south Devon. His wife Joan, whom he married in 1942 when she was a WAAF officer, died in 1994. They had two daughters, one of whom died in a car accident, and a son, who is now deputy supreme allied commander, Europe, General Sir Rupert Smith.</p> <p>\u0095 Group Captain Irving Stanley 'Black' Smith, pilot, born May 21 1917; died February 16 2000</p>",

The following August, Smith led 487 squadron in low-level precision raids on barracks at Poitiers and, some weeks later, on an SS headquarters at Vincey, near Metz. He was subsequently mentioned in dispatches. In October, he was again rested from operations, and served at 13 Officer Training Unit until the end of the war, when he was granted a permanent commission. His later duties included commanding 56 squadron, flying Meteor jets, and staff appointments at HQ Fighter Command and HQ Signals Command. He retired from the RAF as a group captain in 1966, and took up farming in south Devon. His wife Joan, whom he married in 1942 when she was a WAAF officer, died in 1994. They had two daughters, one of whom died in a car accident, and a son, who is now deputy supreme allied commander, Europe, General Sir Rupert Smith. \u0095 Group Captain Irving Stanley 'Black' Smith, pilot, born May 21 1917; died February 16 2000",

      "byline": "Joan Smith",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Phew! Forget blonde ambition, that Gaultier corset and the notorious knickerless photographs. Think instead maternity smocks, woolly bootees and midnight feeds: Madonna is pregnant for the second time. And aren't we all delighted! This time round, she has found herself a nice Englishman, film director Guy Ritchie, and they are madly in love. The singer, it turns out, is \"a sweet and simple girl\" who is going to be an absolutely wonderful mother.</p> <p>So the raunchy disco diva who shocked the Vatican with the video for her single Like a Prayer is now a much-loved mum-to-be. But can a hunk and a bump really make such a difference? The fact that Madonna's re-invention as a maternal icon is not as innocent as it seems is confirmed by the contrasting treatment handed out yesterday to another famous mum, the tabloids' choice for the discarded \"material girl\" title. The unlucky contender is Posh Spice, Victoria Beckham, who was pictured with her husband in yesterday's Daily Mail under the headline \"Who do they think they are?\" There is no doubt that the Beckhams look increasingly strange. With his new crew cut and a cagoule-type jacket, the footballer looked like a UN volunteer helping a hungry, traumatised refugee and her child to safety in a war zone. In fact, the Beckhams were, as they so often are these days, in the West End of London on a shopping trip.</p> <p>The paper costed out every item the couple wore, from Victoria's Gucci sunglasses (\u00a3130) to Brooklyn's Tommy Hilfiger jacket (\u00a335). Including the couple's jewellery, the total came to \u00a3105,852 - enough, as the Mail did not say, to keep half a dozen Bosnian refugees or Afghan asylum seekers in luxury for months. \"Could they have been more conspicuous?\" the writer demanded. \"Someone needs to take this couple in hand before they destroy themselves, each other, their relationship and their careers.\"</p> <p>But it is Posh, with her new hair colour - blonde ambition, by an awful coincidence of timing - who really gets it in the neck. It is she who is said to be the force behind their endless publicity-seeking, dragging her unfortunate husband along with her as she seeks out yet more photo opportunities. The tabloids' current estimation of the two couples could be summed up, crudely, as Madonna and Guy good, Posh and Becks bad. And when Victoria is bad, it seems, she is very bad indeed.</p> <p>It was not always thus.

      "bodyText": "Phew! Forget blonde ambition, that Gaultier corset and the notorious knickerless photographs. Think instead maternity smocks, woolly bootees and midnight feeds: Madonna is pregnant for the second time. And aren't we all delighted! This time round, she has found herself a nice Englishman, film director Guy Ritchie, and they are madly in love. The singer, it turns out, is \"a sweet and simple girl\" who is going to be an absolutely wonderful mother. So the raunchy disco diva who shocked the Vatican with the video for her single Like a Prayer is now a much-loved mum-to-be. But can a hunk and a bump really make such a difference? The fact that Madonna's re-invention as a maternal icon is not as innocent as it seems is confirmed by the contrasting treatment handed out yesterday to another famous mum, the tabloids' choice for the discarded \"material girl\" title. The unlucky contender is Posh Spice, Victoria Beckham, who was pictured with her husband in yesterday's Daily Mail under the headline \"Who do they think they are?\" There is no doubt that the Beckhams look increasingly strange. With his new crew cut and a cagoule-type jacket, the footballer looked like a UN volunteer helping a hungry, traumatised refugee and her child to safety in a war zone. In fact, the Beckhams were, as they so often are these days, in the West End of London on a shopping trip. The paper costed out every item the couple wore, from Victoria's Gucci sunglasses (\u00a3130) to Brooklyn's Tommy Hilfiger jacket (\u00a335). Including the couple's jewellery, the total came to \u00a3105,852 - enough, as the Mail did not say, to keep half a dozen Bosnian refugees or Afghan asylum seekers in luxury for months. \"Could they have been more conspicuous?\" the writer demanded. \"Someone needs to take this couple in hand before they destroy themselves, each other, their relationship and their careers.\" But it is Posh, with her new hair colour - blonde ambition, by an awful coincidence of timing - who really gets it in the neck. It is she who is said to be the force behind their endless publicity-seeking, dragging her unfortunate husband along with her as she seeks out yet more photo opportunities. The tabloids' current estimation of the two couples could be summed up, crudely, as Madonna and Guy good, Posh and Becks bad. And when Victoria is bad, it seems, she is very bad indeed. It was not always thus. The outpouring of sentimentality which has greeted Madonna's announcement of her pregnancy and the implication that she is really an ordinary girl at heart, are a very recent phenomena. It is not so long since she was portrayed as a sexual predator whose promiscuity had turned her into a lonely recluse, unable to hang on to a boyfriend.

He said Dr Gross had slight brain damage and showed signs of the initial stages of Parkinson's disease. \"He's not confused, he knows where he is and he knows why he's here.\" But because of a reduced attention span and memory lapses, he would have great trouble following the trial for periods of longer than five to 10 minutes.</p> <p>After a short intermission the judge declared Dr Gross unfit to stand trial, saying: \"Dr Gross's mental and physical health has considerably worsened since the last examination.

Dr Gross smiled, stood and shook the hand of his lawyer, Nikolaus Lehner.</p> <p>Outside the court relatives of his alleged victims relayed their shock. \"It's a dirty trick,\" said Adolf Bernard, 62, who spent more than a year in Spiegelgrund. \"He was just playing to the court, which he should be able to do well after all his years of experience as a court doctor.\"</p> <p>Mr Bernard was six when he entered the hospital. He recalled how Dr Gross had been nicknamed \"the scythe\", after the grim reaper. \"He would put me in my bed out on the balcony, naked in the middle of winter in the hope I'd get pneumonia,\" said Mr Bernard.</p> <p>Ms Haupl produced pictures from her handbag of her four-year old sister Annemarie taken by the staff, showing a crying blonde girl with a bloated belly.</p> <p>\"She was starved and poisoned and when she died she weighed less than a one-year-old,\" she said. \"I had hoped that soon I could bury her brain, but goodness knows when that will be possible now.\"</p> <p>Alois Kaufmann, who had been due to give evidence at the trial, said: \"All we want is that somebody finally admits that he did what he did, simply a moral judgment - we don't benefit if he goes to jail or not.\"</p> <p>In 1998 Mr Kaufmann, 66, was given \u00a3385 compensation for the 22 months he spent in Spiegelgrund. He had been admitted to the hospital at the age of 10. Even now he wakes up in the night screaming as a result of a recurring nightmare that he is back in the hospital.</p> <p>\"I've been waiting for 55 years for justice,\" he said. \"I had hoped that the decision to have the trial meant that a new and better generation had emerged in Austria, after years of silence, but now I know it is really true that democracy in Austria is as a layer of tissue paper, behind which Nazi hordes still lurk.\"</p> <p>Werner Vogt, one of Austria's top surgeons, who has campaigned for years for Dr Gross to be tried and in 1981 lost a libel battle against him, called the decision in what is probably the last trial of a Nazi doctor a farce. \"I think Dr Gross is suffering from the Pinochet syndrome,\" he said.</p>",

Outside the court relatives of his alleged victims relayed their shock. \"It's a dirty trick,\" said Adolf Bernard, 62, who spent more than a year in Spiegelgrund. \"He was just playing to the court, which he should be able to do well after all his years of experience as a court doctor.\" Mr Bernard was six when he entered the hospital. He recalled how Dr Gross had been nicknamed \"the scythe\", after the grim reaper. \"He would put me in my bed out on the balcony, naked in the middle of winter in the hope I'd get pneumonia,\" said Mr Bernard. Ms Haupl produced pictures from her handbag of her four-year old sister Annemarie taken by the staff, showing a crying blonde girl with a bloated belly. \"She was starved and poisoned and when she died she weighed less than a one-year-old,\" she said. \"I had hoped that soon I could bury her brain, but goodness knows when that will be possible now.\" Alois Kaufmann, who had been due to give evidence at the trial, said: \"All we want is that somebody finally admits that he did what he did, simply a moral judgment - we don't benefit if he goes to jail or not.\" In 1998 Mr Kaufmann, 66, was given \u00a3385 compensation for the 22 months he spent in Spiegelgrund. He had been admitted to the hospital at the age of 10. Even now he wakes up in the night screaming as a result of a recurring nightmare that he is back in the hospital. \"I've been waiting for 55 years for justice,\" he said. \"I had hoped that the decision to have the trial meant that a new and better generation had emerged in Austria, after years of silence, but now I know it is really true that democracy in Austria is as a layer of tissue paper, behind which Nazi hordes still lurk.\" Werner Vogt, one of Austria's top surgeons, who has campaigned for years for Dr Gross to be tried and in 1981 lost a libel battle against him, called the decision in what is probably the last trial of a Nazi doctor a farce. \"I think Dr Gross is suffering from the Pinochet syndrome,\" he said.",

She called me in a state of real consternation because after a virtual life as a member, she now risked being expelled. She was actually quite terrified of answering the poll. She was living proof that the mayoral issue was deeply dividing the party. And Tony Blair had seemed to be doing so well. My mother was not so much divided as wrenched. Her loyalties to the Labour party, however, also forbade her to ignore it. She told me after much agitated discussion: \"I'm going to hold my nose and dive off the top board. I'm going for Ken, whatever they say or do to me.\" She afterwards had many sleepless nights. I imagine this has happened to many dedicated Labourites. My mother is just one small voice which encapsulates the dilemma. I cannot conceive how the Dobson camp so badly mishandled everything. My mother, for several weeks, now in her dotage, lived in a state of complete turmoil waiting for her expulsion to come through the post. How can they be so very stupid? She has, of course, now been completely vindicated. A vast majority of Londoners of every party have said they will vote for Ken, regardless. And after she has been put through so much stress, so will I.",

      "bodyText": "The old economy, dumped out of the Footsie, may be fighting back in the markets but one way to ensure long-term favour is to embrace dot.com values with a vengeance and talk yourself up as a new world company. Step forward Glynwed International. The 700,000 \"Good Lifers\" who use their Aga and Rayburn cast-iron cookers, collect the kids from prep school in 4x4s and tramp the Chilterns in Barbours and green wellies are to be offered a lifestyle portal. Last year Glynwed abandoned metal-bashing when it sold its foundries to focus on food service equipment and plastic pipes and spent \u00a3250m on acquiring Canada's IPEX pipes business. The impact of this restructuring on last year's results was pre-figured and, sure enough, group pre-tax earnings came in at \u00a371.8m compared with \u00a377.4m a year earlier. But sales in the continuing business rose from \u00a3549m to \u00a3800m, with trading profit up from \u00a353.6m to \u00a386.7m. Tony Wilson, chief executive, is promising pay-back this year, with operating margins up to 12% and the return on capital to 15%. Even the bedraggled engineering analysts were impressed, with Glynwed shares up 8.25p to close at 208.25p. But it's the thought of those AB Aga-owners that excites. The cooker business may account for just 10% of turnover but Glynwed, promising to sell online, has appointed KPMG to seek out media partners for its lifestyle portal: offering fine wines, recipes, exotic hols et al. Even the pipes business, the lion's share of the group's activities, and the food equipment operation are going online. Wait for www.capperplastics.com hardly a debby domain but offering a 24-hour distribution service to customers. Mr Wilson is promising \"tremendous savings\" -but it's the spending patterns of his cooker clients that presage a better future.",

It's one of many contradictions that make you wonder just where Prefab Sprout fit in. Overproduced smoothies or astute sonic designers? Elvis-obsessed Yankophiles or provincial English idealists? Only McAloon could write a critique of Bruce Springsteen's hot rods-and-chicks worldview as sharp as Cars and Girls, then end the track with a line as ambiguous as, \"I guess this world needs its dreamers... May they never wake up.\" Prefab Sprout are also one of the few bands who could be described as both \"bargain-bin\" and \"critically acclaimed\". </p> <p>These days, if you go to enough second-hand record stores, you can get the entire Sprout back catalogue for under a tenner. Last year I bought a new copy of 1989's masterpiece Protest Songs for 10p. How does McAloon feel about that? \"There was a time when I would have been quite upset about it, but you can't really afford to get precious. I'm lucky to be still here getting paid for making music.\" Perhaps this is the low point in the lifecycle of the Sprout catalogue, and in 20 years it will be collectors' stuff? McAloon seems genuinely pleased at the idea. </p> <p>Sixteen years after Prefab released their first album, Swoon, McAloon still seems to care about feedback. Perhaps that's because there's been so little of it recently. The band have released just one album in the past decade, 1997's Andromeda Heights; the inactivity forced Paddy's brother Martin and his ex-girlfriend Wendy Smith to take up teaching (though Martin is still with the band). McAloon himself made ends meet by writing songs for Cher and Jimmy Nail. Yet he claims to have been even more prolific in the 90s than he was in the 80s, and to have stockpiled around 150 songs that he would consider people hearing. So why doesn't he just release them? </p> <p>\"When we signed with a major label (CBS) in the mid-80s, my songs suddenly had a monetary value, which made me think about what I should be writing about if each song is worth something, and made me save songs in case I dried up. I made a rod for my own back: a lot of those songs might be past their sell-by date now because they're about subjects that might seem a little tasteless.\" Two of McAloon's unreleased projects are concept albums about Princess Diana and Michael Jackson. </p> <p>Despite never wanting to be one, he's always been interested in celebrities: Springsteen, Elvis, even God. \"I don't name-drop as much now,\" he says. \"That's a weakness in my earlier style. Those name-drops make the ears prick up, but the effect over a period of time will be different. One day that person's name will have a different kind of resonance for your listener.\" </p> <p>It's interesting that McAloon should be concerned about keeping in tune with the times, when Prefab Sprout have always stood just outside them. After getting their first band together in Newcastle in 1977, McAloon and his brother quickly became disenchanted with punk's year-zero mentality. \"It suddenly seemed like a lot of music critics and musicians had reinvented themselves as people who didn't have a record collection until the summer of 1976. Secretly, I was always listening to Aja by Steely Dan.\" </p> <p>Super-slick but never losing sight of the fact that music should be a tonic for the spirit rather than the ego, Prefab Sprout were the Steely Dan of the 80s. That may explain why they were so desperately uncool in the 90s - and suggests they'll go through some sort of renaissance in the noughties. </p> <p>What's often forgotten about Prefab Sprout is that they were brave enough to introduce highfalutin ideas, convoluted melodies and cunning ironies into the most audience-friendly pop formula. In the track Faron Young, from Steve McQueen, the name of a country firebrand is just a starting point for McAloon's attempts to pre-empt David Bowie's mutation into a roots-rocker. \"I was listening to all this American country music and wondering what people living down the road got out of it. You could say the same thing with rap now: why is it so big in England? It's the strangeness, but it's also real_ It may not be real in your little pocket of the world, but it's glamorous-real, which is what Elvis with echo on his voice must have sounded like to Lennon and McCartney.\" </p> <p>McAloon, 42, has had an uneven few years. He got married - to Victoria, whom he met in a Newcastle music shop - and is now a father. He also had to have a metal buckle fitted behind his right eye to prevent his retina disintegrating. But he's working again, recording random documentaries from the radio, chopping them up, writing them down, then introducing an outside voice to read them over his music. \"I call it fake poetry, because nobody's intended it to mean anything, yet it's organised so it has a certain emotional pull.\" </p> <p>That material isn't likely to feature in Prefab Sprout's forthcoming tour (that's a story in itself - McAloon has made no secret of his dislike of gigging). But McAloon will probably find room for the latest single, Where the Heart Is. That song was actually released in limited numbers three years ago; it seems very like McAloon to be reissuing an old track rather than something new. </p> <p>Where the Heart Is was originally the theme tune for a TV series, and it seems odd that McAloon hasn't done more soundtrack work: his widescreen, picturesque harmonies could do a lot for the cinema. \"I've lost all ambition in that area,\" he says, \"because you're subjugating to someone else's image. I'm thinking in pictures as I'm making it, so I'm pre-empting someone else's job. On the surface of it, it should be great, but if a bloke's singing about Manhattan and making it sound like Manhattan, to have a film of Manhattan to go with it might be overegging the pudding. As John Barry would say, you've got to creep underneath the scene to make a good soundtrack, and I think it's vanity to think that I'm suited to that work.\" He's being ridiculously modest again, of course, but you can see his point: the only screen that McAloon's ever needed is the one behind those spectacles. </p> <p>\u0095 Where The Heart Is is released on May 8.

      "body": "<p>The people's party is full of glint-eyed opportunists on cellular phones. Idealism has been replaced by faith in the global market. Business tycooons are being wooed at the expense of core working-class voters. </p> <p>It sounds like an attack on Blair's Britain by David Hare or Howard Brenton. In fact, it's the key argument of The Great Man, a satire on the Australian Labor Party by David Williamson that is drawing capacity crowds to the Sydney Theatre Company. Thirty years ago Williamson wrote a landmark play, Don's Party, about fading radical hopes after yet another Labor defeat. Now, after long periods of Labor government - the party was in power from 1983 to 1996 - he writes brutally about the compromises of office. </p> <p>Williamson's play is a stark reminder that the left the world over faces the same problems: in particular, the sacrifice of ideology to economic rationalism. It also proves that Australians like their satire red in tooth and claw. </p> <p>Williamson's fictional, recently dead hero was a key minister in the reforming Whitlam government of 1972-75. His widow, Fleur, gathers his old mates together to prepare the funeral orations. What we see is the dismantling of a myth, as the hero's private and political failures are revealed, leading to exposure of financial chicanery. </p> <p>In a sense Williamson subverts his own thesis that the left has lost its political soul - the discovery that the hero created a secret slush fund suggests it never had much of a soul to start with. But Williamson has the gift - which we temporarily seem to have lost - of writing big, popular plays on political subjects. The nearest British equivalent would be Hare and Brenton's Pravda. And Robyn Nevin's production is performed with great gusto, not least by Max Cullen as a pissed painter who declares, \"Our 60s didn't happen till the 70s,\" and by Gary Day as a rogue politician who sees the impending funeral as a heaven-sent photo-opportunity. </p> <p>But the real issue that haunts the national conscience is that of the aborigines - how to make good the injustices of the past. While I was there the prime minister, John Howard, backtracked on a promised gesture of reconciliation. The widespread feeling was that a great opportunity had been missed. </p> <p>Australia, however, has an enviable knack of turning social problems into creative opportunities, and it hit me, like a thunderclap, that it is in the arts that the real racial reconciliation is taking place. I caught the last performance by the vibrant Sydney Theatre Company, which has to raise 80% of its income through box office, of a lively, tuneful, generous-spirited musical called The Sunshine Club. Set in the 40s, it showed an aboriginal soldier returning from wartime service and setting up an interracial dance club in defiance of the curfew laws of the time. When the hero falls for a white girl they inevitably come up against parental intransigence and social hostility. But the real point was how much Australia has moved on - in an ironic present-day coda we see a director of mixed parentage auditioning white actors. Art reflects life: the show itself was written and directed by the brightly talented Wesley Enoch, who has an aboriginal father and a mother of Spanish- Danish descent, and who told me he looks forward to the not-too-distant day when 60% of Australians will be of mixed blood. </p> <p>Assimilation, of course, brings its problems; this is the theme of an outstanding solo show, White Baptist Abba Fan, which Britons will have a chance to see when it comes to the Barbican in July as part of a festival celebrating Australia's centenary of federation. Written and performed by Deborah Cheetham, it has a devastating autobiographical truth. Taken from her mother as a baby by a Salvation Army officer, Cheetham was brought up as an \"adopted aboriginal\" by a white middle-class family, studied music at Sydney Conservatorium and is now a fast- rising opera singer. Professional gain, however, is accompanied by emotional loss. Meeting her real family, she is first seen by them as \"a self-opinionated lesbian snob\" and only gradually comes to terms with her racial identity. The hauntingly poignant story is leavened by Cheetham's graceful rendering of arias by Handel, Puccini and Gounod; whether she remains an Abba fan I'm not quite sure. </p> <p>Another work on the forcible removal of aboriginal children from their parents, Jane Harrison's Stolen, directed by Wesley Enoch, comes to London's Tricycle theatre in July. But it would be wrong to suggest the per vasive note is one of guilt or recrimination. Sheer creative joy was the theme of an exhibition of modern aboriginal art, Beyond the Pale, that I saw at the Adelaide festival. This is a show that would cause a sensation in London or New York. </p> <p>At the same venue, the Art Gallery of South Australia, I also caught a remarkable performance, Ochre and Dust, by two elderly aboriginal storytellers. Seated on top of a huge sandstone mound, the women kept us enthralled for 80 minutes with their stories of their battles with former PM Malcolm Fraser over the rights to Ayers Rock. They described the concern they shared with urban whites over dissolute grandchildren: \"Down here,\" they claimed, \"they're sniffing glue; up there they're sniffing petrol.\" At the same time, they lamented the harsh mandatory sentencing meted out to aboriginal delinquents. Out of the texture of their lives they created a piece of narrative theatre that Peter Brook might have envied. </p> <p> Isaw the show with the American director Peter Sellars, who's in charge of the 2002 Adelaide festival. He was also impressed by Australia's multiculturalism and huge artistic potential. The difference is that he can do something about it. Building on the achievements of the previous director, Robyn Archer, he plans an all- Australian event for 2002. There will be no foreign imports. \"Instead of shows coming to Adelaide,\" he said, \"I want Adelaide to send its events out into the world. I believe Australia can assume a leadership role in the arts in the new century.\" His aim is to explore through the festival the triple themes of ecology, truth and reconciliation, and rights as a measure of peoples. And his boldest plan is to commission six new Australian films, which will be the centrepiece of the festival. He hopes they will interest Channel 4, too. It's a measure of Australia's new-found artistic confidence that his visionary plan seems entirely feasible: the days of the \"cultural cringe\" are gone. </p> <p>In New Zealand, too, biculturalism is the keyword. It's no accident that the stunning national museum in Wellington is known by the Maori name of Te Papa. At Wellington's New Zealand Festival 2000, I could have caught a number of travelling events, including - so help me - the Edinburgh festival Tattoo on its first-ever visit outside Scotland. But what really grabbed me was a batch, of six original New Zealand plays of which I managed to see four. As in Australia I found the present was being defined through an exploration of the country's past. </p> <p>I was very struck by Stuart Hoar's Rutherford, which, like Michael Frayn's Copenhagen, examined the moral responsibility of the nuclear physicist. I was also impressed by a cabaret show called Blue Smoke, which re-created the tacky, drag-queen glamour of a New Zealand night club in 1959 with acrid nostalgia. But it was a Maori play, Haruru Mai by Briar Grace-Smith, that most intrigued me - and not only because it co-starred the stunning Rena Owen, best known in the UK for her performance in the movie Once Were Warriors. The play dealt with a veteran of the second world war Maori Battalion who in peacetime becomes a victim of social obloquy when he starts an affair with a young girl. At one point the hero defends the need to fight fascism, and the heroism of Maori soldiers. \"They were forgotten,\" Rena Owen tartly replies, \"the moment they stepped off the boat.\" Tragic in outline, the play finally ends in reconciliation. </p> <p>Three weeks in Australasia is a short time in which to reach conclusions. But I was constantly struck, in both Australia and New Zealand, by the vast gap between image and reality. The moral is, never judge a country by its soaps or by the excesses of its pop culture. Even more, I was enviously amazed by the way the arts are part of a healing process. Can we in raddled old Europe, who so like to patronise the southern hemisphere, honestly say as much?</p>",

At one point the hero defends the need to fight fascism, and the heroism of Maori soldiers. \"They were forgotten,\" Rena Owen tartly replies, \"the moment they stepped off the boat.\" Tragic in outline, the play finally ends in reconciliation. Three weeks in Australasia is a short time in which to reach conclusions. But I was constantly struck, in both Australia and New Zealand, by the vast gap between image and reality. The moral is, never judge a country by its soaps or by the excesses of its pop culture. Even more, I was enviously amazed by the way the arts are part of a healing process. Can we in raddled old Europe, who so like to patronise the southern hemisphere, honestly say as much?",

The men and women representing some of the country's biggest employers - for local government employs 2.1m in England and Wales alone - know that if services fall below set standards, the government will step in.

With 24,000 Notts employees under his wing, the county council, serving 700,000 people, has been preparing for best value for some time. It even has a best value board to monitor standards, which includes people from outside county hall including a banker and a former director of Boots. </p> <p>Like other councils, Notts has set in train an elaborate system of public consultation to underpin best value, with a 1,000-strong \"people's panel\" - which is regularly consulted - and another panel of 500 key stakeholders in the county. </p> <p>Like other senior town and county hall officials, Terry Gorman says it's the biggest challenge he's faced in 30 years in local government. While not decrying the new regime - \"most of it makes sense\" - he has a few fears that the inspection and auditing process which every council will soon face could prove overbearing and inflexible, with authorities serving the regime more than the public. \"If we spend our time just ticking boxes, it will be self-defeating and it could be that we lose touch with what we are about - serving the people.\" </p> <p>Perhaps with an eye on the Ofsted regime in education, he fears that councils could become creatures of accountancy, driven by the bottom line. While market testing services is a key to the new system, he cautions that councils can never compete with the private sector on a straight cost basis. \"Services should not be undertaken according to a cost-driven, bottom-line basis\". </p> <p>The other fear is that, in spite of protestations to the contrary, best value could prove as tiresome as the compulsory competitive tendering regime it replaces. CCT, first introduced in 1980 by a Thatcher government instinctively hostile to councils, initially covered contracting services and was extended to manual services, such as refuse collection, and school meals, in 1988 and to white collar services in 1991. Intriguingly, the senior DETR civil servant responsible for CCT is also in charge of best value. </p> <p>However, Matthew Warburton, head of strategy at the Local Government Association, cautions that the big difference with best value is the philosophy of continuous improvement. \"The idea is that authorities will be judged by their ability to do things better and not by their ability to jump through a series of hoops.\" </p> <p>Nevertheless, there are those who fear that with so many performance indicators, which will have to be met (in DETR-speak) by councils annually reviewing \"why they are providing services and who is best placed to deliver them\", there's a danger of best value becoming, in effect, \"son of CCT\". Results of the continuous review process will have to be published and distributed widely so as to give electors a chance to respond. </p> <p>As the local government minister, Hilary Armstrong, explained at the launch of the performance indicators: \"Responsive, customer-focused services, delivered to high standards, are at the heart of the modern society we wish to create. We need imaginative councils prepared to challenge the status quo if we are to achieve these goals. We also need to create a climate in which councils involve local people in decisions about service levels and delivery, and inform them about progress to date.\" </p> <p>And if they don't? As the bulky performance indicator booklet, prepared by the DETR and the audit commission explains, the government \"will have powers to intervene in cases of serious failure\" of local services.

But their marking was slack at the resulting corner, Craig Hignett helped on Barnard's ball at the near post and, from the same spot where he had been thwarted seconds earlier, Shipperley slid in his 10th goal of the season: there is an art in standing still. Barnard was fortunate to be only booked for a wild challenge on Goldbaek which caused the Fulham defender to be replaced by Wayne Collins at the interval. Collins almost turned in a Fulham equaliser at the near post after Hayles had torn past Barker on the right and then Hayles, whose pace offered Fulham their likeliest outlet, suffered for loose control as he failed to prey upon Miller's poor clearance. With Hignett, so often Barnsley's inspiration, relatively subdued, the Tykes hardly mustered a threat. If they do go up, they will do so less well equipped than they were two years ago and, barring miracles, can anticipate immediate relegation with another hefty Sky TV payment to help them on their way. \u0095Goals from Steve Claridge, a penalty, and Shaun Derry gave Portsmouth the points against West Bromwich, who had Matt Carbon sent off after he received two yellow cards.",

      "bodyText": "Gordon Brown claimed to have eradicated boom-bust by forecasting a robust outlook for economic growth accompanied by low inflation and sound public finances. Confirming widespread expectations in the City, he jacked up the growth prediction for this year to a range of 2.75%-3.25%, well above the 2.5% rate the Treasury regards as sustainable in the long run without putting upward pressure on inflation. This compared to November's pre-Budget report forecast of 2.5%-3%. The boost mainly reflects higher than expected consumer spending levels but is also due to upward revisions to investment and government spending. However, the strength of sterling is seen as taking its toll, with exports detracting from rather than adding to overall gross domestic product growth in 2000. The headroom for above-trend growth this year is created by inflation being below the government's 2.5% target for the last 11 months. But with precious little spare capacity in the economy the Treasury reckons the economy needs to slow down soon to keep the rate of price increases in check. It has pencilled in output growth of between 2.25% and 2.75% during both of the next two years. The Treasury attributes the slowdown in growth to the pre-emptive 1% point increase in interest rates seen since last September. \"Within a credible policy framework such moves are likely to have a significant impact, and a marked slowing in household spending growth is expected from the second half of 2000,\" it says. Along with the International Monetary Fund and other independent forecasters, the Treasury says the main risk to its forecast is that growth will prove too strong, leading to overheating in the economy. \"In particular, there is a strong risk of more rapid growth in domestic demand, at least in the near term,\" the Treasury says. In particular, the Treasury flags up its concern about the danger of another house price boom leading to runaway consumer spending. While expecting house price inflation and transactions to ease later this year and during the period to 2001 - partly due to higher interest rates - the Treasury nevertheless says that past housing cycles have tended to overshoot. \"While the new macroeconomic framework provides a more credible guard against speculative behaviour, policy will need to remain alert to the risks,\" says the Treasury. However, the risks are not all seen as being in one direction. The threat of an uncontrolled consumer boom is balanced to some extent by the danger of a global stock market crash and a sharper than expected slowing in American and world growth. \"This would have direct implications for UK stock prices, export demand and sterling. Moreover, it would pose the risk of a sudden deterioration in private sector balance sheets, prompting a much sharper deceleration in domestic spending.\" The strong pound is also seen as posing a downside risk to growth, via a flood of cheap imports and waning exports. However, the treasury flatly rejects suggestions that the Bank of England should attempt to target both inflation and the exchange rate to help ailing manufacturing industry. Such a course of action would \"lead back to the policies that caused economic instability in the past\". The damaging impact of the currency's overvaluation is seen in the current account projections - which show a deficit of some \u00a320.5bn in 2000, rising to \u00a321bn in 2001 before beginning to fall to \u00a319.75 during 2002. In the pre-Budget report, the equivalent figures were \u00a310.25bn, \u00a311.5bn and \u00a310.75bn. Despite net tax cuts of around \u00a31.2bn and increases in public spending worth some \u00a34bn, the public finances are predicted to be healthier than in last year's Budget. This reflects both unexpectedly strong growth, which has boosted tax receipts and reduced social security spending, reduced debt servicing costs due to cheaper long term borrowing, and structural factors, which mean that the tax take per unit of gross domestic product is higher than the Treasury believed. For example, the introduction of self-assessment has yielded far more income than expected over and beyond the impact of the economic cycle. According to the Treasury, the public finances comfortably meet both the chancellor's tough rules for borrowing and debt - that he should only borrow to invest and keep debt as a proportion of gross domestic product below 40%. The current budget is projected to be in surplus by a massive \u00a317bn in the year 1999-2000, \u00a314bn next year, \u00a316bn in 2001-02 and \u00a313bn in 2002-2003. The debt to output ratio, meanwhile, falls from 37.1% in 1999-2000 to 35.1% next year, 33.6% in 2001-2002 and 32.7% in 2002-2003. Treasury sources stressed the fiscal stance was continuing to support monetary policy by not overstimulating the economy at a time when there is already upward pressure on inflation. If there had been no Budget this year the fiscal stance would have tightened by around 1.6% of output because of the money sucked out of the economy by the higher than expected tax take and unplanned reductions in spending on unemployment and debt interest. The net tax cuts announced yesterday and the increases in spending on crucial areas merely offset part of that fiscal tightening, not all of it. Overall, therefore, the fiscal stance is still tighter than anticipated in last year's Budget by 1.1% of output, falling to 0.6% of output in 2001-2002. Although the current budget is projected to remain in surplus, net borrowing - which includes investment spending such as new hospitals and schools - is predicted to rise towards the end of the forecast horizon, reaching \u00a311bn in the year 2003-2004. Despite believing the the economy's long-term growth rate has risen to 2.5%, the Treasury is continuing to forecast public finances on the cautious assumption that it remains at 2.25%.",

      "bodyText": "1960 Born in Wigan on New Year's Day. 1977 Joins Bury on a free transfer from Wigan. 1980 Moves to Chesterfield for \u00a3100,000. 1983 Brian Clough pays \u00a350,000 to take Wilson to Nottingham Forest. Makes only 10 appearances for Forest and is loaned to Scunthorpe. Eventually leaves the City Ground for Brighton. 1987 Joins Luton for \u00a3150,000. 1988 Collects League Cup winners' medal as Luton beat Arsenal 3-2 at Wembley. 1989 Luton beaten 3-1 by Nottingham Forest in League Cup final. 1990 Moves to Sheffield Wednesday for \u00a3200,000 and makes 137 appearances in all competitions for the Owls. 1993 Costs Barnsley \u00a3200,000 in July. 1995 Leads the Tykes to sixth position in the First Division in his first full season as player-manager at Oakwell. Sheffield Wednesday's first approach for their former player fails in May when Wilson signs a new contract at Barnsley. The Owls were seeking a successor to Trevor Francis. 1997 Takes Barnsley into the top flight for the first time in the club's 110-year history. They finish as runners-up in the First Division to Bolton. 1998 Barnsley reach quarter-finals of the FA Cup after beating Manchester United 3-2 in a thrilling replay at Oakwell. But they are knocked out of the last eight by Newcastle and despite a brave struggle, are relegated. After four years of managing Barnsley, Wilson accepts offer to replace Ron Atkinson as Sheffield Wednesday boss and leads Owls to 12th place finish in 1998-99 Premiership season, 11 points clear of the relegation zone. 1999 September 19: beaten 8-0 by Newcastle United, with Alan Shearer scoring five goals. Dave Richards defiantly stands by his beleaguered manager, saying he would not be sacked. October 2: Wednesday finally bring an end to the worst league start in their history - almost trebling their goals tally for the season in the process with a 5-1 home win over Wimbledon. 2000 January: A group of four Sheffield MPs hold a meeting with investment company Charterhouse, who hold a 36% stake in the club, during which it emerges the politicians want Wilson sacked because of Wednesday's woeful form. Wilson rides the storm which leads to the MPs turning on then chairman Dave Richards, but he, too, fends off the criticism. February: Richards stands down after nine years in charge at Hillsborough, due to his impending appointment as chairman of the FA Premier League, although he retains his place on the board. Solicitor Howard Culley steps up from director to chairman, although does not give Wilson the same strong backing he received from Richards. March 21: 72 hours after Wednesday lose 1-0 in a crunch relegation clash with bottom side Watford, Wilson is sacked, 21 months into a four-year contract.",

      "bodyText": "The person who works at this desk is fast-moving and extrovert. Technology is consigned to the upper shelf to make space for creative work; the keyboard indicates that the work involves music. The boxes on the right are stacked in a precarious arrangement which suggests originality, a sense of daring and mischief. The flowers and photograph reveal a sentimental, affectionate person, their yellow and dark pink colours suggesting that this affection can be physical, even slightly aggressive, though her head will usually rule her heart. The yellow reveals an idealistic, imaginative person who is young-at-heart (the space invader gun and the cartoon-bird mousemat). It also reveals a person who has high expectations, and who is able to think clearly. She may not have time to organise things (the trays full of paperwork mixed with photographs) and is slightly scatty. The pen crossed over the notepad suggests a person who works fast - she'd rather be somewhere else. This is an original thinker with a real zest for life and a great sense of humour; however, the humour is always balanced by hard work. Is this the desk of Victoria Wood? Did our expert get it right? Nina Wadia responds: \"It's spot on - especially her comments about the way the boxes are stacked because I do like balancing things. I'm a Sagittarian and it reminds me of reading astrologer Linda Goodman's stuff.\" \u0095 Nina Wadia stars in Perfect World on BBC2 on Friday BBC2 at 9.30pm.",

It's a writing-on-the-wall piece, forcing home the quiet realisation that with the Freedom party now embroiled in Austria's government, the metaphorical inscription is back in place. </p> <p>Stylistically it's at a tangent from the rest of Zemlinsky's output. He abandons his usual post-Romantic succulence for something both uncompromising and retrospective. The overlapping choral writing peers back through Brahms (who abandoned Hamburg for cosmopolitan Vienna in 1863) to Haydn.

Its final section is less a blaze of glory than a shriek of rage. It was counterposed with another of his Psalm settings, No 23, written in 1910, when Zemlinsky was basking in Vienna's Jugendstil glory days. It draws heavily on Mahler (Zemlinsky's great hero) and is in some respects an optimistic rerun of Das Lied von der Erde, using a comparable musical language to depict the \"green pastures\" and \"still waters\" in which both the psalmist and Zemlinsky find contentment. The Czech conductor Jiri Belohlavek approaches both works with glowing commitment, proud, perhaps, of Zemlinsky's association with Prague, where he lived in the 20s. </p> <p>The golden age of Austrian humaneness was represented in the concert by Mozart and Haydn. Alfred Brendel was the soloist in Mozart's D Minor Piano Concerto, No 20. The work has often been described as a trial run for Don Giovanni - and Brendel's playing seemed to seduce the turbulent orchestra into lustrous quiescence. Belohlavek, meanwhile, is outstanding in Haydn, whose 96th Symphony ebbed and flowed with tender warmth. </p>",
