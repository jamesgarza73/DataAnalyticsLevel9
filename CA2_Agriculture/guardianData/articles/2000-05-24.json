The expansiveness of his mindset is showcased best on the third song aired here, New World Water, which scratches at the sour underbelly of social policy by outlining our need and exploitation of water: an uncharacteristic hip hop subject. </p> <p>It's this combination of probing thought and battle ready flow that first caught the attention of his former mentors, A Tribe Called Quest. Unlike ATCQ frontman Q-Tip, who has slowly lost the plot, Mos Def knows that staying true to the best in yourself means talking in dark, visionary tongues. After all, there isn't room in his systematic principles for a rented approach. </p> <p>This was no ordinary hip hop show: Mos Def took the unprecedented step of dispensing with a DJ and employing a distinguished live band. The band, which included On-U-Sound stalwart Doug Wimbush on bass, had the good sense to understate rather than compete. Tending to begin with a couple of rhythmic or melodic fragments and expand outwards, the four-piece tapped New York's passion for electro funk. After a stint with jazz beats, the band cranked up the P-Funk meter, keeping the melodies minimal and the drums hard and snapping. </p> <p>As Mos Def grew more focused, he became less faithful to one style. A slippery chameleon, he seemed equally at home singing the heartfelt ballad Love, rocking out to a full metal racket or leading a traditional call-and-response routine. At this musical crossroads, Mos Def has created several types of music at once, with acoustic beats as stark as x-rays. That you couldn't always hear him was a testament to the crowd's raucous participation, even though only a few songs qualified as sing-along anthems: the clear-eyed prose poems on his solo debut, Black on Both Sides are far too abstract and radical for that. </p> <p>Before slipping into a perfect rendition of Sly and the Family Stone's Stand, Mos Def pushed his versatility to its limits with his forthcoming single, Umi Says. \"Umi says, shine a light on the world, let my people be free,\" he sang, pitching his smooth vocals over humungous, low resolution beats. It may be a cliche, but in the mouth of Mos Def it felt vital, a sign that hip hop's future is bright.</p>",

A slippery chameleon, he seemed equally at home singing the heartfelt ballad Love, rocking out to a full metal racket or leading a traditional call-and-response routine. At this musical crossroads, Mos Def has created several types of music at once, with acoustic beats as stark as x-rays. That you couldn't always hear him was a testament to the crowd's raucous participation, even though only a few songs qualified as sing-along anthems: the clear-eyed prose poems on his solo debut, Black on Both Sides are far too abstract and radical for that. Before slipping into a perfect rendition of Sly and the Family Stone's Stand, Mos Def pushed his versatility to its limits with his forthcoming single, Umi Says. \"Umi says, shine a light on the world, let my people be free,\" he sang, pitching his smooth vocals over humungous, low resolution beats. It may be a cliche, but in the mouth of Mos Def it felt vital, a sign that hip hop's future is bright.",

      "byline": "Tim Ashley",

      "body": "<p> Founded in 1947 and conducted throughout its history by such luminaries as Otto Klemperer, Fritz Busch and Herbert von Karajan, the Cologne WDR Symphony - effectively the West German Radio orchestra - isn't as well known to UK audiences as some of its counterparts. This formidable concert, under its current music director Semyon Bychkov, will hopefully have strengthened its reputation. It proved an impressive ensemble with a luscious string sound and vibrant, slightly edgy brass; its chief glory was its woodwind, finely honed and by turns sensual and pointillistic. The relationship with Bychkov is, one suspects, something special: the evening found him on much better form than I've heard him for some time. </p> <p>The programme paired Mendelssohn with Strauss. The flamboyant Labecque sisters, Katia and Marielle, were the soloists in Mendelssohn's E Major Concerto for Two Pianos, written for him and his sister Fanny when he was only 14. In some respects it shows its juvenility, gathering together the influences that eventually formed the mature composer.

      "bodyText": "Founded in 1947 and conducted throughout its history by such luminaries as Otto Klemperer, Fritz Busch and Herbert von Karajan, the Cologne WDR Symphony - effectively the West German Radio orchestra - isn't as well known to UK audiences as some of its counterparts. This formidable concert, under its current music director Semyon Bychkov, will hopefully have strengthened its reputation. It proved an impressive ensemble with a luscious string sound and vibrant, slightly edgy brass; its chief glory was its woodwind, finely honed and by turns sensual and pointillistic. The relationship with Bychkov is, one suspects, something special: the evening found him on much better form than I've heard him for some time. The programme paired Mendelssohn with Strauss. The flamboyant Labecque sisters, Katia and Marielle, were the soloists in Mendelssohn's E Major Concerto for Two Pianos, written for him and his sister Fanny when he was only 14. In some respects it shows its juvenility, gathering together the influences that eventually formed the mature composer. Allusions to Bach, late Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven are welded into a whole that has the melodic ingenuity and textural buoyancy of the overture to A Midsummer Night's Dream, with which it is roughly contemporaneous. The nocturnal slow movement is a bit of a cheat: since the soloists rarely play together, it technically could be done with one pianist.

His nagging line and length, plus his ability to get the occasional delivery to move away quite sharply, always posed problems and has so far earned him figures of three for 30 from nine overs. On a couple of other occasions Kirtley beat the bat without reward as Essex were left questioning their decision to bat first. Not that Adams was complaining.",

The ball finally ends up at the feet of Mendieta on the edge of the box, but his usually trusty right foot lets him down and the ball squirms into the arms of Iker Casillas.<br> <strong>21</strong> A better spell for Valencia. Gerard has a header palmed away by Casillas, and the ball is immediately worked back into the Real area by Farinos, and Casillas has to be quick again to prevent the marauding Lopez from reaching the ball.<br> <strong>25</strong> The game is now largely being contested in midfield.

Still no clear-cut chance, but if the game continues to be played at the pace it is currently, one will surely arrive.<br> <strong>29</strong> Lo and behold, the first chance arrives, and it falls to Steve McManaman. A hopeful cross from Redondo on the left falls to the Scouser who clips it with his right foot. The ball is edging inside the far post, but a sprawling Canizares manages to claw the ball away. The resulting corner ends up with McManaman again, and he duly loses the ball.<br> <strong>34</strong> Jocelyn Angloma, perhaps the world's nippiest 35-year-old full-back, attempts to take on the entire Real back line.

Valencia may be the natural counter-attacking side, but now they must take the game to Real leaving the likes of Anelka and Raul a lot more space. Anelka on this occasion opts to take full-back Gerardo on for pace, succeeds and cracks in a shot from a tight angle that forces a save from Canizares.<br> <strong>52</strong> Valencia have a lucky escape when Miroslav Djukic is uncharacteristically uncertain inside his own box. Anelka swiftly puts the Yugoslav under pressure, and then Morientes robs him, only for Djukic to poke the ball off Morientes' toes at the last minute.<br> <strong>56</strong> After criticising him for losing possession in the first-half, it is only fair to point out that Steve McManaman is performing a sterling defensive job for Madrid. Always willing to cover for (the often advancing) Roberto Carlos, McManaman has also made several important challenges, and toe pokes, in the opening stages of this half.<br> <strong>58</strong> To emphasise the point, McManaman makes a vital sliding challenge on Mendieta inside the box. The tackle is so obviously clean that Valencia players don't even bother to claim a penalty. <br> <strong>67 MACCA GOAL! Real 2 - 0 Valencia</strong> Flipping heck. England's prospective left-winger hits a right-footed volley from the 18-yard line that sneaks inside Canizares' left-hand post. His team-mates go wild, but cool hand Macca just runs back to the centre spot.<br> <strong>71</strong> Valencia substitution: Ilie for Angulo. <strong>72</strong> Valencia's best chance of the game. A long pass from Gerard is flicked on by Mendieta, and finds Claudio Lopez free in the area. The Argentinian tries to flick it around Casillas but scuffs it instead and holds his head in his hands.<br> <strong>74</strong> Real substitution: Savio for Morientes.<br> <strong>75 GOAL! Real 3 - 0 Valencia</strong> Raul puts the game beyond doubt. Catching the Valencia defence up the field once more, he sprints the length of the field, shimmies past Canizares, tucks the ball beyond Pellegrino and inside the far post.<br> <strong>78</strong> Real substitution: Sanchis for Anelka.<br> <strong>83</strong> McManaman begins to enjoy himself, teasing Kily and Farinos on the touchline. He even manages to dodge Farinos' lunging challenge and get a free-kick in the process.<br> <strong>84</strong> Real substitution: Hierro for Salgado.<br> <strong>90</strong> Savio is brought down 20 yards out from the Valencia goal. Roberto Carlos has damaged his groin, so Hierro strikes the free-kick and curls it over. <br> <strong>92</strong> Full-time. Real Madrid are European Champions for a record eighth time.</p>",

Catching the Valencia defence up the field once more, he sprints the length of the field, shimmies past Canizares, tucks the ball beyond Pellegrino and inside the far post. 78 Real substitution: Sanchis for Anelka. 83 McManaman begins to enjoy himself, teasing Kily and Farinos on the touchline. He even manages to dodge Farinos' lunging challenge and get a free-kick in the process. 84 Real substitution: Hierro for Salgado. 90 Savio is brought down 20 yards out from the Valencia goal. Roberto Carlos has damaged his groin, so Hierro strikes the free-kick and curls it over. 92 Full-time. Real Madrid are European Champions for a record eighth time.",

Members of the Belgian parliament's interior affairs committee were shown around the Stade du Pays and said they were concerned at the steep banks of seating that could put spectators at risk, and that violence between opposing fans could mar the Group A match on June 17. Paul Tant, the committee's chairman, said the tour \"could not relieve the sense of worry on the part of some colleagues\". Pieter de Crem, a committee member, added: \"We fear the worst. Everybody always says they are prepared but the security risk is especially big. One has the feeling of being in an extremely dangerous position and that is an especially big risk.\" Politicians are particularly concerned over the steep seating in the 30,000-capacity stadium which could pose problems in an emergency. During recent tests at the stadium, mountain rescue techniques had to be used to evacuate people. The stands have been built steeply because the stadium is hemmed in by other buildings and extra seats have been installed to meet the minimum 30,000 capacity. Concerns have also been voiced that thousands of ticketless English and German supporters could attend the match given Belgium's proximity to both countries. The Belgian Federal Police Union has voiced concerns over the stadium, claiming that upgrading work and the erection of steep stands did not take into account the safety of fans. But Euro 2000 and Uefa officials have defended the Charleroi stadium and rejected calls to move the England against Germany match to a bigger venue, such as Brussels or Rotterdam. The Stade du Pays will also host England against Romania on June 20 and Yugoslavia against Slovenia on June 13. With just over three weeks to go to the England-Germany match, Belgian police are finalising the security operation. About 2,000 officers are expected to be on duty for the match and special mobile courts will be brought into Charleroi to deal with any troublemakers. Local officials have still not decided whether bars in the town will remain open on the day of the match, although British politicians have asked for them to be closed as part of an alcohol ban. Officially England and Germany have an allocation of about 5,000 tickets each but many more tickets are available on the black market with touts in England asking \u00a3500 a ticket. Tournament organisers have said that anyone with a ticket which does not have their name on it will be refused entry to grounds and fans will also have to carry some form of identification throughout Euro 2000, which begins on June 10.",

A straggle of drinkers out on the terrace of the National Theatre stop their conversations, produce miniature radios from their pockets, and, gazing at the screen, fit the earphones. On the bridge below, a small group is gathering, gazing upwards, their silhouettes casting long shadows down on to the South Bank's promenade. </p> <p>Capturing the audiences' attention is a head and shoulders shot of a young girl that takes up most of the huge screen that dominates one side of the National Theatre. She is staring straight at the camera. The background is blurred, the girl's inscrutable gaze gives the composition the look of a huge school photo. As you gaze at the screen, it becomes gradually apparent that this is not a static shot - the ends of the girl's long brown hair is moving, impossibly slowly, blown by a slow-motion wind. She closes her eyes langorously and reopens them, with the hint of a shy smile. After a minute or so, the scene changes to a wide-angle shot of a caravan park. Over the earphones comes a series of flat London accents reciting names, of people, of rivers, seemingly at random. It is oddly compelling as you listen for patterns and rhythms, and play the game yourself as you try and think up rivers that the mystery speakers didn't mention.</p> <p>The brown-haired girl is one of 40 such portraits that make up the first half of Time After, Time Along, The River, a film by Swiss artist Marie Jose Burki. It is the inaugural event of the Thames and Hudson Rivers project - a two-year-long series of events being held on the banks of the two great rivers of two of the world's greatest cities - London and New York. It is surely one of the most unusual cinematic events Londoners are likely to encounter this year. </p> <p>Not only is Burki's film being shown outside rather than inside a cinema, but you need to tune to the correct frequency to hear the soundtrack and get the full effect. A special FM channel has been installed to transmit the voiceover soundtrack, and 1,000 custom-designed portable radios are available to buy on the South Bank. By tuning into 87.9FM, people within a two-mile radius of the South Bank can pick up this extraordinary film's soundtrack. You have to be a bit nearer to see it, much not much.</p> <p>Time After, Time Along, The River - the London version - follows the Thames and people who live, work and play along its banks, from Canby Island in the east, westwards to Richmond. Burki achieved her slow motion effect by filming each portrait for three or four seconds with a special camera that takes thousands of frames a minute, and then slowing down and stretching the footage so that the three seconds become a minute and a half. The effect is eerie and mesmerising.</p> <p>The soundtrack behind the images features the voices of Thames people reciting names of friends and colleagues, and names of rivers - whatever and whoever they can remember. Says Burki: \"I didn't want to capture their intimacy, I didn't want to make a documentary - that's not my thing. So I just asked them to give me the names of people who they worked with, or hung around with or went to school with... and then to tell me the names of rivers they know which might bring them further away.</p> <p>\"I began to become interested in people's voices,\" explained Burki, \"their thick accents, their timbre, the way they spread out. The way they express themselves.\" </p> <p>Born in Switzerland, Burki lives and works in Brussels and is a world-renowned video artist. Her work features in a number of permanent collections in Europe and America, and she has won a number of awards in her native country. </p> <p>Although the \u00a39 price tag for the customised radios might seem a little steep, they can be reused, and on Friday nights throughout May a selection of films selected by Burki will be shown on the screen (known as the Fourth Wall). Both Disney classics and Hollywood westerns are rumoured to be among the super-screen's forthcoming attractions. </p> <p>The second part of Burki's film will be shown in New York next September - with scenes from the Hudson intercut with New York monologues. </p> <p>Time After, Time Along, The River is shown every night - bar Sunday - at the National Theatre's Lyttleton Flyover (the Lyttleton terrace) at 9.30pm.

It is better if the front line is provided by African troops facing African situations.\" West African countries have discussed sending in troops, mostly Nigerians, who have already had experience in Sierra Leone. Mr Cook said Europe could provide logistical support and leadership for an African force, adding that any UN peacekeeping force must have a \"robust mandate\" and be able to use force to protect itself and civilians under its protection. The day after Britain committed itself to arming and training the beleaguered Sierra Leone army, Mr Cook said Europe could provide logistical backup and leadership to an African force. He said any UN peacekeeping force must have a \"robust mandate\" and be able to use force to protect itself and civilians under its protection. \"We do not envisage any circumstances in which our fighting units will become a combat force within the UN,\" Mr Cook said. Britain had received thanks from Sierra Leone President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah for its \"extremely valuable\" role in stabilising the West African country, Mr Cook added. Mr Kabbah's troops have made significant gains against Revolutionary United Front rebels since British paratroopers flew in to the former British colony earlier this month. Last week, paratroopers experienced their first fight against anti-government forces, killing at least three people. Defence sources said it appeared that the rebel RUF forces had split into two factions and said UN and Sierra Leone forces were pushing out of Freetown along main supply routes, with the rebels pulling back.",

As Thomas Jefferson might have said, a slander on Oxford is half-way round the world before truth has got her boots on. </p> <p>Laura Spence thought she had been turned down because she hadn't come across well in an interview. I've no idea if that is true, but I am, unusually in Oxford, utterly opposed to basing admissions decisions on interviews. Unless interviewers are carefully trained, they are suckers for charm and liveliness. The process gives the students impolitely described by one researcher as \"middle-class bullshitters\" a flying start. And when a tongue-tied student comes to life in an interview, it's likely to be sheer luck that the interviewer has hit on a question that has finally sparked the student's interest. Tutors like interviews because they can see whom they're going to teach next year, but interviews are a much worse way of detecting ability than written evidence. Yet Oxford and Cambridge (not to mention London School of Economics, Imperial College, and University College London) have problems with using A levels and GCSE results alone. Laura Spence's headteacher made a great to-do about her having 10 A and A* grades in GCSE; but every candidate for admission has 10 or more A and A* grades in GCSE and almost all of them will go on to get a minimum of three A grades at A level. You need some way of picking the one applicant you can take from among the three or four who look equally well qualified on paper. </p> <p>Oxford got rid of entrance examinations because it was thought that it would make life easier for applicants from state schools; and now it seems that interviews are the trouble. Short of offering places by lottery to anyone who shows up with 10 A or A* grades at GCSE, it is not obvious what the critics suppose we might try. (There is, in fact, something to be said for a lottery for half the places; the top 10 or 15% of applicants would walk in under any system, and the bottom 15% are, for all sorts of reasons, not going to thrive at Oxford. What happens to the middle 70% is already closer to a lottery than most of us like to acknowledge. An open and above-board lottery might actually cause less misery than the present system.) </p> <p>There are many things about Laura Spence's case that myth-making reporters are not very likely to notice. One is that critics of Oxbridge chronically confuse qualification and entitlement. Just about everyone who applies to Oxford is \"qualified\". That is, all but about 15% could cope with the courses they want to take, and they'd get out at the other end with an upper or lower second. But teachers and journalists talk as if being qualified was the same thing as being entitled to a place, and it simply can't be. </p> <p>In most subjects, three perfectly good applicants are turned away for every one that can be taken. In medicine, it can be as many as six or seven who are turned away. Indeed, throughout the country, there are thousands of students who have not been accepted at medical schools. Are they bad students? Not a bit. They are simply the ones that tutors working with the limited evidence at their disposal think would do less well than their competitors. The situation at Oxbridge and other elite universities is very much like the finals of the Olympics. To call a sprinter who is edged out by two hundredths of a second \"slow\" is perfectly crazy; to think that students who are edged out of an Oxford place have been declared \"inadequate\" is equally crazy. Who, one might ask, do the reporters and Laura Spence's headteacher suppose should have been refused a place so that she could go to Oxford? </p> <p>Why do teachers from state schools think they are discriminated against? The answer is depressingly simple. It is a matter of numbers. A school such as Winchester or Manchester Grammar has dozens of sixth-formers applying for Oxford and Cambridge every year. And every year lots of their pupils are turned down by Oxford and Cambridge. Give or take the occasional indignant letter from an outraged teacher who thinks that only some dark combination of stupidity and malice can account for a college's failure to take some dazzling pupil, they put up with the fact that Oxford's judgment on its pupils is not always in line with their own. After all, dozens of their pupils do get in. </p> <p>Leaving aside extraordinary places such as Hills Road Sixth Form College in Cambridge, which is a powerhouse like very few others, most state schools will not send many applicants to Oxbridge each year. Once you have very small numbers of applicants, a school's hopes are bound to be more invested in them than would be the case if there were hordes of them. If three students apply and two are rejected, it looks like a terrible snub. </p> <p>So, what of the fact that Oxford says no to a young woman to whom Harvard says yes? And what of the fact that Harvard apparently coughs up \u00a365,000 so that she can take up the place? A Harvard education costs more than \u00a320,000 a year; four years of that comes to \u00a380,000. Harvard University has an endowment of some $14bn. It is an institution that promises every student who applies that, if they are accepted, Harvard will ensure they can afford to go. This is what is meant by \"need-blind admissions\", practised by every Ivy League university and by most of the best liberal arts colleges. </p> <p>It is a very good system, but what Laura Spence has been offered is what any US student from a modest background would get from Princeton, Yale, Dartmouth and the rest. It will be a means-tested award, and some of it will be in the form of loans, and some of it will be in form of work on campus. So, far from being something glamorous, extraordinary, and a slap in the face for Oxford, it is exactly what a few hundred English students will have been offered this year, along with many thousands of Americans. </p> <p>And although Harvard is perhaps the best large research university in the world - just as Princeton is quite clearly the best small research university in the world - its standards for undergraduate admission are lower than Oxford's. They have to be. US students leave school a year earlier than English students, and American high school courses are less academically demanding than A level. American deans of admissions sigh over students from Britain, Hong Kong and Singapore and murmur phrases like \"so intellectually mature\". Laura Spence has been lucky in having an American headteacher who knew how to apply to Harvard. She will have a very good time at Harvard. And, with any luck, she will while she is there learn the sort of respect for the complexity of the truth that will make her a good doctor - but which would have killed this silly little story in its cradle. </p> <p>Alan Ryan is warden of New College, Oxford.</p>",

Laura Spence's headteacher made a great to-do about her having 10 A and A* grades in GCSE; but every candidate for admission has 10 or more A and A* grades in GCSE and almost all of them will go on to get a minimum of three A grades at A level. You need some way of picking the one applicant you can take from among the three or four who look equally well qualified on paper. Oxford got rid of entrance examinations because it was thought that it would make life easier for applicants from state schools; and now it seems that interviews are the trouble. Short of offering places by lottery to anyone who shows up with 10 A or A* grades at GCSE, it is not obvious what the critics suppose we might try. (There is, in fact, something to be said for a lottery for half the places; the top 10 or 15% of applicants would walk in under any system, and the bottom 15% are, for all sorts of reasons, not going to thrive at Oxford. What happens to the middle 70% is already closer to a lottery than most of us like to acknowledge. An open and above-board lottery might actually cause less misery than the present system.) There are many things about Laura Spence's case that myth-making reporters are not very likely to notice. One is that critics of Oxbridge chronically confuse qualification and entitlement. Just about everyone who applies to Oxford is \"qualified\". That is, all but about 15% could cope with the courses they want to take, and they'd get out at the other end with an upper or lower second. But teachers and journalists talk as if being qualified was the same thing as being entitled to a place, and it simply can't be. In most subjects, three perfectly good applicants are turned away for every one that can be taken. In medicine, it can be as many as six or seven who are turned away. Indeed, throughout the country, there are thousands of students who have not been accepted at medical schools. Are they bad students? Not a bit. They are simply the ones that tutors working with the limited evidence at their disposal think would do less well than their competitors. The situation at Oxbridge and other elite universities is very much like the finals of the Olympics. To call a sprinter who is edged out by two hundredths of a second \"slow\" is perfectly crazy; to think that students who are edged out of an Oxford place have been declared \"inadequate\" is equally crazy. Who, one might ask, do the reporters and Laura Spence's headteacher suppose should have been refused a place so that she could go to Oxford? Why do teachers from state schools think they are discriminated against? The answer is depressingly simple. It is a matter of numbers. A school such as Winchester or Manchester Grammar has dozens of sixth-formers applying for Oxford and Cambridge every year. And every year lots of their pupils are turned down by Oxford and Cambridge. Give or take the occasional indignant letter from an outraged teacher who thinks that only some dark combination of stupidity and malice can account for a college's failure to take some dazzling pupil, they put up with the fact that Oxford's judgment on its pupils is not always in line with their own. After all, dozens of their pupils do get in. Leaving aside extraordinary places such as Hills Road Sixth Form College in Cambridge, which is a powerhouse like very few others, most state schools will not send many applicants to Oxbridge each year. Once you have very small numbers of applicants, a school's hopes are bound to be more invested in them than would be the case if there were hordes of them. If three students apply and two are rejected, it looks like a terrible snub. So, what of the fact that Oxford says no to a young woman to whom Harvard says yes? And what of the fact that Harvard apparently coughs up \u00a365,000 so that she can take up the place? A Harvard education costs more than \u00a320,000 a year; four years of that comes to \u00a380,000. Harvard University has an endowment of some $14bn. It is an institution that promises every student who applies that, if they are accepted, Harvard will ensure they can afford to go. This is what is meant by \"need-blind admissions\", practised by every Ivy League university and by most of the best liberal arts colleges. It is a very good system, but what Laura Spence has been offered is what any US student from a modest background would get from Princeton, Yale, Dartmouth and the rest. It will be a means-tested award, and some of it will be in the form of loans, and some of it will be in form of work on campus. So, far from being something glamorous, extraordinary, and a slap in the face for Oxford, it is exactly what a few hundred English students will have been offered this year, along with many thousands of Americans. And although Harvard is perhaps the best large research university in the world - just as Princeton is quite clearly the best small research university in the world - its standards for undergraduate admission are lower than Oxford's. They have to be. US students leave school a year earlier than English students, and American high school courses are less academically demanding than A level. American deans of admissions sigh over students from Britain, Hong Kong and Singapore and murmur phrases like \"so intellectually mature\". Laura Spence has been lucky in having an American headteacher who knew how to apply to Harvard. She will have a very good time at Harvard. And, with any luck, she will while she is there learn the sort of respect for the complexity of the truth that will make her a good doctor - but which would have killed this silly little story in its cradle.

Woodhead, who is seen as no friend of education authorities, said he supported the government's drive to privatise education services in areas where there was poor delivery. \"It seems to me right and proper that if the authority has demonstrated it is incapable of doing the job ... then we've got to look to someone else to do it,\" he said. But what is interesting about the latest batch of critical reports is that it raises serious questions about whether the government was right to pursue its controversial policy of \"naming and shaming\" failing schools before it had examined the more serious, long-standing problems lurking in town halls.",

We began campaigning for a change in the treatment of children involved in prostitution in the early 1990s when it became apparent that some children who had run away from home had resorted to selling sex to survive. Our campaign was shocking, but so was the subject. We needed to highlight the fact that children as young as 12 - and in one case a 10-year-old - were being cautioned for offences relating to prostitution. Children, we discovered, were being punished for being abused. </p> <p>We were met with disbelief and anger by some. It was somehow easy to believe that child prostitution existed thousands of miles away but not on our own doorstep. </p> <p>Yet the debate only mirrored an outcry in Victorian times, 120 years ago.

One police officer told the committee that, in London, children above the age of 13 could be procured \"without any difficulty whatsoever\". Another spoke of how it was \"scarcely possible for anyone between nine o'clock in the evening, and one o'clock in the morning to walk along Pentonville Road without being accosted by about a dozen young girls between 13 and 14 years of age\". </p> <p>The famous editor of the Pall Mall Gazette, William Stead, launched an investigative campaign to uncover the extent of child prostitution by visiting brothels, and actually bought a child prostitute for himself to expose the double standards of the Victorian public. Stead was a brilliant publicist and before long the country was in uproar. A mass demonstration of 250,000 people converged on Trafalgar Square to demand an increase in the age of consent. In 1885, the Criminal Law Amendment Act was passed, raising the age of consent to 16. </p> <p>Yet exactly a century later, in 1985, when The Children's Society opened Britain's first refuge for child runaways, we found that chil dren were still selling themselves on the streets to get money for food and shelter. </p> <p>Through our work with child runaways and in our research, we found that this appalling form of abuse is often accompanied by sickening violence, drug abuse and horrendous risk to health and life. </p> <p>Melanie, a girl we interviewed in our report, One Way Street, told us that she was abused from the age of three by her brother, followed at the age of five by her godfather and later by his friend.

      "body": "<p>Just over a week ago, Will \"Love Rat\" Carling was photographed playing with Henry, his two-year-old son with Ali Cockayne. The next day, he was photographed on the steps of the high court, where he was demanding greater access to his son. No decision was taken at the 90-minute hearing and the case was adjourned until later this year. But the show goes on. Last Sunday, the cameras were out again: this time, a tearful Cockayne was snapped handing Henry to Carling for one of his regular access days. </p> <p>Most separated parents manage to bury the hatchet for long enough to sort out by themselves their children's living arrangements, visits and holidays. But for the 15% who cannot or will not, the only solution lies in court, where a judge must resolve their rows about contact and residence. </p> <p>Before they get anywhere near a judge, however, the Children Act requires that a warring couple have a meeting with a family court welfare officer (FCWO). While Carling plays out his personal family drama on the public stage, it is these shadowy figures who, behind closed doors, assess the family scene, draw up a thorough report and, finally, make recommendations to the judge. </p> <p>FCWOs are currently probation officers but that is set to change when, in March 2001, a new service, the children and family court advisory service (Cafcas), will embrace all children's services. Not before time, according to Jess Oliver, an FCWO in Peterborough. \"People panic when they get letters with probation service at the top,\" she points out. \"They think they've done something criminal.\" </p> <p>What it won't do, however, is make the FCWO's job any easier. \"Given the degree of fury in the air,\" Oliver says, \"you sometimes wonder how the children ever came to be conceived in the first place. The other day I met the most ordinary man: cardigan-wearer, worked in a bank. And then there was his wife, bedizened with exotic eastern gear - a belly dancer, it turned out.\" </p> <p>However different parents might be, the FCWO's job is to promote the child's right to contact with both - no mean feat when emotions are running high. \"People leap to their feet, shouting: 'If I stay here another moment, I shall hit her/him.' They often storm out,\" says Brian Kirby, senior FCWO in Peterbrough. Though violence is rare, the threat of it is often felt: \"We know that as many as one in three of the separations we deal with is riddled with physical aggression.\" </p> <p>Oliver recalls a recent case where parents were rowing over whether or not a child should be taken to Henley Regatta: \"Quite suddenly, the mother swung round and just cracked the father over the head with the file she was holding.\" </p> <p>In another case, two enormous extended families turned up for the court hearing. \"We had to arrange separate exits and even then there was a major dust-up in the car park. Oddly, when brought together alone, the actual couple agreed their differences before the case was heard.\" </p> <p>If this first interview doesn't work, the FCWO will visit the child's school or nursery and both homes, taking time to talk to the child alone. The resulting report is long and detailed, and as judges usually follow its recommendations, it can be an alarming process for parents. </p> <p>\"You know that this person is forming opinions about you that could shatter your life,\" says one mother who was recently \"grilled\" by FCWOs. \"Even when you know you have done everything as well as you can, you feel disturbed by it. You know how much is riding on this interview.\" </p> <p>Howard Bramwell of Manchester probation service has deeper worries about the process. \"By definition, at least one person in every couple we see is difficult,\" he explains. \"Yet the system favours the ones who dig in and refuse to compromise.\" </p> <p>Men and women can be equally at fault here. \"There are the depressing cases of abusive, bullying men whose contact applications to the court are simply ploys to pursue a woman who has otherwise left their ambit,\" Bramwell explains. </p> <p>On the other hand, a parent with contact - often the mother - can be bitterly determined that her ex will not see the child. One mother, while being interviewed by a FCWO, greeted a telephone call from the father with: \"Is this you, you piece of filth?\" But at least such cases of outright hostility are straightforward, unlike the brainwashing practised by more sophisticated clients. \"I was on a home visit the other day,\" Oliver says, \"when the mother began to cry.

      "bodyText": "Just over a week ago, Will \"Love Rat\" Carling was photographed playing with Henry, his two-year-old son with Ali Cockayne. The next day, he was photographed on the steps of the high court, where he was demanding greater access to his son. No decision was taken at the 90-minute hearing and the case was adjourned until later this year. But the show goes on. Last Sunday, the cameras were out again: this time, a tearful Cockayne was snapped handing Henry to Carling for one of his regular access days. Most separated parents manage to bury the hatchet for long enough to sort out by themselves their children's living arrangements, visits and holidays. But for the 15% who cannot or will not, the only solution lies in court, where a judge must resolve their rows about contact and residence. Before they get anywhere near a judge, however, the Children Act requires that a warring couple have a meeting with a family court welfare officer (FCWO). While Carling plays out his personal family drama on the public stage, it is these shadowy figures who, behind closed doors, assess the family scene, draw up a thorough report and, finally, make recommendations to the judge. FCWOs are currently probation officers but that is set to change when, in March 2001, a new service, the children and family court advisory service (Cafcas), will embrace all children's services. Not before time, according to Jess Oliver, an FCWO in Peterborough. \"People panic when they get letters with probation service at the top,\" she points out. \"They think they've done something criminal.\" What it won't do, however, is make the FCWO's job any easier. \"Given the degree of fury in the air,\" Oliver says, \"you sometimes wonder how the children ever came to be conceived in the first place. The other day I met the most ordinary man: cardigan-wearer, worked in a bank. And then there was his wife, bedizened with exotic eastern gear - a belly dancer, it turned out.\" However different parents might be, the FCWO's job is to promote the child's right to contact with both - no mean feat when emotions are running high. \"People leap to their feet, shouting: 'If I stay here another moment, I shall hit her/him.' They often storm out,\" says Brian Kirby, senior FCWO in Peterbrough. Though violence is rare, the threat of it is often felt: \"We know that as many as one in three of the separations we deal with is riddled with physical aggression.\" Oliver recalls a recent case where parents were rowing over whether or not a child should be taken to Henley Regatta: \"Quite suddenly, the mother swung round and just cracked the father over the head with the file she was holding.\" In another case, two enormous extended families turned up for the court hearing. \"We had to arrange separate exits and even then there was a major dust-up in the car park. Oddly, when brought together alone, the actual couple agreed their differences before the case was heard.\" If this first interview doesn't work, the FCWO will visit the child's school or nursery and both homes, taking time to talk to the child alone. The resulting report is long and detailed, and as judges usually follow its recommendations, it can be an alarming process for parents. \"You know that this person is forming opinions about you that could shatter your life,\" says one mother who was recently \"grilled\" by FCWOs. \"Even when you know you have done everything as well as you can, you feel disturbed by it. You know how much is riding on this interview.\" Howard Bramwell of Manchester probation service has deeper worries about the process. \"By definition, at least one person in every couple we see is difficult,\" he explains. \"Yet the system favours the ones who dig in and refuse to compromise.\" Men and women can be equally at fault here. \"There are the depressing cases of abusive, bullying men whose contact applications to the court are simply ploys to pursue a woman who has otherwise left their ambit,\" Bramwell explains. On the other hand, a parent with contact - often the mother - can be bitterly determined that her ex will not see the child. One mother, while being interviewed by a FCWO, greeted a telephone call from the father with: \"Is this you, you piece of filth?\" But at least such cases of outright hostility are straightforward, unlike the brainwashing practised by more sophisticated clients. \"I was on a home visit the other day,\" Oliver says, \"when the mother began to cry. Her small child climbed on her knee and said: 'It's all right, Mummy, I won't see Daddy again if it makes you unhappy'.\" On one Christmas visit, another FCWO remembers a child weeping over his toys in a corner. \"Just look at all this you've got. Why are you crying?\" the FCWO said cheerily. \"Because my Dad's a bastard!\" the five-year-old replied. Looking on, the mother said triumphantly: \"You see now, don't you? He hates him!\" Worst of all, though, Oliver says, are accusations of child abuse, \"When you just know it's a ruse to stop contact. Unfounded accusations like this are a form of child abuse in themselves.\" \"All sorts of excuses are made for parents like these,\" Bramwell adds. \"Many are emotionally immature and cannot separate their own needs from their children's.

But many are middle-class, otherwise blameless characters and they are allowed to defy the law with impunity.\" Kirby takes a more sympathetic line. \"People are in pain, in crisis,\" he says. \"We are trained to deal with all this, take the temperature down, take breaks, mediate, agree where we can.

Our young tester loved the yellow sun face perched on top of the pod with his huge grin and rather trendy shades. Unlike larger pools, blowing this one up won't leave you in a heaving heap (it takes about 15 minutes). Because of its size, emptying is easy, with a simple plug to release the water.

Its impressive measurements are 255cm by 165cm, making it large enough for several children at once, and the odd adult in need of cooling down. The downside is that it needs a lot of water, which may not be a problem when you fill it up, but when it comes to emptying, what do you do with it?

The enclosed space, although small, can be filled with sand by those keen to create a beach and the low side height makes it easy to climb in and out.

However, once up, the children couldn't stay away. The steering wheel and squeaky horn are hidden under a shaded area which means there is a cool corner for anyone overheating. The detachable hose was considered a plus by children and a minus by wet adults. Essentially, this is a novelty pool which encourages water-shy children to get wet and have fun. The potential depth (63cm) may be off-putting for the nervous, as may the high sides which make getting in and out difficult for younger ones, but there is a recommended maximum water level of 29cm.

The winner of musical chairs is the child who has the right combination of aggression and body weight to knock a competitor off their seat and sit tight while they take a swing at them. As such, it has been identified in a report published this week as a game that encourages children to be aggressive and should be phased out in favour of its gentler stable mate, musical statues. Ironically, it coincides with a report published by a scholar at the University of North London, arguing that toy guns should be allowed back into the nursery as encouragers of imaginative play. </p> <p>The question of how to deal with aggression in children relies on one's definition of its cause and function. If, as Sue Finch, the author of the report, Towards a Non-Violent Society, believes, a child who acts violently is copying bad behaviour they have witnessed in others, then musical chairs reads as a tutorial on how to whack your little playmates under the approving eye of an adult. It is a view that has been endorsed by the employment minister, Margaret Hodge. If, on the other hand, you believe that the violence children display is an innate and not necessarily damaging impulse, then something like musical chairs becomes a healthy outlet for natural aggression. </p> <p>It is a fiercely contested field in child psychology, and one that can still be characterised by the disagreement that raged between two groundbreaking psychologists in the 1940s, Melanie Klein and Donald Winnicott. \"Melanie Klein believed all babies are born with the death instinct,\" says Jan Abram, the director of the Squiggle Foundation and author of the Language of Winnicott. \"The death instinct is an innate envy, sadism and aggression. Winnicott disagreed with this, and saw babies' primary aggression to be benign. He put the emphasis on how the mother treated the child, channelling the aggression into assertion.\" </p> <p>For Winnicott, while a baby can certainly be ruthless, it is meaningless to attribute emotions such as envy to it, since it has yet to reach that stage of cognitive development. The ruthless child is not, according to Winnicott, behaving with intentional cruelty, but with a pre-conscious, pre-guilt inducing selfishness. The baby is testing the boundaries between itself and its mother, learning slowly that when it pinches her, the baby does not feel pain, distinguishing the difference between \"me\" and \"not-me\". Aggression, in this sense, is not the expression of some essential sadism, but a natural development in the child's journey to independence, creating a context in which pushing another child is done with a dim awareness of the consequences. </p> <p>Whichever side one falls down on, it is an uncontested fact that the way in which a parent reacts to a child's violent behaviour is crucial to the way in which its aggressive tendencies develop. The \"terrible twos\" is the phase during which the expression of this sadism/ruthlessness is most flamboyantly expressed. Infants may pinch and scratch their mother, pull terrified faces and have tantrums, as a way of testing her emotional response to their distress. \"We are all born homicidal maniacs,\" says Peter Fonagy, Freud memorial professor at UCL and a consultant on Bill Clinton's commission on violence prevention. \"Every infant is born impulsive. Aggression in infancy is a normal response to anxiety that isn't met by comforting.\" </p> <p>\"All infants are born with the capacity for destructive impulses based on anxiety,\" says Margot Waddell, psychoanalyst and consultant child psychotherapist at the Tavistock Clinic. \"If the primary carer can understand it and react appropriately, then those aggressive impulses will be more contained. But if the baby's distress comes up against a brick wall and bounces back, then the infant or the young child will find it more difficult to keep their natural impulses under control.\" The responsible adult, therefore, understands the child's need to occasionally hurl itself at other children, without actually endorsing it. </p> <p>The key word in all of this, is containment. It is well known that a child throwing a tantrum is testing the boundaries of its carer. Psychoanalysts talk about the need for the parent to \"detoxify\" the situation, not to over-react with erratic punishment, but to absorb their child's anger and understand the frustration that might be causing it. </p> <p>\"Anxiety is at bottom, a fear of death,\" says Robert Young, professor of psychotherapy at the University of Sheffield. \"It is a fear of non-being, a nameless dread. People who are feeling that way must be held, metaphorically, not too tight, not too lose, until the desperation drains away. You have to find safe outlets and I would have thought musical chairs is an excellent one. People who try and get their children to always be good are really building up trouble for the future.\" </p> <p>Detoxifying aggressive behaviour in US schools is something that Peter Fonagy has worked on extensively. In Tulsa, he helped implement the Gentle Warrior Programme, a martial arts course that allowed children to exercise their aggression while teaching them self-defensive moves and how to stand up to bullies. \"There are studies that have suggested that classroom aggression can be modified by a more systematic use of discipline,\" he says. \"If the teachers use more positive intervention, trying to praise the child rather than humiliate him, it can be a constructive and powerful lesson to the others. They must sensitise the whole class to aggression and show that they do not tolerate it.\" It is not enough simply to ban an aggressive activity, since this is a symptom rather than a cause of the problem. \"It's not like getting rid of a bacteria or a virus. No single activity will in itself either create the problem or deal with it. At school, it needs to be a system-wide approach. If you get rid of musical chairs because it is against a principle that you hold that is relevant to preventing violence, then fine. But it needs to be accompanied by many other implementations of that principle.\" </p> <p> The principle is founded on the belief that as children become older, inadequate responses to their emotional demands may provoke them into using violence as a means of boosting their self-esteem. \"Inadequacy\" in this context can range from obvious parental abuse and neglect, to the more insidious problem of over-indulgence. Psychoanalysts have talked of the tyranny of structurelessness, of the danger of tolerating a child's whims in a way that can be as damaging to them as over-punishment, since a child's psychology is a fragile, impressionable thing. </p> <p>Expressing aggression is not in itself damaging; playing competitive games does not induce the child prematurely into the cut-throat world of adulthood. \"There is no evidence suggesting that schools where there is greater competitiveness between the kids creates more aggression,\" says Fonagy. \"If aggression is allowed to be a means by which a child whose self-esteem is low can enhance their self-esteem, that's bad.\" The answer, perhaps, is not to ban musical chairs, but to make sure that the little sod who wins by pushing other children out of the way, is not awarded the prize.</p>",

However, with an extra sensitive mouth and a startle reflex which sends his arms and legs shooting out and his head back, I felt nervous about how the extraction was going to be achieved. </p> <p>The consultant at the orthodontics surgery seemed reluctant to consider a general anaesthetic, but the very nice orthodontist peered at Alex over the top of his glasses and declared himself willing to pull them out in the normal manner: \"If he jerks away they'll just come out quicker!\" He also agreed to Alex staying in his wheelchair which would mean that at least his lower body would be strapped down. </p> <p>I took to this man straight away - we have to deal with so many medical professionals, and the ones I dread are those who get so fazed by cerebral palsy that they've failed before they've begun: the locum who visited Alex when he had flu, and demanded a blow-by blow account of Alex's birth; the speech therapist who thought that Alex's undeveloped speech meant she should carry out endless cognitive tests; the radiologist who took one look at the wheelchair and declared that the X ray would be impossible - \"Well, that won't fit, will it?\" (Later, when I had got him settled on cushions under the camera, she shoved a metal clamp into his mouth with no warning. Alex squirmed, as any child would - more evidence, in her eyes, that he was, indeed, an unsuitable candidate for x-ray). </p> <p>But Mr Hodges seemed calm and confident, and he had a sense of humour. Thank God, because we ended up unable to keep Alex still long enough for the extremely long thin needle to go in, and he had to yank all four eye teeth out at great speed with no more than a pair of pliers and a tube of pink anaesthetic gel. The blood flowed and Alex yelled, and in no more than a minute it was done. </p> <p>Only a couple of hours later, while I still shook, Alex was cheerfully eating spaghetti hoops and demanding chocolate cake for bravery. The teeth have rather long pointy roots. Alex has taken them to school today in a box to show everyone. I'm having the day off to recover.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It was announced that Alex had to have four milk teeth out, to make way for his adult ones. Not unusual: lots of kids have overcrowding problems. However, with an extra sensitive mouth and a startle reflex which sends his arms and legs shooting out and his head back, I felt nervous about how the extraction was going to be achieved. The consultant at the orthodontics surgery seemed reluctant to consider a general anaesthetic, but the very nice orthodontist peered at Alex over the top of his glasses and declared himself willing to pull them out in the normal manner: \"If he jerks away they'll just come out quicker!\" He also agreed to Alex staying in his wheelchair which would mean that at least his lower body would be strapped down. I took to this man straight away - we have to deal with so many medical professionals, and the ones I dread are those who get so fazed by cerebral palsy that they've failed before they've begun: the locum who visited Alex when he had flu, and demanded a blow-by blow account of Alex's birth; the speech therapist who thought that Alex's undeveloped speech meant she should carry out endless cognitive tests; the radiologist who took one look at the wheelchair and declared that the X ray would be impossible - \"Well, that won't fit, will it?\" (Later, when I had got him settled on cushions under the camera, she shoved a metal clamp into his mouth with no warning. Alex squirmed, as any child would - more evidence, in her eyes, that he was, indeed, an unsuitable candidate for x-ray). But Mr Hodges seemed calm and confident, and he had a sense of humour. Thank God, because we ended up unable to keep Alex still long enough for the extremely long thin needle to go in, and he had to yank all four eye teeth out at great speed with no more than a pair of pliers and a tube of pink anaesthetic gel. The blood flowed and Alex yelled, and in no more than a minute it was done. Only a couple of hours later, while I still shook, Alex was cheerfully eating spaghetti hoops and demanding chocolate cake for bravery. The teeth have rather long pointy roots. Alex has taken them to school today in a box to show everyone. I'm having the day off to recover.",

      "body": "<p>Doctor Taylor and his colleagues at Bradgate surgery in Bristol were puzzled. They felt their medical skills made little impact when it came to influencing their patients' long-term health. Whatever they tried, the health statistics remained the same - and the high health need continued. The doctors were also puzzled because Henbury and Brentry in north Bristol seemed such nice, leafy suburbs. So what was going on? </p> <p>They decided to find out for themselves. They took the unique step of commissioning a profile of the area to give them a fuller picture of the community in which their patients lived: not only their ages, health and housing, but the quality of their lives - the local crime rate, environmental issues, employment patterns and poverty. Did any of these factors affect their patients' health? </p> <p>They wanted a holistic picture so they could begin to identify and treat the causes of ill health as well as the symptoms. What they revealed was health statistics that far exceeded the national average and seemed at odds with what appears to be desirable, leafy suburbia. </p> <p>It is a fascinating survey of photographs, tables of statistics, health profiles, current services for families and children as well as older people. The report is fast becoming a teaching aid in local universities and colleges and is already into its third reprint since April. </p> <p>The profile shows a community dominated by two polarised groups - a mostly transient group of young, single parents in council accommodation (aged 16 to 24) and a preponderance of elderly people (aged 65 to 80) who moved to the area after the war as young families and have grown old together. Both groups are the products of different eras, different housing policies, employment patterns, poverty and the breakdown of traditional family structures. All this adds up to a lack of identity as a community. </p> <p>These two disparate groups actually have a lot in common. Both are heavily dependent on health and social services. They both rely on benefits. But, whereas the older population and many of their children form a stable, settled community owning or renting houses in the area, a very different picture emerges for single parents renting council flats. </p> <p>Tina is a typical example. She is a 20-year-old single parent of two young daughters. They were re-housed to a council block in Henbury because of domestic violence. The flat is OK, according to Tina, but she desperately wants a house with a garden so her children can play safely. </p> <p>\"I can't let them play in the garden at the back of the flats because it's not safe,\" she says. \"There are often needles left lying around by drug addicts, and I can't take the risk.\" The area is not enclosed, so Tina has to be outside with them and says that some of the other kids that play there are a bad influence. </p> <p>Tina wants her doctor to prescribe pills for depression. \"It really gets me down being shut in so much with the kids,\" she says. \"They drive me mad sometimes. And I can't afford to keep taking them out every day unless we go to the park. I don't have any friends or family here and I get fed up.\" </p> <p>Her situation mirrors that of many young mothers in the area living in poverty and ill health, alienated from their communities and unsupported by their families. They are a perfect example of one of the most pressing issues of the nation's health - the widening inequality between the richest and poorest outlined in the Acheson commission's report last year. </p> <p>All the most telling indicators of poor health abound. These include low birth weight babies - \"the most important single cause of preventable infant death\" which \"can also be an indicator of illness in later life\". Leafy Henbury has the highest rate in the Avon health authority area: 13.1%, more than double the city average of 6.4%. The domino effect of social factors such as poor parental care, diet, family stress, poverty and smoking are, not surprisingly, linked. </p> <p>In Hanbury, reported maternal depression is 17%, compared with a city average of 13.4%; 90% of children aged 18-30 months were reported as having a cough in the same period; and 22% of all Henbury patients aged six to 14 are registered as having asthma. </p> <p>Add to this the high health need evident in the older group, where statistics reveal record rates of long-term illness, heart disease, hypertension and diabetes. These high rates, concludes the research, can be partly linked to the high smoking rates and body mass index (overweight). </p> <p>Then throw in equally high rates of mental illness, psychiatric admissions and depression, especially among women, as well as high rates of drug dependence, especially in young men, and it becomes clear why Taylor and his partners had been puzzled. </p> <p>Research like this boosts the government's argument, set out in Saving Lives: Our Healthier Nation, that health improvement programmes should be tailored to local circumstances. So what do the Bristol doctors hope to do about it? And how can they encourage people like Tina to live more healthily? </p> <p>\"Tackling causes of ill-health, such as poor housing or stress, could pay dividends,\" says Taylor. \"Many patients' basic needs are simply not being met.\" </p> <p>A lot of young, single parents are not attending the parent education classes before or after having their babies, and are therefore not getting additional help. Taylor thinks one reason is that the clinic serves a wide area, including mothers they have little in common with - mostly well-heeled, professional women who tend to be older, better educated and with partners. While this group forges bonds and friendships, some younger, single mums miss out, becoming isolated and stressed. </p> <p>The research has led the health team to start looking at ways of changing things. Recently a local parenting skills project was set up to help parents bond with their children. \"It's great to be able to tell them about it when they are depressed and having difficulties with their childrens' behaviour instead of prescribing medication,\" says Taylor. The same applies to the older population, where social factors may also contribute to poor health - often because simple needs are overlooked. </p> <p> Taylor sees himself as part of a team where identifying and providing for patients' needs are vital if they want to make an impact on their health rather than \"fire fighting\" in the surgery. He stresses the importance of a multi-agency approach, using resources efficiently by working in partnership to produce local services, often with government money available through funding. </p> <p>This practice is not the only one in the UK concerned to treat the causes of ill health. Sandwell council and health authority, West Midlands, recognises the impact of poor housing on health and doctors involved in this scheme are prescribing not only medication but housing repairs in an attempt to improve the health of asthmatic children living in cold, damp homes - at a cost of up to \u00a34,000 for each family. </p> <p>The Bristol findings fit neatly with the government's renewed emphasis on healthy living rather than the erstwhile aim of living longer. But this costs, and those patients who cannot pay privately for the privilege are still dependent even on enlightened surgeries to meet their needs.</p>",

But this costs, and those patients who cannot pay privately for the privilege are still dependent even on enlightened surgeries to meet their needs.",

The alternative approach, pioneered in Chicago, was to look at such communities through a new lens which combines community development with commercial skills.

The message from the US is that this is true - up to a point. There are very few people in the disadvantaged areas to be targeted who are desperately trying to raise money to finance their great business idea. But community entrepreneurs in Chicago and elsewhere have shown there is a latent demand.

She first has to raise some money to lend to those people. To kick off the process, there will be \u00a31m of ICOF funds available through LRS, plus \u00a30.5m of NatWest money. But if it is to work, the body needs its own funding - up to \u00a320m over seven years - most of which is expected to come from government or the European Union.

Unlike its namesake on the eastern seaboard of the US, it's hardly a bustling metropolis. Indeed, it's a rather isolated town of 60,000 souls, close to the east coast of England and surrounded by flat fields. </p> <p>One of those fields provides pitches for Boston rugby football club. The white goal posts form one of the few deviations from the horizontal as far as the eye can see. Along with some adjoining agricultural land, this will be the site of Boston's biggest claim to fame since medieval masons bequeathed it one of the tallest church towers in the country, ironically known as The Stump. </p> <p>Here, on the edge of town, is to be built a world-first athletics stadium with state-of-the-art facilities to make it fully accessible to disabled as well as able-bodied athletes. </p> <p>From the trackside toilets to the wide doors, the ramps in the viewing areas to the Braille guide rails, everything is to be designed with wheelchair-users, amputees or the visually impaired in mind. </p> <p>No other town or city will have anything quite like it. Not Barcelona, Atlanta, Sidney or anywhere else that has staged a modern Olympics. And certainly not Boston, Massachussetts. \"They tried something similar a few years ago and failed,\" says Mark James, chief executive of Boston borough council. </p> <p>The hint of a smile suggests that he is confident that Boston, England, will not fail. And with some justification. Although the \u00a33m put aside by local councillors is less than half of the estimated cost, a head of steam is building up behind the project which suggests that the additional \u00a34.5m will not be too difficult to raise. </p> <p>Some 32 charities worldwide have made pledges and a dozen companies are being lined up for commercial sponsorship. An application for a national lottery grant is also in the offing. A big company, Granada, has already agreed to manage the stadium and to run a profit-making health and fitness club within the complex. </p> <p>Letters of support have come from New York and Canberra. Chris Nunn, head coach for athletes with disabilities at the Australian Institute of Sport, described the proposal as \"the most exciting facility I have heard of\". Closer to home, Dave Moorcroft, of UK Athletics, has professed himself \"very impressed\" with the plans and offered enthusiastic backing. </p> <p>The money-raising campaign was launched at the House of Lords, at a reception hosted by Lord Morris of Manchester, a former minister for the disabled. A chance meeting there stiffened Mark James's conviction that Boston was going to provide a much-needed facility. \"I was approached by a woman who turned out to be a disabled athlete,\" he recalls. \"She told me how she'd been to a meeting last year where she couldn't get her wheelchair into the shower. She'd had to lie on the floor and crawl out. If ever we had any doubts about what we're planning . . .\" </p> <p>The words trail away but the determination is all too evident. James is a dapper and dynamic Welshman who left Westminster council to come to Boston because he thought it was the sort of place where he could \"make a difference\". Just how much of a difference he could never have imagined. </p> <p>\"This has gone from being a local project to a national project to an international project,\" he muses. \"It's driving us.\" </p> <p>What drove him forward in the first place was a 45-minute telephone conversation with a remarkable 54-year-old blind grandmother called Mary Clark. Like many a resident of Boston, she had read in her local paper that the town was to have an athletics stadium for the first time. Local councillors had apparently been much impressed by proposals from the recently-promoted rugby club. In return for making their ground available for athletics meetings, the club would get a proper stand and indoor training facilities. </p> <p>That was all very well, thought Clark, but what about sportsmen and sportswomen with some kind of disability? If a new stadium was going to be built from scratch, then surely it should be for all potential competitors. </p> <p>Unlike most residents of Boston, she has had first-hand experience of stadiums around the world. Back in 1983, she broke a world record in the pentathlon (and the British record for the javelin) during the European Games for the visually impaired in Bulgaria. The following year, she won two silver medals at the Olympics for the disabled in New York and the year after that a silver and a bronze in Rome. </p> <p>Imagine what it must be like to run as fast or jump as far as you can without being able to see where you're going, and you have some measure of Clark's physical courage. \"I'm not a person,\" she says sweetly, \"to be shrugged off easily.\" </p> <p> Mark James is all too well aware of that. He had to be dragged out of a meeting by his secretary because Clark \"refused to take no for an answer\". Three-quarters of an hour later, he put the phone down and began to mull over her detailed proposals, which would add at least \u00a32.5m to the final cost. \"Only when we hired a consultant to look into it,\" says James, \"did we discover that this would be something highly unusual.\" Unique, in fact. </p> <p>\"If somebody's got to do it, why not little old Boston,\" beams Mary Clark. \"I'm just sorry that it didn't happen in my day. </p> <p>\"Only in the last 10 years has awareness grown about people with disabilities and the way they should be treated. As athletes, we had the same thrills and disappointments as anyone else.\" </p> <p>She's looking forward to taking her place in the new stadium's wheelchair-friendly stands, hopefully in August 2001. \"I have a friend who'll give me a running commentary,\" she says. \"There's nothing wrong with my ears.\"</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Prince Charles embarrassed the government and the scientific establishment with his Reith lecture on BBC Radio 4 last week. In his wide-ranging talk, which drew on the work of theologians, philosophers, scientists and economists, he said much that surely expressed the views of the majority in this country. Is it possible that the prince is more in touch with the common people than our elected government? </p> <p>The idea that there is a sacred trust under which human beings accept stewardship for the earth is common to most spiritual traditions, including those that do not acknowledge a creator. The prince urged us to recapture this sense of the sacred, in which we accept that there are bounds of balance, order and harmony in the natural world and that development is progress only if it is sustainable. He singled out gene biotechnology for attack as an unacceptable transgression of nature's limits, treating our entire world as a \"laboratory of life\" with potentially disastrous consequences. </p> <p>Did he attack science? Was he anti-science, as has been claimed? Not at all. Many scientists, myself included, were quite comfortable with what he said. His attack was aimed at the \"impenetrable layers of scientific rationalism\" (he might have said \"rationalisation\") that obscure our sense of the sacred and respect for the earth, and in the end lead us to regard the whole of nature, including human beings, as something that can be \"engineered for our own convenience or as a nuisance to be evaded and manipulated\". That view may indeed infect science, but is not at all inherent in it. </p> <p>Prince Charles was speaking for the people when he called for support for organic farming. Who could disagree when he argued that if a fraction of the money currently being invested in developing genetically manipulated crops was applied to understanding and improving traditional systems of agriculture, which have stood the all-important test of time, the results would be \"remarkable\"? </p> <p>There is already a holistic approach to sustainable agriculture that integrates indigenous with western science, and is adapted to local ecological and social conditions. Some 12.5m hectares world wide are successfully farmed in this way. Yields have doubled and tripled, and are continuing to increase far in excess of anything GM crops have to offer. Support for this is growing among farmers, trade unions, consumers, indigenous peoples and diverse public interest organisations. Not, however, from industry, because when farmers are free to keep their seeds, and to harvest and sell their produce locally, corporate monopolies cannot hold the hungry to ransom. </p> <p>Prince Charles could have taken heart from the fact that the mechanistic view is rapidly losing ground within contemporary western science. An organic revolution is sweeping across the disciplines, from quantum physics to the ecology of complexity and molecular genetics. Proponents of gene biotechnology are stuck in the mechanistic era, and our mainstream academic institutions are perpetrating the outmoded paradigm if only because it serves so well to promote the genetic engineering of life. </p> <p> The emerging science of the organism reinstates the holistic perspectives of indigenous cultures. It also reveals that the romantic poets' vision of the oneness of nature is the truly rational point of view, while the mechanistic tradition is deeply flawed and irrational. </p> <p>I was disappointed that he ended by saying that taking a cautious approach or achieving balance in life is never as much fun as the alternatives. He made it sound as if living in a sustainable world means leading a less satisfying life. Precisely the opposite is the case. Instead of being isolated and anxious in a culture dominated by competition and exploitation, we can look forward to experiencing the joy of being connected and sustained.</p> <p>\u0095 Dr Mae-Wan Ho, reader in biology at the Open University, is among a group of more than 300 scientists from 39 countries who are calling for a moratorium on environmental releases of GMOs and who support organic, sustainable agriculture.

In his wide-ranging talk, which drew on the work of theologians, philosophers, scientists and economists, he said much that surely expressed the views of the majority in this country. Is it possible that the prince is more in touch with the common people than our elected government? The idea that there is a sacred trust under which human beings accept stewardship for the earth is common to most spiritual traditions, including those that do not acknowledge a creator. The prince urged us to recapture this sense of the sacred, in which we accept that there are bounds of balance, order and harmony in the natural world and that development is progress only if it is sustainable. He singled out gene biotechnology for attack as an unacceptable transgression of nature's limits, treating our entire world as a \"laboratory of life\" with potentially disastrous consequences. Did he attack science? Was he anti-science, as has been claimed? Not at all. Many scientists, myself included, were quite comfortable with what he said. His attack was aimed at the \"impenetrable layers of scientific rationalism\" (he might have said \"rationalisation\") that obscure our sense of the sacred and respect for the earth, and in the end lead us to regard the whole of nature, including human beings, as something that can be \"engineered for our own convenience or as a nuisance to be evaded and manipulated\". That view may indeed infect science, but is not at all inherent in it. Prince Charles was speaking for the people when he called for support for organic farming. Who could disagree when he argued that if a fraction of the money currently being invested in developing genetically manipulated crops was applied to understanding and improving traditional systems of agriculture, which have stood the all-important test of time, the results would be \"remarkable\"? There is already a holistic approach to sustainable agriculture that integrates indigenous with western science, and is adapted to local ecological and social conditions. Some 12.5m hectares world wide are successfully farmed in this way. Yields have doubled and tripled, and are continuing to increase far in excess of anything GM crops have to offer. Support for this is growing among farmers, trade unions, consumers, indigenous peoples and diverse public interest organisations. Not, however, from industry, because when farmers are free to keep their seeds, and to harvest and sell their produce locally, corporate monopolies cannot hold the hungry to ransom. Prince Charles could have taken heart from the fact that the mechanistic view is rapidly losing ground within contemporary western science. An organic revolution is sweeping across the disciplines, from quantum physics to the ecology of complexity and molecular genetics. Proponents of gene biotechnology are stuck in the mechanistic era, and our mainstream academic institutions are perpetrating the outmoded paradigm if only because it serves so well to promote the genetic engineering of life. The emerging science of the organism reinstates the holistic perspectives of indigenous cultures. It also reveals that the romantic poets' vision of the oneness of nature is the truly rational point of view, while the mechanistic tradition is deeply flawed and irrational. I was disappointed that he ended by saying that taking a cautious approach or achieving balance in life is never as much fun as the alternatives. He made it sound as if living in a sustainable world means leading a less satisfying life. Precisely the opposite is the case. Instead of being isolated and anxious in a culture dominated by competition and exploitation, we can look forward to experiencing the joy of being connected and sustained. \u0095 Dr Mae-Wan Ho, reader in biology at the Open University, is among a group of more than 300 scientists from 39 countries who are calling for a moratorium on environmental releases of GMOs and who support organic, sustainable agriculture.

      "body": "<p>Here's how to spend a quater of a million quid or so on a garden. Call up Charles Funke Associates of Goldalming and ask for a \"garden of the night\" as commissioned by his highness, the Shaikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al-Nahyan for this year's Chelsea Flower Show. Very nice it is too, with its canopy, scented flowers, marble and lighting effects. Chelsea is also the place to be if you've only got \u00a325,000. For that you can buy a bronze of a bloke with a limp willy and a sick-looking cat on his shoulders. It's also where you will find a garden to represent (in the words of its designers) \"an allegorical journey from beginning to a higher goal representing someone embarking upon a new business venture with the scenes of mentoring and guiding, risk-taking innovation and energy\". </p> <p>Or a garden \"symbolising the chaotic activity of the heart following a cardiac arrest\". Pillars of rose quartz, instant labyrinth, rain forests, alpine pastures and even a Zen-inspired, dot.com-sponsored garden \"with an English twist\". </p> <p>Such is Chelsea and the British garden industry today: art and artifice, illusion and fantasy combined with the terrific skill of the world's greatest horticulturists. Or the most preposterous show on earth brought to you by stylists, makeover artists, designers, horticultural snobs and corporations trying to flog instant tranquillity, fashion and effect to an ever-more pressed and grotesque society. </p> <p>Chelsea this year is noticeably different. Gone is the famous old marquee, redolent of garden parties and flower shows up and down the country. In its place are two massive white sheds - or pavilions, as Sir Simon Hornby, president of the Royal Horticultural Society, likes to call them. The old marquee, he says, was \"discoloured and full of timber poles\". </p> <p>\"You could be anywhere now,\" says Lucia, a designer/plants-woman surveying the site last week, and dodging the lorry-loads of ceramic waterfalls, woven hazel fences, Victorian lighting, obelisks, parasols, penstemons, petunias and 100,000 other blooms. </p> <p>\"It looks like a Channel tunnel terminal or factory outlet,\" she says. \"The RHS used to be a great institution. Now it's all whizz kids and computers, spotty faces running the show who haven't a clue about plants. But if that's the way it's going - and some would say bloody good riddance to the past - then so be it.\" </p> <p>It is the way it's going. Gardening is now one of the fastest growing leisure industries in Britain, an essentially middle-class occupation serviced by up to 60,000 people. It is growing at a rate of 20% a year and in 1999 the public is estimated to have spent almost \u00a33bn on plants, a further \u00a38bn on decking, irrigation systems, ponds, pesticides, conservatories and all the extras of modern gardening - as well as an astonishing \u00a380m on garden gnomes and their upper-class equivalent, statuary. </p> <p>Three in four of us - a higher percentage than any other industrialised country - have a garden or some sort of outdoor space, even if only a window sill. Two out of three people, say the pollsters, garden as a hobby, making it the most popular British pastime. One in four women are said to enjoy gardening more than sex. More of us visit garden centres now than all the National Trust properties and theme parks combined. </p> <p>Meanwhile, superstores such as B&amp;Q and Homebase are getting in on the act, spotting a whole new profit line. Walmart, the huge US retail group which owns Asda, is expected to move in shortly. Television can't get enough of it and the celebrities, the politicians and the wannabes will all be at Chelsea this week. \"Gardening used to be full of mystique and mystery,\" says Jennifer Adams, head of the Royal Parks and a leading horticulturist. In the old days, she says, gardeners used to look up plants in catalogues, order months in advance and exchange specimens. No more. What was once a close-knit world with little money to spend has turned into a consumer-led phenomenon and an industry that is increasingly hi-tech. It draws much more on high fashion, art and design than on the qualities of plants. </p> <p> We may be buying more flowers than ever to beautify our homes or workspaces, but Britain, which has an international reputation for the most knowledgeable horticulturists in the world, is training ever fewer people with practical knowledge of plants. </p> <p>A combination of the end of the apprentice schemes run by local authorities and education policies which have denied grants to people wanting to study in horticultural centres of excellence, means that we are churning out each year many hundreds of garden designers and managers with academic qualifications but few of them prepared to get their hands dirty. Most degree courses need little or no practical experience. </p> <p>The problem is partly perception and fashion. Gardening is no longer on school curricula. Careers officers don't promote it and horticulture has been linked closely with agriculture which is seen to be in perpetual crisis. </p> <p>\"People are getting horticultural degrees without knowing the difference between hebes and sedges,\" says Pete Weston, editor of Horticulture Week. \"Nobody is going to college to learn how to propagate plants.\" </p> <p>The situation is so bad that companies are looking abroad for trained horticulturists - in Germany, Australia and Czechoslovakia, says John Richardson, chairman of Johnsons of Whixley, Britain's largest nursery stock growers. \"The international perception is that England is the origin of gardening,\" he says, \"but I'm terrified for the future. We are losing the stock of people who really know about plants. People do not want dirty-handed jobs anymore. The quality and standard of people being trained has dropped badly.\" </p> <p>Brian Donohue, who is Labour MP for Cunninghame South, Ayrshire, and works with the parliamentary horticulture and gardening group, says consumers need more protection and the burgeoning industry must have higher standards as the giant \"sheds\" move into the market. \"They have no staff with any expertise to warn people or advise them. A huge industry is growing up that needs codes of conduct.\" </p> <p>Gardening now, says John Turner, a Hampshire plantsman at Chelsea this week, is \"all style and no substance. People are spending fortunes on their gardens but are being ripped off rotten. Fancy architectural designers who don't have a clue how plants grow are telling them one thing, the public doesn't know where to get decent advice and nobody seems to know how to plant and nobody wants to maintain a garden. People are thinking plants are just another product. The whole idea that you must tend and care for them is going. I personally blame that Charlie Dimmock and all the makeover programmes. There are going to be a lot of disappointed people.\" </p> <p>Paul Evans, a broadcaster and former head of a major National Trust garden, says: \"The instant makeover garden has greater prestige today than the natural processes behind gardening. </p> <p>\"Gardening is being appropriated by stylists and big business. But what happens when the dog craps on the gravel or rats move in under the decking? Gardening always expresses the power shifts and obsessions of society. Right now it's going through a celebrity, instant gratification, technological stage. It's all based on very shallow, fleeting needs. But it will change again.\" </p> <p>This year, it seems everyone must have water, reflections and an animal - giant wild boar sculptures are popular - to signify the well-heeled gardener's ultimate taming of nature. It is, of course, all artifice. Behind the fa\u00e7ade of a lovingly recreated, early 20th-century brick outhouse (a snip at about \u00a375,000), high technology is working hard. That waterfall tumbling down a rainforest shipped in from Miami is plastic, that twinkling rock pool is made of ceramics and can be installed in a day. </p> <p>One garden stands out. By far the cheapest of the many exhibits on show (about \u00a310,000), it is a recreation of a small Forest of Dean family coal mine. With its home-made winding gear, a rotting old hut, bits of brick wall and a shaft entrance, it is called Time the Healer. Aptly, it has been designed and installed by prisoners from HM open prison Leyhill in Glouces-tershire, where gardening is now extraordinarily popular. It stands opposed to everything at Chelsea, an anti-garden full of dock leaves, cow parsley and wild flowers. Yet it is the most real and the closest to nature of all the Chelsea gardens. </p> <p>And whereas all the other exhibits and gardens will be sold off at the end of the week, possibly by internet auction, the Leyhill garden will not. \"There's nothing here that anyone wants really, is there?\" says one of the prison staff yesterday. \"I mean, who wants a lot of weeds?\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Here's how to spend a quater of a million quid or so on a garden. Call up Charles Funke Associates of Goldalming and ask for a \"garden of the night\" as commissioned by his highness, the Shaikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al-Nahyan for this year's Chelsea Flower Show. Very nice it is too, with its canopy, scented flowers, marble and lighting effects. Chelsea is also the place to be if you've only got \u00a325,000. For that you can buy a bronze of a bloke with a limp willy and a sick-looking cat on his shoulders. It's also where you will find a garden to represent (in the words of its designers) \"an allegorical journey from beginning to a higher goal representing someone embarking upon a new business venture with the scenes of mentoring and guiding, risk-taking innovation and energy\". Or a garden \"symbolising the chaotic activity of the heart following a cardiac arrest\". Pillars of rose quartz, instant labyrinth, rain forests, alpine pastures and even a Zen-inspired, dot.com-sponsored garden \"with an English twist\". Such is Chelsea and the British garden industry today: art and artifice, illusion and fantasy combined with the terrific skill of the world's greatest horticulturists. Or the most preposterous show on earth brought to you by stylists, makeover artists, designers, horticultural snobs and corporations trying to flog instant tranquillity, fashion and effect to an ever-more pressed and grotesque society. Chelsea this year is noticeably different. Gone is the famous old marquee, redolent of garden parties and flower shows up and down the country. In its place are two massive white sheds - or pavilions, as Sir Simon Hornby, president of the Royal Horticultural Society, likes to call them. The old marquee, he says, was \"discoloured and full of timber poles\". \"You could be anywhere now,\" says Lucia, a designer/plants-woman surveying the site last week, and dodging the lorry-loads of ceramic waterfalls, woven hazel fences, Victorian lighting, obelisks, parasols, penstemons, petunias and 100,000 other blooms. \"It looks like a Channel tunnel terminal or factory outlet,\" she says. \"The RHS used to be a great institution. Now it's all whizz kids and computers, spotty faces running the show who haven't a clue about plants. But if that's the way it's going - and some would say bloody good riddance to the past - then so be it.\" It is the way it's going. Gardening is now one of the fastest growing leisure industries in Britain, an essentially middle-class occupation serviced by up to 60,000 people. It is growing at a rate of 20% a year and in 1999 the public is estimated to have spent almost \u00a33bn on plants, a further \u00a38bn on decking, irrigation systems, ponds, pesticides, conservatories and all the extras of modern gardening - as well as an astonishing \u00a380m on garden gnomes and their upper-class equivalent, statuary. Three in four of us - a higher percentage than any other industrialised country - have a garden or some sort of outdoor space, even if only a window sill. Two out of three people, say the pollsters, garden as a hobby, making it the most popular British pastime. One in four women are said to enjoy gardening more than sex. More of us visit garden centres now than all the National Trust properties and theme parks combined. Meanwhile, superstores such as B&amp;Q and Homebase are getting in on the act, spotting a whole new profit line. Walmart, the huge US retail group which owns Asda, is expected to move in shortly. Television can't get enough of it and the celebrities, the politicians and the wannabes will all be at Chelsea this week. \"Gardening used to be full of mystique and mystery,\" says Jennifer Adams, head of the Royal Parks and a leading horticulturist. In the old days, she says, gardeners used to look up plants in catalogues, order months in advance and exchange specimens. No more. What was once a close-knit world with little money to spend has turned into a consumer-led phenomenon and an industry that is increasingly hi-tech. It draws much more on high fashion, art and design than on the qualities of plants. We may be buying more flowers than ever to beautify our homes or workspaces, but Britain, which has an international reputation for the most knowledgeable horticulturists in the world, is training ever fewer people with practical knowledge of plants. A combination of the end of the apprentice schemes run by local authorities and education policies which have denied grants to people wanting to study in horticultural centres of excellence, means that we are churning out each year many hundreds of garden designers and managers with academic qualifications but few of them prepared to get their hands dirty. Most degree courses need little or no practical experience. The problem is partly perception and fashion. Gardening is no longer on school curricula. Careers officers don't promote it and horticulture has been linked closely with agriculture which is seen to be in perpetual crisis. \"People are getting horticultural degrees without knowing the difference between hebes and sedges,\" says Pete Weston, editor of Horticulture Week. \"Nobody is going to college to learn how to propagate plants.\" The situation is so bad that companies are looking abroad for trained horticulturists - in Germany, Australia and Czechoslovakia, says John Richardson, chairman of Johnsons of Whixley, Britain's largest nursery stock growers. \"The international perception is that England is the origin of gardening,\" he says, \"but I'm terrified for the future. We are losing the stock of people who really know about plants. People do not want dirty-handed jobs anymore. The quality and standard of people being trained has dropped badly.\" Brian Donohue, who is Labour MP for Cunninghame South, Ayrshire, and works with the parliamentary horticulture and gardening group, says consumers need more protection and the burgeoning industry must have higher standards as the giant \"sheds\" move into the market. \"They have no staff with any expertise to warn people or advise them. A huge industry is growing up that needs codes of conduct.\" Gardening now, says John Turner, a Hampshire plantsman at Chelsea this week, is \"all style and no substance. People are spending fortunes on their gardens but are being ripped off rotten. Fancy architectural designers who don't have a clue how plants grow are telling them one thing, the public doesn't know where to get decent advice and nobody seems to know how to plant and nobody wants to maintain a garden. People are thinking plants are just another product. The whole idea that you must tend and care for them is going. I personally blame that Charlie Dimmock and all the makeover programmes. There are going to be a lot of disappointed people.\" Paul Evans, a broadcaster and former head of a major National Trust garden, says: \"The instant makeover garden has greater prestige today than the natural processes behind gardening. \"Gardening is being appropriated by stylists and big business. But what happens when the dog craps on the gravel or rats move in under the decking? Gardening always expresses the power shifts and obsessions of society. Right now it's going through a celebrity, instant gratification, technological stage. It's all based on very shallow, fleeting needs. But it will change again.\" This year, it seems everyone must have water, reflections and an animal - giant wild boar sculptures are popular - to signify the well-heeled gardener's ultimate taming of nature. It is, of course, all artifice. Behind the fa\u00e7ade of a lovingly recreated, early 20th-century brick outhouse (a snip at about \u00a375,000), high technology is working hard. That waterfall tumbling down a rainforest shipped in from Miami is plastic, that twinkling rock pool is made of ceramics and can be installed in a day. One garden stands out. By far the cheapest of the many exhibits on show (about \u00a310,000), it is a recreation of a small Forest of Dean family coal mine. With its home-made winding gear, a rotting old hut, bits of brick wall and a shaft entrance, it is called Time the Healer. Aptly, it has been designed and installed by prisoners from HM open prison Leyhill in Glouces-tershire, where gardening is now extraordinarily popular. It stands opposed to everything at Chelsea, an anti-garden full of dock leaves, cow parsley and wild flowers. Yet it is the most real and the closest to nature of all the Chelsea gardens. And whereas all the other exhibits and gardens will be sold off at the end of the week, possibly by internet auction, the Leyhill garden will not. \"There's nothing here that anyone wants really, is there?\" says one of the prison staff yesterday. \"I mean, who wants a lot of weeds?\"",

He wants to win over the so-called grey vote, or pensioners, who are angry that the Labour government has only increased the basic pension in line with inflation, described by everyone as a miserly 75 pence. <p><b>What is a basic pension? </b><br> Not enough to live on, according to virtually everyone; there are millions of pensioners living in poverty. Pensions start at 60 for women and 65 for men. Single pensioners get \u00a367.50 and married couples \u00a3107.90 a week - up \u00a31.20 on last year. A bigger increase is forecast for next April - around \u00a32 for a single pensioner and \u00a33 for a couple. The final figure is expected to be based on September's retail price index. There is a safety net for the very poor: anyone who does not get income from another source like a private pensions gets a minimum of \u00a378.45, but this is still not enough by anyone's standard.</p> <p><b>Do other countries do a lot better or worse?</b><br> Most countries do not have basic pensions. If people fail to provide for themselves, there is social welfare. In the United States, for example, there is no basic pension. It is based entirely on the contributions you have made to social security. The average is around \u00a3125 a week, but millions of people get less. In Australia, the automatic basic state pension has been abolished, and you're only entitled to it if your private pension is not enough. </p> <p><b>If everyone agrees it's too little to live on, why not put pensions up a lot?</b><br> The country simply cannot afford it. People are living longer, the working population is shrinking. There are already 11m pensioners. There is just not enough money being paid into the national coffers to keep on increasing pensions. A lot of people have private pensions, incomes from savings or investments and so on, so paying big pensions to everyone is not the answer. </p> <p>Labour want to \"target\" benefits by giving heating allowances and free television licences. In the long run, the government wants the entire workforce to pay into private pension funds and not rely on the state to keep them in their old age. Eventually, it hopes only those unable to work, or very poor for other reasons, like long-term unemployment or low-paid jobs, will need top-up state pensions.</p> <p><b>So the welfare state is on its uppers? </b><br> Yes, well at least it's heading that way, but this is a very sensitive subject politically. The government temporarily has a lot of money in the coffers because the economy is doing well and people are paying lots of tax. The trouble is putting the pensions up means having to keep paying out forever. The trouble for politicians is that pensioners are becoming the largest group of voters. Make them very cross by appearing mean and losing the next election is a real possibility.</p> <p><b>So Mr Hague is making promises and grabbing the grey vote ? </b><br> So he hopes. Single pensioners would get \u00a35.50 a week extra, married couples \u00a37. Those over 75 would get \u00a37.50 and \u00a310. These would be paid for by abolishing the current winter fuel payment, free TV licences and Labour's New Deal for Lone Parents, which was designed to get them back to work. Mr Hague dismissed the first two measures as bureaucratic and the third as having zero impact on employment. He said these measures would restore dignity and respect for pensions.</p> <p><b>What do the other parties think? </b><br> Hague is being attacked from all sides for being opportunistic, fiddling his figures, jumping on bandwagons and generally acting like a politician. </p> <p>Social security secretary Alistair Darling argued that his plans would leave the oldest and poorest pensioners worse off. Pensioners on the Minimum Income Guarantee (\u00a378.45) with no second pension would lose the winter fuel payment and free TV licence, but get no benefit from increasing the basic state pension because income support is higher than the basic state pension. </p> <p>Liberal Democrat social security spokesman Steve Webb said: \"No one trusts the Tories on pensions. All but 70p of this money would have gone to pensioners anyway under existing plans.\" </p> <p><b>What do pensioners think?</b><br> Age Concern said the proposals would still leave pensioners \u00a315 a week short of the income needed to avoid poverty. A spokesman for the charity said: \"As we get closer to the general election, all the parties seem to be engaging in a bidding auction of money already in the pot. Age Concern has heard from hundreds of pensioners angry at this year's paltry 75p pension increase.\" </p> <p>Veteran pensions campaigner Jack Jones, 87, said: \"It is pensioners' own money transferred from one pocket to another. The Tories took away our link with earnings back in 1980 - that is what we want back.\" Mr Jones, a former trade union leader and chairman of the National Pensioners Convention, said the only policy vote winner would be an immediate restoration of the link with average earnings. </p> <p>He said if the link had never been taken away, the basic pension would now be over \u00a390 instead of \u00a367. This year's pension rise under Labour was \"derisory\". It had led to pensioners staying away in the recent local elections, letting the Tories back in many local authorities across the country.</p>",

The Tories took away our link with earnings back in 1980 - that is what we want back.\" Mr Jones, a former trade union leader and chairman of the National Pensioners Convention, said the only policy vote winner would be an immediate restoration of the link with average earnings. He said if the link had never been taken away, the basic pension would now be over \u00a390 instead of \u00a367. This year's pension rise under Labour was \"derisory\". It had led to pensioners staying away in the recent local elections, letting the Tories back in many local authorities across the country.",

Hardy, who worked in the purest of all mathematical fields, the theory of numbers, used to boast in his patrician way that nothing he did in mathematics would ever be useful. He must be turning in his grave at developments in the 'science of secrecy' over the last quarter of a century. Like so many other practices, it has been transformed into a species of applied mathematics by the digital computer, with Hardy's beloved prime numbers playing a leading role. How this came about is the subject of Simon Singh's The Code Book, a very readable and skilfully told history of cryptography. Singh's method is to attach the abstract ideas involved to someone who thought of them, failed to think of them, championed them, or suffered their consequences - this last allowing him to include Mary Queen of Scots, whose unfortunate contribution to the art of secrecy was to correspond with her conspirators using an insecure cipher.</p> <p>One of the earliest ciphers, familiar to anybody who played with codes as a child, is the Caesar shift, in which each letter of the alphabet is replaced by another a fixed number of places from it. The Caesar shift is an example of a monoalphabetic cipher, all of which, as Arab mathematicians demonstrated in the tenth century, are easily broken because letter frequencies are consistent across texts in a given language - the commonest letter in any such encryption of an English text will correspond to E. The way round this is to use a polyalphabetic cipher, which changes the encrypting alphabet, in a pre-assigned way, at each successive letter. Thus, the word ADA might be encrypted by changing the first A to E (Caesar shift of four places), the D to E (shift of one place), the second A to Z (reversal), and so on; the enciphering of ADA as EEZ hides the repetition of A and defeats attempts at letter frequency analysis. The technique, prefigured in Alberti's meditations on codes and formulated by several individuals in the Renaissance, is named after its 16th-century rediscoverer, Blaise de Vigen\u00e8re. For several centuries, the Vigen*re cipher gloried under the title of 'chiffre ind\u00e8chiffrable', only to fall in the middle of the 19th century to the efforts of a retired Prussian officer, Friedrich Kasiski, and, independently, to the English inventor Charles Babbage.</p> <p>The cipher's weak point, it turned out, was not its encoding strategy, but the length of the key (usually a single word or phrase) which has to be repeated many times until it covers the message if it's to designate an alphabet for each plaintext letter. Any repeat or duplication gives decrypters a toehold, and both Kasiski and Babbage exploited this to reduce the polyalphabetic coding to an interweaving of monoalphabetic ones, each of which could then be cracked by analysing the letter frequency. So why not use message-length keys consisting of passages from a pre-assigned book? Unfortunately, these introduce another kind of repetition - words such as 'and' occur many times - which again facilitates decipherment. Alternatively, one could use a long, random sequence of numbers as a fresh key - a 'session' key - for each new message. The resulting cipher, known as a 'one-time pad', is indeed unbreakable, but the problems of generating and securely distributing enough keys has restricted it to situations combining low use with the highest security, such as traffic on the White House-Kremlin hotline.</p> <p>Keys, then, rather than encryption algorithms, seem to lie at the heart of the science of secrecy, a principle, Singh reports, that was first explicitly stated as an axiom by the Dutch linguist and cryptographer August Kerckhoffs von Nieuwenhof in 1883. The fate of coding since then bears this out: each of the two major advances in its history this century - the cracking of the German Enigma code and the invention of public-key encryption - has turned on keys in some way or other.</p> <p>Suppose, instead of trying to jumble the messages in each session by means of a long, randomised key, one could send a short key allowing a message scrambled by a machine to be unscrambled. The process could be made to work by equipping both sender and receiver with identical machines and codebooks of keys, each good for one day, say. The sender would transmit a short (hence secure) key consisting of the particular setting of the machine the sender had used; the receiver could use this, along with the key for the day, to unscramble the message. Might not the result be as safe as a one-time-pad version of Vigen\u00e8re's cipher? Some such reasoning seems to have lain behind the construction of machines like the Enigma. Invented in 1919, and adopted by the German Armed Forces only when they learned (from a book written by Winston Churchill in 1923) that their existing codes had been known to the British for some time, the Enigma machine dominated Second World War cryptanalysis.</p> <p>The story of how the Enigma was eventually cracked by the combined forces of first the Polish and then British intelligence at Bletchley Park, with Alan Turing in the genius role, has been told many times. To make sense of how it was done, you need to analyse the Polish contribution and know the details of the machine's innards, of detachable rotors and plugboard settings, as well as its operating procedure. Singh requires all of forty pages, together with diagrams and comfortingly concrete anecdotes, to make the principles involved clear, so I won't try to summarise them here. Suffice it to say that the Poles got hold of an Enigma machine in the early days, and that the Germans blundered initially by allowing the session key to be duplicated at the beginning of transmissions. This gave the Poles an opening and enabled them to invent a kind of parallel computational device called a bombe, which could check tens of thousands of possible combinations and gave Turing and Co an invaluable leg-up.</p> <p>The Enigma was a response, using early 20th century technology, to the crucial role played by radio communications in world war one, and to the vulnerability of the messages so conveyed. The prodigious number of simple, repetitive computations required to crack the codes (not to mention the related but less well-known and even more difficult Lorenz cipher) led to the construction of the first programmable computer and signified, certainly in relation to the technology of encryption - and, indeed, to the very concept of a machine - the eclipse of the electro-mechanical era.</p> <p>The 1960s saw the application of computational methods to produce ever more uncrackable ciphers, and this success, together with a shift in demand, from keeping military secrets to securing commercial ones, brought home the truth of Kerckhoffs's axiom of the primacy of keys over codes. Banks, for example, needed to distribute keys, a separate one for each customer, but were trapped in the catch-22 situation of needing a secure channel by which to do this; couriers carrying them in briefcases chained to their wrists proved impractical for anything but a small number of transactions. How to distribute keys became a crucial issue. The solution to it - public-key cryptography - formulated by mathematicians in the mid-1970s, transformed the field of cryptography and delivered, in a neat, easily implementable package, the security of transaction on which the mass use of credit cards and the global operations of financial capitalism, from multinational trade and finance to internet shopping, now rest.</p> <p>Public-key cryptography appears to be a paradox. If keys aren't secret, what's the point of them? How can a cipher work to conceal a message if everybody has access to the information designed to encrypt it? The answer, pioneered by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman in the early 1970s, is to reject a principle of cryptography apparently so obvious as to go unchallenged until then: namely, that deciphering is the reverse of enciphering and that encryption and decryption keys are identical. Rejecting this principle makes it possible to think in terms of having two keys: a public one used to encrypt a message, and a private one, known only to the recipient, that she can use for decryption. For such an idea to work, encryption, being a public act, must be a one-way process, since being able to reverse it would allow a third party to retrieve the message, but it must also be such that what the recipient alone knows can circumvent this irreversibility.</p> <p>A computational process that could achieve this was invented by three mathematicians at MIT, Ronald Rivest, Adi Shamar and Leonard Adleman. Their solution, known after their initials as RSA cryptography and used now in millions of transactions daily, is built from a pair of one-way mathematical functions. The first of these is multiplication: it takes only a second or so for a computer to multiply two very large prime numbers together and arrive at their product N, but it can take billions of times longer to reverse the process and find the two factors of N. The second function is (a modular form of) exponentiation, i.e., the raising of one number to the power of another, a process which once again covers its own tracks just as multiplication does.</p> <p>The RSA system is a public algorithm, essentially a formula based on the functions into which numbers can be slotted. If Alice wants to receive a message from Bob, she chooses two very large prime numbers, p and q, and posts their product N as her public key, along with a small number e that is needed to make the formula work; her private key is her knowledge of p and q. Bob inputs the number M he wishes to encrypt, along with N and e, and sends the result to Alice. The system is so constructed that only Alice, who knows p and q, can use the number sent to her to reconstitute M. The entire procedure has to be reversed - Bob must now choose his own p and q and post their product - when Alice sends him a message.

Hardy, who worked in the purest of all mathematical fields, the theory of numbers, used to boast in his patrician way that nothing he did in mathematics would ever be useful. He must be turning in his grave at developments in the 'science of secrecy' over the last quarter of a century. Like so many other practices, it has been transformed into a species of applied mathematics by the digital computer, with Hardy's beloved prime numbers playing a leading role. How this came about is the subject of Simon Singh's The Code Book, a very readable and skilfully told history of cryptography. Singh's method is to attach the abstract ideas involved to someone who thought of them, failed to think of them, championed them, or suffered their consequences - this last allowing him to include Mary Queen of Scots, whose unfortunate contribution to the art of secrecy was to correspond with her conspirators using an insecure cipher. One of the earliest ciphers, familiar to anybody who played with codes as a child, is the Caesar shift, in which each letter of the alphabet is replaced by another a fixed number of places from it. The Caesar shift is an example of a monoalphabetic cipher, all of which, as Arab mathematicians demonstrated in the tenth century, are easily broken because letter frequencies are consistent across texts in a given language - the commonest letter in any such encryption of an English text will correspond to E. The way round this is to use a polyalphabetic cipher, which changes the encrypting alphabet, in a pre-assigned way, at each successive letter. Thus, the word ADA might be encrypted by changing the first A to E (Caesar shift of four places), the D to E (shift of one place), the second A to Z (reversal), and so on; the enciphering of ADA as EEZ hides the repetition of A and defeats attempts at letter frequency analysis. The technique, prefigured in Alberti's meditations on codes and formulated by several individuals in the Renaissance, is named after its 16th-century rediscoverer, Blaise de Vigen\u00e8re. For several centuries, the Vigen*re cipher gloried under the title of 'chiffre ind\u00e8chiffrable', only to fall in the middle of the 19th century to the efforts of a retired Prussian officer, Friedrich Kasiski, and, independently, to the English inventor Charles Babbage. The cipher's weak point, it turned out, was not its encoding strategy, but the length of the key (usually a single word or phrase) which has to be repeated many times until it covers the message if it's to designate an alphabet for each plaintext letter. Any repeat or duplication gives decrypters a toehold, and both Kasiski and Babbage exploited this to reduce the polyalphabetic coding to an interweaving of monoalphabetic ones, each of which could then be cracked by analysing the letter frequency. So why not use message-length keys consisting of passages from a pre-assigned book? Unfortunately, these introduce another kind of repetition - words such as 'and' occur many times - which again facilitates decipherment. Alternatively, one could use a long, random sequence of numbers as a fresh key - a 'session' key - for each new message. The resulting cipher, known as a 'one-time pad', is indeed unbreakable, but the problems of generating and securely distributing enough keys has restricted it to situations combining low use with the highest security, such as traffic on the White House-Kremlin hotline. Keys, then, rather than encryption algorithms, seem to lie at the heart of the science of secrecy, a principle, Singh reports, that was first explicitly stated as an axiom by the Dutch linguist and cryptographer August Kerckhoffs von Nieuwenhof in 1883. The fate of coding since then bears this out: each of the two major advances in its history this century - the cracking of the German Enigma code and the invention of public-key encryption - has turned on keys in some way or other. Suppose, instead of trying to jumble the messages in each session by means of a long, randomised key, one could send a short key allowing a message scrambled by a machine to be unscrambled. The process could be made to work by equipping both sender and receiver with identical machines and codebooks of keys, each good for one day, say. The sender would transmit a short (hence secure) key consisting of the particular setting of the machine the sender had used; the receiver could use this, along with the key for the day, to unscramble the message. Might not the result be as safe as a one-time-pad version of Vigen\u00e8re's cipher? Some such reasoning seems to have lain behind the construction of machines like the Enigma. Invented in 1919, and adopted by the German Armed Forces only when they learned (from a book written by Winston Churchill in 1923) that their existing codes had been known to the British for some time, the Enigma machine dominated Second World War cryptanalysis. The story of how the Enigma was eventually cracked by the combined forces of first the Polish and then British intelligence at Bletchley Park, with Alan Turing in the genius role, has been told many times. To make sense of how it was done, you need to analyse the Polish contribution and know the details of the machine's innards, of detachable rotors and plugboard settings, as well as its operating procedure. Singh requires all of forty pages, together with diagrams and comfortingly concrete anecdotes, to make the principles involved clear, so I won't try to summarise them here. Suffice it to say that the Poles got hold of an Enigma machine in the early days, and that the Germans blundered initially by allowing the session key to be duplicated at the beginning of transmissions. This gave the Poles an opening and enabled them to invent a kind of parallel computational device called a bombe, which could check tens of thousands of possible combinations and gave Turing and Co an invaluable leg-up. The Enigma was a response, using early 20th century technology, to the crucial role played by radio communications in world war one, and to the vulnerability of the messages so conveyed. The prodigious number of simple, repetitive computations required to crack the codes (not to mention the related but less well-known and even more difficult Lorenz cipher) led to the construction of the first programmable computer and signified, certainly in relation to the technology of encryption - and, indeed, to the very concept of a machine - the eclipse of the electro-mechanical era. The 1960s saw the application of computational methods to produce ever more uncrackable ciphers, and this success, together with a shift in demand, from keeping military secrets to securing commercial ones, brought home the truth of Kerckhoffs's axiom of the primacy of keys over codes. Banks, for example, needed to distribute keys, a separate one for each customer, but were trapped in the catch-22 situation of needing a secure channel by which to do this; couriers carrying them in briefcases chained to their wrists proved impractical for anything but a small number of transactions. How to distribute keys became a crucial issue. The solution to it - public-key cryptography - formulated by mathematicians in the mid-1970s, transformed the field of cryptography and delivered, in a neat, easily implementable package, the security of transaction on which the mass use of credit cards and the global operations of financial capitalism, from multinational trade and finance to internet shopping, now rest. Public-key cryptography appears to be a paradox. If keys aren't secret, what's the point of them? How can a cipher work to conceal a message if everybody has access to the information designed to encrypt it? The answer, pioneered by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman in the early 1970s, is to reject a principle of cryptography apparently so obvious as to go unchallenged until then: namely, that deciphering is the reverse of enciphering and that encryption and decryption keys are identical. Rejecting this principle makes it possible to think in terms of having two keys: a public one used to encrypt a message, and a private one, known only to the recipient, that she can use for decryption. For such an idea to work, encryption, being a public act, must be a one-way process, since being able to reverse it would allow a third party to retrieve the message, but it must also be such that what the recipient alone knows can circumvent this irreversibility. A computational process that could achieve this was invented by three mathematicians at MIT, Ronald Rivest, Adi Shamar and Leonard Adleman. Their solution, known after their initials as RSA cryptography and used now in millions of transactions daily, is built from a pair of one-way mathematical functions. The first of these is multiplication: it takes only a second or so for a computer to multiply two very large prime numbers together and arrive at their product N, but it can take billions of times longer to reverse the process and find the two factors of N. The second function is (a modular form of) exponentiation, i.e., the raising of one number to the power of another, a process which once again covers its own tracks just as multiplication does. The RSA system is a public algorithm, essentially a formula based on the functions into which numbers can be slotted. If Alice wants to receive a message from Bob, she chooses two very large prime numbers, p and q, and posts their product N as her public key, along with a small number e that is needed to make the formula work; her private key is her knowledge of p and q. Bob inputs the number M he wishes to encrypt, along with N and e, and sends the result to Alice. The system is so constructed that only Alice, who knows p and q, can use the number sent to her to reconstitute M. The entire procedure has to be reversed - Bob must now choose his own p and q and post their product - when Alice sends him a message. Encrypting only numbers is not in fact a restriction on communication, since any message composed of letters can be converted via ASCII characters into a unique number. There is no guarantee that such a system is foolproof: it's the size of the number N and the time it takes computers to factorise it that make messages secure. Advances in number theory and an increase in computing power could weaken the system. Indeed, a group of researchers in Amsterdam, working over a six-week period last summer, cracked a medium-hard version of the RSA system by harnessing a supercomputer to hundreds of PCs. Also, neither the irreversible functions nor the RSA formula incorporating them are unique: there are other one-way mathematical functions and no doubt other algorithms.

      "body": "<p>Pensioner groups and poverty lobbyists fell upon William Hague's new pension proposals with almost as much fury yesterday as government ministers - and rather loftier motives.</p> <p>Social security expert and Labour ex-minister, Frank Field, counter-intuitive as ever, jumped the other way and backed Mr Hague. ''It's not the Tories, it's the pensioners that are de-stablising this government,'' he predicted. It was another lively day for ''grey power.''</p> <p>The Conservative leader used a speech in London to fuel pensioner suspicions that they are not important in the Blairite ''young country'' scheme of things. He also promised to re-allocate some of Labour's pension schemes, notably the \u00a3150 a year winter fuel allowance and the free TV licence for over-75s.</p> <p>Both are tax-free and go to dukes as well as retired dustmen. Under Mr Hague's \u00a32 billion scheme the money would be re-allocated on the basic pension ( taxable) at between \u00a35 a week for the single pensioner aged 65-75 and \u00a310 pw for pensioner couples over 75, of whom relatively few survive as couples. Men still die younger.</p> <p>Government statisticians fell on the Hague plan to prove that, once assorted benefits have been clawed back - or tax paid in some cases - many of the poorest pensioners will either be 30p better off or (said Liberal Democrat MP and tax expert, Professor Steve Webb) 66p worse off, if they pay tax.</p> <p>The government has been on the backfoot over pensions since April when Britain's 10 million pensioners received an inflation-proofed 75p a week extra in their pension books - courtesy of the chancellor, Gordon Brown.</p> <p>Mr Brown is determined to concentrate his efforts to help those pensioners who are poorest, usually the very old. Had he taken his critics advice and re-linked pensions to average earnings not inflation, he says, he would have spent \u00a3600m less on pensioners than his own mix of measures is giving them.</p> <p>''The dishonesty of these Tory proposals is breathtaking,'' he said in a statement. the social security secretary, Alistair Darling, was even more scathing. The poorest will be poorer still, he predicted.</p> <p>The Tory spokesman, ex-Treasury official David ''Two Brains'' Willetts, as expert in his way as his rivals, disagrees. These are his considered plans, not the quickie response that Labour claims they are. But the Tory leader and his staff have spotted a rich seam of discontent. Pensioner lobbies and other s have long complained that the basic state pension is becoming a safety net, withering away as average wages rise much faster than inflation and occupational pensions make the majority better off - in some cases spectacularly so.</p> <p>Some pensioners want more money on the basic rate as a matter of principle, they are old enough to be sensitive to any talk of ''handouts'' - and feel they have worked and paid all their lives for a pension that keeps them out of poverty.</p> <p>They mistrust one-off payments like the fuel allowance, which could be withdrawn. They resent means-tested benefits, increasingly the government's policy -''targeting'' help on the most needy - and want the political solidarity which goes with a universally payable pension benefit.</p> <p>The trouble is with such payments - including child benefit at the other end of the scale - is that they are costly and they give money to dukes who may not need it, as well as many comfortably-off middle c lass pensioners.</p> <p>It is hard to get the mix right, but one thing remains certain. Pensioners remember to vote better than young people. They also remember slights. No wonder Mr Brown is jumpy.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Pensioner groups and poverty lobbyists fell upon William Hague's new pension proposals with almost as much fury yesterday as government ministers - and rather loftier motives. Social security expert and Labour ex-minister, Frank Field, counter-intuitive as ever, jumped the other way and backed Mr Hague. ''It's not the Tories, it's the pensioners that are de-stablising this government,'' he predicted. It was another lively day for ''grey power.'' The Conservative leader used a speech in London to fuel pensioner suspicions that they are not important in the Blairite ''young country'' scheme of things. He also promised to re-allocate some of Labour's pension schemes, notably the \u00a3150 a year winter fuel allowance and the free TV licence for over-75s. Both are tax-free and go to dukes as well as retired dustmen. Under Mr Hague's \u00a32 billion scheme the money would be re-allocated on the basic pension ( taxable) at between \u00a35 a week for the single pensioner aged 65-75 and \u00a310 pw for pensioner couples over 75, of whom relatively few survive as couples. Men still die younger. Government statisticians fell on the Hague plan to prove that, once assorted benefits have been clawed back - or tax paid in some cases - many of the poorest pensioners will either be 30p better off or (said Liberal Democrat MP and tax expert, Professor Steve Webb) 66p worse off, if they pay tax. The government has been on the backfoot over pensions since April when Britain's 10 million pensioners received an inflation-proofed 75p a week extra in their pension books - courtesy of the chancellor, Gordon Brown. Mr Brown is determined to concentrate his efforts to help those pensioners who are poorest, usually the very old. Had he taken his critics advice and re-linked pensions to average earnings not inflation, he says, he would have spent \u00a3600m less on pensioners than his own mix of measures is giving them. ''The dishonesty of these Tory proposals is breathtaking,'' he said in a statement. the social security secretary, Alistair Darling, was even more scathing. The poorest will be poorer still, he predicted. The Tory spokesman, ex-Treasury official David ''Two Brains'' Willetts, as expert in his way as his rivals, disagrees. These are his considered plans, not the quickie response that Labour claims they are. But the Tory leader and his staff have spotted a rich seam of discontent. Pensioner lobbies and other s have long complained that the basic state pension is becoming a safety net, withering away as average wages rise much faster than inflation and occupational pensions make the majority better off - in some cases spectacularly so. Some pensioners want more money on the basic rate as a matter of principle, they are old enough to be sensitive to any talk of ''handouts'' - and feel they have worked and paid all their lives for a pension that keeps them out of poverty. They mistrust one-off payments like the fuel allowance, which could be withdrawn. They resent means-tested benefits, increasingly the government's policy -''targeting'' help on the most needy - and want the political solidarity which goes with a universally payable pension benefit. The trouble is with such payments - including child benefit at the other end of the scale - is that they are costly and they give money to dukes who may not need it, as well as many comfortably-off middle c lass pensioners. It is hard to get the mix right, but one thing remains certain. Pensioners remember to vote better than young people. They also remember slights. No wonder Mr Brown is jumpy.",

      "body": "<p>A few weeks ago the Evening Standard published a story under the headline 'Trendy oldies join Cool Britannia'. It read: 'Ministers want to \"rebrand\" pensioners with a trendy name that will appeal to younger people. Some of Whitehall's finest minds are working on the problem, while the Government is also seeking outside help to try to come up with the new title\u0085 Ministers believe words like \"pensioners\" or \"elderly\" carry a grey image with deters young people from thinking ahead' (29th March 2000).</p> <p>That story sums up this Government's attitude towards Britain's pensioners.</p> <p>It sums up the attitude of Tony Blair when he talks about Britain becoming a 'young country' and has no time for those forces of conservatism who don't fit in it.</p> <p>It sums up the attitude of Peter Mandelson, the man in charge of Labour's election plans, who says there is 'no mileage' in targeting elderly voters because they are not 'aspirational' (Sunday Times, 16 April 2000).</p> <p>It sums up the attitude of the Chairman of the Labour Parliamentary Party, who recently came out with the breathtaking insult that pensioners are often 'racist'. Of course he also said they were 'predominantly Conservative' (Sunday Times, 16 April 2000) and we intend to prove him right at least about that.</p> <p>It sums up the attitude of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who has patronised older people by trying to buy them off with a series of badly targeted, bureaucratic gimmicks and then was only able to offer them a 75 pence increase in the basic state pension.</p> <p>Britain's eleven million pensioners know that they are the unwanted, unwelcome, uncool guests at New Labour's banquet. And they know that they have paid the price through their pockets.</p> <p>For three years pensioners have been at the sharp end of the Chancellor's policies.</p> <p>At the sharp end of \u00a3150 average rises in Council Tax for Band D properties as Labour Councils and a Labour Government worked together to waste their money. The Government talks of a \u00a3150 winter fuel payment. Many pensioners have found that by the time they've paid their increased Council Tax the money has all gone.</p> <p>At the sharp end of increases in petrol prices. Pensioners who depend on their cars to preserve their independence have seen prices driven close to the \u00a34 a gallon mark.</p> <p>At the sharp end too, when this Chancellor scrapped dividend tax credits, leaving 300,000 pensioners whose income is below the income tax threshold, having to pay an average of \u00a375 a year more to the exchequer.</p> <p>In the same \u00a35bn a year raid on pension funds, Gordon Brown set a timebomb for future pensioners by forcing working people to put up to \u00a3200 a year extra into their pension funds. Last year he abolished the Married Couples Allowance for all future pensioners too.</p> <p>He has also scrapped the Widows Bereavement Allowance without compensating all widowed pensioners properly, scrapped tax relief on medical insurance for the over 65s and abolished retirement relief for older people selling off their small businesses.</p> <p>Pensioners remembered all these blows when they reacted so angrily to the 75p basic rate rise.</p> <p>Gordon Brown hoped no one would notice. He hoped the anger of pensioners wouldn't matter. How wrong he was.</p> <p>As anyone who campaigned in this year's local elections, who knocked on doors and listened to hard pressed pensioners, knows: boy, did they notice, and boy, are they angry.</p> <p>Angry at a Labour Government that promised to be the pensioners' friend and has comprehensively betrayed them.</p> <p>Angry at a Labour Government that used every low-down trick to win pensioners' votes at the general election and then forgot all about them the day after.</p> <p>Angry at a Labour Government that has produced one gimmick after another, but doesn't trust pensioners with a decent weekly income they can spend as they see fit.</p> <p>I have listened to their anger and their feelings of betrayal first-hand in hundreds of meetings around Britain.</p> <p>I listened to the elderly man in Bolton who told me 'Labour's priorities are all wrong - look at Europe, the Dome, these asylum seekers - more should be done on health and for the pensioners'.</p> <p>I listened to the lifelong Labour supporter in Plymouth who summed up what she thought of Tony Blair and his policies: 'He thinks people like me are old has-beens, who aren't important or glamorous, people who they think can simply go to the back of the queue'.</p> <p>I listened to the pensioner in Leeds who could barely contain his anger when he said to me '75p was a joke, an insult \u0085 We don't want all these gestures and gimmicks - we just want a decent basic pension'.</p> <p>And I listened also to another pensioner here in London who had a message for Conservatives. 'I voted Labour because they promised so much. I'm terribly disappointed but I wonder if there is any alternative'.</p> <p>We've been busy listening to people while this Government has been busy forgetting them.</p> <p>Now we are offering an alternative. Our Party has listened to all these people, and in all sorts of areas we are now offering an alternative to the failed polices and broken promises of this Government.</p> <p>We offer a law and order policy that will back up the police, punish the criminal, and protect those, such as the elderly, who are particularly vulnerable to crime.</p> <p>We offer a health policy that will build a stronger NHS that puts patients before politicians, and which doesn't treat older people as second class patients.</p> <p>We offer a long term care policy that protects the assets of responsible people who save for their retirement.</p> <p>Today, I want to build on those policies by tackling the central concern of millions of pensioners: the level of their weekly income and the basic state pension.</p> <p>What pensioners say over and over again is that they would rather have a reliable weekly income which is theirs by right to spend as they think best, than a series of handouts and gimmicks.</p> <p>Today we are setting out a carefully costed package based on a Conservative pension uprating in April 2001. It shows what we would do for pensioners in hard figures and in hard cash. We are calling it Common Sense for Pensioners.</p> <p>We would start by putting the money used on the winter fuel payment and the free TV licence into the basic pension instead. This also brings a bureaucracy bonus as we can save \u00a340 million currently being wasted on administering, often very incompetently, these new schemes. Many pensioners received their winter fuel payments as winter drew to a close. We're going to take that \u00a340 million out of the budgets of bureaucrats and put it directly into the pockets of pensioners.</p> <p>We have also identified extra social security savings. We would abolish the New Deal for Lone Parents which is a \u00a390 million a year flop. On the Government's own figures, it is having zero impact on the employment prospects of lone parents. We have already announced separately our far more effective approach to lone parents. We would also recoup some money from the Social Fund, which has recently been increased substantially by the Government.</p> <p>Taken together, these measures yield almost exactly \u00a32 billion. We would then put all this money into helping pensioners in the most straight-forward, honest, and effective way - increases in the basic contributory state pension. We would add it to the expected increase in next year's pension uprating which, if awarded on the basis of current inflation forecasts, would be \u00a32 to a single pensioner and \u00a33 for a married couple.</p> <p>On this basis, if the normal uprating followed inflation, the Conservative uprating in April 2001would be:</p> <p>\u0095 \u00a35.50 extra (\u00a373 a week) for a single pensioner aged under 75. <br> \u0095 \u00a37 extra (114.90 a week) for a pensioner couple aged under 75. <br> \u0095 \u00a37.50 (\u00a375.25 a week) for a single pensioner aged 75 or over. <br> \u0095 \u00a310 (\u00a3118.15 a week) for a pensioner couple aged 75 or over.</p> <p>We would also adjust tax allowances for older people to compensate pensioners for any extra that they might otherwise pay. And we would adjust means tested benefits to ensure that the poorest pensioners gain at least as much as other pensioners. I heard the Social Security Secretary on the radio this morning claiming that the poorest pensioners would lose out from our proposals. So let me make it absolutely clear that these increases will go to all pensioners, including those on means tested benefits. All pensioners will be entitled to these increases.</p> <p>These, then, are big increases in the basic state pension.</p> <p>In the main, we achieve these increases by consolidating all of the gimmicks into something which pensioners would far prefer - reliable increases in their weekly income. In other words, no more gimmicks means more on the basic pension.</p> <p>But on top of that we are also adding the \u00a340 million bureaucracy bonus, as well as adding money found elsewhere in the social security budget. In total, this amounts to \u00a3320 million of new money for pensioners. Our increase in basic state pension will leave all pensioners better off with the Conservatives than under Labour.</p> <p>And to make sure pensioners can rely on it and that they will know that this is a promise that will be delivered, these increases in the basic state pension would be financed out of National Insurance. It would be a return on all those contributions pensioners have made through their working lives.</p> <p>This reform means dignity and choice and respect for pensioners. It means a larger state pension as an entitlement rather than making pensioners depend on occasional handouts from Government.</p> <p>By turning the handouts into entitlements, into a proper return on national insurance contributions, and by adding in the extra savings, all pensioners will be better off with the Conservatives. In other words, Common Sense for Pensioners means we are offering a real improvement in the income of all pensioners.</p> <p>Unlike the Labour Party, I am not going to make exaggerated promises that unrealistically raise people's expectations only to shatter them later. I know that many pensioners find it difficult to make ends meet. I don't pretend that an extra \u00a310 a week will solve all the problems of pensioners.</p> <p>Let me tell you what I do promise.</p> <p>First, Common Sense for Pensioners means dignity and respect for pensioners.</p> <p>It rightly angers pensioners, who have paid national insurance contributions their entire lives, to have the government announce payments on budget day as if they were the charitable act of a merciful Chancellor. The basic state pension is not charity, it is a return on years of payments. Understanding this and reflecting this in pension policy is a matter of respect for pensioners. My Party is determined to show that respect.</p> <p>Quite apart from the fact that the Chancellor's measures restrict pensioner choice and personal independence they are also patronising. They assume the Government knows better than pensioners how to budget for periods of greater expense and shouldn't give pensioners money until the Government thinks they should spend it. This patronising attitude, too, shows little respect and is accordingly resented.</p> <p>Second, our policy simplifies a key part of the benefits system. This is true to another Tory principle that deplores government waste and inefficiency. Gordon Brown has deliberately made both our tax and benefits system more complicated. He prefers to act by stealth. In this way he is undermining confidence in politics and Government. With our reform pensioners will know exactly what they are getting and how much it is worth. That really is common sense.</p> <p>But let me deal here in advance with some of the slurs and attacks which I expect from our political opponents.</p> <p>Labour will claim that their policies are targeted on poorer pensioners, whereas we offer across the board increases. That is rubbish. Many of their schemes have been indiscriminate. The winter fuel payment goes to the 220,000 more affluent pensioners in residential accommodation or nursing homes who do not claim Income Support; but the payment is not available for the 280,000 in such accommodation who do claim Income Support. In other words better off pensioners get it and worse off ones don't.</p> <p>What we are proposing is better targeted than Labour's measures. We guarantee that this increase in the basic pension will reach all pensioners including those on means-tested benefits, so that poorer pensioners getting at least as much from the package as others. Moreover, we know that poorer pensioners tend to be older and we have therefore put extra money particularly towards pensioners aged over 75.</p> <p>Labour will also try to scare pensioners by claiming that the Tories are simply abolishing the winter fuel payment and the free TV licence.</p> <p>To save them the effort, let me remind the Millbank spindoctors now of what their own former Minister, Peter Kilfoyle, says: 'pensioners believe that winter fuel payments and concessionary television licences are a diversionary measure \u0085 What pensioners want is an increase, week on week, in the basic pension. This is not just a matter of economics: it is a question too of pensioners' dignity' (Hansard, 27th March 2000).</p> <p>The dignity of pensioners is what our package is all about. The key fact, that no amount of Labour lies can obscure, is that all pensioners, regardless of which gimmicks they currently receive, will be better off.</p> <p>There will be others who say that our policy is no substitute for far-reaching welfare reform. I completely agree. This is not our last word on pensions policy. It is the beginning of presenting our vision for the future, one in which more and more pensioners enjoy rising living standards as a result of the savings and the funded pensions they have built up during their working lives.</p> <p>We want to ensure that pensioners participate in the rising living standards of the country as a whole. We will be setting out further proposals to spread funded pensions still more widely to the next generation of pensioners.</p> <p>But that is a policy for people of working age who have yet to become pensioners. It is too late for current pensioners. Many of the pensioners who are managing on such modest incomes retired without any entitlement to a funded pension. However strongly we push forward better funded pensions for the next generation, we still have a debt to the current generation of pensioners. That is what today's package is all about.</p> <p>It gives pensioners a real choice, a choice which gets to the heart of the difference between our two parties.</p> <p>They can choose New Labour's way. The way that treats pensioners as unfortunate misfits in their dreams of Cool Britannia. The way that patronises pensioners with handouts and treats them almost like charity cases.</p> <p>Or they can vote for a genuine Conservative alternative, from a Party which has been listening - a reliable guaranteed increase in the contributory basic state pension.</p> <p>It is quite simply a choice between being treated with contempt or being treated with respect.</p> <p>Today's pensioners have contributed so much to building Britain into the great nation it is today. They have served in our armed forces and fought to keep our nation free; they have worked in our country's businesses and built up its economy; and have they raised our generation and bequeathed us a Britain that begins this new century free and proud and prosperous.</p> <p>Yet despite all they've done their contribution isn't in the past. They are part of our nation's future too. For they are among our most active citizens. Among the most important contributors to voluntary organisations. Among the most important supports for family life. They support much which this country depends on.</p> <p>Today's pensioners do not want sops or charity. They want to feel that they are getting benefits to which they have all their lives contributing to. They want the independence and respect that they have every right to deserve.</p> <p>This year, the Conservative Party has been speaking for the great mainstream majority of the British people on crime, on asylum seekers, on tax and on Europe. That is why we won the local elections so convincingly.</p> <p>Now we are moving on to new areas - areas which Labour have for too long regarded as their own. Today we are speaking for the great mainstream majority of pensioners who feel betrayed and neglected by this Government; today we offer substantial increases in the basic pension instead of gimmicks; today we offer a bold, common sense policy for pensioners.</p>",

Some of Whitehall's finest minds are working on the problem, while the Government is also seeking outside help to try to come up with the new title\u0085 Ministers believe words like \"pensioners\" or \"elderly\" carry a grey image with deters young people from thinking ahead' (29th March 2000). That story sums up this Government's attitude towards Britain's pensioners. It sums up the attitude of Tony Blair when he talks about Britain becoming a 'young country' and has no time for those forces of conservatism who don't fit in it. It sums up the attitude of Peter Mandelson, the man in charge of Labour's election plans, who says there is 'no mileage' in targeting elderly voters because they are not 'aspirational' (Sunday Times, 16 April 2000). It sums up the attitude of the Chairman of the Labour Parliamentary Party, who recently came out with the breathtaking insult that pensioners are often 'racist'. Of course he also said they were 'predominantly Conservative' (Sunday Times, 16 April 2000) and we intend to prove him right at least about that. It sums up the attitude of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who has patronised older people by trying to buy them off with a series of badly targeted, bureaucratic gimmicks and then was only able to offer them a 75 pence increase in the basic state pension. Britain's eleven million pensioners know that they are the unwanted, unwelcome, uncool guests at New Labour's banquet. And they know that they have paid the price through their pockets. For three years pensioners have been at the sharp end of the Chancellor's policies. At the sharp end of \u00a3150 average rises in Council Tax for Band D properties as Labour Councils and a Labour Government worked together to waste their money. The Government talks of a \u00a3150 winter fuel payment. Many pensioners have found that by the time they've paid their increased Council Tax the money has all gone. At the sharp end of increases in petrol prices. Pensioners who depend on their cars to preserve their independence have seen prices driven close to the \u00a34 a gallon mark. At the sharp end too, when this Chancellor scrapped dividend tax credits, leaving 300,000 pensioners whose income is below the income tax threshold, having to pay an average of \u00a375 a year more to the exchequer. In the same \u00a35bn a year raid on pension funds, Gordon Brown set a timebomb for future pensioners by forcing working people to put up to \u00a3200 a year extra into their pension funds. Last year he abolished the Married Couples Allowance for all future pensioners too. He has also scrapped the Widows Bereavement Allowance without compensating all widowed pensioners properly, scrapped tax relief on medical insurance for the over 65s and abolished retirement relief for older people selling off their small businesses. Pensioners remembered all these blows when they reacted so angrily to the 75p basic rate rise. Gordon Brown hoped no one would notice. He hoped the anger of pensioners wouldn't matter. How wrong he was. As anyone who campaigned in this year's local elections, who knocked on doors and listened to hard pressed pensioners, knows: boy, did they notice, and boy, are they angry. Angry at a Labour Government that promised to be the pensioners' friend and has comprehensively betrayed them. Angry at a Labour Government that used every low-down trick to win pensioners' votes at the general election and then forgot all about them the day after. Angry at a Labour Government that has produced one gimmick after another, but doesn't trust pensioners with a decent weekly income they can spend as they see fit. I have listened to their anger and their feelings of betrayal first-hand in hundreds of meetings around Britain. I listened to the elderly man in Bolton who told me 'Labour's priorities are all wrong - look at Europe, the Dome, these asylum seekers - more should be done on health and for the pensioners'. I listened to the lifelong Labour supporter in Plymouth who summed up what she thought of Tony Blair and his policies: 'He thinks people like me are old has-beens, who aren't important or glamorous, people who they think can simply go to the back of the queue'. I listened to the pensioner in Leeds who could barely contain his anger when he said to me '75p was a joke, an insult \u0085 We don't want all these gestures and gimmicks - we just want a decent basic pension'. And I listened also to another pensioner here in London who had a message for Conservatives. 'I voted Labour because they promised so much. I'm terribly disappointed but I wonder if there is any alternative'. We've been busy listening to people while this Government has been busy forgetting them. Now we are offering an alternative. Our Party has listened to all these people, and in all sorts of areas we are now offering an alternative to the failed polices and broken promises of this Government. We offer a law and order policy that will back up the police, punish the criminal, and protect those, such as the elderly, who are particularly vulnerable to crime. We offer a health policy that will build a stronger NHS that puts patients before politicians, and which doesn't treat older people as second class patients. We offer a long term care policy that protects the assets of responsible people who save for their retirement. Today, I want to build on those policies by tackling the central concern of millions of pensioners: the level of their weekly income and the basic state pension. What pensioners say over and over again is that they would rather have a reliable weekly income which is theirs by right to spend as they think best, than a series of handouts and gimmicks. Today we are setting out a carefully costed package based on a Conservative pension uprating in April 2001. It shows what we would do for pensioners in hard figures and in hard cash. We are calling it Common Sense for Pensioners. We would start by putting the money used on the winter fuel payment and the free TV licence into the basic pension instead. This also brings a bureaucracy bonus as we can save \u00a340 million currently being wasted on administering, often very incompetently, these new schemes. Many pensioners received their winter fuel payments as winter drew to a close. We're going to take that \u00a340 million out of the budgets of bureaucrats and put it directly into the pockets of pensioners. We have also identified extra social security savings. We would abolish the New Deal for Lone Parents which is a \u00a390 million a year flop. On the Government's own figures, it is having zero impact on the employment prospects of lone parents. We have already announced separately our far more effective approach to lone parents. We would also recoup some money from the Social Fund, which has recently been increased substantially by the Government. Taken together, these measures yield almost exactly \u00a32 billion. We would then put all this money into helping pensioners in the most straight-forward, honest, and effective way - increases in the basic contributory state pension. We would add it to the expected increase in next year's pension uprating which, if awarded on the basis of current inflation forecasts, would be \u00a32 to a single pensioner and \u00a33 for a married couple. On this basis, if the normal uprating followed inflation, the Conservative uprating in April 2001would be: \u0095 \u00a35.50 extra (\u00a373 a week) for a single pensioner aged under 75. \u0095 \u00a37 extra (114.90 a week) for a pensioner couple aged under 75. \u0095 \u00a37.50 (\u00a375.25 a week) for a single pensioner aged 75 or over. \u0095 \u00a310 (\u00a3118.15 a week) for a pensioner couple aged 75 or over. We would also adjust tax allowances for older people to compensate pensioners for any extra that they might otherwise pay. And we would adjust means tested benefits to ensure that the poorest pensioners gain at least as much as other pensioners. I heard the Social Security Secretary on the radio this morning claiming that the poorest pensioners would lose out from our proposals. So let me make it absolutely clear that these increases will go to all pensioners, including those on means tested benefits. All pensioners will be entitled to these increases. These, then, are big increases in the basic state pension. In the main, we achieve these increases by consolidating all of the gimmicks into something which pensioners would far prefer - reliable increases in their weekly income. In other words, no more gimmicks means more on the basic pension. But on top of that we are also adding the \u00a340 million bureaucracy bonus, as well as adding money found elsewhere in the social security budget. In total, this amounts to \u00a3320 million of new money for pensioners. Our increase in basic state pension will leave all pensioners better off with the Conservatives than under Labour. And to make sure pensioners can rely on it and that they will know that this is a promise that will be delivered, these increases in the basic state pension would be financed out of National Insurance. It would be a return on all those contributions pensioners have made through their working lives. This reform means dignity and choice and respect for pensioners. It means a larger state pension as an entitlement rather than making pensioners depend on occasional handouts from Government. By turning the handouts into entitlements, into a proper return on national insurance contributions, and by adding in the extra savings, all pensioners will be better off with the Conservatives. In other words, Common Sense for Pensioners means we are offering a real improvement in the income of all pensioners. Unlike the Labour Party, I am not going to make exaggerated promises that unrealistically raise people's expectations only to shatter them later. I know that many pensioners find it difficult to make ends meet. I don't pretend that an extra \u00a310 a week will solve all the problems of pensioners. Let me tell you what I do promise. First, Common Sense for Pensioners means dignity and respect for pensioners. It rightly angers pensioners, who have paid national insurance contributions their entire lives, to have the government announce payments on budget day as if they were the charitable act of a merciful Chancellor. The basic state pension is not charity, it is a return on years of payments. Understanding this and reflecting this in pension policy is a matter of respect for pensioners. My Party is determined to show that respect. Quite apart from the fact that the Chancellor's measures restrict pensioner choice and personal independence they are also patronising. They assume the Government knows better than pensioners how to budget for periods of greater expense and shouldn't give pensioners money until the Government thinks they should spend it. This patronising attitude, too, shows little respect and is accordingly resented. Second, our policy simplifies a key part of the benefits system. This is true to another Tory principle that deplores government waste and inefficiency. Gordon Brown has deliberately made both our tax and benefits system more complicated. He prefers to act by stealth. In this way he is undermining confidence in politics and Government. With our reform pensioners will know exactly what they are getting and how much it is worth. That really is common sense. But let me deal here in advance with some of the slurs and attacks which I expect from our political opponents. Labour will claim that their policies are targeted on poorer pensioners, whereas we offer across the board increases. That is rubbish. Many of their schemes have been indiscriminate. The winter fuel payment goes to the 220,000 more affluent pensioners in residential accommodation or nursing homes who do not claim Income Support; but the payment is not available for the 280,000 in such accommodation who do claim Income Support. In other words better off pensioners get it and worse off ones don't. What we are proposing is better targeted than Labour's measures. We guarantee that this increase in the basic pension will reach all pensioners including those on means-tested benefits, so that poorer pensioners getting at least as much from the package as others. Moreover, we know that poorer pensioners tend to be older and we have therefore put extra money particularly towards pensioners aged over 75. Labour will also try to scare pensioners by claiming that the Tories are simply abolishing the winter fuel payment and the free TV licence. To save them the effort, let me remind the Millbank spindoctors now of what their own former Minister, Peter Kilfoyle, says: 'pensioners believe that winter fuel payments and concessionary television licences are a diversionary measure \u0085 What pensioners want is an increase, week on week, in the basic pension. This is not just a matter of economics: it is a question too of pensioners' dignity' (Hansard, 27th March 2000). The dignity of pensioners is what our package is all about. The key fact, that no amount of Labour lies can obscure, is that all pensioners, regardless of which gimmicks they currently receive, will be better off. There will be others who say that our policy is no substitute for far-reaching welfare reform. I completely agree. This is not our last word on pensions policy. It is the beginning of presenting our vision for the future, one in which more and more pensioners enjoy rising living standards as a result of the savings and the funded pensions they have built up during their working lives. We want to ensure that pensioners participate in the rising living standards of the country as a whole. We will be setting out further proposals to spread funded pensions still more widely to the next generation of pensioners. But that is a policy for people of working age who have yet to become pensioners. It is too late for current pensioners. Many of the pensioners who are managing on such modest incomes retired without any entitlement to a funded pension. However strongly we push forward better funded pensions for the next generation, we still have a debt to the current generation of pensioners. That is what today's package is all about. It gives pensioners a real choice, a choice which gets to the heart of the difference between our two parties. They can choose New Labour's way. The way that treats pensioners as unfortunate misfits in their dreams of Cool Britannia. The way that patronises pensioners with handouts and treats them almost like charity cases. Or they can vote for a genuine Conservative alternative, from a Party which has been listening - a reliable guaranteed increase in the contributory basic state pension. It is quite simply a choice between being treated with contempt or being treated with respect. Today's pensioners have contributed so much to building Britain into the great nation it is today. They have served in our armed forces and fought to keep our nation free; they have worked in our country's businesses and built up its economy; and have they raised our generation and bequeathed us a Britain that begins this new century free and proud and prosperous. Yet despite all they've done their contribution isn't in the past. They are part of our nation's future too. For they are among our most active citizens. Among the most important contributors to voluntary organisations. Among the most important supports for family life. They support much which this country depends on. Today's pensioners do not want sops or charity. They want to feel that they are getting benefits to which they have all their lives contributing to. They want the independence and respect that they have every right to deserve. This year, the Conservative Party has been speaking for the great mainstream majority of the British people on crime, on asylum seekers, on tax and on Europe. That is why we won the local elections so convincingly. Now we are moving on to new areas - areas which Labour have for too long regarded as their own. Today we are speaking for the great mainstream majority of pensioners who feel betrayed and neglected by this Government; today we offer substantial increases in the basic pension instead of gimmicks; today we offer a bold, common sense policy for pensioners.",

They denied that there was any third party involved but the news will fuel tabloid speculation about the pair, who have been an item for 13 years but have reportedly not been seen together in the last four months. They have blamed work commitments for the long absence. Rumours of a split gained currency when Hurley went to the Cannes Film Festival alone, for the first time in six years. Hurley, 34, who models for Estee Lauder, has been linked to New York billionaire Ted Forstmann, while Grant, 39, was reportedly seen dining with a mystery woman at a London hotel in March.

      "byline": "Claire Armitstead",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Adrian Lester's arrival is almost presidential: he bounds out of a courtesy car with his publicist in tow. He has spent the morning rehearsing for Channel 4's Richard Blackwood show and has dashed off to be interviewed before the live recording in the afternoon. He is neat, fit and topped off with an immaculate head of dreadlocks. Of course, he says, they wanted him to show off his break dancing in the studio, but he is in the middle of filming, and body-popping is not the kind of publicity stunt that makes a movie insurer's day. </p> <p>For years now, Lester has been teetering on the brink of stardom. First there was Rosalind, in a celebrated all-male production of As You Like It, then - after a series of increasingly high-profile theatre roles - he was whisked off to Hollywood to play the earnest campaign manager in Mike Nichols's film of Primary Colors. The 11th-hour summons from Nichols meant he had to renege on an earlier commitment to play Othello for Sam Mendes at the National Theatre; the buzz was that the theatre had lost this most talented of actors. </p> <p>But here he is, two years later, at the age of 32, whiling away his time on a shoal of movies while preparing for the big one: he has been cast by Peter Brook as Hamlet, in an international production that will start life at the Bouffe de Nord in Paris and then tour the great theatres of Europe. This, he says, is the actor's dream - \"In fact, it's the actor's joke: 'Brook phoned last night and asked if I'd play Hamlet.' Ho ho.\" </p> <p>But stardom hasn't always played a straight game with Lester. It is one thing to be in demand, quite another to be offered the right work. After making Primary Colors, he returned home to England and waited for the phone to ring. For a year. He could have allowed himself to be swallowed up by Hollywood, but he didn't want that. \"A lot of talent is nurtured here and at the first taste of success, it gets up and goes.\" The problem, he has since discovered, was that everyone assumed he had done the same. </p> <p>Look at Lester's career and you see a fascinating reflection of the times. He was born and brought up in Birmingham, one of three children to Jamaican immigrant parents. His father owned a cleaning company. The young Adrian sang in the cathedral choir and became obsessed, in his teens, with the local youth theatre. By the time he was 16, he had given up on school but was writing, directing, starring in and touring his own play. Like other black actors of his age, he had no role models then. \"I never grew up thinking 'I want to be like him', because there was no him to want to be when I was 13 or 14. The only models were Americans and they weren't for me.\" Unusually, he says he was unaware of any barriers. \"My parents said, 'OK, you want to do this. Then do it. It'll be hard.' And I said, 'How hard?' I wasn't very good at school and never did my homework, but I was up till four in the morning typing plays. I was very driven, and it came from people saying, 'You can do it.' \" </p> <p>He left Birmingham for Rada and and emerged from drama school just as colour-blind casting was catching hold in the theatre. His big break was being cast by Declan Donnellan as Rosalind in As You Like It in 1991; the part of the smooth confidence trickster in John Guare's Olivier award-winning Six Degrees of Separation followed; then Sam Mendes picked him up to play the lonely Bobby in the Sondheim musical Company. </p> <p>As a teenager, he had played bell-boys and car thieves in Crossroads; he soon learned to turn down lucrative work in TV series such as The Bill because they always wanted him to play the mugger. So determined was he to avoid being typecast as the black thug that for a while he was in danger of creating another stereotype for himself - the boy next door, soft, gentle, so generous with his feminine side that a lot of people assumed he was gay. In fact, he is married to an actress, Lolita Chakrabarti, a fellow Brummie he met at drama school. </p> <p>It was his Lolita who, inadvertently, was the model for Rosalind. \"A couple of friends who knew my wife very well came to see it and said I had put Lolita on the stage.\" With a magpie instinct, he had hoarded his wife's mannerisms - \"her wit, her speed, her agility\" - and moulded these unconsidered trifles into a new character. \"It was strange for her, because, once it had been pointed out, she began to see little bits of Rosalind that were definitely her.\" </p> <p>One of the qualities that marks out Lester's work is his ability to resist cliche. He brought a clear note of desolation in Company to Bobby - everyone's friend and nobody's lover - and reached a new peak in Primary Colors, in which his character, Henry Burton, had to carry the possibility of integrity in a corrupt world. In an extraordinary final confrontation between him and John Travolta, Travolta wheedles and bullies him to say he's still behind the presidential campaign. As the film dawdles into real time, Lester's face is not so much impassive as impassable, allowing every possibility to play across it and none to take possession. It is a scene so finely judged that it comes as a shock, at the end, to see him lined up and smiling behind the new president. </p> <p> Primary Colors taught him about the public side of acting. Suddenly he found himself on prime-time TV being quizzed about everything from Clinton's morals to the plausibility of a black campaign manager. One story that did the rounds was that a kissing scene between him and Emma Thompson was cut because the preview audiences didn't like the display of interracial lust. The truth, he says, was much more banal. \"That scene killed the film, because once people knew that Henry was corrupt, they didn't care any more.\" It was only at that stage that it became clear to what extent this young, unknown British actor was carrying the film. </p> <p>After he finished Primary Colors, he was pigeonholed as an upper-class New Yorker. His next role, though, was very different: a troubled man working with disturbed children in an orphanage, in a 90-minute TV film Storm Damage. It was a long-standing project of his friend Lennie James, which only finally made it into production once it had the cachet of Lester's Primary Colors appearance behind it. Lester is too shrewd to underestimate the power that comes with success - \"It means I'm getting the chance to do things I wouldn't have done before\"- but doesn't bang political gongs, and he is almost perversely determined not to become \"a star\" in the old sense of the word. </p> <p>\"If you're a star you are becoming something over and above the job, and that's not something I want to do. To play someone who is just a version of yourself over and over again is boring.\" This might seem a truism, but it takes some will power. He would not, for instance, consider taking a big part in a soap. \"Small parts are all very well, but I wouldn't be interested in doing a long-running character because you're not given a chance to step out. It means destroying one of your main talents as an actor, which is to become someone else.\" </p> <p>This strategy has its risks. He has just come and gone as a break-dancing courtier in Kenneth Branagh's musical verson of Love's Labours Lost, and a barman in a best-forgotten biopic of George Best. Next month he is back in Maybe Baby, Ben Elton's directorial debut, about a couple's problem conceiving.

      "bodyText": "Adrian Lester's arrival is almost presidential: he bounds out of a courtesy car with his publicist in tow. He has spent the morning rehearsing for Channel 4's Richard Blackwood show and has dashed off to be interviewed before the live recording in the afternoon. He is neat, fit and topped off with an immaculate head of dreadlocks. Of course, he says, they wanted him to show off his break dancing in the studio, but he is in the middle of filming, and body-popping is not the kind of publicity stunt that makes a movie insurer's day. For years now, Lester has been teetering on the brink of stardom. First there was Rosalind, in a celebrated all-male production of As You Like It, then - after a series of increasingly high-profile theatre roles - he was whisked off to Hollywood to play the earnest campaign manager in Mike Nichols's film of Primary Colors. The 11th-hour summons from Nichols meant he had to renege on an earlier commitment to play Othello for Sam Mendes at the National Theatre; the buzz was that the theatre had lost this most talented of actors. But here he is, two years later, at the age of 32, whiling away his time on a shoal of movies while preparing for the big one: he has been cast by Peter Brook as Hamlet, in an international production that will start life at the Bouffe de Nord in Paris and then tour the great theatres of Europe. This, he says, is the actor's dream - \"In fact, it's the actor's joke: 'Brook phoned last night and asked if I'd play Hamlet.' Ho ho.\" But stardom hasn't always played a straight game with Lester. It is one thing to be in demand, quite another to be offered the right work. After making Primary Colors, he returned home to England and waited for the phone to ring. For a year. He could have allowed himself to be swallowed up by Hollywood, but he didn't want that. \"A lot of talent is nurtured here and at the first taste of success, it gets up and goes.\" The problem, he has since discovered, was that everyone assumed he had done the same. Look at Lester's career and you see a fascinating reflection of the times. He was born and brought up in Birmingham, one of three children to Jamaican immigrant parents. His father owned a cleaning company. The young Adrian sang in the cathedral choir and became obsessed, in his teens, with the local youth theatre. By the time he was 16, he had given up on school but was writing, directing, starring in and touring his own play. Like other black actors of his age, he had no role models then. \"I never grew up thinking 'I want to be like him', because there was no him to want to be when I was 13 or 14. The only models were Americans and they weren't for me.\" Unusually, he says he was unaware of any barriers. \"My parents said, 'OK, you want to do this. Then do it. It'll be hard.' And I said, 'How hard?' I wasn't very good at school and never did my homework, but I was up till four in the morning typing plays. I was very driven, and it came from people saying, 'You can do it.' \" He left Birmingham for Rada and and emerged from drama school just as colour-blind casting was catching hold in the theatre. His big break was being cast by Declan Donnellan as Rosalind in As You Like It in 1991; the part of the smooth confidence trickster in John Guare's Olivier award-winning Six Degrees of Separation followed; then Sam Mendes picked him up to play the lonely Bobby in the Sondheim musical Company. As a teenager, he had played bell-boys and car thieves in Crossroads; he soon learned to turn down lucrative work in TV series such as The Bill because they always wanted him to play the mugger. So determined was he to avoid being typecast as the black thug that for a while he was in danger of creating another stereotype for himself - the boy next door, soft, gentle, so generous with his feminine side that a lot of people assumed he was gay. In fact, he is married to an actress, Lolita Chakrabarti, a fellow Brummie he met at drama school. It was his Lolita who, inadvertently, was the model for Rosalind. \"A couple of friends who knew my wife very well came to see it and said I had put Lolita on the stage.\" With a magpie instinct, he had hoarded his wife's mannerisms - \"her wit, her speed, her agility\" - and moulded these unconsidered trifles into a new character. \"It was strange for her, because, once it had been pointed out, she began to see little bits of Rosalind that were definitely her.\" One of the qualities that marks out Lester's work is his ability to resist cliche. He brought a clear note of desolation in Company to Bobby - everyone's friend and nobody's lover - and reached a new peak in Primary Colors, in which his character, Henry Burton, had to carry the possibility of integrity in a corrupt world. In an extraordinary final confrontation between him and John Travolta, Travolta wheedles and bullies him to say he's still behind the presidential campaign. As the film dawdles into real time, Lester's face is not so much impassive as impassable, allowing every possibility to play across it and none to take possession. It is a scene so finely judged that it comes as a shock, at the end, to see him lined up and smiling behind the new president. Primary Colors taught him about the public side of acting. Suddenly he found himself on prime-time TV being quizzed about everything from Clinton's morals to the plausibility of a black campaign manager. One story that did the rounds was that a kissing scene between him and Emma Thompson was cut because the preview audiences didn't like the display of interracial lust. The truth, he says, was much more banal. \"That scene killed the film, because once people knew that Henry was corrupt, they didn't care any more.\" It was only at that stage that it became clear to what extent this young, unknown British actor was carrying the film. After he finished Primary Colors, he was pigeonholed as an upper-class New Yorker. His next role, though, was very different: a troubled man working with disturbed children in an orphanage, in a 90-minute TV film Storm Damage. It was a long-standing project of his friend Lennie James, which only finally made it into production once it had the cachet of Lester's Primary Colors appearance behind it. Lester is too shrewd to underestimate the power that comes with success - \"It means I'm getting the chance to do things I wouldn't have done before\"- but doesn't bang political gongs, and he is almost perversely determined not to become \"a star\" in the old sense of the word. \"If you're a star you are becoming something over and above the job, and that's not something I want to do. To play someone who is just a version of yourself over and over again is boring.\" This might seem a truism, but it takes some will power. He would not, for instance, consider taking a big part in a soap. \"Small parts are all very well, but I wouldn't be interested in doing a long-running character because you're not given a chance to step out. It means destroying one of your main talents as an actor, which is to become someone else.\" This strategy has its risks. He has just come and gone as a break-dancing courtier in Kenneth Branagh's musical verson of Love's Labours Lost, and a barman in a best-forgotten biopic of George Best. Next month he is back in Maybe Baby, Ben Elton's directorial debut, about a couple's problem conceiving. None is either a conspicuously great part or a great film - bringing to mind the wise wise words of another performer who straddles both theatre and film, Kathleen Turner. \"As an actor,\" she said, \"you're as known for what you do not do as what you do do.\" But then there is the film he and Lolita are writing together, and there is Hamlet. The long gestation that is customary with Peter Brook is already under way: there have been workshops and \"terrifyingly intelligent\" discussions. Is he daunted? \"Yes.\" Does he have any ideas about how he is going to play it? \"There are always all these questions: is he mad or not? Does he love his mother or not? The answer is yes to all of these things.\" He is relaxed and driven, self-doubting and confident - and open to all the possibilities these qualities create. A Hamlet for the 21st century. Maybe Baby is released on June 2.",

He walked out of the West Indies' tour of England in 1995 after disputes with the captain, Richie Richardson, and manager, Wes Hall.

Competitive at home and terrible on tour is how the Windies have performed recently, and the risk of a thrashing by England is reduced with the Trinidadian in the team. Also there must have been pressure from the English Cricket Board, who realised that Lara could get bodies through turnstiles like few players are able to. England will probably turn over Zimbabwe - they do not need a severely weakened West Indies to complete their summer. </p> <p>So what does the future hold for Brian Charles? The time is coming when the West Indian board will have to conclude that he's just not worth the headache, and accept short-term failure by leaving him out so that the team can keep its collective sanity.

Every time he criticises, he is costing the railways something - such as a new manager who will not now come into the industry!\"</p> <p>At the same time, he has failed to take the railways in hand and build on the first-rate framework left by the Tories. So, the opposition thinks, the government should be more critical, but, at the same time, less critical. This is the sort of thing oppositions are paid to say.</p> <p>Mr Norman recalled the dark days when he was a member of the old British Railways Board. According to his text, it was housed in \"a building of dusty corridors and rigid hierarchy. It was large and formal men in formal suits served tea and coffee in an ante-room.\" (A puzzle: should nobody have served tea and coffee, or if they did, ought they to have worn jeans and sweaters?) Mr Norman had solutions, all of which were for trains to be more like Asda.</p> <p>Sunday services should be improved. \"Supermarkets don't sell worse products on a Sunday,\" he said. No queues at ticket offices. At Asda, they open another checkout when the lines build up. And anyone who didn't have a seat would get the journey free.</p> <p>We hacks inquired whether the companies might simply ban people from the trains if there weren't enough seats. Commuters would get rather cross.</p> <p>\"I don't think that's very likely,\" said Mr Norman, vaguely. \"Anyway, we've got three years to get to that point.\"</p> <p>At this point his understrapper, Mr Bernard Jenkin, started chafing. My impression was that Mr Jenkin, who is a bit of a trainspotter, with a smart two-piece tailored anorak, thinks that his boss doesn't know what he's talking about.</p> <p>\"The number of passengers is already subject to regulation,\" he said briskly. \"They are called 'pixies', which means 'passengers in excess of capacity'.\"</p> <p>So, after three years, any passenger forced to stand will get a free pointed cap with a bell on top.</p> <p>\"At Asda, we give a refund in all circumstances. That is because we are customer-led,\" said Mr Norman. That may be the answer to the Tories' problems - loyalty cards and cash back bonuses.</p> <p>Back at my desk a colleague brings me Hansard, with a speech by Michael Fabricant marked. It's wonderfully barking, even by Mickey's standards. He was taking part in a filibuster on something or other.</p> <p>\"Imagine it is the year 850. Dank mists lie over the water, and all that can be heard is the swish-swash of oars from a longboat as it enters a misty inlet, which, in future, will be known by the Icelandic for misty inlet, Reykjavik Norsemen would debate not in a parliament contained by a roof, but in a parliament contained by the heavens. The acoustics were such that they used to shout at each other, aiming their voices at a cliff. Debates sometimes lasted two, three or four weeks.\"</p> <p>So, no change there, then.</p>",

Mr Norman recalled the dark days when he was a member of the old British Railways Board. According to his text, it was housed in \"a building of dusty corridors and rigid hierarchy. It was large and formal men in formal suits served tea and coffee in an ante-room.\" (A puzzle: should nobody have served tea and coffee, or if they did, ought they to have worn jeans and sweaters?) Mr Norman had solutions, all of which were for trains to be more like Asda. Sunday services should be improved. \"Supermarkets don't sell worse products on a Sunday,\" he said. No queues at ticket offices. At Asda, they open another checkout when the lines build up. And anyone who didn't have a seat would get the journey free. We hacks inquired whether the companies might simply ban people from the trains if there weren't enough seats. Commuters would get rather cross. \"I don't think that's very likely,\" said Mr Norman, vaguely. \"Anyway, we've got three years to get to that point.\" At this point his understrapper, Mr Bernard Jenkin, started chafing. My impression was that Mr Jenkin, who is a bit of a trainspotter, with a smart two-piece tailored anorak, thinks that his boss doesn't know what he's talking about. \"The number of passengers is already subject to regulation,\" he said briskly. \"They are called 'pixies', which means 'passengers in excess of capacity'.\" So, after three years, any passenger forced to stand will get a free pointed cap with a bell on top. \"At Asda, we give a refund in all circumstances. That is because we are customer-led,\" said Mr Norman. That may be the answer to the Tories' problems - loyalty cards and cash back bonuses. Back at my desk a colleague brings me Hansard, with a speech by Michael Fabricant marked. It's wonderfully barking, even by Mickey's standards. He was taking part in a filibuster on something or other. \"Imagine it is the year 850. Dank mists lie over the water, and all that can be heard is the swish-swash of oars from a longboat as it enters a misty inlet, which, in future, will be known by the Icelandic for misty inlet, Reykjavik Norsemen would debate not in a parliament contained by a roof, but in a parliament contained by the heavens. The acoustics were such that they used to shout at each other, aiming their voices at a cliff. Debates sometimes lasted two, three or four weeks.\" So, no change there, then.",

      "body": "<p>The headlines on the financial news wire services yesterday were all too familiar to students of past Labour governments. Sterling was on the slide, falling to its lowest level against a basket of world currencies this year. But if stories about the pound weakening would once have set alarm bells ringing in Downing Street and the Treasury, this time the government could not be happier.</p> <p>For 2000 is unlike 1931, 1949, 1967 and 1976 - the dark days of capital flight, devaluations and the arrival of the International Monetary Fund. This time, Labour's problem is that the pound has been too strong, not too weak, and the growing clamour for the government to do something about it has threatened to blow apart its carefully crafted position on joining the euro.</p> <p>The fact that the single currency has lost a third of its value since its launch 17 months ago has been a mixed blessing, both for the 11 countries in the euro zone and for Britain. The weak euro has been a political embarrassment in euroland but it has meant that exporters in Germany, France, Italy and elsewhere have seen the price of their goods fall, allowing them to sell more. The beneficiaries of the strong pound in the UK have been consumers, particularly those on low incomes, who have been able to buy more as the price of imported goods has fallen.</p> <p>But exporters have had a terrible time, with the 20% appreciation of the pound leaving them with the choice of either cutting profit margins or losing overseas customers altogether. Around 200,000 jobs have been lost in manufacturing over the past year and investment plans have been mothballed as firms have tried to cut costs.</p> <p>As a result, the government has been under mounting pressure to do something about the level of the pound, with those in favour of British membership of the euro arguing that Labour should commit Britain to joining the single currency at a lower rate than today's as the centrepiece of a strategy to make UK exports more competitive. This was the theme of Peter Mandelson's remarks last week in which he said that sterling would always be vulnerable to movements on the foreign exchanges while Britain was outside monetary union.</p> <p>Despite the political fuss caused by the remarks, the Northern Ireland secretary was broadly correct. Joining the single currency would eliminate all risk of the pound's gyrations affecting exports to Britain's main markets, although, as the 30% fall in the euro against the dollar has shown, there could still be exchange rate problems with the rest of the world.</p> <p>But life is never quite that simple. Membership of the single currency also entails ceding control over interest rates, which not only involves political questions of nations being able to influence their own economic policies but also entails costs.</p> <p>Senior treasury officials stress that the downside to putting a stable pound at the heart of economic policy was aptly illustrated in two distinct phases between 1987 and 1992. First, Nigel Lawson adopted a policy of shadowing the German mark, which involved cutting UK interest rates to prevent sterling from rising too far. The result of this was to fuel the unsustainable boom of the late 80s, which was only controlled by a doubling of interest rates to a crippling 15%. Then, when the inevitable recession was just under way, Mrs Thatcher reluctantly took Britain into the European exchange rate mechanism in October 1990.</p> <p>For the next two years, interest rates in the UK were kept higher than they should have been to prevent the pound from falling, contributing to the record level of bankruptcies and home repossessions in the early 90s. Only after John Major's government was humbled by George Soros on Black Wednesday in September 1992 did interest rates come down and economic recovery begin.</p> <p>This is the background to the caution being shown by Tony Blair and Gordon Brown over the euro.</p> <p>Both believe the long slog to win a reputation for managerial competence could be thrown away by the actions necessary to target a lower exchange rate for sterling, and that joining monetary union is too momentous a decision to be made on the basis of short-term expediency.</p> <p>The government's economic advisers point out that the only way to bring down the pound would be to cut interest rates to a level that would risk stoking up inflation in the domestic economy, plunge the economy back into a boom-bust cycle and perhaps cost Labour the next election.</p> <p>At root, the government would prefer to remain outside the single currency rather than join when the economic conditions are not right. Despite the recent problems for exporters, the economy has done well since 1992, with an unprecedented period of growth and the lowest inflation in Europe.</p> <p>As ministers see it, there are two possible ways that Britain could join the single currency. One is that a full-scale economic crisis makes the safe haven of the euro far more attractive to voters. The alternative is that the government minimises the economic risks of joining what was essentially a political project through a period of convergence and is then able to persuade the electorate from a position of strength that it is the right decision for Britain.</p> <p>Given that the UK economy is more in synch with the United States than mainland Europe, such convergence will be problematical, perhaps even impossible. But one inescapable truth of the 20th century is that bad economics results in bad politics. This government, above all others, does not intend to repeat the old mistakes.</p>",

But exporters have had a terrible time, with the 20% appreciation of the pound leaving them with the choice of either cutting profit margins or losing overseas customers altogether. Around 200,000 jobs have been lost in manufacturing over the past year and investment plans have been mothballed as firms have tried to cut costs. As a result, the government has been under mounting pressure to do something about the level of the pound, with those in favour of British membership of the euro arguing that Labour should commit Britain to joining the single currency at a lower rate than today's as the centrepiece of a strategy to make UK exports more competitive. This was the theme of Peter Mandelson's remarks last week in which he said that sterling would always be vulnerable to movements on the foreign exchanges while Britain was outside monetary union. Despite the political fuss caused by the remarks, the Northern Ireland secretary was broadly correct. Joining the single currency would eliminate all risk of the pound's gyrations affecting exports to Britain's main markets, although, as the 30% fall in the euro against the dollar has shown, there could still be exchange rate problems with the rest of the world. But life is never quite that simple. Membership of the single currency also entails ceding control over interest rates, which not only involves political questions of nations being able to influence their own economic policies but also entails costs. Senior treasury officials stress that the downside to putting a stable pound at the heart of economic policy was aptly illustrated in two distinct phases between 1987 and 1992. First, Nigel Lawson adopted a policy of shadowing the German mark, which involved cutting UK interest rates to prevent sterling from rising too far. The result of this was to fuel the unsustainable boom of the late 80s, which was only controlled by a doubling of interest rates to a crippling 15%. Then, when the inevitable recession was just under way, Mrs Thatcher reluctantly took Britain into the European exchange rate mechanism in October 1990. For the next two years, interest rates in the UK were kept higher than they should have been to prevent the pound from falling, contributing to the record level of bankruptcies and home repossessions in the early 90s. Only after John Major's government was humbled by George Soros on Black Wednesday in September 1992 did interest rates come down and economic recovery begin. This is the background to the caution being shown by Tony Blair and Gordon Brown over the euro. Both believe the long slog to win a reputation for managerial competence could be thrown away by the actions necessary to target a lower exchange rate for sterling, and that joining monetary union is too momentous a decision to be made on the basis of short-term expediency. The government's economic advisers point out that the only way to bring down the pound would be to cut interest rates to a level that would risk stoking up inflation in the domestic economy, plunge the economy back into a boom-bust cycle and perhaps cost Labour the next election. At root, the government would prefer to remain outside the single currency rather than join when the economic conditions are not right. Despite the recent problems for exporters, the economy has done well since 1992, with an unprecedented period of growth and the lowest inflation in Europe. As ministers see it, there are two possible ways that Britain could join the single currency. One is that a full-scale economic crisis makes the safe haven of the euro far more attractive to voters. The alternative is that the government minimises the economic risks of joining what was essentially a political project through a period of convergence and is then able to persuade the electorate from a position of strength that it is the right decision for Britain. Given that the UK economy is more in synch with the United States than mainland Europe, such convergence will be problematical, perhaps even impossible. But one inescapable truth of the 20th century is that bad economics results in bad politics. This government, above all others, does not intend to repeat the old mistakes.",

Later, in the Commons, the shadow defence secretary, Iain Duncan Smith, welcomed the pull-out of the troops but warned there were several different militias loosely associated with the SLA and there was a risk that the British arms might find their way into rebel hands. The Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman, Menzies Campbell, backed moves by the British to arm and train the SLA. But he added: \"If the policy is now to try to turn the SLA into an effective force able to hold the ring once the British go, then of course it means the British can't go until that has been achieved. \"That may well mean that this is a rather more open-ended commitment than we've been told about so far.\" Mr Campbell told the defence secretary: \"There's some relief that you have now abandoned the fiction that the British forces are not combat troops. Isn't it clear that the success which they have enjoyed is precisely because of the fact that they are ready and capable of combat and that anyone who seeks to interfere with their activities will find that out to their cost?\" Labour's Donald Anderson, chairman of the Commons foreign affairs select committee, said the attainment of the defence secretary's broader political objectives in Sierra Leone would be \"formidably difficult\". \"Do you really expect the Sierra Leone army, in its degree of fragmentation, lack of morale, even with the light arms that we will supply, being a match or being able, even with the UN, to inflict such a decisive military defeat on the RUF, that they will not be able to move into Liberia and regroup and have a continuing state of turbulence in that country?\" he asked. Mr Hoon said it was important to link the prospect of withdrawal of British forces with an effective training team in Sierra Leone which would be able to carry through the \"difficult process\" of bringing the remainder of the country under control. A Labour backbencher, David Winnick, said a good illustration of the crimes and atrocities taking place in Sierra Leone was found in a photograph of a 14-month-old child who had her hand cut off six months ago. Mr Hoon said: \"One of the appalling aspects of what has been taking place in Sierra Leone is that it's not impossi ble that that child lost its arm as a result of the activities of child soldiers who perhaps were only a few years older on the other side. \"That is why it is necessary that Sierra Leone should return to peace and stability and that is why it's important that we should assist that government,\" he said. In further exchanges, Mr Hoon said the RUF of Foday Sankoh had to be isolated. \"The continued detention of Sankoh assists in that process and we do want to see him brought to trial and we want it to be quite clear that he should no longer have any influence over the RUF in Sierra Leone.\"",

      "body": "<p>Bob Ayling's fate was sealed when he went cap in hand once again to the millennium commission for a further \u00a338.6m to bail out the dome. The body, chaired by the culture secretary, Chris Smith, had already pumped \u00a3509m of lottery money into the Greenwich white elephant and its patience had run out. Agreeing a \u00a329m lifeline to stave off bankruptcy, the commission demanded their man before the New Millennium Experience Company got its dome cash.</p> <p>\"There were a lot of angry people being asked to come up with the money once again,\" claimed a commission insider. \"It was the straw that broke the camel's back.\"</p> <p>Mr Ayling, 53, is destined to be remembered as the high flyer who fell to earth. Twice. In two months.</p> <p>Crash number one was in March when Britain's favourite airline dispensed with the services of one of Labour's favourite businessmen as British Airways headed for a 98% cut in profits. Crash number two was the loss of his post as chairman of the dome, a post admirers insisted he enjoyed and critics claimed would earn him a knighthood or even peerage. After failing twice, even a party notorious for rewarding its cronies may now be forced to think twice before adding his name to the honours list.</p> <p>History has a way of repeating itself and the \"resign or be sacked\" ultimatum presented to Mr Ayling on Monday - withdrawn last night as a last minute face-saving measure - will have had a familiar ring. Only last February he issued the same threat to Jennie Page, the dome's chief executive, when he orchestrated a coup to bring in the previously obscure Pierre-Yves Gerbeau as the project's saviour.</p> <p>The captain of industry appears not to have seen the axe coming and had been upbeat last Wednesday when he chose the dome to make his first public appearance since his BA departure.</p> <p>In jovial mood, he told guests at an airline industry lunch beneath the huge structure that he'd bought a boat the day before and had \"several irons in the fire\". Describing how he enjoyed travelling to Greenwich on the Jubilee line extension, he boasted the complex was \"one of the most popular events in the world\".</p> <p>A diner said last night: \"I'm convinced he didn't know he was going to be sacked. He had the air of a man back on the way up, not one thinking he was going to get fired.\"</p> <p>Mr Ayling picked up the poisoned chalice that is the dome in February 1997 when he was handed the unpaid chairmanship of the New Millennium Experience Company by Roger Freeman, the Tory cabinet office minister.</p> <p>Admired by Tony Blair, who at one point hoped he would stand as mayor of London, and so close a friend of Jack Straw he threw a joint 50th birthday party with the home secretary, New Labour automatically kept him on. The decision now to ditch one of their own suggests how brutal New Labour can be in power.</p> <p>It is inconceivable the culture secretary would have made the move without consulting Downing Street and Lord Falconer, the Cabinet Office minister who is the government's sole shareholder in the New Millennium Experience Company.</p> <p>Yet a senior official in the culture department maintained Mr Ayling's resignation was not pre-planned and he was no scapegoat. \"It was not to my knowledge discussed beforehand,\" he said. \"The anger was genuinely spontaneous.\"</p> <p>The same source insisted the decision was backed by most, if not all, the commission members present at Monday's special meeting, including Michael Heseltine and the writer Simon Jenkins.</p> <p>Mr Ayling liked to be seen as a man of the people. He would eat in the canteen with other staff both at BA and the dome, greeting employees as if they were long lost friends. When BA moved into a new HQ at Heathrow three years ago, it was cold at first so he wore a jumper. Soon other people started to copy him, creating an informal corporate culture.</p> <p>The son of a shopkeeper, the young Ayling had to leave fee-paying King's school, Wimbledon, at 16 when his father's business collapsed. He joined a law firm and was a partner by 24 before joining BA to climb swiftly up the airline via the legal department and personnel to chief executive in 1996.</p> <p>Some in the City considered him a failure and were surprised he lasted so long. Ditching the traditional design of red, white and blue tailfins in favour of \"world\" colours was a disaster; tie-ups with US airlines another disaster; and a three day dispute in 1997 cost BA \u00a3125m. Union negotiators dubbed him \"Bob Fayling\" and would mock the chief executive behind his back.</p> <p>Peter Ainsworth, the Tory culture spokesman, said Mr Ayling had been made a fall guy to save ministers.</p> <p>\"I don't think his departure halfway through its life will make any difference,\" said Mr Ainsworth. \"I think that he's been scapegoated and we have seen it before. Lord Falconer is the sole shareholder. Where is he? The government wanted the headlines to be about Ayling and not the money.\"</p> <p>Mr Ainsworth could also legitimately ask where is Peter Mandelson, who was instrumental in persuading Mr Blair not to ditch the dome when Labour replaced the Tories? He hoped it would be the greatest show on earth, representing all that was good about Cool Britannia with a spectacular closing ceremony this New Year's Eve forming a springboard to a spring 2001 election.</p> <p>Mr Smith, always a sceptic who feared it would never be a success, will now go into the next election with plans to channel lottery money to the poor, the sick and children in disarray after once again bailing out the dome.</p> <p>Asked why, when he was still on top of the world, he lived in the same modest south London home bought a couple of decades ago, Mr Ayling just shrugged. \"If I got the sack tomorrow everyone I know who lives nearby would still know me as Bob Ayling. I wouldn't be this bloke that has just got the sack.\"</p> <p><b>The politicians who escaped the blame</b></p> <p><b>Lord Falconer of Thoroton:</b> Cabinet Office minister with responsibility for the dome. However, as a peer he cannot be called to account before the Commons and has so far managed to avoid being tainted by the dome chaos. The hunt by the opposition and Labour backbenchers for a ministerial scapegoat could mean some of the mud finally sticks.</p> <p><b> Chris Smith:</b> culture secretary and, as chairman of the millennium commission, the dome's banker. Labour critics argue he has a conflict of interest as both \"lender and borrower\" to and from the dome - authorising loans from the commission and holding final responsibilty in his departmental role. But he has also avoided blame, largely because he is seen as sceptical about the scheme.</p> <p><b> Peter Mandelson:</b> formerly in charge of the dome until he quit the cabinet in December 1998. Fought the early PR battles for the project after Labour inherited, overseeing the early design decisions. His shedding of dome responsibilty was widely seen as the only silver lining to his fall from grace, and he is likely to fight to repel any suggestion of subsequent taint from the scheme's woes.</p> <p><b> Michael Heseltine:</b> former deputy prime minister who first pushed the dome project and has remained a millennium commissioner. Still one of the dome's overseers, but - in opposition - will be unlikely to have to suffer flak for the latest crisis. <br><b>Lucy Ward</b></p> <p><b>The bail-outs</b></p> <p>\u0095 The dome will have cost more than \u00a3100 per visitor if 7m visit it this year</p> <p>\u0095 The \u00a329m emergency grant means the total lottery money it has received is \u00a3538m - \u00a3139m more than planned</p> <p>\u0095 Total budget remains \u00a3758, but ticket revenue is down and lottery handouts up</p> <p>\u0095 Initial costings: \u00a3399m in lottery money; \u00a3150m sponsorship; \u00a315m from final sale; and \u00a3194m commercial revenue</p> <p>\u0095 Three emergency grants total \u00a3139m: \u00a350m for free admission of 1m schoolchildren; \u00a360m bail-out in March; and latest \u00a329m</p> <p>\u0095 Plus side: sponsorship \u00a310m higher; site now expected to bring in \u00a3100m.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Bob Ayling's fate was sealed when he went cap in hand once again to the millennium commission for a further \u00a338.6m to bail out the dome. The body, chaired by the culture secretary, Chris Smith, had already pumped \u00a3509m of lottery money into the Greenwich white elephant and its patience had run out. Agreeing a \u00a329m lifeline to stave off bankruptcy, the commission demanded their man before the New Millennium Experience Company got its dome cash. \"There were a lot of angry people being asked to come up with the money once again,\" claimed a commission insider. \"It was the straw that broke the camel's back.\" Mr Ayling, 53, is destined to be remembered as the high flyer who fell to earth. Twice. In two months. Crash number one was in March when Britain's favourite airline dispensed with the services of one of Labour's favourite businessmen as British Airways headed for a 98% cut in profits. Crash number two was the loss of his post as chairman of the dome, a post admirers insisted he enjoyed and critics claimed would earn him a knighthood or even peerage. After failing twice, even a party notorious for rewarding its cronies may now be forced to think twice before adding his name to the honours list. History has a way of repeating itself and the \"resign or be sacked\" ultimatum presented to Mr Ayling on Monday - withdrawn last night as a last minute face-saving measure - will have had a familiar ring. Only last February he issued the same threat to Jennie Page, the dome's chief executive, when he orchestrated a coup to bring in the previously obscure Pierre-Yves Gerbeau as the project's saviour. The captain of industry appears not to have seen the axe coming and had been upbeat last Wednesday when he chose the dome to make his first public appearance since his BA departure. In jovial mood, he told guests at an airline industry lunch beneath the huge structure that he'd bought a boat the day before and had \"several irons in the fire\". Describing how he enjoyed travelling to Greenwich on the Jubilee line extension, he boasted the complex was \"one of the most popular events in the world\". A diner said last night: \"I'm convinced he didn't know he was going to be sacked. He had the air of a man back on the way up, not one thinking he was going to get fired.\" Mr Ayling picked up the poisoned chalice that is the dome in February 1997 when he was handed the unpaid chairmanship of the New Millennium Experience Company by Roger Freeman, the Tory cabinet office minister. Admired by Tony Blair, who at one point hoped he would stand as mayor of London, and so close a friend of Jack Straw he threw a joint 50th birthday party with the home secretary, New Labour automatically kept him on. The decision now to ditch one of their own suggests how brutal New Labour can be in power. It is inconceivable the culture secretary would have made the move without consulting Downing Street and Lord Falconer, the Cabinet Office minister who is the government's sole shareholder in the New Millennium Experience Company. Yet a senior official in the culture department maintained Mr Ayling's resignation was not pre-planned and he was no scapegoat. \"It was not to my knowledge discussed beforehand,\" he said. \"The anger was genuinely spontaneous.\" The same source insisted the decision was backed by most, if not all, the commission members present at Monday's special meeting, including Michael Heseltine and the writer Simon Jenkins. Mr Ayling liked to be seen as a man of the people. He would eat in the canteen with other staff both at BA and the dome, greeting employees as if they were long lost friends. When BA moved into a new HQ at Heathrow three years ago, it was cold at first so he wore a jumper. Soon other people started to copy him, creating an informal corporate culture. The son of a shopkeeper, the young Ayling had to leave fee-paying King's school, Wimbledon, at 16 when his father's business collapsed. He joined a law firm and was a partner by 24 before joining BA to climb swiftly up the airline via the legal department and personnel to chief executive in 1996. Some in the City considered him a failure and were surprised he lasted so long. Ditching the traditional design of red, white and blue tailfins in favour of \"world\" colours was a disaster; tie-ups with US airlines another disaster; and a three day dispute in 1997 cost BA \u00a3125m. Union negotiators dubbed him \"Bob Fayling\" and would mock the chief executive behind his back. Peter Ainsworth, the Tory culture spokesman, said Mr Ayling had been made a fall guy to save ministers. \"I don't think his departure halfway through its life will make any difference,\" said Mr Ainsworth. \"I think that he's been scapegoated and we have seen it before. Lord Falconer is the sole shareholder. Where is he? The government wanted the headlines to be about Ayling and not the money.\" Mr Ainsworth could also legitimately ask where is Peter Mandelson, who was instrumental in persuading Mr Blair not to ditch the dome when Labour replaced the Tories? He hoped it would be the greatest show on earth, representing all that was good about Cool Britannia with a spectacular closing ceremony this New Year's Eve forming a springboard to a spring 2001 election. Mr Smith, always a sceptic who feared it would never be a success, will now go into the next election with plans to channel lottery money to the poor, the sick and children in disarray after once again bailing out the dome. Asked why, when he was still on top of the world, he lived in the same modest south London home bought a couple of decades ago, Mr Ayling just shrugged. \"If I got the sack tomorrow everyone I know who lives nearby would still know me as Bob Ayling. I wouldn't be this bloke that has just got the sack.\" The politicians who escaped the blame Lord Falconer of Thoroton: Cabinet Office minister with responsibility for the dome. However, as a peer he cannot be called to account before the Commons and has so far managed to avoid being tainted by the dome chaos. The hunt by the opposition and Labour backbenchers for a ministerial scapegoat could mean some of the mud finally sticks. Chris Smith: culture secretary and, as chairman of the millennium commission, the dome's banker. Labour critics argue he has a conflict of interest as both \"lender and borrower\" to and from the dome - authorising loans from the commission and holding final responsibilty in his departmental role. But he has also avoided blame, largely because he is seen as sceptical about the scheme. Peter Mandelson: formerly in charge of the dome until he quit the cabinet in December 1998. Fought the early PR battles for the project after Labour inherited, overseeing the early design decisions. His shedding of dome responsibilty was widely seen as the only silver lining to his fall from grace, and he is likely to fight to repel any suggestion of subsequent taint from the scheme's woes. Michael Heseltine: former deputy prime minister who first pushed the dome project and has remained a millennium commissioner. Still one of the dome's overseers, but - in opposition - will be unlikely to have to suffer flak for the latest crisis. Lucy Ward The bail-outs \u0095 The dome will have cost more than \u00a3100 per visitor if 7m visit it this year \u0095 The \u00a329m emergency grant means the total lottery money it has received is \u00a3538m - \u00a3139m more than planned \u0095 Total budget remains \u00a3758, but ticket revenue is down and lottery handouts up \u0095 Initial costings: \u00a3399m in lottery money; \u00a3150m sponsorship; \u00a315m from final sale; and \u00a3194m commercial revenue \u0095 Three emergency grants total \u00a3139m: \u00a350m for free admission of 1m schoolchildren; \u00a360m bail-out in March; and latest \u00a329m \u0095 Plus side: sponsorship \u00a310m higher; site now expected to bring in \u00a3100m.",

He said a section of the party leadership was repeatedly shooting itself in the foot and described them as old timers, dinosaurs and forces for conservatism. Mr Robinson's election, topping the poll on a very low turnout, and his remarks suggest Millbank will have to rethink its strategy towards its party activists. The editor of Tribune, Mark Seddon lost his seat, but many of the newly elected NEC members are far from Blairite clones. Apart from Mr Robinson, the party membership also elected Ruth Turner, founder of the northern edition of the Big Issue, and Ann Black, an Oxford activist who has been fighting ,and so far failing, at the party policy forum, to restore the earnings link for pensions. Shahid Malik, a 34-year-old Asian community worker and the first elected member of the Commission for Racial Equality, was also elected. Mr Malik told the leadership yesterday that they \"were in danger of taking the ethnic minority vote for granted and seeing its instinctive support ebbing away\". Lord (Tom) Sawyer, former party general secretary, came second in the poll, but he too in recent weeks has been warning Downign Street that it is danger of losing contact with the rank and file. The low turnout in the poll, probably half the average figure for recent years, may reflect a wider disillusionment in the party, or a belated recognitition that the NEC is no longer the important power base of the past. However, Ms Black said she had also been inundated by party members complaining they had not received ballot papers, or had not been aware the papers had been slipped inside the party's free magazine. Mr Robinson launched an attack on those on the NEC who had \"shot the party in the foot\" over internal elections. He said that the decision on the NEC by seven votes to five to block the chairman of the National Organisation of Labour Students, Joe Goldberg, from standing again epitomised a mentality that had to stop. He said: \"The Labour party has done reasonably well in balancing on the one hand radical polices of redistribution with economic prudence.

      "bodyText": "Bob Ayling resigned as chairman of the Millennium Dome company last night after a heated three-hour board meeting which left directors claiming that the former BA chief executive had been made a scapegoat to protect ministers' reputations. His allies refused to let him step down until the Millennium Commission lifted its demand that he should do so as a condition of its \u00a329m emergency handout from National Lottery funds. Opposition parties and Labour backbenchers called for ministers to take some responsibility for the crisis, while the government tried to distance itself from the turmoil. As the political row intensified, directors of the New Millennium Experience company at yesterday's meeting resisted pressure to accept their chair man's offered resignation until, after telephone calls to Chris Smith, the culture secretary and commission chairman, the gun was removed from Mr Ayling's head. The dome minister, Lord Falconer, who attended the meeting, said: \"Bob decided to resign in the best interests of the dome.\" He added: \"Bob's contribution to the dome has been second to none. But he has made a judgment. He has made a selfless decision.\" A new chairman, thought to be Michael Grade, chief executive of First Leisure Corporation and former head of Channel 4, has been chosen from the existing directors. In Westminster, Labour MPs frustrated at serial scapegoating demanded a public inquiry into the funding of the project. Forty-six signed a Commons motion expressing \"deep concern and alarm\" at the lottery lifeline and demanding a government guarantee that no more public money - whether from the lottery or taxation - would be given to the NMEC. Bob Marshall-Andrews, the Medway MP heading the motion, said Mr Ayling's enforced departure was \"an entirely cosmetic exercise\" designed to protect ministers. Lord Falconer holds the government's single share in the NMEC and Mr Smith chairs the Millennium Commission. It emerged yesterday that the commission twice sought a written assurance from Robin Young, permanent secretary of the culture department, that the extra cash it would get to cover this year's two emergency grants to NMEC would not deprive other projects. Downing Street said: \"It is not the government's job to run a visitor attraction. These are management decisions taken by NMEC and the Millennium Commission.\" The government did not believe the company would ask for more cash, and the latest grant was being discussed on the basis that the dome would stay open until the end of the year, the spokesman said.",

Yesterday's meeting also revealed a recognition that party activists matter. Mr Prescott warned: \"We need to get the activists back,\" as the meeting heard repeated accounts of activists refusing to turn out to campaign. Sir Jeremy Beecham, the most senior figure in Labour local government, also told the meeting that councillors were the lifeblood of the party, and the leadership needed to show greater respect for local government. Ian McCartney, the Cabinet Office minister and Prescott ally, said party activists needed revitalising with a \"delivery\" card outlining the Labour government's achievements so far, on the lines of the five early pledges card employed during the 1997 general election. Mark Seddon, ironically thrown off the NEC yesterday, said he believed the rank and file may have finally persuaded the leadership to listen. He said: \"We've almost got there, but it has been two and a half wasted years with the leadership knocking people off, block ing people when their face didn't fit and generally letting the control freak charge stick.But I think they are finally starting to listen. \"They realise there have got to be one member one vote elections for city mayors.\" He predicted the party would abandon or dilute plans to abolish general committees, the main decision making body of local constituencies. Yet For the past five years the future of the NEC has been in the balance as power and ihnfluence ebbed away. The era when a gaggle of journalists waited all day outside the party headquarters to hear news of a ignominious leadership defeat has long gone. In the eighties, staff surrounding the Labour leader Neil Kinnock were dedicated exclusively to squaring difficult NEC votes. Partly through the work of Charles Clarke, his then chief of staff, Mr Kinnock started regularly winning votes until a rump of Dennis Skinner and Diane Abbot were left seconding each other's motions. Now the machine purrs pretty smoothly, and cliffhanging votes are as rare as in the heyday of Stalin's politburo. A series of reforms, engineered by Mr Kinnock and the then party general secretary Lord Sawyer, has removed policy making from discordant NEC sub-committees to joint policy commissions in which NEC and MPs share power. In practice, however, government ministers, aided by Millbank officials, tend to dominate on the joint policy commission. The more informal behind closed doors biannual policy forum has not yet led to vigorous internal debate. The NEC's status has also been reduced by fewer meetings and the banning of MPs from standing for the constitruency section. Previously the annual poll for the constituency section became the only serious barometer of party membership opinion, as well as a beauty contest for Labour politicians.

      "bodyText": "Multi-media group Imagination Technologies - hitherto one of the year's hi-tech Cinderellas - became yesterday a heroine of the sector, with a 162% profits surge helping to hold up a sagging Techmark index in London. The graphics, video and audio specialist made \u00a34.7m in the year to March 31, from \u00a31.8m in 1998/99, well ahead of the \u00a33.9m that had been expected by City analysts. Imagination owns the rights to the graphics chip for Sega's games console, and has a strategic partnership with ST Microelectronics of France, with whom it is to launch its first graphics chip for personal computers in June. Imagination shares fell from an all-time closing price high of 610p in February to about 233p at the start of May on concerns over poor sales of Sega's Dreamcast machine, but yesterday it proved one of the anchors of Techmark, with the shares rising 18.5p to 261p. Imagination's growth has been powered by the relationship with Sega, but the company expects increasing revenue from the partnership, announced last year, with ST, one of the main providers of chips for PCs. With ST, Imagination is producing chips for television set-top boxes. It expects its \u00a35m acquisition in March of Ensigma, the audio technology company, to bear fruit. Ensigma makes technology for radio studios, home entertainment systems and voice recognition devices, and is a leader in telephone \"voice dialling\". Its products are in use by the Ministry of Defence. Imagination said the ST tie-up and the acquisition of Ensigma helped to broaden its intellectual property base, adding it had its eye on further acquisitions in related areas. Earnings per share rose by 127% to 2.5p, from 1.1p in 1999.",

      "bodyText": "The world's biggest drinks company, Diageo , tumbled 47.25p to 547.5p as a report that it wants to buy the US group Bestfoods went down the wrong way. Critics want the company to exit food, rather than expand in it, so it can concentrate on its more profitable beers and spirits. Insiders played down the chances of a deal, suggesting Bestfoods was talking to anybody and everybody. Unilever , another contender for the US company, slipped 1p to 467.25p. Fears of an apocalypse for technology stocks proved over the top - the market was generally calmer after Monday's slump. The FTSE 100 yo-yoed during the day - but at the close, the FTSE 100 index was 51.3 points easier at 6,086.8, above session lows at 6,026.3, but well be low its early peak at 6,128.5. Volume was moderate, with 1.205bn shares changing hands in 101,461 transactions - Vodafone Airtouch was again the biggest traded stock (141m shares), but M&amp;S also saw large volumes (52m). Vodafone's rise - to nearly 259p - accounted for most of the Footsie's improvement. Far and away the biggest FTSE percentage gainer was high street retailer Marks &amp; Spencer , up nearly 18% percent at 260p in a sharp recovery from Monday's near 10-year low. The move came despite a slump in profits and the first dividend cut in the com pany's history, a move analysts took as signalling Britain's biggest clothing retailer might have finally halted its fall from grace. Barclays jumped 29p to \u00a316.51 on the back of plans for a net push, while dealers squirted life into Lloyds TSB , lifting them 8p to 664p. It was not all good news in the old economy. British Airways failed to take off - losing 8p at 366.5p, as smaller-than-expected losses failed to lift the shares. Marconi was up 18p at 771p after announcing further expansion moves, with plans to acquire US data centre, IT Business for $113m. CSFB has also raised its price target for Marconi to 1,050p in the wake of last week's results, reiterating its \"buy\" rating. Tech stocks had a mixed day - BATM saw big gains, rising 292p to \u00a332.92 But other new economy shares fell hard. Celltech Group topped the FTSE 100 fallers list, shedding 80p to 920p, with ARM Holdings close behind, off 34p at 516p, followed by Kingston Telecom, down 19p at 516p, and Colt Telecom, off 57p at 1,805p.

      "body": "<p>The world welcomed baby Leo, but few as warmly as those pressing the government to revise its Dickensian policies on work/life balance. By chance the Blair baby has arrived right into the middle of national childcare week and its organisers could hardly contain their grins. In Westminster junior ministers and MPs (all of them women) were nudging one another, gloating and beaming.</p> <p>Hello Leo! In this tiny personage is now vested high hopes of radical change. There is a groundswell of anger about our over-working, brutalising long hours culture and Labour's deliberate weakening of every EU directive aimed at making life bearable for working families. Not so much New Labour as Hard Labour. Now in the air there hovers the inescapable image of the infant Leo.</p> <p>It's not that anyone thinks the prime minister has gone soft. Perish the thought. Only last week he went out of his way to promise the CBI that there would be ever less regulation on employers, boasting that Britain's employers are even more lightly regulated than in the United States.</p> <p>His government is still trying to deny parental leave to the great majority of parents, even as his wife acted in court for the TUC. Yesterday, disgracefully, the government effectively got its way.</p> <p>Although the judges said the TUC case was \"likely to prevail\", they still sent the case off to Brussels where it may take two years, by which time many of the disputed parents will have lost their rights as their children will be over five years old: a good example of justice delayed being justice denied.</p> <p>But whatever his father thinks, Leo's presence will not let the issue to go away. Look at that charming picture of the prime minister taking his parental leave, lolling on a sofa in his casual clothes cooing happily to his baby while his government prevents most other parents doing likewise. It just doesn't look good.</p> <p>It's another worrying example of how Downing Street is losing its political touch. Obstinacy on parental leave is needless folly when the case could have been gracefully withdrawn with a sincere promise to think again. Why do they bother fighting it so hard when this unpaid parental leave will be taken by very few? Only parents in countries where the leave is paid can afford to take it.</p> <p>Little Leo will raise other questions. For example, when will his mother go back to work? Will it be as soon as paid maternity is over at 18 weeks, like most women have to, far too soon? Or will it be after the other 11 weeks unpaid which only a few well-off women can afford to take - also too soon?</p> <p>Then comes childcare. Most families don't and can't afford to pay for childcare. If Leo was lucky enough to get into one of the very few Westminster council nurseries (there are only 117 places in the whole borough for non-special needs children), it would cost \u00a3171 a week.</p> <p>The maximum poor families can claim in childcare tax credits is \u00a370 a week. Although that seemed a huge and generous sum when Gordon Brown gave this first ever significant state help with childcare, alas, it turns out that most childcare now costs between \u00a3130-\u00a3160 a week. (In London it is even more.)</p> <p>It may be unfair but there will be no avoiding these comparisons between Leo and other babies. Perhaps it was partly invited in that moving part of last year's prime ministerial party conference speech: \"There is no more powerful symbol of our politics than the experience of being on a maternity ward, seeing two babies side by side, delivered by the same doctors and midwives.</p> <p>\"Yet with two totally different lives ahead of them. One returns with his mother to a bed and breakfast that is cold, damp, cramped. A mother who has no job, no family to support her, sadder still - no one to share the joy and triumph of the new baby, a father nowhere to be seen. . . . The second child returns to a prosperous home, grandparents desperate to share the caring and a father with a decent income and an even larger sense of pride.\"</p> <p>He called for \"strong families cherished by strong communities\", and although he was talking mainly about this fine promise to abolish child poverty in 20 years, it takes good, family-friendly policies to support strong families.</p> <p>Today a Mori poll for national childcare week asks mothers what hinders them returning to work. Three quarters of parents polled said it as lack of affordable childcare.

      "bodyText": "The world welcomed baby Leo, but few as warmly as those pressing the government to revise its Dickensian policies on work/life balance. By chance the Blair baby has arrived right into the middle of national childcare week and its organisers could hardly contain their grins. In Westminster junior ministers and MPs (all of them women) were nudging one another, gloating and beaming. Hello Leo! In this tiny personage is now vested high hopes of radical change. There is a groundswell of anger about our over-working, brutalising long hours culture and Labour's deliberate weakening of every EU directive aimed at making life bearable for working families. Not so much New Labour as Hard Labour. Now in the air there hovers the inescapable image of the infant Leo. It's not that anyone thinks the prime minister has gone soft. Perish the thought. Only last week he went out of his way to promise the CBI that there would be ever less regulation on employers, boasting that Britain's employers are even more lightly regulated than in the United States. His government is still trying to deny parental leave to the great majority of parents, even as his wife acted in court for the TUC. Yesterday, disgracefully, the government effectively got its way. Although the judges said the TUC case was \"likely to prevail\", they still sent the case off to Brussels where it may take two years, by which time many of the disputed parents will have lost their rights as their children will be over five years old: a good example of justice delayed being justice denied. But whatever his father thinks, Leo's presence will not let the issue to go away. Look at that charming picture of the prime minister taking his parental leave, lolling on a sofa in his casual clothes cooing happily to his baby while his government prevents most other parents doing likewise. It just doesn't look good. It's another worrying example of how Downing Street is losing its political touch. Obstinacy on parental leave is needless folly when the case could have been gracefully withdrawn with a sincere promise to think again. Why do they bother fighting it so hard when this unpaid parental leave will be taken by very few? Only parents in countries where the leave is paid can afford to take it. Little Leo will raise other questions. For example, when will his mother go back to work? Will it be as soon as paid maternity is over at 18 weeks, like most women have to, far too soon? Or will it be after the other 11 weeks unpaid which only a few well-off women can afford to take - also too soon? Then comes childcare. Most families don't and can't afford to pay for childcare. If Leo was lucky enough to get into one of the very few Westminster council nurseries (there are only 117 places in the whole borough for non-special needs children), it would cost \u00a3171 a week. The maximum poor families can claim in childcare tax credits is \u00a370 a week. Although that seemed a huge and generous sum when Gordon Brown gave this first ever significant state help with childcare, alas, it turns out that most childcare now costs between \u00a3130-\u00a3160 a week. (In London it is even more.) It may be unfair but there will be no avoiding these comparisons between Leo and other babies. Perhaps it was partly invited in that moving part of last year's prime ministerial party conference speech: \"There is no more powerful symbol of our politics than the experience of being on a maternity ward, seeing two babies side by side, delivered by the same doctors and midwives. \"Yet with two totally different lives ahead of them. One returns with his mother to a bed and breakfast that is cold, damp, cramped. A mother who has no job, no family to support her, sadder still - no one to share the joy and triumph of the new baby, a father nowhere to be seen. . . . The second child returns to a prosperous home, grandparents desperate to share the caring and a father with a decent income and an even larger sense of pride.\" He called for \"strong families cherished by strong communities\", and although he was talking mainly about this fine promise to abolish child poverty in 20 years, it takes good, family-friendly policies to support strong families. Today a Mori poll for national childcare week asks mothers what hinders them returning to work. Three quarters of parents polled said it as lack of affordable childcare. Employers have done virtually nothing to help - only 3% have workplace nurseries, only 5% offer help with costs. It helps explain why not nearly enough mothers invited to join the New Deal for Lone Parents have taken up the offer. The main point of childcare tax credits was to try to entice the 900,000 single mothers living on benefits into work: so far few have, even in this booming employment market.

      "bodyText": "Guardian Media Group and the venture capital firm BC Partners are close to a deal to unite Auto Trader in a group of classified advertising magazines spanning Britain and Europe. At present, GMG and BC Partners each own a string of regional editions of Auto Trader. They are negotiating to put these together to create a jointly controlled business called Trader Media Group. The newly created company would include a string of other titles such as Bike Trader, Top Marques and Auto Freeway. With annual profits of more than \u00a360m, it would employ around 3,500 people. Insiders said yesterday that talks to create Trader Media Group were at an advanced stage. The two sides are keen to pool their resources, ending an arrangement whereby they publish parallel regional titles with a cross-licensing arrangement over the Auto Trader name. The origins of the existing situation date back around 20 years. GMG started a car advertising magazine at the same time as a rival publication was launched by John Madejski, now the multi-millionaire chairman of Reading football club. GMG and Mr Madejski each expanded into different areas of the country and eventually agreed to divide the regions between them. Mr Madejski sold his Auto Trader titles to BC Partners three years ago, reportedly making a fortune of some \u00a3170m. In some regions, GMG and BC Partners already have joint ownership of magazines. Trader Media Group is expected to be owned 50-50 by the two companies. As a venture capital group, BC Partners is likely to want to sell its interest at some point in the future, possibly to GMG. Trader Media Group's total portfolio would contain over 790 publications, with a combined weekly circulation of more than 1m. Other interests would include Auto Trader's website, autotrader.co.uk, which is one of the ten most visited retail sites in Britain. International operations include businesses in Belgium, Holland, Italy and South Africa. Magazines intended for inclusion in Trader Media Group have more than 200,000 automotive items for sale at any one time, plus 140,000 other items. GMG's chief executive, Bob Phillis, is likely to be chairman of Trader Media Group with Graham Luff as chief executive.

Instead, he has had to watch the mighty prizefighters of his beloved Israel Defence Force rush to get home in a matter of days - expelled by the 500 or so volunteers of Hizbullah. Lands the Israeli army had ruled for 22 years, they have had to leave in 22 hours.</p> <p>Israelis will be relieved to be shot of the place: time spent travelling around the country last week told me that much. Lebanon had become their Vietnam, a place where soldiers went to die for a cause no one believed in. That's why the homecoming troops waved their flags, honked their horns and kissed the soil as they returned yesterday. But their relief will be coated with shame: Israel's aura of military invincibility, established since the Yom Kippur war of 1973, has been punctured by the few, but unexpectedly skilled fighters of Hizbullah. It could prove a devastating blow for the Jewish state - and for its leader.</p> <p>For Ehud Barak is the man who was meant to work miracles. Elected in a landslide one year ago this week, he was hailed as the saviour who would capture the two holy grails of Israeli life: peace and security. As the most-decorated soldier in the country's history - a former commando who had risen to become chief of staff - he promised Israelis would feel safe. But as the leader of the Labour party, he also pledged to be a peacemaker. He would pick up where his mentor, general-turned-politician Yitzhak Rabin, had left off (before his assassination in 1995). Armed with the credibility of his uniform, he would make rapid peace with the Palestinians, the Syrians and the Lebanese; he promised an end to the entire Arab-Israeli conflict within a year. What happened along the way, between that May of hope and this May of humiliation, teaches an unexpected lesson - that war and warmaking is hard, but politics and peacemaking is harder.</p> <p>Take the current flight from Lebanon. Although the manner of the departure has been forced on Barak, the fact of it has not. On the contrary, a unilateral pullback to Israel's northern borders was one of Barak's key election promises last year. He told Israelis they would quit their \"security zone\" whether there was a peace deal with Lebanon and its Syrian masters or not. It seemed winningingly simple: vote Barak and what he called the \"ongoing tragedy\" to the north would be over.</p> <p>Events have not proved so clearcut. Besides the loss to Israel's prestige, there is a variety of new dangers. The residents of the country's border towns have understood the most obvious threat instantly: with no buffer zone, they are now within staring distance of the Hizbullah guerrillas and their hi-tech weaponry. Their response has been swift: they have got into their cars and headed south. Some suggested that the homes they have left behind should now become military posts, to guard the border and fend off Hizbullah.</p> <p>But there is a less immediate danger, too. As one of Israel's leading military analysts, Ze'ev Schiff, has argued, the current rout in Lebanon may set a bleak precedent. \"In the Arab world, more and more people are saying that the only language Israel understands is the language of force,\" Schiff wrote in the left-leaning paper, Ha'aretz. Arab leaders used to believe, following the lead set by Egypt in 1979, that only peace treaties would prompt Israel to give up land. But the fighters of Hizbullah in southern Lebanon, like the stonethrowers of the intifada in the West Bank and Gaza before them, have proved that when force is applied, Israeli troops leave - eventually.</p> <p>Might this explain last week's surge in violence on the West Bank, the worst trouble in four years? Have the Palestinians been inspired by Hizbullah? Moreover, if this is what happens when Barak gives up southern Lebanon - whose loss no Israeli will mourn - then how much harder will it be for him to sell a withdrawal from the fondly-held Golan Heights? Israel's prime minister is willing to return that land to the Syrians: but will his fellow countrymen accept such a move, when it will put yet more Israelis within shooting range of a hostile nation?</p> <p>What all these questions amount to is the sober lesson Ehud Barak has had a year to draw: that politics is different from soldiering. As a commander, he could give an order and his will would be done. In international diplomacy, nothing is ever so easy.</p> <p>So he arrived in office wanting a deal with the Syrians, assuming his will and determination would be enough to make it happen. What he has learned is that Damascus does not go in for Damascene conversions; it does not change overnight. Even though a deal on the Golan may seem tantalisingly close, the Syrians are holding it up - by demanding the shoreline of the Sea of Galilee. Progress on the Palestinian track is more hopeful, but the current trouble on the West Bank is a worry: last week Barak told the Israeli delegation at back-channel peace talks with the PLO in Stockholm to fly home.</p> <p>The problem for the PM is that the world will not bend to his will the way his elite unit once did. He cannot issue an order demanding that Israel instantly absorb the 1m immigrants who have arrived from the former Soviet Union over the past decade. Nor can he heal the rift between Israel's religious and secular Jews simply by uttering a command.</p> <p>In fact, under Israel's byzantine electoral system, he cannot even make his own government function properly. Cabinet ministers refuse to work together: drawn from minor parties that hate each other he has to spend, he estimates, 80% of his time nudging and cajoling them all just to keep his coalition together. It is frail and could well break up before the year is out: Barak may go back to the country, pleading for a decisive parliamentary mandate to match the personal one he received last year.</p> <p>So the transition from khaki to Knesset has not been smooth for Ehud Barak. And yet he is such a quietly impressive man. Quoting Kant and Jefferson in interviews, playing his Steinway piano at night, he has somehow turned down the volume of Israeli politics. The hysteria, and corrosive sleaze, of the Netanyahu years has gone. He has replaced it with a hard-headed realism which is prepared to tell Israelis the uncomfortable truth: that they must live within their own, shrunken borders; that they must live in peace with their neighbours, and that they cannot rule over another people. General Barak has fought impossible missions before - and won. Let's hope his greatest victory is still ahead.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:jonathan.freedland@theguardian.com\">jonathan.freedland@theguardian.com</a></p>",

      "body": "<p>An angry Suffolk farmer yesterday dug up 27 acres of GM contaminated oilseed rape, which he - like more than 500 other farmers - planted after it was imported accidentally because there were no government checks. </p> <p>John Sanderson, who owns a 450 acre mixed arable farm near Harleston, said he was flabbergasted when he learned last week that the seed he had bought contained genetically modified contamination. </p> <p>He is to re-sow his fields with uncontaminated seeds which he knows he can sell - and take legal advice about gaining compensation for his losses and extra work. </p> <p>In a separate incident yesterday, 20 anti-GM activists occupied the Ministry of Agriculture's headquarters in central London for several hours, accusing the government of contamination of the countryside. </p> <p>The contamination, which has resulted in over 30,000 acres being planted with GM seed, centres on supplies produced by Advanta and imported from Canada. </p> <p>The government was first told on April 17 about the mistake, but did not make it public until a month later. No decision has been made on compensation. </p> <p>Supermarket chains who use the oil in foods like margarine and biscuits specify their products contain no GM ingredients and will refuse to buy the contaminated crops. The husks go for animal feed which some chains also now want to be GM-free. </p> <p>Mr Sanderson, 44, said he had been contacted by a seed merchant last week and told that he had been mistakenly sold GM spring seed. </p> <p>He said that he would be taking legal advice in an attempt to gain compensation for loss of the crop, which he said was worth \u00a35,000. </p> <p>He said: \"It may be that in the future I will decide to grow GM crops. But that has got to be my decision and I will take it if I feel the public is ready for it.\" </p> <p>Advanta is understood to have advised UK farmers not to destroy their crops. The agriculture minister, Nick Brown, told MPs there were \"no health or environmental risks\" following the accidental planting. </p> <p>Friends of the Earth campaigner Pete Riley said: \"This is a brave action by an individual farmer facing company pressure and government indifference. But it is a disgrace that farmers have been put in this position.\" </p> <p>Tension between the Welsh assembly and the Department of the Environment in London will come to the boil today when assembly members vote to oppose planting of GM crops in Wales. </p> <p>The issue is seen by some opposition members as a key test of the assembly's devolved powers and follows uproar over farm trials of GM forage maize in north east Wales. </p> <p>The GM crop was planted at Sealand, Flintshire, earlier this month in the face of opposition in Cardiff and pleas by the Welsh agriculture secretary, Christine Gwyther, for the trial to be switched to a site in England.</p>",

      "bodyText": "An angry Suffolk farmer yesterday dug up 27 acres of GM contaminated oilseed rape, which he - like more than 500 other farmers - planted after it was imported accidentally because there were no government checks. John Sanderson, who owns a 450 acre mixed arable farm near Harleston, said he was flabbergasted when he learned last week that the seed he had bought contained genetically modified contamination. He is to re-sow his fields with uncontaminated seeds which he knows he can sell - and take legal advice about gaining compensation for his losses and extra work. In a separate incident yesterday, 20 anti-GM activists occupied the Ministry of Agriculture's headquarters in central London for several hours, accusing the government of contamination of the countryside. The contamination, which has resulted in over 30,000 acres being planted with GM seed, centres on supplies produced by Advanta and imported from Canada. The government was first told on April 17 about the mistake, but did not make it public until a month later. No decision has been made on compensation. Supermarket chains who use the oil in foods like margarine and biscuits specify their products contain no GM ingredients and will refuse to buy the contaminated crops. The husks go for animal feed which some chains also now want to be GM-free. Mr Sanderson, 44, said he had been contacted by a seed merchant last week and told that he had been mistakenly sold GM spring seed. He said that he would be taking legal advice in an attempt to gain compensation for loss of the crop, which he said was worth \u00a35,000. He said: \"It may be that in the future I will decide to grow GM crops. But that has got to be my decision and I will take it if I feel the public is ready for it.\" Advanta is understood to have advised UK farmers not to destroy their crops. The agriculture minister, Nick Brown, told MPs there were \"no health or environmental risks\" following the accidental planting. Friends of the Earth campaigner Pete Riley said: \"This is a brave action by an individual farmer facing company pressure and government indifference. But it is a disgrace that farmers have been put in this position.\" Tension between the Welsh assembly and the Department of the Environment in London will come to the boil today when assembly members vote to oppose planting of GM crops in Wales. The issue is seen by some opposition members as a key test of the assembly's devolved powers and follows uproar over farm trials of GM forage maize in north east Wales. The GM crop was planted at Sealand, Flintshire, earlier this month in the face of opposition in Cardiff and pleas by the Welsh agriculture secretary, Christine Gwyther, for the trial to be switched to a site in England.",

The lord chief justice, Lord Bingham, and Mr Justice Morison, signalled that they believed the decision to limit the right to parents of children born after December 15 1999 breached European law. But they opted to send the case to Luxembourg rather than take the decision themselves. Unless the Trades Union Congress, which challenged the government's regulations in the high court, appeals successfully to the House of Lords, the case could take up to two years to resolve through Luxembourg's long winded machinery. The judgment was a victory for the prime minister's wife, Cherie Booth QC, because the judges said her arguments on behalf of the TUC were \"likely to prevail\" in Luxembourg. The TUC challenged the regulations, which give parents the right to 13 weeks leave for family responsibilities during a child's first five years, but limit the right to those whose children were born or adopted after the regulations came into effect on December 15 1999. The TUC argued the European directive on parental leave did not intend that 2.7m parents of children born or adopted before then but still under five would be excluded. The government argued that the words of the directive, which provide for parental leave \"on the grounds of the birth or adoption of a child\", mean that the right is triggered once the regulations are in force and a child is subsequently born or adopted. Ms Booth argued that the words included anyone who had a child up to the age of five at the time the rules came into effect or later. The judges said that although they believed the TUC's arguments would prevail, the position was not clear enough for them to decide the point without guidance from the Luxembourg court.

More recently, the paper has struggled to keep its circulation above 4m. It was criticised for its role in the trial of Gary Glitter for paying a witness, Alison Brown. The judge said the payments were a \"a highly reprehensible state of affairs\", and the press complaints commission issued a rebuke. A lenient sentence was passed on the Earl of Hardwicke, after a judge accepted that had he not been entrapped by a NoW reporter into taking cocaine he would not have committed the offence. Mr Murdoch is said by some to have become fed up of the number of stories about drug-taking by stars. \"Rupert is far less surprised that celebrities take cocaine than Phil appears to be,\" one insider said. It is thought that Ms Wade's changes will be evolutionary: at the Sun, she changed the way the Page 3 girl was presented, without abolishing the feature. At the NoW, the sex scandal diet may be updated, but not abandoned. \"Reporters will still be making their excuses and leaving,\" another source said. Ms Wade's position at the Sun is to be filled by Fergus Shanahan, 45, who joined in 1989 as assistant night editor. Mr Yelland said: \"I will miss Rebekah. We worked together for two wonderful years. However, her departure is good news both for her and the company.\"",

      "body": "<p>There comes a time when a youth culture begins to jockey for position in the hit parade of pop cultural history, to prove that it really mattered , and that its legacy will endure. It usually occurs when a pop movement's originators are old enough to have stopped living it full-time and begin looking fondly backwards. Over the past three years, this is exactly what has happened with acid house and Ecstasy culture; a phenomenon which comes to a head this week with the Channel 4 documentary The Chemical Generation. </p> <p>This is the first televisual attempt to investigate the late-80s origins of the British dance-drug scene, seen through the eyes of those who not only survived it, but thrived on it - the DJs, musicians (such as Boy George), promoters and journalists who constitute what is now called the \"dance industry\": the legal profiteers from an illicit subculture. The film makes this explicit by shooting them in decidedly upscale locations - trendy cappuccino bars, designer-minimalist kitchens, chic modern British restaurants. Everyone's clothes look much more svelte and expensive than the sweaty rave gear of a decade earlier. Many are tanned and conspicuously affluent. History, it seems, is still written by the winners, while the drop-outs and casualties are cast adrift in time. (At this point I must declare that, as the author of a book on the subject, I also appear as a talking head in the film). </p> <p>The film cuts straight to the big question: what did it all mean? Most of the answers are decidedly and disappointingly Blairite. Acid house, opine several, unleashed a huge wave of creativity which enabled young people to set up their own small businesses, promoted the reputation of Britain as a cultural beacon to the world, and paved the way for Cool Britannia icons like Oasis and Trainspotting. A more adventurous point is made by Radio 1 DJ Judge Jules, who sees it as a final break with post-war austerity and the last tremble of the stiff upper lip. \"British people have the reputation of being the maddest rather than the most boring, tame and conservative\", he states. </p> <p>No one dares to suggest that it in any way \"changed the world\" - except for establishing a mass recreational drug culture - and even Ken Tappenden, the garrulous Kent policeman who ran the Pay Party Unit responsible for busting raves in the late 80s admits that it probably wasn't as subversive as he once thought. \"I wonder whether the amount of [police] time, resources, money that has been ploughed into this has all been worth it\", he says wistfully. </p> <p>Like Justin Kerrigan's big-screen hit Human Traffic, which pictured nightlife as a rite of passage into adulthood with the endless lost weekend as a transformative catalyst, The Chemical Generation positions E culture firmly in the tradition of weekender hedonism dating back to the mods. Little is said about outlaw techno-travellers like Spiral Tribe, who hooked the rave scene into the direct-action eco-protest movement, and nothing about the neo-hippies who imagined acid house as a digitally enhanced continuation of Timothy Leary's psychedelic consciousness-expansion programme. </p> <p>Jon Reiss's forthcoming film on the US rave scene, Better Living Through Circuitry, does exactly the opposite, featuring a parade of wide-eyed freaks insisting that E culture is a form of spiritual ritual (one even propounds the theory that the Last Supper was a dance party where Jesus and his crew grooved 'til dawn). While they may sound naive, at least they're not cynical. And yet none of these documentaries explores house and techno's roots in black and gay culture, despite token references to the racial unity and sexual tolerance of raves. History is being rewritten and the usual suspects are being left out. </p> <p>Then there are those who saw raves simply as a way to make some cash. Ecstasy culture, a by-product of Thatcherite on-yer-bike individualism, was always entrepreneurial - mainly on the wrong side of the law. However, as it has become assimilated into the mainstream (even The Sun, which once declared acid house a threat to the morality and health of British youth, now has a regular club-culture column), the breadheads and marketing men have moved in to clean up. Mark Rodol, MD of the Ministry of Sound, states that he provides \"civilised raving\" in a \"safe, well-managed environment\".

      "bodyText": "There comes a time when a youth culture begins to jockey for position in the hit parade of pop cultural history, to prove that it really mattered , and that its legacy will endure. It usually occurs when a pop movement's originators are old enough to have stopped living it full-time and begin looking fondly backwards. Over the past three years, this is exactly what has happened with acid house and Ecstasy culture; a phenomenon which comes to a head this week with the Channel 4 documentary The Chemical Generation. This is the first televisual attempt to investigate the late-80s origins of the British dance-drug scene, seen through the eyes of those who not only survived it, but thrived on it - the DJs, musicians (such as Boy George), promoters and journalists who constitute what is now called the \"dance industry\": the legal profiteers from an illicit subculture. The film makes this explicit by shooting them in decidedly upscale locations - trendy cappuccino bars, designer-minimalist kitchens, chic modern British restaurants. Everyone's clothes look much more svelte and expensive than the sweaty rave gear of a decade earlier. Many are tanned and conspicuously affluent. History, it seems, is still written by the winners, while the drop-outs and casualties are cast adrift in time. (At this point I must declare that, as the author of a book on the subject, I also appear as a talking head in the film). The film cuts straight to the big question: what did it all mean? Most of the answers are decidedly and disappointingly Blairite. Acid house, opine several, unleashed a huge wave of creativity which enabled young people to set up their own small businesses, promoted the reputation of Britain as a cultural beacon to the world, and paved the way for Cool Britannia icons like Oasis and Trainspotting. A more adventurous point is made by Radio 1 DJ Judge Jules, who sees it as a final break with post-war austerity and the last tremble of the stiff upper lip. \"British people have the reputation of being the maddest rather than the most boring, tame and conservative\", he states. No one dares to suggest that it in any way \"changed the world\" - except for establishing a mass recreational drug culture - and even Ken Tappenden, the garrulous Kent policeman who ran the Pay Party Unit responsible for busting raves in the late 80s admits that it probably wasn't as subversive as he once thought. \"I wonder whether the amount of [police] time, resources, money that has been ploughed into this has all been worth it\", he says wistfully. Like Justin Kerrigan's big-screen hit Human Traffic, which pictured nightlife as a rite of passage into adulthood with the endless lost weekend as a transformative catalyst, The Chemical Generation positions E culture firmly in the tradition of weekender hedonism dating back to the mods. Little is said about outlaw techno-travellers like Spiral Tribe, who hooked the rave scene into the direct-action eco-protest movement, and nothing about the neo-hippies who imagined acid house as a digitally enhanced continuation of Timothy Leary's psychedelic consciousness-expansion programme. Jon Reiss's forthcoming film on the US rave scene, Better Living Through Circuitry, does exactly the opposite, featuring a parade of wide-eyed freaks insisting that E culture is a form of spiritual ritual (one even propounds the theory that the Last Supper was a dance party where Jesus and his crew grooved 'til dawn). While they may sound naive, at least they're not cynical. And yet none of these documentaries explores house and techno's roots in black and gay culture, despite token references to the racial unity and sexual tolerance of raves. History is being rewritten and the usual suspects are being left out. Then there are those who saw raves simply as a way to make some cash. Ecstasy culture, a by-product of Thatcherite on-yer-bike individualism, was always entrepreneurial - mainly on the wrong side of the law. However, as it has become assimilated into the mainstream (even The Sun, which once declared acid house a threat to the morality and health of British youth, now has a regular club-culture column), the breadheads and marketing men have moved in to clean up. Mark Rodol, MD of the Ministry of Sound, states that he provides \"civilised raving\" in a \"safe, well-managed environment\". Much as I appreciate his concern for the welfare of his customers, without an element of sheer uncivilised, anarchic abandon, where exactly is the excitement? How will The Chemical Generation appear to the teenage initiates of today, the pilled-up cyberkids gurning their way through the trance anthems at Gatecrasher, or to the Versace-clad UK garage massive down at Twice As Nice? Will they see acid house as an ancestry to be revered, or just a bunch of old gits blethering on about their golden years? Personally, I hope it is the latter. The most vital youth cultures treat the past with irreverence - as a resource to be sampled and abused at will, to be sacrificed on the altar of the eternal present.

      "body": "<p>From an early age musician Jem Finer had what he calls \"a recurring daymare\". It went like this: if he wanted to record everything that ever happened to him in detail, he would spend his whole life writing down what he was doing, and that would mean he would be writing that he was writing - and then, ultimately, writing that he was writing that he was writing. You might call it infinity anxiety. </p> <p>Years later, while playing the banjo with punk folk band the Pogues, an idea came to him in the back of the tour bus. It helped him partially resolve his panic. Fed up with the limits of the three-minute songs he was playing, he decided to write something truly long term. He conceived of a piece of music that would play for 1,000 years without repetition. It would be a way to mark every atom of time without having to write it down. He called it Longplayer and set about writing the music and figuring out a way it could be performed continuously for the requisite 365,243 days. </p> <p>Longplayer struck its first note on millennium midnight and the music is still playing as you read this. Its concert hall is as unorthodox as the piece itself.

These intervals - octaves, fifths and fourths - are the ones that appear recurrently in folk songs across the world as well as in classical music. \"It's impossible to say what people are going to consider music in 200 years or even 20 years, but these harmonic intervals have a resonance,\" he says. </p> <p>Sitting up in the lighthouse's old lamp room, surrounded by speakers playing Longplayer's ambient strains, Finer surveys a panorama of post-industrial wasteland, Canary Wharf tower and the dome.

      "bodyText": "From an early age musician Jem Finer had what he calls \"a recurring daymare\". It went like this: if he wanted to record everything that ever happened to him in detail, he would spend his whole life writing down what he was doing, and that would mean he would be writing that he was writing - and then, ultimately, writing that he was writing that he was writing. You might call it infinity anxiety. Years later, while playing the banjo with punk folk band the Pogues, an idea came to him in the back of the tour bus. It helped him partially resolve his panic. Fed up with the limits of the three-minute songs he was playing, he decided to write something truly long term. He conceived of a piece of music that would play for 1,000 years without repetition. It would be a way to mark every atom of time without having to write it down. He called it Longplayer and set about writing the music and figuring out a way it could be performed continuously for the requisite 365,243 days. Longplayer struck its first note on millennium midnight and the music is still playing as you read this. Its concert hall is as unorthodox as the piece itself. For the first year of its life it is being performed at the disused Trinity Buoy Wharf Lighthouse on the north bank of the Thames opposite the Millennium Dome. Calling it music, might be stretching a point - the clock-like sounds have no conventional harmony or melody, no discernible rhythm pattern. But Finer insists it was composed \"with elements to do with the pure physics of music. I recorded a 20-minute piece of music using metal Tibetan prayer bowls and gongs. You can play them in different ways: you can make them vibrate by drawing a stick around their edge, you can hit them, you can put water in them and bring out new overtones.\" He fed a piece of the recorded music into a computer, replicated it six times, then wrote a code (as a pre-Pogue he gained a degree in computing) for the computer to play each sample at a different speed, thus altering the pitch of the sounds.

Sitting up in the lighthouse's old lamp room, surrounded by speakers playing Longplayer's ambient strains, Finer surveys a panorama of post-industrial wasteland, Canary Wharf tower and the dome.

It's tempting, for instance, to start a column discussing the current Mike Tyson debate by reminding ourselves what a nasty big bastard he is. However, given that this columnist is white, Tyson is black, and lots of people are understandably sensitive about the whole thing, it's simply not on. Tyson's nasty big bastardom apparently is not the point. It's a black issue, a women's issue, a political issue, even a \"sport\" issue. All correct, of course, so thank heavens for one area where we can still confidently say that Tyson's re-entry into the UK is not an issue at all. It is not a Scottish issue.</p> <p>You could be forgiven for thinking otherwise if you were sufficiently misguided to take anything as currently volatile and contradictory as a Scottish daily newspaper. The Daily Record, a previously harmless tabloid which mutated horribly under its new recent editorship, has become so repulsive in its warped views that one requires long tongs and a strong stomach to turn its pages.</p> <p>Such an organ is, of course, making a great play on the fact that it is Scotland that has been slighted, insulted and offended. Not Britain you understand, not rape victims, not black people, not women, not justice, not demoralised immigration officials. No indeed, nothing compares with the wrong done to Scotland by the evil death star of arrogant English administration. Not even a grotesque reference to kind, honourable Frank Bruno when he was described in the press by a certain female columnist who should be killed, resuscitated and killed again, as \"a great hulk of a black man equally as capable of violence in the ring who, unlike Tyson, chose not to use it outside\". Ah yes, the great hulking black men. All potential rapists, eh? Some just choose not to do what comes naturally.</p> <p>Offensive? Er, just a bit. But no. None of these offences amounts to anything in the face of Scotland's shame. Straw was blatantly acting contrary to the will of the Scottish people. The Daily Record, for those of you who are not familiar with its peculiarities, has a very special magic power that tells it what the \"will of the Scottish people\" is without actually having to ask any of us. But this kind of utter pish was not simply confined to the tabloids, where pish resides so happily in its natural habitat. The Scottish Parliament joined in the fray with useful contributions from Alex Salmond, who appeared to believe that the immigration laws in Scotland were somehow different from the rest of the UK and should be put to good use. The New Labour chaps yapped like tiny toy poodles, threatening Blair with the terrifyingly militant prospect of maybe mentioning it next time they see him, if he's not too busy.</p> <p>Part of me doesn't want to go on, really. It's like telling tales on a friend. Why spoil the main blessing of devolution, namely that all the depressing, low-brow, red-neck nonsense that has surfaced since we innocently voted \"yes\", has been going on quietly up here, while England irritatingly basks in post-conservatism, confidently regaining a sense of civilisation and decency lost to it for more than two decades. That wasn't supposed to be the way it was going to happen, damn you. You see no one reads the Guardian, the Times or the Telegraph in Scotland, and no one in England reads the Scotsman. Actually, come to think of it, no one in Scotland reads the Scotsman either since Andrew Neil took over, but that's a different story.</p> <p>It's worth breaching the privacy of our new Scottish stupidity over the Tyson unpleasantness, because the covert misogyny that's at the core of Straw's decision must be highlighted as a national issue. The fact that the location for Tyson's second post-conviction entry to the UK happens to be Scotland is completely irrelevant. The fact that he is being granted a second entry is not. Women in Scotland who are the victims of violence felt the isolation, impotence, misplaced shame and worthlessness over Tyson's Manchester visit in January, just as much as English women in the same sorry condition. There is no border divide between the betrayal of the fragile trust they might have had in the government, a trust they imagined was going to keep them safe from such triumphant and potent symbols as Tyson has become, of how rape can be survived by the rapist if not by the victim.</p> <p>The dumbing down of Question Time debate is a rather tiresome one. Boy George as an amusing, articulate, one-issue foil to the inarticulate, unamusing, one-issue Brian Souter was rather good TV. Dumbing down can work when it has a point.</p> <p>More interesting is why journalists agree to appear on the programme. Such exposure involves an enormous risk and one wonders why they take it. Many print journalists who never or rarely broadcast, are strange, cowardly, vain little creatures. They spend a great deal of time at home honing their prose to make themselves appear spontaneously witty and analytical. It's always a shock to meet some personality interviewer who has been consistently vindictive to film stars or footballers and to find that this high court judge of human achievement is a greasy haired psychopath with the personality and talent of loft insulation. The delight in reverse, of course, is when good journalists turn to broadcasting and reveal themselves as thoroughly decent coves. Tony Parsons and Alison Pearson come to mind on the sadly missed Late Review. In their case, television merely revealed more of their articulate, intelligent humanity. But when good writers appear on television and shame themselves it's a little heartbreaking. I always secretly admired AA Gill. He is, of course, horribly cruel, but there's a wit that suggests he doesn't really mean it. For instance, his close pal Jeremy Clarkson pretends to be horrid and hate everyone, but is in fact a perfectly lovely man. One hoped Adrian might the same. So to see Gill on Question Time, teeth bared in a perpetual snarl, a silly public school boy's nervous giggle heralding each new piece of ill-informed, populist thinking, and generally being a thoroughly nasty piece of work, was a crushing disappointment. I'm sure to all the people he's been cruel about it was delicious, but to me it was quite awful. Of course, TV can sometimes lie. But do you know what? It doesn't very often.</p> <p>I forced my sister-in-law to get me Charlton Heston's autograph when she worked with him recently. Yes I know he's right-wing monster, but let's face it, the man was El Cid, Ben Hur, even Moses, for heaven's sake. I simply wanted to put the bit of paper in Halliwell's under his name, so future browsers would be impressed when they looked him up. So it's irritating that he's growing ever more beastly as the National Rifle Association's front man and is going to be remembered for being an arse instead of parting the Red Sea. Worse still is my reaction when I read that his gun will only be taken away from \"cold dead hands\". My shame is that despite deploring violence, his invitation strikes me as rather an attractive prospect.</p>",

And what was the message intended by that shot of the two surrounded by little children at a teaparty? Children, however, there will not be. There's only one thing for it. Gordon, get a dog!</p> <p>\u0095Speaking of which, I am shocked to find my so-called rival in the Times reporting that the Barbara Woodhouse de nos jours, Mandy Mandelson, has taken on a second puppy, a playmate for Bobby. This one is called Jack. According to Mandy's people that's because it's a Jack Russell, but in fact of course it is another dangerously amusing Kennedy reference. Rumours abound that Mandy is poised to take on a third puppy, Edward, which he intends to take sailing on the lakes around Hartlepool - a Chappaquiddick reference in very poor taste (although not as poor as the one that goes \"another 98 and he'll have enough for a coat\").</p> <p>\u0095Now that all the dot.com fever has so spectacularly broken, it seems that the reputed national obsession with the internet may also be wavering. At Earls Court yesterday, there were two exhibitions - Internet World 2000, and the other a boring old fair for stamp collectors. I will not insult your intelligence by spelling out which had queues like Madame Tussauds in high summer and which, bless it, looked more like the dome on a quiet day. Perhaps, with the election in mind, Mr T might consider changing that famous pledge, and promise to put a Stanley Gibbons catalogue in every school.</p> <p>\u0095A Broadcasting Standards Commission adjudication reaches us. While accepting comedian Mark Thomas's reputation for \"approaching important issues in an accessible way\", the BSC upholds a complaint on the grounds that \"the tirade against the Rt Hon Robin Cook MP . . . exceeded acceptable boundaries.\" How draconian. All Mark did on his Channel 4 show was highlight the gulf between the hobgoblin's \"ethical dimension at the heart of foreign policy\" and the reality. \"Robin Cook should be here, the f****** evil little corporate knob-polishing, hypocritical lying scum-f****** f***,\" was his conclusion - a little crude, perhaps, but nothing there anyone could seriously argue with. Even so, Mark is penitent, admitting: \"I'd be happy to withdraw 'f****** f***'.\"</p> <p>\u0095Communcations break down yet again with David Yelland. After a recent rebuke over his failure to return calls, the alopecian Sun editor rang to say he never received the message, and that in future we should fax a request for a chat. This we did twice yesterday, hoping to discuss a leader arguing that the entire European economic structure will crumble if Denmark votes against joining Emu - and nothing. God knows why David couldn't respond -apart from his deputy Rebekah Wade replacing Phil Hall as News of the World editor, yesterday was a quiet day at Wapping - but if he could call today perhaps we can thrash the matter out then.</p>",

And what was the message intended by that shot of the two surrounded by little children at a teaparty? Children, however, there will not be. There's only one thing for it. Gordon, get a dog! \u0095Speaking of which, I am shocked to find my so-called rival in the Times reporting that the Barbara Woodhouse de nos jours, Mandy Mandelson, has taken on a second puppy, a playmate for Bobby. This one is called Jack. According to Mandy's people that's because it's a Jack Russell, but in fact of course it is another dangerously amusing Kennedy reference. Rumours abound that Mandy is poised to take on a third puppy, Edward, which he intends to take sailing on the lakes around Hartlepool - a Chappaquiddick reference in very poor taste (although not as poor as the one that goes \"another 98 and he'll have enough for a coat\"). \u0095Now that all the dot.com fever has so spectacularly broken, it seems that the reputed national obsession with the internet may also be wavering. At Earls Court yesterday, there were two exhibitions - Internet World 2000, and the other a boring old fair for stamp collectors. I will not insult your intelligence by spelling out which had queues like Madame Tussauds in high summer and which, bless it, looked more like the dome on a quiet day. Perhaps, with the election in mind, Mr T might consider changing that famous pledge, and promise to put a Stanley Gibbons catalogue in every school. \u0095A Broadcasting Standards Commission adjudication reaches us. While accepting comedian Mark Thomas's reputation for \"approaching important issues in an accessible way\", the BSC upholds a complaint on the grounds that \"the tirade against the Rt Hon Robin Cook MP . . . exceeded acceptable boundaries.\" How draconian. All Mark did on his Channel 4 show was highlight the gulf between the hobgoblin's \"ethical dimension at the heart of foreign policy\" and the reality. \"Robin Cook should be here, the f****** evil little corporate knob-polishing, hypocritical lying scum-f****** f***,\" was his conclusion - a little crude, perhaps, but nothing there anyone could seriously argue with. Even so, Mark is penitent, admitting: \"I'd be happy to withdraw 'f****** f***'.\" \u0095Communcations break down yet again with David Yelland. After a recent rebuke over his failure to return calls, the alopecian Sun editor rang to say he never received the message, and that in future we should fax a request for a chat. This we did twice yesterday, hoping to discuss a leader arguing that the entire European economic structure will crumble if Denmark votes against joining Emu - and nothing. God knows why David couldn't respond -apart from his deputy Rebekah Wade replacing Phil Hall as News of the World editor, yesterday was a quiet day at Wapping - but if he could call today perhaps we can thrash the matter out then.",

Trying to find a key to a prosperous future for the United Kingdom, they have often been impressed by the entrepreneurial buzz surrounding the cluster of hi- tech businesses around the south San Francisco bay, silicon valley. </p> <p>Former trade and industry secretary Peter Mandelson came back convinced that we too could develop the next Microsoft, or Hewlett Packard - if only we could translate the fruit of university research into the next wave of new technology start-up firms. Inspired after his own American tour, Gordon Brown announced a \u00a364m grant for Cambridge to help it pick up entrepreneurial tips from the US, especially the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). </p> <p>But a study out today says there is little chance the UK can become the California of Europe. For a start Californian businesses spend four times as much as the entire UK on research and development. If the UK were an American state, it would roughly be on par with Virginia or Oregon, not known as hotbeds of innovative activity. </p> <p>Commissioned by vice-chancellors for the Whitehall spending review, the report puts paid to the UK's pretensions to be on its way to becoming one of the leading technologically advanced nations. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) figures show the investment gap in research is widening. The Blair government's preoccupation with encouraging academics to be more commercial is misguided. It is in company board rooms that more needs to be done to open minds to new ideas and developments. </p> <p>Aggregate research and development spending in the UK - by government and businesses together - has remained stagnant since the mid-80s. We have the slowest rate of growth in the OECD in R&amp;D spending and the gap between the UK and top OECD performers is increasing every year. </p> <p>In terms of the research budgets of government departments, the UK spends less than half as much as the OECD leaders. This gap is also escalating. And the industrial capacity to exploit research in the UK is weak in comparison to other OECD countries. The table sums up the position on company spending: the UK spends half as much as Sweden and the US per capita on business R&amp;D and the gap is widening. </p> <p>\"The 90s were a lost decade for UK private investment in R&amp;D,\" concludes the report (Talent, not Technology: Publicly Funded Research and Innovation in the UK, available on <a href=\"http://www.sussex.ac.\">www.sussex.ac.</a> uk/spru/index.html). While France and Germany invested inadequately over the same period, each also showed a poor overall economic performance. Other factors help explain their poor performance, such as the integration of the east into Germany and meeting entry conditions for the euro. In the UK, however, 1992-1997 were years of expansion. </p> <p>As for the universities, their research spending per head of population is less than half the amount spent in academic institutions in the United States. The UK has the 16th lowest growth rate in higher education R&amp;D in the OECD. </p> <p>Despite all that, researchers in this country perform well enough. Whatever measurement system is used, the UK is still among the world leaders across different scientific subjects. For example among the OECD countries, UK researchers produced the highest number of publications per millions of pounds of research funding in higher education in 1997. Of 152 recognised fields of research, the UK is a world leader in 26 of them. </p> <p>The number of citations (in scientific journals) per unit of funding is also high in the UK relative to other countries. This may however reflect past investment in university laboratories and infrastructure and the next generation of UK researchers may not be able to sustain this record. What returns does the UK get from this research? We do not know, at least the evidence is patchy, despite the best efforts of the authors of this report, from the science and and technology policy research group at the University of Sussex. Studies find a rate of return falling in the range between 20% and 50% of initial investment. Research does however have identifiable qualitative benefits: increasing the stock of useful knowledge; supplying skilled graduates; enhancing technological problem- solving capacity; creating new instrumentation; generating new firms; and providing new social knowledge. </p> <p>Schemes introduced by the present government have encouraged the exploitation of knowledge produced by the universities - which was highlighted in the 1998 recent competitiveness white paper. But there are limits to the commercial role that uni versities can play. Universities could be more entrepreneurial and in general universities tend to be poor commercial agents. The report suggests that an exaggerated emphasis on promoting university commercialisation is misplaced because it treats universities as a source of technology rather than scientific talent. </p> <p>\"The government needs to be conscious of the limits to commercial exploitation of university research, and should attempt to emulate the best of US practice. Where US universities have been most successful in supporting economic development, they have been allowed the academic freedom to develop and publish new ideas freely and to recruit and retain talented people.\" </p> <p>Lee Elliot-Major is higher education editor for Guardian Unlimited </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:lee.elliot-major@ theguardian.com\">lee.elliot-major@theguardian.com</a></p>",

But a study out today says there is little chance the UK can become the California of Europe. For a start Californian businesses spend four times as much as the entire UK on research and development. If the UK were an American state, it would roughly be on par with Virginia or Oregon, not known as hotbeds of innovative activity. Commissioned by vice-chancellors for the Whitehall spending review, the report puts paid to the UK's pretensions to be on its way to becoming one of the leading technologically advanced nations. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) figures show the investment gap in research is widening. The Blair government's preoccupation with encouraging academics to be more commercial is misguided. It is in company board rooms that more needs to be done to open minds to new ideas and developments. Aggregate research and development spending in the UK - by government and businesses together - has remained stagnant since the mid-80s. We have the slowest rate of growth in the OECD in R&amp;D spending and the gap between the UK and top OECD performers is increasing every year. In terms of the research budgets of government departments, the UK spends less than half as much as the OECD leaders. This gap is also escalating. And the industrial capacity to exploit research in the UK is weak in comparison to other OECD countries. The table sums up the position on company spending: the UK spends half as much as Sweden and the US per capita on business R&amp;D and the gap is widening. \"The 90s were a lost decade for UK private investment in R&amp;D,\" concludes the report (Talent, not Technology: Publicly Funded Research and Innovation in the UK, available on www.sussex.ac. uk/spru/index.html). While France and Germany invested inadequately over the same period, each also showed a poor overall economic performance. Other factors help explain their poor performance, such as the integration of the east into Germany and meeting entry conditions for the euro. In the UK, however, 1992-1997 were years of expansion. As for the universities, their research spending per head of population is less than half the amount spent in academic institutions in the United States. The UK has the 16th lowest growth rate in higher education R&amp;D in the OECD. Despite all that, researchers in this country perform well enough. Whatever measurement system is used, the UK is still among the world leaders across different scientific subjects. For example among the OECD countries, UK researchers produced the highest number of publications per millions of pounds of research funding in higher education in 1997. Of 152 recognised fields of research, the UK is a world leader in 26 of them. The number of citations (in scientific journals) per unit of funding is also high in the UK relative to other countries. This may however reflect past investment in university laboratories and infrastructure and the next generation of UK researchers may not be able to sustain this record. What returns does the UK get from this research? We do not know, at least the evidence is patchy, despite the best efforts of the authors of this report, from the science and and technology policy research group at the University of Sussex. Studies find a rate of return falling in the range between 20% and 50% of initial investment. Research does however have identifiable qualitative benefits: increasing the stock of useful knowledge; supplying skilled graduates; enhancing technological problem- solving capacity; creating new instrumentation; generating new firms; and providing new social knowledge. Schemes introduced by the present government have encouraged the exploitation of knowledge produced by the universities - which was highlighted in the 1998 recent competitiveness white paper. But there are limits to the commercial role that uni versities can play. Universities could be more entrepreneurial and in general universities tend to be poor commercial agents. The report suggests that an exaggerated emphasis on promoting university commercialisation is misplaced because it treats universities as a source of technology rather than scientific talent. \"The government needs to be conscious of the limits to commercial exploitation of university research, and should attempt to emulate the best of US practice. Where US universities have been most successful in supporting economic development, they have been allowed the academic freedom to develop and publish new ideas freely and to recruit and retain talented people.\" Lee Elliot-Major is higher education editor for Guardian Unlimited lee.elliot-major@theguardian.com",

It would be funded from the Microsoft founder's personal \u00a314bn foundation, extending a relatively new scheme already running in the US. As well as significantly raising the profile of Cambridge in the US, the Gates scholarships could also overshadow the prestigious Rhodes scholarships, which attract students to Oxford University. Yesterday a University of Cambridge spokeswoman confirmed that formal discussions with Mr Gates were under way. \"The University of Cambridge has put a proposal to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, proposing that the foundation endows a global scholarship programme,\" she said. \"The proposal would allow Cambridge to offer scholarships to academically talented and promising students who have the potential to be future leaders in their communities and enhance society throughout the world.\" Discussions were continuing, she added.

      "bodyText": "Jack Straw, the home secretary, yesterday won the right to deport a Muslim cleric, Shafiq ur Rehman, in a judgment establishing a new definition of what - and who - constitutes a threat to national security. The court of appeal overturned a ruling by the special immigration appeals commission saying that the threat to national security was primarily for the government to determine and should be broadly defined . But the ruling also means that in future any individual who is considered a threat to any of Britain's \"allies\" - not just Britain itself - could be seized and deported. \"Whatever may have been the position in the past, increasingly the security of one country is dependent upon the security of other countries,\" said Lord Woolf, master of the rolls. He added: \"Here, if there were terrorist activities to which Mr Shafiq ur Rehman was giving encouragement, which were directed against India's links with Kashmir, then the involvement of individuals coming from this country could damage relations between this country and India\". In a ruling which will be seized on by Whitehall as well as by foreign governments seeking the extradition of their militant opponents based in Britain, Lord Woolf continued: \"The promotion of terrorism against any state is capable of being a threat to our own national security\". Lord Woolf, who allowed an appeal to the law lords for a higher ruling on the definition of national security, added: \"In any national security case, the secretary of state is entitled to make a decision to deport not only on the basis that the individual has in fact endangered national security but that he is a danger to national security\". Mr Rehman, the imam of Ross Street mosque in Oldham, was stopped by immigration officials at Manchester airport when he returned from a visit to Pakistan in December 1997. MI5 alleged he was involved in fundraising and recruiting rebels for fighting in Kashmir for the Lashkar Tayyaba Mujahideen group while working in Britain for its political wing, MDI. Mr Rehman, who first came to Britain in 1993, has admitted providing cash for MDI - Centre for Invitation to the Divine Teachings - but has insisted the money was for building schools and hospitals in Pakistan. His counsel, Sibghat Kadri QC, told the three appeal court judges - Lord Woolf, Lord Justice Laws, and Mr Justice Harrison - that their judgment had redefined the meaning of national security. \"Your lordships' decision may have put the clock back, giving carte blanche to the secretary of state to decide what is national security.\" He added: \"This group of people is suffering from Islamaphobia.\" Mr Kadri went on: \"Your lordships seem to be saying that from now on, any non-British citizen must prove they are innocent of posing any threat of damage to Britain.\" Mr Rehman said after yesterday's ruling : \"I am very upset. My case was heard by the commission and I won. \"Now this court has changed the meaning of national security.\" Lord Woolf said that the special commission would redetermine the case, \"applying the approach indicated in our judgment\".",

Mrs Ingham, who is claiming unfair dismissal from her \u00a350,000 a year job, has admitted some abuse of perks and will repay some money, according to the Liverpool Echo yesterday. The charity commission was called in when Sir Phillip Carter, chairman of trustees, asked accountants to examine Mrs Ingham's spending. Sir Philip and the other trustees are criticised for failing properly to manage the charity and Mrs Ingham's spending. During her tenure, the foundation raised millions of pounds and built and equipped a lung cancer research centre in Liverpool. \"I never did anything dishonest, and I am sure the charity commissioners will confirm that,\" Mrs Ingham said.The commission declined to comment until the report had been published.

In a decision that will further strain relations between Europe's biggest \"E\" producer and its neighbours, the Dutch high court has ruled that foreign suspects will be freed unless requests for their extradition include a precise chemical formula for the pills concerned, and the formula matches one banned under Dutch drug laws. \"The problem is that heroin, cocaine and hash or marijuana all have a fixed, internationally-recognised composition.

One such ecstasy variant, 2C.T.2, is potentially lethal but legal in many European countries and sold over the counter in Amsterdam coffee shops. Described as a \"psychedelic amphetamine\", it comes from the family that includes MDMA, the banned ecstasy compound. Even more worryingly, another pill posing as ecstasy, yellow with dark brown flecks but without a trademark logo, was recently found on sale in Holland containing 8mg of the poison strychnine. A Dutch justice ministry spokesman said suspected drug dealers from Germany, Britain and France were currently in Dutch prisons pending extradition hearings. He could not say how many suspects were involved, but Mr Rammelt said he knew of at least two who had been released since the high court's decision. First synthesised in 1912, ecstasy began to be widely used in the US as a recreational drug before being banned there in 1985, and is now outlawed across Europe. Evidence is increasingly emerging that the small white tablets, initially seen as a harmless clubber's pick-me-up with few side-effects, could have disastrous long-term consequences, and even the traditionally liberal Dutch authorities launched a campaign earlier this year telling teenagers that \"one pill can kill\". The drug and its variants can be produced by anyone with rudimentary knowledge of chemistry, using recipes obtained from the internet and a small manually-operated pill-making machine.

One of the 27 rejection slips went as far as to say: \"No one wants to read a book about old men weeping into the telephone.\"</p> <p>But finally Bradley did find a taker and now the book is number three on the New York Times non-fiction list, with 270,000 copies in print.</p> <p>His story of the six young Americans who raised the flag during the 36-day second world war battle in which 22,000 Japanese and 7,000 from the US died has struck something in the public that the publishers did not see.</p> <p>Working with Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Ron Powers, Bradley tells the tale of the six flag-raisers, one of whom was his father, John. Stephen Ambrose, a military historian, says the writers have come up with \"the best battle book I have ever read\".

      "bodyText": "James Bradley's skills as a pots and pans salesman did him no good when it came to hawking his book idea around publishing houses. Flags of Our Fathers, a new volume about Iwo Jima, the battle fought by the US against Japan 55 years ago for a tiny volcanic island in the Pacific, was just what the world did not need. One of the 27 rejection slips went as far as to say: \"No one wants to read a book about old men weeping into the telephone.\" But finally Bradley did find a taker and now the book is number three on the New York Times non-fiction list, with 270,000 copies in print. His story of the six young Americans who raised the flag during the 36-day second world war battle in which 22,000 Japanese and 7,000 from the US died has struck something in the public that the publishers did not see. Working with Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Ron Powers, Bradley tells the tale of the six flag-raisers, one of whom was his father, John. Stephen Ambrose, a military historian, says the writers have come up with \"the best battle book I have ever read\". The New York Times said it was \"one of the most instructive and moving books on war and its aftermath that we are likely to see.\" The photograph of the flag being raised became a symbol for the triumph of the righteous 6,000 miles from the US, a classic moment of grace and danger. Joe Rosenthal's picture pressed all the patriotic buttons but in fact the Associated Press photographer almost failed to press the shutter on his camera because he was talking to a colleague at the time and did not know what he had on film until later. It was reported that the flag was raised on Mount Suribachi under gunfire. Not only was this untrue, but Rosenthal's picture shows a replacement flag going up: the original was removed because an officer wanted it kept as a souvenir. And the image of triumph wrought from endurance was taken on the fifth day, not at the end, of the 36-day battle. But the main purpose of the book is to humanise the six, whose names are long forgotten, although the three survivors were treated, says 46-year-old Bradley, like the Beatles when they came home. The three who didn't make it were Mike Strank, 25, who was probably killed by friendly fire; Harlon Block, 20, a star high school footballer; and Franklin Sousley, 19. The others were marked by what Bradley calls The Photograph and the myths of its making for the rest of their lives. In common with many veterans, John Bradley never talked about Iwo Jima and it was not until his death in 1994 that his family even knew he had won the Navy Cross for bravery. It was in one of three boxes he left behind and the contents of these and interviews with survivors helped Bradley piece together the men's stories and to reveal the nature of his father's courage. \"My breast didn't swell with pride because I understand they were all doing things like that,\" said the author. \"No one would have cooperated with me if I was out to show these guys were unusual heroes. \"What they represent is the best of America, but they were boys of common virtue. My dad just did what he was trained to do but, under fire, when it's observed, it's called heroism.\" Another of the three, Rene Gagnon, died of a heart attack at 54, frustrated that his faded celebrity translated ultimately into no more than work as a janitor. Bradley believes that the final flag-raiser, Ira Hayes, who lived on an Indian reservation in Arizona, never received the help he needed for post-traumatic stress syndrome. He died, 10 years after one of the most famous photographs of the century was taken, from alcohol poisoning.",

      "bodyText": "Bill Gates put capitalism before politics yesterday and joined his long time enemy Bill Clinton in a last-minute appeal to Congress to open up trade with China in a crucial vote that is expected later today. The Microsoft chairman has spent most of the past year fighting the Clinton administration's attempts to break up his giant software business. Today's vote on the administration's China trade bill - which would permanently normalise US-China trade relations - has become the toughest political battle of the year in Congress, with the outcome still uncertain. The intervention by Mr Gates came in the form of an article in yesterday's issue of the Washington Post newspaper under the headline \"Yes, More Trade With China\", which argued that what was good for Microsoft would be good for the US economy. \"With 1.2bn citizens, it's only a matter of time before China's marketplace explodes, providing enormous opportunities for Chinese and US companies as well as businesses around the world,\" Mr Gates wrote. \"What the vote really comes down to is whether the United States is going to join with other major countries in creating open global markets or is going to forgo the opportunity to benefit from a fast-growing Chinese marketplace,\" he added. Today, only 2.5% of the Chinese population own a computer and fewer than 1% have internet access, Mr Gates said, but the numbers were growing \"at an astonishing rate\", with 20m Chinese internet users expected by the end of this year. Responding to critics who say that China's human rights record should preclude normalisation of trade, the Microsoft boss said \"I believe our best opportunity to exert a positive influence in these areas is to do more - not less - to encourage China's position in the global community.\" Mr Clinton went on NBC network news to press the case for the trade bill. \"In China the main people who don't want this to pass are the ultraconservative communists in the military and those who run the state-run industries,\" he said. Most observers believe that the supporters of the bill are winning the upper hand, but both sides acknowledge that the result is too close to call.",

The women were freed from a women's prison in Omdurman, near Khartoum, on Monday, leaving behind 96 inmates. The pardon covers women sentenced by public order courts and does not apply to financial crimes, al-Sahafa said. It said more than 80% of those released were non-Muslims convicted of making or selling alcohol. Reuters, Khartoum Declaration to be sold on web One of 25 known surviving copies of the US Declaration of Independence is expected to fetch up to \u00a34m when it goes up for auction on Sotheby's website on June 29. The document is from the declaration's first printing on July 4-5, 1776. A spokeswoman for Sotheby's said the document, being privately shown in Boston yesterday, will go on public display in Los Angeles and New York in June.

The phones were given free of cost to 32 people, who also included the parliamentary affairs minister, the leader of the opposition in parliament and some officials. The action is seen as a bid to improve the image of the government which has come under fire for squandering public money.

The mayor's place in history was secured by a temple in which he portrayed himself as the king's equal in paintings. His mummified body, mostly deteriorated, was found inside two finely carved sarcophagi, surrounded by amulets. The tomb was to reveal its secrets to the world last night with a visit by a US television crew into the recently unearthed burial chamber.

Contrary to your headline (Blow to anti-hunt campaigners, May 22), we simply state that not enough is known to justify a firm conclusion. Absence of evidence does not mean evidence of absence. However, it is not difficult to see how even the limited amount that is known can be used to justify giving the animal the benefit of the doubt. Prof Patrick Bateson King's College, Cambridge ppgb@cus.cam.ac.uk \u0095 I took Linda Gilroy's private member's bill on fireworks through the Lords and was very interested in David Hencke's article (Firework safety law foiled by pro-hunt plot, May 22).

The Tories took away our link with earnings back in 1980 - that is what we want back.\" Mr Hague plans for pensioners, outlined in a speech to the LSE today, is part of a concerted attempt by the Tories to win back the \"grey vote\", capitalising on anger among pensioners over this year's 75p a week increase in the basic pension. But Mr Jones, a former trade union leader and chairman of the national pensioners convention, said the only policy vote winner would be an immediate restoration of the link with average earnings. He said if the link had never been taken away, the basic pension would now be over \u00a390 instead of \u00a367 and called this year's rise \"derisory\". Mr Hague dismissed as \"gimmicks\" measures such as chancellor Gordon Brown's plan to give free TV licences to the over 75s - arguing that the money which funds them should go straight into pensioners' pockets to spend as they see fit. He outlined how the Tories would redirect into the basic pension the money now used to pay for the \u00a3150 winter fuel allowance, the \u00a310 Christmas bonus, free TV licences and the \u00a313-a-year age addition for the over-80s.

The company made the announcement yesterday as part of its plan to regain public trust after criticism over secrecy and lack of safety. The programme will allow the company to close the older of the two reprocessing works at Sellafield in 2012. The B205 building, as it is called, is 50 years old and is responsible for two-thirds of the radioactive discharges into the Irish Sea which have caused so much anger in Ireland and in the Nordic countries. The timetable of closure, which involves 3,200 jobs, and accounts for 8% of the country's electricity production, has been ordered by BNFL's new chief executive, Norman Askew, who was appointed on March 13 to improve management at the company. The company estimates the closure programme will cost \u00a310bn. Hinkley Point A, opened in 1971, has been in trouble for some time with faulty pipework causing safety concerns. Next to go will be the Bradwell station in two years time, followed by Dungeness A and Sizewell A in 2006 - all being phased out when they reach their 40th anniversaries, twice their original design life. More than 300 people work at each station and many will be kept on after closure for the first three years while the fuel is removed. About 100 will lose their jobs in the first year and remaining posts will be phased down to 50 when the shells of the reactors are put on a \"care and maintenance\" basis. Next to go will be the oldest reactors, Calder Hall and Chapelcross, operated by BNFL for the Ministry of Defence.

The company hopes that this will allow it to keep Oldbury until 2013 and Wylfa until 2016 or even 2021, but it has not yet received permission. The company said all closure dates might be brought forward for safety or commercial reasons. Greenpeace welcomed the Hinkley Point A decision but said all the other stations should also be closed immediately. \"Every day these stations add to the discharges into the Irish Sea, every day they are an accident waiting to happen,\" said Helen Wallace, Greenpeace's nuclear campaigner. The environment agency, which is responsible for the regulation of radioactive discharges from nuclear installations in England and Wales, welcomed the announcement. The closures put the government in some difficulty in meeting its targets for reducing by 20% its carbon dioxide emissions by 2010. At present the emissions are 9% below the 1990 figures because of the switch to gas from coal but they are set to increase as the nuclear stations are shut down.

      "bodyText": "European Union sanctions against Austria could be lifted within weeks if discussions launched by Portugal are successful, it emerged yesterday. Prime minister Antonio Guterres, whose country holds the EU's rotating presidency, said he was consulting fellow leaders about Austria's demand for a speedy end to the controversial measures. In an unprecedented move in February, Austria's 14 EU partners froze bilateral political contacts over concern at the presence in Vienna's new coalition of the far-right Freedom party, then led by J\u00f6rg Haider. But in the clearest signal yet that the isolation of Vienna may be approaching its end, Mr Guterres said he had started \"a range of contacts to define the position [on Austria] at an EU level\". Officials in Copenhagen confirmed last night that the Portuguese leader had spoken to his Danish counterpart, Poul Rasmussen, about ending the boycott. Denmark is one of several countries now pressing hard for the sanctions to end. But diplomats said it was not clear whether agreement could be reached before France assumes the EU presidency at the beginning of July. France, along with Belgium, has adopted a hawkish position on Austria. Both countries fear that their own rightwing extremists will draw encouragement from the rise to power of a like-minded party in another EU member state. \"My view is very simple: there was consensus among the 14 countries [to impose sanctions] and obviously there won't be a change until there is a consensus to do so,\" Mr Guterres said. Austria has expressed the hope that the final summit of the Portuguese presidency, in Oporto next month, may mark the end of the confrontation. Since February, the 14 have boycotted photo sessions, walked out of meetings which were being addressed by Austrian delegates, and refused to shake hands with Austrian representatives. But at an EU meeting in the Azores earlier this month, all 15 foreign ministers, including Austria's, posed for a group photograph in an apparent sign of a slight thaw in relations. Britain's foreign secretary, Robin Cook, suggested then that the 14 consider their \"exit strategy\" and define more precisely what was expected of Austria before the quarantine could end. The Austrian chancellor, Wolfgang Sch\u00fcssel, has been told in general terms that his government must prove its commitment to democracy and human rights before sanctions are lifted. Ireland, Italy, Finland, Spain, Denmark and Greece all favour ending the measures, fearing that the workings of the EU will start to suffer unless relations with Vienna are swiftly normalised. Mr Sch\u00fcssel has warned that he will call a referendum on attitudes towards the union and its treatment of his country if there is no change soon. Mr Haider, notorious for his anti-foreigner rhetoric and controversial remarks about the Nazi period, is no longer leader of the Freedom party. But he has infuriated EU leaders by continuing to launch verbal attacks. He called the French president, Jacques Chirac, a \"pocket-sized Napoleon\" and a \"political failure who doesn't know what he\u00eds talking about.\"",

      "body": "<p>Joe Kinnear will be unveiled as Sheffield Wednesday's new manager today - six months too late, according to Joe Ashton MP. </p> <p>The Wednesday board, facing a vote of no confidence at a forthcoming emergency general meeting, gave Kinnear until yesterday to decide whether to take the job. The 53-year-old former Wimbledon manager has accepted the deal and will be introduced at a press conference this morning. </p> <p>\"If it's true, it's very, very good news,\" said Ashton, one of the \"gang of four\" local MPs who called for Danny Wilson to be sacked late last year. \"I just wish they had signed him on before Christmas when all four MPs suggested it. </p> <p>\"I met Joe Kinnear at an England match, quite by chance, and talked to him then and he was very, very keen. I told all the board and the chairman and I phoned the directors, and I couldn't make any headway.\" </p> <p>Kinnear, who resigned as Wimbledon's manager soon after suffering a mild heart attack at Hillsborough in March last year, still sounds very keen. </p> <p>\"I am delighted and excited to be so close to returning to football at such a big club with what I see as enormous potential,\" he is quoted as telling the club's website. \"There have been some tempting approaches since I left Wimbledon, but Wednesday represents a special challenge.\" </p> <p>Wednesday finally sacked Wilson on March 21, after a 1-0 defeat at Watford. They won successive games in April under Peter Shreeves, but it proved an all too brief revival. They finished five points below the safety line and were relegated along with Watford and Wimbledon. </p> <p>\"Joe Kinnear could make them fight, which they never did,\" Ashton said yesterday. \"The Hillsborough crowd were disgusted to see that Bradford City fought to the last gasp and they survived. Sheffield Wednesday had packed it in by Christmas.\" </p> <p>Kinnear faces a difficult summer.

      "bodyText": "Joe Kinnear will be unveiled as Sheffield Wednesday's new manager today - six months too late, according to Joe Ashton MP. The Wednesday board, facing a vote of no confidence at a forthcoming emergency general meeting, gave Kinnear until yesterday to decide whether to take the job. The 53-year-old former Wimbledon manager has accepted the deal and will be introduced at a press conference this morning. \"If it's true, it's very, very good news,\" said Ashton, one of the \"gang of four\" local MPs who called for Danny Wilson to be sacked late last year. \"I just wish they had signed him on before Christmas when all four MPs suggested it. \"I met Joe Kinnear at an England match, quite by chance, and talked to him then and he was very, very keen. I told all the board and the chairman and I phoned the directors, and I couldn't make any headway.\" Kinnear, who resigned as Wimbledon's manager soon after suffering a mild heart attack at Hillsborough in March last year, still sounds very keen. \"I am delighted and excited to be so close to returning to football at such a big club with what I see as enormous potential,\" he is quoted as telling the club's website. \"There have been some tempting approaches since I left Wimbledon, but Wednesday represents a special challenge.\" Wednesday finally sacked Wilson on March 21, after a 1-0 defeat at Watford. They won successive games in April under Peter Shreeves, but it proved an all too brief revival. They finished five points below the safety line and were relegated along with Watford and Wimbledon. \"Joe Kinnear could make them fight, which they never did,\" Ashton said yesterday. \"The Hillsborough crowd were disgusted to see that Bradford City fought to the last gasp and they survived. Sheffield Wednesday had packed it in by Christmas.\" Kinnear faces a difficult summer. The defenders Peter Atherton, Jon Newsome, Lee Briscoe and Ian Nolan are all out of contract; much of the rest of the team is likely to be up for sale. Wednesday are reported to be about \u00a318m in debt. \"Money is a problem,\" the Wednesday chairman Howard Culley recently admitted. \"The new manager will have to work within a budget and be careful of the players' wage bill which is the most important part of the expenses of the club.\" Kinnear, a former Tottenham and Republic of Ireland full-back, took over as Wimbledon manager in 1992 when they were bottom of the old First Division with 12 games left to play. They finished 13th. His best season was 1996-97, when Wimbledon reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup and League Cup and finished eighth in the Premiership. He has also been manager of Doncaster Rovers, Sharjah and India. \u0095 Gary McAllister, the former Scotland midfielder out of contract at Coventry, has agreed to sign for Liverpool. \u0095 Chelsea have been fined \u00a316,000 by the Football Association for poaching a 12-year-old, Dean Silvester, from Luton Town.",
