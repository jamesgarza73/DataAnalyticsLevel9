No wonder Brandon has such fierce views about biographies: she writes them herself. But rather than concentrate on a single life in great detail, she prefers groups, movements, big themes. </p> <p>The Surrealists are the latest, that group of painters, writers and film-makers who, between the two world wars, invented their own brand of artistic chaos. Queer and quarrelsome, gifted and gauche, they fitted a magic lens into our spectacles which turned the mundane into the bizarre. </p> <p>\"Surreal Lives is an examination of the way art and politics influenced each other between the wars,\" says Brandon. \"It sounds very grandiose, but it opened up all kinds of questions about the way politics influences what people write and paint. And it's about the nature of charisma - why people will follow one person who is a star.\" </p> <p>Andr\u00e9 Breton was the guiding light of the movement. The young poet was a medical auxiliary in Paris in 1917 when he arranged to meet a friend at a tiny Montmartre theatre. It was a momentous evening. The play was by Guillaume Apollinaire, who coined the word \"surrealism\". On stage, a fat woman unbuttoned her blouse to reveal her breasts: two balloons, which she flung at the audience. Breton's friend, witnessing the birth of surreal drama, was Jacques Vach\u00e9. He was confident, cynical, with a black sense of humour; the very opposite of the awkward, earnest Breton. After his early death, his influence on Breton remained mesmerising.</p> <p>With Breton as its core theorist, the movement grew, with Swiss, French and Spanish strands, and with a cast of rampaging egotists - among them Marcel Duchamp, Man Ray, Louis Aragon, Salvador Dali, Tristan Tzara, Louis Bu\u00f1uel. </p> <p>There are countless books on each of them, but Brandon realised there wasn't a collective biography, so she set out to weave the blindingly coloured, separate threads together. She places Breton at the centre: \"Surrealism was his creation, built on his own character and as a reaction to very specific circumstances. He was neurotically homophobic, but he fell in love with Vach\u00e9, building his characteristics into a kind of temple.\" </p> <p>An unruly temple of revolutionary art, in spite of Breton's attempt to lay down rules. Pretty much the position of Brandon herself when she started on the book. With such a wide canvas, verifying every last detail or chasing every survivor wasn't so important. </p> <p>She spent much time at her home, mulling over the many books on the Surrealists and the notes she'd made from archives in Paris, and coming up with a thesis of her own. </p> <p>It was a lonely endeavour at times. Sure, she's got a husband (an academic) and a daughter to care for, but faced with the quiet of her booklined room, \"sometimes I'd ask myself, 'Christ, do I have anything new to say?' And I'd say, 'Yes Ruth, you do. Stick with the theme.' \" </p> <p>For Brandon, feisty, fiftysomething and used to researching a lone furrow, the doubts didn't last long. Others would be daunted, but she thrives on the challenge of constructing an intellectual framework, then cladding it with biographical material to form a book. </p> <p>The formula can be worrying, but so far she has always made it work. A decade ago, she was fascinated by early socialists - Havelock Ellis, Shaw, the Webbs, Wells - and their notions about social and political reform, not least the sexual emancipation of women. </p> <p>Digging among the Fabians, Darwinists and New Lifers, what did she find? \"A huge contradiction between their public and private lives,\" says Brandon. Although females such as Eleanor Marx, Margaret Sanger and Rebecca West were intellectually equal to the men, they allowed themselves (with some exceptions) to be used \"in the more old-fashioned way\" by them. </p> <p>You get the impression that these late-Victorian worthies wouldn't dare treat Brandon in the same way if she'd been in their circle. But how would she have fared as a contemporary of the Surrealists? </p> <p>She has this in common with them: \"I'm a kind of natural anarchist; not very respectful of institutions.\" But that wouldn't have been enough to allow her to enter a movement in which women weren't practitioners. </p> <p>Still, that barrier didn't tempt Brandon to do a demolition job in Surreal Lives. Though critical, she warms to some of them, particularly Bu\u00f1uel the film-maker. \"He's the only one who's a truly great artist. Duchamp was a jokester. He's unquestionably been the most influential, but he copped out. Aragon was a second-rate poet. And Dali, he was self-obsessed and more or less psychotic.\" </p> <p>She has a cold eye for their contradictions. The Surrealists were famous for playing jokes on the public, yet were humourless themselves. They despised the bourgeoisie, but happily accepted them as patrons. Now their work is safely tucked away in the world's great galleries, their revolutionary input spent. Time for Brandon to turn her attention to more dangerous trends: her next theme is the car, and how it changed life in the 20th century.</p>",

A decade ago, she was fascinated by early socialists - Havelock Ellis, Shaw, the Webbs, Wells - and their notions about social and political reform, not least the sexual emancipation of women. Digging among the Fabians, Darwinists and New Lifers, what did she find? \"A huge contradiction between their public and private lives,\" says Brandon. Although females such as Eleanor Marx, Margaret Sanger and Rebecca West were intellectually equal to the men, they allowed themselves (with some exceptions) to be used \"in the more old-fashioned way\" by them. You get the impression that these late-Victorian worthies wouldn't dare treat Brandon in the same way if she'd been in their circle. But how would she have fared as a contemporary of the Surrealists? She has this in common with them: \"I'm a kind of natural anarchist; not very respectful of institutions.\" But that wouldn't have been enough to allow her to enter a movement in which women weren't practitioners. Still, that barrier didn't tempt Brandon to do a demolition job in Surreal Lives. Though critical, she warms to some of them, particularly Bu\u00f1uel the film-maker. \"He's the only one who's a truly great artist. Duchamp was a jokester. He's unquestionably been the most influential, but he copped out. Aragon was a second-rate poet. And Dali, he was self-obsessed and more or less psychotic.\" She has a cold eye for their contradictions. The Surrealists were famous for playing jokes on the public, yet were humourless themselves. They despised the bourgeoisie, but happily accepted them as patrons. Now their work is safely tucked away in the world's great galleries, their revolutionary input spent. Time for Brandon to turn her attention to more dangerous trends: her next theme is the car, and how it changed life in the 20th century.",

Henry Kent is looking for a woman to save him from creeping indigence. On the page, this chiller oozes deliciously along in two voices: his account of his campaign and hers of her gradual slide towards doom. But it needs careful casting, because the performers are effectively playing roles rather than just reading. Here Robert Lindsay's chocolatey young voice is hardly credible for a pensioner rou\u00e9. This might not jar so badly if his character, Kent, did not early on describe Langrish's \"unexpectedly high clear voice that sounded so much younger than it was\". This simply cannot fit Janet Suzman's smoky tones, fabulous though they are. Alas, the mismatch mars this production of a novel that was deservedly acclaimed in print form.",

But, as Peterson puts it, Oakley made the initial decision \"to leave the warlord arsenals intact and to make no concerted attempt to disarm Somalia\".

When Aidid's men were notified of the impending inspection, the message \"this means war\" came back. The Pakistanis were not given that message, and went to their doom with minimal security precautions. Peterson sums it up: \"The result of this American-approved 'inspection' was the largest single-day massacre of UN peace-keeping troops since 1961, when 44 Ghanaians were killed in the Congo.\" </p> <p>The book details how, in early 1994, American pressure to avoid \"another Somalia\" allowed the genocide in Rwanda to continue. The UN force was actually cut back, \"sending a clear message to Rwanda's murderers that they could act with impunity\". But Peterson, a reporter for the Daily Telegraph and photographer with Gamma, Time and Newsweek, has neither the reflective depth nor the golden pen of Philip Gourevitch, whose We Wish to Inform You that Tomorrow We Will be Killed with our Families remains the only bearable book on the genocide. Gourevitch had a secret: he listened to Africans. </p> <p>Peterson attempts to distance himself from the macho, Boy's Own style of journalist usually found in African war zones. But he has brought into his book too many stories of tempers lost on air strips, narrow escapes and bad behaviour for the distance to be convincing. Western journalists, like the UN, have a bad reputation in Africa for arrogance and for not understanding much. This book is not going to change that. </p> <p>However, Christian Jennings's book on war in Rwanda and Burundi makes Peterson's seem restrained and carefully researched. This must surely be a candidate for the worst book ever published by Victor Gollancz. Jennings has filled his pages with the love affairs, diarrhoea attacks and sweating moments of terror of himself and his friends - journalists and aid workers who like plenty of beer, sex and expletives with their Africa.

Lambert's ease with his sexuality, his grateful acceptance of his first sexual liaison with his history master at prep school, contrasts with Lindsay's distress and torment.

Krishnamurti's advice: \"You only free yourself from anxiety when you stop resisting it, and the mind is quiet. The quiet mind is a free mind.\" In turn Gavin tried to introduce Lindsay to these ideas, but he would have none of it.

I seemed to be the only person there who couldn't.\" </p> <p>This was a typical example of Lindsay's stubborn resistance to any sort of interference with his own psyche. He dismissed as \"impractical\" the suggestion that perhaps conflicts in the external world resulted from conflicts within ourselves, and couldn't be settled until we settled our own personal accounts.

It is an escape from memoir; indeed, an escape into privacy. In the very book which might, at first glance, seem most exhibitionist, most shamelessly metropolitan, Amis has softly retreated to the provinces of himself.</p> <p>His book often reads like a letter to his family and closest friends. It is sometimes embarrassing to read; the ordinary reader feels voyeuristic, at times almost uninvited, but very moved. What seems at first just gossip and guestlists - sprays of names offered without explanation, diaristic footnotes, a refusal to universalise - soon becomes a kind of tender defiance, as if Amis wanted the book to vibrate with an atmosphere of wounded privacy. </p> <p>Thus Experience has an undulating, open-ended form, something like a notebook whose pagination has been erased. Obvious chronology is scrambled, so that at any page or two we might move from the mid-1990s back to Amis's earliest childhood days, forward to the 1970s, then forward to the moment at which Amis is writing the book itself, and so on. </p> <p>The book's reminds us that, in an inversion of the usual adage, life is lived backwards but is thought forwards. For we are always thinking forwardly: what next?; yet more often than not what comes next has already been decided by the court of our past, so we must live backwardly. Amis's book is imbued with this sense of the past, especially childhood, as a future already determined. </p> <p>One such determinism - it is the book's major theme - is that innocence will necessarily become experience, song turn to growl. This will happen gradually, as life teaches us its experience. But, as Amis describes it, that change happened savagely and very quickly to him, in 1994 and 1995. These years are the book's pregnable pivot, the wound to which the text recurs again and again.</p> <p>In 1994, Amis learned that his cousin, Lucy Partington, who had disappeared in 1973, was one of Frederick West's victims. He grieved, and grieves, for his cousin, and some of the book's loveliest passages evoke her, and childish holidays spent with her on the beach in Wales. The Partington family were innocence, while the Amises were experience. The Partingtons were from the village, the Amises were from town, and when the families met, \"the lion lay down with the lamb\". (Echoes of Milton and Blake on innocence and experience.) </p> <p>Also around this time, Amis lost an old friend (Julian Barnes), an old agent (Pat Kavanagh), separated from his wife and two children, became horribly famous for his teeth (not, of course, the extraction of a few molars, but the reconstruction of his entire jaw), and lost his father, who died in November, 1995. He also learned that he was the father of a 17-year-old daughter, Delilah Seale, whom he had never met. Amis did not really collapse so much as die into middle age. Innocence had been vandalised. His tears, as the Psalmist has it, had become his meat, day and night. </p> <p>These experiences are wrought in a rich and sedimented prose that displays all of Amis's usual powers of nimble paradox (a chemist that smelled of \"decaying penicillin\", a tennis court strewn with \"shop-fresh garbage\"), with wonderful plumage and peacockery: his head, during toothache, \"TV-shaped with swellings\", or the delicious sentence used to describe his father's stately, plump fall on the Edgware Road: \"It was a work of colossal administration.\"</p> <p>Yet as the book describes Kingsley's last days in hospital, Amis knows how to dilute his tangs, and let a flatter, harder prose report the inevitable: \"How hard it is to die. You have to chase it, panting.\" And finally, this bony epitaph, as Martin looks at his father's corpse: \"It is 1995 and he has been there since 1949.\" What is so moving is the rightful selfishness of those dates: he does not write \"since 1922\", which would be Kingsley's birthdate, but \"since 1949\", which is his own - for his is the reality that now matters. </p> <p>The book's oblique patterns educate us in the ways that the past contains the seeds of its future. For instance, we read of Kingsley Amis's divorce from Martin's mother, and Kingsley's second divorce from Martin's stepmother; we already know, because of the book's switchback form, that Martin's divorce will follow many years later. Likewise, in the course of the book, a daughter is lost (the Partingtons' daughter) and a daughter found (Delilah Seale), and a daughter birthed (his baby daughter with his new wife, Isabel Fonseca). And a father is lost, while a father-substitute (Saul Bellow) is found. And through it all, the fearful symmetry of father and son: one writer begetting another. </p> <p>This layering of incident allows Amis, most beautifully, to touch the hems of his themes without dragging too strongly on them. When, for instance, Martin regrets that he lost touch with his stepmother after her divorce from Kingsley, he laments \"our vanished relatedness, cancelled by law but not by feeling\". Yet that tiny elegy speaks forward too, perhaps, to another, later vanished relatedness, that between Martin and his first wife, Antonia Phillips. There is a sense in which Amis is continually speaking through people to other people in this book, a sun happy to be outshone by their moons. This self-dimming is something new and unexpected in his work, and suggests a new emotional climate. </p> <p>As Nabokov does in his memoir, Speak, Memory, so Amis buries his patterns deep in the aesthetic textures of his book. At one point, he tells us that a local Italian restaurant serves a dish which might be translated as \"from grandmother's handbag\". There is a joke that one might as well fancy \"a plate of hairgrips and DentuFix\". The book has, not surprisingly, established teeth as one of its themes of hardship: there is a funny riff about the indignity of Martin's having to buy Steradent for his dentures. Thus \"Dentufix\". But why \"hairgrips\"?</p> <p>Seventy-four pages later, we learn in a footnote that Lucy Partington's body was found with rope, packing tape, and \"two hairgrips\". So a plate of \"hairgrips and DentuFix\" is, essentially, a plate of experience, a plate of pain. From such painful, painstaking pebbles, such subtleties of detail and implication, is this fine, affecting book built.</p>",

In every age and culture, writers have used language drawn from the natural world - the old, direct words that evoke air, space and light, the mysteries of the elements or the seasons - to express what is inexpressible. The medieval poets, whether they were describing divine ecstasy or the agonies of profane love, chose the image of a garden as their representative metaphor: just as the eye rejoiced at the harmonious beauty of physical place, so would the soul open itself to God, or the heart yield to the beloved. </p> <p>It's as if the dream of a paradise or an Eden simply isn't conceivable without weather, or sunlight, or running water - without a vision of the effortless fecundity of the earth. Both the self-conscious, individualistic art of poetry and the Jungian folk memory that is our collective legacy seem to lead us back to the same lost, idealised space where our most basic needs were once satisfied: the homeland, the village, the garden, the earth. </p> <p>So, broadly, runs the seductive half-truth that is academically teased out for nearly 300 earnest, dogmatic pages by Jonathan Bate in this ecological critique of English literature. Writing from a fashionably talked-up horror at the maimed and polluted state of the natural world, Bate proposes that literature and ecology spring from the same root. Poetry is Green because it's in poetry's nature to be organic, to return us to the things that our more \"cultivated\" selves have lost or forgotten. His book, in his own words, is \"about the capacity of the writer to restore us to the earth which is our home\".</p> <p>Bate is subscribing to a peculiarly modern, essentially agnostic sentimentality. He sets the green, teeming earth, or rather the sheer sensuousness of nature, where religion once stood: at the centre of our moral universe. As he sees it, the human mind turns in extremis not to God, nor to itself, but to its position in the physical order of things - to what Wallace Stevens termed \"actuality\". Clearly, this ignores the nature of the world's large body of metaphysical and mystical poetry. </p> <p>To Plato and Aristotle, or Dante, or John Donne and his successors, or the Sufi mystics, or a Byzantine Greek poet such as Romanos, or W B Yeats or T S Eliot, wisdom was achieved through many kinds of inter-relatedness, many kinds of love, in which a respect for the created world certainly played a part. Yet these poets all reached ultimately beyond the material. They knew that life was a movement forward, an evolution, out of safety and certainty, toward what was desired by the spirit but never completely known. Poetry, for them, was about the soul, and the soul's long journey home to God. </p> <p> The Song Of The Earth is disappointing because it's more a poetic fallacy in critical form than a bona fide critical study. It has little of the shrewd, wide-ranging critical horse-sense of Bate's impressive The Genius Of Shakespeare, and none of the closely argued, revelatory scholarship of his earlier Shakespeare and Ovid. It strains to celebrate the richness of poetic writing while trying, often desperately, to restrict poetry's meaning. Despite the tortuous, jargon-strewn analysis, it doesn't really persuade; it emotes. It wants us to accept, to feel as truth, what is actually an unsustainable eco-political opinion - that literature begins in pastoral, and that the making of poems is (or ought to be) a form of restorative ecological social work. </p> <p>Much of what is wrong or foolish in it can be traced back to an inadequate historical or a false anthropological sense. Bate talks angrily about our \"alienation\", about the greed and rapacity with which we have ransacked the earth's resources, without appreciating that the urge to tame animals, to fish, hunt and cultivate the earth proceeds from the same, common, over-mastering human need. It's in our nature - not the result of some later corruption, or fall from grace - to dam the river, to fell the forest, to take the lamb from the sheep, the egg from the bird. </p> <p>Poetry is not naturally part of nature, nor is it naturally passive. It belongs to the life of the world, because it's part of the life of the world. Its struggle is violent, tarnished, social and human; life-taking as well as life-giving. As Peter Conrad wrote definitively in his Everyman History of English Literature, \"In the beginning is the epic. Literature begins there. It caters to the first human need, for it is the poem of force, the poem as force...\" </p> <p>Bate's thinking is flawed by anachronism. He is nostalgic, as only a wistful contemporary urbanite can be, for a natural world that, Camelot-like, never was but should have been. This must be why so many of the poems and books he discusses - from Rousseau and Frankenstein to Elizabeth Bishop and Les Murray - were written after the 18th-century Age of Enlightenment had taken some old imaginative magic out of the landscape and purged the earth of its primitive superstitious enchantment. Poetry has been trying, ever since, to put it back. </p> <p>It must also be why he can take seriously the work of a philosopher like Martin Heidegger, whose wish-fulfilling Late Romantic notions of the sacredness of \"home\" and \"the earth\" in reality helped the Nazis to create for Germany a bogus Bavarian pre-history - clean, blond, healthy, Aryan - that became, briefly, a living, terrifying lie. Bate quotes the literary theorist Paul de Man who asks, \"What is the pastoral convention, then, if not the eternal separation between the mind that distinguishes, negates, legislates and the original simplicity of the natural?\"</p> <p>In his hatred of alienation, Bate fails to see that human beings were technological from the beginning, because their minds were technological. So, too, is nature itself. As quantum physics has amply demonstrated, there is no \"original simplicity\". </p> <p>At its worst, The Song Of The Earth is an absurd book, written in a style often wretchedly close to academic self-parody, and tailor-made for the politically correct, historically ignorant, second-generation flower children of the dumbed-down modern campus. </p> <p>Yet in it, and for all his infuriating archness of tone, Bate is also trying to do something courageous and far-sighted. His best chapter is an excellent, tautly detailed analysis of four individual poems: Byron's \"Darkness\", Keats's \"To Autumn\", Coleridge's \"Frost at Midnight\" and Wallace Stevens's \"Sunday Morning\". Here, detaching himself a little from the tangle of his relentless eco-theorising, he is able to write about language with a rare, deep-reaching critical insight, searching beneath the skein of words for the essential loneliness of soul which lends to all poetry its unmistakable note of yearning. He is arguing, if only he could see it, not for ecology or \"the earth\" but for a redeeming sense of natural beauty.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Song Of The Earth Jonathan Bate Picador, \u00a318, 322pp Buy it at BOL Literature has always had a pastoral side, a garden spot. In every age and culture, writers have used language drawn from the natural world - the old, direct words that evoke air, space and light, the mysteries of the elements or the seasons - to express what is inexpressible. The medieval poets, whether they were describing divine ecstasy or the agonies of profane love, chose the image of a garden as their representative metaphor: just as the eye rejoiced at the harmonious beauty of physical place, so would the soul open itself to God, or the heart yield to the beloved. It's as if the dream of a paradise or an Eden simply isn't conceivable without weather, or sunlight, or running water - without a vision of the effortless fecundity of the earth. Both the self-conscious, individualistic art of poetry and the Jungian folk memory that is our collective legacy seem to lead us back to the same lost, idealised space where our most basic needs were once satisfied: the homeland, the village, the garden, the earth. So, broadly, runs the seductive half-truth that is academically teased out for nearly 300 earnest, dogmatic pages by Jonathan Bate in this ecological critique of English literature. Writing from a fashionably talked-up horror at the maimed and polluted state of the natural world, Bate proposes that literature and ecology spring from the same root. Poetry is Green because it's in poetry's nature to be organic, to return us to the things that our more \"cultivated\" selves have lost or forgotten. His book, in his own words, is \"about the capacity of the writer to restore us to the earth which is our home\". Bate is subscribing to a peculiarly modern, essentially agnostic sentimentality. He sets the green, teeming earth, or rather the sheer sensuousness of nature, where religion once stood: at the centre of our moral universe. As he sees it, the human mind turns in extremis not to God, nor to itself, but to its position in the physical order of things - to what Wallace Stevens termed \"actuality\". Clearly, this ignores the nature of the world's large body of metaphysical and mystical poetry. To Plato and Aristotle, or Dante, or John Donne and his successors, or the Sufi mystics, or a Byzantine Greek poet such as Romanos, or W B Yeats or T S Eliot, wisdom was achieved through many kinds of inter-relatedness, many kinds of love, in which a respect for the created world certainly played a part. Yet these poets all reached ultimately beyond the material. They knew that life was a movement forward, an evolution, out of safety and certainty, toward what was desired by the spirit but never completely known. Poetry, for them, was about the soul, and the soul's long journey home to God. The Song Of The Earth is disappointing because it's more a poetic fallacy in critical form than a bona fide critical study. It has little of the shrewd, wide-ranging critical horse-sense of Bate's impressive The Genius Of Shakespeare, and none of the closely argued, revelatory scholarship of his earlier Shakespeare and Ovid. It strains to celebrate the richness of poetic writing while trying, often desperately, to restrict poetry's meaning. Despite the tortuous, jargon-strewn analysis, it doesn't really persuade; it emotes. It wants us to accept, to feel as truth, what is actually an unsustainable eco-political opinion - that literature begins in pastoral, and that the making of poems is (or ought to be) a form of restorative ecological social work. Much of what is wrong or foolish in it can be traced back to an inadequate historical or a false anthropological sense. Bate talks angrily about our \"alienation\", about the greed and rapacity with which we have ransacked the earth's resources, without appreciating that the urge to tame animals, to fish, hunt and cultivate the earth proceeds from the same, common, over-mastering human need. It's in our nature - not the result of some later corruption, or fall from grace - to dam the river, to fell the forest, to take the lamb from the sheep, the egg from the bird. Poetry is not naturally part of nature, nor is it naturally passive. It belongs to the life of the world, because it's part of the life of the world. Its struggle is violent, tarnished, social and human; life-taking as well as life-giving. As Peter Conrad wrote definitively in his Everyman History of English Literature, \"In the beginning is the epic. Literature begins there. It caters to the first human need, for it is the poem of force, the poem as force...\" Bate's thinking is flawed by anachronism. He is nostalgic, as only a wistful contemporary urbanite can be, for a natural world that, Camelot-like, never was but should have been. This must be why so many of the poems and books he discusses - from Rousseau and Frankenstein to Elizabeth Bishop and Les Murray - were written after the 18th-century Age of Enlightenment had taken some old imaginative magic out of the landscape and purged the earth of its primitive superstitious enchantment. Poetry has been trying, ever since, to put it back. It must also be why he can take seriously the work of a philosopher like Martin Heidegger, whose wish-fulfilling Late Romantic notions of the sacredness of \"home\" and \"the earth\" in reality helped the Nazis to create for Germany a bogus Bavarian pre-history - clean, blond, healthy, Aryan - that became, briefly, a living, terrifying lie. Bate quotes the literary theorist Paul de Man who asks, \"What is the pastoral convention, then, if not the eternal separation between the mind that distinguishes, negates, legislates and the original simplicity of the natural?\" In his hatred of alienation, Bate fails to see that human beings were technological from the beginning, because their minds were technological. So, too, is nature itself. As quantum physics has amply demonstrated, there is no \"original simplicity\". At its worst, The Song Of The Earth is an absurd book, written in a style often wretchedly close to academic self-parody, and tailor-made for the politically correct, historically ignorant, second-generation flower children of the dumbed-down modern campus. Yet in it, and for all his infuriating archness of tone, Bate is also trying to do something courageous and far-sighted. His best chapter is an excellent, tautly detailed analysis of four individual poems: Byron's \"Darkness\", Keats's \"To Autumn\", Coleridge's \"Frost at Midnight\" and Wallace Stevens's \"Sunday Morning\". Here, detaching himself a little from the tangle of his relentless eco-theorising, he is able to write about language with a rare, deep-reaching critical insight, searching beneath the skein of words for the essential loneliness of soul which lends to all poetry its unmistakable note of yearning. He is arguing, if only he could see it, not for ecology or \"the earth\" but for a redeeming sense of natural beauty.",

And, surely, few men are so lovable that their ex-wives will let them spend their dotage in a granny flat beneath their new marital home, as Kingsley's first wife did; I remember a friend of mine's mother asking the Kilmarnocks to dinner at some point in the 80s, to which Lady K replied: \"We'd love to, so long as we can get a baby-sitter for Kingsley.\" </p> <p>But it is in the end Larkin, not Hilly or Jane, whose long shadow looms over the book like a post-coital conqueror; the mourner at every Whitsun wedding and the bridegroom at every funeral. This is a long book, and the private baby-talk between Amis and Larkin pales quite early on; it feels indecent to linger over it too long, like accidentally hearing a couple you vaguely know having sex in the next room. The streak of melancholy that runs through Amis's life does, in the end, seem to stem from the fact that his heterosexuality was something of a curse to him, the way homosexuality traditionally was to others; \"I wish we lived in the same town,\" he writes to Larkin as early as 1949, \"one of the ways in which I feel I am wasting my youth is in not seeing you much more often dalling.\" </p> <p>Who knows, if he'd been born in Martin's time, he might have been able to follow his heart and let it all \"hang out,\" as they say. But then it is doubtful whether he would have left us such a ceaselessly fresh and adorable body of work, from Take A Girl Like You up to The Old Devils - a quarter-century of exasperation made poetry.

James Kerr's production approaches George Farquhar's 1706 play about military officers attempting to enlist recruits as if it were a dirge, not a comedy. Tanya McCallin's plain set looks beautiful in Tom Mannings' atmospheric lighting, but its blank nothingness is part of the void at the heart of this dispiriting production.</p> <p>Farquhar's roll of wide-eyed country folk, lovelorn heiresses and sergeants and contsables with an eye to the main chance, scamper across the stage but seldom leave much impression. Only Natalie Walter's Rose, a girl well aware of her charms and ready to capitalise upon them, Nicholas Le Prevost's blustering Captain Brazen and Nicholas Tennant's Sergeant Kite, a decent man corrupted by his calling, give any sense of fully rounded characters.</p> <p>Part of the problem with Kerr's production is that it fails to provide any real social or financial context: the play appears to take place in some burnished no man's land rather than the small Shropshire town with its distinct social hierarchy that Farquhar specifies. You need to know of the social and financial gulfs between the would-be lovers to understand why Silvia disguises herself as a boy to test Plume and why Melinda is so wary of Worthy's suit.</p> <p>The detailed depiction of army life is rather more successful, particularly in the relationships between the soldiers. But it is hard to sit through this dreary three hours when the payback in terms of laughs is so paltry. It is not an experience that will win any recruits either for Farquhar or the Festival theatre.</p>",

James Kerr's production approaches George Farquhar's 1706 play about military officers attempting to enlist recruits as if it were a dirge, not a comedy. Tanya McCallin's plain set looks beautiful in Tom Mannings' atmospheric lighting, but its blank nothingness is part of the void at the heart of this dispiriting production. Farquhar's roll of wide-eyed country folk, lovelorn heiresses and sergeants and contsables with an eye to the main chance, scamper across the stage but seldom leave much impression. Only Natalie Walter's Rose, a girl well aware of her charms and ready to capitalise upon them, Nicholas Le Prevost's blustering Captain Brazen and Nicholas Tennant's Sergeant Kite, a decent man corrupted by his calling, give any sense of fully rounded characters. Part of the problem with Kerr's production is that it fails to provide any real social or financial context: the play appears to take place in some burnished no man's land rather than the small Shropshire town with its distinct social hierarchy that Farquhar specifies. You need to know of the social and financial gulfs between the would-be lovers to understand why Silvia disguises herself as a boy to test Plume and why Melinda is so wary of Worthy's suit. The detailed depiction of army life is rather more successful, particularly in the relationships between the soldiers. But it is hard to sit through this dreary three hours when the payback in terms of laughs is so paltry. It is not an experience that will win any recruits either for Farquhar or the Festival theatre.",

I thought I missed a great opportunity when my mother wouldn't sign the papers allowing me to travel.\" So there she sat in a Liverpool dole office for eight years. It was a very soft system, both for the dole dodgers and those building up their pension rights, she says. \"I kept saying to myself this is not for me.\" About this time she spotted an advertisement in the Liverpool Echo for telephone salespeople. \"It sounded interesting,\" she says.

The local Alliance &amp; Leicester offered a 10am to 2pm shift that \"was perfect for a work ing mother\". Within two weeks, the event that shaped her future hit the Ewen household.

She embarked on a part-time course and completed six years, by which time she had to gain work experience for the second part of her qualifications. She hawked herself around several law offices without success. \"I wasn't put off,\" she says, \"Because I felt I was good.\" This upbeat attitude paid off with another break. A friend had got a job as re ceptionist at Liverpool-based law firm Silverbeck Rymer and told Jim Rymer about the student mother.

Perhaps because you can listen and log on at the same time, or perhaps because web radio is taking the medium into the technological future, radio, it is accepted, is here to stay. </p> <p>Unfortunately, that does not mean that jobs abound. Journalism has always been a difficult profession to break into, and although radio is expanding in some ways, it is consolidating in others. </p> <p>Will Baynes, secretary of the Broadcast Journalism Training Council, says: \"One of my jobs is to place students on our recognised courses into work experience positions. But stations which took people last year, when I call them this year, say they no longer have anyone available to supervise a placement. </p> <p>\"With so many commercial stations coming under one management jobs are being cut to increase revenues and, unfortunately, the first to go are in the newsroom,\" he says. </p> <p>But, with persistence, a radio journalism job is possible.

Perhaps because you can listen and log on at the same time, or perhaps because web radio is taking the medium into the technological future, radio, it is accepted, is here to stay. Unfortunately, that does not mean that jobs abound. Journalism has always been a difficult profession to break into, and although radio is expanding in some ways, it is consolidating in others. Will Baynes, secretary of the Broadcast Journalism Training Council, says: \"One of my jobs is to place students on our recognised courses into work experience positions. But stations which took people last year, when I call them this year, say they no longer have anyone available to supervise a placement. \"With so many commercial stations coming under one management jobs are being cut to increase revenues and, unfortunately, the first to go are in the newsroom,\" he says.

      "body": "<p>Sportsmen in their prime do not countenance failure. Like a child in a school play who has no fear of forgetting lines or feeling embarrassed wearing a silly costume, Faldo, Borg and Beckenbauer in their pomp were never stage-struck. </p> <p>And for some inexplicable reason, four men from Galatasaray were blessed with this overwhelming confidence in Copenhagen on Wednesday evening, whereas two men from Arsenal (via Croatia and France) succumbed to sport's cruellest humiliation. Davor Suker and Patrick Vieira, world-class performers, were reduced to shambling wrecks when wearing an English club shirt. </p> <p>Glenn Hoddle described England's inability to kick a ball from 12 yards into a goal measuring eight yards by eight feet as a \"disease\" and gave it as an excuse for not practising penalties a great deal in preparation for France 98. His successor as coach of the England team, Kevin Keegan, spoke last week about being unable to \"recreate the same conditions\" on the training field. </p> <p>Something mysterious is going on here. We had Chris Waddle and Stuart Pearce against Germany in Italia 90, we had Gareth Southgate in Euro 96 and then David Batty in the last World Cup. Why do we keep failing in these shoot-outs? </p> <p>Some will point to a deficiency in our mental make-up; others will insist that we simply don't practise enough. </p> <p>Hoddle said after Batty's failure against Argentina: \"I'm not denying practice does help, but a golfer can practise 1,000 putts on the putting green and he can then go out on the last day of a tournament when there's a big crowd and miss. If it was all down to practice then it would be a simple scenario.\" </p> <p>But surely practice helps boost confidence and gives those poor souls who are confronted with a shoot-out enough mental images of past successes to carry with them during that long walk from the halfway line. </p> <p>You only have to witness the amount of time Zola puts in at the Chelsea training ground to see how those wonderful bending free-kicks he delivers are not a result of natural ability alone. A repetitive routine of taking dozens a day helps fine-tune his natural gifts. </p> <p>Whether it's taking penalties, serving with consistent accuracy at 120mph, tapping a ball into a cup from six inches, or indeed sitting a maths test, if you are crippled with tension you are doomed. </p> <p>The golf commentator Peter Alliss described this overpowering tension when he suffered from a career-threatening attack of the yips. </p> <p>\"I stood over the ball, lining up the putt,\" he told me, \"and suddenly I was gripped by negative thoughts. I couldn't visualise the ball going in. I was frightened of failure and I could barely draw back the putter to make contact with the ball.\" </p> <p>Fifa's president Sepp Blatter, head of the game's world governing body, isn't a fan of penalty shoot-outs, suggesting that this do-or-die solution, fit more for the Colosseum than a soccer stadium, promotes \"individualism\" in the game and causes great \"trauma\" to the players. </p> <p>Perhaps what he is forgetting is that shoot-outs provide unforgettable moments of drama and tension for the spectator. </p> <p>It's the nearest thing to a gladiatorial fight to the death that the civilised world can conjure. At boxing big nights, movie stars pay thousands to sit at ringside for a world heavyweight championship to hear the groans, to smell the fear and to get a splash of blood on their tuxedos. </p> <p>Wednesday evening's Uefa Cup final was pretty turgid for 90 minutes and wasn't a lot better during extra-time, where the golden-goal rule was in operation.

      "bodyText": "Sportsmen in their prime do not countenance failure. Like a child in a school play who has no fear of forgetting lines or feeling embarrassed wearing a silly costume, Faldo, Borg and Beckenbauer in their pomp were never stage-struck. And for some inexplicable reason, four men from Galatasaray were blessed with this overwhelming confidence in Copenhagen on Wednesday evening, whereas two men from Arsenal (via Croatia and France) succumbed to sport's cruellest humiliation. Davor Suker and Patrick Vieira, world-class performers, were reduced to shambling wrecks when wearing an English club shirt. Glenn Hoddle described England's inability to kick a ball from 12 yards into a goal measuring eight yards by eight feet as a \"disease\" and gave it as an excuse for not practising penalties a great deal in preparation for France 98. His successor as coach of the England team, Kevin Keegan, spoke last week about being unable to \"recreate the same conditions\" on the training field. Something mysterious is going on here. We had Chris Waddle and Stuart Pearce against Germany in Italia 90, we had Gareth Southgate in Euro 96 and then David Batty in the last World Cup. Why do we keep failing in these shoot-outs? Some will point to a deficiency in our mental make-up; others will insist that we simply don't practise enough. Hoddle said after Batty's failure against Argentina: \"I'm not denying practice does help, but a golfer can practise 1,000 putts on the putting green and he can then go out on the last day of a tournament when there's a big crowd and miss. If it was all down to practice then it would be a simple scenario.\" But surely practice helps boost confidence and gives those poor souls who are confronted with a shoot-out enough mental images of past successes to carry with them during that long walk from the halfway line. You only have to witness the amount of time Zola puts in at the Chelsea training ground to see how those wonderful bending free-kicks he delivers are not a result of natural ability alone. A repetitive routine of taking dozens a day helps fine-tune his natural gifts. Whether it's taking penalties, serving with consistent accuracy at 120mph, tapping a ball into a cup from six inches, or indeed sitting a maths test, if you are crippled with tension you are doomed. The golf commentator Peter Alliss described this overpowering tension when he suffered from a career-threatening attack of the yips. \"I stood over the ball, lining up the putt,\" he told me, \"and suddenly I was gripped by negative thoughts. I couldn't visualise the ball going in. I was frightened of failure and I could barely draw back the putter to make contact with the ball.\" Fifa's president Sepp Blatter, head of the game's world governing body, isn't a fan of penalty shoot-outs, suggesting that this do-or-die solution, fit more for the Colosseum than a soccer stadium, promotes \"individualism\" in the game and causes great \"trauma\" to the players. Perhaps what he is forgetting is that shoot-outs provide unforgettable moments of drama and tension for the spectator. It's the nearest thing to a gladiatorial fight to the death that the civilised world can conjure. At boxing big nights, movie stars pay thousands to sit at ringside for a world heavyweight championship to hear the groans, to smell the fear and to get a splash of blood on their tuxedos. Wednesday evening's Uefa Cup final was pretty turgid for 90 minutes and wasn't a lot better during extra-time, where the golden-goal rule was in operation. The best bit was the shoot-out. There appears to be no rational alternative to the shoot-out, other than to employ a complex series of solutions based on the number of corner kicks, the number of yellow cards or the number of genuine attempts at goal. They could, I suppose, add up the collective wealth of the players (which England would usually win) or give marks out of 10 for the better turned-out team, but that would be unfair on the Albanians. No, we are simply stuck with this kick to the death. And it just means that our players are going to have to get over this psychological hurdle. Either that or they damn well take their chances during open play.",

He is not content to accept a cameo role, which has as much to do with his age as his ego, though he still believes in his own talents. He says: \"I may be almost 34 but I am still very competitive. I always have things to prove. The day I don't feel that I have anything to prove to anyone I will probably stop playing.\" He has little to prove to Vialli, the Chelsea fans or the football world at large. And at Chelsea, he says, he has had the happiest days of his life. Both because of a style of football that has remained sexy long after the departure of Ruud Gullit and because of a privacy unknown in Italy or the Beckham household, which has allowed him to smell the flowers along the way. He does not yet know whether he will play any part in tomorrow's final against Aston Villa. But it is certain that Vialli, who also embraces the concept that there is a correct way of doing things, will not replicate the treatment he received from Gullit in the 1997 final against Middlesbrough. Vialli, who for months was ignored by his former friend Gullit on and off the training field having lost his place in the team, was left sitting on the Wembley bench for 88 minutes. When he was finally brought on, ironically for Zola, it seemed to be almost a deliberate act of humiliation by Gullit. Even if Vialli cannot find a starting place for Zola tomorrow, one suspects he will give him a decent run. A chance to milk the applause and say his farewell to Chelsea fans if it is his final game. A chance, as Zola himself might say, to close out a season and a phase of his life in the proper manner.",

Amid several showers - and one burst of hail - England closed on 175 for 3 and lead Zimbabwe by 92 runs. Graeme Hick, playing his first Test innings against his former countrymen, was unbeaten on 62, with Alec Stewart not out 14. </p> <p>Play began an hour late after some early rain in London, but Mike Atherton was soon into his stride, square-cutting the left-arm medium pace of Bryan Strang for four, before going down on one knee to launch the same bowler to the cover boundary. But Zimbabwe struck back when Nasser Hussain, who had already taken successive boundaries off Strang (through mid-off, then through the covers), drove hard at Heath Streak and was well taken by Bryan Murphy at cover point above his head. Hussain had made 10, and England were 49 for 2. </p> <p>Hick joined Atherton and didn't take long to tuck into Zimbabwe's bowling, which looked innocuous when Streak wasn't charging in from the pavilion end. Hick pulled Neil Johnson for a cracking four, and brought up England's hundred by repeating the shot against Guy Whittall, whom he square-cut for another boundary next ball. </p> <p>Atherton reached fifty with a scurried single into the covers, but fell shortly after when Streak trapped him leg before for 55 - even if replays showed that Atherton had got an inside edge.</p> <p>But from 113 for 3, England were troubled only by the weather as Hick moved up a gear. Strang suffered most: first Hick square-cut him powerfully for four, then played a delightful late-cut for three next ball before smashing Strang through the covers for four more. He got to a fine fifty with yet another cover-driven boundary, again off Strang, whose lack of pace gave him little margin for error.</p> <p>The players went off for bad light at 5.11pm, re-emerged at 5.40 and trotted off again five minutes later, much to the annoyance of the crowd. When they came out for one final go at 6.35, with the score on 160 for 3, Hick was immediately put down by Andy Flower behind the stumps as he edged a nothing drive at Johnson. The ball ran away for four. It was Flower's second bad miss after dropping Mark Ramprakash yesterday evening off an even simpler chance. Who knows how much events in Zimbabwe are playing on his mind.</p> <p>But England survived until the close, and are now in a formidable position. Their only problem might be the weather. More showers are forecast for tomorrow - it could be another frustrating day.</p> <p> <em>Lawrence Booth is assistant editor of wisden.com</em></p>",

Graeme Hick, playing his first Test innings against his former countrymen, was unbeaten on 62, with Alec Stewart not out 14. Play began an hour late after some early rain in London, but Mike Atherton was soon into his stride, square-cutting the left-arm medium pace of Bryan Strang for four, before going down on one knee to launch the same bowler to the cover boundary. But Zimbabwe struck back when Nasser Hussain, who had already taken successive boundaries off Strang (through mid-off, then through the covers), drove hard at Heath Streak and was well taken by Bryan Murphy at cover point above his head. Hussain had made 10, and England were 49 for 2. Hick joined Atherton and didn't take long to tuck into Zimbabwe's bowling, which looked innocuous when Streak wasn't charging in from the pavilion end. Hick pulled Neil Johnson for a cracking four, and brought up England's hundred by repeating the shot against Guy Whittall, whom he square-cut for another boundary next ball. Atherton reached fifty with a scurried single into the covers, but fell shortly after when Streak trapped him leg before for 55 - even if replays showed that Atherton had got an inside edge. But from 113 for 3, England were troubled only by the weather as Hick moved up a gear. Strang suffered most: first Hick square-cut him powerfully for four, then played a delightful late-cut for three next ball before smashing Strang through the covers for four more. He got to a fine fifty with yet another cover-driven boundary, again off Strang, whose lack of pace gave him little margin for error. The players went off for bad light at 5.11pm, re-emerged at 5.40 and trotted off again five minutes later, much to the annoyance of the crowd. When they came out for one final go at 6.35, with the score on 160 for 3, Hick was immediately put down by Andy Flower behind the stumps as he edged a nothing drive at Johnson. The ball ran away for four. It was Flower's second bad miss after dropping Mark Ramprakash yesterday evening off an even simpler chance. Who knows how much events in Zimbabwe are playing on his mind. But England survived until the close, and are now in a formidable position. Their only problem might be the weather. More showers are forecast for tomorrow - it could be another frustrating day.

Trouble started when Kevin Storey, 33, of Grantham, Lincolnshire, was driving down the M3 on his way to a christening in Poole. Just outside Winchester he was signalled to pull over onto the hard shoulder by a police patrol car. Since he was at the time doing 68mph in a zone restricted to 50mph he feared that he was about to receive a speeding ticket. The officer concerned, however, was less interested by Mr Storey's speed than the fact that he had been driving whilst eating a two-fingered chocolate KitKat. Although the KitKat had actually been unwrapped by Mr Storey's wife, it nonetheless presented a serious hazard to other road users, explained the officer, since the mouth-watering combination of crisp crunchy wafer and rich milk chocolate could distract his attention from the motorway ahead. He was duly cautioned and issued with a \u00a320 on-the-spot fine, although this was later withdrawn on appeal. \"We accept that in this case our patrolmen was a little over-zealous,\" admitted a police spokesman. \"KitKats aren't, in themselves, a significant threat to law and order.

Des McAllister, of Kilmun, was weeding his herbaceous borders when he noticed the stricken bird bobbing around in the fast-flowing River Echaig. Realising it was in trouble he stripped to his underpants, waded out into the river and brought it back to shore. It was showing no signs of life, and so whilst his wife called the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, Mr McAllister began giving it mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. \"I'd never done anything like it before,\" he explained. \"But it was a shame to see such a beautiful bird in such a pathetic state.\" Amazingly, after just a few gentle breaths into the creature's nostrils, it regained consciousness, and, after flapping its wings and hissing for a while, duly flew off over the treetops. \"I saw him straddling a bird in his underpants,\" recalled one neighbour, \"Kissing its beak and shouting 'Come on!

And this is also why I won't work the late shift any more and the queues in the early hours will get longer and longer. Name and Address Supplied The Bath Chronicle",

      "body": "<p>Back in the very early 80s, before Reclaim The Streets was even thought of, an awesome number of Ford Capris up and down the country developed mysterious dents on their bonnets. There was also a rash of cases of cars having their front windows smashed, but with no evidence of any attempts at theft. These acts of auto destruction were not the work of proto anti-car anarchists or even bored thugs, but overenthusiastic pre-teens living out a fantasy of being Saturday teatime television's most amenable heroes: Bo and Luke from The Dukes Of Hazzard. The Ford Capri, suburban Britain's own answer to the revved-up muscle cars that America produced in the late 60s, was the unfortunate victim of the kids' belief that it looked a bit like the General Lee, Bo and Luke's Yankee-defying 1968 Dodge Charger. The Dukes Of Hazzard had achieved that ultimate mark of success: creating a societal crisis.</p> <p>It didn't stop there. While their younger sisters fought over who was to play at being Daisy Duke, the big boys attached \"dixie\" horns to their cars and engaged in high-street chases with police pandas through the streets of Basildon. There were even rumours of young men checking into A&amp;E with ruptured testicles after attempting to go for that authentic Bo'n'Luke bulge with the aid of unnaturally tight jeans.</p> <p>Now they're back in Hazzard In Hollywood, which opened in the US this week. Incredibly, they are also enjoying something of a fashion moment. \"It's Daisy Duke, really,\" says stylist Jane Stevenson. \"What most people remember her for is really short, running-up-the-arse hotpants, as much cleavage as possible, and skintight jeans, and pretty much every designer has done that look for this summer.\"</p> <p>In America, hotpants were even renamed Daisy Dukes in her honour. Ralph Lauren, Chloe and Louis Vuitton have all included Daisy Dukes in their new collections. \"Her bronzed skintone and long wavy hair is also very in at the moment - everyone is trying to re-create it with lots of fake tan,\" adds Stevenson. \"It's basically an American, late-70s/early-80s look that developed from Charlie's Angels.\"</p> <p>Bo and Luke, meanwhile, were classic 70s studs: tight jeans, unbuttoned shirts, and big, dusty cowboy boots. \"Daisy Duke was every boy's wet dream and every girl's wannabe, but Bo and Luke were super-sexy too,\" says Stevenson. \"Faded, worn-in jeans, bulging crotches, and an amazing ability to leap in and out of car windows. What more could you ask for?\"</p> <p>What more, indeed. Bo, Luke and Daisy Duke were true American heroes. In proper hillbilly fashion, they were all cousins, appeared to be lacking parents, and were looked after by the kindly Uncle Jesse, a grits-eating grandpaw in a babygrow who was in continual battle to defend his farmland against the evil Boss Hogg, Hazzard County's bigwig and the Dukes' number one enemy. </p> <p>The degenerate, stogy-chewing, belt-stretching Hogg, who wore a white three-piece suit and drove a suspiciously clean white stretch Cadillac, disliked the fact that the Duke boys were always poking their nose into his dubious business ventures, and stopped at nothing to get his lackey, the local sheriff Rosco P Coltrane, to arrest them.</p> <p>Rosco soon discovered that Bo and Luke were running a lucrative moonshine business, and slapped a probation order on them which meant they could never leave Hazzard County. Cousin Daisy, meanwhile, got first-hand information of Boss Hogg's evil plans from working at his bar The Bear Pit, so the Dukes had no choice but to fight for the cause of justice and engage in at least two high-speed car chases per episode while they were at it. The result was always the same: blond Bo, a stock-car racing driver, being forced to jump over a river in the General Lee, and Sheriff Rosco and his deputy Enos (pronounced \"Enis\") having to say goodbye to yet another patrol car and give each other doleful looks as it sank into the bog.</p> <p>From this simple premise came a whole host of wildly original touches. Bo and Luke reasoned that, in the name of fighting for justice, they needed to weld the doors of the General Lee to its chassis so that they could never be opened, much to the annoyance of Uncle Jesse, whose belly got wedged in the window every time he tried to climb in. It was painted its distinctive orange because that was the only colour the moonshine-sozzled mechanic Cooter could find. In an effort to rival the \"Seaman Stains\" notoriety of Captain Pugwash, the screenwriters briefly replaced Enos with Cleetus (pronounced \"Clittus\"), but moral outrage decreed this was going too far.</p> <p>Then there was big bad Boss Hogg, diverting funds from an old people's home to build a strip joint; putting his mama's ashes in a stock-car racing trophy which he stole; attempting to uproot a cemetery to build a shopping mall on it. To highlight his badness, Bo and Luke were unnaturally nice: always remembering to say \"yes, sir\" and \"yes, mam\", never cussing and certainly never killing anybody - the worst they did was shoot an arrow at Sheriff Rosco's butt. Likewise, Daisy Duke may have dressed in a way that made Rosco call her \"a half-nekkid female woman\", but she was no tramp, and she could hold her own, whether behind the bar at The Bear Pit or behind the wheel of Dixie, her trusty jeep. She also had a Superwoman-like ability to run in high heels.</p> <p>The good times couldn't last forever, of course. Problems began in 1982, when John Schneider and Tom Wopat, the actors who played Bo and Luke, decided to strike over wages. CBS brought in Coy and Vance Duke, a couple of wussie chancers who were meant to be their cousins, but nobody was convinced. The producers duly agreed to the original Dukes' demands and brought them back, but the momentum was gone, and by 1985 the show was over.</p> <p>In America, however, once they love you, they love you forever, and public demand brought the team back together in 1997 for Hazzard Reunion.Uncle Jesse and Boss Hogg are no longer with us, but Bo, Luke and Daisy Duke are still fighting for the little guys and protecting the old ways from being abused. In Reunion, they take on a corrupt developer who is planning to build a theme park on Uncle Jesse's old farm (they have to run in a cross-country moonshine race to stop her, obviously); in Hazzard In Hollywood, Bo and Luke have to save Daisy from an evil mogul who has kidnapped her after promising to make her a star.</p> <p>These days, the Dukes are a little chunky but they can still squeeze into the window of that Dodge Charger and outrun Sheriff Rosco any day. More important, their appeal is still intact, even if their figures aren't: The Dukes Of Hazzard is a homage to a more innocent time. All you needed to know about those boys was in the first bar of that famous honky-tonk theme of theirs. \"They're just good old boys, never meanin' no harm/ Beats all you never saw, been in trouble with the law/Since the day they was born.\" Amen to that. </p> <p>\u0095 Dukes Of Hazzard, midnight,TNT, Mon-Fri</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong>UP FOR YE CUPPE!</strong></p> <p>The final of the world's oldest and grandest football competition will be played out tomorrow. Aston Villa and Chelsea's of Chelsea are the two lucky teams competing in the final of the FA's year-long nostalgia event Ye Cuppe, and both teams are desperate to succeed so they can qualify for Eur... so they can bask in the glory of lifting the famous trophy.</p> <p>\"There is a lot at stake on Saturday because entry to [Euro-Vase] is very important,\" explained John Gregory, who clearly understands the romance of the big day. \"In terms of encouraging people to want to come here in the first place, it will be beneficial if you can offer them European football. I'm sure the Inter Galactic Cup is not going to be too exciting for prospective players,\" football's Mr Comedy continued, cracking gags of such quality that the Fiver drifted into a daydream about Joe Pasquale.</p> <p>Gregory, who has a full squad to pick from with Ian Taylor and David James returning from injury, has hit upon an intelligent plan to inspire his most likely match-winner before this crucial game. He's offered temperamental genius Benito Carbone a take-it-or-leave-it contract which comes to \u00a313,000-a-week less than the player wants. That should do the trick, eh?</p> <p>Once Gianluca Vialli has stopped guffawing at Gregory's wonderful plan, he'll get around to picking a team of his own. It shouldn't be too stressful an exercise - the only doubt surrounds Albert Ferrer, who has an ankle injury, and in any case there's a ready-made replacement waiting in the shape of ex-Ajax defender Mario Melchiot. The only remaining question that could possibly keep the Blues boss up all night is: do I start with Chris Sutton?</p> <p>Sweet dreams Luca!</p> <p>Chelsea (probable): De Goey, Babayaro, Melchiot (or Ferrer), Desailly, Leboeuf, Wise, Deschamps, Poyet, Di Matteo, Zola, Flo.</p> <p>Subs from: Harley, Morris, Petrescu, Weah, Sutton, Cudicini, Terry, Hitchcock, Lambourde, Ambrosetti.</p> <p>Villa (probable): James, Ehiogu, Southgate, Barry, Delaney, Taylor, Merson, Boateng, Wright, Dublin, Carbone.</p> <p>Subs from: Enckelman, Watson, Thompson, Joachim, Hendrie, Stone, Walker, Ghrayib, Samuel.</p> <p><strong>MORNING GLORY</strong></p> <p>Sign up now for the Euro, the Fiver's extra low-down from the lowlands brought to you in association with breathe.

The England skipper did have a trip to Creosote World marked down in his diary, but sadly it's closed for refurbishment - one coat is never really enough, is it? Ever resourceful, Shearer has instead chosen to fill up his idle hours by giving interviews to the press, interviews that provide a revealing insight into the mind of the Geordie enigma.</p> <p>With all eyes on some round robin in Holland or other, Shearer made his first shocking revelation by confessing he doesn't like penalty shoot-outs all that much. \"There are not many times when I get nervous, but I do a little bit with penalties,\" said Shearer, whom many Newcastle fans are actually convinced is made of iron ore. \"There's pressure standing there with thousands of people watching you in the stadium and at home on television,\" he went on. \"You have to pick your side and not change it and try to get a bit of pace behind it.\"</p> <p>The thought of a 'Shearer in self-doubt shocker' headline caused the majority of the press pack to collapse at this point. But those who remained afoot saw Alan air his views on the 'hooligan problem'. \"It was very unfortunate the other night, they're certainly not nice things,\" he said. \"It isn't nice for our game and it isn't nice for England as a whole.\" So, after years of uncertainty, we now know that Alan Shearer places his penalties and likes people to be nice. Remember, you read it here first.</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"If I was up against Gianfranco Zola I would certainly give him a quick welcome to the Premiership\" - Chelsea legend Ron 'Chopper' Harris gives those fancy dan foreigners a piece of his mind. Gianfranco Zola has been playing in the Premiership since 1996.</p> <p><strong>GAAL STONE</strong></p> <p>The Fiver regrets not being able to make it round the De Boers' house on Wednesday night. The cheery Dutch twins were celebrating their 30th birthday you see, and all their bestest pals were there. Unloved Finnish international Jari Litmanen, technically unimpressive defender Winston Bogarde and Louis van Gaal, Catalonia's most wanted, were all there - presumably bearing gifts of buckskin luggage (with airport tags already attached). Cor, the fun they must have had.</p> <p>Yes, these are tough times in Barcelona's Dutch quarter. If Deportivo snatch a point against Espanyol this evening then they win the title and Van Gaal gets the boot. In fact it looks like ol' Cheesehead will be shown the door whatever happens. Barca's vice-president Juan Gaspar hinted cryptically at the future last night when he said: \"I'm sure Van Gaal won't even be the coach after Friday.\" A press conference will take place tomorrow afternoon, and it's unlikely to be for the signing of Pierre van Hooijdonk.</p> <p>With 744 sports pages to fill daily, the Spanish press is already speculating on the identity of not one, but two successors. Most tend to agree that short-term duties (ie: arranging flower displays in the trophy cabinet) will be performed by the youth team coach Lloren\u00e7 Serra Ferrer. In the long term, Arsene's Arsenal Wenger has been mentioned, as has Johan Cruyff, but the favourite is Ronald Koeman. The legendary Barca sweeper was formerly assistant to Van Gaal, is mates with outgoing club president Josep Llu\u00eds N\u00fa\u00f1ez and, oh yes, holds a Dutch passport. Will these people never learn?</p> <p><strong>THE RUMOUR MILL</strong></p> <p>Leeds United chairman Peter Ridsdale is believed to have authorised the purchase of either Sol Campbell or Rio Ferdinand for \u00a313m. Whether their bid is successful remains to be seen, however. As Harry Redknapp said this morning, \"The day we sell him [Rio] and our other young players is the day this club starts to die.\"</p> <p>Paris St Germain have joined the list of clubs chasing Newcastle's Didier Domi.

      "bodyText": "UP FOR YE CUPPE! The final of the world's oldest and grandest football competition will be played out tomorrow. Aston Villa and Chelsea's of Chelsea are the two lucky teams competing in the final of the FA's year-long nostalgia event Ye Cuppe, and both teams are desperate to succeed so they can qualify for Eur... so they can bask in the glory of lifting the famous trophy. \"There is a lot at stake on Saturday because entry to [Euro-Vase] is very important,\" explained John Gregory, who clearly understands the romance of the big day. \"In terms of encouraging people to want to come here in the first place, it will be beneficial if you can offer them European football. I'm sure the Inter Galactic Cup is not going to be too exciting for prospective players,\" football's Mr Comedy continued, cracking gags of such quality that the Fiver drifted into a daydream about Joe Pasquale. Gregory, who has a full squad to pick from with Ian Taylor and David James returning from injury, has hit upon an intelligent plan to inspire his most likely match-winner before this crucial game. He's offered temperamental genius Benito Carbone a take-it-or-leave-it contract which comes to \u00a313,000-a-week less than the player wants. That should do the trick, eh? Once Gianluca Vialli has stopped guffawing at Gregory's wonderful plan, he'll get around to picking a team of his own. It shouldn't be too stressful an exercise - the only doubt surrounds Albert Ferrer, who has an ankle injury, and in any case there's a ready-made replacement waiting in the shape of ex-Ajax defender Mario Melchiot. The only remaining question that could possibly keep the Blues boss up all night is: do I start with Chris Sutton? Sweet dreams Luca! Chelsea (probable): De Goey, Babayaro, Melchiot (or Ferrer), Desailly, Leboeuf, Wise, Deschamps, Poyet, Di Matteo, Zola, Flo. Subs from: Harley, Morris, Petrescu, Weah, Sutton, Cudicini, Terry, Hitchcock, Lambourde, Ambrosetti. Villa (probable): James, Ehiogu, Southgate, Barry, Delaney, Taylor, Merson, Boateng, Wright, Dublin, Carbone. Subs from: Enckelman, Watson, Thompson, Joachim, Hendrie, Stone, Walker, Ghrayib, Samuel.

The England skipper did have a trip to Creosote World marked down in his diary, but sadly it's closed for refurbishment - one coat is never really enough, is it? Ever resourceful, Shearer has instead chosen to fill up his idle hours by giving interviews to the press, interviews that provide a revealing insight into the mind of the Geordie enigma. With all eyes on some round robin in Holland or other, Shearer made his first shocking revelation by confessing he doesn't like penalty shoot-outs all that much. \"There are not many times when I get nervous, but I do a little bit with penalties,\" said Shearer, whom many Newcastle fans are actually convinced is made of iron ore. \"There's pressure standing there with thousands of people watching you in the stadium and at home on television,\" he went on. \"You have to pick your side and not change it and try to get a bit of pace behind it.\" The thought of a 'Shearer in self-doubt shocker' headline caused the majority of the press pack to collapse at this point. But those who remained afoot saw Alan air his views on the 'hooligan problem'. \"It was very unfortunate the other night, they're certainly not nice things,\" he said. \"It isn't nice for our game and it isn't nice for England as a whole.\" So, after years of uncertainty, we now know that Alan Shearer places his penalties and likes people to be nice. Remember, you read it here first. QUOTE OF THE DAY \"If I was up against Gianfranco Zola I would certainly give him a quick welcome to the Premiership\" - Chelsea legend Ron 'Chopper' Harris gives those fancy dan foreigners a piece of his mind. Gianfranco Zola has been playing in the Premiership since 1996. GAAL STONE The Fiver regrets not being able to make it round the De Boers' house on Wednesday night. The cheery Dutch twins were celebrating their 30th birthday you see, and all their bestest pals were there. Unloved Finnish international Jari Litmanen, technically unimpressive defender Winston Bogarde and Louis van Gaal, Catalonia's most wanted, were all there - presumably bearing gifts of buckskin luggage (with airport tags already attached). Cor, the fun they must have had. Yes, these are tough times in Barcelona's Dutch quarter. If Deportivo snatch a point against Espanyol this evening then they win the title and Van Gaal gets the boot. In fact it looks like ol' Cheesehead will be shown the door whatever happens. Barca's vice-president Juan Gaspar hinted cryptically at the future last night when he said: \"I'm sure Van Gaal won't even be the coach after Friday.\" A press conference will take place tomorrow afternoon, and it's unlikely to be for the signing of Pierre van Hooijdonk. With 744 sports pages to fill daily, the Spanish press is already speculating on the identity of not one, but two successors. Most tend to agree that short-term duties (ie: arranging flower displays in the trophy cabinet) will be performed by the youth team coach Lloren\u00e7 Serra Ferrer. In the long term, Arsene's Arsenal Wenger has been mentioned, as has Johan Cruyff, but the favourite is Ronald Koeman. The legendary Barca sweeper was formerly assistant to Van Gaal, is mates with outgoing club president Josep Llu\u00eds N\u00fa\u00f1ez and, oh yes, holds a Dutch passport. Will these people never learn? THE RUMOUR MILL Leeds United chairman Peter Ridsdale is believed to have authorised the purchase of either Sol Campbell or Rio Ferdinand for \u00a313m. Whether their bid is successful remains to be seen, however. As Harry Redknapp said this morning, \"The day we sell him [Rio] and our other young players is the day this club starts to die.\" Paris St Germain have joined the list of clubs chasing Newcastle's Didier Domi. They are also interested in re-signing centre-back Alain Goma, who joined the Toon for \u00a34.25m last summer but spent most of the past season injured. Gianfranco Zola has been offered the chance to join Napoli this summer, after they achieved promotion to Serie A. NEWS IN BRIEF Arsenal are hoping to complete a \u00a37m deal for Marseille winger Robert Pires in the next seven days. The Frenchman is expected in London next week for talks and he said today: \"For the moment I haven't met anyone with a view to a transfer, but I think that the issue will be sorted out in a few days.\" Henrik Larsson has asked to play in Celtic's last home game of the season against Dundee United to prove his fitness for Euro 2000. Sweden have named a preliminary 20-man squad for Euro 2000 with two places being left free, one to possibly accommodate Larsson. Everton striker Kevin Campbell is almost certain to miss the beginning of next season after picking up an infection in his knee after surgery. Watford have placed Northern Ireland defender Mark Williams on the transfer list. Kilmarnock have announced a new \u00a3500,000 three-year sponsorship deal with leisurewear company TFG Sports.

      "body": "<p>The Coen Brothers may not have the strangest film in Cannes this year, but they can certainly boast the drollest promotional giveaway. It's a three-ounce tub of waxy, orange-coloured, sweetly-scented stuff labelled \"Dan Men's Pomade\". It carries the portrait of a rakishly coiffed George Clooney, looking determined and modelling a convincing facsimile of Clark Gable's moustache. </p> <p>As promo novelties go, it makes a change from T-shirts and tote bags, and it relates more precisely to the advertised film than is usually the case. In the Coens' new film, O Brother, Where Art Thou?, Clooney's character Ulysses Everett McGill, an escapee from a southern chain gang, wouldn't go anywhere without a dab of Dapper Dan to sweeten his locks. His flight across the deep south is, you can imagine, rather more facetious than the 30s chain gang movies that the Coens take as their model. </p> <p>Minnesota-born brothers Joel and Ethan are known for liking their bit of fun, and in their latest film, they haven't stinted themselves. O Brother is several films in one: a tale of three desperadoes on the lam in rural Mississippi; a blues and country musical; and, allegedly at least, a rewrite of Homer's Odyssey. Not that they've actually read the Odyssey, they admit. Fortunately, Ethan Coen says, one of the film's leads, Tim Blake Nelson, is a classicist. \"I wonder if he read it in Greek? I know he read it.\" \"Yeah,\" confirms Joel. \"Did he?\" Ethan insists. \"I don't know if he read it in Greek,\" says Joel. \"I know he read it.\" </p> <p>\"Between the cast and us,\" says Ethan, \"Tim Nelson is the only one who's actually read the Odyssey.\" There's little point, then, kicking yourself if you can't place all the allusions. The Sirens are easy enough, a trio of singing Amazons doing their laundry in the Mississippi. And the Cyclops is John Goodman in an eyepatch.</p> <p>Scylla and Charybdis I was less certain about. \"Scylla and Charybdis? Where were they?\" puzzles Ethan. The whirlpool at the end, surely? \"Oh,\" the brothers chorus, \"the whirlpool.\" Ethan grins pensively. \"Oh, yeah, sure, Scylla and Charybdis.\" Joel says, \"It's very, you, usually know selectively based on the Odyssey.\" Interviewers often lament that with the Coens, there's no point even asking: they don't give anything away. </p> <p>They have this reputation as tight-lipped enigmatic sorts who make enigmatic films. And yet the films pretty much speak for themselves; they are flawlessly accessible, even if you don't catch all the references to old movies and pulp paperbacks. The only thing that properly seems bizarre about the brothers' work is the breadth of their imagination: they specialise in pinpointing the kind of images and cultural references that are usually outside the remit of contemporary American cinema.</p> <p>There's nothing that bizarre, if you think of it, about choosing to set a crime thriller in snowbound Minnesota, as the brothers did in Fargo, and having villains who relax by going to see Jose Feliciano in concert; it's just that it took the Coens to think of it. Every Coen film describes a world so thoroughly conceived that each one is its own fictional micro-climate; in a sense the brothers don't really need to add much commentary. Hence, perhaps, the sense that when they give interviews, they are aware of the futility of the venture. </p> <p>Here they are in Cannes again, sitting in the casino on top of the Carlton hotel, and although they have visited several times in the past (their Barton Fink won the Palme d'Or in 1991), they don't quite seem to belong. Older brother Joel looks as though he's done all the interviews he wants to in a lifetime, Ethan as though he's never done one in his life. Joel seems to have dressed for the part of the hot auteur in town and then let it all get messed up over a rough morning: shoulder-length hair more scrupulously crimped than previously, in a black jacket that could be either very cheap or very expensive; both the beard and the low mutter are reminiscent of Frank Zappa, and he keeps looking absently around the room as if he's wondering how long it is till lunch. </p> <p>The friendlier Ethan, in a murky brown plaid shirt, with a scraggy beard and a faceful of freckles, constantly grins broadly, occasionally giving a wheezy laugh, and seems to be relishing various private jokes as if they've only just crossed his mind. Despite the grandiose title, O Brother, Where Art Thou? is as downhome and earthy a film as has come out of recent American cinema, although it lacks the lightness of touch of the Coens' best comedies. </p> <p>It shares its title with the apocryphal movie planned by Joel McCrea's idealistic Hollywood director in Preston Sturges' 1941 comedy Sullivan's Travels (currently on re-release). Sullivan heads out across America to research his serious Steinbeckian hobo drama, only to conclude that it's a far nobler calling to make 'em laugh.</p> <p>But the Coens' O Brother is not entirely the film that Sullivan would have made. \"It pretends to be a big important movie,\" says Ethan, \"but the grandiosity is obviously a joke. It is what it is, it's a comedy. There is a chain-gang interlude in Sullivan's Travels, but that's it.\" O Brother is another example of the Coens' partiality to period: Miller's Crossing, Barton Fink and The Hudsucker Proxy all explored past decades, and even their last film, The Big Lebowski, had a certain distance, being set in the early 90s as opposed to 1998.</p> <p>\"We tend to do period stuff,\" says Ethan, \"because it helps make it one step removed from boring everyday reality.\" Their latest film carries a considerable weight of historical authenticity, not least in the soundtrack of vintage southern music - gospel, Delta blues and early country swing - assembled by singer-songwriter and one-time Dylan collaborator T-Bone Burnett. </p> <p>One of the film's themes is the congruence of pre-war American pop with history and politics, as the errant jailbird trio encounter various real-life characters, among them gangster George \"Baby Face\" Nelson and blues singer Tommy Johnson, who, like the better known Robert Johnson, was reputed to have sold his soul to the devil in exchange for blues prowess. Another real character is Texas governor Pappy O'Daniel, who would go electioneering accompanied by a \"stump band\", a music show to whip up popular support. \"They'd draw the crowds,\" explains Joel. \"People came to listen to the music and then they'd have to listen to the speech.\" </p> <p>The film's southern history, musical and political, looks detailed enough to have been thoroughly researched, but the Coens insist it wasn't. \"It's all stuff that to one extent or another we were aware of,\" Joel says. \"It was all back there somewhere and filtered up into the script. We weren't going out and doing research and trying to apply it to a story, it's all much more haphazard. It wasn't like we were trying to create a realistic picture of the time and place so much as an imagined world where all those things intersect - real people and made-up people.\"</p> <p>Both are keen that the film shouldn't be taken too seriously, even though for the first time (give or take the socialist convictions of their playwright Barton Fink, and the trendy crypto-fascists in The Big Lebowski) they seem to be focusing on political realities in O Brother. \"The political undercurrent of the movie,\" says Joel, \"functions primarily for dramatic purposes, because the politics are frankly pretty primitive. The bad guys are racial bigots and KKK Grand Dragons, and the good guys are the heroes of the movie. So it's all kind of a story thing.\" </p> <p>Even so, the film pulls off something of a coup in managing to be more politically flippant than American comedies have managed since Mel Brooks's heyday. The scene where the heroes blithely wander into a torchlit KKK rally might, I suggest to the brothers, strike some viewers as being of questionable taste.</p> <p>\"Taste,\" says Joel, \"has never been something we've worried about.\" \"We're not big on taste,\" agrees Ethan, his grin broadening even further. \"And actually, if you don't pander to undue sensitivities then it ends up usually not being much of a problem. In The Big Lebowski, we dumped the crippled guy out of the wheelchair, and no one seemed to mind that.\" \"Everyone was saying, 'You're going to get a huge amount of mail from disabled people about this'. But it's all in the context of the story, and done by the John Goodman character who's clearly an idiot,\" says Joel, and Ethan cracks up in laughter.</p> <p>They are among the most film-literate of mainstream US directors - not indiscriminate movie-guzzlers of the Tarantino school, but scholars of a longer history whose films have referenced Warner Bros gangster pics, Busby Berkeley musicals, and even William Faulkner's fraught Hollywood tenure as a hired script hand. </p> <p>But the only time they directly used other films as a starting point, the brothers say, was in their 1994 film (probably their least-liked, unjustly so) The Hudsucker Proxy. \"We knew we were doing a sort of Capra-esque thing,\" says Ethan, \"but even that was not a specific one of his movies, just the whole sort of' just his thing, right?\" They no longer consume films so tirelessly, they admit, largely the result of having children (Ethan has two; Joel has one, with his wife and occasional lead actress Frances McDormand). \"We don't watch them together a lot,\" says Ethan, \"and neither of us watches as many as we used to. It's actually gotten more and more hit-and-miss - movies that I planned to see and never end up seeing.\" </p> <p>It is generally assumed that the Coens equally represent the presiding genius of their films, but while they share writing credits, Ethan is billed as producer and Joel as director. This means that in Cannes, each film is officially billed as \"un film de Joel Coen\", although their own production notes specify, \"A Film by Joel Coen and Ethan Coen.\" Confusingly, only Joel's photo appears in the O Brother press kit. </p> <p>Of the two, it's Ethan who has explored outside ventures. He recently wrote The Naked Man, a film by the duo's regular storyboard artist J Todd Anderson, about a character actor who moonlights as a pro wrestler. The film got a critical thumbs-down. \"I thought it was very funny,\" Ethan says. \"I enjoyed it, and not just in a pride of ownership, 'cause it's really J Todd's thing. It didn't get a theatrical release, for reasons I can understand. Its nobody's idea of a big audience mainstream movie.\" </p> <p>More prominent was Gates of Eden, the short story collection that Ethan published in 1998. It is frustrating, in a way, because it suggests there's much more to his imagination and linguistic prowess than he is necessarily prepared to put into his movies. More striking than the dry squibs and Chandler parodies are the complex, concise character sketches, and the adolescent anecdotes which hint at the personally revealing movie the Coens have yet to make - although in all honesty, it's hard to imagine them coming up with a screen evocation of a synagogue-going Jewish upbringing in 60s Minnesota. </p> <p>The next Coen brothers film starts shooting in six weeks. Known as The Barbershop Project, it stars Frances McDormand and Billy Bob Thornton. \"It's set in a barbershop and is concerned with the minutiae of the barbering trade in the late 40s.\" Is that why their distributor has been handing out Dapper Dan's pomade - as a teaser? \"It's just a coincidence,\" says Joel. \"There's a lot of hair products in this next film.\" \"Actually,\" says Ethan, \"we use pomade in Raising Arizona as well, as a means of tracking the characters. It's a tired old gag.\" I scan Joel's faintly slicked locks for traces of his own hair-care product. Would he personally recommend Dapper Dan? \"I take no responsibility for that pomade,\" he says.</p> <p>\u0095 O Brother, Where Art Thou, will be released later this year.</p>",

It wasn't like we were trying to create a realistic picture of the time and place so much as an imagined world where all those things intersect - real people and made-up people.\" Both are keen that the film shouldn't be taken too seriously, even though for the first time (give or take the socialist convictions of their playwright Barton Fink, and the trendy crypto-fascists in The Big Lebowski) they seem to be focusing on political realities in O Brother. \"The political undercurrent of the movie,\" says Joel, \"functions primarily for dramatic purposes, because the politics are frankly pretty primitive. The bad guys are racial bigots and KKK Grand Dragons, and the good guys are the heroes of the movie. So it's all kind of a story thing.\" Even so, the film pulls off something of a coup in managing to be more politically flippant than American comedies have managed since Mel Brooks's heyday. The scene where the heroes blithely wander into a torchlit KKK rally might, I suggest to the brothers, strike some viewers as being of questionable taste. \"Taste,\" says Joel, \"has never been something we've worried about.\" \"We're not big on taste,\" agrees Ethan, his grin broadening even further. \"And actually, if you don't pander to undue sensitivities then it ends up usually not being much of a problem. In The Big Lebowski, we dumped the crippled guy out of the wheelchair, and no one seemed to mind that.\" \"Everyone was saying, 'You're going to get a huge amount of mail from disabled people about this'. But it's all in the context of the story, and done by the John Goodman character who's clearly an idiot,\" says Joel, and Ethan cracks up in laughter. They are among the most film-literate of mainstream US directors - not indiscriminate movie-guzzlers of the Tarantino school, but scholars of a longer history whose films have referenced Warner Bros gangster pics, Busby Berkeley musicals, and even William Faulkner's fraught Hollywood tenure as a hired script hand. But the only time they directly used other films as a starting point, the brothers say, was in their 1994 film (probably their least-liked, unjustly so) The Hudsucker Proxy. \"We knew we were doing a sort of Capra-esque thing,\" says Ethan, \"but even that was not a specific one of his movies, just the whole sort of' just his thing, right?\" They no longer consume films so tirelessly, they admit, largely the result of having children (Ethan has two; Joel has one, with his wife and occasional lead actress Frances McDormand). \"We don't watch them together a lot,\" says Ethan, \"and neither of us watches as many as we used to. It's actually gotten more and more hit-and-miss - movies that I planned to see and never end up seeing.\" It is generally assumed that the Coens equally represent the presiding genius of their films, but while they share writing credits, Ethan is billed as producer and Joel as director. This means that in Cannes, each film is officially billed as \"un film de Joel Coen\", although their own production notes specify, \"A Film by Joel Coen and Ethan Coen.\" Confusingly, only Joel's photo appears in the O Brother press kit. Of the two, it's Ethan who has explored outside ventures. He recently wrote The Naked Man, a film by the duo's regular storyboard artist J Todd Anderson, about a character actor who moonlights as a pro wrestler. The film got a critical thumbs-down. \"I thought it was very funny,\" Ethan says. \"I enjoyed it, and not just in a pride of ownership, 'cause it's really J Todd's thing. It didn't get a theatrical release, for reasons I can understand. Its nobody's idea of a big audience mainstream movie.\" More prominent was Gates of Eden, the short story collection that Ethan published in 1998. It is frustrating, in a way, because it suggests there's much more to his imagination and linguistic prowess than he is necessarily prepared to put into his movies. More striking than the dry squibs and Chandler parodies are the complex, concise character sketches, and the adolescent anecdotes which hint at the personally revealing movie the Coens have yet to make - although in all honesty, it's hard to imagine them coming up with a screen evocation of a synagogue-going Jewish upbringing in 60s Minnesota. The next Coen brothers film starts shooting in six weeks. Known as The Barbershop Project, it stars Frances McDormand and Billy Bob Thornton. \"It's set in a barbershop and is concerned with the minutiae of the barbering trade in the late 40s.\" Is that why their distributor has been handing out Dapper Dan's pomade - as a teaser? \"It's just a coincidence,\" says Joel. \"There's a lot of hair products in this next film.\" \"Actually,\" says Ethan, \"we use pomade in Raising Arizona as well, as a means of tracking the characters. It's a tired old gag.\" I scan Joel's faintly slicked locks for traces of his own hair-care product. Would he personally recommend Dapper Dan? \"I take no responsibility for that pomade,\" he says. \u0095 O Brother, Where Art Thou, will be released later this year.",

But apparently it's all the rage to find out which hues are \"you\" - only this time the fad has nothing to do with clothes. The latest trend - wouldn't you just know it - is to analyse your hair. </p> <p>According to the professionals, spur-of-the-moment dyeing is a no-no; before leaping from chestnut brown to screaming red, you have to go through a consultation to see what colour really suits you. Ker-ching! Welcome to L'Or\u00e9al's new Talking Colour initiative (tel 0800 072 6699 for details): before you even get to smell the sweet scent of peroxide, you are asked to consider your clothes, lifestyle and personality, in a quiz best suited to the pages of J17. Are you, for instance, classic, romantic or natural? Tick box. Social, sporty or shy? Tick box. You then move on to tone analysis, where colour cards (like paint swatches) are held in front of your face to see if you are a \"cool\" or \"warm\" person. </p> <p>Schwarzkopf's Igora Color System (01296 314 189) runs along the same lines, concentrating on your tones to determine the nine hair colour types that \"belong to you\". Next they give you a Colour Passport which tells you which clothes and make-up should complement you, too. This is where it gets annoying, as however much you like a hair colour, the stylist will usually tell you it doesn't suit you. </p> <p>Both of these consultations take roughly 15 minutes: the bonus is that you end up with a hair colour specifically tailored to your needs - perfect if you're not sure what you want or are colour-shy. For us, though, the joy of hair colouring will always be grabbing a random dye from Boots and seeing what happens. Philistines, we know. </p>",

      "bodyText": "We thought it was only bored housewives who went to \"get their colours done\" - that is, paid for a consultation to find out which Jaeger outfits best matched their autumn skintones. But apparently it's all the rage to find out which hues are \"you\" - only this time the fad has nothing to do with clothes. The latest trend - wouldn't you just know it - is to analyse your hair. According to the professionals, spur-of-the-moment dyeing is a no-no; before leaping from chestnut brown to screaming red, you have to go through a consultation to see what colour really suits you. Ker-ching! Welcome to L'Or\u00e9al's new Talking Colour initiative (tel 0800 072 6699 for details): before you even get to smell the sweet scent of peroxide, you are asked to consider your clothes, lifestyle and personality, in a quiz best suited to the pages of J17. Are you, for instance, classic, romantic or natural? Tick box. Social, sporty or shy? Tick box. You then move on to tone analysis, where colour cards (like paint swatches) are held in front of your face to see if you are a \"cool\" or \"warm\" person. Schwarzkopf's Igora Color System (01296 314 189) runs along the same lines, concentrating on your tones to determine the nine hair colour types that \"belong to you\". Next they give you a Colour Passport which tells you which clothes and make-up should complement you, too. This is where it gets annoying, as however much you like a hair colour, the stylist will usually tell you it doesn't suit you. Both of these consultations take roughly 15 minutes: the bonus is that you end up with a hair colour specifically tailored to your needs - perfect if you're not sure what you want or are colour-shy. For us, though, the joy of hair colouring will always be grabbing a random dye from Boots and seeing what happens. Philistines, we know.",

      "body": "<p>1. </p> <p>July 1950 - I may never be happy, but tonight I am content. Nothing more than an empty house, the warm hazy weariness from a day spent setting strawberry runners in the sun, a glass of cool sweet milk, and a shallow dish of blueberries bathed in cream. Now I know how people can live without books, without college. When one is so tired at the end of a day one must sleep, and at the next dawn there are more strawberry runners to set, and so one goes on living, near the earth. At times like this I'd call myself a fool to ask for more ... </p> <p>2. </p> <p>Ilo asked me today in the strawberry field, \"Do you like the Renaissance painters? Raphael and Michelangelo? I copied some of Michelangelo once. And what do you think of Picasso ... These painters who make a circle and a little board going down for a leg?\" We worked side by side in the rows, and he would be quiet for a while, then suddenly burst out with conversation, speaking with his thick German accent. He straightened up, his tan, intelligent face crinkling up with laughter. His chunky, muscular body was bronzed, and his blonde hair tucked up under a white handkerchief around his head. He said, \"You like Frank Sinatra? So sendimental, so romandic, so moonlight night, Ja?\" </p> <p>3. </p> <p>A sudden slant of bluish light across the floor of a vacant room. And I knew it was not the streetlight, but the moon. What is more wonderful than to be a virgin, clean and sound and young, on such a night? ... (being raped.) </p> <p>4. </p> <p>Tonight was awful. It was the combination of everything. Of the play \"Goodbye My Fancy,\" of wanting, in a juvenile way, to be, like the heroine, a reporter in the trenches, to be loved by a man who admired me, who understood me as much as I understood myself. And then there was Jack, who tried so hard to be nice, who was hurt when I said all he wanted was to make out. There was the dinner at the country club, the affluence of money everywhere. And then there was the record ... the one so good for dancing. I forgot that it was the one until Louie Armstrong began to sing in a voice husky with regret, \"I've flown around the world in a plane, settled revolutions in Spain, the North pole I have charted ... still I can't get started with you.\" Jack said: \"Ever heard it before?\" So I smiled, \"Oh, yes.\" It was Bob. That settled things for me - a crazy record, and it was our long talks, his listening and understanding. And I knew I loved him. </p> <p>5. </p> <p>Tonight I saw Mary. Jack and I were pushing out of the theater in a current of people, and she was edging the other way in a dark blue jacket. I hardly recognized her with her eyes downcast, her face made up. But beautiful. \"I've been looking all over for you,\" I said. \"Mary. Call me, write me.\" She smiled, a little like the Mary I used to know, and she was gone. I knew I would never have a friend quite like her. So I went out in a white dress, a white coat, with a rich boy. And I hated myself for my hypocrasy. I love Mary. Betsy is nothing but fun; hysterical fun. Mary is me ... what I would be if I had been born of Italian parents on Linden Street. She is something vital, an artist's model, life. She can be rude, undependable, and she is more to me than all the pretty, well-to-do, artificial girls I could ever meet. Maybe it's my ego. Maybe I crave someone who will never be my rival. But with her I can be honest. She could be a prostitute, and I would not give a damn; I'll never deny her as a friend ... </p> <p>6. </p> <p>Today is the first of August. It is hot, steamy and wet. It is raining. I am tempted to write a poem. But I remember what it said on one rejection slip: After a heavy rainfall, poems titled RAIN pour in from across the nation. </p> <p>7. </p> <p>I love people. Everybody. I love them, I think, as a stamp collector loves his collection. Every story, every incident, every bit of conversation is raw material for me. My love's not impersonal yet not wholly subjective either. I would like to be everyone, a cripple, a dying man, a whore, and then come back to write about my thoughts, my emotions, as that person. But I am not omniscient. I have to live my life, and it is the only one I'll ever have. And you cannot regard your own life with objective curiosity all the time ... </p> <p>8. </p> <p>With me, the present is forever, and forever is always shifting, flowing, melting. This second is life. And when it is gone it is dead. But you can't start over with each new second. You have to judge by what is dead. It's like quicksand ... hopeless from the start. A story, a picture, can renew sensation a little, but not enough, not enough. Nothing is real except the present, and already, I feel the weight of centuries smothering me. Some girl a hundred years ago once lived as I do. And she is dead. I am the present, but I know I, too, will pass. The high moment, the burning flash, come and are gone, continuous quicksand. And I don't want to die. </p> <p>9. </p> <p>Some things are hard to write about. After something happens to you, you go to write it down, and either you over dramatize it or underplay it, exaggerate the wrong parts or ignore the important ones. At any rate, you never write it quite the way you want to. I've just got to put down what happened to me this afternoon. I can't tell mother; not yet, anyway. She was in my room when I came home, fussing with clothes, and she didn't even sense that something had happened. She just kept scolding and chattering on and on. So I couldn't stop her and tell her. No matter how it comes out, I have to write it. </p> <p> It rained all afternoon at the farm, and I was cold and wet, my hair under a silk print kerchief, my red ski jacket over my sweatshirt. I had worked hard on beans all afternoon and picked over three bushels. Since it was five o'clock, people were leaving, and I was waiting beside the cars for my ride home. Kathy had just come up, and as she got on her bike she called, \"Here comes Ilo.\" </p> <p> I looked, and sure enough, there he was, coming up the road in his old khaki shirt with his familiar white handkerchief tied around his head. I was on conversational terms with him since that day we worked together in the strawberry field. He had given me a pen and ink sketch of the farm, drawn with detail and assurance. Now he was working on a sketch of one of the boys. </p> <p> So I called, \"Have you finished John's picture?\" </p> <p> \"Oh, ya, ya,\" he smiled. \"Come and see. Your last chance.\" He had promised to show it to me when he was done, so I ran out and got in step with him on his way to the barn. That's where he lives. </p> <p> On the way, we passed Mary Coffee. I felt her looking at me rather strangely. Somehow I couldn't meet her eyes. </p> <p> \"Hullo, Mary,\" Ilo said. </p> <p> \"Hello, Ilo,\" Mary said in an oddly colorless voice. </p> <p> We walked by Ginny, Sally, and a crowd of kids keeping dry in the tractor shed. A roar went up as we passed. A singsong, \"Oh, Sylvia.\" My cheeks burned. </p> <p> \"Why do they have to tease me?\" I asked. Ilo just laughed. He was walking very fast. </p> <p> \"We're going home in a little while,\" Milton yelled from the washroom. </p> <p> I nodded and kept walking, looking at the ground. Then we were at the barn, a huge place, a giant high ceilinged room smelling of horses and damp hay. It was dim inside; I thought I saw the figure of a person on the other side of the stalls, but I couldn't be sure. Without saying a word, Ilo had begun to mount a narrow flight of wooden stairs. </p> <p> \"You live up there? All these stairs?\" </p> <p> He kept walking up, so I followed him, hesitating at the top. </p> <p> \"Come in, come in,\" he said, opening a door. The picture was there, in his room. I walked over the threshold. It was a narrow place with two windows, a table full of drawing things, and a cot, covered with a dark blanket. Oranges and milk were set out on a table with a radio. </p> <p> \"Here,\" he held out the picture. It was a fine pencil sketch of John's head. </p> <p> \"Why, how do you do it? With the side of the pencil?\" </p> <p> It seemed of no significance then, but now I remember how Ilo had shut the door, had turned on the radio so that music came out. </p> <p> He talked very fast, showing me a pencil. \"See, here the lead comes out, any size.\" I was very conscious of his nearness. His blue eyes were startlingly close, looking at me boldly, with flecks of laughter in them. </p> <p> \"I really have to go. They will be waiting. The picture was lovely.\" </p> <p> Smiling, he was between me and the door. A motion. His hand closed around my arm. And suddenly his mouth was on mine, hard, vehement, his tongue darting between my lips, his arms like iron around me. </p> <p> \"Ilo, Ilo!\" I don't know whether I screamed or whispered, struggling to break free, my hands striking wildly, futiley against his great strength. At last he let me go, and stood back. I held my hand against my mouth, warm and bruised from his kiss. He looked at me quizzically, with something like surprised amusement as he saw that I was crying, frightened. No one ever kissed me that way before, and I stood there, flooded with longing, electric, shivering. </p> <p> \"Why, why,\" he made sympathetic, depreciating little noises. \"I get you some water.\" </p> <p> He poured me out a glass, and I drank it. He opened the door, and I stumbled blindly downstairs, past Maybelle and Robert, the little colored children, who called my name in the corrupted way kids have of pronouncing things. Past Mary Lou, their mother, who stood there, a silent, dark presence. </p> <p> And I was outdoors. A truck was going by. Coming from behind the barn. In it was Bernie - the horrible, short, muscular boy from the washroom. His eyes glittered with malicious delight, and he drove fast, so I could not catch up with him. Had he been in the barn? Had he seen Ilo shut the door, seen me come out? I think he must have. </p> <p> I walked up past the washroom to the cars. Bernie yelled out, \"Why are you crying?\" I wasn't crying. Kenny and Freddy came by on the tractor. A group of boys, going home, looked at me with a light flickering somewhere in their eyes. \"Did he kiss you?\" one asked, with a knowing smile. </p> <p> I felt sick. I couldn't have spoken if someone had talked to me. My voice was stuck in my throat, thick and furry. </p> <p> Mr. Tompkins came up to the pump to watch Kenny and Freddy run the old stock car. They were nice, but they knew. They all must know. </p> <p> \"There's cutie pie,\" Kenny said. </p> <p> \"Cutie pie and angel face.\" Freddy said. </p> <p> So I stood there, arms folded, staring at the whirring engine, smiling as if I was all right, as if nothing had happened. </p> <p> Milton sat in the rumble seat with me going home. David drove, and Andy was in front. They all looked at me with that dancing light in their eyes. David said in a stiff, strained voice, \"Everybody in the washroom was watching you go into the barn and making wisecracks.\" </p> <p> Milton asked about the picture. We talked a little about art and drawing. They were all so nice. I think they may have been relieved at my narrow escape; they may have expected me to cry. They knew, though, they knew. </p> <p> So I'm home. And tomorrow I have to face the whole damn farm. Good Lord, It might have happened in a dream. Now I can almost believe it did. But tomorrow my name will be on the tip of every tongue. I wish I could be smart, or flip, but I'm too scared. If only he hadn't kissed me. I'll have to lie and say he didn't. But they know. They all know. And what am I against so many ...? </p> <p>10. </p> <p> This morning I had my two left wisdom teeth out. At 9 A.M. I walked into the dentist's office. Quickly, with a heavy sense of impending doom, I sat in the chair after a rapid, furtive glance around the room for any obvious instruments of torture such as a pneumatic drill or a gas mask. No such thing. The doctor pinned the bib around my neck; I was just about prepared for him to stick an apple in my mouth and strew sprigs of parsley on my head. But no. All he did was ask, \"Gas or novacaine?\" (Gas or novacaine. Heh, heh! Would like to see what we have on stock, madam? Death by fire or water, by the bullet or the noose. Anything to please the customer.) \"Gas,\" I said firmly. The nurse sneaked up behind me, put a rubber oval over my nose, the tubes of it cutting pleasantly into my cheek. \"Breathe easily.\" The gas sifted in, strange and sickeningly sweet. I tried not to fight it. The dentist put something in my mouth, and the gas began to come in in big gulps. I had been staring at the light. It quivered, shook, broke into little pieces. The whole constellation of little iridescent fragments started to swing in a rhythmic arc, slow at first, then faster, faster. I didn't have to try hard to breathe now; something was pumping at my lungs, giving forth an odd, breathy wheeze as I exhaled. I felt my mouth cracking up into a smile. So that's how it was ... so simple, and no one had told me. I had to write it, to describe how it was, before I went under. I fancied my right hand was the tip of the arc, curved up, but just as my hand got into position, the arc would swing the other way, gaining momentum. How clever of them, I thought. They kept the feeling all secret; they wouldn't even let you write it down. And then I was on a pirate ship, the captain's face peering at me from behind the wheel, as he swung it, steering. There were columns of black, and green leaves, and he was saying loudly, \"All right, close down easily, easily.\" Then the sunlight burst into the room through the venetian blinds; I breathed hard, filling my lungs with air. I could see my feet, my arms; there I was. I tried hard to get back in my body again ... it was such a long way to my feet. I lifted my hands, to my head; they shook. It was all over ... till next Saturday. </p> <p>11. </p> <p>Emile. There it is; his name. And what can I say? I can say he called for me at nine Saturday night, that I was still weak from having two wisdom teeth out that morning. I can say that we went on a double date dancing at Ten Acres, that I drank five glasses, in the course of the evening, to the bottom, of sparkling tawny gingerale, while the others drank beer. But that's not it. Not at all. This is how it was. I dressed slowly, smoothing, perfuming, powdering. I sat upstairs in the moist gray twilight, with the rain trickling down outside, while the family talked and laughed with company down on the porch. This is I, I thought, the American virgin, dressed to seduce. I know I'm in for an evening of sexual pleasure. We go on dates, we play around, and if we're nice girls, we demure at a certain point. And so it goes. We walked into the bar and sat down, two by two. E. and I had the initial strangeness to rub off. We began to talk - about the funeral he went to this morning, about his twenty year old cousin who broke his back and is paralyzed for life, about his sister who died of pneumonia at twelve years. \"Good lord, we're morbid tonight,\" he shuddered. And then, \"You know something I've always liked ... I mean wanted to like? Dark eyes and blonde hair.\" So we talked about little things, how words lose their meaning when you repeat them over and over; how all people of the Negro race look alike until you get to know them individually; how we always liked the age we were at best. \"I pity Warrie,\" he said, nodding at the other boy. \"He's twenty-two, out of Amherst, and he has to work the rest of his life. When I figure ... only two more years of college.\" </p> <p> \"I know, I've always dreaded birthdays.\" </p> <p> \"You don't look as young as you are.\" </p> <p> \"I don't see,\" I said, \"how people stand being old. Your insides all dry up. When you're young you're so self-reliant. You don't even need much religion.\" </p> <p> \"You're not by any chance a Catholic?\" He asked as if it were quite unlikely. </p> <p> \"No. You?\" </p> <p> \"Yes.\" He said it very low. </p> <p> There was more small talk, more laughing, sidelong glances, more of the unspoken physical friction that makes each new conquest so delightful. In the air was the strong smell of masculinity which creates the ideal medium for me to exist in. There was something in Emile tonight, a touch of seriousness, a chemical magnetism, that met my mood the way two pieces of a child's puzzle fit together. He has a fine face, dark hair, and eyes with enormous black pupils; a straight nose, a one-sided flashing grin, a clean-cut chin. He is neatly made, with small, sensitive hands. I knew it would be the way it was. On the dance floor he held me close to him, the hard line of his penis taut against my stomach, my breasts aching firm against his chest. And it was like warm wine flooding through me, a sleepy, electric drowsiness. He nuzzled his face in my hair; kissed my cheek. \"Don't look at me,\" he said. \"I've just come out of a swimming pool, hot and wet.\" (God, I knew it would be like this.) He was looking at me intently, searchingly, and our eyes met. I went under twice; I was drowning; and he flicked his gaze away. On the way to Warrie's at midnight, Emile kissed me in the car, his mouth wet and gentle on mine. At Warrie's, more gingerale, more beer, and dancing with the dim light from the porch, Emile's body warm and firm against mine, rocking back and forth to the soft, erotic music. (Dancing is the normal prelude to intercourse. All the dancing classes when we are too young to understand, and then this.) \"You know,\" Emile looked at me, \"we ought to sit down.\" I shook my head. \"No?\" he said. \"How about some water, then. Feel all right?\" (Feel all right. Oh, yes. Yes, thank you.) He steered me out to the kitchen, cool, smelling of linoleum, with the sound of the rain falling outside. I sat and sipped the water he brought me, while he stood looking down, his features strange in the half-light. I put the glass down. \"That was quick,\" he said. \"Should I have taken longer?\" I stood up and his face moved in, his arms about me. After a while I pushed him away. \"The rain's rather nice. It makes you feel good inside, elemental, just to listen.\" I was backed against the sink; Emile was close, warm, his eyes glittering, his mouth sensuous and lovely. \"You,\" I said deliberately, \"don't give a damn about me except physically.\" Any boy would deny that; any gallant boy; any gallant lier. But Emile shook me, his voice was urgent, \"You know, you shouldn't have said that. You know? You know? The truth always hurts.\" (Even clich*s can come in handy.) He grinned, \"Don't be bitter; I'm not. Come away from the sink, and watch.\" He stepped back, drawing me toward him, slapping my stomach away, he kissed me long and sweetly. At last he let go. \"There,\" he said with a quiet smile. \"The truth doesn't always hurt, does it?\" And so we left. It was pouring rain. In the car he put his arm around me, his head against mine, and we watched the streetlights coming at us, blurred and fluid in the watery dark. As we ran up the walk in the rain, as he came in and had a drink of water, as he kissed me goodnight, I knew that something in me wanted him, for what I'm not sure: He drinks, he smokes, he's Catholic, he runs around with one girl after another, and yet ... I wanted him. \"I don't have to tell you it's been nice,\" I said at the door. \"It's been marvelous,\" he smiled. \"I'll call you. Take care.\" And he was gone. So the rain comes down hard outside my room, and like Eddie Cohen, I say, \"... fifteen thousand years - of what? We're still nothing but animals.\" Somewhere, in his room, Emile lies, about to sleep, listening to the rain. God only knows what he's thinking. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/firstchapters/story/0,6761,222716,00.html\">Continue</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "1. July 1950 - I may never be happy, but tonight I am content. Nothing more than an empty house, the warm hazy weariness from a day spent setting strawberry runners in the sun, a glass of cool sweet milk, and a shallow dish of blueberries bathed in cream. Now I know how people can live without books, without college. When one is so tired at the end of a day one must sleep, and at the next dawn there are more strawberry runners to set, and so one goes on living, near the earth. At times like this I'd call myself a fool to ask for more ... 2. Ilo asked me today in the strawberry field, \"Do you like the Renaissance painters? Raphael and Michelangelo? I copied some of Michelangelo once. And what do you think of Picasso ... These painters who make a circle and a little board going down for a leg?\" We worked side by side in the rows, and he would be quiet for a while, then suddenly burst out with conversation, speaking with his thick German accent. He straightened up, his tan, intelligent face crinkling up with laughter. His chunky, muscular body was bronzed, and his blonde hair tucked up under a white handkerchief around his head. He said, \"You like Frank Sinatra? So sendimental, so romandic, so moonlight night, Ja?\" 3. A sudden slant of bluish light across the floor of a vacant room. And I knew it was not the streetlight, but the moon. What is more wonderful than to be a virgin, clean and sound and young, on such a night? ... (being raped.) 4. Tonight was awful. It was the combination of everything. Of the play \"Goodbye My Fancy,\" of wanting, in a juvenile way, to be, like the heroine, a reporter in the trenches, to be loved by a man who admired me, who understood me as much as I understood myself. And then there was Jack, who tried so hard to be nice, who was hurt when I said all he wanted was to make out. There was the dinner at the country club, the affluence of money everywhere. And then there was the record ... the one so good for dancing. I forgot that it was the one until Louie Armstrong began to sing in a voice husky with regret, \"I've flown around the world in a plane, settled revolutions in Spain, the North pole I have charted ... still I can't get started with you.\" Jack said: \"Ever heard it before?\" So I smiled, \"Oh, yes.\" It was Bob. That settled things for me - a crazy record, and it was our long talks, his listening and understanding. And I knew I loved him. 5. Tonight I saw Mary. Jack and I were pushing out of the theater in a current of people, and she was edging the other way in a dark blue jacket. I hardly recognized her with her eyes downcast, her face made up. But beautiful. \"I've been looking all over for you,\" I said. \"Mary. Call me, write me.\" She smiled, a little like the Mary I used to know, and she was gone. I knew I would never have a friend quite like her. So I went out in a white dress, a white coat, with a rich boy. And I hated myself for my hypocrasy. I love Mary. Betsy is nothing but fun; hysterical fun. Mary is me ... what I would be if I had been born of Italian parents on Linden Street. She is something vital, an artist's model, life. She can be rude, undependable, and she is more to me than all the pretty, well-to-do, artificial girls I could ever meet. Maybe it's my ego. Maybe I crave someone who will never be my rival. But with her I can be honest. She could be a prostitute, and I would not give a damn; I'll never deny her as a friend ... 6. Today is the first of August. It is hot, steamy and wet. It is raining. I am tempted to write a poem. But I remember what it said on one rejection slip: After a heavy rainfall, poems titled RAIN pour in from across the nation. 7. I love people. Everybody. I love them, I think, as a stamp collector loves his collection. Every story, every incident, every bit of conversation is raw material for me. My love's not impersonal yet not wholly subjective either. I would like to be everyone, a cripple, a dying man, a whore, and then come back to write about my thoughts, my emotions, as that person. But I am not omniscient. I have to live my life, and it is the only one I'll ever have. And you cannot regard your own life with objective curiosity all the time ... 8. With me, the present is forever, and forever is always shifting, flowing, melting. This second is life. And when it is gone it is dead. But you can't start over with each new second. You have to judge by what is dead. It's like quicksand ... hopeless from the start. A story, a picture, can renew sensation a little, but not enough, not enough. Nothing is real except the present, and already, I feel the weight of centuries smothering me. Some girl a hundred years ago once lived as I do. And she is dead. I am the present, but I know I, too, will pass. The high moment, the burning flash, come and are gone, continuous quicksand. And I don't want to die. 9. Some things are hard to write about. After something happens to you, you go to write it down, and either you over dramatize it or underplay it, exaggerate the wrong parts or ignore the important ones. At any rate, you never write it quite the way you want to. I've just got to put down what happened to me this afternoon. I can't tell mother; not yet, anyway. She was in my room when I came home, fussing with clothes, and she didn't even sense that something had happened. She just kept scolding and chattering on and on. So I couldn't stop her and tell her. No matter how it comes out, I have to write it. It rained all afternoon at the farm, and I was cold and wet, my hair under a silk print kerchief, my red ski jacket over my sweatshirt. I had worked hard on beans all afternoon and picked over three bushels. Since it was five o'clock, people were leaving, and I was waiting beside the cars for my ride home. Kathy had just come up, and as she got on her bike she called, \"Here comes Ilo.\" I looked, and sure enough, there he was, coming up the road in his old khaki shirt with his familiar white handkerchief tied around his head. I was on conversational terms with him since that day we worked together in the strawberry field. He had given me a pen and ink sketch of the farm, drawn with detail and assurance. Now he was working on a sketch of one of the boys. So I called, \"Have you finished John's picture?\" \"Oh, ya, ya,\" he smiled. \"Come and see. Your last chance.\" He had promised to show it to me when he was done, so I ran out and got in step with him on his way to the barn. That's where he lives. On the way, we passed Mary Coffee. I felt her looking at me rather strangely. Somehow I couldn't meet her eyes. \"Hullo, Mary,\" Ilo said. \"Hello, Ilo,\" Mary said in an oddly colorless voice. We walked by Ginny, Sally, and a crowd of kids keeping dry in the tractor shed. A roar went up as we passed. A singsong, \"Oh, Sylvia.\" My cheeks burned. \"Why do they have to tease me?\" I asked. Ilo just laughed. He was walking very fast. \"We're going home in a little while,\" Milton yelled from the washroom. I nodded and kept walking, looking at the ground. Then we were at the barn, a huge place, a giant high ceilinged room smelling of horses and damp hay. It was dim inside; I thought I saw the figure of a person on the other side of the stalls, but I couldn't be sure. Without saying a word, Ilo had begun to mount a narrow flight of wooden stairs. \"You live up there? All these stairs?\" He kept walking up, so I followed him, hesitating at the top. \"Come in, come in,\" he said, opening a door. The picture was there, in his room. I walked over the threshold. It was a narrow place with two windows, a table full of drawing things, and a cot, covered with a dark blanket. Oranges and milk were set out on a table with a radio. \"Here,\" he held out the picture. It was a fine pencil sketch of John's head. \"Why, how do you do it? With the side of the pencil?\" It seemed of no significance then, but now I remember how Ilo had shut the door, had turned on the radio so that music came out. He talked very fast, showing me a pencil. \"See, here the lead comes out, any size.\" I was very conscious of his nearness. His blue eyes were startlingly close, looking at me boldly, with flecks of laughter in them. \"I really have to go. They will be waiting. The picture was lovely.\" Smiling, he was between me and the door. A motion. His hand closed around my arm. And suddenly his mouth was on mine, hard, vehement, his tongue darting between my lips, his arms like iron around me. \"Ilo, Ilo!\" I don't know whether I screamed or whispered, struggling to break free, my hands striking wildly, futiley against his great strength. At last he let me go, and stood back. I held my hand against my mouth, warm and bruised from his kiss. He looked at me quizzically, with something like surprised amusement as he saw that I was crying, frightened. No one ever kissed me that way before, and I stood there, flooded with longing, electric, shivering. \"Why, why,\" he made sympathetic, depreciating little noises. \"I get you some water.\" He poured me out a glass, and I drank it. He opened the door, and I stumbled blindly downstairs, past Maybelle and Robert, the little colored children, who called my name in the corrupted way kids have of pronouncing things. Past Mary Lou, their mother, who stood there, a silent, dark presence. And I was outdoors. A truck was going by. Coming from behind the barn. In it was Bernie - the horrible, short, muscular boy from the washroom. His eyes glittered with malicious delight, and he drove fast, so I could not catch up with him. Had he been in the barn? Had he seen Ilo shut the door, seen me come out? I think he must have. I walked up past the washroom to the cars. Bernie yelled out, \"Why are you crying?\" I wasn't crying. Kenny and Freddy came by on the tractor. A group of boys, going home, looked at me with a light flickering somewhere in their eyes. \"Did he kiss you?\" one asked, with a knowing smile. I felt sick. I couldn't have spoken if someone had talked to me. My voice was stuck in my throat, thick and furry. Mr. Tompkins came up to the pump to watch Kenny and Freddy run the old stock car. They were nice, but they knew. They all must know. \"There's cutie pie,\" Kenny said. \"Cutie pie and angel face.\" Freddy said. So I stood there, arms folded, staring at the whirring engine, smiling as if I was all right, as if nothing had happened. Milton sat in the rumble seat with me going home. David drove, and Andy was in front. They all looked at me with that dancing light in their eyes. David said in a stiff, strained voice, \"Everybody in the washroom was watching you go into the barn and making wisecracks.\" Milton asked about the picture. We talked a little about art and drawing. They were all so nice. I think they may have been relieved at my narrow escape; they may have expected me to cry. They knew, though, they knew. So I'm home. And tomorrow I have to face the whole damn farm. Good Lord, It might have happened in a dream. Now I can almost believe it did. But tomorrow my name will be on the tip of every tongue. I wish I could be smart, or flip, but I'm too scared. If only he hadn't kissed me. I'll have to lie and say he didn't. But they know. They all know. And what am I against so many ...? 10.

I could see my feet, my arms; there I was. I tried hard to get back in my body again ... it was such a long way to my feet. I lifted my hands, to my head; they shook.

So the rain comes down hard outside my room, and like Eddie Cohen, I say, \"... fifteen thousand years - of what?

The last time I looked at the figures, the record holder in the machisma stakes was a Scottish executive who finalised a multibillion pound deal for her employers during the first stage of labour. Even after her waters broke, she stayed at her desk, videoconferencing with her associates on the other side of the Atlantic for another three hours. She's far from the only one. There are a lot of very tough women out there, who are managing to do their very best work right through pregnancy and beyond, without causing a single ripple. So it's no longer possible to say it's impossible for a pregnant woman to work right up to her due date. But you have to ask why a woman would choose to do so.</p> <p>Are they trying to prove something? I know I was, when I was pregnant the first time. This was not just silliness on my part, although there was plenty of that, too. The social adjustments you have to make when pregnant for the first time are, if anything, more difficult than the physical adjustments. When you are accustomed to being treated like an adult, it is not pleasant to have everyone around you suddenly treat you like a child. You are always hearing that you are not to worry if your mind has turned to mush. If you raise your voice to insist that, actually, your mind is no mushier than it's ever been, no one listens.</p> <p>Everyone smiles at you indulgently and attributes your short temper to hormones. So naturally, you feel as if you have something to prove. But even if you do prove it, you may wonder later if it was worth the effort. I spent my last trimester racing against time to finish a translation.</p> <p>It seemed so important then. But all that sitting in straight, uncomfortable chairs, gasping for breath and struggling to reach the typewriter keys was for nothing, as no one wanted to publish it. I would have been better off putting my feet up. I would also have adjusted more easily to motherhood had I not felt compelled to take papers into hospital.</p> <p>I went into my second pregnancy wanting to let my body set the pace. I was determined not to work until the bitter end this time. But I had a book to finish. I had been working on it for four years and wanted to draw a line under it to devote full attention to the baby. I drove myself so hard to meet this deadline that I came down with pneumonia. I had to spend the last five weeks of pregnancy in bed.</p> <p>So when I was pregnant for the third time, eight years later, I had been cured of all delusions. I knew how hard it was to strike a balance, and also how important it was. But this time it was out of my hands. I couldn't stop work because I was single with two young children to support.</p> <p>I couldn't even take maternity leave because I didn't have a proper job. I had a column. I was on a retainer, which meant that my employers could let me go whenever they felt like it. So when they asked me to file two extra columns in my last two weeks, in addition to the ones I would be filing anyway, I was quick to say how delighted I was by the prospect. But, really, I wasn't. Really, I was in pain. I filed my second standby piece on a Monday, and my regular piece on a Tuesday. On the Wednesday, I gave birth. I filed another column six days later.

But where there is a will and a house full of children who depend on your earnings, there is always a way. This is not to say I sailed through my last pregnancy two years later. I had trouble walking, was short of breath and got very dizzy after two hours on the computer. But I still managed to put in eight- or nine-hour days right through to the day my daughter was born. And I was back at the computer two days later. I had this article to do, you see, and I had missed the deadline. The subject I was meant to be writing about was scorn.</p> <p>Scorn was certainly what I got from the midwife when she caught me at the screen. \"You should be focussing on your baby,\" was what she said.

Then, the moment you have a chance to put your feet up, you have to hear how silly and irresponsible and unmaternal you are to be working so late. You stand accused of not caring for your children, of having \"other priorities\". This is the cruellest accusation of all.</p> <p>There may be a few women out there who work late because they are unmaternal, but most of us who've worked right through our pregnancies have done so because we have no other option.

A hand shot out and grabbed my ankle. He was a fighter, Ewan, I'll give him that. I picked up a poker, took aim between his eyes and pressed down, waiting for a definite juicy crunch. He didn't move again. </p> <p>He had to die, did Ewan. I couldn't let anything come between me and my Billy. Billy was only 23 years old, 15 years my junior.

We loved each other, me and Billy. </p> <p>Ewan never did understand why I wanted to kill myself. He was a surgeon and we had met when I was taken to hospital after being knocked down by a carriage. My leg got infected and he had to saw it off. I blacked out as he severed the membranes and grabbed the jaw-tooth saw and started working it through my marrow, turning the sawdust in the blood box into a mulch of black gruel.

We went back to the house and cut Ewan's body up. The legs and thighs came off easy, but the knife got caught in his neckbone as I tried to saw his head off. We wrapped the parts in the tarpaulin and took them to the river. We weighted the legs and chucked them in and they sank with a glorious plop. But the head, with Ewan's stupid grin taunting us, floated. We fished it out and lit a bonfire. The flesh does not burn to ashes, as you might think. It stays like charred meat and his teeth are coated shiny brown from the smoke and the fat. </p> <p>\"Why did you not look for your child?\" says Billy. \"He died,\" I says. \"One day I went back to the hospital and was just told he had died.\" He asks me if I saw the grave and I tell him I never went because, and this is shameful, I went to prison. For murder. I was let out because it turned out the mother had done it, but God knows, I had wanted to kill that baby. For being alive when mine wasn't. </p> <p>We're home free, now, me and Billy. We're on the way to Folkestone to start again in France. Only I don't tell Billy that I did once go to see where he was buried. And the gravestone said, Laura Blundy.

The virus randomly chooses a recently opened file from the Start/Document folder in the Microsoft Start menu and attaches it to the email as a .vbs file. Experts at Symantec AntiVirus Research Centre, one of the industry's largest dedicated team of virus experts, with offices in the US, Japan, Australia and the Netherlands, said each time the virus spreads it mutates itself to evade detection. Clicking on the attachment will activate the virus. Like Love Bug, it will send itself to everybody in the user's address book. It will then destroy most of the files on the hard drive, rendering the computer useless until the operating system is reinstalled. As with the Love Bug, only recipients running Microsoft's Outlook email programme for Windows are vulnerable and there is no danger if the attachment is not opened, virus experts said. Investigators suspect the Love Bug originated in the Philippines, where several people have been questioned. Microsoft has said it will make available a modification to Outlook next week that will warn users about suspect email attachments.",

      "body": "<p>Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble faces a nerve-jangling week as he strives to persuade his truculent and suspicious party back into the Northern Ireland peace process.</p> <p>The party's ruling council was due to meet tomorrow, but the vital vote has been put back a week. The delay is ominous, for it lays bare the deep divisions in the party and indeed in the province.</p> <p>According to this morning's Irish Times, the postponement is something of a panic measure, ordered after party managers took soundings from the 860 council members, and discovered, to their horror, that the vote was likely to go against Mr Trimble by more than two to one.</p> <p>The Unionist leader is urging his party to accept the Provisional IRA offer to start opening its arms dumps to international inspection, as a first step towards permanent disarmament.</p> <p>Mr Trimble is brave to embrace the IRA formula, which is as flawed as it is audacious. His party cohorts are understandably asking some cogent and awkward questions. How many caches will be revealed? What guarantee is there that the republicans will not reclaim their weapons? How long will the process take?</p> <p>The fact is that the Unionists have been outflanked, and they know it. If they accept the IRA proposal, they risk splitting their party. If they reject it, they will be branded as anti-peace.</p> <p>The great danger is that the party will make its acceptance conditional upon further concessions by the British and Irish governments, the ultimate arbiters of the fragile peace. Already, the Unionists are loudly rattling their sabres over reform of the Royal Ulster Constabulary - a crucial part of the wider process.</p> <p>Northern Ireland secretary Peter Mandelson has also tried to buy time, by declining republican demands for the police reforms to be accelerated.

      "bodyText": "Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble faces a nerve-jangling week as he strives to persuade his truculent and suspicious party back into the Northern Ireland peace process. The party's ruling council was due to meet tomorrow, but the vital vote has been put back a week. The delay is ominous, for it lays bare the deep divisions in the party and indeed in the province. According to this morning's Irish Times, the postponement is something of a panic measure, ordered after party managers took soundings from the 860 council members, and discovered, to their horror, that the vote was likely to go against Mr Trimble by more than two to one. The Unionist leader is urging his party to accept the Provisional IRA offer to start opening its arms dumps to international inspection, as a first step towards permanent disarmament. Mr Trimble is brave to embrace the IRA formula, which is as flawed as it is audacious. His party cohorts are understandably asking some cogent and awkward questions. How many caches will be revealed? What guarantee is there that the republicans will not reclaim their weapons? How long will the process take? The fact is that the Unionists have been outflanked, and they know it. If they accept the IRA proposal, they risk splitting their party. If they reject it, they will be branded as anti-peace. The great danger is that the party will make its acceptance conditional upon further concessions by the British and Irish governments, the ultimate arbiters of the fragile peace. Already, the Unionists are loudly rattling their sabres over reform of the Royal Ulster Constabulary - a crucial part of the wider process. Northern Ireland secretary Peter Mandelson has also tried to buy time, by declining republican demands for the police reforms to be accelerated. But he insists, quite rightly, that the RUC will indeed be transformed - and, to the Unionists' fury, renamed the Police Service of Northern Ireland. Mr Mandelson, a consummate deal-maker, is making it plain that he has little more to offer the Unionists. That message has not been lost on Mr Trimble, who has nailed his colours to the mast of power sharing. But the coming week will undoubtedly be marked by frantic horse trading, and the sound and fury of a party which has long been accustomed to dictating events, but which now finds itself backed into a take-it-or-leave-it corner.

It is the same tantalizing sensation when you almost remember a name, but don't quite reach it. I can feel it when I think of human beings, of the hints of evolution suggested by the removal of wisdom teeth, the narrowing of the jaw no longer needed to chew such roughage as it was accustomed to; the gradual disappearance of hair from the human body; the adjustment of the human eye to the fine print, the swift, colored motion of the twentieth century. The feeling comes, vague and nebulous, when I consider the prolonged adolesence of our species; the rites of birth, marriage and death; all the primitive, barbaric ceremonies streamlined to modern times. Almost, I think, the unreasoning, bestial purity was best. Oh, something is there, waiting for me. Perhaps someday the revelation will burst in upon me and I will see the other side of this monumental grotesque joke. And then I'll laugh. And then I'll know what life is.</p> <p>13. </p> <p>Tonight I wanted to step outside for a few moments before going to bed; it was so snug and stale-aired in the house. I was in my pajamas, my freshly washed hair up on curlers. So I tried to open the front door. The lock snapped as I turned it; I tried the handle. The door wouldn't open. Annoyed, I turned the handle the other way. No response. I twisted the lock; there were only four possible combinations of handle and lock positions, and still the door stuck, white, blank and enigmatic. I glanced up. Through the glass square, high in the door, I saw a block of sky, pierced by the sharp black points of the pines across the street. And there was the moon, almost full, luminous and yellow, behind the trees. I felt suddenly breathless, stifled. I was trapped, with the tantalizing little square of night above me, and the warm, feminine atmosphere of the house enveloping me in its thick, feathery smothering embrace. </p> <p>14. </p> <p>This morning I am at low ebb. I did not sleep well last night, waking, tossing, and dreaming sordid, incoherent little dreams. I awoke, my head heavy, feeling as if I had just emerged from a swim in a pool of warm polluted water. My skin was greasy, my hair stiff, oily, and my hands as if I had touched something slimy and unclean. The thick August air does not help. I sit here lumpishly, an ache at the back of my neck. I feel that even if I washed myself all day in cold clear water, I could not rinse the sticky, untidy film away; nor could I rid my mouth of the furry unpleasant taste of unbrushed teeth. </p> <p>15. </p> <p>Tonight, for a moment, all was at peace inside. I came out of the house-across-the-street a little before twelve, sick with unfulfilled longing, alone, self-reviling. And there, miraculously was the August night. It had just rained, and the air was thick with warm damp and fog. The moon, full, pregnant with light, showed strangely from behind the small frequent clouds, poised like a picture puzzle that had been broken, with light in back, outlining each piece. There seemed to be no wind, but the leaves of the trees stirred, restless, and the water fell from them in great drops on the pavement, with a sound like that of people walking down the street. There was the peculiar smell of mould, dead leaves, decay, in the air. The two lights over the front steps were haloed with a hazy nimbus of mist, and strange insects fluttered up against the screen, fragile, wing-thin and blinded, dazed, numbed by the brilliance. Lightning, heat lightning flicked off and on, as if some stage hand were toying with the light switch. Two crickets, deep in the cracks in the granite steps, sang a sweet, haunting-thin trill. And because it was my home, I loved them. The air flowed about me like thick molasses, and the shadows from the moon and street lamp split like schizophrenic blue phantoms, grotesque and faintly repetitious. </p> <p>16. </p> <p>Upstairs, in the bright, white, sterile cubicle of the bathroom, smelling of warm flesh and toothpaste, I bent over the washbowl in unthinking ritual, washing the proscribed areas, worshipping the glittering chromium, the light that clattered back and forth, brittle, blinding, from the faucets. Hot and cold; cleanliness coming in smooth scented green bars; hairs in thin, penciled lines, curving on the white enamel; the colored prescriptions, the hard, glassed-in jars, the bottles that can cure the symptoms of a cold or send you to sleep within an hour. And then to bed, in the same potentially fertile air, scented of lavendar, lace curtains and the warm feline odor like musk, waiting to assimilate you - everywhere the pallid waiting. And you are the moving epitome of all this. Of you, by you, for you. God, is this all it is, the ricocheting down the corridor of laughter and tears? Of self-worship and self-loathing? Of glory and disgust? </p> <p>17. </p> <p>A little thing, like children putting flowers in my hair, can fill up the widening cracks in my self-assurance like soothing lanolin. I was sitting out on the steps today, uneasy with fear and discontent. Peter, (the little boy-across-the-street) with the pointed pale face, the grave blue eyes and the slow fragile smile came bringing his adorable sister Libby of the flaxen braids and the firm, lyrically-formed child-body. They stood shyly for a little, and then Peter picked a white petunia and put it in my hair. Thus began an enchanting game, where I sat very still, while Libby ran to and fro gathering petunias, and Peter stood by my side, arranging the blossoms. I closed my eyes to feel more keenly the lovely delicate-child-hands, gently tucking flower after flower into my curls. \"And now a white one,\" the lisp was soft and tender. Pink, crimson, scarlet, white ... the faint pungent odor of the petunias was hushed and sweet. And all my hurts were smoothed away. Something about the frank, guileless blue eyes, the beautiful young bodies, the brief scent of the dying flowers smote me like the clean quick cut of a knife. And the blood of love welled up in my heart with a slow pain. </p> <p>18. </p> <p>Now I'll never see him again, and maybe it's a good thing. He walked out of my life last night for once and for all. I know with sickening certainty that it's the end. There were just those two dates we had, and the time he came over with the boys, and tonight. Yet I liked him too much - way too much, and I ripped him out of my heart so it wouldn't get to hurt me more than it did. Oh, he's magnetic, he's charming; you could fall into his eyes. Let's face it: his sex appeal was unbearably strong. I wanted to know him - the thoughts, the ideas behind the handsome, confident, wise-cracking mask. \"I've changed,\" he told me. \"You would have liked me three years ago. Now I'm a wiseguy.\" We sat together for a few hours on the porch, talking, and staring at nothing. Then the friction increased, centered. His nearness was electric in itself. \"Can't you see,\" he said. \"I want to kiss you.\" So he kissed me, hungrily, his eyes shut, his hand warm, curved burning into my stomach. \"I wish I hated you,\" I said. \"Why did you come?\" \"Why? I wanted your company. Alby and Pete were going to the ball game, and I couldn't see that. Warrie and Jerry were going drinking; couldn't see that either.\" It was past eleven; I walked to the door with him and stepped outside into the cool August night. \"Come here,\" he said. \"I'll whisper something: I like you, but not too much. I don't want to like anybody too much.\" Then it hit me and I just blurted, \"I like people too much or not at all. I've got to go down deep, to fall into people, to really know them.\" He was definite, \"Nobody knows me.\" So that was it; the end. \"Goodbye for good, then,\" I said. He looked hard at me, a smile twisting his mouth, \"You lucky kid; you don't know how lucky you are.\" I was crying quietly, my face contorted. \"Stop it!\" The words came like knife thrusts, and then gentleness, \"In case I don't see you, have a nice time at Smith.\" \"Have a hell of a nice life,\" I said. And he walked off down the path with his jaunty, independent stride. And I stood there where he left me, tremulous with love and longing, weeping in the dark. That night it was hard to get to sleep. </p> <p>19. </p> <p>Today the doorbell rang; it was little Peter. So I came out and sat on the front steps with him. I could sit by the hour listening to his prattling. He was jealous of Bob, asking in a small tight voice, \"Who was that boy over your house? Who does he like best, Warren or you?\" And then, \"He called me pipsqueak. If you had a baby would you call him pipsqueak?\" \"I'm not tan,\" he continued. \"It's dirt. I don't like the looks of dirt, but I like the feel of it. Clean doesn't feel good because you're all wet.\" He played with Warren. I went up to my room, and I heard a commotion outside. Peter had climbed to the level of the window in the little maple tree and was shaking the leaves down. - </p> <p>20. </p> <p>From a letter to Ed - \"Your letter came just now ... The one about your walk in the city, about war. You don't know quite what it did to me. My mental fear, which can be at times forced into the background, reared up and caught me in the pit of my stomach; it became a physical nausea which wouldn't let me eat breakfast. </p> <p> Let's face it: I'm scared, scared and frozen. First, I guess, I'm afraid for myself ... the old primitive urge for survival. It's getting so I live every moment with terrible intensity. Last night, driving back from Boston, I lay back in the car and let the colored lights come at me, the music from the radio, the reflection of the guy driving. It all flowed over me with a screaming ache of pain ... remember, remember, this is now, and now, and now. Live it, feel it, cling to it. I want to become acutely aware of all I've taken for granted. When you feel that this may be the good-bye, the last time, it hits you harder. </p> <p> I've got to have something. I want to stop it all, the whole monumental grotesque joke, before it's too late. But writing poems and letters doesn't seem to do much good. The big men are all deaf; they don't want to hear the little squeaking as they walk across the street in cleated boots. Ed, I guess this all sounds a bit frantic. I guess I am. When you catch your mother, the childhood symbol of security and rightness, crying desolately in the kitchen; when you look at your tall, dreamy-eyed kid brother and think that all his potentialities in the line of science are going to be cut off before he gets a chance ... it kind of gets you. </p> <p>21. </p> <p>Here I sit in the deep cushioned armchair, the crickets rasping, buzzing, chirring outside. It's the library, my favorite room, with the floor a medieval mosaic of flat square stones the color of old book-bindings ... rust, copper, tawny orange, pepper-brown, maroon. And there are deep comfortable maroon leather chairs with the leather peeling off, revealing a marbled pattern of ridiculous pink. The books, all that you would fill your rainy days with, line the shelves; friendly, fingered volumes. So I sit here, smiling as I think in my fragmentary way: \"Woman is but an engine of ecstasy, a mimic of the earth from the ends of her curled hair to her red-lacquered nails.\" Then I think, remembering the family of beautiful children that lie asleep upstairs, \"Isn't it better to give in to the pleasant cycles of reproduction, the easy, comforting presence of a man around the house?\" I remember Liz, her face white, delicate as an ash on the wind; her red lips staining the cigarette; her full breasts under the taut black jersey. She said to me, \"But think how happy you can make a man someday.\" Yes, I'm thinking, and so far it's all right. But then I do a flipover and reach out in my mind to E., seeing a baseball game, maybe, perhaps watching television, or roaring with careless laughter at some dirty joke with the boys, beer cans lying about green and shiny gold, and ash trays. I spiral back to me, sitting here, swimming, drowning, sick with longing. I have too much conscience injected in me to break customs without disasterous effects; I can only lean enviously against the boundary and hate, hate, hate the boys who can dispel sexual hunger freely, without misgiving, and be whole, while I drag out from date to date in soggy desire, always unfulfilled. The whole thing sickens me. </p> <p>22. </p> <p>Yes, I was infatuated with you; I am still. No one has ever heightened such a keen capacity of physical sensation in me. I cut you out because I couldn't stand being a passing fancy. Before I give my body, I must give my thoughts, my mind, my dreams. And you weren't having any of those. </p> <p>23. </p> <p>There is so much hurt in this game of searching for a mate, of testing, trying. And you realize suddenly that you forgot it was a game, and turn away in tears. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/firstchapters/story/0,6761,222712,00.html\">Back</a></p>",

And there are deep comfortable maroon leather chairs with the leather peeling off, revealing a marbled pattern of ridiculous pink. The books, all that you would fill your rainy days with, line the shelves; friendly, fingered volumes. So I sit here, smiling as I think in my fragmentary way: \"Woman is but an engine of ecstasy, a mimic of the earth from the ends of her curled hair to her red-lacquered nails.\" Then I think, remembering the family of beautiful children that lie asleep upstairs, \"Isn't it better to give in to the pleasant cycles of reproduction, the easy, comforting presence of a man around the house?\" I remember Liz, her face white, delicate as an ash on the wind; her red lips staining the cigarette; her full breasts under the taut black jersey. She said to me, \"But think how happy you can make a man someday.\" Yes, I'm thinking, and so far it's all right. But then I do a flipover and reach out in my mind to E., seeing a baseball game, maybe, perhaps watching television, or roaring with careless laughter at some dirty joke with the boys, beer cans lying about green and shiny gold, and ash trays. I spiral back to me, sitting here, swimming, drowning, sick with longing. I have too much conscience injected in me to break customs without disasterous effects; I can only lean enviously against the boundary and hate, hate, hate the boys who can dispel sexual hunger freely, without misgiving, and be whole, while I drag out from date to date in soggy desire, always unfulfilled. The whole thing sickens me. 22. Yes, I was infatuated with you; I am still. No one has ever heightened such a keen capacity of physical sensation in me. I cut you out because I couldn't stand being a passing fancy. Before I give my body, I must give my thoughts, my mind, my dreams. And you weren't having any of those. 23. There is so much hurt in this game of searching for a mate, of testing, trying. And you realize suddenly that you forgot it was a game, and turn away in tears. Back",

      "bodyText": "The government yesterday resumed its efforts to repeal the section 28 law, which bans local authorities from promoting homosexuality in schools, but infuriated teaching unions by insisting that they will have a legal duty to follow new guidelines on sex education. A new amendment to the learning and skills bill, which has been tabled by the Department for Education and Employment, is designed to place responsibility for sex education in schools firmly on teachers, governors and parents, with no powers for local education authorities. But ministers want schools to be \"statutorily\" obliged to follow the guidance. This move was condemned by teaching unions as \"unnecessary interference\" which would also increase teachers' workloads. In a further change designed to dampen fears about \"gay propaganda\" being sent direct to schools, health authorities are being ordered to ensure that any material they produce is in line with the guidance and appropriate to the age, religious and cultural background of the youngsters concerned. The government's attempts to repeal section 28 of the 1988 Local Government Act have so far been frustrated by the House of Lords, which first voted to keep it and then rejected a compromise clause in the learning and skills bill. The new amendment is likely to be debated in the Commons during the bill's committee stage next week. The education and employment secretary, David Blunkett, was understood to be furious that the Tories have maintained their opposition to the repealing of section 28, even after he introduced new guidelines which highlight the importance of stable relationships. Yesterday he said: \"Effective sex and relationships education is important in preparing young people for adulthood and in reducing teenage pregnancies. \"However, parents are understandably concerned to ensure that what is taught is appropriate for the age of their child and for use in schools. This amendment gives statutory underpinning to our guidance, which will ensure that governors properly consult parents in developing their school's curriculum\". He claimed that with the new guidance and the amendment, parental rights would be \"strengthened and unaffected\" by the repeal of section 28, which was originally introduced by the Tories. But the shadow education secretary, Theresa May, said: \"Section 28 goes much further than sex education and this does not replace it.\" The forthcoming guidance from the DfEE makes it clear that sex education should be set within the wider frame work for personal social and health development which was issued to schools last year. The second largest teaching union, the National Union of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers, warned that it was unnecessary and would mean that every school's sex education policy required approval by governors and parents. Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary, said: \"This is something schools do not need and appears to have been done in a forlorn attempt to appease the bishops in the House of Lords. \"We may well add this to the list of duties which our members would be prepared to boycott\". John Dunford, general secretary of the Secondary Heads Association, said: \"Teachers do not need statutory guidance in an area which is totally inappropriate for the government to interfere in. \"If anything, this could make teachers less likely to teach sex education.\"",

      "bodyText": "Ministers planning the biggest overhaul of Britain's sex offence laws for a century are set to include new definitions or offences relating to prostitution, pimping, rape, oral sex, incest and indecent exposure. The package, sometimes reforming laws dating back to the Napoleonic wars, will also offer fresh equalising measures to protect homosexuals on top of the planned cut in the age of consent to 16 for gays. Laws labelling acts such as males kissing in public as gross indecency and open to five years imprisonment will be scrapped. The reforms will also extend protection for children from sexual abuse by figures in positions of authority and trust. Ministers are bracing themselves for a backlash in an area of huge religious and political controversy following the rows over section 28 and the age of consent votes. They will say the reforms are required to prevent a breach of the European Convention on Human Rights and stress that the package has been prepared following wide consultation with religious groups, charities, lawyers and specialists. The measures have been drawn up by civil servants working on the sexual offences review group, a body set up by the home secretary, Jack Straw. After lengthy consultations, its report has just gone to ministers and will be published next month. The expectation is that legislation will follow. Mr Straw has told the Commons that the current sex laws are anachronistic and need wholesale review. He has also told gay campaign groups that equalising the age of consent is not a sufficient move to end discrimination against gays. He has commissioned internal Home Office research suggesting the police and courts are finding it difficult to bring convictions in cases where the victim knows the alleged rapist, so-called date rape. The reforms will follow the advice of the lord chief justice and reject the idea of rape offences graded according to the degree of coercion or violence used. It will, however, attempt to respond to concern over low conviction rates by widening evidence of proof that the woman's consent was not freely given to include silence, ambiguous behaviour and absence of clearly expressed unwillingness. The Labour MP for Crosby, Claire Curtis-Thomas, said: \"It cannot be right that only 18% of cases brought by women end in a conviction.\" She said a constituent had been gang raped by four men, and as a result was having a child. She failed to win a conviction and one of the men was now able to demand access and custody. The reforms are also expected to call for action to do more to help young male victims of rape. Diana Lamplugh, from the Suzy Lamplugh Trust, said: \"These are some of the most vulnerable witnesses and the number of cases is massively under-reported.\" The current law shows a difference between men and women. Male importuning is an imprisonable offence whether it is for prostitution or for contact. By contrast, for women it is an offence only for prostitution, and then it is not imprisonable. The reforms are also likely to include changes to penalties for incest so that incest can be defined as sex between an adopted parent or mother-in-law or father-in-law and the child. At present, incest has to be between blood relations. Investigation of laws relating to sex offences has thrown up a series of anomalies. Men and women face different charges if they have sex with underage children with consent. In a further anomaly, foreplay can be classified as indecent assault, leading to 10 years, while unlawful intercourse can produce only a two-year sentence. On prostitution, it is not an offence to be a prostitute or commit a sexual act for money, but it is a crime to solicit in a public place or for two prostitutes to operate together in the same premises. It is a crime for a man, but not a woman, to live on the immoral earnings of a woman. A woman can be convicted only of directing or controlling prostitutes. Finally, only men and not women can be found guilty of indecent exposure. Welcoming the expected reforms, Eban Harris, the Liberal Democrat MP, said: \"These reforms will start to bring our sex laws out of the 19th century, if not yet into the 21st century.\" Stonewall, the gay rights pressure group, refused to comment on the package, largely because it has been one of the groups involved in drawing up the proposals. Children's groups are expecting the reforms to extend the groups to whom special protection must be given including the mentally and physically disabled. But the Home Office will be concerned that the reforms wil not simply be seen as modernisation of a legal jumble, but as another attempt to extend gay rights, partly under pressure from the European Convention on Human Rights.",

Dishes change every four weeks or so, and ingredients are well-sourced. Come early for the \u00a310 two-course deal: very few dishes are barred to the more frugal diner and portions are generous. The atmosphere, too, doesn't falter, even at this early hour (you must order by 7.30), thanks to chatty Claphamites lounging on the orange banquettes. Staff, like the food, seem to have been gathered from around the globe, and greet customers as if they eat here every night.

Tel: 020-7720 5433 </p> <p> It's as quick as your legs can take you at this DIY wok diner. All you can eat for \u00a313 or so, with the advantage that you select the raw ingredients (rather than limp and elderly pizza), and take them to a chef, who will add chilli, garlic, noodles, herbs and sauces of your choice before fierily cooking them in front of you. It's fast, but the lure of multiple trips to the woks might mean that you miss your 15-minute limit. A word of warning: go at a busy time and you'll find yourself in a queue behind a 20-strong birthday party - this is most definitely a place for groups, not for a quiet nibble. At least the fresh ingredients are restocked frequently, so you won't be left with the scraps. </p> <p><strong>Creamy green ravioli</strong></p> <p>2 packs of chilled ravioli (any type) </p> <p>1 head of broccoli/packet of French beans </p> <p>1 jar of Sacla creamy basil sauce </p> <p>3tbsp strained Greek yoghurt </p> <p>1 Divide broccoli into florets (or top and tail beans and cut in half). </p> <p>2 Empty the sauce and yoghurt into a non-stick pan.

Not content with delivering fresh organic produce to your door, this firm based in London's New Covent Garden market will wash, peel, slice, baton or shred your vegetables too. Prices start from \u00a315.90 for the no-effort boxes. </p> <p><strong> Pros: </strong> Ultra-fresh veg from small organic producers across the UK and Europe, and an emphasis on traditional fruit and veg from traditional growing regions. Organic pasta, sauces and oils too, for the easy way to a quick meal. </p> <p><strong> Cons: </strong> Too little information online about ordering and delivery, which at the moment is by phone, fax or email only. </p> <p><strong> Coming soon: </strong> Online ordering. </p> <p> <strong>On the menu: mostarda di Cremona</strong></p> <p><strong> Sounds a bit like mustard.</strong> Well it is, but not in the English sense. </p> <p><strong> No Colman's in sight?</strong> Not a driblet. It's made with fruit. </p> <p><strong> Fruit? </strong> Originally quinces or grapes, but now with pears, cherries, figs and apricots, stewed together in a heavy syrup made peppy with mustard. </p> <p><strong> Ah, hence the name. Who can we thank for this exotic combo? </strong> The citizens of Cremona in northern Italy. Home of Antonio Stradivarius. </p> <p><strong> How would he have eaten his mostarda? </strong> As the classic condiment for bollito misto (boiled meats).

Tel: 020-7622 1199 A world of influences come together at this smart south London restaurant, thanks to chef Darryn Pitman: don't be surprised to see springbok alongside rocket and seabass on the menu. Dishes change every four weeks or so, and ingredients are well-sourced. Come early for the \u00a310 two-course deal: very few dishes are barred to the more frugal diner and portions are generous. The atmosphere, too, doesn't falter, even at this early hour (you must order by 7.30), thanks to chatty Claphamites lounging on the orange banquettes. Staff, like the food, seem to have been gathered from around the globe, and greet customers as if they eat here every night. Which some of them probably do. Quick bites . . . where to eat out in under 15 minutes Tiger Lil's , 16a Clapham Common Southside, London SW4. Tel: 020-7720 5433 It's as quick as your legs can take you at this DIY wok diner. All you can eat for \u00a313 or so, with the advantage that you select the raw ingredients (rather than limp and elderly pizza), and take them to a chef, who will add chilli, garlic, noodles, herbs and sauces of your choice before fierily cooking them in front of you. It's fast, but the lure of multiple trips to the woks might mean that you miss your 15-minute limit. A word of warning: go at a busy time and you'll find yourself in a queue behind a 20-strong birthday party - this is most definitely a place for groups, not for a quiet nibble. At least the fresh ingredients are restocked frequently, so you won't be left with the scraps. Creamy green ravioli 2 packs of chilled ravioli (any type) 1 head of broccoli/packet of French beans 1 jar of Sacla creamy basil sauce 3tbsp strained Greek yoghurt 1 Divide broccoli into florets (or top and tail beans and cut in half). 2 Empty the sauce and yoghurt into a non-stick pan. Heat gently. 3 Add ravioli and vegetables to pan of boiling water and cook as instructed for the ravioli. 4 Drain vegetables and ravioli and place in serving dish. 5 Pour the sauce/yoghurt mix over the ravioli and shake gently to coat. CA Chodan, Maidenhead, Berks. Cheat's kitchen : Food on the net www.farmaround.co.uk Just when you thought it couldn't get any easier . . . Not content with delivering fresh organic produce to your door, this firm based in London's New Covent Garden market will wash, peel, slice, baton or shred your vegetables too. Prices start from \u00a315.90 for the no-effort boxes. Pros: Ultra-fresh veg from small organic producers across the UK and Europe, and an emphasis on traditional fruit and veg from traditional growing regions. Organic pasta, sauces and oils too, for the easy way to a quick meal. Cons: Too little information online about ordering and delivery, which at the moment is by phone, fax or email only. Coming soon: Online ordering. On the menu: mostarda di Cremona Sounds a bit like mustard. Well it is, but not in the English sense. No Colman's in sight? Not a driblet. It's made with fruit. Fruit? Originally quinces or grapes, but now with pears, cherries, figs and apricots, stewed together in a heavy syrup made peppy with mustard. Ah, hence the name. Who can we thank for this exotic combo? The citizens of Cremona in northern Italy. Home of Antonio Stradivarius. How would he have eaten his mostarda? As the classic condiment for bollito misto (boiled meats). But it goes well with meats cooked most ways. If you have any hints for Cheat's kitchen, send them to The Guzzler, The Guardian, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER.",

Most cricket writers were in Somerset for the funeral of Chris Lander, the popular cricket correspondent of The Mirror, who has died aged 59 after a brief battle with cancer.</p> <p>Lander, who had a great sense of humour, would have savoured two of Lloyd's examples of the pettiness of some officials. In Anything But Murder (CollinsWillow, \u00a316.99, published May 16), Lloyd recalls receiving an \"insensitive\" letter from the ECB as he was leaving the England coaching job. It asked him to return his mobile phone, and his ECB Barclaycard, \"cut into two pieces\", and to \"make immediate (underlined) arrangements to return the ECB car to Lord's.\" This was before the World Cup had even reached the semi-final stage. Lloyd felt he was being chased, \"as if they felt sure I would scarper with the family silver.\"</p> <p>A month earlier, on the morning of the World Cup opener against Sri Lanka at Lord's, Lloyd suffered \"a classic example of MCC small-mindedness\". As he conducted an England fielding practice on the outfield, an MCC steward bore down on the group, calling: \"Who is in charge here?\" Lloyd replied: \"I am\". The steward shot back: \"Have you had permission to be on here throwing balls at stumps?\".</p> <p>The practice session continued, but as Lloyd puts it: \"None of us could quite believe this. Here we were, the eyes of the nation upon us as we started the quest to win a World Cup at our own headquarters....and some chap in a blazer was asking if we had permission to be on the field.

Bumble was booked into the Marriott by his publishers, who had no idea England would be there. Aware of the potential for embarrassment, Lloyd switched to another hotel.</p> <p>Meanwhile Zimbabwe are further afield - back in the five-star Royal Garden Hotel, High Street Ken, where they stayed for their World Cup matches at Lord's and The Oval. The Royal Garden was designated the \"official headquarters\" hotel for all visiting World Cup squads, even though it had never previously played host to international cricket teams.</p> <p>This time, Zimbabwe officials made clear that they would look no further for their team's visits to the capital. Barry Dudleston, the first-class umpire and tour operator who's handling the tourists' arrangements, says: \"The players enjoy being fairly central.

The bulk of the bill, incidentally, is picked up by the ECB.</p> <p> This week, the Royal Garden has none of the buzz which surrounded the World Cup, when \"Carnival of Cricket\" flags flew outside and recognisable faces thronged the lobby. On one memorable night, 36 hours before the Final, some South African players, heartbroken after their semi-final defeat by Australia, were urging any Pakistan player they came across in the lobby to hammer the Aussies for them.

      "body": "<p>This week has highlighted the most serious challenge facing the Blair government, which isn't health, education, or the euro, but defence. The government announced a \u00a31bn contract to buy missiles from a European consortium, just as we watched (\"proud - and concerned\", as the New York Times puts it) our troops trying to sort out the intractable problems of Sierra Leone.</p> <p>Although Robin Cook and Geoff Hoon clearly understand the concern, that getting into Freetown is easier than getting out, they don't mention the deeper problem, which is how it is all to be paid for. In no other field is there such a frightening dissonance between ends and means, between the government's theory and practice, between interventionist rhetoric and cheese-paring reality.</p> <p>Every new mission shows up the fact that the armed forces now operate on a shoestring. A leaked report from the Commons public accounts committee has revealed that in the Kosovo campaign last spring the RAF's stocks of laser-guided bombs ran critically low, tents were almost useless, and morphine supplies were near their use-by date.</p> <p>Our armed forces were being run down well before the end of the cold war and the supposed peace dividend. You can see this on an everyday basis. Reviewing books on the Korean war recently, I couldn't help noticing that most of the famous regiments which fought there no more than 50 years ago - Glosters, Northumberland Fusiliers, 8th Royal Irish Hussars, King's Own Scottish Borderers - no longer exist. This country has fewer men under arms today than it did in the 1780s.</p> <p>All those reductions have been made to save money. Defence spending has been on a falling curve. In 1951, the proportion of government spending which went on defence was 24%. In 1961 it was 18%; in 1997 less than 7%.

      "bodyText": "This week has highlighted the most serious challenge facing the Blair government, which isn't health, education, or the euro, but defence. The government announced a \u00a31bn contract to buy missiles from a European consortium, just as we watched (\"proud - and concerned\", as the New York Times puts it) our troops trying to sort out the intractable problems of Sierra Leone. Although Robin Cook and Geoff Hoon clearly understand the concern, that getting into Freetown is easier than getting out, they don't mention the deeper problem, which is how it is all to be paid for. In no other field is there such a frightening dissonance between ends and means, between the government's theory and practice, between interventionist rhetoric and cheese-paring reality. Every new mission shows up the fact that the armed forces now operate on a shoestring. A leaked report from the Commons public accounts committee has revealed that in the Kosovo campaign last spring the RAF's stocks of laser-guided bombs ran critically low, tents were almost useless, and morphine supplies were near their use-by date. Our armed forces were being run down well before the end of the cold war and the supposed peace dividend. You can see this on an everyday basis. Reviewing books on the Korean war recently, I couldn't help noticing that most of the famous regiments which fought there no more than 50 years ago - Glosters, Northumberland Fusiliers, 8th Royal Irish Hussars, King's Own Scottish Borderers - no longer exist. This country has fewer men under arms today than it did in the 1780s. All those reductions have been made to save money. Defence spending has been on a falling curve. In 1951, the proportion of government spending which went on defence was 24%. In 1961 it was 18%; in 1997 less than 7%. Given the choice of guns or butter, we have chosen butter, or at any rate the NHS and invalidity benefit. \"And a good thing too\", the old anti-militarists of the left will say. But the one person who cannot say that is Tony Blair. He wants guns as well as butter - and he has forgotten that what undid the Attlee government was the attempt to build a lavish welfare state while also maintaining huge imperial and military commitments, when the country could barely afford either, let alone both. There is an honourable case for absolute pacifism, even if most of us can't bring ourselves to accept it, and there is an excellent case for doing as Costa Rica did more than 50 years ago when it abolished its armed forces. \"Defence\" is an Orwellian word at the best of times, and in much of the world \"defence forces\" are used either for aggressive wars abroad or for oppressing the populace at home. Maybe the best case of all is for the \"pacificism\" advocated by the 19th-century radicals: keep armed forces, but for defence in the strict sense. This country might have been a garden, John Bright claimed in one rhetorical flourish, if it had \"adopted the principle of non-intervention in every case where her interests were not directly and obviously assailed\". That is not at all the position of our bellicose prime minister. Neither pacifist nor pacificist, he is so far from a non-interventionist that he could have borrowed Michael Heseltine's industrial boast: Blair wants to intervene militarily before breakfast, lunch and dinner. He supports Nato and its bizarre eastward expansion, and the American plans for \"Star Wars Two\", a new and unimaginably expensive missile defence system. On top of that he favours a European defence initiative, he takes us into a \"progressive war\" in the Balkans, and he claims to follow an ethical foreign policy, which means intervening from Kosovo to Sierra Leone where our interests are not directly and obviously assailed.

Six weeks before France assumes the EU presidency, Paris and Berlin are eager to use what is billed as a \"seminar\" - but is actually an informal summit - to reinvigorate the relationship which was for so long the powerhouse of European postwar integration and development. Relations have been strained since Mr Schr\u00f6der's election in late 1998, and particularly since he made plain his support for Tony Blair's \"third way\" policies, an affront to the more orthodox socialism espoused by the French prime minister, Lionel Jospin. But while neither Mr Jospin nor Mr Schr\u00f6der is naturally inclined to be passionate about Europe, nor indeed naturally inclined to like the other very much, analysts say both now recognise the need - partly for domestic political reasons - to bury their differences and forget a string of minor spats. \"There's no doubt the French were worried by Schr\u00f6der,\" a diplomat in Paris said. \"They basically sulked after the business of the Blair-Schr\u00f6der pact.

If that was enough to distress Eurosceptics, he also alarmed British Europeans by arguing the need for an inner core of countries to press on towards unification once the union was enlarged, and by saying that no European project would succeed without \"the closest Franco-German cooperation\". Political observers in Berlin believe that part of Mr Fischer's aim was to raise his personal standing in Germany when his party, the Greens, is floundering. If so it paid off: even Bild Zeitung, the influential conservative tabloid, lauded him. Another factor is the perceived need to \"put the frighteners\" on London every so often by raising the threat of exclusion. Much as it may upset the Eurosceptics, London's line on that is that Europe can only benefit from a close and fruitful Franco-German relationship, as long as it does not become exclusive. Britain too recognises the need for more political impulsion behind the European project, and has no objection to different groups of countries working more closely together on different projects. What it does not want is a select inner circle of states which would automatically exclude any single partner from everything. But there is no question but that Mr Fischer has found a receptive audience for his ideas among those in Germany and France who are concerned about the evident lack of dynamism in relations between their countries. \"When France and Germany do not cooperate well on particular issues, as has been the case for the past 18 months or so, the whole European agenda suffers,\" a French government official said. \"That's why we now must make a genuine effort to find areas of agreement.\" One development in particular has pushed the issue up the political agenda: the weakness of the euro, which many commentators blame on an apparent lack of political will in the key partners in the single currency project. Mr Jospin's popularity has been sliding in recent months, and Paris observers say he is deeply concerned by the negative impact on domestic opinion - and on his image - of the euro's dramatic decline.",

The classic case is Maurice Hankey, creator of the cabinet office and architect of the official secrets regime in whose decadence we are now living. Hankey fought for years for official approval for his memoirs - not because he had turned into a whistleblower but because, and why not, he felt pride in, even part ownership of, the great events he had witnessed.</p> <p>It would be stretching the truth to say that during her tenure as director general of the Security Service Stella Rimington walked with history - though Arthur Scargill may have considered himself its personification. But she may feel a sense of achievement as one of Whitehall's top women, even fancy herself a dab hand with a pen after a lifetime of memo writing. That is for the literary editors to judge. Head prefect Sir Richard Wilson should speed her access to print. He is in the midst of a grand exercise in \"modernising\" the machinery of state, opening its upper reaches to new blood, especially women and ethnic minorities. The intelligence agencies must be no less subject to the tests of efficiency and effectiveness - or representativeness - being applied elsewhere in Whitehall. A Rimington memoir could help.</p> <p>The public might benefit, too. Even if it reads like a piece of Emmenthal, any book by her is bound to provoke yet more questions about the cost and purpose of these hidden intelligence empires. Perhaps in her retirement Dame Stella has hit upon a truth recognised by police officers high and low. Preventive work - the main function of any security service - succeeds in proportion to the public's trust in those who carry it out.</p>",

Others were determined to lift the curtain's edge and show off some of the secret world they had inhabited. The classic case is Maurice Hankey, creator of the cabinet office and architect of the official secrets regime in whose decadence we are now living. Hankey fought for years for official approval for his memoirs - not because he had turned into a whistleblower but because, and why not, he felt pride in, even part ownership of, the great events he had witnessed. It would be stretching the truth to say that during her tenure as director general of the Security Service Stella Rimington walked with history - though Arthur Scargill may have considered himself its personification. But she may feel a sense of achievement as one of Whitehall's top women, even fancy herself a dab hand with a pen after a lifetime of memo writing. That is for the literary editors to judge. Head prefect Sir Richard Wilson should speed her access to print. He is in the midst of a grand exercise in \"modernising\" the machinery of state, opening its upper reaches to new blood, especially women and ethnic minorities. The intelligence agencies must be no less subject to the tests of efficiency and effectiveness - or representativeness - being applied elsewhere in Whitehall. A Rimington memoir could help. The public might benefit, too. Even if it reads like a piece of Emmenthal, any book by her is bound to provoke yet more questions about the cost and purpose of these hidden intelligence empires. Perhaps in her retirement Dame Stella has hit upon a truth recognised by police officers high and low. Preventive work - the main function of any security service - succeeds in proportion to the public's trust in those who carry it out.",

If they are lucky, they will get a few hours' work on a construction site or in a suburban garden and some dollar bills in their hand at the end of the day. But now they and their compatriots and fellow immigrants who do the dirty cleaning jobs of corporate America have been chosen in a rather different way - as film heroes and heroines. </p> <p>La Ciudad, which opens next week, looks at the lives of illegal Latino immigrants in the \"broken promise land\" of New York. And Cannes has had an early chance to see Ken Loach's feature film, Bread and Roses, set among the office cleaners of Los Angeles. The films arrive in the week CBS decides whether or not to sign up what would be a prime-time network series called American Family about a Latino family in LA. It is made by Gregory Nava, the director whose 1983 film, El Norte, first charted the waters of the Central American immigrant crossing the border from a Latino perspective. Now those involved in the Latino film business are waiting to see whether a rather more amorphous border can be crossed. </p> <p>La Ciudad (The City), is directed by David Riker who, like Spike Lee and Martin Scorsese, is a graduate of the New York University film school. Shot by cinematographer Harlan Bosmajian, it follows the borderline lives of a group of immigrants, day labourers and sweatshop workers. Loach's film, which will open in Britain later this year, focuses on the janitors of LA who only last month were out on the streets taking part in a successful strike for better wages. The slogan, inscribed on their T-shirts, has been \"Si, se puede\" - yes, it's possible - and it's possible that a whole slice of American life that has often gone unnoticed in film is finally being recognised. </p> <p>In the early days of the silent films, Mexican-born stars like Ramon Novarro and Dolores del Rio shone brightly in Hollywood, but the talkies meant that parts for Mexican actors dried up. There were always Latino stars but most of the world was unaware that Rita Hayworth was born Margarita Cansino and started her career as a teenage dancer in Mexican clubs, or that Raquel Welch was originally Raquel Tejada, a Bolivian American. </p> <p>Now Welch is playing alongside Sonia Braga in Nava's television pilot, American Family, and she told the LA Times last week that it was nice to be \"Raquelita for a change, instead of having to play against it and be so Anglo\". </p> <p>Few of the main characters in La Ciudad or Bread and Roses have much chance of being mistaken for Anglos. Although salsa has replaced ketchup on the tables of America's diners and Latinos will make up a quarter of the nation by 2050, the change has barely been reflected on the screen. </p> <p>Nava, who grew up in the border city of San Diego and has cousins and aunts who still live in Mexico, said it had taken years to get the financing - partly from Channel 4 - to make El Norte, which subsequently received an Oscar nomination for best screenplay. </p> <p>\"It was supremely difficult to get the film made,\" said Nava. \"It was about two refugees from Guatemala and the cast had to be unknown. Today it is a little different but not that different.\" He was told then that if he had cast Brooke Shields and Robby Benson, it would have happened quicker. His 1993 film, Mi Familia (East LA when shown in Britain) starred Puerto Rican Jimmy Smits and gave Jennifer Lopez her first film role. </p> <p>Nava said that one of the reasons so few films dealing with the Latino experience had been made was that many people saw all Latinos as immigrants: \"in fact, the Latino population in Texas, for instance, is older than the white population. The non-Latino population want to simplify it and simply see it as an immigrant situation. It's much more complex than that.\" His film, Selena (1997), which also starred Lopez, told the story of a Latino crossover singer, whose father had found himself unwelcome both in white clubs because he was Mexican and in Mexican bars because he sang in English. </p> <p> Producer Barbara Martinez of El Norte films, which is behind American Family, said there had been a long struggle to get recognition for the Latino experience in film: \"the Latino community, in terms of its demographics, is very different from the African-American community because there is this continuous flow of immigrants... People are confused about where to put us.\" </p> <p>Another film on the theme of the Latino experience, Luminarias, has just opened in the US. It is a romantic comedy based on a play by Evelina Fernandez about four middle-aged, middle-class Latino women in LA and their personal lives. Director Jose Luis Valenzuela aims to show a very different type of Latino experience, in that the women are a lawyer, psychotherapist, dress designer and painter, but maintain varying degrees of allegiance to their Latino heritage. </p> <p>This manifests itself as the women socialise over margaritas and gossip about the premise that white women are basically tarts and white men are basically poorly endowed and that Latinos still feel a simmering rage about being patronised. \"He's nice but he's white,\" says one of the women of her new boyfriend. \"No one's perfect,\" says her friend in an echo of the final line in Some Like It Hot. </p> <p>\"The US is fast becoming Latino, particularly in Los Angeles, New York and Miami, and yet you don't really see that in movies the way you do in pop music with Ricky Martin and Gloria Estefan and Jennifer Lopez,\" said Peter Rainer, the Los Angeles-based film critic of New York magazine. \"It took a long time for Hollywood to wake up to the fact that there was a black audience and not just for black exploitation films like Shaft and Superfly.\"</p> <p>He said that one possibile reason why the Latino experience was rarely reflected in films was that studio executives \"don't want to see movies about the people they underpay to cut their hedges and take out their garbage. Perhaps if Gloria Estefan or Jennifer Lopez played an illegal sweatshop worker it could be financed but that doesn't seem to have happened. There has been no breakthrough hit or star to push it along.\" </p> <p>Rainer also pointed to the political context: \"Underlying much of the situation of the Latino workers is the fact that they are being exploited by the richer elements of American society to do the work that white Anglos do not want to do. </p> <p>\"Tackling their basic problems means tackling capitalism full on. While a film like Erin Brockovich can show the little person beating a corporation, the stories are essentially of one rogue company behaving badly and being brought to book by the law or the media. In film terms, it is politics lite. There is no happy ending yet to the situation of the migrant worker. For now, it's basically a ghettoised genre about ghettos.\" </p> <p>Sometimes the only people who seem to be out and about in Los Angeles in those darkest hours just before dawn are the cleaners and the film-makers both heading for work. For once they will have been heading in the same direction.</p> <p>\u0095 La Ciudad opens next Friday. Bread and Roses opens later this year.</p>",

People are confused about where to put us.\" Another film on the theme of the Latino experience, Luminarias, has just opened in the US. It is a romantic comedy based on a play by Evelina Fernandez about four middle-aged, middle-class Latino women in LA and their personal lives. Director Jose Luis Valenzuela aims to show a very different type of Latino experience, in that the women are a lawyer, psychotherapist, dress designer and painter, but maintain varying degrees of allegiance to their Latino heritage. This manifests itself as the women socialise over margaritas and gossip about the premise that white women are basically tarts and white men are basically poorly endowed and that Latinos still feel a simmering rage about being patronised. \"He's nice but he's white,\" says one of the women of her new boyfriend. \"No one's perfect,\" says her friend in an echo of the final line in Some Like It Hot. \"The US is fast becoming Latino, particularly in Los Angeles, New York and Miami, and yet you don't really see that in movies the way you do in pop music with Ricky Martin and Gloria Estefan and Jennifer Lopez,\" said Peter Rainer, the Los Angeles-based film critic of New York magazine. \"It took a long time for Hollywood to wake up to the fact that there was a black audience and not just for black exploitation films like Shaft and Superfly.\" He said that one possibile reason why the Latino experience was rarely reflected in films was that studio executives \"don't want to see movies about the people they underpay to cut their hedges and take out their garbage. Perhaps if Gloria Estefan or Jennifer Lopez played an illegal sweatshop worker it could be financed but that doesn't seem to have happened. There has been no breakthrough hit or star to push it along.\" Rainer also pointed to the political context: \"Underlying much of the situation of the Latino workers is the fact that they are being exploited by the richer elements of American society to do the work that white Anglos do not want to do. \"Tackling their basic problems means tackling capitalism full on. While a film like Erin Brockovich can show the little person beating a corporation, the stories are essentially of one rogue company behaving badly and being brought to book by the law or the media. In film terms, it is politics lite. There is no happy ending yet to the situation of the migrant worker. For now, it's basically a ghettoised genre about ghettos.\" Sometimes the only people who seem to be out and about in Los Angeles in those darkest hours just before dawn are the cleaners and the film-makers both heading for work. For once they will have been heading in the same direction. \u0095 La Ciudad opens next Friday. Bread and Roses opens later this year.",

      "body": "<p>A spectre is haunting Tinseltown. An entertainment industry that is only 30-odd years old is already outgrossing the Hollywood cinema. Videogames in this country last year made very nearly \u00a31bn - that's 60% more than total box-office receipts. The question for the cigar-chewing moguls is: what are they going to do about it?</p> <p>If you can't beat 'em, maybe you should join 'em. Already Bafta holds annual Interactive Entertainment Awards: soon the Oscars will probably follow suit. And making a film out of a successful videogame is a perfect way to guarantee a large audience.</p> <p>As the Pok\u00e9mon movie demonstrates, however, the golden rule so far is that such films are always scabby, stinking dogs. Yet people in both industries have been talking for years about \"convergence\", about some mythical future species of \"interactive movie\". George Lucas has owned a highly respected videogame studio, LucasArts, for years, and now DreamWorks is muscling in on the videogame action. Is this a sign of rapprochement between the competing monsters of mass entertainment? Could convergence ever happen? </p> <p>Well, it is certainly true that films are already stealing aesthetically from videogames. Consider, for example, the beautiful low-gravity kung-fu and joyously excessive bullet-play of The Matrix. The immediate precedent for such playful physics, it seems, is a cinematic tradition: the Hong Kong guns'n'kung-fu movie, as perfected by John Woo before he defected to Hollywood and began to make inferior, bloated copies of his earlier work. But the Hong Kong movie itself owes much to the exaggerated dynamics and superhuman violence of the beat-'em-up videogame, which first blossomed in the 80s. </p> <p>The Jackie Chan movie City Hunter explicitly acknowledges this aspect of its heritage: Chan is knocked into an arcade beat-'em-up machine, initiating a comic sequence in which, dazed by the blow, he imagines his assailant as different digitally generated videogame characters, finally winning the fight in the virtual world and so too in the real one. Japanese videogame giant Namco repaid the compliment in 1998 with Tekken 3, two of whose characters look remarkably like real-life martial-arts film stars. Namco won't admit that Forest Law is supposed to be Bruce Lee, or that Lei Wulong is Jackie Chan, but this arch denial surely has more to do with licensing problems than aesthetic decisions. </p> <p>Science fiction is another cinematic genre in which films and videogames seem to be interpollinating successfully. Sci-fi movies of course rely heavily on computerised special effects, and Nintendo's last game console was designed around a Silicon Graphics chip that was once cutting-edge Hollywood technology. Many videogames over the years have paid visual homage to the blasted, neon-lit milieu of Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, yet the production designer of that film has admitted he was himself inspired by the artwork on the side of an arcade-game cabinet. </p> <p>But last year's Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace exemplified perfectly the limits on importing videogame paradigms into film. The pod-racing sequence, a messy and confusing homage to the Ben-Hur chariot race, caused many film critics to wrinkle their noses and complain that it was just like a videogame. But the reason it is so bad is that it's not like a videogame at all. You're not playing that pod-racing sequence interactively. You just have to sit and watch. And that's boring. That sequence was merely a 10-minute commercial for the videogame that was based on it, which was far more aesthetically satisfying. </p> <p>Hollywood therefore is doomed to fail if it tries to jump the videogame bandwagon without considering why the source is successful. The recent announcement that sex-kitten Angelina Jolie is to play Lara Croft in a Tomb Raider movie spawned much salivating on game websites, but such a movie is in danger of falling prey to the same sort of problem. Croft works as a videogame character precisely because she is so defiantly abstract: a collocation of attitudinal signs - ballistic breasts, shades, hotpants, thigh holsters - that conjures (to some, at least) a Platonic ideal of sassy, self-sufficient womanhood rather than any individual. She represents, more fully than any human film star could, a blank screen on which the player can project a desire that can never in principle be reciprocated. </p> <p>One company that recognises this is Japanese videogame studios Square, which recently heroically refused a $1bn buyout offer from Microsoft. Square is pumping $100m into making a commercial movie that will be entirely computer-generated. Actors of the calibre of Donald Sutherland and James Woods have been signed up to voice the characters, but the Final Fantasy film will otherwise be entirely digital. For once, it will probably be superior to the bafflingly successful videogame series it is based on, whose only aesthetic merit lies in the linear CGI sequences the player gets to watch between bouts of head-crushingly boring gameplay. </p> <p>But really, to diagnose the likelihood of film and videogame convergence, we need to consider one thing in detail: what the camera is doing. Modern 3D videogames often operate with a variety of \"cameras\" that show the action on screen from different points of view. It may be hideously expensive to shoot a film sequence with 30 different cameras in order to intercut between the viewpoints in the editing suite, but in a videogame it's cheap. </p> <p>Many games are learning from cinematic camera techniques. The \"survival-horror\" videogame genre, comprising Resident Evil and last summer's cause celebre, Silent Hill, takes its cue from the seminal zombie flicks of George Romero, breeding a powerful sense of atmosphere with disorienting camera angles and sadistically nerve-jangling soundtracks. But the fact is that such \"cinematic\" camerawork often interferes to the detriment of the gameplay. The player often gets eaten by a zombie because she couldn't see it coming. </p> <p>In a videogame you are controlling the action: a camera swoop or crazy angle that heightens the atmosphere is also by necessity disorienting you and making it harder to choose the right course of action. That is frustrating and annoying in a videogame, but often useful in a movie. Indeed, a film director often breeds suspense by withholding information from the viewer. When Janet Leigh mounts the staircase of the Bates house in Psycho, Hitchcock chooses a tight angle on her hand moving up the banister, inducing tension through dramatic irony, as we know what awaits her at the top of the stairs. But there can be no dramatic irony in videogames, because it depends on a knowledge differential between protagonist and spectator, and in a videogame the player is both protagonist and spectator at once. </p> <p>Film pleasurably manipulates the viewer, but a game depends on being manipulable. This again explains why the pod-racing sequence in Phantom Menace is such celluloid garbage from both points of view. It is a hyperactive mess of jump-cuts, glued together in the editing room. It fails as cinematic montage. But cinematic montage in a videogame is in principle a mistake, anyway. The virtue of videogame racing action is that, unlike The Phantom Menace's pod-racing, it is always perfectly spatially coherent, as a result of the greased-lightning maths processing going on in the belly of the machine. But in order to be able to control the action, the player must have a consistent point of view: if the camera is constantly jumping around the vehicle from different angles, you'll find it impossible to control, and you'll crash and burn. </p> <p>One of the most brilliant videogames yet made, 1999's Metal Gear Solid, deals with this problem very cleverly by importing quasi-filmic montage techniques only when they do not interfere with the player's requirements of action. When the hero backs up against a wall to hide from an enemy guard, the virtual \"camera\", which normally takes a functional aerial viewpoint that allows the player to see a large section of his immediate environment, swoops in to ankle level to frame the hero and the guard walking past obliviously.</p> <p>But function takes precedence over style: true montage is still not used. An action movie would rightly cut from a close-up of the hero's face to his point of view of approaching enemies, then back to a mid-shot of the hero with his gun drawn, and so on. Yet such confrontations in the videogame must take place in long shot. </p> <p>These two paradigms of camera usage - tight montage for cinema; surveyable, functional space for the videogame - seem irreconcilable. What makes the fight sequences in Ridley Scott's Gladiator so extraordinarily, viscerally exciting - the tight angles, the fast cutting, the strobing effect of dropped frames - is exactly the opposite of what would be required in a videogame recreation of the Colosseum. </p> <p>This distinction also provides a clue as to the real reason why cinema will never be supplanted by the videogame. In a game, you are in control: you choose what to do. But we still flock to the multiplex because the lure of a great cinematic story depends on our helplessness. No amount of pantomime-style shouting of \"It's behind you!\" can alter the inexorable machinery of tragedy or farce taking place on the silver screen. And that, in the end, is why stories move us: because we can't do anything about them. To take control of the moving image in a videogame is a fascinating new aesthetic pleasure, but in other moods, we will always want to be manipulated.</p> <p>\u0095 Steven Poole's Trigger Happy: The Inner Life of Videogames is out now (Fourth Estate, \u00a312), and is available from the Guardian CultureShop (0800 3166 102) for \u00a39 plus 99p p&amp;p.</p>",

Actors of the calibre of Donald Sutherland and James Woods have been signed up to voice the characters, but the Final Fantasy film will otherwise be entirely digital. For once, it will probably be superior to the bafflingly successful videogame series it is based on, whose only aesthetic merit lies in the linear CGI sequences the player gets to watch between bouts of head-crushingly boring gameplay. But really, to diagnose the likelihood of film and videogame convergence, we need to consider one thing in detail: what the camera is doing. Modern 3D videogames often operate with a variety of \"cameras\" that show the action on screen from different points of view. It may be hideously expensive to shoot a film sequence with 30 different cameras in order to intercut between the viewpoints in the editing suite, but in a videogame it's cheap. Many games are learning from cinematic camera techniques. The \"survival-horror\" videogame genre, comprising Resident Evil and last summer's cause celebre, Silent Hill, takes its cue from the seminal zombie flicks of George Romero, breeding a powerful sense of atmosphere with disorienting camera angles and sadistically nerve-jangling soundtracks. But the fact is that such \"cinematic\" camerawork often interferes to the detriment of the gameplay. The player often gets eaten by a zombie because she couldn't see it coming. In a videogame you are controlling the action: a camera swoop or crazy angle that heightens the atmosphere is also by necessity disorienting you and making it harder to choose the right course of action. That is frustrating and annoying in a videogame, but often useful in a movie. Indeed, a film director often breeds suspense by withholding information from the viewer. When Janet Leigh mounts the staircase of the Bates house in Psycho, Hitchcock chooses a tight angle on her hand moving up the banister, inducing tension through dramatic irony, as we know what awaits her at the top of the stairs. But there can be no dramatic irony in videogames, because it depends on a knowledge differential between protagonist and spectator, and in a videogame the player is both protagonist and spectator at once. Film pleasurably manipulates the viewer, but a game depends on being manipulable. This again explains why the pod-racing sequence in Phantom Menace is such celluloid garbage from both points of view. It is a hyperactive mess of jump-cuts, glued together in the editing room. It fails as cinematic montage. But cinematic montage in a videogame is in principle a mistake, anyway. The virtue of videogame racing action is that, unlike The Phantom Menace's pod-racing, it is always perfectly spatially coherent, as a result of the greased-lightning maths processing going on in the belly of the machine. But in order to be able to control the action, the player must have a consistent point of view: if the camera is constantly jumping around the vehicle from different angles, you'll find it impossible to control, and you'll crash and burn. One of the most brilliant videogames yet made, 1999's Metal Gear Solid, deals with this problem very cleverly by importing quasi-filmic montage techniques only when they do not interfere with the player's requirements of action. When the hero backs up against a wall to hide from an enemy guard, the virtual \"camera\", which normally takes a functional aerial viewpoint that allows the player to see a large section of his immediate environment, swoops in to ankle level to frame the hero and the guard walking past obliviously. But function takes precedence over style: true montage is still not used. An action movie would rightly cut from a close-up of the hero's face to his point of view of approaching enemies, then back to a mid-shot of the hero with his gun drawn, and so on. Yet such confrontations in the videogame must take place in long shot. These two paradigms of camera usage - tight montage for cinema; surveyable, functional space for the videogame - seem irreconcilable. What makes the fight sequences in Ridley Scott's Gladiator so extraordinarily, viscerally exciting - the tight angles, the fast cutting, the strobing effect of dropped frames - is exactly the opposite of what would be required in a videogame recreation of the Colosseum. This distinction also provides a clue as to the real reason why cinema will never be supplanted by the videogame. In a game, you are in control: you choose what to do. But we still flock to the multiplex because the lure of a great cinematic story depends on our helplessness. No amount of pantomime-style shouting of \"It's behind you!\" can alter the inexorable machinery of tragedy or farce taking place on the silver screen. And that, in the end, is why stories move us: because we can't do anything about them. To take control of the moving image in a videogame is a fascinating new aesthetic pleasure, but in other moods, we will always want to be manipulated. \u0095 Steven Poole's Trigger Happy: The Inner Life of Videogames is out now (Fourth Estate, \u00a312), and is available from the Guardian CultureShop (0800 3166 102) for \u00a39 plus 99p p&amp;p.",

The computer will have to fit the human, not the other way round. I don't believe there will be any significant piece of software on the market in two years' time that cannot handle unstructured information.\" </p> <p>Mr Lynch was speaking after unveiling a pre-tax profit of $440,000 (\u00a3294,000) for the three months to March 31, compared with a $885,000 loss in the previous period. Revenues rose from $7.2m to $11.7m and gross margins increased to 93%. </p> <p>Mr Lynch added: \"It's good to be on the right side of profit - we've actually come in on a basis which is considerably ahead of what people were expecting. It all comes down to what the business does, and that is to make money.\" </p> <p>He said growth had been boosted by partnership agreements with customers including General Motors, Eli Lily and the Nationwide Building Society. The US now accounts for 56% of revenues and the company is eyeing the Asia-Pacific and Latin American markets. \"We want to get our technology into every little bit of software and need to have enough cash to be sure to get there,\" Mr Lynch said. Autonomy has $130m in cash at its disposal following its Nasdaq listing in March. </p> <p>Mr Lynch claims Autonomy's technology, which is based on mathematical probability theory, is the most advanced in the world and that it is a fundamental part of the \"plumbing\" of the internet. </p> <p>Investors have backed him and shares in Autonomy, which are listed on Easdaq, have outperformed that market by 157% so far this year.

      "bodyText": "Autonomy, the Cambridge-based intelligent software company, is to turn its attention to voice recognition after reporting a pre-tax profit for the first time. Chief executive Mike Lynch said Autonomy has bought a majority stake in SoftSound and will marry Autonomy's technology, which attempts to make contextual sense of text rather than simply identifying keywords, with SoftSound's speech technology to enable voice and speech records to be managed automatically. Mr Lynch did not disclose the price paid for SoftSound, which is also based in Cambridge. \"The amount of information moving around the average big company is doubling every three months and 80% of it is unstructured,\" he said. \"The prospect of handling that information manually, be it voice mails, telephone inquiries or emails, is becoming unlikely and they will have to automate it. \"The currency of human interaction is unstructured information. The computer will have to fit the human, not the other way round. I don't believe there will be any significant piece of software on the market in two years' time that cannot handle unstructured information.\" Mr Lynch was speaking after unveiling a pre-tax profit of $440,000 (\u00a3294,000) for the three months to March 31, compared with a $885,000 loss in the previous period. Revenues rose from $7.2m to $11.7m and gross margins increased to 93%. Mr Lynch added: \"It's good to be on the right side of profit - we've actually come in on a basis which is considerably ahead of what people were expecting. It all comes down to what the business does, and that is to make money.\" He said growth had been boosted by partnership agreements with customers including General Motors, Eli Lily and the Nationwide Building Society. The US now accounts for 56% of revenues and the company is eyeing the Asia-Pacific and Latin American markets. \"We want to get our technology into every little bit of software and need to have enough cash to be sure to get there,\" Mr Lynch said. Autonomy has $130m in cash at its disposal following its Nasdaq listing in March. Mr Lynch claims Autonomy's technology, which is based on mathematical probability theory, is the most advanced in the world and that it is a fundamental part of the \"plumbing\" of the internet. Investors have backed him and shares in Autonomy, which are listed on Easdaq, have outperformed that market by 157% so far this year. Last night the shares closed down $1.13 at $132.",

What he will be left with is the task of mastering one of the most fascinating, if often frustrating, jobs in British journalism. I am confident his thoughts will not be dominated by any struggle of the soul about being politically fair. That will almost handle itself, while he gets on with tougher journalistic problems. </p> <p>I was the BBC's political editor from 1981 until 1992. I came from 20 years on the Guardian as labour correspondent, news editor and deputy editor, and from six years on the Observer as deputy editor. So my own political views were scarcely a state secret. But I had enjoyed decent relationships with everyone from Harold Wilson and Jim Callaghan to Ted Heath, Willie Whitelaw and Margaret Thatcher, and they knew I believed in fair dealing. </p> <p>No political journalist comes without baggage. It would be impossible even to decide which subjects win their place in the time limits of broadcast news, impossible to make them comprehensible to a mass audience, without having an obsessive interest and views. The question is what else you do with your views. In 1981, the BBC and ITN had a duopoly of broadcast news. Fair dealing among the parties seemed a moral imperative. I made a promise - to myself, not to anybody else - to do my best to provide it. </p> <p>The BBC itself is obsessive about its reputation for impartiality. On joining, I had not lost my taste for political analysis, at greater length than broadcast news allows, so I wrote a column for the Listener and, after its closure, for the New Statesman. During Conservative attacks on the Marr appointment, I was amused to recall that the BBC was nervous when I proposed to write for the New Statesman. But I pointed out that numerous colleagues were contributing to the Spectator, not a wholly even-handed journal. The matter was dropped. </p> <p>Andrew Marr's short article in the Observer last Sunday avoided stoking the controversy over his appointment. In a more relaxed age, I was less circumspect. For me, this was farewell to 36 years in newspapers, 25 of them in Fleet Street, and I felt the pain. Nor did the move to broadcasting reflect any disillusionment with print. Tiny Rowland had just taken over the Observer, and I played a leading part in resisting him at the Monopolies Commission. We lost, and Mr Rowland and I had an abrasive exchange at the Department of Trade in the middle of the night. The next morning, the BBC rang about its political editorship. We modern nonconformists are ambiguous about calvinist predestination but, in this case, I decided to make the jump. </p> <p>I don't suppose nuns contemplating the veil have a last fling, but my farewell article did \"cast one longing, lingering look behind\". It was an unashamed exercising of favourite hobby-horses - poverty, inequality, the value of trade unions, incomes policy, peace and justice in Northern Ireland - all as I saw them. Very different from what both large political parties, or indeed the Guardian, now think, but there you go. </p> <p>In passing, the article mentioned that proportional representation for Westminster elections might not be God's gift to democracy. A Liberal friend told me that this article was pinned up in their whips' office, to remind them what a desperado they were dealing with. </p> <p> There were comparatively few early strains with politicians. A Panorama programme during the Falklands war caused half a dozen angry Conservative back-benchers to surround me in the members' lobby after the 10 o'clock division. I had not seen Panorama, and was concentrating on a news story about something different, so I advised them to contact the director-general with their complaint. But they were persistent to the point of rudeness, so I said huffily that I had not been introduced to several of them and would bid them good evening. Some of them kindly telephoned me to apologise. </p> <p>The best contribution I could make at the BBC was to bring more of the enterprise of newspaper political reporting into broadcasting. I bumped my nose against some internal traditions. The corporation has traces of the civil service about it, and not just over impartiality. When I was required to sign the Official Secrets Act, I pointed out to a bemused executive that they had hired me to persuade cabinet ministers to shade their privy councillor's oath. Otherwise our coverage would be merely faithful recording of what Bernard Ingham was briefed to tell us. </p> <p>I did spend more time than I could afford educating others in the BBC about the facts of journalistic life at Westminster. I lost one good scoop - the beginning of the row between Margaret Thatcher and Nigel Lawson over monetary policy, which eventually brought them both down - because I could not convince a programme editor it was important and comprehensible in a two-minute slot. If I had known how to use graphics better, the story would have worked, but it was still galling to be asked, by a different editor four days later, to comment on air about \"this very interesting Sunday Times exclusive\". </p> <p>My life at the BBC was a process of reciprocal re-education. I learned a lot from colleagues, and they tolerated bravely what the Guardian historian called my tendency to make an opponent in argument \"feel personally to blame for the heat-death of the universe\". But there was undoubtedly far more a strain through internal debate than any strains with the political parties. </p> <p>My 11 years at Westminster for the BBC were entirely during Conservative governments. This, far more than my personal opinions, dictated the agenda. Younger Labour MPs, who did not remember me as labour correspondent of the Guardian, may well have thought it was political bias which made me spend hours in the Lobby talking mostly to Tories. What distinguishes journalists from politicians is that they want to be where the story is. The story in my period was primarily in the internal Conservative debate over Thatcherism. It will be different for Andrew Marr. </p> <p>This is a job where you shoot arrows in the air without knowing much about their destination. Seven years into retirement, I am still surprised how many people in the street - those who don't think I used to forecast the weather - say kind things about my political reporting on television.

One of these is the annual cultivation of an unnamed but highly prolific runner bean from which huge crops result in his Uley garden. I have prevailed upon Dodger to let me have a tray of his seedling beans for a couple of seasons now and last year restricted myself to growing them on in our courtyard garden here. </p> <p>This season, however, has given me the opportunity to spread the fame of the Dodger Norris Eurobean in an international context. On our last visit to Brittany earlier this month I took half the tray with me and planted them, with suitable cane support, in some rich leaf mould soil close to some blackcurrant bushes I had already started. Exhaustive international comparative testing will be the pre-occupation this summer as I note the relative development of these beans under the different conditions of rural Gloucestershire and coastal Finistere. </p> <p>On my limited observation the French, although enthused about haricot verts as a bean do not cultivate the runner bean of our island tradition so my cane support frame with, I hope, rapidly ascending beans, may lead to enquiries from neighbouring gardeners green with envy at this startling new crop. Providing my French is up to it, I will mutter confusing explanations of secret international plant trials being undertaken here in rural Brittany before their very eyes. And if I can follow the explanation up with a complimentary handful of locally grown runner beans then so much the better for international European understanding. Let's hope they do not suspect genetic modification trials and bring motley vagrants to wreck the plot. </p> <p>The elderly neighbour up the hill who passes by with his handsome chow on a lead every morning, was with de Gaulle's Free French forces in London during the war, and may have familiarity with the runner bean from that period of exposure to English ways. If so, then Dodger's beans will not be a local mystery at all. Let's hope they prove to be the dependable success they do in the home context.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Tetbury My occasional golf partner, Dodger Norris, onetime famed Severn elver fisherman and local snooker champion, has other strings to his bow. One of these is the annual cultivation of an unnamed but highly prolific runner bean from which huge crops result in his Uley garden. I have prevailed upon Dodger to let me have a tray of his seedling beans for a couple of seasons now and last year restricted myself to growing them on in our courtyard garden here. This season, however, has given me the opportunity to spread the fame of the Dodger Norris Eurobean in an international context. On our last visit to Brittany earlier this month I took half the tray with me and planted them, with suitable cane support, in some rich leaf mould soil close to some blackcurrant bushes I had already started. Exhaustive international comparative testing will be the pre-occupation this summer as I note the relative development of these beans under the different conditions of rural Gloucestershire and coastal Finistere. On my limited observation the French, although enthused about haricot verts as a bean do not cultivate the runner bean of our island tradition so my cane support frame with, I hope, rapidly ascending beans, may lead to enquiries from neighbouring gardeners green with envy at this startling new crop. Providing my French is up to it, I will mutter confusing explanations of secret international plant trials being undertaken here in rural Brittany before their very eyes. And if I can follow the explanation up with a complimentary handful of locally grown runner beans then so much the better for international European understanding. Let's hope they do not suspect genetic modification trials and bring motley vagrants to wreck the plot. The elderly neighbour up the hill who passes by with his handsome chow on a lead every morning, was with de Gaulle's Free French forces in London during the war, and may have familiarity with the runner bean from that period of exposure to English ways. If so, then Dodger's beans will not be a local mystery at all. Let's hope they prove to be the dependable success they do in the home context.",

      "bodyText": "Filmgroup yesterday said it intends to press ahead with a stock market flotation although, like its video-on-demand rival Yes Television, it will be at a reduced valuation. The business will be capitalised at around \u00a3177m against original estimates of up to \u00a3300m. Fimgroup chief executive Simon Franks said the scaled down offer price, a range of 175p-230p a share, took account of the volatility of financial markets. \"I'd much rather see us priced conservatively. In a young business, team spirit is essential and if you push for cash in an unstable market you will see volatility which does not boost morale.\" The company is offering 40m new shares, accounting for around 31% of the enlarged share capital and raising \u00a381m. Mr Franks, 28, owns around 20.5% of the company while Demon Internet founder Cliff Stanford has 40.9%. Filmgroup combines a film distribution business with a video-on-demand operation which will deliver content over broadband internet networks. The key opportunity arrives when British Telelcom converts its network with ADSL technology. Yes TV, which was also rocked by a spate of bad publicity in the run-up to its flotation, will be valued at around \u00a3500m.",

      "bodyText": "British military officials intend to press ahead with the war against Sierra Leone's rebel Revolutionary United Front despite the capture of its leader, Foday Sankoh. As RAF Harriers based on the aircraft carrier, HMS Illustrious, flew over the west African country in what were described as reconnaissance missions, officials said 600 Royal Marines stationed offshore on the helicopter carrier, HMS Ocean, were preparing an amphibious landing. They are expected to take over from the paratroopers deployed in and around Freetown. British sources said they could remain beyond mid-June, the time limit given by ministers for the withdrawal of all British forces from Sierra Leone. The UN yesterday called for a ceasefire in light of Mr Sankoh's arrest. \"We would hope that both parties would stop where they are and cease fighting,\" said spokesman David Wimhurst. An end to the fighting seems most unlikely. Mr Sankoh's capture bolstered the confidence of the British-led pro-government forces which are pressing east from Freetown while plans are put in place to seize the diamond fields in the south and east of the country that have long funded the RUF's war. However, the rebel leader's arrest does raise the possibility of a negotiated settlement if Mr Sankoh can be persuaded to order his men to give up the fight and surrender their weapons, and if they obey the command. With Nigeria and other west African states planning to dispatch an additional 3,000 troops to the country, the rebels were reported to be retreating around the Port Loco area, about 35 miles from the international airport, after Wednesday's clash with British troops. It is now believed more than 100 RUF fighters were involved in the attack on the post of 29 members of the parachute regiment and 20 Nigerian troops at Lungi Loi. It is increasingly clear that while the official line is that the paratroopers were merely defending themselves, the British had intelligence warning that the RUF column was coming and it effectively walked into a trap. Though the army says the bodies of four rebels have been recovered, the real toll may be much higher, given that the RUF column came under persistent ground and air attack. The additional west African troops will be a valuable addition to the pro-government forces. The Nigerians have experience and commitment in fighting the RUF and it seems likely they will not be directly integrated into the UN force. This would give the Nigerians the freedom to go on the offensive against the rebels, which is technically beyond the UN peacekeepers' mandate. But the introduction of a sixth independent force alongside the UN, British, Sierra Leone army, Kamajor militia and former military ruler Johnny Paul Karoma's troops will raise its own problems. The Nigerians argue that with 3,000 soldiers serving with the UN in Sierra Leone and a similar number on their way, they should have overall command of the campaign against the rebels. But for now that remains in the hands of the British commander, Brigadier David Richards. Mr Sankoh's whereabouts are once again a mystery. He was moved from Freetown's international airport, which is under guard by the parachute regiment, to an undisclosed location on Wednesday night. The UN said the rebels have released a further 80 peacekeepers held hostage by the RUF, but 270 others remain in captivity. The New York-based Human Rights Watch expressed grave concern about credible reports that government-allied forces in Sierra Leone were torturing and executing suspected RUF members. It urged the authorities of Sierra Leone and the international community to take immediate steps to prevent a descent into \"mob justice\".",

At the centre of the unrest, near the City Inn hotel in Ramallah, Palestinian policemen fighting shoulder to shoulder with stone-throwing protesters fired live rounds, setting off a gunbattle which lasted for several hours.

More than 30 other UP supporters were badly beaten in Mudzi. One more supporter of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) was killed yesterday, bringing to 23 the total of opposition supporters who have been killed by Mr Mugabe's supporters. Throughout the country, Mugabe supporters beat, tortured and murdered opposition supporters. Teachers, nurses and farmers have fled their rural homes hoping to find safety in the cities. But Mr Mugabe's party has taken its violent campaign to Harare. Takundwa Chapunza was beaten to death, reportedly in the surgery owned by Chenjerai Hunzvi, leader of the militant war veterans who support Mr Mugabe. The surgery, in Budiriro township, is used as an interrogation centre and more than 200 people have been tortured and beaten there in the past two weeks. Yesterday war veterans from the surgery went door to door beating township residents suspected of supporting the MDC. Another group of war veterans in the eastern mountain town of Chimanimani dragged teachers from their classrooms, accused them of supporting the MDC, and stripped and beat them in front of their students. They also invaded the Border Timbers factory in Chimanimani, beat up several employees and threatened the management. The mill, Zimbabwe's biggest, with 3,500 employees, closed yesterday because of the violence. In the central city of Kwekwe Mugabe supporters tried to kill the MDC candidate for parliament, Blessing Chibundo, and burned his house down.

They were ravenous after bashing the phones to council delegates, and retired to discuss their night's work.</p> <p>Philip Weir, 28, chairman of the Young Unionists, had taken a week's holiday, while Simon Hamilton, 23, chairman of Ulster Unionists at Queen's University, was passing on revision for forthcoming law exams. All were spending every night this week campaigning, stealing a march on pro-agreement colleagues.</p> <p>Dr Weir said: \"It is one key difference. We have the commitment. Many of the party leadership's canvassers would be employees. We tend to put in that extra phone call. It could prove crucial.\"</p> <p>Operational HQ is a warehouse in east Belfast, while other canvassing centres are at the offices of anti-agreement MPs Jeffrey Donaldson and Martin Smyth. The Orange Order also helps to fund their campaign.</p> <p>They have worked unchallenged for a week, focusing particularly on the middle third of the 860-strong ruling council and on new delegates who took their places in March. They believe the vote against a return to the executive with Sinn Fein on the basis of the IRA offer is running about 60 to 40 in their favour.</p> <p>That was the message which party officers were delivering to David Trimble yesterday. To give himself just one full day's campaigning was too little, particularly as he has spent almost the last two weeks publicly highlighting the flaws in the deal.</p> <p>Those against restored devolution are largely those who opposed the agreement and who voted for Mr Smyth, South Belfast MP, in the leadership election two months ago. But they say delegates previously unquestioningly loyal to Mr Trimble are switching.</p> <p>With Mr Trimble winning by a 57 to 43 majority against Mr Smyth in March, they will win if they can persuade 60 people to switch. They have built up a database on every delegate, and have earmarked specific party figures to speak to doubters after initial calls.</p> <p>Mr Hamilton, who alone made 25 calls on Wednesday evening, said: \"Many people want to talk at length about the issues. They feel a little unloved by the other side. Even in areas which have strongly been behind the leadership, we are making heartening inroads.\"</p> <p>The meeting of the party council, which will now take place a week on Saturday, is the fourth in seven months.

      "bodyText": "Early yesterday morning, half a dozen Ulster Unionists opposed to a quick return to government stopped off at Pithika Kebab House in south Belfast. They were ravenous after bashing the phones to council delegates, and retired to discuss their night's work. Philip Weir, 28, chairman of the Young Unionists, had taken a week's holiday, while Simon Hamilton, 23, chairman of Ulster Unionists at Queen's University, was passing on revision for forthcoming law exams. All were spending every night this week campaigning, stealing a march on pro-agreement colleagues. Dr Weir said: \"It is one key difference. We have the commitment. Many of the party leadership's canvassers would be employees. We tend to put in that extra phone call. It could prove crucial.\" Operational HQ is a warehouse in east Belfast, while other canvassing centres are at the offices of anti-agreement MPs Jeffrey Donaldson and Martin Smyth. The Orange Order also helps to fund their campaign. They have worked unchallenged for a week, focusing particularly on the middle third of the 860-strong ruling council and on new delegates who took their places in March. They believe the vote against a return to the executive with Sinn Fein on the basis of the IRA offer is running about 60 to 40 in their favour. That was the message which party officers were delivering to David Trimble yesterday. To give himself just one full day's campaigning was too little, particularly as he has spent almost the last two weeks publicly highlighting the flaws in the deal. Those against restored devolution are largely those who opposed the agreement and who voted for Mr Smyth, South Belfast MP, in the leadership election two months ago. But they say delegates previously unquestioningly loyal to Mr Trimble are switching. With Mr Trimble winning by a 57 to 43 majority against Mr Smyth in March, they will win if they can persuade 60 people to switch. They have built up a database on every delegate, and have earmarked specific party figures to speak to doubters after initial calls. Mr Hamilton, who alone made 25 calls on Wednesday evening, said: \"Many people want to talk at length about the issues. They feel a little unloved by the other side. Even in areas which have strongly been behind the leadership, we are making heartening inroads.\" The meeting of the party council, which will now take place a week on Saturday, is the fourth in seven months. The anti-agreement camp has refined its tactics and adopted a more coherent structure. Those who call delegates for the first time are aided with a crib sheet. They admit it is rather like cold calling. Dan Ross, 24, an insurance broker, said: \"The IRA's offer is the usual rhetoric and vague in the extreme. It makes no sense to go back into government without decommissioning when it was because there had been none that the institutions were suspended in February.\" Peter Weir, the Ulster Unionist assembly member who last year lost the party whip because of his vocal opposition to the agreement, joined the others later. He is now the Ulster Unionist parliamentary candidate in North Down, much to Mr Trimble's fury. He was helping them draw up their latest letter. As well as the IRA issue, they are emphasising devolution will signal the return of the former IRA chief of staff Martin McGuinness as education minister.",

The National Criminal Intelligence Service yesterday warned that hooliganism was once again on the increase, and predicted that English fans were \"almost guaranteed\" to be in the thick of any trouble in Holland and Belgium. In the worst outbreak of widespread football-related violence since England supporters went on the rampage during the 1998 World Cup, 19 people were injured and more than 60 arrested in clashes between Arsenal and Galatasaray. Last night there were reports of fresh fighting between the supporters at Copenhagen airport. Bottles were thrown and fights broke out between the rival factions as fans waited to board planes home, a Danish police spokesman said. Earlier, 15 Britons arrested during the troubles were released without being charged. Danish police said their priority was to get the fans out of the country as quickly as possible.

The British authorities are hoping that police in Belgium and Holland, who have been co-ordinating closely with NCIS in the run up to the tournament, will have learned from Wednesday night. Despite warnings that Arsenal hooligans were planning to travel to the match, Danish police adopted a \"softly softly\" approach to security.

Once again the old defence that only a minority took part has been raised by police and football officials. Indeed, not all fans were fighting and there were moments of sportsmanship and goodwill, with rival fans swapping scarves and shaking hands. Trouble first flared early on Wednesday as an army of Galatasaray fans began arriving in the city, outnumbering their Arsenal rivals by almost five to one. The Turkish fans, singing songs and waving flags, took control of City Hall Square. Most of the Arsenal fans were in four nearby pubs and it quickly became obvious that some among the Turkish contingent were itching for a fight. A group of Galatasaray fans marched out of the square towards the Bar Absalon, where Arsenal fans were drinking, and once outside, started singing songs and baiting their opponents.

It was a vicious, brutal battle that soon spilled on to surrounding streets as rival mobs charged at each other and some among both groups could be seen wielding knives and clubs. Not even the firing of tear gas above the heads of the crowd managed to quell them. The screams of innocent people caught up in the trouble could be heard above the roars.

Mr Mbeki, who is on a two-day visit to Britain, diplomatically backed him up.</p> <p>But the United Nations development programme has been called in to investigate the issues at the heart of the dispute between Britain and Zimbabwe: the 1998 British-Zimbabwe agreement on land compensation.</p> <p>A spokesman for the UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, said he hoped the involvement of the UNDP would \" help defuse the current confrontation and pave the way for a just and equitable resolution of the problem\".</p> <p>Mr Annan had asked the UNDP to \"explore the possibility of helping facilitate a renewed land reform programme in Zimbabwe\".</p> <p>His spokesman added: \"The inequitable land ownership patterns have long been a source of political and economic tension in the country.\"</p> <p>Most of the fertile land was in the hands of a small number of farmers, many of them white, while the bulk of the rural population was crowded on to small areas of communal land.</p> <p>The UN aimed for a \"mutually acceptable plan of action\" that would involve:</p> <p>\u0095 more equitable redistribution of land;</p> <p>\u0095 an adequately funded land purchase programme that would provide compensation at fair market prices;</p> <p>\u0095 a transparent process;</p> <p>\u0095 a commitment to ensuring that the poorest people benefit from the international assistance.</p> <p>Mr Mbeki has been holding talks with both Mr Annan and the Zimbabwean president, Robert Mugabe.</p> <p>Mr Blair paid tribute to Mr Mbeki: \"We appreciate Mr Mbeki's quiet diplomacy in this matter. South Africa has a key role to play in using its influence to restore stability to the region.\"</p> <p>Mr Mbeki said: \"All violence must come to an end. We want a land reform that is beneficial to all Zimbabweans - without conflict or confrontation.\"</p> <p>Talks between the foreign secretary, Robin Cook, and a delegation of ministers from Zimbabwe ended in failure last month. Mr Cook insisted that Zimbabwe meet various conditions regarded as essential for any land reform programme, in particular respect for law and assurances that it would help the rural poor rather than Mr Mugabe's cronies. In return Britain would provide a \u00a336m aid programme.</p> <p>The crisis stems directly from illegal seizures of land held by white farmers. The Zimbabwe delegation last month accused Britain of having a colonial attitude and demanded the \u00a336m without conditions. It accused Britain of reneging on the 1998 settlement and insisted Britain must compensate white farmers for land lost in Zimbabwe.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The United Nations yesterday announced it is to intervene to try to break the deadlock between Britain and Zimbabwe in the land dispute. The UN move was negotiated behind the scenes during the past few days by the South African president, Thabo Mbeki, who was in London yesterday for talks with Tony Blair. Mr Blair, anxious to avoid the embarrassment of having the UN adjudicate, denied at a Downing Street press conference that the UN involvement amounted to mediation. Mr Mbeki, who is on a two-day visit to Britain, diplomatically backed him up. But the United Nations development programme has been called in to investigate the issues at the heart of the dispute between Britain and Zimbabwe: the 1998 British-Zimbabwe agreement on land compensation. A spokesman for the UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, said he hoped the involvement of the UNDP would \" help defuse the current confrontation and pave the way for a just and equitable resolution of the problem\". Mr Annan had asked the UNDP to \"explore the possibility of helping facilitate a renewed land reform programme in Zimbabwe\". His spokesman added: \"The inequitable land ownership patterns have long been a source of political and economic tension in the country.\" Most of the fertile land was in the hands of a small number of farmers, many of them white, while the bulk of the rural population was crowded on to small areas of communal land. The UN aimed for a \"mutually acceptable plan of action\" that would involve: \u0095 more equitable redistribution of land; \u0095 an adequately funded land purchase programme that would provide compensation at fair market prices; \u0095 a transparent process; \u0095 a commitment to ensuring that the poorest people benefit from the international assistance. Mr Mbeki has been holding talks with both Mr Annan and the Zimbabwean president, Robert Mugabe. Mr Blair paid tribute to Mr Mbeki: \"We appreciate Mr Mbeki's quiet diplomacy in this matter. South Africa has a key role to play in using its influence to restore stability to the region.\" Mr Mbeki said: \"All violence must come to an end. We want a land reform that is beneficial to all Zimbabweans - without conflict or confrontation.\" Talks between the foreign secretary, Robin Cook, and a delegation of ministers from Zimbabwe ended in failure last month. Mr Cook insisted that Zimbabwe meet various conditions regarded as essential for any land reform programme, in particular respect for law and assurances that it would help the rural poor rather than Mr Mugabe's cronies. In return Britain would provide a \u00a336m aid programme. The crisis stems directly from illegal seizures of land held by white farmers. The Zimbabwe delegation last month accused Britain of having a colonial attitude and demanded the \u00a336m without conditions. It accused Britain of reneging on the 1998 settlement and insisted Britain must compensate white farmers for land lost in Zimbabwe.",

Yesterday he welcomed the results of the study, which he said \"reinforce what the veterans themselves have been saying for a number of years\".</p> <p>The symptoms of Gulf war syndrome are many and resemble those of chronic fatigue syndrome. For the purposes of the study, scientists from King's College, London, concentrated on veterans who reported fatigue, muscle pains and problems with concentration and memory.</p> <p>The study, published in the British Medical Journal, found that veterans with multi-symptom illness were up to five times more likely to have been given a cocktail of five or more vaccinations - including anthrax, plague and pertussis (whooping cough) to activate the immune system against the anthrax - after they had been deployed rather than before they were sent out.</p> <p>Matthew Hotopf and colleagues from the Gulf war illnesses unit at King's suggest that the stresses of being in the Gulf, which included a change of climate, living conditions, diet, sleeping patterns and physical activity as well as fears for their lives and separation from their families, may have acted with the vaccinations to cause illness.</p> <p>\"It may be that multiple vaccines cause an increased risk of side effects and these reactions - which are usually self-limiting - gain new salience in settings of stress, such as being deployed to the Gulf,\" says the paper.</p> <p>The researchers used data from a health survey completed by 3,284 veterans of the Gulf war, but focused on the 923 (28%) who still had their vaccination records from the time.</p> <p>The researchers could not find any association between vaccines and either the use of pesticides or what they call \"traditional military stressors\" - such as coming under fire or witnessing death and injury.</p> <p>\"The lack of an association with military stressors does not necessarily indicate that there is no interaction between stress and vaccines,\" they say.</p> <p>\"Such military stressors may be less important for trained service personnel than the general stress associated with deployment.\"</p> <p>Dr Hotopf said yesterday: \"We obviously don't claim that this is the end of the story - that we have found a cause of Gulf war illness. We have found one piece in a complicated jigsaw. There are a lot of other health hazards veterans were exposed to.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "The multiple vaccinations given to protect soldiers from biological weapons during the Gulf war combined with the stress of deployment may be partly responsible for the multiple illnesses veterans have suffered, according to new research. Some 5,000 veterans are still suffering from Gulf war syndrome nearly 10 years on, according to John Nichol, president of the Gulf veterans branch of the Royal British Legion, and 500 have died from a variety of causes following ill health brought on, he believes, by their Gulf service. Yesterday he welcomed the results of the study, which he said \"reinforce what the veterans themselves have been saying for a number of years\". The symptoms of Gulf war syndrome are many and resemble those of chronic fatigue syndrome. For the purposes of the study, scientists from King's College, London, concentrated on veterans who reported fatigue, muscle pains and problems with concentration and memory. The study, published in the British Medical Journal, found that veterans with multi-symptom illness were up to five times more likely to have been given a cocktail of five or more vaccinations - including anthrax, plague and pertussis (whooping cough) to activate the immune system against the anthrax - after they had been deployed rather than before they were sent out. Matthew Hotopf and colleagues from the Gulf war illnesses unit at King's suggest that the stresses of being in the Gulf, which included a change of climate, living conditions, diet, sleeping patterns and physical activity as well as fears for their lives and separation from their families, may have acted with the vaccinations to cause illness. \"It may be that multiple vaccines cause an increased risk of side effects and these reactions - which are usually self-limiting - gain new salience in settings of stress, such as being deployed to the Gulf,\" says the paper. The researchers used data from a health survey completed by 3,284 veterans of the Gulf war, but focused on the 923 (28%) who still had their vaccination records from the time. The researchers could not find any association between vaccines and either the use of pesticides or what they call \"traditional military stressors\" - such as coming under fire or witnessing death and injury. \"The lack of an association with military stressors does not necessarily indicate that there is no interaction between stress and vaccines,\" they say. \"Such military stressors may be less important for trained service personnel than the general stress associated with deployment.\" Dr Hotopf said yesterday: \"We obviously don't claim that this is the end of the story - that we have found a cause of Gulf war illness. We have found one piece in a complicated jigsaw. There are a lot of other health hazards veterans were exposed to.\"",

      "bodyText": "Plans to introduce binding anti-racism laws across the European Union were condemned last night by the Conservatives who claimed that \"red tape\" would only damage job prospects for members of ethnic minorities. As MEPs in Strasbourg voted by 179 to 48 to back a controversial new directive, Francis Maude, the shadow foreign secretary, warned that the measures could do more harm than good. But the Tories - attacking \"gesture politics\" by the left - in turn came under furious fire for seeking to derail efforts to tackle racism. Under the new laws racial harassment and victimisation would be outlawed while sweeping protection against race discrimination in education, employment and in access to grants and scholarships, social protection and social security would be introduced. Some of the measures, being pushed in response to fears about the rise of rightwing extremism across the continent, already exist in principle in national laws. But the directive will offer more safeguards and make it easier to bring legal action. \"We fully support any measures that will stamp on race hatred and racial abuse,\" Mr Maude said in a statement. He added: \"Jobs must be won on merit and not race, but we have doubts as to whether this well meaning but muddle-headed directive will be effective. \"As it stands, the directive threatens to damage the job prospects of ethnic minorities. It sends the message that employers who hire ethnic minorities will be faced with more red tape burdens.\" Supporters have praised the measures as the most far reaching moves since Britain's 1976 Race Relations Act. The directive will need the backing of EU ministers who are expected to approve it next month. Its terms include the reintroduction of an anti-racist measure called \"contract compliance\" which was outlawed in Britain under the last Conservative government. It would once more oblige companies to prove that they comply with anti-discrimination law before awarding a contract. Another controversial feature is the reversal of the burden of proof in civil race discrimination cases. This would mean the onus would be on the accused to prove their innocence \"once the complainant has clearly established facts from which a court or tribunal can presume discrimination.\" British Tory MEPs said they were opposing the measure on the grounds that the reverse had \"formed one of the foundations of UK law for centuries\".",

      "bodyText": "A top American scientist accused Pentagon officials and defence contractors yesterday of deliberately trying to hoax the US government and the public about the effectiveness of America's planned national missile defence (NMD) system. An analysis of the Pentagon's test-flight data claims to show that the US's planned anti-missile interceptor system is incapable of distinguishing between a missile and a decoy, a former defence department adviser said. Assertions that the US would be able to protect its citizens against incoming enemy missiles by taking them out with interceptors cannot be sustained on the basis of the data from the current US test programme, Professor Theodore Postol of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology says. If Mr Postol is correct, President Clinton's decision later this summer about whether to go ahead with the $60bn (\u00a340bn) NMD project will be taken on unreliable scientific evidence, and the anti-missile system which the US would install might not work. The potentially devastating charges against NMD come as Nato foreign ministers prepare to debate the US plan at a summit in Italy next week. Currently, no Nato member state other than the US favours the system. Mr Postol, who was scientific adviser to the Pentagon's chief of naval operations under President Ronald Reagan from 1982 to 1984, says that the data from the first of four NMD system tests prove that the anti-missile interceptor \"will be defeated by the simplest of balloon decoys\". In that test, which took place in June 1997 and involved a \"fly-by\" by an interceptor, the interceptor was unable to differentiate between warheads and balloon decoys. The Pentagon's Ballistic Missile Defence Organisation (BMDO) and its contractors subsequently \"attempted to hide this fact\" by tampering with the data and by changing subsequent tests to obscure \"programme-stopping facts\", Mr Postol charged in a letter sent to the White House on May 11. Later tests, including the scheduled June 26 test on the basis of which Mr Clinton is due to make his deployment decision, have consisted only of a warhead and a single, intensely illuminated balloon decoy. This has enabled the interceptor to make a simple differentiation between the two objects and has allowed the Pentagon to claim that its test programme has been more successful than it really has been, Mr Postol says. \"It is an elaborate hoax. It appears to be a piece of science when in fact it is just mumbo-jumbo,\" Mr Postol said yesterday \"It is a pretty coordinated fraud between the BMDO and its contractors. The system is not in any way workable. If an adversary deployed a bunch of aluminium balloons, the interceptor would not be able to tell which was the missile.\" The letter called for additional analysis of the NMD system by independent scientists. A White House spokesman said that it was premature to create an outside review of the NMD test programme. A spokesman for the BMDO said that a detailed written response to Mr Postol's charges was being prepared. President Clinton has said that the decision to deploy NMD - which is bitterly opposed by almost every government in the world, including Russia, China and, less vocally, the United Kingdom - will depend upon four factors: whether it works, what it will cost, whether it is judged necessary, and its impact upon international arms control. While it would be difficult for Mr Clinton to deploy the NMD system if it was shown not to work, the political imperatives of a US election year may compel him to do so.",

      "bodyText": "Channel 4, long a fierce opponent of its own privatisation, yesterday admitted that it may seek stock market flotations for some of its commercial operations, such as the pay television business FilmFour. The organisation opened the door to raising funds in the City as it detailed plans to invest up to \u00a3100m in the launch of E4, its digital entertainment channel, later this year. The broadcaster is committing an increasing amount of cash to commercial interests and also intends to set up a dedicated horse racing channel and a clutch of online services, including one aimed at the gay community. FilmFour has 300,000 subscribers but lost \u00a320m last year and is not targeted to break even until 2003. Michael Jackson, Channel 4 chief executive, said there were no immediate plans to float any of the commercial enterprises, but conceded that the organisation was \"open to the possibility\".

He said from his hotel in Rimini that the police claimed he was \"dealing with Russian intelligence\".

Mr Kraemer said concerns about public health and traffic congestion and pollution caused by the lorries required to deliver hundreds of thousands of tons of waste to each incinerator had turned the public against them. \"Once they are built we are talking about creating waste streams for the next 25 years to keep the incinerators going,\" he said. His warning follows revelations from the United States that Britain's new generation of incinerators could pose a cancer threat to local residents. Mr Kraemer's comments will put more pressure on Michael Meacher, the environment minister, to justify plans to build incinerators across the country. He is already under pressure from the Downing Street policy unit and the Cabinet Office to modify a policy that could cost Labour votes in its heartland seats and among many of the people who switched to Labour in the south-east of England. Mr Meacher yesterday ordered the early publication of the government's revised waste strategy after a last minute tussle with his civil servants over increasing the amount of recycling programmes at the expense of planned incinerators. Civil servants have been lobbied by the waste industry to increase incineration, but Mr Meacher secured last minute changes before the paper went to the printers. Mr Kraemer, who oversees waste policies across the EU, said he hoped Britain would adopt recycling as its main way to dispose of waste. At present 70% of Britain's waste is dumped in landfill sites and less than 9% is recycled.

He was also one of the most sagacious, uncompromising and punctilious archbishops of All England, a quiet-mannered family man who wore the purple amethyst on his ring finger humbly.</p> <p>His primacy, from 1974 to 1980, although comparatively short in years, revived the morale of the church of England without arresting its statistical decline. He gave new impetus within the worldwide Anglican communion; initiated vigorous attempts to unify, or at least bring closer together, churches of different confessions; and made a series of bold, if naive, attempts to evangelise the nation.</p> <p>Coggan's disciplined and distinctive primatial style was heightened from its outset by the contrast it set when compared with that of his immediate predecessor, the Rt Rev Michael (later Lord) Ramsey. A visibly spiritual figure, whose white hair was in the clouds while his feet seemed more at home in carpet slippers, Ramsey spent 13 years trying to avoid administration. Coggan, whose dedication was equally transparent, was the scholarly theologian with a tape recorder handy for prompt dictation, and a meticulousness equal to that of any company director.</p> <p>His first meeting with the media, on a spring day in 1974 as the 101st primate-elect, was typical. Shortly before going into Church House, Westminster, he knew he would be questioned closely about being only a \"caretaker primate.\" After all, he was already 65, and, at most, could serve little more than five years, according to the church of England's new laws.</p> <p>Coggan saw the significance, excused himself and took a purposeful stroll beneath the trees. He returned with a well-phrased reply for the waiting journalists. Yes, he said, taking \"caretaker\" at its broadest meaning, he would regard it as an honour to take care of his beloved church for five or whatever number of years.</p> <p>So it was that his primacy was distinguished by good, if not altogether fulfilled, intentions. Throughout, he re-emphasised and reaffirmed the importance of the parochial ministry as the bedrock of the church of England's ties with the English people. He sought, as a priority, to strengthen and encourage the Anglican family, 65m souls around the globe, uncertain at that time of the way it was travelling and with whom.</p> <p>Coggan's primacy was, in fact, a turning point for the Anglican communion. A Lambeth conference, the gathering of the communion's bishops every 10 years, was due. An indefatigable host, he broke with precedent and led the spiritual elders into secret conclave on a Canterbury hilltop - up till then they had met in London and in public. Real and deep anxieties were aired.</p> <p>If his time on the throne of St Augustine had a flaw, it was simply that Coggan often seemed to be an archbishop in a hurry. Certainly, his translation from the archbishopric of York had left him with little time. He was also obviously - and early - influenced by what he saw of the world. Even then, it seemed to many to be rushing to the point of exhaustion, weighed down by over-population and depleting natural resources, and failing to bridge the gap between the rich and poor.</p> <p>Coggan's Call To The Nation (1975), which grew out of his earlier Call To The North, written while he was still at York, was brave, but sociologically ill-prepared and verbally uninspired. It never fulfilled its potential. Nevertheless, it stirred 28,000 ordinary people to write to Lambeth palace about the way of life they most desired. They included those who addressed the primate as \"Dear Lord,\" and some others as \"Your Grace, Chief Godman.\" The nationwide initiative in evangelism, another of his personally inspired outreach projects, showed similar faults.</p> <p>But Coggan had an ecclesiastical courage which owed nothing to naivety. In 1977, for example, on the Pope's own patch in Rome, he jettisoned all diplomacy and called for inter-communion between the Anglican and Roman Catholic churches. His plea was uncharacteristically spectacular.</p> <p>He took another such stance a year later when he preached in Westminster cathedral. This time, out of courtesy to his close friend across the Thames, Cardinal Basil Hume, Coggan made his text known to him in advance.</p> <p>But each time, he knowingly stirred the brethren, some to react in an unbrotherly way, in pursuit of his deep desire for the reunion of Christendom. He attended the enthronement in 1978 of Pope John Paul II, the first archbishop of Canterbury to be present at such a ceremony since the reformation.</p> <p>He was a strong - and early - supporter of the ordination of women; indeed, he proposed the reform at the Lambeth conference in 1970. Reaching out to other faiths, he will also be remembered for his support for the Council of Christians and Jews.</p> <p>Donald Coggan was born in Highgate, north London, educated at Merchant Taylors' school, Northwood, Middlesex, and St John's College, Cambridge, and was in his mid-teens when the call to be ordained came to him.</p> <p>The orderliness, which was to characterise his ministry, immediately began to show itself.

Placing a time limit on sanctions is an innovation for the UN. The resolution, agreed after three days of horse-trading, is a French compromise between the US and British wish for an indefinite ban and Russia and China's opposition to any embargo. The vote was unanimous. Nancy Soderberg, the deputy US ambassador, said: \"I think it sends an unequivocal and strong message to the parties to bring an end to this conflict.\" The ban covers the sale and supply of weapons, ammunition, military vehicles, equipment and spare parts and the provision of training and technical aid. It has no immediate impact on British arms trade, as an EU ban has been in place since last year. It will be terminated as soon as the UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, reports that \"a peaceful definitive settlement of the conflict\" has been concluded. The compromise was born of the concern of some council members about the sanctions on Iraq, now in their 10th year. Eritrea and Ethiopia both denounced the ban. The Eritreans said it was unfair because Ethiopia was the aggressor. The Ethiopian spokesman said it was \"wrong and meaningless.\" The ban will have little practical effect in the short term, other than sending a message to both countries that the UN is concerned about the serious consequences for regional stability. Russia, which had been supplying arms to both sides, objected that diplomatic means had not been exhausted, but backed down when the compromise was offered. At Russia's request, the resolution calls for a representative from the Organisation of African Unity to visit the area to try to secure a peace deal. Eritrea will agree to a ceasefire only if both sides pull back to their original positions on the disputed border. Ethiopia wants a peace deal agreed before a ceasefire. The resolution regretted that the diversion of resources to the conflict was affecting efforts to address the region's food crisis.",

The thousands of empty beer bottles are perhaps the clearest sign that the army feels it is on the verge of victory. Colonel Ghebre Kidan of the Ethiopian army said the capture of Barentu had cut the Eritrean supply lines and had effectively ended the war on the western front. But his aim of \"ensuring that this invading army is never capable of occupying our territory again\" seems a more distant objective. There remain the central Zalambessa front and the eastern Bure front, both of which have seen heavy fighting in the past few days. The offensive began on Friday, just days after the US ambassador to the UN, Richard Holbrooke, completed the latest of a series of efforts by African and western leaders and diplomats to end the conflict peacefully. In a show of strength and a test of political will, the Eritrean forces pushed into Ethiopia in May 1998 as relations between the two former allies deteriorated because of economic differences. Eritrea did not plan for the disaster that has since unfolded in a bitter conflict which has divided families and friends and cost both countries hundreds of millions of pounds, tens of thousands of lives, and a significant loss of standing in the international community. Ethiopian officials, not known for their candour, are now openly giddy with their troops' success in the past few days. They now control large swaths of southern Eritrea, and hope that this offensive will put an end to the war, put Eritrea in its place, and let their countries restart their much needed development. The international community was swift to condemn the latest outbreak of fighting, calling it a \"senseless war\", and gave both parties 72 hours to end hostilities or face sanctions. That call went unheeded and the United Nations, blighted by a string of recent peacekeeping failures in Africa, has now imposed a one-year arms embargo on both countries. But that may be too late. Both sides have embarked on costly rearmament programmes since the war began, and an Ethiopian spokesman said yesterday: \"We are now getting all the weapons we need from the defeated Eritrean forces.

But hard cases make lousy law.\"</p> <p>Lord Hurd said any criminal justice policy statement which failed to include an analysis of the state of prisons was inadequate. \"It gives credence to the illusion that we need not bother about our prisons because they are simply wastepaper baskets into which we can toss those of our fellow citizens about whom we wish to hear nothing further,\" he said in a Prison Reform Trust article written before Mr Hague's well-trailed speech yesterday.</p> <p>He argued that it was \"frivolous to propose yet further increases in the prison population without tackling, or even acknowledging\" the problem that prison overcrowding meant they simply became nurseries of further crime.

      "bodyText": "The former Tory home secretary, Douglas Hurd, last night rounded on William Hague's new Conservative law and order policy by warning that prisons were not simply \"wastepaper baskets into which we can toss those of our fellow citizens about whom we wish to hear nothing further\". As penal reformers last night estimated that Mr Hague's latest plans outlined to the Police Federation yesterday could add 15,000 to the current prison population, and the party leader's spokesman declined to publish any costings, Lord Hurd warned: \"An adversarial competition between the parties simply shouting 'I can send more people to prison than you' gets us nowhere, indeed will drive us backwards.\" Mr Hague's remarks in the wake of the Tony Martin case had already made him anxious, he said. \"There is certainly a case for looking carefully at the definition of reasonable force in self defence. But hard cases make lousy law.\" Lord Hurd said any criminal justice policy statement which failed to include an analysis of the state of prisons was inadequate. \"It gives credence to the illusion that we need not bother about our prisons because they are simply wastepaper baskets into which we can toss those of our fellow citizens about whom we wish to hear nothing further,\" he said in a Prison Reform Trust article written before Mr Hague's well-trailed speech yesterday. He argued that it was \"frivolous to propose yet further increases in the prison population without tackling, or even acknowledging\" the problem that prison overcrowding meant they simply became nurseries of further crime. The Conservative leader, in a speech well received by his police audience in Brighton, attacked exactly this kind of \"liberal thinking\" on crime which he claimed had pervaded the criminal justice system for the last 40 years. The only period when crime had fallen was when Michael Howard was home secretary. Criminals were not victims and he wanted to see a criminal justice system that \"scares the hell out of criminals\". Without directly attacking Sir William Macpherson, the author of the official report into the murder of black teenager, Stephen Lawrence, Mr Hague won warm applause when he complained that his finding of 'institutional racism' in the police had been \"lifted out of context and used by some to brand tens of thousands of decent, unprejudiced police officers as racists. \"This is a travesty of the truth... we need more police officers and less political correctness. In other words we need more PCs and less PC,\" he said. After making clear that he is a firm admirer of the American \"zero tolerance\" policies and intends to develop a British version, Mr Hague outlined his new policy proposals. They included: \u0095 Abolition of early release on licence so criminals serve the full term ordered by the judge in open court. \u0095 Halt the early release of serious criminals from prison by restricting the home detention curfew tagging scheme. \u0095 Court action to be taken after first breach of a probation order. \u0095 Breach of conditional discharge will lead automatically to sentencing for the original crime. \u0095 Up to 10 more secure training centres to take persistent young offenders off the streets. \u0095 Extend attorney general's right of appeal against lenient sentences to offences such as grievous bodily harm, actual bodily harm, burglary and racially aggravated offences. \u0095 Reaffirming the Tory commitment to restore the cut in police numbers over the past three years. Last night the home secretary, Jack Straw, wrote to Mr Hague telling him Labour would be coming forward soon with its own proposals to extend the right of appeal against lenient sentences, and asking why he and Ann Widdecombe voted against similar proposals two years ago.",

Frasier's discerning devotees are nauseated by the \"love-me-I'm-so-cute\" simperings of Friends, and don't want the coy domestic mini-dramas of Mad About You. They want to see Dr Frasier Crane, the psychiatrist who really wants to be on Broadway, failing to heed his own counselling and demonstrating all the wrong ways to run personal relationships.

It's a demographic freak, daring to assume the existence of an educated, urbane audience who might be interested in sitcom relationships that go beyond teenagers having sex, twentysomethings getting jobs and having sex, or thirtysomethings having sex and buying houses together. In many respects it seems like a flashback to the Hollywood comedies of the 30s and 40s, when even the minor roles were filled with skilled character actors and it hadn't yet occurred to anybody that you didn't begin shooting before you'd found a well-crafted script, after which you spent time honing and polishing it. The Frasier actors' collective bristles with strength in depth, from David Hyde Pierce's Emmy-winning efforts as Niles to Peri Gilpin's loudly blue- collar Roz Doyle and Jane Leeves' deeply eccentric personification of Daphne, the Mancunian home-care worker who stumbles blithely through the shenanigans in the Crane family madhouse. </p> <p>The rest of the week's TV news from the States spelt out what Frasier is up against on the ratings battlefield.

He is also working on pilots for various series through his own production company, Grammnet Productions, and has another project on the boil for NBC in the shape of Neurotic Tendencies, which was dreamed up by his wife Camille.

With the discovery that around 13,500 acres have been planted with rape seed contaminated by GM, the worst fears of environmentalist campaigners and the worst suspicions of the public have proved to be justified: all the national and international regulations on GM are not worth the paper they are printed on. </p> <p>The seed company, Advanta, is \"gobsmacked\" by the discovery that its rape seed grown on the Canadian prairies was contaminated by GM crops 800 metres away. Yet scientists warned of just this possibility, and the politicians refused to listen and promised us that a mere 200 metres offered a cordon sanitaire in UK test sites. Now this has been proved wrong, the government has made matters much worse by sitting on the information for a month and then slipping it out surreptitiously in a written parliamentary answer. Why should we now believe Nick Brown on anything he says on GM? Ministers' credibility on this subject is irrevocably damaged and they largely have themselves to blame. </p> <p>This sorry tale raises serious questions about whether the GM genie is now out of the bottle, beyond the control of any national government - the Advanta seed has been planted in Germany, France and Sweden. It shows how impossible it has become to produce GM-free seeds; Advanta has moved its seed production out of Alberta to eastern Ontario, New Zealand and Montana in a bid to keep its seeds GM-free. But such is the dramatic advance of GM in major agricultural countries like the US, Brazil, China and India that keeping any part of the globe GM-free is now close to an impossible dream. This is an abysmal failure of international action. </p> <p>But it is not yet time to throw up our hands in despair.

      "bodyText": "The government's carefully constructed policy on the growing of genetically modified crops lies today in ruins. With the discovery that around 13,500 acres have been planted with rape seed contaminated by GM, the worst fears of environmentalist campaigners and the worst suspicions of the public have proved to be justified: all the national and international regulations on GM are not worth the paper they are printed on. The seed company, Advanta, is \"gobsmacked\" by the discovery that its rape seed grown on the Canadian prairies was contaminated by GM crops 800 metres away. Yet scientists warned of just this possibility, and the politicians refused to listen and promised us that a mere 200 metres offered a cordon sanitaire in UK test sites. Now this has been proved wrong, the government has made matters much worse by sitting on the information for a month and then slipping it out surreptitiously in a written parliamentary answer. Why should we now believe Nick Brown on anything he says on GM? Ministers' credibility on this subject is irrevocably damaged and they largely have themselves to blame. This sorry tale raises serious questions about whether the GM genie is now out of the bottle, beyond the control of any national government - the Advanta seed has been planted in Germany, France and Sweden. It shows how impossible it has become to produce GM-free seeds; Advanta has moved its seed production out of Alberta to eastern Ontario, New Zealand and Montana in a bid to keep its seeds GM-free. But such is the dramatic advance of GM in major agricultural countries like the US, Brazil, China and India that keeping any part of the globe GM-free is now close to an impossible dream. This is an abysmal failure of international action. But it is not yet time to throw up our hands in despair. At the very least the government has a responsibility to give us accurate information in this brave new GM world. It has belatedly announced that it will follow the lead of the German state of Baden-Wurttemberg, which discovered the Advanta rogue seeds, and institute spot checks on conventional seeds. Now to shore up its credibility, the government should vigorously defend the policy commitments it has made to have no commercial GM crops until 2003. And that means digging up and destroying these GM contaminated crops as soon as possible.",

Any delay to the hydroelectric project will cost millions of pounds a month. The lake will soon be full and the generators fully working.</p> <p>Birecik is part of the same ambitious scheme as the pro posed Ilisu dam, which has caused such controversy in Britain. Opponents of Ilisu argue that British money should not finance a project which will flood the ancient town of Hasankeyf. But the Ilisu dam is still on the drawing board: the loss of Zeugma is an imminent reality.</p> <p>Under a blazing sun, the mosaics are covered in white fabric and cut between the tiny stones into sections. Then they are dug carefully from the dusty earth.</p> <p>At the Gaziantep museum the most recent arrivals are simply stacked in the garden waiting to be pieced back together.</p> <p>\"Of course I'm upset,\" the museum's acting director Hakki Alkan, said.</p> <p>\"But this is state policy. Energy issues always take precedence over any cultural considerations.\"</p> <p>Belatedly, the state has devised a plan to try to save as much as possible of what could become a huge tourist attraction and a site of international interest.</p> <p>Optimists hope that on the hill-tops above the water of the new lake will be as yet undiscovered wonders of the past, including ancient Zeugma's temple.</p> <p>\"We will excavate the second and third layers of the old city, the tourism minister said on a visit to a site which is about to disappear. \"There is no need for any delay.\"</p> <p>But a huge amount will be lost under the water. \"Every room has a mosaic,\" Yusuf Yavas said. \"There may be one hundred villas here that we will never have the chance to find.\"</p> <p>About half way between the archaeological dig and the imposing new dam stands the present-day village of Belkis. It is about to share the fate of its ancient predecessor.</p> <p>The school is almost submerged. Clusters of yellow-brick buildings have already become isolated islands in the calm blue waters.</p> <p>Bewildered villagers say they have yet to receive all the compensation they are owed by the state. Some of them are still hard at work knocking down their own houses. They will take the bricks and timber with them to sell, rather than watch them disappear intact.</p> <p>\"I've seen the mosaics, they're beautiful\", said Ali Ozler. \"But I rather liked my house as well. Who cares about that?\"</p> <p>Perhaps no one will ever know quite what is being lost at Zeugma. A unique bronze statue of the war god Mars was found a few weeks ago, as well as the largest collection of ceramic Roman seal inscriptions anywhere in the world.</p> <p>Within weeks it will all be academic. As the waters seep into the ruins, Turkey will take another step towards alleviating its electricity shortage and irrigating new tracts of land to create badly needed jobs.</p> <p>Fifteen metres below the surface of a man-made lake, the unknown treasures of ancient Rome will be abandoned for ever.</p>",

Sporadic excavations have been conducted in Zeugma for several years, but it was only last September that serious money was made available. \"I just can't understand why we're not being given more time,\" said Jelal Kucuk, an art restorer, who is helping remove the mosaics to a museum in the nearby city of Gaziantep. \"Just a few months could make a huge difference\". But the state has made its decision. Any delay to the hydroelectric project will cost millions of pounds a month. The lake will soon be full and the generators fully working. Birecik is part of the same ambitious scheme as the pro posed Ilisu dam, which has caused such controversy in Britain. Opponents of Ilisu argue that British money should not finance a project which will flood the ancient town of Hasankeyf. But the Ilisu dam is still on the drawing board: the loss of Zeugma is an imminent reality. Under a blazing sun, the mosaics are covered in white fabric and cut between the tiny stones into sections. Then they are dug carefully from the dusty earth. At the Gaziantep museum the most recent arrivals are simply stacked in the garden waiting to be pieced back together. \"Of course I'm upset,\" the museum's acting director Hakki Alkan, said. \"But this is state policy. Energy issues always take precedence over any cultural considerations.\" Belatedly, the state has devised a plan to try to save as much as possible of what could become a huge tourist attraction and a site of international interest. Optimists hope that on the hill-tops above the water of the new lake will be as yet undiscovered wonders of the past, including ancient Zeugma's temple. \"We will excavate the second and third layers of the old city, the tourism minister said on a visit to a site which is about to disappear. \"There is no need for any delay.\" But a huge amount will be lost under the water. \"Every room has a mosaic,\" Yusuf Yavas said. \"There may be one hundred villas here that we will never have the chance to find.\" About half way between the archaeological dig and the imposing new dam stands the present-day village of Belkis. It is about to share the fate of its ancient predecessor. The school is almost submerged. Clusters of yellow-brick buildings have already become isolated islands in the calm blue waters. Bewildered villagers say they have yet to receive all the compensation they are owed by the state. Some of them are still hard at work knocking down their own houses. They will take the bricks and timber with them to sell, rather than watch them disappear intact. \"I've seen the mosaics, they're beautiful\", said Ali Ozler. \"But I rather liked my house as well. Who cares about that?\" Perhaps no one will ever know quite what is being lost at Zeugma. A unique bronze statue of the war god Mars was found a few weeks ago, as well as the largest collection of ceramic Roman seal inscriptions anywhere in the world. Within weeks it will all be academic. As the waters seep into the ruins, Turkey will take another step towards alleviating its electricity shortage and irrigating new tracts of land to create badly needed jobs. Fifteen metres below the surface of a man-made lake, the unknown treasures of ancient Rome will be abandoned for ever.",

      "bodyText": "Actor James Casey got a total of 10 weeks' work in the theatre last year. He is currently temping for Croydon health authority. \"I had two acting jobs last year, a London fringe production of Julius Caesar and a Restoration comedy in Guildford. I started on \u00a3150 a week. Then for eight weeks I earned the Equity union minimum of \u00a3210,\" Mr Casey said. He has a classics degree from Cambridge University and has spent two years looking for a long-term acting contract. Between acting jobs, Mr Casey, 22, signed on to the jobseeker's allowance, temped, and worked as a website designer and a school computer technician. \"Everyone who goes into acting knows it's oversubscribed. The death of rep has stifled opportunity,\" he said. The latest British Actors Equity Association survey shows that professional actors get an average of 11 weeks' theatre work a year. Dancers get 14 weeks' work, variety performers, such as ventriloquists and cabaret acts, get 15 weeks a year, and stage managers get 17 weeks. Around 42% of performers earn under \u00a35,000 a year from the entertainment industry. A total of 24% earn nothing at all from entertainment. \"The lack of theatre work affects the craft because out of work actors are not practising or using their voices. \"A lot of resting actors I know do unpaid amateur dramatics because it allows them to keep their hand in,\" Mr Casey said. \"Every now and again I wonder if I'm wasting my time, but you cannot do this unless you secretly believe that one day you will make it.\" Strategies for success ... or recovery The New Victoria Theatre, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire Tonight's first night of Jack To A King at the Vic, an in-the-round auditorium with 605 seats, is already sold out. The Vic's strategies, featuring a broadening of its programming to win new audiences, are broadly in line with those suggested by the Arts Council in its report published yesterday. Two years ago the theatre had a deficit of of \u00a3208,000. That has now been whittled down to \u00a360,000. \"We were adamant that the deficit should not increase but we decided to trade our way out of our problems rather than reduce our activities,\" said the general manager Ludo Keston. \"We have increased our activities from 44 to 49 weeks a year, increased the number of performances, and established an education and outreach department to reconnect the theatre to the community.\" Aware of the decline in the traditional audience for drama, the Vic has varied its programme and substantially increased the number of concerts and one night stands it presents. \"It's a question of diversifying the product,\" added Mr Keston. \"Theatres exist to serve all the audiences of their districts, not just playgoers. We are using sophisticated marketing techniques to persuade people who come to one night events to come to plays as well.\" The theatre has set up links with theatres in Bolton and Scarborough and has invested \u00a320,000 on preparing a bid for funding, which brought in \u00a370,000 over three years for work with young people at risk of offending, people with learning disabilities, and chil dren under seven and their families. \"We have worked with 12,000 people in the first year,\" added Mr Keston. \"It's an example of how investment can reap rewards.\" The Wolsey Theatre, Ipswich, Suffolk The 400-seat Wolsey opened in Ipswich, the home town of Trevor Nunn, who is now the director of the Royal National Theatre, in 1977, and ran as a traditional rep theatre for many years. It was funded with \u00a35.75m of public money but went dark last year, with a deficit of \u00a3198,000, after lean years in which it struggled to stay afloat. It eventually went into receivership and sold off its stock of costumes and props. Now it is planning to stage a comeback, and five applicants for the \u00a335,000-a-year job of artisitic director will be interviewed next week. The person appointed will be charged with creating a mixed programme with a wide appeal, and some shows will be bought in. \"We are going to make sure we go back to an extremely high standard,\" said Robin Chesterman, chairman of the theatre's trust. He added: \"We have to find a younger audience and we have to create networks with theatres in Norwich, Bury St Edmunds and Colchester. \"Our loyal playgoers will have to be nurtured, but in line with the Arts Council report, we have to go out and seek new audiences.\" One possible change, designed to find extra seats on which to plant bums, will be to move from the present thrust stage arrangement to a traditional proscenium.",

      "bodyText": "The Arts Council of England said yesterday that \u00a325m a year needed to be pumped into subsidised theatre to breathe new life into what it described as an \"art form in crisis\". The council's chairman, Gerry Robinson, said at the launch of a report which tells of declining audiences, fewer performances and tours, less challenging plays and soaring deficits: \"Although our theatre is among the best in the world, it is in dire need. \"We must reinvent the best of the past and encourage the writers, artists and productions of tomorrow.\" The council says the status quo - caused by inadequate funding lasting more than 15 years - is not an option. Without new cash some theatres would probably close. It outlines a scheme of reinvigoration which is likely to depress traditionalists who will see it as the final nail in the coffin of the rep system. But it is likely to be welcomed by others eager to win new young audiences for high-quality productions. Victoria Todd, director of the National Campaign for the Arts, said: \"I applaud this idea and \u00a325m would be a big increase in arts spending. \"But my fear is that it will all be tears before bedtime if the money does not come through. I'll be the first to jump on my desk and cheer if it does but theatres have been in crisis for so long it could be too late.\" The report, The Next Stage, amplifies issues identified in research commissioned from Peter Boyden Associates which bluntly pointed out that the producing theatres' problems were caused by years of underfunding. The council and the 10 regional arts boards now spend \u00a370m a year on 40 touring companies, 160 theatres which buy in productions, and 50 theatres from Plymouth to Newcastle upon Tyne which produce their own shows. But the report shows that producing theatres have run up a total deficit of \u00a34.4m and performances by touring companies have fallen by 24% in six years leading to an audience drop of 28%. The average actor now worked for only 11 weeks a year, said the report. An \"attitudinal change\" was needed among funders and the theatre community, parts of which had become \"insular and territorial\" and unable because of repeated cash crises to commission new work or take advantage of new talent. \"Theatre cannot rely on the recollections of a post-war golden era and the loyalty of audiences who grew up in a period when theatre was the dominant art form. \"A dynamic contemporary theatre must draw on that which has meaning and substance from the past but without being constrained by it. \"It must also respond to a multicultural Britain, embracing a wider range of forms and traditions; to a digital Britain seeking creative uses for emerging technologies; and to a Britain of the regions which celebrate local cultural distinctiveness alongside a commitment to international excellence.\" The council wants to create a more flexible theatre network which can preserve the best of the past and encourage the writers and artists of tomorrow, while developing new education and community schemes. The network should engage a new generation of young people with work that was relevant to their lives and would surprise them \"with its immediacy and imaginative power\". More theatres are likely to present a mixed economy of in-house, touring and bought-in work. However, some, such as Birmingham Rep and the Royal Exchange in Manchester, will probably continue principally as production centres. The council says that it will no longer dilute its ambition by funding theatres at less than effective levels. In a clear warning to the government, it adds: \"If insufficient funds are available, the Arts Council may not be able to make available the resources to fund all the theatres who buy into its policy and vision. \"Some may have to scale down, some may have to close.\" The report is the first stage in the creation of a national policy for theatre in England. Over the next two months, wide ranging discussions will take place with arts boards, local councils and the theatre community to agree the policy and decide on ways it can be delivered.

      "body": "<p>Since he moved from Warwickshire to Derbyshire, Tim Munton has been magically transformed from one of county cricket's most respected players into someone marginally more accident-prone than Jacques Tati's Monsieur Hulot. </p> <p>In the previous match against Yorkshire, at Headingley this month, he suffered painful blows on each arm and had to retire. Then, while practising, he took a heavy blow on a knee. And yesterday, while having a few gentle throw-downs in the indoor school before the start of play, one delivery reared and struck him between the eyes. </p> <p>He was taken to hospital and when, hours later, it was reported that he was still there, there were fears of complications. In fact he needed only a few stitches above his left eye. But running into a five-hour wait at A&amp;E represents a nasty accident in itself. </p> <p>It is hardly surprising, then, that when Munton asked to play in a club match recently the club refused to grant permission, fearing he would do himself a mischief. </p> <p>When Yorkshire, replying to 303, were 112 without loss, Derbyshire's captain Dominic Cork must have missed Munton hugely. But then something happened. </p> <p>Matthew Cassar's cricket career is so modest that he is best known for being the husband of Jane Cassar, the England women's wicketkeeper. But he is having a good match. </p> <p>On Wednesday he scored 47, more than anything he managed last season. And now he took three wickets in nine balls without conceding a run. </p> <p>First he had David Byas caught behind, then he had Richard Blakey well caught by Paul Aldred at third slip, and bowling with gathering pace he had Richard Harden caught behind with a sharp lifter. </p> <p>Normally a tepid third-change seamer, Cassar was by now bowling with real hostility. The coach Colin Wells said afterwards: \"Matt has had a lot of injuries but is more confident in his body these days.\" </p> <p>With Vic Craven also falling, this time to the off-spin of Simon Lacey, Yorkshire, who in the morning had led the provisional table, had lost four wickets in as many overs for four runs. </p> <p>They closed on 171 for six, 132 adrift, after Matt Wood had been caught behind and the nightwatchman Paul Hutchison had perished leg-before offering only a half-hearted stroke, both victims of Cork. </p> <p>In only his second championship innings Craven, 19, played with surprising maturity and restraint for his maiden first-class half-century. Most of his seven fours were cuts off Lacey. </p> <p>Earlier Derbyshire, resuming on 285 for eight, were all out when Trevor Smith was bowled by Gavin Hamilton. With Munton at the mercy of the NHS the innings closed with nine down. Rain then washed out play until after lunch.</p>",

In the previous match against Yorkshire, at Headingley this month, he suffered painful blows on each arm and had to retire. Then, while practising, he took a heavy blow on a knee. And yesterday, while having a few gentle throw-downs in the indoor school before the start of play, one delivery reared and struck him between the eyes. He was taken to hospital and when, hours later, it was reported that he was still there, there were fears of complications. In fact he needed only a few stitches above his left eye. But running into a five-hour wait at A&amp;E represents a nasty accident in itself. It is hardly surprising, then, that when Munton asked to play in a club match recently the club refused to grant permission, fearing he would do himself a mischief. When Yorkshire, replying to 303, were 112 without loss, Derbyshire's captain Dominic Cork must have missed Munton hugely. But then something happened. Matthew Cassar's cricket career is so modest that he is best known for being the husband of Jane Cassar, the England women's wicketkeeper. But he is having a good match. On Wednesday he scored 47, more than anything he managed last season. And now he took three wickets in nine balls without conceding a run. First he had David Byas caught behind, then he had Richard Blakey well caught by Paul Aldred at third slip, and bowling with gathering pace he had Richard Harden caught behind with a sharp lifter. Normally a tepid third-change seamer, Cassar was by now bowling with real hostility. The coach Colin Wells said afterwards: \"Matt has had a lot of injuries but is more confident in his body these days.\" With Vic Craven also falling, this time to the off-spin of Simon Lacey, Yorkshire, who in the morning had led the provisional table, had lost four wickets in as many overs for four runs. They closed on 171 for six, 132 adrift, after Matt Wood had been caught behind and the nightwatchman Paul Hutchison had perished leg-before offering only a half-hearted stroke, both victims of Cork. In only his second championship innings Craven, 19, played with surprising maturity and restraint for his maiden first-class half-century. Most of his seven fours were cuts off Lacey. Earlier Derbyshire, resuming on 285 for eight, were all out when Trevor Smith was bowled by Gavin Hamilton. With Munton at the mercy of the NHS the innings closed with nine down. Rain then washed out play until after lunch.",

In 1924, Arthur Gilligan and Maurice Tate disposed of South Africa in 12.3 overs, the fastest ever, and in that match in Mohali, Chris Cairns, Dion Nash and Shayne O'Connor required only 27 overs to see off India. </p> <p>Yesterday it took Giddins, together with Darren Gough (two for 36), and Caddick (three for 28) all of 30.3 overs. Chris Schofield, the young leg-spinner making his debut, England having omitted Craig White and Steve Harmison, never got a sniff and if the pitch remains frisky under the covers he may well not do. </p> <p>Zimbabwe may consider themselves unfortunate in some regards. The situation at home must be preying on their minds more than they care to let on. Because of the weather they have not had a decent run-up to this match and they lost a toss they dearly would have loved to win. Hussain has now won seven out of nine since he became captain. </p> <p>Then they encountered Caddick, who produced an inspirational opening burst that brought him three wickets in nine balls, removing Grant Flower - beautifully yorked - and Trevor Gripper, caught at the wicket, with deliveries of world class, and Alistair Campbell courtesy of a stroke he will wish to bury with a stake through its heart. </p> <p>He ought to have had a fourth wicket too, when Andy Flower got an inside edge to Alec Stewart behind the stumps only to see the umpire Dave Orchard turn down the appeal. </p> <p>This, it seemed, was to be Caddick's day and, competitive fellows that these bowlers are, each wishing to outdo the other, he must have been seething quietly that it was not. After eight overs Giddins replaced him and with his fourth ball had Andy Flower, Zimbabwe's most prolific test batsman, caught at first slip. </p> <p>It was shortly before lunch that Giddins got his big break, for had Guy Whittall seen out the last over of the session then Caddick surely would have returned after the interval. Insteadan attempted bouncer - let us be charitable here - was miscued on to his stumps as he tried to pull. </p> <p>Giddins had one ball of the over remaining and when play resumed he continued his spell. Bad light and a rain shower intervened in the middle of another over from him and when Heath Streak edged the first ball of the resumption to first slip it would have taken a nuclear blast to have got the ball from Giddins. </p> <p>Bryan Strang was promptly caught at short leg and Neil Johnson, who made a century against Australia on this very strip in the World Cup - the last time it was used - skied to extra cover. </p> <p>England's reply was far from steady. Ramprakash almost dragged his second ball on to his stumps, was dropped horrendously at the wicket by Andy Flower when seven and would have been run out by Brian Murphy's brilliant fielding when 15 had the throw hit. In the following over, though, he propped forward to Streak and, after due deliberation, was given out lbw by Peter Willey. </p> <p>Some years ago in similar circumstances Ramprakash, disgruntled, muttered to another umpire, Darrell Hair, that he was \"messing with my career\". He would have thought twice with Willey, who like all the international umpires is now sponsored by Happy Shopper. Willey does not do happy.</p>",

Because of the weather they have not had a decent run-up to this match and they lost a toss they dearly would have loved to win. Hussain has now won seven out of nine since he became captain. Then they encountered Caddick, who produced an inspirational opening burst that brought him three wickets in nine balls, removing Grant Flower - beautifully yorked - and Trevor Gripper, caught at the wicket, with deliveries of world class, and Alistair Campbell courtesy of a stroke he will wish to bury with a stake through its heart. He ought to have had a fourth wicket too, when Andy Flower got an inside edge to Alec Stewart behind the stumps only to see the umpire Dave Orchard turn down the appeal. This, it seemed, was to be Caddick's day and, competitive fellows that these bowlers are, each wishing to outdo the other, he must have been seething quietly that it was not. After eight overs Giddins replaced him and with his fourth ball had Andy Flower, Zimbabwe's most prolific test batsman, caught at first slip. It was shortly before lunch that Giddins got his big break, for had Guy Whittall seen out the last over of the session then Caddick surely would have returned after the interval. Insteadan attempted bouncer - let us be charitable here - was miscued on to his stumps as he tried to pull. Giddins had one ball of the over remaining and when play resumed he continued his spell. Bad light and a rain shower intervened in the middle of another over from him and when Heath Streak edged the first ball of the resumption to first slip it would have taken a nuclear blast to have got the ball from Giddins. Bryan Strang was promptly caught at short leg and Neil Johnson, who made a century against Australia on this very strip in the World Cup - the last time it was used - skied to extra cover. England's reply was far from steady. Ramprakash almost dragged his second ball on to his stumps, was dropped horrendously at the wicket by Andy Flower when seven and would have been run out by Brian Murphy's brilliant fielding when 15 had the throw hit. In the following over, though, he propped forward to Streak and, after due deliberation, was given out lbw by Peter Willey. Some years ago in similar circumstances Ramprakash, disgruntled, muttered to another umpire, Darrell Hair, that he was \"messing with my career\". He would have thought twice with Willey, who like all the international umpires is now sponsored by Happy Shopper. Willey does not do happy.",
