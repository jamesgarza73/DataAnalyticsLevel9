      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>You could never argue that success has spoiled Pere Ubu. Twenty-five years after they emerged from the industrial desert of Ohio, Ubu continue to plough a perverse and eccentric furrow, with commendable enthusiasm. \"There are so few of you, yet your appreciation is so precious to us,\" deadpanned David Thomas, still tethered to the helm half a lifetime later. </p> <p>It's Thomas who supplies Ubu's ballast, in every respect. The freakish pitch changes of his voice give warning that no song is safe when he comes near it, while his cryptic introductions have become part of the performance. Scornful of dietary fads, Thomas is still a massively bulky presence at the microphone, a perverse mixture of Orson Welles and John Goodman. </p> <p>Despite creating an illusion of cacophonousness, Ubu play what is basically rock with attitude, with a light dusting of chaos to remind us of their surrealist origins. Thomas spent the first few minutes striking dramatic postures while blowing down what looked like the kind of horn cyclists attach to their handlebars. Then he adorned himself with a red plastic apron covered with electronic gadgetry, enabling him to conjure weird sonic effects from the amplifiers. Even weirder, in fact, than those already coming from the theremin on the opposite side of the stage. </p> <p>Ubu aren't exactly armed to the teeth with \"hits\", but their version of Final Solution was like an explosion in a scrapyard and quite epic in its way. They kept resisting shouts for Non-Alignment Pact but relented at the end, as fans stormed the stage and even ventured a spot of mild pogoing. </p> <p>Ubu were joined for the encore by MC5 veteran Wayne Kramer, whose set earlier in the evening showed he hasn't abandoned hope that rock music has some value as a polemical medium with a political message. As his trio crunched out punkish riffs, Kramer rasped lyrics about sexual exploitation, drugs and bomb-making terrorists, punctuating his bulletins with screaming lead guitar. It was a salutary reminder of a time when people really did believe rock'n'roll could change the world. </p> <p><strong> Dance</strong><br> </p> <p><strong> Ariadone </strong><br> </p> <p><strong> Linbury Studio, Covent Garden *** </strong><br> </p> <p> Ever since Nijinsky premiered his notorious Sacre du Printemps in 1913, the ballet has become a rite of passage for other choreographers. Artists as varied as B\u00e9jart, Pina Bausch and Michael Clark have all felt moved to recreate the work in their own image. How they handle it becomes a defining statement of their style. So it's no surprise that Carlotta Ikeda and her company Ariadone should produce a Rite which bears all the hallmarks of the Japanese expressionist form butoh: its seven female dancers masked from head to toe in white make-up, their bodies scrunched earnestly into slow moving postures of extreme visceral emotion. </p> <p>What is surprising is that this sisterhood of keening, witchy dancers should also look back to 19th century ballet for their inspiration. The work certainly starts in classic butoh mode as the dancers appear wracked by the forces unleashed in Stravinsky's score. With their bodies curled into foetal self-protection and their faces frozen into howling screams, they seem maddened by the intensity of the primal, physical world. At other moments they seem to become nature itself as Ikeda gathers them into churning groups of movement, then lets them disperse into finely drawn tendrils of dance, suggesting flecks of foam on the water or rogue sea breezes. It's a vision of ancient terror and power, a very female vision of death and birth. </p> <p>But then Ikeda seems to be calling up ghosts of older dancers to elaborate her vision, using fragments of Stravinsky's original Rite mixed with sounds of wind and sea, industrial machinery and distant wisps of song. A trio of women in ratty tutus, limbs contorted with savagely subversive humour, become mad little cygnets from Swan Lake.

      "bodyText": "You could never argue that success has spoiled Pere Ubu. Twenty-five years after they emerged from the industrial desert of Ohio, Ubu continue to plough a perverse and eccentric furrow, with commendable enthusiasm. \"There are so few of you, yet your appreciation is so precious to us,\" deadpanned David Thomas, still tethered to the helm half a lifetime later. It's Thomas who supplies Ubu's ballast, in every respect. The freakish pitch changes of his voice give warning that no song is safe when he comes near it, while his cryptic introductions have become part of the performance. Scornful of dietary fads, Thomas is still a massively bulky presence at the microphone, a perverse mixture of Orson Welles and John Goodman. Despite creating an illusion of cacophonousness, Ubu play what is basically rock with attitude, with a light dusting of chaos to remind us of their surrealist origins. Thomas spent the first few minutes striking dramatic postures while blowing down what looked like the kind of horn cyclists attach to their handlebars. Then he adorned himself with a red plastic apron covered with electronic gadgetry, enabling him to conjure weird sonic effects from the amplifiers. Even weirder, in fact, than those already coming from the theremin on the opposite side of the stage. Ubu aren't exactly armed to the teeth with \"hits\", but their version of Final Solution was like an explosion in a scrapyard and quite epic in its way. They kept resisting shouts for Non-Alignment Pact but relented at the end, as fans stormed the stage and even ventured a spot of mild pogoing. Ubu were joined for the encore by MC5 veteran Wayne Kramer, whose set earlier in the evening showed he hasn't abandoned hope that rock music has some value as a polemical medium with a political message. As his trio crunched out punkish riffs, Kramer rasped lyrics about sexual exploitation, drugs and bomb-making terrorists, punctuating his bulletins with screaming lead guitar. It was a salutary reminder of a time when people really did believe rock'n'roll could change the world. Dance Ariadone Linbury Studio, Covent Garden *** Ever since Nijinsky premiered his notorious Sacre du Printemps in 1913, the ballet has become a rite of passage for other choreographers. Artists as varied as B\u00e9jart, Pina Bausch and Michael Clark have all felt moved to recreate the work in their own image. How they handle it becomes a defining statement of their style. So it's no surprise that Carlotta Ikeda and her company Ariadone should produce a Rite which bears all the hallmarks of the Japanese expressionist form butoh: its seven female dancers masked from head to toe in white make-up, their bodies scrunched earnestly into slow moving postures of extreme visceral emotion. What is surprising is that this sisterhood of keening, witchy dancers should also look back to 19th century ballet for their inspiration. The work certainly starts in classic butoh mode as the dancers appear wracked by the forces unleashed in Stravinsky's score. With their bodies curled into foetal self-protection and their faces frozen into howling screams, they seem maddened by the intensity of the primal, physical world. At other moments they seem to become nature itself as Ikeda gathers them into churning groups of movement, then lets them disperse into finely drawn tendrils of dance, suggesting flecks of foam on the water or rogue sea breezes. It's a vision of ancient terror and power, a very female vision of death and birth. But then Ikeda seems to be calling up ghosts of older dancers to elaborate her vision, using fragments of Stravinsky's original Rite mixed with sounds of wind and sea, industrial machinery and distant wisps of song. A trio of women in ratty tutus, limbs contorted with savagely subversive humour, become mad little cygnets from Swan Lake. There are doll like Coppelias whose marionette cuteness is underscored with erotic mischief. Best are the Wilis (the ghosts of jilted women from Giselle) who cross the stage with a haunting off-kilter craziness. The work also neatly turns around the final sacrificial solo in Rite - with Ikeda herself performing a dance of survival, and apparently containing the world's forces within her own inscrutably slow movement. It's a fine image, as fine as many which appear in the work. But its power is diluted by Ikeda's overall failure to pace and build her material. Butoh is always slow, but at best it sustains an intentness, a focus which staves off our restlessness. Ikeda's Haru No Saiten slips in and out of focus too readily within its 80-minute duration. It induces moments of wonderment but whole sections, unfortunately, of boredom too.

      "body": "<p>Shostakovich's 15th Symphony is, for many, one of the composer's most perplexing works. Written when he was seriously ill, it was his last statement in the genre - and, far from taking the form of a self-conscious Mahlerian farewell, it's characterised by an enigmatic inscrutability. </p> <p>In some respects, it pre-empts post-modernism: the music suddenly defines itself by becoming endlessly refer ential. A plethora of quotes and allusions - to Shostakovich's own music, to works by Rossini, Wagner, Glinka and Mahler - are woven into a spectral texture that sounds like a collage of vague reminiscences. Throughout its course, you sense time running out, and the symphony closes in a percussive miasma of ticking clocks and chronometers. The passage derives from Shostakovich's 4th Symphony, suppressed by the composer at the height of Stalin's purges when time was running out in a very different sense. </p> <p>Veteran Kurt Sanderling has long been regarded as one of the work's finest interpreters. Eighty-eight this year, he left Germany for Russia when the Nazis came to power and subsequently worked closely with Shostakovich. He still uses a score of the 15th inscribed and annotated by the composer, and his version consequently has a powerful claim to authenticity. </p> <p>He pares the sonorities down to a sparse, yet sweet clarity. The barrage of quotes is indelibly worked into the symphony's fabric rather than emerging as a sequence of brain-teasing puzzles. Throughout, you feel on unsafe ground as emotions are stirred then quashed by irony. The Philharmonia clearly adore him and the playing was outstanding. Definitive stuff. </p> <p>In some respects, the 15th could be dubbed a \"Sinfonia Concertante\" since it derives much of its dynamism from the contrast between the full orchestra and a series of recitative-like instrumental solos that break in upon the texture. </p> <p>Sanderling tellingly couples it with what is arguably the greatest of all works in the genre: Mozart's E Flat Sinfonia Concertante for violin and viola. A piece of almost operatic resonance, it consistently flashes forward to Cosi fan Tutte, involving its soloists in a sequence of dialogues by turns amorous, argumentative and reconciliatory. </p> <p>The great Gidon Kremer and the brilliant young Latvian viola player Ula Ulijona were the protagonists, with Kremer's exquisite poise and silver tone by turns melding and conflicting with Ulijona's more romantic, rhapsodic approach. Sanderling uses larger orchestral forces than is common in Mozart nowaday, though he more than justifies his decision since the Philharmonia sound was ravishing throughout.</p>",

A plethora of quotes and allusions - to Shostakovich's own music, to works by Rossini, Wagner, Glinka and Mahler - are woven into a spectral texture that sounds like a collage of vague reminiscences. Throughout its course, you sense time running out, and the symphony closes in a percussive miasma of ticking clocks and chronometers. The passage derives from Shostakovich's 4th Symphony, suppressed by the composer at the height of Stalin's purges when time was running out in a very different sense. Veteran Kurt Sanderling has long been regarded as one of the work's finest interpreters. Eighty-eight this year, he left Germany for Russia when the Nazis came to power and subsequently worked closely with Shostakovich. He still uses a score of the 15th inscribed and annotated by the composer, and his version consequently has a powerful claim to authenticity. He pares the sonorities down to a sparse, yet sweet clarity. The barrage of quotes is indelibly worked into the symphony's fabric rather than emerging as a sequence of brain-teasing puzzles. Throughout, you feel on unsafe ground as emotions are stirred then quashed by irony. The Philharmonia clearly adore him and the playing was outstanding. Definitive stuff. In some respects, the 15th could be dubbed a \"Sinfonia Concertante\" since it derives much of its dynamism from the contrast between the full orchestra and a series of recitative-like instrumental solos that break in upon the texture. Sanderling tellingly couples it with what is arguably the greatest of all works in the genre: Mozart's E Flat Sinfonia Concertante for violin and viola. A piece of almost operatic resonance, it consistently flashes forward to Cosi fan Tutte, involving its soloists in a sequence of dialogues by turns amorous, argumentative and reconciliatory. The great Gidon Kremer and the brilliant young Latvian viola player Ula Ulijona were the protagonists, with Kremer's exquisite poise and silver tone by turns melding and conflicting with Ulijona's more romantic, rhapsodic approach. Sanderling uses larger orchestral forces than is common in Mozart nowaday, though he more than justifies his decision since the Philharmonia sound was ravishing throughout.",

Artists as varied as B\u00e9jart, Pina Bausch and Michael Clark have all felt moved to recreate the work in their own image. How they handle it becomes a defining statement of their style. So it's no surprise that Carlotta Ikeda and her company Ariadone should produce a Rite which bears all the hallmarks of the Japanese expressionist form butoh: its seven female dancers masked from head to toe in white make-up, their bodies scrunched earnestly into slow moving postures of extreme visceral emotion. </p> <p>What is surprising is that this sisterhood of keening, witchy dancers should also look back to 19th century ballet for their inspiration. The work certainly starts in classic butoh mode as the dancers appear wracked by the forces unleashed in Stravinsky's score. With their bodies curled into foetal self-protection and their faces frozen into howling screams, they seem maddened by the intensity of the primal, physical world. At other moments they seem to become nature itself as Ikeda gathers them into churning groups of movement, then lets them disperse into finely drawn tendrils of dance, suggesting flecks of foam on the water or rogue sea breezes. It's a vision of ancient terror and power, a very female vision of death and birth. </p> <p>But then Ikeda seems to be calling up ghosts of older dancers to elaborate her vision, using fragments of Stravinsky's original Rite mixed with sounds of wind and sea, industrial machinery and distant wisps of song. A trio of women in ratty tutus, limbs contorted with savagely subversive humour, become mad little cygnets from Swan Lake. There are doll like Coppelias whose marionette cuteness is underscored with erotic mischief. Best are the Wilis (the ghosts of jilted women from Giselle) who cross the stage with a haunting off-kilter craziness. </p> <p>The work also neatly turns around the final sacrificial solo in Rite - with Ikeda herself performing a dance of survival, and apparently containing the world's forces within her own inscrutably slow movement. It's a fine image, as fine as many which appear in the work. But its power is diluted by Ikeda's overall failure to pace and build her material. Butoh is always slow, but at best it sustains an intentness, a focus which staves off our restlessness. Ikeda's Haru No Saiten slips in and out of focus too readily within its 80-minute duration. It induces moments of wonderment but whole sections, unfortunately, of boredom too. </p>",

Marcao, a mid-season purchase to beef up Spartak's attack, scored in the 67th and 81st minutes to help the Moscow side to one of their best wins in European competition, boosting their chances of reaching the second phase. It all looked very different when Sporting's Sa Pinto silenced the capacity 70,000 crowd at the Luzhniki stadium with a 24th-minute goal after the Spartak goalkeeper Alexander Filimonov had dropped the ball following a corner. It was Sporting's goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel who was at fault for Spartak's equaliser in the 43rd minute. He failed to clear the ball and Robson pounced to send his shot over the Danish international. Marco Simone scored a hat-trick as Monaco beat Austria's Sturm Graz 5-0. The result saw Monaco leapfrog the Austrian side into third place behind Galatasaray and Rangers in Group D.

Three more minutes and Arsenal were in front with a goal of delightful invention and simplicity. Kanu's crossfield lob was met by Bergkamp, who nodded it square for the incoming Ljungberg to meet the ball first time and give the goalkeeper no chance. </p> <p>Lazio's response was to replace a midfielder, Dejan Stankovic, with a forward, Attilio Lombardo, at half-time. Stankovic had been cautioned towards the end of the first half for fouling Silvinho and risked dismissal two minutes later for upending Henry. So the change was as much prudent as tactical. </p> <p>Either way this did not seem important as Arsenal needed only 11 minutes of the second half to increase their lead.

      "bodyText": "The beleaguered euro faced a tight race to the end, but the nay-sayers pulled ahead in initial results from a referendum on whether to replace the 125-year-old krone with the EU's common currency. With 40.7 percent of the vote counted, it was 52.5 percent against the euro and 47.5 percent in favor, according to the Interior Ministry. Euro opponents were starting to celebrate as early results showed their side ahead in the Scandinavian country's fifth referendum on EU-related issues since it joined what became the European Union in 1973. Despite a reputation as EU skeptics, Danes have only said no in one of those referendums - in 1992, when they rejected the Maastricht treaty for a common currency and a common defense. \"It looks great. It'a a victory for democracy, for the Danish people, Pia Kjaersgaard, the leader of far-right Danish People's Party that opposes the euro said, as she walked up the main staircase at parliament smiling and holding flowers - surrounded by reporters and photographers. Danish radio reported that turnout among 4 million eligible voters was above 86 percent, near the record 90.1 percent of October 1972, when membership in the then-European Community was approved. The Interior Ministry had yet to issue official figures. The Social Democratic-led government, which has strongly supported the euro, sounded glum but pointed to the narrow margin in results so far. \"I'm not disappointed, but I admit it looks difficult,\" said Economics Minister Marianne Jelved. French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, whose country holds the six-month rotating EU presidency, said that a rejection would not pressure the euro because Denmark's economy makes up only a small part of the EU's economy. \"I have a lot of respect for this country but its size for the European economy is not major,\" he said in Paris. \"I do not think (a rejection) will be a problem for a currency which must be a stable currency at the appropriate level.\" The euro took effect in 11 of 15 EU countries in January 1999 for corporate and investment transactions, with coins and bills to be introduced in January 2002. Denmark, Britain and Sweden opted out, while Greece, initially barred from membership because of high inflation and a budget deficit, will join on January 1. EU officials, who also said a 'yes' vote in Denmark would help the euro but a rejection would have no effect, planned to meet Friday in Brussels, Belgium, to discuss the currency after the Danish. Yesterday's vote was also being closely watched by Sweden and Britain, whose governments support joining the EMU but plan to let the public decide in as-yet referendums. Even non-EU member Norway was watching as it undergoes renewed debate on whether to join the trading bloc at all. British Prime Minister Tony Blair played down the potential impact on a future vote in his country. \"Denmark's got its own decision, we've got our own decision,\" he said. Denmark already ties its fiscal and monetary decisions to those made by the 11-member euro zone, which forms the bulk of its export market.

      "body": "<p>Well, during 40 years in politics, I've been the warm-up man for some really class acts: Jack Jones, Barbara Castle, Neil Kinnock, John Smith, Tony Blair - and even my old mate Dennis Skinner.</p> <p>But in all my days I've never been so proud, so happy, so honoured as to be the warm-up man for the next person coming on this stage - Nelson Mandela.</p> <p>What a week it's been! We had that bridge, sponsored by Unison. I'm not sure after yesterday's \"goings on\" whether it was a \"bridge of sighs\" or a \"bridge over troubled water\".</p> <p>And talking of the bridge, there is an announcement to make. Would the person who at the start of the week stepped in some yellow paint, please report to the standing orders committee?</p> <p>But more importantly, we've had great speeches, frank discussion, robust debate.</p> <p>This party has great ambitions, great desires for our people. But at the end of the day, it's not like opposition. When you're in government, you have to make choices and priorities.</p> <p>That's what Nye Bevan meant when he said \"the language of priorities is the religion of socialism\".</p> <p>And I want to thank all of you for your hard work throughout the year in our policy forums and discussions.</p> <p>We've had the odd disagreement this week. But don't lose sight of the huge range of policies we have determined this week.</p> <p>And wasn't that a great and inspiring speech from Tony on Tuesday - even if he was heckled by baby Leo half way through?</p> <p>Cherie and Tony are so proud of him. They can't wait to take him to his first focus group.</p> <p>And David Blunkett's been listening. David's got the message. Free nursery places for all three-year-olds. That's delivery - just in time for Leo's third birthday.</p> <p>Tony set out his vision and offered us leadership. He said it loud and clear - we have a vision worth fighting for!</p> <p>And, it will take sacrifice, effort: yes, blood; yes, tears; and, well - perhaps I'd better not mention the sweat, Tony.</p> <p>You should worry - he put his arm round me!</p> <p>Anyway, Tony's sent his suit to the cleaners. But I tell you what, at the next election we're going to take that Mr Hague to the cleaners.</p> <p>Conference, it's been 1,200 days since we were elected. And Tony and I have got the bags under our eyes to prove it.</p> <p>But Gordon's got the bags in the bank! (Only joking Gordon.) And he's not been short of advice this week on how to spend it.</p> <p>Leadership. Now, there's a lot of talk in the party about leadership.</p> <p>Yes, leadership is easier when things are going your own way. But the true test of leadership is during the harder times when you have to make difficult decisions.</p> <p>Home and abroad, Tony doesn't shirk them. In Tony Blair we've got a leader who is right up there in the top rank. Respected here, in Europe and on the world stage.</p> <p>And a man who can lead us into a second term. And Tony, no deputy could have a better leader to help him.</p> <p>So whether an election comes in six months or 18 months, we must be ready, now. Ready to put our case. Ready to go to every part of the country. Ready to go to the cities and the towns, and yes - ready to go into the villages and countryside to put Labour's case.</p> <p>Like you, I just can't wait to get stuck into those Tories. Tories? Tories? This opposition? - what a lot of chancers!</p> <p>William Hague - he gives guarantees here, guarantees there - guarantees galore. But would you believe him?</p> <p>I'd sooner take a guarantee from Del Boy than William Hague. Come to think of it. I'd have more chance of getting a remit from Rodney than a genuine guarantee from Mr Hague.</p> <p>Still, happy retirement, Rodney. The platform wishes you well. But I'm sure you will be back. After all, people said Jack Jones and Barbara Castle were going to retire. And that was 20 years ago!</p> <p>One thing's for certain, Hague's' not retiring before the election. He's getting ready. Make no mistake.</p> <p>You know, he's had another one of his weird \"bonding sessions\" for the Tory shadow cabinet. All those old Val Doonican sweaters were out again.</p> <p>During the break they had to watch William \"Bruce Lee\" Hague doing his judo with Sebastian Coe. He's still learning. He's not got a black belt or a brown belt, yet. But he's just qualified for a green belt.</p> <p>Most Tories thought a \"green belt\" was just somewhere to build a supermarket - and make a few bob. Chop and change.</p> <p>The Tories are a joke, but they are a very dangerous joke. Because of what their policies and their promises mean for people.</p> <p>The Tories. They're a party which gave us the \"common sense revolution\". A fresh start to policy, they said. It lasted three months.</p> <p>They gave us a tax guarantee - that is, to cut taxes whatever the state of the economy. That lasted one month.</p> <p>They then launched their mini-manifesto, in the summer - that lasted one week.</p> <p>They were asked time and time again, would they cut the fuel tax?</p> <p>Hague told Jimmy Young : \"I don't think we should chop and change from week to week. It's not my job to ride around on every bandwagon.\"</p> <p>Six days later, there he was, promising a tax cut, shouting, \"any more room on that bandwagon? Got room for a little one?\"</p> <p>So there we have it. \"Fourteen pints\" Billy Fizz, drunk in charge of a bandwagon.</p> <p>We all knowm, you can never trust what the Tories say. I call them the Burger Kings of British politics - every minute another whopper!</p> <p>Cheap and nasty. Not only do their policies change every day, so do their slogans.</p> <p>In the summer they had \"compassionate Conservatism\". I couldn't believe my ears. Hague, Portillo, Widdecombe, Redwood - \"compassionate Conservatives\"?</p> <p>Think about it. It's a contradiction in terms. They only have to say it, because no one believes it in the first place. In my book, \"compassion\" means consideration, caring and concern.</p> <p>Did they show any compassion when they put 3m people on the dole?</p> <p>Did they show compassion when they stopped the free eye-tests for pensioners?</p> <p>Did they show compassion when they destroyed hundreds of mining communities?</p> <p>Did they show compassion when they left people homeless, sleeping rough on the streets?</p> <p>That's not compassionate conservatism. It's callous Conservatism.</p> <p>They haven't changed. They're worse than ever. Their trademark is pandering to fear and prejudice.</p> <p>The way they talk about asylum-seekers - many of them fleeing from the horrors of war and persecution.</p> <p>The way they behaved over section 28. Abolishing section 28 isn't just about tolerance and dignity. It's about children being protected from bullying.</p> <p>It was pandering to bigotry. That's what was so disgraceful about their behaviour.</p> <p>Their latest target is doctors from overseas. I tell you, when they insult doctors and health workers from overseas, it's an insult to all public servants. An affront to all of us who use and value our national health service.</p> <p>My family doctor's Asian. I've been with him for years. I'd like to thank him and all those who helped create and serve our great national health service - from whatever land they came.</p> <p>And who made this attack? Can you believe it - it was a doctor. Dr Liam Fox, the Tory health spokesman. Liam Fox. Now you know what I think about fox-hunting. But in his case, I'd make an exception.</p> <p>So never, ever trust these Tories. Every day we're reminded of it. What about Jeffery Archer? One minute he's courting the press, the next minute he's pressed into court.</p> <p>There he is, charged with telling lies. I thought to myself, why stop there? Why not charge the whole damn lot of them for the lies they have told?</p> <p>So I say to Jack Straw, there's a case for a class action! Politics of organisation and the politics of ideas. Talking about action, you know I've always believed that the politics of organisation is as important as the politics of ideas.</p> <p>We know we can't rely on all the ladies and gentlemen of the press to get across our message. They've got their own agenda. We've got ours. And the job of everyone in this party is to set our agenda, not to feed theirs.</p> <p>People want to hear about real policies. Not the tittle tattle of years ago. So, we've got to take our message directly to the people. Face to face, on the doorstep, in the shopping centre, on the bus.</p> <p>That's the way we've always done it. And that's the way we must do it today.</p> <p>To keep on building that trust with the people, to win the battle of ideas and to win that second term we've all worked so hard for.</p> <p>Membership - conference, in that battle, we need every person we can to join our fight. Our membership is the backbone of our organisation.</p> <p>Too many of us just got out of the habit of recruiting new members. We must ask people to join the fight, to stay with us, to get involved and work with us.</p> <p>Our MPs, party staff, ordinary members are gearing up for the campaign ahead.</p> <p>I'm proud that Labour MPs on the front and back benches are playing a great part. Honing the message and delivering the message.</p> <p>And on our 100th birthday, let's just pause to pay tribute to the thousands of ordinary everyday members of this party, who give so much to this party.</p> <p>This week during conference our organisers have been making 10,000 phone calls. The night of Tony's speech, the phones were red-hot with people wanting to join the party. I want them to be red-hot every day of the week.</p> <p>Only today, I joined up a new member - our newest recruit, Duncan Worthington. Take a bow! And it's his birthday today. He's 24 years old.</p> <p>He's an accountant. So he can help us work out the \u00a324m of Tory cuts in every constituency.</p> <p>Be confident. So I say to party members, be confident. Be proud. Walk tall.</p> <p>Get out there and tell people about what we have done. Tell them what we will do , with their support. Tell them what the Tories would do if they ever came back. And remember to ask people to join the party.</p> <p>Our solidarity is our strength. Operation turnout: every one of you was handed a leaflet like this today.</p> <p>It asks you to commit yourselves to help the party in campaigning. And to recruit a friend to the party.</p> <p>Well, I say to the people watching today - come and join us again. Rejoin the fight. Write to us. Come and join us. Because we've delivered, delivered, delivered.</p> <p>But the issue is turnout, turnout, turnout.</p> <p>Conference, everyone in this hall knows what is at stake. You know what we stand for. You know what we want to achieve. You know what we promised.</p> <p>Remember our pledge card? Here it is.</p> <p>We promised a quarter of a million places on the New Deal. And we are well on the way, with 230,000 young people in jobs to date. Real people in real jobs. Promise made, promise kept.</p> <p>We promised to cut NHS waiting lists by 100,000. And we have done. But we are doing something much bigger - rebuilding the NHS. It'll mean 20,000 extra nurses, 2,000 new doctors, real staff in real hospitals. Promise made, promise kept.</p> <p>We promised to reduce class sizes for five-to-seven-year-olds. We are doing that - were already a year ahead of schedule. Standards improving day by day. Promise made, promise kept.</p> <p>On crime, we promised fast track justice for young offenders; but we have also cut crime since the election. Promise made, promise kept.</p> <p>We promised a stable economy. But we did much more than that: we achieved something magnificent. Something people said was impossible. A million new jobs in the economy. Promise made, promise kept.</p> <p>Labour is delivering. So, we've got a simple message to tell. Labour has got the economy on a steady course; which meant taking some difficult decisions. Now we are investing in our public services - hospital, schools, police, transport.</p> <p>And what's the Tory alternative? I'll tell you - \u00a316bn of Tory spending cuts. \u00a324m of cuts in every constituency.</p> <p>So, when you get to Bournemouth next week, Mr Hague, come clean about the cuts. And to help you, today we are publishing a document which shows where these cuts will fall.</p> <p>We're giving copies to every delegate so you can go back to your constituency and prepare to splatter the Tories.</p> <p>So we will ask the \u00a324m question in every constituency in the country.</p> <p>I'll tell you what it means: 30 less doctors and 60 fewer nurses; 60 fewer police officers; a school axed in every single constituency; a hospital closed in every six local authorities; 760 nursery places; and free TV licences scrapped for over 4,000 pensioners.</p> <p>And that only gets you halfway to the \u00a324m cut in every constituency. You've seen this beer mat we produced in the summer. [produces beermat and pledge card]</p> <p>\"Tory froth\" or \"Labour delivery\". That's the choice facing Britain today. We'll go to the election posing that choice.</p> <p>Remember 18 years. The Tories will be at Bournemouth next week. We don't have to guess what they would do in government. We lived with it for 18 years. And we'll never let them forget what the Tories did to our country.</p> <p>Never forget the poll tax, 3m unemployed, the betrayal of our pensioners and the health service.</p> <p>Never forget the mad cow fiasco, the water bans, the privatisation fat cats. Never forget that 22 tax rises, inflation over 10%, mortgage rates of 15%. Negative equity and repossessions.</p> <p>Never forget cash for questions; Black Wednesday; the pit closures - the sheer injustice of those Tory years.</p> <p>Remember Mrs Thatcher in 1979, standing on the steps of No 10, saying: \"Where there is discord, may we bring harmony\"?</p> <p>The real truth is, where there was harmony, she brought discord. Where there was faith, she brought doubt. Where there was hope, she brought despair.</p> <p>We'll never ever forget, and we'll never ever forgive that betrayal.</p> <p>So I say to you all inside this hall, and the wider public beyond it - in our 100th year anniversary, we can be proud of what we've achieved.</p> <p>The 20th century saw many great advances in technology. The computer, the television, a man on the moon. Even the Jaguar motor car.</p> <p>But the greatest achievement of the Labour movement was to help shape the 20th century. To combat poverty, a welfare state. To combat squalor, social housing. To combat idleness, full employment. To combat ignorance, universal education. And at the heart of it all was the national health service - based on the socialist principle of treatment on the basis of need, not the ability to pay.</p> <p>Because we believe every person is of equal worth. We believe that we achieve more by the strength of our common endeavour than we achieve alone. We believe in opportunity for all, in a community where power, wealth and opportunity are in the hands of the many, not just the few.</p> <p>We civilised the 20th century with our democratic socialist values. Now our party is taking those values into the 21st century. Putting our traditional values in a modern setting. That's our crusade for social justice. Come and join us.</p> <p>So let's stand together, let's campaign together, let's work together. Together, build that better future for all.</p> <p>[After Gabrielle sings her hit Dreams to the conference, Mr Prescott introduces the former South African president Nelson Mandela.]</p> <p>I am about to welcome to conference a man who - with his courage, his strength, his charity, his dignity, his statesmanship and his humanity has won the hearts of the world.</p> <p>You know, we spent 18 years in opposition and we hated it.</p> <p>He spent 27 years in prison and he never for one second gave up faith or hope.</p> <p>Tony spoke of his irreducible core. Well this an certainly has an irreducible core.</p> <p>So it is my pleasure now to welcome the prime minister [Tony Blair] and the man the world wanted to free - Nelson Mandela.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/labour2000/story/0,7369,374727,00.html\">Full text of Nelson Mandela's speech</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0928mandela.ra\">Audio: hear Nelson Mandela's speech (29mins 43)</a></p>",

So, we've got to take our message directly to the people. Face to face, on the doorstep, in the shopping centre, on the bus. That's the way we've always done it. And that's the way we must do it today. To keep on building that trust with the people, to win the battle of ideas and to win that second term we've all worked so hard for. Membership - conference, in that battle, we need every person we can to join our fight. Our membership is the backbone of our organisation. Too many of us just got out of the habit of recruiting new members. We must ask people to join the fight, to stay with us, to get involved and work with us. Our MPs, party staff, ordinary members are gearing up for the campaign ahead. I'm proud that Labour MPs on the front and back benches are playing a great part. Honing the message and delivering the message. And on our 100th birthday, let's just pause to pay tribute to the thousands of ordinary everyday members of this party, who give so much to this party. This week during conference our organisers have been making 10,000 phone calls. The night of Tony's speech, the phones were red-hot with people wanting to join the party. I want them to be red-hot every day of the week. Only today, I joined up a new member - our newest recruit, Duncan Worthington. Take a bow! And it's his birthday today. He's 24 years old. He's an accountant. So he can help us work out the \u00a324m of Tory cuts in every constituency. Be confident. So I say to party members, be confident. Be proud. Walk tall. Get out there and tell people about what we have done. Tell them what we will do , with their support. Tell them what the Tories would do if they ever came back. And remember to ask people to join the party. Our solidarity is our strength. Operation turnout: every one of you was handed a leaflet like this today. It asks you to commit yourselves to help the party in campaigning. And to recruit a friend to the party. Well, I say to the people watching today - come and join us again. Rejoin the fight. Write to us. Come and join us. Because we've delivered, delivered, delivered. But the issue is turnout, turnout, turnout. Conference, everyone in this hall knows what is at stake. You know what we stand for. You know what we want to achieve. You know what we promised. Remember our pledge card? Here it is. We promised a quarter of a million places on the New Deal. And we are well on the way, with 230,000 young people in jobs to date. Real people in real jobs. Promise made, promise kept. We promised to cut NHS waiting lists by 100,000. And we have done. But we are doing something much bigger - rebuilding the NHS. It'll mean 20,000 extra nurses, 2,000 new doctors, real staff in real hospitals. Promise made, promise kept. We promised to reduce class sizes for five-to-seven-year-olds. We are doing that - were already a year ahead of schedule. Standards improving day by day. Promise made, promise kept. On crime, we promised fast track justice for young offenders; but we have also cut crime since the election. Promise made, promise kept. We promised a stable economy. But we did much more than that: we achieved something magnificent. Something people said was impossible. A million new jobs in the economy. Promise made, promise kept. Labour is delivering. So, we've got a simple message to tell. Labour has got the economy on a steady course; which meant taking some difficult decisions. Now we are investing in our public services - hospital, schools, police, transport. And what's the Tory alternative? I'll tell you - \u00a316bn of Tory spending cuts. \u00a324m of cuts in every constituency. So, when you get to Bournemouth next week, Mr Hague, come clean about the cuts. And to help you, today we are publishing a document which shows where these cuts will fall. We're giving copies to every delegate so you can go back to your constituency and prepare to splatter the Tories. So we will ask the \u00a324m question in every constituency in the country. I'll tell you what it means: 30 less doctors and 60 fewer nurses; 60 fewer police officers; a school axed in every single constituency; a hospital closed in every six local authorities; 760 nursery places; and free TV licences scrapped for over 4,000 pensioners. And that only gets you halfway to the \u00a324m cut in every constituency. You've seen this beer mat we produced in the summer. [produces beermat and pledge card] \"Tory froth\" or \"Labour delivery\". That's the choice facing Britain today. We'll go to the election posing that choice. Remember 18 years. The Tories will be at Bournemouth next week. We don't have to guess what they would do in government. We lived with it for 18 years. And we'll never let them forget what the Tories did to our country. Never forget the poll tax, 3m unemployed, the betrayal of our pensioners and the health service. Never forget the mad cow fiasco, the water bans, the privatisation fat cats. Never forget that 22 tax rises, inflation over 10%, mortgage rates of 15%. Negative equity and repossessions. Never forget cash for questions; Black Wednesday; the pit closures - the sheer injustice of those Tory years. Remember Mrs Thatcher in 1979, standing on the steps of No 10, saying: \"Where there is discord, may we bring harmony\"? The real truth is, where there was harmony, she brought discord. Where there was faith, she brought doubt. Where there was hope, she brought despair. We'll never ever forget, and we'll never ever forgive that betrayal. So I say to you all inside this hall, and the wider public beyond it - in our 100th year anniversary, we can be proud of what we've achieved. The 20th century saw many great advances in technology. The computer, the television, a man on the moon. Even the Jaguar motor car. But the greatest achievement of the Labour movement was to help shape the 20th century. To combat poverty, a welfare state. To combat squalor, social housing. To combat idleness, full employment. To combat ignorance, universal education. And at the heart of it all was the national health service - based on the socialist principle of treatment on the basis of need, not the ability to pay. Because we believe every person is of equal worth. We believe that we achieve more by the strength of our common endeavour than we achieve alone. We believe in opportunity for all, in a community where power, wealth and opportunity are in the hands of the many, not just the few. We civilised the 20th century with our democratic socialist values. Now our party is taking those values into the 21st century. Putting our traditional values in a modern setting. That's our crusade for social justice. Come and join us. So let's stand together, let's campaign together, let's work together. Together, build that better future for all. [After Gabrielle sings her hit Dreams to the conference, Mr Prescott introduces the former South African president Nelson Mandela.] I am about to welcome to conference a man who - with his courage, his strength, his charity, his dignity, his statesmanship and his humanity has won the hearts of the world. You know, we spent 18 years in opposition and we hated it. He spent 27 years in prison and he never for one second gave up faith or hope. Tony spoke of his irreducible core. Well this an certainly has an irreducible core. So it is my pleasure now to welcome the prime minister [Tony Blair] and the man the world wanted to free - Nelson Mandela.

Apartheid was experienced as such a basic onslaught against human dignity that it demeaned all of us. The political parties in the major western countries often had different approaches in their support for the freedom struggle in South Africa, but none could ever condone the racism of apartheid. This universal abhorrence of apartheid contributed significantly to the ultimate victory of freedom, non-racialism and democracy in our country. One therefore has an appreciation for the support received from people all over the world, irrespective of their party political affiliation. There were however, political parties and organisations in the western democracies with which the liberation movement developed particularly strong solidarity relations. These derived from a common approach to such social issues as poverty and the primary concern for the marginalised. These relationships were built and consolidated in joint action and struggle with the solidarity forces in those countries. The Labour party of Great Britain is one such organisation. It therefore gives us such great pleasure to join with you here today at your party congress in the year that the party celebrates its centenary. Allow me in the first place to extend our hearty congratulations to the Labour party. I am certain that I can do so on behalf of all the freedom-loving people in our country, who appreciated the extent to which the attainment of democracy in South Africa was also due to our solidarity partners internationally. I know that I can do it on behalf of the organisation that you supported so faithfully over many decades, the African National Congress. Britain was in so many respects the second headquarters of our movement in exile. Your solidarity helped to make those years of exile bearable and contributed to them not turning out to be wasted years. With you we can look back to the proud beginnings of your organisation, rooted in the concern to give organisational voice to those without power. To have sustained over a century such an organisation is a tribute not only to the Labour party, its leadership and members. It is testimony to the resilience of the spirit that continues to believe that the world can be made a better place for all. It defies and gives the lie to the pervasive cynicism and loss of hope that characterised so much of political life in the latter part of the last century. The centenary celebrations of such a political organisation serves to remind us, here at the start of a new millennium, of the continued need to persevere in the pursuit of those ideals. The internationalism of which the Labour party was such a potent part, as we well know in South Africa, today faces new challenges. At a time international solidarity was a triumph of the human spirit over the barriers of distance and isolation. We marvelled at that generosity of spirit capable of reaching out to take part in the struggles of those far removed and in distant corners of the world. Today the world has become the global village of which we once spoke only in wishful metaphor. What happens in one part of the globe is immediately accessible to the entire world and affects others over great distances. The danger is that globalisation can come to mean only the free flow of goods and finance, the open access to markets, the breaking down of barriers to trade and commerce. The concern for the common good, which characterised the international solidarity we spoke of , is in danger of being lost in the current understanding of a global world. We would argue that the shrinking of the globe through the advances in communications and information technology has made it even more incumbent upon us to become once more the keepers of our brothers and sisters no matter where they find themselves in the world. This may very well be one of the major political and moral tasks of the Labour party in the 21st century. One can have these global expectations only of a party that domestically holds dear those values of solidarity with the poor and the vulnerable sectors of society.

Our historic relationship with the Labour party rests upon our common concern to centrally represent the voice and interests of those sectors traditionally excluded from power and privilege. In our own country poverty remains the greatest social problem and its eradication our greatest political and societal challenge. We have achieved a non-racial democracy based on one of the most progressive constitutions anywhere in the world. Our once divided society has come together in an act of national reconciliation that ensures that our political order is stable; we now live out our differences within the framework of our constitutional democracy. The management of our economy is widely acclaimed for the manner in which sound macro-economic fundamentals are maintained. The people-centred growth of our economy, with new jobs and increasing prosperity for all our people, has however not occurred at the pace and volume we hoped for when we set out on this road of reconstruction and development. The growth of an economy is no longer merely a national matter. Globalisation has exactly meant that a nation's best made plans can go awry due to international factors beyond its control. We have seen that with the financial crisis in the Asian markets, even though our economy withstood that crisis better than most of the emergent economies. The effective growth of an economy like ours is crucially dependent upon direct foreign investment; yet one often witnesses how the political stability, social progressiveness and sound economic management in the country are ignored when investment decisions are made. As we stood together to oppose apartheid in South Africa, we are today called upon to join forces for growth and development. Democratic South Africa has no pretensions to being a mini superpower in our region, on our continent or in the developing world. We do, however, realise that we have a responsibility to articulate common concerns of those regions when we do act on the international stage. In doing so, we turn once more to our traditional solidarity partners, like the Labour party, to add their voice to those clamouring and working for a better and more equitable life for all throughout the world. We wish you well as you enter the second century of your organisational life.

Specifically, he was faced with the question of whether to grant clemency to the first woman in modern Texas history to face execution, having exhausted all appeals. The Review thought that 'of course' the case has 'mostly to do with women'. Tucker's would be the first execution of a woman in Texas since the Civil War, it reported, and a rarity for the country (less than 0.5 per cent of the nearly eight thousand people executed in the US in the 20th century were women). Crimes by women are less horrible than crimes committed by men, except for some - like murdering children - which are more so, the Review continued. An even bigger source of embarrassment was that Tucker had found Jesus. She captured the attention and support of the normally pro-capital punishment evangelical Right: she was 'a woman of such obvious spiritual change', according to an official of the National Association of Evangelicals, that she deserved special consideration. Fifteen years earlier, high on a cocktail of drugs, she pickaxed two people to death. She was living a life of prostitution and violence: a decade and a half later she was someone quite different. </p> <p>At her trial Tucker confessed that she had had an orgasm with each of the 20 thrusts of her pick into one victim; she finished by embedding it in the chest of a sleeping girl. That was then. Now she was born again; she was married to the prison chaplain; she was beautiful but not too sensuous, full-lipped, well-spoken and known to the American public from a chiaroscuro photograph in which her hands are raised as if to shield her from the blinding glory of the Holy Spirit. (The pose is from an Annunciation scene. Death Row, a sort of capital punishment fanzine, reprints a small version of the picture.) The Pope pleaded her case, though this is not unusual - the Church has been a consistent opponent of capital punishment in the US since its revival. But so did Pat Robertson, one of its most vociferous religious proponents. (He did not speak out, as far as I know, for Clifford Burgess, who converted to Catholicism and developed what was apparently a remarkable talent for painting during his 12 years on Death Row.) In Tucker's case, however, he proclaimed that executing her would be 'more an act of vengeance than it is appropriate justice'.</p> <p>Really? Vengeance, one would have thought, is always the point, because if rehabilitation - or remorse and redemption - were at issue many more would escape death during the long course of their appeals. (Bush didn't stop Tucker's execution.) Tony Amadeo murdered an old man in the course of a petty larceny in 1977: remorse and intense guilt came quickly; a model prisoner throughout his appeals he spends the life sentence he was given at his retrial in 1997 reading - lately Defoe, Dickens and Balzac. But after a decade and often more, even less gifted murderers are not the same people as they were when they committed their crimes. Retribution so long delayed inevitably loses much of its attraction.</p> <p>The cry therefore goes out to speed things up. A new term has entered the discussion, an impatient harrumph, a call for 'closure'. The term once referred to fields and meadows, mathematical sets or zippers; it was taken up as a term of art in literary theory and recently migrated to business and pop psychology. Deals were brought to closure and so were messy divorces and unhappy love affairs. And now so are the lives of criminals, but with a curious displacement. 'Execution is closure,' the Sacramento Bee announced in a recent headline. The thirst for vengeance, admitted Billy Smith, after watching the execution in Virginia by lethal injection of the man who had murdered his father in the course of robbing his jewellery store, had 'ultimately evolved into a yearning for closure'. Waiting had been 'almost like reading a novel and getting to the ending and that last page torn out', he thought. But 'closure' when it came was not as satisfying as he had anticipated. Yes, it ended a long chapter in his life but it was, he said, 'really anti-climactic'; he was struck by 'how unemotional it was, how antiseptic, even medicinal... Electrocution probably would have been more... dramatic, maybe.'</p> <p>One can sympathise with the victims of crime, or rather their relatives, wanting the punishment to be 'swift and sure'. Of course, swifter 'closure' could be achieved through a mandatory life sentence or a programme of reparations or in any number of other ways. The US has, however, adopted one particular d\u00e9nouement - an actual death - and in the modern world this turns out to be difficult to bring off with the desired dramatic effect.</p> <p>This, too, is a consequence of the Furman decision: the elaboration of the notion that capital punishment exists to avenge the blood of the victim in the name of the victim's relatives and friends. Outraged community still matters but much less: the 'real victims' are those left to mourn. One cannot blame this on Supreme Court jurisprudence alone. Americans have, of late, characterised much of their social world in the rhetoric of victimhood and both sides in capital cases have come under its spell. The adversarial system, by its nature, creates intimate personal narratives, this story versus that story. Accounts of crime have always included anecdotes of the criminal's misspent youth and first deviation from the strait and narrow, but the requirement that one side present 'aggravating circumstances', and the other side 'mitigating circumstances' has created a discourse of the death penalty that reads remarkably like a tabloid tearjerker. </p> <p>Lawyers cannot be blamed for this. Bright sees his job as convincing a jury that his client is more than his worst moment: that he was once fully human and is now again fully human even if for some moments in between he was evil. He deserves to live. Bright thus calls to the witness stand a minister who counselled William Brooks in jail; he calls Brooks's sister, who speaks of the beatings he received as a child and the domestic chaos in their home. The prosecutor may make a mistake with respect to the black members of the jury, McFeely suggests, by pouring scorn on this young black women who has escaped the horrors at home and 'was busy graduating from high school and didn't even pay attention' to her brother's troubles. The accused's mother also testifies. </p> <p>On the other side sit the fianc\u00e9 and the mother of the young woman who was raped and murdered. Their pain and loss are made evident. Because 'heinous, depraved and cruel' are terms of art - aggravating factors - the girl's family and the jurors see again forensic photographs of the stabbed body; they hear details of the fatal wounds. The prosecutor re-creates the whole nightmarish scene and suggests that the murder of this beautiful girl, which has caused the family much pain, be matched by the death of the man who robbed her, and them, of her young life. The defence retorts by acknowledging the crime's full horror and insisting on the humanity of the killer and on alternatives to killing him. </p> <p>As a consequence of this procedure all sorts of biographical detail about murderers emerges and further clouds the symbolic clarity of killing them quickly and without their attaining any human depth. Mitigation, for example, might include the fact that the murderer was so mentally retarded that he didn't understand what he had done or what might become of him. Some states, including Georgia, no longer execute those below a specified IQ. But others still do and questions about the rightness of capital punishment generally, or of specific instances, are displaced by discussions as to whether the condemned man is as stupid as some tests suggest, even if stupidity is not legally a mitigating circumstance.</p> <p>I watched the national coverage of the most recent Texas execution. (In fact, there were two that night but only one caught the media's eye.) Attention focused on the state spokesperson, who suggested that the condemned man really had an IQ even higher than had been suggested on appeal - 81, very slow - and on the defence spokespeople, who said that his IQ was really either 68 or 72 as two previous tests had shown. (These scores would meet many states' criteria for retardation.) No one disputed that he had failed seventh grade three times, an unprecedented feat in American middle school, and couldn't read. In all, almost forty mental incompetents have been executed since 1976; the man whose warrant Bill Clinton rushed home to sign in 1992 when he was running for President was probably so far gone - as a result of a lobotomy - that he didn't know what was happening to him. In general, the denizens of Death Row who make it to the execution chamber are revealed in the course of their appeals, if not at their trials, to be a pretty pathetic lot.</p> <p>There has also been a displacement from justice as a matter of public policy to justice as what it was long ago, a private matter. This, too, has muddied the waters. Because the trial is construed so personally, as victim against perpetrator, the death penalty has come to seem like a way of satisfying the injured party rather than the State. It's as if the courts had become the agent of one side in a blood feud while lacking the freedom to take swift action that made personal justice work in Norse law. </p> <p>If one accepts the notion that executions exist at least in part to give satisfaction to family and friends, the problem arises of what to do when the victim's family opposes capital punishment: pleas from a slain state trooper's children had no effect in a recent Virginia case. Or what to do when the family is divided, as in the case of a former Buddhist monk who murdered a woman in California. The victim's son wanted vengeance. Her husband, on the other hand, asked for mercy in keeping with his religion - he, too, was a Buddhist. (The killer was executed.) And what if no one cares one way or the other? Neither the victim's family nor his own family witnessed the death, after 23 years on Death Row, of Sammie Felder Jr, the fourth person executed in December 1999, and Texas's last of the 20th century. Even the number of protesters was tiny on that chilly winter's evening and no one was there to cheer either. </p> <p>As personal stories are elaborated, people take sides. Last year, California executed Manny Babbitt, a decorated Vietnam War veteran who served as a marine at the 70- day siege of Khe Sahn. He indisputably suffered from post-traumatic shock, claiming to remember nothing of the day of his crime, when a 'flash of light' sent him over the edge. Supporting his petition for clemency were veterans' organisations ('the execution is just another cold shoulder to Vietnam veterans'); several prominent writers who were also Vietnam veterans; his fifth-grade teacher who had come to California to plead his case ('I told him I was honoured to be his teacher'); two of the jurors who had originally convicted him, who said that if they had known the details of his life they would not have voted for the death penalty; and a retired Detroit police officer whose life he had saved at Khe Sahn. On the other side, opposing clemency, was the victim's family.</p> <p>California's new Governor, Gray Davis, a Democrat, worried about appearing soft on crime, turned down the request for a life sentence without parole for Babbitt on the grounds that the trauma he had suffered during his childhood and military service was not sufficient to spare his life. How much trauma, one might ask, would justify commuting death to a lifetime of imprisonment? Claims for clemency have always been made by citing mitigating circumstances, but what used to be understood as the interests of the State have now been reduced to claims and counter-claims of trauma. Whether or not someone on Death Row can be made to count as human because he, too, has been injured is an odd jurisprudential twist.</p> <p>Or again, perhaps not. This is a country where supporters of the death penalty proudly proclaim that it is 'the American punishment' and the father of one victim told the press that 'out here in the country, we're hunters and we know how to treat animals.' It had taken 22 years finally to execute his daughter's killer, he lamented, and he 'wouldn't miss it for the world'.</p> <p>There have been two sorts of response to the post-Furman revolution that seeks to make capital punishment rational and equitable. One is that of the Supreme Court Justice Harry Blackmun, a lifelong supporter of the death penalty who finally, in a 1994 case, gave up. He declared that he would 'no longer tinker with the machinery of death'. The State's decision whether to take a life was 'so inherently subjective - rife with all of life's understandings, experiences, prejudices and passions - that it inevitably defies the rationality required by the Constitution'. The other response is, procedures be damned. </p> <p>No court or legislature has quite said as much, although the Supreme Court has made no secret of its distaste for long-drawn-out appeals. It has severely restricted access to Federal courts by curtailing the use of habeas corpus and by limiting appeals in other ways. Meanwhile, Congress has cut funds to pay appellate lawyers who represent the indigent, i.e. almost all those on Death Row. (The Southern Center for Human Rights and comparable groups are privately funded.) State courts are increasingly hesitant to grant appeals; some of them, like Texas's, routinely turn a blind eye to even the most egregious irregularities. </p> <p>It is in the context of this judicial effort to speed up the process that last year's series of stories in the Chicago Tribune were such a bombshell. They have probably done more than any intervention of the past two decades to shift the debate by showing not only that the system works irrationally and unfairly - this is not big news - but also that innocent people are likely to be executed as a consequence. How many is difficult to say. The most thorough research we have suggests 23 for sure since 1900, and over four hundred more cases in which there is serious doubt. We know that at least three of those on Death Row in Florida whose sentences were commuted after Furman turned out to be innocent, but we don't know whether they would have been executed had their cases not been short-circuited. But Ken Armstrong and Steve Mills, the Tribune reporters, made it absolutely clear that there were at least 12 innocent men on Death Row in Illinois and that only chance discoveries - some coming to light after all judicial appeals had been exhausted, all the result of efforts by privately supported appellate attorneys or, most strikingly, by the students of a Northwestern University journalism class - saved these men from execution. (A 13th case came to light earlier this year.) </p> <p>In the old regime none of this would have mattered much. William Paley, the great late 18th-century theologian, regretted that some innocent men might be hanged but did not find it fundamentally problematic. These unfortunates, he thought, should regard themselves as giving their lives for their country - as sacrifices to the moral and legal order. Today this won't do, at least not officially. Punishment is meant to be individual, rational and proportionate. (Popularly, such niceties may have little purchase. Pro-death penalty demonstrators outside San Quentin last year waved towards the prison and told the press that half the men 'in there' deserved to die.) </p> <p>The general conclusion of the Chicago Tribune series was that capital punishment in Illinois is a mess, even though the Illinois Supreme Court is far from a rubber stamp for lower court decisions. In Texas, as Armstrong, Mills and another colleague, Doug Holt, have shown in two follow-up articles, the majority on the final Appeals Court is ideologically committed to carrying out as many death sentences as possible, as quickly as possible. These reporters are not naive. They have no illusions about some of the men whose cases they investigate. (One man is guilty of murder, just not of the murder for which he was convicted.) What they discovered is that the whole process, from initial investigation through trial and appeals is so riven with error that the status of the process itself, and thus of individual cases, is called into question. </p> <p>In 46 out of the Tribune investigators' 285 cases the prosecution used notoriously unreliable jailhouse informants whose sentences were reduced in exchange for their testimony. In one case, the evidence came from a man who had been labelled a pathological liar by Federal authorities: his veracity was vouchsafed at trial by his candid admission of having lied previously. In 20 instances the death sentence was based in large part on a visual comparison of hair colour, a famously unreliable method left over from the late 19th century and now banned in many jurisdictions. Thirteen innocent men in Illinois have been freed from this morass; how many more there are is not known. One of the Justices of the Illinois Supreme Court had already written two years earlier that he would no longer vote to uphold the death penalty because 'so many mistakes' had been made. The Republican Governor has suspended executions; the Republican Governor of Texas, on the other hand, George W. Bush, has expressed faith in the system. Nietzsche got it right: To see others suffer does one good. To make others suffer even more: this is a hard [saying] but an ancient, mighty human, all too human principle, to which even the apes might subscribe... without cruelty there is no festival: thus the longest and most ancient part of human history teaches... and in punishment there is festival. Certainly, in punishment there is pleasure if, regrettably to some, not as much as there once was. In the old days, the owner of a bar in California told a reporter covering an execution, 'we used to hang people from a brick building across the street... [now] we'll just have to have our own execution party by remote control.' She predicted dancing in the streets. A long, high cultural tradition is drawn to murder and to execution, if increasingly from a safe literary distance. (See Wendy Lesser's Pictures at an Execution.) And the conjunction between mass entertainment and death goes back to the very beginning. </p> <p>One of the earliest commercial films ever made shows the electrocution of an elephant in the Coney Island amusement park, a spectacle brought to viewers by Thomas Edison, whose lab developed the electric chair. And Death Row brings the old forms of the penny dreadful, the murder feuilleton, The Newgate Calendar and the amusement park together in a modern form. It is a rogues' gallery of unsavoury-looking characters: everyone awaiting execution in the United States today is represented by a picture and a paragraph describing their crimes in gory detail. (One is relieved that some of them are behind bars.) Longer articles feature special criminals. And there is a jolly mix of commentary about victims vindicated, liberals and lawyers stymied, rough justice triumphant. Last words are recorded, as are last meals: hamburgers and coke are the most popular. Of late, Texas has been offering a <a href=\"http://www.tdcj.state.tx.us/stat/finalmeals.htm\">website</a> where those interested can get up-to-the-minute information on specific cases and general policy. No BLTs, for example, because the state does not serve convicts bacon - too expensive. Likewise, those who request T-bone steak get Salisbury steak instead. And so on in edifying detail.</p> <p>There are also modern twists to old themes: in place of the bits of clothing or other souvenirs a crowd could gather in the old days, today's fans can buy replicas of six different electric chairs replete with wrist and ankle restraints and fake flashes of current. (This July, the New York Times ran a small story about a new plaything from McFarland Toys: a model of Death Row Marv, anti-hero of Frank Miller's Sin City, who is strapped to an electric chair and taunts his persecutors with a jeering 'is that the best you can do?' when the switch is thrown. His 'eyes light up as he fries'. Recommended for children of 13 and up; it costs $20.)</p> <p>Even the old pleasures are not what they once were, however. Execution seems just a little embarrassing, a private pleasure to be shared with the like-minded but not something that would survive in broad daylight. Death Row somewhat sheepishly gives over a page of its website to someone whom an earlier edition regarded as guilty but who the editor now thinks is innocent. 'Old Sparky', the electric chair built by prison inmates in Florida, was retired after almost sixty years. Its replacement failed to pass Constitutional muster when the Florida Supreme Court saw videos of what the judges said was the ghastly execution of someone too fat properly to conduct electricity. In fact, from the very beginning in Edison's lab it has not been easy, for all sorts of technical reasons, reliably to kill someone with electricity. A special session of the Florida legislature, following a national trend, opted for lethal injection late last year. </p> <p>Public executions, at which large crowds could actually watch justice being done succumbed to bourgeois sensibilities long ago, during the 19th or early 20th centuries. (The last one - excepting lynchings - in the United States brought a huge festive crowd to the foot of the gallows in Kentucky in the 1930s.) Today we kill at night - over 80 per cent of executions are carried out between 11 p.m. and 7 in the morning (half between midnight and 1 a.m.). Courts have resisted televised executions on all manner of spurious grounds - among them, security problems and safeguarding the identity of those who carry out the procedure. The real reason is that public or pay-per-view executions would be indecent and offensive to 'modern sensibilities'. The few tapes of actual executions, presented as evidence in cases arguing that electrocution and gassing constituted cruel punishment, have not been leaked. The bottom line of capital punishment - the killing itself - has, in short, become almost secret and certainly not something to be enjoyed openly.</p> <p>Some prisons have, of late, made provision for victims' families to witness executions. But there is something half-hearted even here. They are not allowed to see the needle being inserted: because medical ethics prohibit doctors and nurses from carrying out executions, the job falls to paramedics, who are not very experienced and often screw up. Thus the curtain is opened only when everything is in order - condemned strapped to the cross-like gurney, tubes in place - and it is quickly closed again if, as happens in about 10 per cent of cases, something goes wrong. It's a far cry from Hogarth's Idle Apprentice. The victim's friends and family are tidily segregated on one side of the glass-enclosed room, friends of the accused on the other, like friends of the bride and friends of the groom each in their own pews. The scene played out before them looks like the events in an operating theatre, familiar to American viewers from surgery shows on 24-hour cable. Even so, it's strong stuff. In Texas a special Huntsville Regional Post Trauma Unit is on call in the support room to 'prepare victim witnesses and personalise the event', as well as to help them deal with such upsetting contingencies as 'the inmate's last breath sounding like a rattle or snort', his eyes remaining open, or a last statement that is vengeful or lacking remorse.</p> <p>Today, even old-fashioned supporters of capital punishment are too high-minded to allow full expression of the old pleasures. 'Retribution,' the one-time Solicitor General Robert Bork argued before the Supreme Court, 'is itself an important, perhaps a vital, social function.' But retribution must be 'stripped of its vindictiveness'. What sort of retribution, I wonder, is not intended to cause anguish or hurt? What satisfaction could there be in it? Modern sensibilities, secularism and the rule of law - not to speak of a tainted history - have robbed capital punishment of almost all its symbolic powers.</p> <p>Yet there is still something awesome about an execution, perhaps all the more an execution carried out in the bowels of a great institution at dead of night, before a small audience - or none at all - by executioners who in another setting would be doctors and nurses. It has been awesome since Neolithic times, when our ancestors sacrificed humans to assure fertility and through all the festivities of antiquity and the Ancien R\u00e9gime it has remained so. Some people in this country can imagine a secure moral order only if it is somehow underwritten by these exercises in death. Most people would want, on first impulse, to cause as much pain as possible to those who cause pain to their loved ones. </p> <p>It is the work of civilisation to mitigate such impulses, to acknowledge that this sort of sacrificial violence is no longer necessary to sustain the social compact. We no longer live in the supposedly unified communities of old. Human sacrifice is not what keeps a pluralistic society together and it is time that some American politician said as much.</p>",

Her husband, on the other hand, asked for mercy in keeping with his religion - he, too, was a Buddhist. (The killer was executed.) And what if no one cares one way or the other? Neither the victim's family nor his own family witnessed the death, after 23 years on Death Row, of Sammie Felder Jr, the fourth person executed in December 1999, and Texas's last of the 20th century. Even the number of protesters was tiny on that chilly winter's evening and no one was there to cheer either. As personal stories are elaborated, people take sides. Last year, California executed Manny Babbitt, a decorated Vietnam War veteran who served as a marine at the 70- day siege of Khe Sahn. He indisputably suffered from post-traumatic shock, claiming to remember nothing of the day of his crime, when a 'flash of light' sent him over the edge. Supporting his petition for clemency were veterans' organisations ('the execution is just another cold shoulder to Vietnam veterans'); several prominent writers who were also Vietnam veterans; his fifth-grade teacher who had come to California to plead his case ('I told him I was honoured to be his teacher'); two of the jurors who had originally convicted him, who said that if they had known the details of his life they would not have voted for the death penalty; and a retired Detroit police officer whose life he had saved at Khe Sahn. On the other side, opposing clemency, was the victim's family. California's new Governor, Gray Davis, a Democrat, worried about appearing soft on crime, turned down the request for a life sentence without parole for Babbitt on the grounds that the trauma he had suffered during his childhood and military service was not sufficient to spare his life. How much trauma, one might ask, would justify commuting death to a lifetime of imprisonment? Claims for clemency have always been made by citing mitigating circumstances, but what used to be understood as the interests of the State have now been reduced to claims and counter-claims of trauma. Whether or not someone on Death Row can be made to count as human because he, too, has been injured is an odd jurisprudential twist. Or again, perhaps not. This is a country where supporters of the death penalty proudly proclaim that it is 'the American punishment' and the father of one victim told the press that 'out here in the country, we're hunters and we know how to treat animals.' It had taken 22 years finally to execute his daughter's killer, he lamented, and he 'wouldn't miss it for the world'. There have been two sorts of response to the post-Furman revolution that seeks to make capital punishment rational and equitable. One is that of the Supreme Court Justice Harry Blackmun, a lifelong supporter of the death penalty who finally, in a 1994 case, gave up. He declared that he would 'no longer tinker with the machinery of death'. The State's decision whether to take a life was 'so inherently subjective - rife with all of life's understandings, experiences, prejudices and passions - that it inevitably defies the rationality required by the Constitution'. The other response is, procedures be damned. No court or legislature has quite said as much, although the Supreme Court has made no secret of its distaste for long-drawn-out appeals. It has severely restricted access to Federal courts by curtailing the use of habeas corpus and by limiting appeals in other ways. Meanwhile, Congress has cut funds to pay appellate lawyers who represent the indigent, i.e. almost all those on Death Row. (The Southern Center for Human Rights and comparable groups are privately funded.) State courts are increasingly hesitant to grant appeals; some of them, like Texas's, routinely turn a blind eye to even the most egregious irregularities. It is in the context of this judicial effort to speed up the process that last year's series of stories in the Chicago Tribune were such a bombshell. They have probably done more than any intervention of the past two decades to shift the debate by showing not only that the system works irrationally and unfairly - this is not big news - but also that innocent people are likely to be executed as a consequence. How many is difficult to say. The most thorough research we have suggests 23 for sure since 1900, and over four hundred more cases in which there is serious doubt. We know that at least three of those on Death Row in Florida whose sentences were commuted after Furman turned out to be innocent, but we don't know whether they would have been executed had their cases not been short-circuited. But Ken Armstrong and Steve Mills, the Tribune reporters, made it absolutely clear that there were at least 12 innocent men on Death Row in Illinois and that only chance discoveries - some coming to light after all judicial appeals had been exhausted, all the result of efforts by privately supported appellate attorneys or, most strikingly, by the students of a Northwestern University journalism class - saved these men from execution. (A 13th case came to light earlier this year.) In the old regime none of this would have mattered much. William Paley, the great late 18th-century theologian, regretted that some innocent men might be hanged but did not find it fundamentally problematic. These unfortunates, he thought, should regard themselves as giving their lives for their country - as sacrifices to the moral and legal order. Today this won't do, at least not officially. Punishment is meant to be individual, rational and proportionate. (Popularly, such niceties may have little purchase. Pro-death penalty demonstrators outside San Quentin last year waved towards the prison and told the press that half the men 'in there' deserved to die.) The general conclusion of the Chicago Tribune series was that capital punishment in Illinois is a mess, even though the Illinois Supreme Court is far from a rubber stamp for lower court decisions. In Texas, as Armstrong, Mills and another colleague, Doug Holt, have shown in two follow-up articles, the majority on the final Appeals Court is ideologically committed to carrying out as many death sentences as possible, as quickly as possible. These reporters are not naive. They have no illusions about some of the men whose cases they investigate. (One man is guilty of murder, just not of the murder for which he was convicted.) What they discovered is that the whole process, from initial investigation through trial and appeals is so riven with error that the status of the process itself, and thus of individual cases, is called into question. In 46 out of the Tribune investigators' 285 cases the prosecution used notoriously unreliable jailhouse informants whose sentences were reduced in exchange for their testimony. In one case, the evidence came from a man who had been labelled a pathological liar by Federal authorities: his veracity was vouchsafed at trial by his candid admission of having lied previously. In 20 instances the death sentence was based in large part on a visual comparison of hair colour, a famously unreliable method left over from the late 19th century and now banned in many jurisdictions. Thirteen innocent men in Illinois have been freed from this morass; how many more there are is not known. One of the Justices of the Illinois Supreme Court had already written two years earlier that he would no longer vote to uphold the death penalty because 'so many mistakes' had been made. The Republican Governor has suspended executions; the Republican Governor of Texas, on the other hand, George W. Bush, has expressed faith in the system. Nietzsche got it right: To see others suffer does one good. To make others suffer even more: this is a hard [saying] but an ancient, mighty human, all too human principle, to which even the apes might subscribe... without cruelty there is no festival: thus the longest and most ancient part of human history teaches... and in punishment there is festival. Certainly, in punishment there is pleasure if, regrettably to some, not as much as there once was. In the old days, the owner of a bar in California told a reporter covering an execution, 'we used to hang people from a brick building across the street... [now] we'll just have to have our own execution party by remote control.' She predicted dancing in the streets. A long, high cultural tradition is drawn to murder and to execution, if increasingly from a safe literary distance. (See Wendy Lesser's Pictures at an Execution.) And the conjunction between mass entertainment and death goes back to the very beginning. One of the earliest commercial films ever made shows the electrocution of an elephant in the Coney Island amusement park, a spectacle brought to viewers by Thomas Edison, whose lab developed the electric chair. And Death Row brings the old forms of the penny dreadful, the murder feuilleton, The Newgate Calendar and the amusement park together in a modern form. It is a rogues' gallery of unsavoury-looking characters: everyone awaiting execution in the United States today is represented by a picture and a paragraph describing their crimes in gory detail. (One is relieved that some of them are behind bars.) Longer articles feature special criminals. And there is a jolly mix of commentary about victims vindicated, liberals and lawyers stymied, rough justice triumphant. Last words are recorded, as are last meals: hamburgers and coke are the most popular. Of late, Texas has been offering a website where those interested can get up-to-the-minute information on specific cases and general policy. No BLTs, for example, because the state does not serve convicts bacon - too expensive. Likewise, those who request T-bone steak get Salisbury steak instead. And so on in edifying detail. There are also modern twists to old themes: in place of the bits of clothing or other souvenirs a crowd could gather in the old days, today's fans can buy replicas of six different electric chairs replete with wrist and ankle restraints and fake flashes of current. (This July, the New York Times ran a small story about a new plaything from McFarland Toys: a model of Death Row Marv, anti-hero of Frank Miller's Sin City, who is strapped to an electric chair and taunts his persecutors with a jeering 'is that the best you can do?' when the switch is thrown. His 'eyes light up as he fries'. Recommended for children of 13 and up; it costs $20.) Even the old pleasures are not what they once were, however. Execution seems just a little embarrassing, a private pleasure to be shared with the like-minded but not something that would survive in broad daylight. Death Row somewhat sheepishly gives over a page of its website to someone whom an earlier edition regarded as guilty but who the editor now thinks is innocent. 'Old Sparky', the electric chair built by prison inmates in Florida, was retired after almost sixty years. Its replacement failed to pass Constitutional muster when the Florida Supreme Court saw videos of what the judges said was the ghastly execution of someone too fat properly to conduct electricity. In fact, from the very beginning in Edison's lab it has not been easy, for all sorts of technical reasons, reliably to kill someone with electricity. A special session of the Florida legislature, following a national trend, opted for lethal injection late last year. Public executions, at which large crowds could actually watch justice being done succumbed to bourgeois sensibilities long ago, during the 19th or early 20th centuries. (The last one - excepting lynchings - in the United States brought a huge festive crowd to the foot of the gallows in Kentucky in the 1930s.) Today we kill at night - over 80 per cent of executions are carried out between 11 p.m. and 7 in the morning (half between midnight and 1 a.m.). Courts have resisted televised executions on all manner of spurious grounds - among them, security problems and safeguarding the identity of those who carry out the procedure. The real reason is that public or pay-per-view executions would be indecent and offensive to 'modern sensibilities'. The few tapes of actual executions, presented as evidence in cases arguing that electrocution and gassing constituted cruel punishment, have not been leaked. The bottom line of capital punishment - the killing itself - has, in short, become almost secret and certainly not something to be enjoyed openly. Some prisons have, of late, made provision for victims' families to witness executions. But there is something half-hearted even here. They are not allowed to see the needle being inserted: because medical ethics prohibit doctors and nurses from carrying out executions, the job falls to paramedics, who are not very experienced and often screw up. Thus the curtain is opened only when everything is in order - condemned strapped to the cross-like gurney, tubes in place - and it is quickly closed again if, as happens in about 10 per cent of cases, something goes wrong. It's a far cry from Hogarth's Idle Apprentice. The victim's friends and family are tidily segregated on one side of the glass-enclosed room, friends of the accused on the other, like friends of the bride and friends of the groom each in their own pews. The scene played out before them looks like the events in an operating theatre, familiar to American viewers from surgery shows on 24-hour cable. Even so, it's strong stuff. In Texas a special Huntsville Regional Post Trauma Unit is on call in the support room to 'prepare victim witnesses and personalise the event', as well as to help them deal with such upsetting contingencies as 'the inmate's last breath sounding like a rattle or snort', his eyes remaining open, or a last statement that is vengeful or lacking remorse. Today, even old-fashioned supporters of capital punishment are too high-minded to allow full expression of the old pleasures. 'Retribution,' the one-time Solicitor General Robert Bork argued before the Supreme Court, 'is itself an important, perhaps a vital, social function.' But retribution must be 'stripped of its vindictiveness'. What sort of retribution, I wonder, is not intended to cause anguish or hurt? What satisfaction could there be in it? Modern sensibilities, secularism and the rule of law - not to speak of a tainted history - have robbed capital punishment of almost all its symbolic powers. Yet there is still something awesome about an execution, perhaps all the more an execution carried out in the bowels of a great institution at dead of night, before a small audience - or none at all - by executioners who in another setting would be doctors and nurses. It has been awesome since Neolithic times, when our ancestors sacrificed humans to assure fertility and through all the festivities of antiquity and the Ancien R\u00e9gime it has remained so. Some people in this country can imagine a secure moral order only if it is somehow underwritten by these exercises in death. Most people would want, on first impulse, to cause as much pain as possible to those who cause pain to their loved ones. It is the work of civilisation to mitigate such impulses, to acknowledge that this sort of sacrificial violence is no longer necessary to sustain the social compact. We no longer live in the supposedly unified communities of old. Human sacrifice is not what keeps a pluralistic society together and it is time that some American politician said as much.",

      "body": "<p>This clash of world views, which has informed the American debate since colonial times, resounds still in books like McFeely's. The poignant stories he tells, of three men who committed terrible crimes, of their defenders, their victims and of the criminal justice system, are embedded in a twisted past and in very different visions of how a new world is to be made. One of the many strengths of his elegant, humane and subtle book is to show how the claims and counterclaims that are so often made like points in a college debate - a 'pro' parry met by an 'anti' retort - are freighted with the burdens of history and the ironies of modernity.</p> <p>In the United States no burden is heavier than that of race. McFeely became involved with the question of the death penalty not because of any expertise in criminology - he had none - but because he had written a biography of Frederick Douglass and a book about the 67 descendants of a slave who had been brought to the tiny barrier island of Sapelo in 1802, where they still live today. Stephen Bright, the indefatigable and brilliant lead counsel of the Southern Center for Human Rights, wanted to make use of McFeely's expertise in African American history. Specifically, Bright asked him to testify in support of two claims which he was making in a motion for a new trial. Bright's client is - the case is not yet resolved - Carzell Moore, a black man convicted, along with an accomplice, of the rape and murder of a 23-year-old white convenience store clerk. He is awaiting execution. Bright planned to argue, first, that under the terms of the 14th Amendment a black man is not 'equally protected' in a Georgia courtroom which, like all the others in the state, displays the Confederate battle flag. And second, that there is an intimate connection between that flag and the bitter history of lynching which underscores the death sentence of any black man in the United States, particularly in the South.</p> <p>In some abstract sense, the flag might represent a proud tradition of states' rights and benign local tradition, as its defenders in South Carolina have recently claimed. But in fact, as McFeely testified, the Georgia story is unambiguous. On 6 February 1956, its Governor vowed that no Negro child would ever attend school with a white one; three days later, the legislature voted to replace the Confederate horizontal bars that had graced the state flag since 1879 with the 'stars and bars': the blue and white cross of St Andrew on an in-your-face field of bright red. Its Civil War service done, this banner had rallied the Ku Klux Klan as it helped re-establish white power in the South during a half-century reign of terror. When, in 1993, the then Georgia Governor asked the legislature to remove this none to0 subtle exhibition of 'pride in the enslavement of many of our ancestors' he was jeered at, and finally withdrew his proposal after some months of hopeless advocacy.</p> <p>There have been 460 lynchings in Georgia since the late 19th century; 411 were of blacks. And, as Bright went on to argue in court, the surge in judicial executions after lynching declined in the 1930s could plausibly be interpreted as the swift removal of a black man by trial, which before had been effected by mob. The cries of 'burn 'em' heard as a murder suspect is booked today echo the cries of those festive crowds that attended the hangings, immolations and castrations of earlier years.</p> <p>The prosecutor who opposed Bright's motion for retrial responded - correctly, in a narrow sense - that this was all quite irrelevant. These facts had no particularly bearing on Carzell Moore; no one was proposing that he be lynched. (I also think that the three white men - die-hard segregationists all - who testified at Bright's behest that they had celebrated the execution of Moore's accomplice would have 'rejoiced' just as exuberantly at the execution of a white man. The festivities at the notorious serial killer Ted Bundy's execution were replete with tailgate beer parties and baseball caps emblazoned with the hindquarters of a pig, as if today's Floridans had read historians' descriptions of pre-modern carnivalesque inversion.) </p> <p>That said, capital punishment in the United States subsists - inescapably - in a miasma of race. The Honorable John H. Land in 1977 presided over the trial of a black man called William Brooks, whose case McFeely follows. Land is the son of a prominent local dignitary who had seen to the lynching of an adolescent boy 65 years earlier. The barefoot 'little black nigger' in question had, miraculously, escaped a murder conviction in the accidental shooting of a white boy. TZ Cotton - the white press and courts of his day never managed to get his name right - was kidnapped from the same Muscogee County Courthouse where Brooks was tried, taken to the edge of town and, begging for his life, pumped full of bullets. Brewster Land, Judge Land's father, was acquitted; none of those who witnessed the abduction and murder would come forward. Forty-four years later, in 1956, a prominent black physician and civil rights leader in the same Georgia town was murdered in the course of a political confrontation: an all-white grand jury refused to indict the white man who shot him - self-defence. Even if, as is clearly the case, the murder trial of Brooks was not a lynching, the distinction is lost on many. The power of the white establishment to maintain the social order through the death of black men is all too evident.</p> <p>Some murders - and some murderers - seem to disrupt that order more than others. McFeely cites David Baldus's massive 1985 study of almost 2500 cases prosecuted in Georgia in the 1970s, which showed some remarkable, if scarcely surprising, racial disparities. If the victim was white the death sentence was far more likely to be imposed than if the victim was black; if the murderer was black he was far more likely to face the electric chair if his victim was white: 22 per cent of black defendants with white victims faced execution, 1 per cent of black defendants with black victims, 3 per cent of white defendants with black victims. These findings are robust: none of hundreds of possible variables will make race go away as the explanation. (Recently, various procedural improvements have made the race of the victim a less powerful predictor than it once was, though it is still important.) </p> <p>A solid social science research tradition going back to the 1940s supports Baldus's study and makes the same sad but juridically irrelevant point: race matters desperately and yet not at all. In 1987, the Supreme Court held in its McCleskey decision that Baldus's and similar findings, though they might well be true, are irrelevant. The fact that the black killer of a white was considerably more likely to die at the hands of a state - Georgia, in this case - than any other racial configuration of killer and killed did not prove that in the particular case of Warren McCleskey, one of four black men convicted of killing a white police officer during a robbery, the defendant suffered his fate because of his race. In principle, the new Georgia criteria for distinguishing capital murder from other kinds and for deciding who would die were race neutral. True enough. (McCleskey died in the electric chair in September 1991.)</p> <p>Yet race and the death penalty are not to be disentangled so neatly. In the first place there is language. Both our modern authorised - judicially sanctioned - and earlier 'unauthorised' executions, or expressions of popular violence, i.e. lynchings, speak of community norms violated, of retribution against execrable creatures who have by their actions forfeited their claim to humane treatment, of the importance of deterrence and of toughness in maintaining 'our way of life'. This is not the rhetoric of the Enlightenment.</p> <p>Then there are the numbers. Lynchings hit their peak in the 1890s as the terror component of the broad legal, economic and social process through which the Jim Crow regime of unquestioned white supremacy established itself in the South. There were at least 1540 of them, about one every other day for ten years. There were, in fact, more lynchings than there were authorised executions by all jurisdictions in the entire country. By the 1930s the number had declined to 'only' 130 per decade; the number of executions by local - county or city - authorities had also declined precipitously. But the total number of executions declined far less rapidly. Executions by states, in fact, increased tenfold as popular violence declined, although the total number never again reached 1890 levels.</p> <p>With respect to rape, the substitution of the state for the lynch mob is painfully clear. Judicially sanctioned execution for rape was almost non-existent in the late 19th and earlier 20th centuries; it was left to popular violence. But as lynching declined the State took over. The number of executions for rape grew dramatically - and almost exclusively - in the South. By 1940, one out of four executions in the South was for rape. And then race: roughly nine out of ten of the 553 men executed before the Supreme Court struck down capital punishment for rape in 1977 - Georgia was the last state to hold out - were black. </p> <p>Finally, geography. The South did not always occupy as high a place in the league tables of execution as it enjoys today. Back in 1930, California, New York and Ohio were in the top ten; Pennsylvania was number 11. (Texas is number one whenever the reckoning starts.) But in the modern history of capital punishment, i.e. the history of its reinstatement and growth since 1976, no one can touch the Southern record. Of course, the death penalty is a national question, if only because the Federal courts are so intimately involved and because 38 states passed new statutes after the old ones were declared unconstitutional in 1972. (Seven of them have not carried out an execution under the new dispensation.) There is also a Federal death penalty to which over fifty new categories of crime covering, for example, drug trafficking, terrorism and killing a Federal poultry inspector, were added in 1995 in an accretion of capital offences matched only in early 18th-century England. No one, however, has been executed by the Federal Government since 1976; two executions are imminent, both are procedurally deeply problematic, and a moratorium is in place while the Attorney General studies the possibility of racial bias in sentencing. </p> <p>Capital punishment nonetheless is a decidedly regional phenomenon. Between 1976 and 23 August this year the ten states of the former Confederacy carried out 75 per cent of all 660 executions; Texas, Virginia and Florida alone accounted for more than 50 per cent. By contrast, in the NorthEast there have been just three executions in 25 years, about 0.5 per cent of the total. Race alone does not entirely account for this remarkable ecology but it is never very far from the surface. Even if the condemned person is not black, it still plays its part. McFeely quotes the former Attorney General Ramsey Clark's impassioned plea in a Federal court for the life of John Spenkelink, the first person in line for execution under the new laws passed to meet the Supreme Court's objections in the Furman decision: because Spenkelink was white, his death, according to Clark, was intended to atone for the past, to 'inoculate Florida from 150 years of racial discrimination'. The judge issued a stay. But Governor Bob Graham, a former opponent of the death penalty, who, McFeely suggests, balanced his progressive policies on race with toughness on crime, refused clemency. Graham's behaviour was typical of the new South. Bill Clinton's followed the same pattern. In his first term as Governor of Arkansas he was regarded as anti-capital punishment and in more than twenty murder cases declined to set execution dates. He lost the 1980 election and came back in 1982 with the promise that he would not commute any more life-without-parole sentences and set execution dates promptly. He kept his word and never again granted clemency or failed to sign an execution warrant promptly.</p> <p> McFeely believes that the revival of capital punishment can be understood as part of a more general revolt against the 1960s. And nowhere was there more to revolt against than in the South, where the status quo was most dramatically uprooted. It is difficult to remember that less than forty years ago a regime of segregation every bit as intricate, humiliating and insidious as the Nuremberg Laws or apartheid was taken for granted in what is now the execution belt. The demise of Jim Crow was without doubt the biggest upheaval of the decade and the civil rights movement the instrument of its overthrow. But women's liberation and gay rights all contributed, McFeely argues, to the sense many people had that something had gone seriously wrong with the moral order. In this context, the very real rise in crime could be attributed to a collapse of values. And a reborn death penalty - along with the internationally unprecedented explosion in incarceration - was meant to set things right. As far as I know, no one has argued seriously that capital punishment at anything like the levels that could be politically imagined actually prevents crime, but support for the gassing, lethal injection or electrocution of a few hundred assorted criminals has become the indisputable sign of 'being tough on crime': indeed, of being tough more generally, softness being assumed to be bad for the country. The anti-1960s backlash is not limited to the South, but McFeely is right in linking it closely to civil rights. The end of the old regime in the South did not result in a progressive alliance of newly enfranchised blacks with New Deal Democrats but produced instead the most reliable conservative voting bloc in the country. Religious denominations which are the theological heirs to the anti-abolitionists of the 19th century play a central role in this new political formation and in keeping the death penalty in place today. Most Supreme Court decisions regarding capital punishment have arisen from cases in the old South.</p> <p>Conversely, both sociologically and ideologically, the movement against capital punishment is a continuation of the civil rights movement in another register. Test cases are brought largely by lawyers from major civil rights organisations - the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, the Southern Poverty Law Center - or those with extensive civil rights litigation experience. Stephen Bright and his colleagues clearly subscribe to Justice Brennan's view that the state 'even as it punishes must treat its members with respect for their intrinsic worth as human beings'. This is the rhetoric of the Montgomery bus boycott, the lunch counter sit-ins, and goes back to Sojourner Truth's 'Ain't I a woman?'</p> <p>Bright speaks of an inalienable humanity in even the most violent of his clients - no child is 'just plain mean' he responded to the prosecuting attorney's characterisation of the young William Brooks. Rehabilitation - 'redemption' in the language of the more religious - is always possible. And on the other side stand those who speak of the right to seek retribution - the adjective 'divine' comes inevitably to mind - in the name of an outraged community. Every criminal put to death is an affirmation of communal self-defence. Frankly, I am not sure how much each individual case matters, although this is how the language of retribution works. I think that what resonates so powerfully with supporters of the death penalty is the very fact that the State is able to execute people in the face of liberal progressive opposition. Seemingly defenceless against the seismic shift in civil rights and other rights besides, some people derive an adamantine solidity - and comfort - in exercising the power of life and death.</p> <p>History, and most particularly the history of race, thus weighs heavily on Americans' most recent embrace of capital punishment. But there is also something new, a procedural revolution, which has deflected the whole debate. And here, too, race plays a critical role. Modernity has crept up on the death penalty and executing someone will never be quite the same again. </p> <p>The procedural revolution has its roots in the late 19th century, when judicial review became far more frequent as individual states and the Federal government came to gain a monopoly on executions at the expense of mob violence and the scarcely more regulated actions of local government. Passion might sway the crowd but the rule of law must at least be seen to govern the State. But it was the Supreme Court's decision in Furman v. Georgia which set modernity in direct confrontation with much of what had been satisfying about punishment by death. The death penalty as it is carried into practice today is like an endangered species brought back from the brink of extinction, a creature from an earlier age making its way in a very different time from when it ruled the earth.</p> <p>The Furman case grew out of the fact that after the Second World War the United States was on track to abandon capital punishment entirely. Executions were increasingly rare; only once after 1950 were there as many as a hundred in one year and by the end of the decade the average was nearer fifty. This meant that, at most, about 1 per cent of all convicted murderers were put to death and, even counting only those who committed so-called capital murder, the percentage rose to at most between 10 and 15. By the middle of the 1960s, the ratio between crime and punishment was even more out of kilter: an average of 36 executions out of about nine thousand murders per year between 1960 and 1964 and then even fewer - seven, then one, then two out of more than ten thousand murders. By the end, less than 0.1 per cent of homicides resulted in an execution. The landmark cases of the 1970s - Furman for effective abolition, Gregg for restoration - have structured the American debate in ways which neither proponents nor opponents anticipated. Neither finds its terms particularly edifying; both are caught up in its contradictions. Advocates decry the procedural niceties which were the price paid for capital punishment's constitutionality. Such elaborate indulgence of criminals displays precisely the sort of 'softness' which capital punishment is supposed to belie. Procedure, dull instrumental rationality with its emphasis on equity and form, undermines the symbolic force of execution as the expression of the outraged community will. And on the other side, opponents who regard the death penalty as a violation of fundamental human rights find themselves arguing instead about jury composition, adequacy of representation and whether gassing, in contrast to lethal injection, constitutes 'cruel and unusual' punishment. Fairness is historically not a big feature of judicial killing, nor is it meant to be - being sure everything is done correctly is not the usual argument of abolitionists. A great displacement thus pervades talk about capital punishment today, one in which the real subject in all its grimness is at one remove.</p> <p>In the new regime the prosecution has to achieve two things before it can send an accused to his or her death. First, it must convince a jury that the defendant is guilty of 'capital' murder: guilty, that is, of murder characterised by statutorily specific aggravating factors - defined in Georgia as 'especially heinous, atrocious or cruel, manifesting exceptional depravity'. It could be that the murderer lay in wait for the victim; that the victim was a child or an old person or a handicapped person, or an officer of the state. (Various states between them have produced hundreds of these aggravating conditions.) But this first step only makes the defendant eligible for death. To secure a death sentence the prosecutor must then persuade a jury, or a judge, or both, depending on the jurisdiction, that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating ones. No guilty verdict leads automatically to execution; each sentence must be determined individually and according to rules. These standards may, in practice, be impossibly high and, once again, race is part of the reason. As every prosecutor and defence attorney would know, black jurors are far more likely to spare the lives of the accused than their white counterparts. Perhaps, as McFeely hints, they feel in their bones the continuity between lynching and state-authorised execution. Or perhaps, in an unconscious exercise of moral proportionality, they weigh punishment for even a terrible crime - the rape and murder of a young woman in one of the cases McFeely recounts - against emotionally exigent historical standards. In 1944, not far from where McFeely testified, a sheriff well fortified by drink took a black man from his house, beat him to death before a large group of witnesses in the courthouse yard and escaped even being charged with murder. He was acquitted of violating the man's civil rights when the Supreme Court in its notorious Screw decision held that, while he had intended to murder his prisoner, he had not intended to violate his civil rights. As Stephen Bright pointed out to the eight black members of the jury at the 1990 retrial he won for William Brooks, the murderers of Medgar Evers, Martin Luther King and the little girls killed in a Birmingham church, all white men with black victims, were not executed or in some cases even convicted: 'Don't let anyone tell you that there has to be a death penalty.' This would have called to mind any number of comparable stories familiar to these jurors: of the men accused of bombing the homes and churches of the ministers who led the Montgomery bus boycott - a capital crime in Alabama at the time - two were acquitted despite making signed confessions and the rest were simply not charged. Perhaps, too, William Brooks's heart-wrenchingly violent childhood at the hands of his father, and his apparent rehabilitation over 15 years might have had more resonance for a black audience. But whatever the reason, seven of the eight black jurors voted in the initial ballot against the death sentence; all four whites voted for it. The sensibility evident in such results is not lost on those selecting juries.</p> <p>Prosecutors in the United States are allowed to insist on a 'death-qualified' jury - a bizarre adjective meaning one composed of citizens all of whom say that they could, in principle, vote for a death sentence. (Opponents argue that such juries are consequently not representative of a community in which a sizable minority is opposed to capital punishment, but that is still another procedural story.) Prosecutors are not allowed to excuse blacks from a jury simply on grounds of race, however powerful a predictor it might be of sympathy for a defence case. The temptation to do just that - to use illegal racial profiling to get a capital conviction and sentence - seems to be irresistible. Occasionally, jurisdictions are caught in flagrante. In one of the cases that McFeely followed, a researcher working on another matter was looking at jury lists for possible voter registration violations and happened on a memorandum that had been accidentally left in an archive box. This piece of carelessness saved the life of one of Bright's clients. Scribbled handwritten numbers, divided by categories, turned out to be codes for black and white men and women; the numbers indicated their representation in the voter list as a proportion of the population as a whole. The point was to allow only enough African Americans on the jury list to defend against a possible Constitutional challenge. In this case, the plan did not work. The judge threw out Tony Amadeo's murder conviction: 'Y'all are wasting your time,' he told the prosecutor, citing this blatant effort by the jury commissioners to under-represent blacks while avoiding a prima facie violation of relevant case law. </p> <p>Manifestly, this is not an isolated, Georgia eccentricity: among McFeely's cases there are others that came to retrial because prosecutors had deliberately excluded blacks from the trial jury. The only black among the seven executed in California since 1976 had as his lawyer a man who had called his secretary a nigger - 'only joking', he said - and who failed to protest the prosecution's challenge to all prospective black jurors. (This lawyer's lapse may have been due to more than racism. He was often drunk and soon after the trial resigned from the state Bar after being convicted of embezzling client funds.) A black man was sent to his death by an all-white jury in 35 of the 285 death penalty cases tried in Illinois since 1976 which were probed in a remarkable series of articles Steve Mills and Ken Armstrong wrote last year for the Chicago Tribune.*</p> <p>Ensuring equitable racial representation is by no means the only endemic procedural problem. Attorneys for the accused must present to the jury exculpatory or at least mitigating evidence if the standard - or the fiction - of procedurally rational capital punishment is to be maintained. The biggest determinant in all criminal cases is the quality of representation and that, of course, is closely correlated with the income of the accused. Not everyone is entitled to the O.J. Simpson dream team, but even the poor must have a jury that at least considers mitigation against aggravation. And here, too, the system fails. </p> <p>The trial attorneys in some of McFeely's cases were less than effective, but not by comparison with the general run of representation in capital trials. For this difficult, high-stakes assignment states all too often recruit some of the Bar's most inexperienced or incompetent members. The compensation offered is laughable, and only recently did many states agree to pay defence costs at all: there is a $1000 limit in Mississippi; $20 an hour in Alabama up to a maximum of $2000 and even less in some Texas counties. The takers at these prices are a bunch of losers, or worse. One study found that in 1989 attorneys who were later disbarred, suspended or imprisoned had represented 25 per cent of all Kentucky Death Row inmates. And things have not improved much. The Chicago Tribune found that attorneys so incompetent, unethical or criminal as to face disbarment or suspension represented 33 Illinois defendants (12 per cent) who were sentenced to death.</p> <p>As a result of these and other shortcomings judicial killing, an ancient form of retribution, is embroiled in the niceties of the contemporary rule of law, in precisely the kinds of appeals and retrials which constitute the work of the Southern Center for Human Rights. About 40 per cent of the five thousand death sentences meted out between 1976 and the mid-1990s were overturned on appeal. But perhaps the most remarkable consequence of the peculiar legal trajectory by which the US came back to the death penalty is the time which it now takes to execute someone. </p> <p>The job of people like Stephen Bright and other attorneys who oppose the death penalty is not to attack it frontally but to force the system to adhere to its own rules for administering it. The ultimate punishment demands scrupulous attention to detail and cannot be hurried. Even with routine representation - and many on Death Row have no attorney at all to handle their appeal - the process of mandatory appeal takes years. In 1960, it took a little over a year to go from sentence to execution: in Georgia today it takes an average of eight years, and the cases McFeely writes about have been stretched out for more than a decade. (In the 18th century it was a matter of weeks.) Thus another collision between the symbolic power of the death penalty and modernity is born. It may well be satisfying to kill the monster who repeatedly thrust an ice-pick into her victim during a drug-crazed robbery. But 15 years later that monster is no longer what she once was. David Hume had a point: a serious problem of personal continuity arises here and even proponents of the death penalty know it. A former Mississippi warden who supervised four executions in the early 1990s reports that he and his colleagues are often rattled by escorting someone to die whom they have known for a decade or more: 'If you have someone in prison for 15 to 20 years, you have a sense that when you take him into the execution chamber, you're not taking the same guy in there that came into prison.' </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/lrb/articles/0,6109,374577,00.html\">Continued in part 3</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "This clash of world views, which has informed the American debate since colonial times, resounds still in books like McFeely's. The poignant stories he tells, of three men who committed terrible crimes, of their defenders, their victims and of the criminal justice system, are embedded in a twisted past and in very different visions of how a new world is to be made. One of the many strengths of his elegant, humane and subtle book is to show how the claims and counterclaims that are so often made like points in a college debate - a 'pro' parry met by an 'anti' retort - are freighted with the burdens of history and the ironies of modernity. In the United States no burden is heavier than that of race. McFeely became involved with the question of the death penalty not because of any expertise in criminology - he had none - but because he had written a biography of Frederick Douglass and a book about the 67 descendants of a slave who had been brought to the tiny barrier island of Sapelo in 1802, where they still live today. Stephen Bright, the indefatigable and brilliant lead counsel of the Southern Center for Human Rights, wanted to make use of McFeely's expertise in African American history. Specifically, Bright asked him to testify in support of two claims which he was making in a motion for a new trial. Bright's client is - the case is not yet resolved - Carzell Moore, a black man convicted, along with an accomplice, of the rape and murder of a 23-year-old white convenience store clerk. He is awaiting execution. Bright planned to argue, first, that under the terms of the 14th Amendment a black man is not 'equally protected' in a Georgia courtroom which, like all the others in the state, displays the Confederate battle flag. And second, that there is an intimate connection between that flag and the bitter history of lynching which underscores the death sentence of any black man in the United States, particularly in the South. In some abstract sense, the flag might represent a proud tradition of states' rights and benign local tradition, as its defenders in South Carolina have recently claimed. But in fact, as McFeely testified, the Georgia story is unambiguous. On 6 February 1956, its Governor vowed that no Negro child would ever attend school with a white one; three days later, the legislature voted to replace the Confederate horizontal bars that had graced the state flag since 1879 with the 'stars and bars': the blue and white cross of St Andrew on an in-your-face field of bright red. Its Civil War service done, this banner had rallied the Ku Klux Klan as it helped re-establish white power in the South during a half-century reign of terror. When, in 1993, the then Georgia Governor asked the legislature to remove this none to0 subtle exhibition of 'pride in the enslavement of many of our ancestors' he was jeered at, and finally withdrew his proposal after some months of hopeless advocacy. There have been 460 lynchings in Georgia since the late 19th century; 411 were of blacks. And, as Bright went on to argue in court, the surge in judicial executions after lynching declined in the 1930s could plausibly be interpreted as the swift removal of a black man by trial, which before had been effected by mob. The cries of 'burn 'em' heard as a murder suspect is booked today echo the cries of those festive crowds that attended the hangings, immolations and castrations of earlier years. The prosecutor who opposed Bright's motion for retrial responded - correctly, in a narrow sense - that this was all quite irrelevant. These facts had no particularly bearing on Carzell Moore; no one was proposing that he be lynched. (I also think that the three white men - die-hard segregationists all - who testified at Bright's behest that they had celebrated the execution of Moore's accomplice would have 'rejoiced' just as exuberantly at the execution of a white man. The festivities at the notorious serial killer Ted Bundy's execution were replete with tailgate beer parties and baseball caps emblazoned with the hindquarters of a pig, as if today's Floridans had read historians' descriptions of pre-modern carnivalesque inversion.) That said, capital punishment in the United States subsists - inescapably - in a miasma of race. The Honorable John H. Land in 1977 presided over the trial of a black man called William Brooks, whose case McFeely follows. Land is the son of a prominent local dignitary who had seen to the lynching of an adolescent boy 65 years earlier. The barefoot 'little black nigger' in question had, miraculously, escaped a murder conviction in the accidental shooting of a white boy. TZ Cotton - the white press and courts of his day never managed to get his name right - was kidnapped from the same Muscogee County Courthouse where Brooks was tried, taken to the edge of town and, begging for his life, pumped full of bullets. Brewster Land, Judge Land's father, was acquitted; none of those who witnessed the abduction and murder would come forward. Forty-four years later, in 1956, a prominent black physician and civil rights leader in the same Georgia town was murdered in the course of a political confrontation: an all-white grand jury refused to indict the white man who shot him - self-defence. Even if, as is clearly the case, the murder trial of Brooks was not a lynching, the distinction is lost on many. The power of the white establishment to maintain the social order through the death of black men is all too evident. Some murders - and some murderers - seem to disrupt that order more than others. McFeely cites David Baldus's massive 1985 study of almost 2500 cases prosecuted in Georgia in the 1970s, which showed some remarkable, if scarcely surprising, racial disparities. If the victim was white the death sentence was far more likely to be imposed than if the victim was black; if the murderer was black he was far more likely to face the electric chair if his victim was white: 22 per cent of black defendants with white victims faced execution, 1 per cent of black defendants with black victims, 3 per cent of white defendants with black victims. These findings are robust: none of hundreds of possible variables will make race go away as the explanation. (Recently, various procedural improvements have made the race of the victim a less powerful predictor than it once was, though it is still important.) A solid social science research tradition going back to the 1940s supports Baldus's study and makes the same sad but juridically irrelevant point: race matters desperately and yet not at all. In 1987, the Supreme Court held in its McCleskey decision that Baldus's and similar findings, though they might well be true, are irrelevant. The fact that the black killer of a white was considerably more likely to die at the hands of a state - Georgia, in this case - than any other racial configuration of killer and killed did not prove that in the particular case of Warren McCleskey, one of four black men convicted of killing a white police officer during a robbery, the defendant suffered his fate because of his race. In principle, the new Georgia criteria for distinguishing capital murder from other kinds and for deciding who would die were race neutral. True enough. (McCleskey died in the electric chair in September 1991.) Yet race and the death penalty are not to be disentangled so neatly. In the first place there is language. Both our modern authorised - judicially sanctioned - and earlier 'unauthorised' executions, or expressions of popular violence, i.e. lynchings, speak of community norms violated, of retribution against execrable creatures who have by their actions forfeited their claim to humane treatment, of the importance of deterrence and of toughness in maintaining 'our way of life'. This is not the rhetoric of the Enlightenment. Then there are the numbers. Lynchings hit their peak in the 1890s as the terror component of the broad legal, economic and social process through which the Jim Crow regime of unquestioned white supremacy established itself in the South. There were at least 1540 of them, about one every other day for ten years. There were, in fact, more lynchings than there were authorised executions by all jurisdictions in the entire country. By the 1930s the number had declined to 'only' 130 per decade; the number of executions by local - county or city - authorities had also declined precipitously. But the total number of executions declined far less rapidly. Executions by states, in fact, increased tenfold as popular violence declined, although the total number never again reached 1890 levels. With respect to rape, the substitution of the state for the lynch mob is painfully clear. Judicially sanctioned execution for rape was almost non-existent in the late 19th and earlier 20th centuries; it was left to popular violence. But as lynching declined the State took over. The number of executions for rape grew dramatically - and almost exclusively - in the South. By 1940, one out of four executions in the South was for rape. And then race: roughly nine out of ten of the 553 men executed before the Supreme Court struck down capital punishment for rape in 1977 - Georgia was the last state to hold out - were black. Finally, geography. The South did not always occupy as high a place in the league tables of execution as it enjoys today. Back in 1930, California, New York and Ohio were in the top ten; Pennsylvania was number 11. (Texas is number one whenever the reckoning starts.) But in the modern history of capital punishment, i.e. the history of its reinstatement and growth since 1976, no one can touch the Southern record. Of course, the death penalty is a national question, if only because the Federal courts are so intimately involved and because 38 states passed new statutes after the old ones were declared unconstitutional in 1972. (Seven of them have not carried out an execution under the new dispensation.) There is also a Federal death penalty to which over fifty new categories of crime covering, for example, drug trafficking, terrorism and killing a Federal poultry inspector, were added in 1995 in an accretion of capital offences matched only in early 18th-century England. No one, however, has been executed by the Federal Government since 1976; two executions are imminent, both are procedurally deeply problematic, and a moratorium is in place while the Attorney General studies the possibility of racial bias in sentencing. Capital punishment nonetheless is a decidedly regional phenomenon. Between 1976 and 23 August this year the ten states of the former Confederacy carried out 75 per cent of all 660 executions; Texas, Virginia and Florida alone accounted for more than 50 per cent. By contrast, in the NorthEast there have been just three executions in 25 years, about 0.5 per cent of the total. Race alone does not entirely account for this remarkable ecology but it is never very far from the surface. Even if the condemned person is not black, it still plays its part. McFeely quotes the former Attorney General Ramsey Clark's impassioned plea in a Federal court for the life of John Spenkelink, the first person in line for execution under the new laws passed to meet the Supreme Court's objections in the Furman decision: because Spenkelink was white, his death, according to Clark, was intended to atone for the past, to 'inoculate Florida from 150 years of racial discrimination'. The judge issued a stay. But Governor Bob Graham, a former opponent of the death penalty, who, McFeely suggests, balanced his progressive policies on race with toughness on crime, refused clemency. Graham's behaviour was typical of the new South. Bill Clinton's followed the same pattern. In his first term as Governor of Arkansas he was regarded as anti-capital punishment and in more than twenty murder cases declined to set execution dates. He lost the 1980 election and came back in 1982 with the promise that he would not commute any more life-without-parole sentences and set execution dates promptly. He kept his word and never again granted clemency or failed to sign an execution warrant promptly. McFeely believes that the revival of capital punishment can be understood as part of a more general revolt against the 1960s. And nowhere was there more to revolt against than in the South, where the status quo was most dramatically uprooted. It is difficult to remember that less than forty years ago a regime of segregation every bit as intricate, humiliating and insidious as the Nuremberg Laws or apartheid was taken for granted in what is now the execution belt. The demise of Jim Crow was without doubt the biggest upheaval of the decade and the civil rights movement the instrument of its overthrow. But women's liberation and gay rights all contributed, McFeely argues, to the sense many people had that something had gone seriously wrong with the moral order. In this context, the very real rise in crime could be attributed to a collapse of values. And a reborn death penalty - along with the internationally unprecedented explosion in incarceration - was meant to set things right. As far as I know, no one has argued seriously that capital punishment at anything like the levels that could be politically imagined actually prevents crime, but support for the gassing, lethal injection or electrocution of a few hundred assorted criminals has become the indisputable sign of 'being tough on crime': indeed, of being tough more generally, softness being assumed to be bad for the country. The anti-1960s backlash is not limited to the South, but McFeely is right in linking it closely to civil rights. The end of the old regime in the South did not result in a progressive alliance of newly enfranchised blacks with New Deal Democrats but produced instead the most reliable conservative voting bloc in the country. Religious denominations which are the theological heirs to the anti-abolitionists of the 19th century play a central role in this new political formation and in keeping the death penalty in place today. Most Supreme Court decisions regarding capital punishment have arisen from cases in the old South. Conversely, both sociologically and ideologically, the movement against capital punishment is a continuation of the civil rights movement in another register. Test cases are brought largely by lawyers from major civil rights organisations - the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, the Southern Poverty Law Center - or those with extensive civil rights litigation experience. Stephen Bright and his colleagues clearly subscribe to Justice Brennan's view that the state 'even as it punishes must treat its members with respect for their intrinsic worth as human beings'. This is the rhetoric of the Montgomery bus boycott, the lunch counter sit-ins, and goes back to Sojourner Truth's 'Ain't I a woman?' Bright speaks of an inalienable humanity in even the most violent of his clients - no child is 'just plain mean' he responded to the prosecuting attorney's characterisation of the young William Brooks. Rehabilitation - 'redemption' in the language of the more religious - is always possible. And on the other side stand those who speak of the right to seek retribution - the adjective 'divine' comes inevitably to mind - in the name of an outraged community. Every criminal put to death is an affirmation of communal self-defence. Frankly, I am not sure how much each individual case matters, although this is how the language of retribution works. I think that what resonates so powerfully with supporters of the death penalty is the very fact that the State is able to execute people in the face of liberal progressive opposition. Seemingly defenceless against the seismic shift in civil rights and other rights besides, some people derive an adamantine solidity - and comfort - in exercising the power of life and death. History, and most particularly the history of race, thus weighs heavily on Americans' most recent embrace of capital punishment. But there is also something new, a procedural revolution, which has deflected the whole debate. And here, too, race plays a critical role. Modernity has crept up on the death penalty and executing someone will never be quite the same again. The procedural revolution has its roots in the late 19th century, when judicial review became far more frequent as individual states and the Federal government came to gain a monopoly on executions at the expense of mob violence and the scarcely more regulated actions of local government. Passion might sway the crowd but the rule of law must at least be seen to govern the State. But it was the Supreme Court's decision in Furman v. Georgia which set modernity in direct confrontation with much of what had been satisfying about punishment by death. The death penalty as it is carried into practice today is like an endangered species brought back from the brink of extinction, a creature from an earlier age making its way in a very different time from when it ruled the earth. The Furman case grew out of the fact that after the Second World War the United States was on track to abandon capital punishment entirely. Executions were increasingly rare; only once after 1950 were there as many as a hundred in one year and by the end of the decade the average was nearer fifty. This meant that, at most, about 1 per cent of all convicted murderers were put to death and, even counting only those who committed so-called capital murder, the percentage rose to at most between 10 and 15. By the middle of the 1960s, the ratio between crime and punishment was even more out of kilter: an average of 36 executions out of about nine thousand murders per year between 1960 and 1964 and then even fewer - seven, then one, then two out of more than ten thousand murders. By the end, less than 0.1 per cent of homicides resulted in an execution. The landmark cases of the 1970s - Furman for effective abolition, Gregg for restoration - have structured the American debate in ways which neither proponents nor opponents anticipated. Neither finds its terms particularly edifying; both are caught up in its contradictions. Advocates decry the procedural niceties which were the price paid for capital punishment's constitutionality. Such elaborate indulgence of criminals displays precisely the sort of 'softness' which capital punishment is supposed to belie. Procedure, dull instrumental rationality with its emphasis on equity and form, undermines the symbolic force of execution as the expression of the outraged community will. And on the other side, opponents who regard the death penalty as a violation of fundamental human rights find themselves arguing instead about jury composition, adequacy of representation and whether gassing, in contrast to lethal injection, constitutes 'cruel and unusual' punishment. Fairness is historically not a big feature of judicial killing, nor is it meant to be - being sure everything is done correctly is not the usual argument of abolitionists. A great displacement thus pervades talk about capital punishment today, one in which the real subject in all its grimness is at one remove. In the new regime the prosecution has to achieve two things before it can send an accused to his or her death. First, it must convince a jury that the defendant is guilty of 'capital' murder: guilty, that is, of murder characterised by statutorily specific aggravating factors - defined in Georgia as 'especially heinous, atrocious or cruel, manifesting exceptional depravity'. It could be that the murderer lay in wait for the victim; that the victim was a child or an old person or a handicapped person, or an officer of the state. (Various states between them have produced hundreds of these aggravating conditions.) But this first step only makes the defendant eligible for death. To secure a death sentence the prosecutor must then persuade a jury, or a judge, or both, depending on the jurisdiction, that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating ones. No guilty verdict leads automatically to execution; each sentence must be determined individually and according to rules. These standards may, in practice, be impossibly high and, once again, race is part of the reason. As every prosecutor and defence attorney would know, black jurors are far more likely to spare the lives of the accused than their white counterparts. Perhaps, as McFeely hints, they feel in their bones the continuity between lynching and state-authorised execution. Or perhaps, in an unconscious exercise of moral proportionality, they weigh punishment for even a terrible crime - the rape and murder of a young woman in one of the cases McFeely recounts - against emotionally exigent historical standards. In 1944, not far from where McFeely testified, a sheriff well fortified by drink took a black man from his house, beat him to death before a large group of witnesses in the courthouse yard and escaped even being charged with murder. He was acquitted of violating the man's civil rights when the Supreme Court in its notorious Screw decision held that, while he had intended to murder his prisoner, he had not intended to violate his civil rights. As Stephen Bright pointed out to the eight black members of the jury at the 1990 retrial he won for William Brooks, the murderers of Medgar Evers, Martin Luther King and the little girls killed in a Birmingham church, all white men with black victims, were not executed or in some cases even convicted: 'Don't let anyone tell you that there has to be a death penalty.' This would have called to mind any number of comparable stories familiar to these jurors: of the men accused of bombing the homes and churches of the ministers who led the Montgomery bus boycott - a capital crime in Alabama at the time - two were acquitted despite making signed confessions and the rest were simply not charged. Perhaps, too, William Brooks's heart-wrenchingly violent childhood at the hands of his father, and his apparent rehabilitation over 15 years might have had more resonance for a black audience. But whatever the reason, seven of the eight black jurors voted in the initial ballot against the death sentence; all four whites voted for it. The sensibility evident in such results is not lost on those selecting juries. Prosecutors in the United States are allowed to insist on a 'death-qualified' jury - a bizarre adjective meaning one composed of citizens all of whom say that they could, in principle, vote for a death sentence.

This piece of carelessness saved the life of one of Bright's clients. Scribbled handwritten numbers, divided by categories, turned out to be codes for black and white men and women; the numbers indicated their representation in the voter list as a proportion of the population as a whole. The point was to allow only enough African Americans on the jury list to defend against a possible Constitutional challenge. In this case, the plan did not work. The judge threw out Tony Amadeo's murder conviction: 'Y'all are wasting your time,' he told the prosecutor, citing this blatant effort by the jury commissioners to under-represent blacks while avoiding a prima facie violation of relevant case law. Manifestly, this is not an isolated, Georgia eccentricity: among McFeely's cases there are others that came to retrial because prosecutors had deliberately excluded blacks from the trial jury. The only black among the seven executed in California since 1976 had as his lawyer a man who had called his secretary a nigger - 'only joking', he said - and who failed to protest the prosecution's challenge to all prospective black jurors.

The Chicago Tribune found that attorneys so incompetent, unethical or criminal as to face disbarment or suspension represented 33 Illinois defendants (12 per cent) who were sentenced to death. As a result of these and other shortcomings judicial killing, an ancient form of retribution, is embroiled in the niceties of the contemporary rule of law, in precisely the kinds of appeals and retrials which constitute the work of the Southern Center for Human Rights. About 40 per cent of the five thousand death sentences meted out between 1976 and the mid-1990s were overturned on appeal. But perhaps the most remarkable consequence of the peculiar legal trajectory by which the US came back to the death penalty is the time which it now takes to execute someone. The job of people like Stephen Bright and other attorneys who oppose the death penalty is not to attack it frontally but to force the system to adhere to its own rules for administering it. The ultimate punishment demands scrupulous attention to detail and cannot be hurried. Even with routine representation - and many on Death Row have no attorney at all to handle their appeal - the process of mandatory appeal takes years. In 1960, it took a little over a year to go from sentence to execution: in Georgia today it takes an average of eight years, and the cases McFeely writes about have been stretched out for more than a decade. (In the 18th century it was a matter of weeks.) Thus another collision between the symbolic power of the death penalty and modernity is born. It may well be satisfying to kill the monster who repeatedly thrust an ice-pick into her victim during a drug-crazed robbery. But 15 years later that monster is no longer what she once was. David Hume had a point: a serious problem of personal continuity arises here and even proponents of the death penalty know it. A former Mississippi warden who supervised four executions in the early 1990s reports that he and his colleagues are often rattled by escorting someone to die whom they have known for a decade or more: 'If you have someone in prison for 15 to 20 years, you have a sense that when you take him into the execution chamber, you're not taking the same guy in there that came into prison.'

      "body": "<p><strong>KOOG FOUGHT THE LAW, THE OTHER COUNTRY WON</strong></p> <p>Whatever comes out of Kelvin Koogan's mouth always has an equal and opposite reaction. That's Koogan's First Law and it should be drummed - with the help of a bendy cane if necessary - into the mind of every schoolboy in the land. Today there was yet another textbook example of the Law at work. First Koog announced some good news: Joe Cole is in the 27-man England squad for the World Cup qualifiers against Germany and Finland. Then the bad inevitably followed: Jamie Carragher has been picked as well.</p> <p>\"Joe is a rare talent,\" said Koog of the West Ham prodigy. \"He can turn a game that's tight, he can change the course of a game. I believe he's ready, willing and able to perform at the very top level.\" Everyone nodded their heads at his sagacity, before shaking them in disbelief when he insisted that Carragher was \"a gem of a player\". You mean one of those discarded Ratners ones, thought the Fiver. But Koog was obviously being completely serious, because he went on: \"You ask him to do a job, and he does it. No question he deserves his chance.\"</p> <p>Ridiculous scouse curveball apart, the England squad is much as predicted: there are recalls for Robbie Fowler, Graeme Le Saux and Ray Parlour - and with Sol Campbell out injured, David Beckham has been made vice-captain. Equally unsurprisingly, manager Koog is raring to go. \"There's nothing bigger in football than the World Cup, and we desperately want to be there,\" he chirped. \"The aim is to get off to a fantastic start, which means six points out of six.\" Hurrah! cheered the nation, and everyone went home happy.</p> <p>The full squad: Seaman, Martyn, James, P Neville, Le Saux, G Neville, Barry, Adams, Keown, Southgate, Ferdinand, Carragher, Ince, Dyer, Wise, Beckham, Barmby, Scholes, McManaman, J Cole, Parlour, Gerrard, Owen, A Cole, Phillips, Fowler, Heskey.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>ADVERTISEMENT</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.easyshop.co.uk/easyshop/fgf.asp?promo=SU1946LC\">Thinking about lingerie? \u00a310 voucher to use when you spend \u00a330 or more at Easyshop.

Even Julian Joachim considers the seven-time title winners beneath him, for goodness sake - although when you're so obviously more talented than Ronaldo, you can be excused a little arrogance. But it's not all bad news for Villa's personnel administrator John Gregory. One Villa player wants to wear the claret and blue until the end of time and that's Ozalan \"I really want to play for a better Premiership club\" Alpay.</p> <p>Yesterday, Alpay was \"reported\" to have \"revealed\" his \"desire\" to leave Villa for a bigger team. But it turns out the giant Turkish defender was severely misquoted (can you believe it?). \"Nothing that has been said is true,\" he dramatically pleaded today. \"Everything is wrong. I never said anything like that and I am very disappointed. I am happy. I like the team, the manager and my team-mates, I like the supporters, they like me and I like the way Villa play. If Villa don't send me away then I will stay here.\"</p> <p>Isn't he a sweetheart? The Fiver is sure that Alpay's genuine and heartfelt explanation - \"In the summer back in Turkey I said I wanted to go to a better club, and Villa is that club.\" - will ensure he is never \"sent away\". It would be terrible if slack journalism caused an innocent individual unwarranted heartache - that's something nobody wants to see.

      "body": "<p>Ten years ago, amid the furore generated by the publication of the Satanic Verses, an election in the Brookhouse ward of Blackburn sent a warning ripple through the Labour party. The Tory candidate, Abdul Bhika, overturned a huge Labour majority to capture the seat. It appeared a remarkable achievement - the first recorded instance that the so-called ethnic minorities had exercised their collective clout at the ballot box. But a deeper analysis revealed otherwise. The mass defection from Labour was confined to Muslims, venting their disgust at Labour's stand on the Rushdie affair.</p> <p>This week's Labour conference was warned that the failure to put up significant numbers of ethnic minority candidates could cost votes. The warning is an empty one. You can't expect black people to identify with each other on the basis of their colour any more than you can expect it of whites. Spare me the argument that all people of dark pigmentation share a history of colonisation and racism that gives them common cause. Assuming all black people identify with the oppressed is as absurd as assuming whites identify with their oppressive history.</p> <p>Once you start talking about an ethnic minority community, it's not a huge leap to the idea of an ethnic minority vote. Here is where the race activists' flights of fancy really start to soar. Conceiving of the ethnic minority as a single entity has the (intended) effect of investing it with a political importance way in excess of its actual clout. This is best seen in the failures of the Operation Black Vote (OBV) campaign. Set up in 1996 by Charter 88 and the 1990 Trust, one of the organisation's main goals is to \"demonstrate a collective community potential that could significantly influence the outcome in many seats at the general election\".</p> <p>Easier said than done. In practice, the black block vote has never been actualised. The 1997 general election came and went without black voters rallying round any cause or party. The same was true in the European and the Greater London elections.</p> <p>In fact, it is fractiousness, not unity, that characterises black politics. In the run-up to the last general election, infighting among local factions in the majority Bangladeshi constituency, Bethnal Green and Bow, denied the Bangladeshi hopeful, Pola Uddin, the Labour candidacy. The picture was pretty much the same in Bradford West, where clan and personality differences allowed a Sikh candidate, Marsha Singh, to prevail, in spite of the fact that the local Labour party is dominated by Pakistani Muslims.</p> <p>So why have the ethnic minorities failed to utilise their block vote - especially, if as we are routinely reminded, their concentration in urban areas makes them so statistically powerful?</p> <p>Although few are prepared to risk charges of treachery or racism to say so, the answer is obvious. There is no homogeneous group in this country that can be called \"the black community\", even loosely. One definition of black I found on the OBV website is \"any person having an African, Asian or Caribbean descent who also identifies as black in terms of their life experience and treatment by society and those in authority\".</p> <p>Come on.

      "bodyText": "Ten years ago, amid the furore generated by the publication of the Satanic Verses, an election in the Brookhouse ward of Blackburn sent a warning ripple through the Labour party. The Tory candidate, Abdul Bhika, overturned a huge Labour majority to capture the seat. It appeared a remarkable achievement - the first recorded instance that the so-called ethnic minorities had exercised their collective clout at the ballot box. But a deeper analysis revealed otherwise. The mass defection from Labour was confined to Muslims, venting their disgust at Labour's stand on the Rushdie affair. This week's Labour conference was warned that the failure to put up significant numbers of ethnic minority candidates could cost votes. The warning is an empty one. You can't expect black people to identify with each other on the basis of their colour any more than you can expect it of whites. Spare me the argument that all people of dark pigmentation share a history of colonisation and racism that gives them common cause. Assuming all black people identify with the oppressed is as absurd as assuming whites identify with their oppressive history. Once you start talking about an ethnic minority community, it's not a huge leap to the idea of an ethnic minority vote. Here is where the race activists' flights of fancy really start to soar. Conceiving of the ethnic minority as a single entity has the (intended) effect of investing it with a political importance way in excess of its actual clout. This is best seen in the failures of the Operation Black Vote (OBV) campaign. Set up in 1996 by Charter 88 and the 1990 Trust, one of the organisation's main goals is to \"demonstrate a collective community potential that could significantly influence the outcome in many seats at the general election\". Easier said than done. In practice, the black block vote has never been actualised. The 1997 general election came and went without black voters rallying round any cause or party. The same was true in the European and the Greater London elections. In fact, it is fractiousness, not unity, that characterises black politics. In the run-up to the last general election, infighting among local factions in the majority Bangladeshi constituency, Bethnal Green and Bow, denied the Bangladeshi hopeful, Pola Uddin, the Labour candidacy. The picture was pretty much the same in Bradford West, where clan and personality differences allowed a Sikh candidate, Marsha Singh, to prevail, in spite of the fact that the local Labour party is dominated by Pakistani Muslims. So why have the ethnic minorities failed to utilise their block vote - especially, if as we are routinely reminded, their concentration in urban areas makes them so statistically powerful? Although few are prepared to risk charges of treachery or racism to say so, the answer is obvious. There is no homogeneous group in this country that can be called \"the black community\", even loosely. One definition of black I found on the OBV website is \"any person having an African, Asian or Caribbean descent who also identifies as black in terms of their life experience and treatment by society and those in authority\". Come on. Does racism make up such an overwhelming part of our experience that the fight against it must be the basis of our whole political outlook? Most of us would like to believe we are more rounded individuals, living textured, forward-looking lives whose behaviour is not driven by a single-minded - at times obsessive - impulse to get even. But the sad reality is that minority thinking in this country is dominated by a proselytising clique bent on converting everyone else to their imaginary black-and-white worldview. To that extent most of what passes for race relations is nothing but a cynical social engineering exercise, often damaging the very fabric it claims to be trying to repair by poisoning minds with the rhetoric of race dialectics. Black identity is predicated on the idea that dark people are united by their shared experience of racism. It is a fallacy.

      "body": "<p>Behind the one-way mirror, a group of consumers is discussing the internet and how they use it. Carly confesses that she is having a virtual affair with a married man in his 40s. He believes that Carly is 28, tall, blonde and blue-eyed. In fact, Carly is a short redhead. She is also 13 years old. </p> <p>\"You get some amazing stuff coming out of focus groups,\" says Robin Lauffer, executive planning director of McCann Erickson, an advertising agency which has organised the session. \"People are prepared to discuss all sorts of things that they wouldn't normally talk about and you get a real insight into their lives.\" </p> <p>While the revelations are rarely as surprising as those offered by Carly, more and more organisations are using focus groups to elicit consumers' views on everything from the future of the monarchy to yoghurt flavourings. Central government, local authorities, hospitals and even churches are all trying to find out what makes people tick, but it is advertising agencies that have pioneered the use of the focus group to get inside consumers' heads. </p> <p>\"There are more focus groups than ever. All sorts of companies and organisations are trying to really understand their customers, and the easiest and cheapest way of doing it is to run a focus group,\" says Wendy Gordon, the founder of a consultancy called the Fourth Room. </p> <p>Gordon, who has run thousands of such groups, says they are brought together by a professional recruiter who looks for people of a certain age, social type or whatever criteria the client specifies. </p> <p>Those taking part must be prepared to spend a couple of hours answering questions and being watched by the client and agency staff behind a one-way mirror. In return, they get plenty of cheap wine, peanuts, about \u00a320 in cash and their travelling expenses. They might be asked anything from their views on a new advertising campaign to why they prefer one particular brand of orange juice to another. </p> <p>\"Focus groups are a great weapon and a very dangerous one,\" says Lauffer. One of the problems is that too much can be read into what people say. \"Take Carly here - we don't know how much of it she is making up to show off, or if it is actually true.\" </p> <p>Gordon agrees. \"People don't always mean what they say or say what they mean.\" She says some people will say what they think the questioner wants to hear, others will make things up, some are too intimidated to voice an opinion and some groups will be dominated by one person. </p> <p>Then there are the focus groupies - people who attend over and over again, says Janet Grimes, head of planning at another advertising agency, Ogilvy &amp; Mather. \"They are difficult to spot because they have been coached by the recruiter and told not to let on that they have been to a group before. Some do it for the money, some because they want a soapbox or feel flattered that companies are interested in their opinions.\" </p> <p>John Simms (not his real name) is a self-confessed focus groupie. \"Basically, I know someone who recruits for focus groups and I do it for the money,\" he says. \"I'm a mature student but I've pretended to be an internet entrepreneur and all sorts of other things. They offer between \u00a320 and \u00a350 for a couple of hours of chat. I've talked about cars, although I can't drive, and mobile phones, although I haven't got one. I've also done drinks and bank accounts. It's easy. Some of them provide decent wine and food and it's a bit of a laugh making up opinions.\" </p> <p>However, Grimes warns that focus groupies soon begin to give themselves away: \"They start to use marketing language and jargon that they wouldn't really know unless they did a lot of focus groups.\" </p> <p>Aware of this, advertising agencies are turning to new techniques. Beware researchers bearing cameras - like the makers of Big Brother, they want to know the most intimate details of your life, but only so they can sell you more beer, soap or mar garine. We have progressed beyond the idea that people are laboratory rats to be observed from behind a one-way mirror or that they will give you any real insight in a cocktail party setting,\" says Gordon. \"We like to see people in context - so if they are shopping in the supermarket, then we film them doing it.\" For one toiletries manufacturer, for example, Gordon's company filmed people in the shower to find out how they felt about the product they were using. </p> <p>\"Focus groups can be pretty artificial. We like to talk to people in their own homes,\" confirms Lauffer.

      "bodyText": "Behind the one-way mirror, a group of consumers is discussing the internet and how they use it. Carly confesses that she is having a virtual affair with a married man in his 40s. He believes that Carly is 28, tall, blonde and blue-eyed. In fact, Carly is a short redhead. She is also 13 years old. \"You get some amazing stuff coming out of focus groups,\" says Robin Lauffer, executive planning director of McCann Erickson, an advertising agency which has organised the session. \"People are prepared to discuss all sorts of things that they wouldn't normally talk about and you get a real insight into their lives.\" While the revelations are rarely as surprising as those offered by Carly, more and more organisations are using focus groups to elicit consumers' views on everything from the future of the monarchy to yoghurt flavourings. Central government, local authorities, hospitals and even churches are all trying to find out what makes people tick, but it is advertising agencies that have pioneered the use of the focus group to get inside consumers' heads. \"There are more focus groups than ever. All sorts of companies and organisations are trying to really understand their customers, and the easiest and cheapest way of doing it is to run a focus group,\" says Wendy Gordon, the founder of a consultancy called the Fourth Room. Gordon, who has run thousands of such groups, says they are brought together by a professional recruiter who looks for people of a certain age, social type or whatever criteria the client specifies. Those taking part must be prepared to spend a couple of hours answering questions and being watched by the client and agency staff behind a one-way mirror. In return, they get plenty of cheap wine, peanuts, about \u00a320 in cash and their travelling expenses. They might be asked anything from their views on a new advertising campaign to why they prefer one particular brand of orange juice to another. \"Focus groups are a great weapon and a very dangerous one,\" says Lauffer. One of the problems is that too much can be read into what people say. \"Take Carly here - we don't know how much of it she is making up to show off, or if it is actually true.\" Gordon agrees. \"People don't always mean what they say or say what they mean.\" She says some people will say what they think the questioner wants to hear, others will make things up, some are too intimidated to voice an opinion and some groups will be dominated by one person. Then there are the focus groupies - people who attend over and over again, says Janet Grimes, head of planning at another advertising agency, Ogilvy &amp; Mather. \"They are difficult to spot because they have been coached by the recruiter and told not to let on that they have been to a group before. Some do it for the money, some because they want a soapbox or feel flattered that companies are interested in their opinions.\" John Simms (not his real name) is a self-confessed focus groupie. \"Basically, I know someone who recruits for focus groups and I do it for the money,\" he says. \"I'm a mature student but I've pretended to be an internet entrepreneur and all sorts of other things. They offer between \u00a320 and \u00a350 for a couple of hours of chat. I've talked about cars, although I can't drive, and mobile phones, although I haven't got one. I've also done drinks and bank accounts. It's easy. Some of them provide decent wine and food and it's a bit of a laugh making up opinions.\" However, Grimes warns that focus groupies soon begin to give themselves away: \"They start to use marketing language and jargon that they wouldn't really know unless they did a lot of focus groups.\" Aware of this, advertising agencies are turning to new techniques. Beware researchers bearing cameras - like the makers of Big Brother, they want to know the most intimate details of your life, but only so they can sell you more beer, soap or mar garine. We have progressed beyond the idea that people are laboratory rats to be observed from behind a one-way mirror or that they will give you any real insight in a cocktail party setting,\" says Gordon. \"We like to see people in context - so if they are shopping in the supermarket, then we film them doing it.\" For one toiletries manufacturer, for example, Gordon's company filmed people in the shower to find out how they felt about the product they were using. \"Focus groups can be pretty artificial. We like to talk to people in their own homes,\" confirms Lauffer. If she is interested in issues of self-image, for example, she will ask people to put on an impromptu fashion show in their bedrooms. \"I say, 'Show me what you would wear if you were meeting an ex-boyfriend'. They love it because I'm really interested in what they have to say and they get between \u00a350 and \u00a3100 for their time.\" She adds that the secret of really understanding consumers is to be a \"strategic snooper\". \"I know that if I'm going to talk to people about their eating habits, then they will have thrown all the junk out of the fridge, so I have to go through their bins to get the real picture.\" Siamack Salari, who runs a research organisation called the Culture Lab, goes a step further: he spends days filming people in their own homes.

      "body": "<p>A pledge to extend maternity rights to every woman in full-time employment will be included in Labour's election manifesto as the party promises to deliver the most sweeping changes to parental rights since the second world war.</p> <p>Downing Street and the treasury have thrown their collective weight behind the reform, which will step up the fight against child poverty by ensuring that no mother is denied full maternity rights.</p> <p>The proposal will be one of the main recommendations of a ministerial review group which is examining ways of improving parental rights. Ministers will also recommend extending maternity leave from the current 18 weeks - possibly to a year - and increasing the weekly flat rate statutory maternity pay of \u00a360.20, possibly to \u00a3100.</p> <p>Ministers on the special cross-departmental group are determined to ensure that their reforms do not just benefit middle-class parents but are aimed at mothers across the board.</p> <p>One of their proposals will ensure that women who do not earn enough to merit statutory maternity pay (SMP) will win the right to the weekly payment. Women who have not met the strict criteria for maternity rights - they have to be in full-time employment for 11 weeks before the start of pregnancy - will also receive SMP.</p> <p>One minister on the review group said the government was concerned that women who lose out on maternity rights tend to slip out of the employment market after the birth of their child.</p> <p>\"We are very concerned that the less well paid do not have any maternity provision,\" the minister said. \"They are more likely to leave work altogether and go back into benefits. If we are to tackle child poverty, we must keep mothers connected with work.\"</p> <p>The reform will build on reforms introduced by Gordon Brown in 1999 when he lowered the threshold to women earning between \u00a330 and \u00a360 a week. The review will recommend the abolition of the threshold, benefiting thousands of women.</p> <p>The chancellor set up the parental review group because maternity pay has fallen in real terms in the past 10 years and is now less than half the EU average. Women currently receive 90% of their pay for the first six weeks of maternity leave. This is reduced to a flat rate of \u00a360.20 for the next 12 weeks.</p> <p>The government's reforms will include:</p> <p>\u0095 Extending the period of statutory maternity leave from 18 weeks, possibly to a year</p> <p>\u0095 Increasing the weekly flat rate SMP payment of \u00a360.20.

      "bodyText": "A pledge to extend maternity rights to every woman in full-time employment will be included in Labour's election manifesto as the party promises to deliver the most sweeping changes to parental rights since the second world war. Downing Street and the treasury have thrown their collective weight behind the reform, which will step up the fight against child poverty by ensuring that no mother is denied full maternity rights. The proposal will be one of the main recommendations of a ministerial review group which is examining ways of improving parental rights. Ministers will also recommend extending maternity leave from the current 18 weeks - possibly to a year - and increasing the weekly flat rate statutory maternity pay of \u00a360.20, possibly to \u00a3100. Ministers on the special cross-departmental group are determined to ensure that their reforms do not just benefit middle-class parents but are aimed at mothers across the board. One of their proposals will ensure that women who do not earn enough to merit statutory maternity pay (SMP) will win the right to the weekly payment. Women who have not met the strict criteria for maternity rights - they have to be in full-time employment for 11 weeks before the start of pregnancy - will also receive SMP. One minister on the review group said the government was concerned that women who lose out on maternity rights tend to slip out of the employment market after the birth of their child. \"We are very concerned that the less well paid do not have any maternity provision,\" the minister said. \"They are more likely to leave work altogether and go back into benefits. If we are to tackle child poverty, we must keep mothers connected with work.\" The reform will build on reforms introduced by Gordon Brown in 1999 when he lowered the threshold to women earning between \u00a330 and \u00a360 a week. The review will recommend the abolition of the threshold, benefiting thousands of women. The chancellor set up the parental review group because maternity pay has fallen in real terms in the past 10 years and is now less than half the EU average. Women currently receive 90% of their pay for the first six weeks of maternity leave. This is reduced to a flat rate of \u00a360.20 for the next 12 weeks. The government's reforms will include: \u0095 Extending the period of statutory maternity leave from 18 weeks, possibly to a year \u0095 Increasing the weekly flat rate SMP payment of \u00a360.20. This could be graded \u0095 Giving fathers two weeks paid parental leave immediately after the birth of their child \u0095 Offering help to mothers who want to work from home after the birth of their child. The trade and industry secretary, Stephen Byers, whose department is leading the ministerial review, said the government \"can and should\" do more. \"We want all parents to be able to balance more easily the demands of work with caring for their children,\" he told the Guardian. Ministers on the review group are determined to win over business leaders, such as the Confederation of British Industry, who have issued dire threats of the dangers of imposing more regulations. However, business will not be given a veto. Mr Byers, who will speak about the parental rights review in his speech at the Labour conference today, said: \"Our present discussions and consultations are aimed at achieving a broad consensus for a package which [provides] real choice for parents whilst at the same time not adversely affecting the competitiveness of business.\" Ministers will tell business that it is in their interests to improve maternity rights to ensure that skilled women return to the labour market. Ministers have been impressed by the generous scheme offered by Boots which ensures that 80% of women return to work after pregnancy.

Sometimes ahead of the curve: Michigan abolished capital punishment in 1846, well before most of Europe; Rhode Island and Wisconsin got rid of it in 1853; North Dakota has never had it; sometimes a bit behind: seven out of nine states that had abandoned it embraced it again in the decades after the Great War and the Bolshevik Revolution; sometimes - as in its tacit acceptance of lynching and of the quasi-judicial hangings which gave mob murder a veneer of legitimacy - horribly out of step. But basically part of the pack and notably so in the shadow of the Holocaust. </p> <p>Annual numbers of executions declined steadily after 1945 and by the early 1960s were barely a fifth of what they had been before the war. In 1965 - the year Britain abolished the death penalty - there were seven, compared, for example, to almost two hundred a year during the 1930s. There were two in 1966; one the year after; then none at all, and no further executions in the five years preceding the Supreme Court's decision in the Furman v. Georgia case of 1972, which seemed to end capital punishment for good. In fact, it did nothing of the sort.</p> <p>Henry Furman was a slightly retarded black man who had shot and killed a householder through a closed door in the course of a burglary and was now facing the electric chair in Georgia. He had the good fortune to be represented on appeal by Anthony Amsterdam, a learned and rhetorically gifted Stanford law professor. His argument before the Supreme Court not only saved his client's life but irrevocably changed the history of the death penalty in America, if not exactly as he might have hoped. (Furman was paroled in 1984; he now works in construction.)</p> <p>Amsterdam was, and is, a passionate opponent of capital punishment under any circumstances, however refined its procedures: contemporary jurisprudence which tries to rationalise the death penalty 'offends humanity and reason', he wrote recently. But in 1972 the majority of the Court did not go nearly so far. Five of the nine Justices agreed that capital punishment as then practised constituted 'cruel and unusual punishment' but only three would have purged the modifier 'as then practised' and ruled capital punishment itself to be 'cruel and unusual'.</p> <p>In Furman's case only William Brennan and Thurgood Marshall, the Court's one black member, voted to strike down nearly all existing capital statutes on the grounds that they were intrinsically in violation of human rights or communal dignity. As Marshall put it in another case, judicial murder is 'obviously no less shocking than the crime itself . . . and adds a second defilement to the first'. Justice William Douglas came close. He saw Furman's conviction as invalid because it was 'pregnant with discrimination' and because, more generally, a sort of moral evolution had brought society to a point where the death penalty - like branding, torture and public whipping before it - was no longer to be regarded as civilised. Historically new standards made it 'cruel and unusual' and hence unconstitutional. But the other two Justices voted with the majority on procedural grounds and it is their views which precipitated the very odd discussion in which we in the US are engaged today.</p> <p>One of them, Justice Potter Stewart, held that Furman's punishment would be 'cruel and unusual' as a matter of statistical observation: to find oneself the one man to be executed out of several thousand who were eligible was 'cruel and unusual' in the same sense as 'being struck by lightning was cruel and unusual'. The problem was not a violation of human rights but of too much being left to chance. There was, as the fifth member of the majority held, no 'meaningful basis' for deciding who would die and who would not. And so capital punishment was declared unconstitutional largely because of the way it was then practised.</p> <p>The story might have ended there. Instead, 38 state legislatures provided what they took to be a rationale for executing some and not other criminals. Finally, in 1976, a case went up to the Supreme Court - from Georgia - testing whether states had, in principle, succeeded in providing such a rationale. Specifically, the question in the case of Troy Gregg was whether Georgia had provided sufficient guidance to the sentencing authority - the jury in this case - to ensure that its discretion would be sufficiently 'channelled'. If in Furman the Court ruled that there was at the time no rational basis for distinguishing those who would and those who would not face execution, in Gregg they decided that at least one state had succeeded in providing the required rationale. The prosecution would have to convince a jury that there was 'at least one statutory aggravating factor before it [might] impose a penalty of death' and that there was a preponderance of aggravating over mitigating factors before it actually passed a sentence of death. Yes, the court held in the Gregg case, Georgia - and by extension other states which passed similar statutes - had circumscribed chance sufficiently for capital punishment now to pass Constitutional muster.</p> <p>Furman had resulted in five years of de facto abolition. Then, in 1977, came the execution in Utah of Gary Gilmore, a theatrically brilliant criminal and the subject of one of the great pieces of modern American writing, Norman Mailer's The Executioner's Song. Gilmore forswore further appeals and faced the firing squad wearing his famously indestructible Timex watch: scarcely typical and followed by a mere trickle of other deaths. There were no executions in 1978 or 1980, one in 1981, the year France abandoned capital punishment. If not de jure, then de facto, the United States seemed to have abandoned this, the most ancient and most terrible of punishments.</p> <p>By the beginning of Ronald Reagan's second term, in 1984, however, something seems to have gone horribly wrong, or deliciously right, depending on one's point of view. The US struck out away from Western democracies and found itself in very strange company indeed. The average annual execution rate increased from 23 between 1984 and the end of 1994 to 80 in the last three years of the millennium. As of 23 August this year, there have been 660 executions since the resumption of the death penalty in 1976.</p> <p>While no European country has reinstated it after once abandoning it, and abolition has been enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights - a marker of a civilised polity - the former leader of the free world seems to have joined a small handful of unlikely companions (China, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Iraq among them) by enthusiastically re-embracing it. (The company is even more exclusive when it comes to the execution of juveniles: China gave it up in 1997 and over the last decade the United States has more such deaths to its credit than the seven other countries that permit it combined.) That an issue seemingly settled almost everywhere else should re-emerge with such vigour and emotional intensity in the US at the start of the 21st century is curious, to say the least. </p> <p>Modern discussion of capital punishment - and of criminal law reform more generally - begins in 1764, when Cesare Beccaria, a 26-year-old Italian nobleman, published his first book, Dei delitti e delle pene (An Essay on Crimes and Punishments). The debates today are often only thinly veil\"ed rehearsals of arguments - and counter-arguments - he inspired. </p> <p>Beccaria elaborated two theses which together made abolition of the death penalty a sign of progress from superstition and savagery to enlightenment and civilisation. The first thesis is broadly speaking moral, and anti-theological, with an empirical twist: the purpose of punishment, he said, is not vengeance - or what is spoken of today as 'retribution' - nor is it an exemplary affirmation of moral norms. Rather, it is the reformation of the criminal and the prevention of future crimes: in short, deterrence and the maintenance of public safety. Punishment of this sort would have to be carefully calibrated to meet these specific, utilitarian criteria - which capital punishment manifestly did not do. Killing a criminal obviously made his reformation impossible. And moreover, it was excessive. (I use 'his' because, at least since the 18th century and in most jurisdictions, men have been overwhelmingly the objects of judicial death.) </p> <p>Punishment demanded proportionality and equity: equal punishment, predictably rendered, for equal crimes in the interests of clearly defined utilitarian ends. This meant, in the first place, that at least one old regime justification - that the execution of a certain number of criminals serve as an example to the community and as confirmation of its core values - would have to be abandoned. No one in colonial America or 18th-century England argued that a life was somehow a proportionate price to pay for a four shilling larceny or for the few bedsheets and candlesticks with which some hapless burglar might nearly have escaped. Yet almost half of those hanged in Pennsylvania during the Revolutionary decade died for such property crimes; as late as the early 19th century fewer than a quarter of the executions in England were for murder or attempted murder. The life of the criminal was forfeited - 'sacrificed' was the 18th-century term - 'to the laws of his country', which enshrined the sanctity of property, or of a man's home, or of paper money or of normative sexuality. These were worth someone dying for and a number of thieves, burglars, forgers, sodomites and rapists were hanged because, it was felt, only death could confirm the foundational values which their crimes violated.</p> <p>The persuasiveness of the argument that capital punishment is too blunt and too savage - more than is necessary to ensure the safety of the community, less than is needed to prevent similar crimes in the future - depends to some extent on the answer to an empirically decidable question: does the death penalty, as opposed to other ways of keeping a criminal off the streets, prevent crime? The matter has been debated, with ever increasing mathematical sophistication but in more or less the same terms, from the 18th century to the present, and the answer is by now fairly clear. It does not. But no one really cares today because the premise which led to the question - that punishment should serve primarily as an exercise in prevention - has been almost entirely abandoned by proponents of the death penalty. Were deterrence the issue, executions would long ago have given way to other, less fraught ways of keeping criminals from doing further harm. Clearly much more is at stake. </p> <p>Beccaria and those who followed in his tradition of Enlightenment thinking understood abolition to be part of a more general project of political and cultural regeneration. Civil government, Beccaria argued, as did the Founding Fathers, was based on a social contract under whose terms human beings had not ceded their rights in their lives and bodies to the State. Citizens or their representatives might consent to go to war - risking death to defend the State against those who would injure it - but not, Beccaria concluded, to being hanged. Except by committing treason no one could forfeit this basic 'human right'. This new regime of rights stood in sharp contrast to unenlightened polities where there was no civil contract and where to be sovereign meant precisely to exercise unlimited authority over the bodies of subjects. Torture and various acts of making such power felt in the flesh - drawings and quarterings, branding and whipping, theatrical public executions - which characterised punishment in most of Europe in the 18th century were understood to be exemplary displays. </p> <p>In Beccaria's view, backwardness in punishment thus mirrored political backwardness more generally: 'countries notorious for the severity of punishments were also those in which the most bloody and inhuman actions... were committed.' In other words, the death penalty was deeply old-fashioned, a left-over from an earlier, more savage era in the history of mankind. Thinking about it was from the beginning a way of thinking about the nature of political society and moral community. It was not primarily an empirical question.</p> <p>The Essay on Crimes and Punishments was immensely influential in British reforming circles and even more so among their Revolutionary American cousins. Thomas Jefferson regarded it as belonging with the handful of books essential for understanding the new forms of civil government being built in America. Capital punishment was not abolished in any of the new American jurisdictions, despite the efforts of some of the Founding Fathers, but penal codes were dramatically revised and made self-consciously less bloody than those of the mother country. The Eighth Amendment to the US Constitution prohibiting 'cruel and unusual punishment' is another sign of the Founding Fathers' commitment to the idea that a new sort of liberal polity demanded the rejection of absolutist forms of punishment. (The French Constitution of 1791, which created a short-lived constitutional monarchy, got rid of the death penalty entirely except for treason.) </p> <p>By the middle years of the 19th century, the debate on capital punishment in the US had a more explicitly republican tone and a stronger religious content than could have been envisaged by Beccaria. But the connection between a progressive view of history based on the expansion of individual human rights and opposition to capital punishment remained strong. Theologically, too, opponents of the gallows tended to be optimistic in their view of salvation: Congregationalists or Unitarians, as against evangelicals or Calvinist Presbyterians - people more attracted to notions of redemption than of atonement, to the image of a merciful rather than a vengeful God. For them, the link between the moral government of God and the earthly city did not need to be so close. Theirs was basically a secular culture of republican reform; the human condition could be improved here on earth. Thus, the campaign for abolition was linked with other progressive causes: amelioration of the conditions of the insane, for example, and, most important, anti-slavery. To these 19th-century reformers hanging, like chattel slavery, represented a brutal, indefensible affront to human dignity. In Proximity to Death William McFeely makes the connection between then and now explicit: 'opposition to the death penalty today,' he says, 'is the contemporary equivalent of abolitionism.' Stephen Bright, the lead counsel at the Southern Center for Human Rights, whose archives were the starting point for McFeely's exploration of the way capital punishment actually works, sees himself as belonging to a tradition that goes back to the early days of the Republic.</p> <p>One has to infer the arguments put by the other side, or look elsewhere (to Louis Masur's 1989 Rites of Execution, for example). There we will find those who have been less sanguine about human progress and the efficacy of social reform, those who think that punishment ought to reflect a divine and intuitively obvious moral order. Human depravity, on this view, makes it necessary for civil government to assume the power of divine authority. Liberty, inalienable individual rights, procedural correctness and hopes for reformation or redemption have to be balanced against obligation, against the needs of a righteous community, and against the feeling that, social contract or no social contract, for civil government to be legitimate it has somehow to be congruent with God's governance. In other words, a government here on earth can cast out and kill certain of its citizens under certain circumstances because God in heaven has ordained that this should be so. Capital punishment is the expression of both divine and communal outrage at those who have excluded themselves from full humanity through their acts. Although this view was not articulated in defences of the death penalty after the early 19th century, capital punishment retains something of its primordial sacrificial logic. Killing an offender is felt to make the world safer, more as it should be, for the good people, even if no connection is made, or claimed, at the level of social policy between the act and its putative effects. Seen in this way, as a ritual reassertion of a communal moral order, the death penalty has little to do with ideas of punishment in the rationalist Enlightenment or progressive theological traditions.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/lrb/articles/0,6109,374576,00.html\">Continued in part 2</a></p>",

Sometimes ahead of the curve: Michigan abolished capital punishment in 1846, well before most of Europe; Rhode Island and Wisconsin got rid of it in 1853; North Dakota has never had it; sometimes a bit behind: seven out of nine states that had abandoned it embraced it again in the decades after the Great War and the Bolshevik Revolution; sometimes - as in its tacit acceptance of lynching and of the quasi-judicial hangings which gave mob murder a veneer of legitimacy - horribly out of step. But basically part of the pack and notably so in the shadow of the Holocaust. Annual numbers of executions declined steadily after 1945 and by the early 1960s were barely a fifth of what they had been before the war. In 1965 - the year Britain abolished the death penalty - there were seven, compared, for example, to almost two hundred a year during the 1930s. There were two in 1966; one the year after; then none at all, and no further executions in the five years preceding the Supreme Court's decision in the Furman v. Georgia case of 1972, which seemed to end capital punishment for good. In fact, it did nothing of the sort. Henry Furman was a slightly retarded black man who had shot and killed a householder through a closed door in the course of a burglary and was now facing the electric chair in Georgia. He had the good fortune to be represented on appeal by Anthony Amsterdam, a learned and rhetorically gifted Stanford law professor. His argument before the Supreme Court not only saved his client's life but irrevocably changed the history of the death penalty in America, if not exactly as he might have hoped. (Furman was paroled in 1984; he now works in construction.) Amsterdam was, and is, a passionate opponent of capital punishment under any circumstances, however refined its procedures: contemporary jurisprudence which tries to rationalise the death penalty 'offends humanity and reason', he wrote recently. But in 1972 the majority of the Court did not go nearly so far. Five of the nine Justices agreed that capital punishment as then practised constituted 'cruel and unusual punishment' but only three would have purged the modifier 'as then practised' and ruled capital punishment itself to be 'cruel and unusual'. In Furman's case only William Brennan and Thurgood Marshall, the Court's one black member, voted to strike down nearly all existing capital statutes on the grounds that they were intrinsically in violation of human rights or communal dignity. As Marshall put it in another case, judicial murder is 'obviously no less shocking than the crime itself . . . and adds a second defilement to the first'. Justice William Douglas came close. He saw Furman's conviction as invalid because it was 'pregnant with discrimination' and because, more generally, a sort of moral evolution had brought society to a point where the death penalty - like branding, torture and public whipping before it - was no longer to be regarded as civilised. Historically new standards made it 'cruel and unusual' and hence unconstitutional. But the other two Justices voted with the majority on procedural grounds and it is their views which precipitated the very odd discussion in which we in the US are engaged today. One of them, Justice Potter Stewart, held that Furman's punishment would be 'cruel and unusual' as a matter of statistical observation: to find oneself the one man to be executed out of several thousand who were eligible was 'cruel and unusual' in the same sense as 'being struck by lightning was cruel and unusual'. The problem was not a violation of human rights but of too much being left to chance. There was, as the fifth member of the majority held, no 'meaningful basis' for deciding who would die and who would not. And so capital punishment was declared unconstitutional largely because of the way it was then practised. The story might have ended there. Instead, 38 state legislatures provided what they took to be a rationale for executing some and not other criminals. Finally, in 1976, a case went up to the Supreme Court - from Georgia - testing whether states had, in principle, succeeded in providing such a rationale. Specifically, the question in the case of Troy Gregg was whether Georgia had provided sufficient guidance to the sentencing authority - the jury in this case - to ensure that its discretion would be sufficiently 'channelled'. If in Furman the Court ruled that there was at the time no rational basis for distinguishing those who would and those who would not face execution, in Gregg they decided that at least one state had succeeded in providing the required rationale. The prosecution would have to convince a jury that there was 'at least one statutory aggravating factor before it [might] impose a penalty of death' and that there was a preponderance of aggravating over mitigating factors before it actually passed a sentence of death. Yes, the court held in the Gregg case, Georgia - and by extension other states which passed similar statutes - had circumscribed chance sufficiently for capital punishment now to pass Constitutional muster. Furman had resulted in five years of de facto abolition. Then, in 1977, came the execution in Utah of Gary Gilmore, a theatrically brilliant criminal and the subject of one of the great pieces of modern American writing, Norman Mailer's The Executioner's Song. Gilmore forswore further appeals and faced the firing squad wearing his famously indestructible Timex watch: scarcely typical and followed by a mere trickle of other deaths. There were no executions in 1978 or 1980, one in 1981, the year France abandoned capital punishment. If not de jure, then de facto, the United States seemed to have abandoned this, the most ancient and most terrible of punishments. By the beginning of Ronald Reagan's second term, in 1984, however, something seems to have gone horribly wrong, or deliciously right, depending on one's point of view. The US struck out away from Western democracies and found itself in very strange company indeed. The average annual execution rate increased from 23 between 1984 and the end of 1994 to 80 in the last three years of the millennium. As of 23 August this year, there have been 660 executions since the resumption of the death penalty in 1976. While no European country has reinstated it after once abandoning it, and abolition has been enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights - a marker of a civilised polity - the former leader of the free world seems to have joined a small handful of unlikely companions (China, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Iraq among them) by enthusiastically re-embracing it. (The company is even more exclusive when it comes to the execution of juveniles: China gave it up in 1997 and over the last decade the United States has more such deaths to its credit than the seven other countries that permit it combined.) That an issue seemingly settled almost everywhere else should re-emerge with such vigour and emotional intensity in the US at the start of the 21st century is curious, to say the least. Modern discussion of capital punishment - and of criminal law reform more generally - begins in 1764, when Cesare Beccaria, a 26-year-old Italian nobleman, published his first book, Dei delitti e delle pene (An Essay on Crimes and Punishments). The debates today are often only thinly veil\"ed rehearsals of arguments - and counter-arguments - he inspired. Beccaria elaborated two theses which together made abolition of the death penalty a sign of progress from superstition and savagery to enlightenment and civilisation. The first thesis is broadly speaking moral, and anti-theological, with an empirical twist: the purpose of punishment, he said, is not vengeance - or what is spoken of today as 'retribution' - nor is it an exemplary affirmation of moral norms. Rather, it is the reformation of the criminal and the prevention of future crimes: in short, deterrence and the maintenance of public safety. Punishment of this sort would have to be carefully calibrated to meet these specific, utilitarian criteria - which capital punishment manifestly did not do. Killing a criminal obviously made his reformation impossible. And moreover, it was excessive. (I use 'his' because, at least since the 18th century and in most jurisdictions, men have been overwhelmingly the objects of judicial death.) Punishment demanded proportionality and equity: equal punishment, predictably rendered, for equal crimes in the interests of clearly defined utilitarian ends. This meant, in the first place, that at least one old regime justification - that the execution of a certain number of criminals serve as an example to the community and as confirmation of its core values - would have to be abandoned. No one in colonial America or 18th-century England argued that a life was somehow a proportionate price to pay for a four shilling larceny or for the few bedsheets and candlesticks with which some hapless burglar might nearly have escaped. Yet almost half of those hanged in Pennsylvania during the Revolutionary decade died for such property crimes; as late as the early 19th century fewer than a quarter of the executions in England were for murder or attempted murder. The life of the criminal was forfeited - 'sacrificed' was the 18th-century term - 'to the laws of his country', which enshrined the sanctity of property, or of a man's home, or of paper money or of normative sexuality. These were worth someone dying for and a number of thieves, burglars, forgers, sodomites and rapists were hanged because, it was felt, only death could confirm the foundational values which their crimes violated. The persuasiveness of the argument that capital punishment is too blunt and too savage - more than is necessary to ensure the safety of the community, less than is needed to prevent similar crimes in the future - depends to some extent on the answer to an empirically decidable question: does the death penalty, as opposed to other ways of keeping a criminal off the streets, prevent crime? The matter has been debated, with ever increasing mathematical sophistication but in more or less the same terms, from the 18th century to the present, and the answer is by now fairly clear. It does not. But no one really cares today because the premise which led to the question - that punishment should serve primarily as an exercise in prevention - has been almost entirely abandoned by proponents of the death penalty. Were deterrence the issue, executions would long ago have given way to other, less fraught ways of keeping criminals from doing further harm. Clearly much more is at stake. Beccaria and those who followed in his tradition of Enlightenment thinking understood abolition to be part of a more general project of political and cultural regeneration. Civil government, Beccaria argued, as did the Founding Fathers, was based on a social contract under whose terms human beings had not ceded their rights in their lives and bodies to the State. Citizens or their representatives might consent to go to war - risking death to defend the State against those who would injure it - but not, Beccaria concluded, to being hanged. Except by committing treason no one could forfeit this basic 'human right'. This new regime of rights stood in sharp contrast to unenlightened polities where there was no civil contract and where to be sovereign meant precisely to exercise unlimited authority over the bodies of subjects. Torture and various acts of making such power felt in the flesh - drawings and quarterings, branding and whipping, theatrical public executions - which characterised punishment in most of Europe in the 18th century were understood to be exemplary displays. In Beccaria's view, backwardness in punishment thus mirrored political backwardness more generally: 'countries notorious for the severity of punishments were also those in which the most bloody and inhuman actions... were committed.' In other words, the death penalty was deeply old-fashioned, a left-over from an earlier, more savage era in the history of mankind. Thinking about it was from the beginning a way of thinking about the nature of political society and moral community. It was not primarily an empirical question. The Essay on Crimes and Punishments was immensely influential in British reforming circles and even more so among their Revolutionary American cousins. Thomas Jefferson regarded it as belonging with the handful of books essential for understanding the new forms of civil government being built in America. Capital punishment was not abolished in any of the new American jurisdictions, despite the efforts of some of the Founding Fathers, but penal codes were dramatically revised and made self-consciously less bloody than those of the mother country. The Eighth Amendment to the US Constitution prohibiting 'cruel and unusual punishment' is another sign of the Founding Fathers' commitment to the idea that a new sort of liberal polity demanded the rejection of absolutist forms of punishment. (The French Constitution of 1791, which created a short-lived constitutional monarchy, got rid of the death penalty entirely except for treason.) By the middle years of the 19th century, the debate on capital punishment in the US had a more explicitly republican tone and a stronger religious content than could have been envisaged by Beccaria. But the connection between a progressive view of history based on the expansion of individual human rights and opposition to capital punishment remained strong. Theologically, too, opponents of the gallows tended to be optimistic in their view of salvation: Congregationalists or Unitarians, as against evangelicals or Calvinist Presbyterians - people more attracted to notions of redemption than of atonement, to the image of a merciful rather than a vengeful God. For them, the link between the moral government of God and the earthly city did not need to be so close. Theirs was basically a secular culture of republican reform; the human condition could be improved here on earth. Thus, the campaign for abolition was linked with other progressive causes: amelioration of the conditions of the insane, for example, and, most important, anti-slavery. To these 19th-century reformers hanging, like chattel slavery, represented a brutal, indefensible affront to human dignity. In Proximity to Death William McFeely makes the connection between then and now explicit: 'opposition to the death penalty today,' he says, 'is the contemporary equivalent of abolitionism.' Stephen Bright, the lead counsel at the Southern Center for Human Rights, whose archives were the starting point for McFeely's exploration of the way capital punishment actually works, sees himself as belonging to a tradition that goes back to the early days of the Republic. One has to infer the arguments put by the other side, or look elsewhere (to Louis Masur's 1989 Rites of Execution, for example). There we will find those who have been less sanguine about human progress and the efficacy of social reform, those who think that punishment ought to reflect a divine and intuitively obvious moral order. Human depravity, on this view, makes it necessary for civil government to assume the power of divine authority. Liberty, inalienable individual rights, procedural correctness and hopes for reformation or redemption have to be balanced against obligation, against the needs of a righteous community, and against the feeling that, social contract or no social contract, for civil government to be legitimate it has somehow to be congruent with God's governance. In other words, a government here on earth can cast out and kill certain of its citizens under certain circumstances because God in heaven has ordained that this should be so. Capital punishment is the expression of both divine and communal outrage at those who have excluded themselves from full humanity through their acts. Although this view was not articulated in defences of the death penalty after the early 19th century, capital punishment retains something of its primordial sacrificial logic. Killing an offender is felt to make the world safer, more as it should be, for the good people, even if no connection is made, or claimed, at the level of social policy between the act and its putative effects. Seen in this way, as a ritual reassertion of a communal moral order, the death penalty has little to do with ideas of punishment in the rationalist Enlightenment or progressive theological traditions.

      "bodyText": "China yesterday stepped up its war of words with the Vatican about the coming canonisation of Catholic martyrs whom it said deserved to die. A slow thaw in relations with the Holy See, the central administration for the Roman Catholic church worldwide, was abruptly reversed as Beijing mounted a last-minute campaign to stop Pope John Paul from making saints this Sunday of 120 western and Chinese Catholics who were killed in China between 1648 and 1930. Adding to Beijing's anger is the fact that Sunday is also China's national day, the anniversary of the date when the communists took power 51 years ago. \"This public humiliation and scorn for the Chinese people and Chinese church is something we absolutely cannot tolerate and accept,\" warned a statement from the Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association and the Chinese Catholics Bishops college, two government-run churches which Beijing uses to further its continuing feud with the Vatican. \"Some in the Holy See want to use this 'canonisation' to distort and slander history, renew control over China's Catholic church and encourage worshippers to oppose the government.\" The state-run media also publicised tough new restrictions that ban missionaries and bar foreigners from most kinds of religious activity within China. Beijing insists that the 87 Chinese and 33 missionaries who are to be made saints were either \"killed for bullying the Chinese people\" or \"executed for violating Chinese law during the invasion of China by imperialists and colonialists\", according to a foreign ministry spokesman, Sun Yuxi. Most died during the Boxer rebellion from 1898 to 1900, when bands of peasants slaughtered missionaries and their Chinese converts, prompting an invasion by British and other western armies.

Delegates' and unions' view: watch out Tony and Gordon, we're still here. \u0095 The pensions debate allowed the conference darling of the week, Lady Castle, to shine in a speech attacking the government. \u0095 Upstaged minister of the day: David Blunkett. His dull speech on education hardly packed the hall. Thursday \u0095 Only one thought on delegates' minds: going home. But first Nelson Mandela flies in from South Africa to join John Prescott. Question of the week: will he sing The Red Flag? \u0095 Upstaged ministers: Chris Smith, Stephen Byers and Nick Brown.",

But there were wide regional variations, with <a href=\"http://www.loot.com/scripts/lootsite.dll?search&amp;section=9\" target=\"_new\">Londoners</a> proving the most adventurous when it came to sex. A quarter of women in the capital have formed a romantic friendship online; of those 73% met their web paramours, with 75% of these becoming \"proper relationships\".</p> <p>3. The women surveyed, with an average age of 27, would typically devote 102 minutes a day chatting online with their love mates at work, an amount of time which may have bosses wondering about how to <a href=\"http://www.websense.com/management/news.cfm\" target=\"_new\">stamp out such abuse</a>. Yorkshire women are more conscientious about using the web at work: they are least likely to use online access at work for play or personal use and 53% of them think it might be a sackable offence.</p> <p>4. Along with email and chat rooms, internet love's traditional heart are the online dating services that have mushroomed over recent years. Practically all tastes and prejudices are catered for, from <a href=\"http://vegetarian.about.com/food/vegetarian/msubdating.htm\" target=\"_new\">vegans</a> to <a href=\"http://sites.netscape.net/ghegmann/singlechrist.html\" target=\"_new\">Christians</a> dating.</p> <p>5. Many of those who use such services have come away with stories which prompt <a href=\"http://www.cyberdatinghomepage.com/formreslt.htm\" target=\"_new\">second thoughts</a> while other <a href=\"http://www.wildxangel.com/indexnf.html\" target=\"_new\">tales</a> may make you hanker for the days of the ZX Spectrum.</p> <p>6. As ever, where there is love, marriage lurks close by. Many users, mostly men, scour the web for possible <a href=\"http://www.mailorderbrides.com/\" target=\"_new\">matrimonial</a> prospects. But, contrary to popular belief, not all spouse hunters are desperate middle-aged western men.</p> <p>7. For some communities the web has created a modern medium for traditional matchmaking. Indian <a href=\"http://matrimonials.indiainfo.com/\" target=\"_new\">marriage</a> sites offer the widespread South Asian diaspora the opportunity to find love across the world rather than just relying on mother's second cousin's best friend's son. And of course the Jewish community, with similar traditions, also have their own <a href=\"http://www.totallyjewish.com/dating/\" target=\"_new\">sites</a>.</p> <p>8.

      "bodyText": "1. One in 10 women who use the internet has had sex with a man she first met online at work, according to a new survey. Nearly a quarter of the 2,000 secretaries, executives and students questioned on the New Woman website had formed a \"romantic friendship\" over the web. 2. But there were wide regional variations, with Londoners proving the most adventurous when it came to sex. A quarter of women in the capital have formed a romantic friendship online; of those 73% met their web paramours, with 75% of these becoming \"proper relationships\". 3. The women surveyed, with an average age of 27, would typically devote 102 minutes a day chatting online with their love mates at work, an amount of time which may have bosses wondering about how to stamp out such abuse. Yorkshire women are more conscientious about using the web at work: they are least likely to use online access at work for play or personal use and 53% of them think it might be a sackable offence. 4. Along with email and chat rooms, internet love's traditional heart are the online dating services that have mushroomed over recent years. Practically all tastes and prejudices are catered for, from vegans to Christians dating. 5. Many of those who use such services have come away with stories which prompt second thoughts while other tales may make you hanker for the days of the ZX Spectrum. 6. As ever, where there is love, marriage lurks close by. Many users, mostly men, scour the web for possible matrimonial prospects. But, contrary to popular belief, not all spouse hunters are desperate middle-aged western men. 7. For some communities the web has created a modern medium for traditional matchmaking. Indian marriage sites offer the widespread South Asian diaspora the opportunity to find love across the world rather than just relying on mother's second cousin's best friend's son. And of course the Jewish community, with similar traditions, also have their own sites. 8. The blossoming of internet love has been followed by a proliferation of - what else - internet agony aunts. Teen pop queen Britney Spears was recently taken on by BBC Online to provide a wise word to adolescent worriers. 9. While the respondents in the New Woman survey were still interested in pursuing romance in the real world, internet users have eschewed flesh and blood for the new pleasures of cybersex, which allows participants to forgo the messiness of bodily fluids for the purity of electrons. 10. Adding yet another dimension to the great game of love, just as picking up in bars can lead to a drink problem, online dating can lead to internet addiction.

It belongs to the Telling Tales series which focuses on significant names from children's publishing and includes Anne Fine, Jacqueline Wilson, Michael Morpurgo and Enid Blyton. These slim books adopt a conversational tone so are not too ponderous, and they dig a little behind the celebrity fa&amp;ccedila;ade to explore family life, early influences and what makes the authors tick. JK shares a few of her innermost secrets (read it to find out!) and there's also a useful summary of the books, so it's good value both for fans and 'author projects'.<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502441763,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p> Teenage smoking is on the increase despite government deterrents and we get a timely reminder of the pros and cons in <strong>A Right To Smoke? </strong> by Emma Haughton (Watts Viewpoints, \u00a35.99).

Duffers like me think it's pure magic, but Ian Graham does a good job in dispelling the mystique and explaining the wonders of modern technology in <strong>How To Fly A 747</strong> (Walker, \u00a35.99). He addresses you, the Captain, in a direct, lively style and talks you through the excitement of taking off, keeping aloft, steering and navigating, dealing with turbulence and landing. OK, you won't be quite ready to take over the controls after reading this, but you'll be far more clued up over what's going on during your air journeys. And you also get a laminated poster of the plane and its cockpit, a booklet about aircrew and (guess what!) a cut-out model to make up yourself.</p> <p> <strong>History, horrible or otherwise </strong></p> <p> The desire to build empires and dominate others is a recurring human theme and Peter Chrisp tells the tale of one of history's most successful achievers in <strong>Alexander The Great: The Legend Of A Warrior King</strong> (Dorling Kindersley, \u00a39.99). Setting Alexander's life within the framework of Greek politics, it also gives interesting glimpses of social life at home and in the lands he conquered.

Rumour has it that we're not producing enough engineers, but the current choice of new publications includes enough 'don't just sit there' titles to help remedy the situation! Crafty activity I itched to press out the glossy coloured shapes and make up the 3-D Egyptian tomb complete with moving corpses in Mummies, and the UFO model which abducts a human at the turn of a handle in Aliens, both by Keith Newstead (Hodder, \u00a35.99). Some young friends did complete the models and they were ace! Modestly priced for such distinctive quality, including six pages of background information and cartoons. Buy another in the range at BOL More 'crafty' activity in Steve and Megumi Biddle's Underwater Origami (Red Fox, \u00a34.99), complete with tear-out sheets of coloured paper to fold when assembling the 18 aquatic models. This husband and wife team are a popular act on the book festival circuit, so don't miss their lively show if you get the chance. Buy it at BOL Book making It's interesting to contrast two new titles on book-making, both successful in their differing approach to 'learning through doing'. Make A Book by Vivien Frank and Deborah Jaffe (Frances Lincoln, \u00a37.99) has pull-out templates for six exquisite books, all reproduced from the British Library collection. This stylish and sophisticated package serves as a brief evolution of books via a Thai folding book, Japanese scroll, medieval Book of Hours, eighteenth century movable Cinderella book, flicker book and an historical newspaper. Buy it at BOL Making Books by Paul Johnson (Black, \u00a310.99) is a cross-curricular resource guide for adults. There are 30 projects outlining how five-to-11 year-olds can handcraft, illustrate and write their own novelty shaped or themed books. Johnson draws on his years of practical expertise and is thoroughly convincing about the contribution of book-making activity to children's development. Buy it at BOL More about Harry Potter The phenomenal success of Harry Potter will have youngsters clamouring for An Interview With JK Rowling by Lindsey Fraser (Mammoth, \u00a32.99). It belongs to the Telling Tales series which focuses on significant names from children's publishing and includes Anne Fine, Jacqueline Wilson, Michael Morpurgo and Enid Blyton. These slim books adopt a conversational tone so are not too ponderous, and they dig a little behind the celebrity fa&amp;ccedila;ade to explore family life, early influences and what makes the authors tick. JK shares a few of her innermost secrets (read it to find out!) and there's also a useful summary of the books, so it's good value both for fans and 'author projects'. Buy it at BOL Teenage smoking is on the increase despite government deterrents and we get a timely reminder of the pros and cons in A Right To Smoke? by Emma Haughton (Watts Viewpoints, \u00a35.99). It presents a balanced overview of this emotive issue backed up by a host of well-chosen quotes and photos from a range of sources, plus glossary, useful addresses and facts. There is plenty in here to stimulate discussion among young people and encourage them to form their own opinion. Buy it at BOL Echo bravo tango Ever wondered how planes get off the ground and what super force keeps them up there above the clouds? Duffers like me think it's pure magic, but Ian Graham does a good job in dispelling the mystique and explaining the wonders of modern technology in How To Fly A 747 (Walker, \u00a35.99). He addresses you, the Captain, in a direct, lively style and talks you through the excitement of taking off, keeping aloft, steering and navigating, dealing with turbulence and landing. OK, you won't be quite ready to take over the controls after reading this, but you'll be far more clued up over what's going on during your air journeys. And you also get a laminated poster of the plane and its cockpit, a booklet about aircrew and (guess what!) a cut-out model to make up yourself. History, horrible or otherwise The desire to build empires and dominate others is a recurring human theme and Peter Chrisp tells the tale of one of history's most successful achievers in Alexander The Great: The Legend Of A Warrior King (Dorling Kindersley, \u00a39.99). Setting Alexander's life within the framework of Greek politics, it also gives interesting glimpses of social life at home and in the lands he conquered. The DK format still has the power to excite with its outstanding visual content and densely packed captions, with the necessary index to access specific information about his ruthless leader and his plundering exploits.

But, as with all classics, each generation needs a contemporary reinterpretation, and over the years Alice has become an irresistible challenge to illustrators. The list of artists who've taken up the challenge includes Arthur Rackham, Mabel Lucie Attwell, Marie Laurencin, Ralph Steadman, Salvador Dali, Anthony Browne and Tony Ross. <br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501170465,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p> There are frequent developments in the Alice industry at all levels.

To re-illustrate Alice, an artist needs a strong sense of purpose - Helen Oxenbury's aim is 'to make it accessible to today's children' and this she achieves brilliantly (Walker, \u00a314.99). Childhood today tends to be telescoped to make way for an early adolescence - and Carroll's classic is increasingly perceived as a book for young children. </p> <p>While Tenniel's Alice has a somewhat grave demeanour accentuated by the formality of her clothing, Oxenbury shifts the whole focus of the story giving us a much younger Alice, bare-legged in plimsolls, wearing a liberatingly skimpy denim shift (from GAP, probably) that allows her a much more physical involvement with her adventures. This is a perfect book for adult and child to share; there's a picture at almost every opening and children who might have difficulty with Alice's prodigious conversational abilities will have no trouble in reading her body language. She's very much a child of today, with a touchy-feely informality that's reflected in the tactile quality of the soft pencil lines and the comfortable tones of the watercolours. <br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502318013,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p> Lisbeth Zwerger's Alice, a little older, is quite different (in an edition with The Wizard Of Oz, North/South, \u00a327.99).

Zwerger combines a delicate watercolour technique with a robust and unusual sense of composition: cropping the images with great bravado to reflect the topsy-turvy dislocations of the story; and making eloquent use of white space. </p> <p> Illustrators of the classics are inevitably influenced by the characters visualised by the original artist. Most of us could recognise Ratty, Mole and Mr Toad, but artist John Burningham took advantage the fact that he grew up without knowing<strong>The Wind In The Willows</strong>, and approached it (in 1983) with an open mind, working from a copy with the E H Shepard illustrations removed. It's out of print now, but it's curious how the wistful simplicity of his distinctive style somehow heightens the experience of reading the book.

      "bodyText": "The Wonderful World Book by Kate Petty and Jennie Maizels (Bodley Head, \u00a314.99) presents a magnificent feat of paper engineering. There are flaps, pop-ups and wheels galore to get every page moving in all directions as young fingers explore the universe and Planet Earth in all its variations. It's a great, intriguing game and an aid to learning! But be warned - fumbling oldies like me can't get the inflating pop-up globe flat again, so once released, it trails along tantalisingly on its elastic thread! Buy it at BOL Let's talk about the weather Talking of globes, Ted Dewan's fantastic creatures The Weatherbirds (Puffin, \u00a35.99) travel from Toronto to Costa Rica in an amazing airship, experiencing the extremes of weather and climate en route. OK, the storyline is a little contrived, but it provides a fun vehicle for the scientific information and experiments. An index helps you access the facts, and the stunning illustrations are of Ted's usual high standard. Buy it at BOL The Let's Explore Elements series by Henry Pluckrose (Watts, \u00a39.99) displays the sure touch you expect of such an experienced writer of information books for young children. Earth and Water worked equally well for me, offering a wide cross-section of stimulating statements on each topic. Not only do you get a very short, simple but effective text with no 'writing down' (a point made in the author's guidance notes for the adults who will share the book); you also get some stunning photos of exhibition standard - typified by the lions drinking life-giving water. Buy associated titles by Henry Pluckrose at BOL Children's rights For Every Child (Hutchinson in association with UNICEF, \u00a310.99) comes with impeccable credentials. It highlights 14 of the UN Convention's Rights of the Child, each interpreted in child-friendly language and in very different visual styles by a range of distinguished and prize-winning illustrators, including PJ Lynch, Jerry Pinkney, Rachel Isadora and Satoshi Kitamura. The full text of these UN Rights appears at the end. This deserves to be a treasured gift book for the stylish beauty of its production as well as its content. Younger readers Cars, Cars, Cars by Kathy Henderson (Frances Lincoln, \u00a34.99) gives a whistle-stop tour of motor travel, from the car factory to traffic jams. It's presented as a rhyming picture story with vividly illustrated scenes by Charlotte Hard tumbling over each page. The in-your-face style carries you breathlessly along at a hectic pace, reflecting the speed of the subject. Buy it at BOL Another one for tinies is Hannah Roche's Have You Ever Heard A Cat Purr? (Zero to Ten, \u00a37.99). It's one of a spiral-bound series with laminated pages about animal life cycles which gets the point over with a few well-chosen words and bold, warm pictures by Pierre Pratt. The end of the book is a new beginning - turn on! Buy it at BOL Two favourites by Kate Petty now issued in paperback are Sam Plants A Sunflower and Rosie Plants A Radish (Macmillan, \u00a33.99). They are a charming combination of simple storyline, attractive pictures by Axel Scheffer and the much-loved lift-the-flap element. The gardening checklist at the end summarises the steps to successful crops! Buy Rosie Plants a Radish at BOL Another welcome paperback edition is The Emperor's Egg, an outstanding natural history book by Martin Jenkins with enchanting illustrations from Jane Chapman (Walker, \u00a34.99). Buy it at BOL Some more maths The advent of the National Numeracy Hour has focused us on maths in a big way and some new titles have been published to develop and reinforce number skills. The Usborne Sticker Maths series (Usborne, \u00a32.99 each) by Fiona Watt and Rachel Wells links in closely to the national curriculum for early years and offers modestly priced personal workbooks. Children are encouraged to fill in numbers and to use the pages of stickers on the colourful puzzles and activities. The bright and cheerful contents and the \u00d4play' hook should appeal to children and parents alike. Shapes are woven cleverly into the African story A Triangle For Adaora by Ifeoma Onyefulu (Frances Lincoln, \u00a310.99). It follows the established format of this classy series - splendid coloured photos of family life which highlight African traditions, food and social life while pursuing the maths theme. Buy it at BOL A lot of poems about science The title and psychedelic cover by Harry Horse cannot fail to attract youngsters to Centrally Heated Knickers (Puffin, \u00a34.99) - they are in for a real treat when they delve inside this poetry book! Michael Rosen has surpassed himself with these 100 poems on the theme of science, technology and the environment. Kids will chortle at his anarchic view of things while teachers, parents and librarians will love it for brightening up the national curriculum! Buy it at BOL And finally, Shakespeare I was particularly impressed by Aliki's William Shakespeare And The Globe (Mammoth, \u00a35.99) which vividly captures in few words and many exquisite illustrations the Bard's life and times in Stratford and London. Presented in five Acts, it flows along seamlessly and provides a splendid introduction. This is a truly elegant and outstanding production, thanks to Aliki's distinctive talent.

Little Mouse watches the other animals putting their babies to bed and promising to care for them, and he isn't sure that Mama Mouse can offer as much. 'You're only a little mouse', he says.

      "body": "<p>Even the youngest babies need books. Why? Because books are one of the most exciting ways to introduce them to their brand new world. Whenever you can, grab a baby and a book and snuggle up ... you could start a life-long reading habit. Leave books around. Pop one in the buggy. Keep a favourite in the car. Learn nursery rhymes to sing (or mutter) at three in the morning. Prop a book up beside your baby as you spoon in the mashed banana, or when you change a nappy. Don't worry too much about the 'educational' content - time enough for that when your baby has learnt that books are FUN. And don't worry about smears and torn pages. There are some fabulous books that are a pleasure to read and tough enough to survive any amount of love, biscuit and dribble. </p> <p><strong> Books to squeeze</strong><br></p> <p><strong>Noisy Nap</strong> (words by Harry Alexander, David and Charles, \u00a34.99) can be left safely beside even the newest baby. It's a padded cloth book that rustles nicely when touched, kicked or rolled on. Your teeny one won't appreciate Rabbit's problems with crackling leaves, but she'll love Luana Rinaldo's bright colours and simple outline pictures.<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501855701,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a><br></p> <p> <strong>The Humpty Dumpty Play Book </strong>(Illustrated by Jo Brown, Ladybird, \u00a35.99) is another cloth book with no hard corners or sharp edges. You and I may not go wild for Humpty Dumpty in slippery gold knickers, but my testers did - and there's lots for tiny fat fingers to touch and feel as you point out hey diddle diddles and blackbirds in pies in this earliest of introductions to nursery rhyme characters. <br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502338992,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a><br></p> <p> <strong>Baby on the move</strong><br></p> <p> For the buggy try <strong>Rocket Bear</strong> (Katherine Redfern, Campbell Books, \u00a32.99). It's got a natty blue plastic strap to attach it to the pram, and it's a great read. There are jolly little flaps to open, but it's not the end of the world if they fall off - Rocket Bear can still fly 'Up, up and away' (good repetitive text is ideal for the very young) to stay with the moon mice. The pages are bursting with colour, and it's exactly the right size for small hands to clutch.<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501022435,00.html\">Buy other titles by Katherine Redfern at BOL</a><br></p> <p> For the car? What about<strong> Jack Rides His Scooter </strong>(Kingfisher, \u00a36.99). Rebecca Elgar's Jack may be a cuddly small white dog but every toddler immediately identifies with him and the way that he behaves. My testers adored making him fall off his scooter with a CRASH, and totally sympathised with the need for a plaster. The text is splendidly noisy with Zoom zoom zooms a plenty; there are flaps to open as well as tabs to pull; the pictures are a delight - all good stuff. <br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501255448,00.html\">Buy other titles by Rebecca Elgar at BOL</a><br></p> <p> Can't tell your concrete crusher from your wheeled excavator? Another car book that delights the mechanically minded (including grown ups) is <strong>My First Truck Book</strong> (Dorling Kindersley, \u00a34.99). If your one year old is rendered speechless with admiration at a road sweeper get this. The photographs are stunning.<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502136364,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a><br></p> <p> Three in the morning is a tough time. If nursery rhymes and songs are a distant memory refresh your ideas with <strong>Hey Diddle Diddle</strong> (Little Hippo, \u00a34.99). It's a lovely large-format board book ideal for sharing. Ailie Busby's illustrations are a treat, and her farmyard animals include the best Big Fat Hen you ever saw.

      "bodyText": "Even the youngest babies need books. Why? Because books are one of the most exciting ways to introduce them to their brand new world. Whenever you can, grab a baby and a book and snuggle up ... you could start a life-long reading habit. Leave books around. Pop one in the buggy. Keep a favourite in the car. Learn nursery rhymes to sing (or mutter) at three in the morning. Prop a book up beside your baby as you spoon in the mashed banana, or when you change a nappy. Don't worry too much about the 'educational' content - time enough for that when your baby has learnt that books are FUN. And don't worry about smears and torn pages. There are some fabulous books that are a pleasure to read and tough enough to survive any amount of love, biscuit and dribble. Books to squeeze Noisy Nap (words by Harry Alexander, David and Charles, \u00a34.99) can be left safely beside even the newest baby. It's a padded cloth book that rustles nicely when touched, kicked or rolled on. Your teeny one won't appreciate Rabbit's problems with crackling leaves, but she'll love Luana Rinaldo's bright colours and simple outline pictures. Buy it at BOL The Humpty Dumpty Play Book (Illustrated by Jo Brown, Ladybird, \u00a35.99) is another cloth book with no hard corners or sharp edges. You and I may not go wild for Humpty Dumpty in slippery gold knickers, but my testers did - and there's lots for tiny fat fingers to touch and feel as you point out hey diddle diddles and blackbirds in pies in this earliest of introductions to nursery rhyme characters. Buy it at BOL Baby on the move For the buggy try Rocket Bear (Katherine Redfern, Campbell Books, \u00a32.99). It's got a natty blue plastic strap to attach it to the pram, and it's a great read. There are jolly little flaps to open, but it's not the end of the world if they fall off - Rocket Bear can still fly 'Up, up and away' (good repetitive text is ideal for the very young) to stay with the moon mice. The pages are bursting with colour, and it's exactly the right size for small hands to clutch. Buy other titles by Katherine Redfern at BOL For the car? What about Jack Rides His Scooter (Kingfisher, \u00a36.99). Rebecca Elgar's Jack may be a cuddly small white dog but every toddler immediately identifies with him and the way that he behaves. My testers adored making him fall off his scooter with a CRASH, and totally sympathised with the need for a plaster. The text is splendidly noisy with Zoom zoom zooms a plenty; there are flaps to open as well as tabs to pull; the pictures are a delight - all good stuff. Buy other titles by Rebecca Elgar at BOL Can't tell your concrete crusher from your wheeled excavator? Another car book that delights the mechanically minded (including grown ups) is My First Truck Book (Dorling Kindersley, \u00a34.99). If your one year old is rendered speechless with admiration at a road sweeper get this. The photographs are stunning. Buy it at BOL Three in the morning is a tough time. If nursery rhymes and songs are a distant memory refresh your ideas with Hey Diddle Diddle (Little Hippo, \u00a34.99). It's a lovely large-format board book ideal for sharing. Ailie Busby's illustrations are a treat, and her farmyard animals include the best Big Fat Hen you ever saw. Don't forget to make the animal noises when you're feeling stronger. Buy it at BOL Animal magic Try monsters. Not as tough as a board book but still pretty resilient, Mara van der Meer's How Many Monsters (Frances Lincoln, \u00a39.99) is hilarious.

This is a wholly original, very sophisticated picture book for the upper end of this age range. <br></p> <p>If they like Weslandia they will love <strong>Sitting Ducks</strong> by Michael Bedard (Walker, \u00a39.99), an alligator-eat-duck fable, with bold illustrations with unusual perspectives, that charts the development of a very unusual friendship. <br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000064795,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a> <br></p> <p>Or try <strong>Clever Cat </strong>by Peter Collington (Jonathan Cape, \u00a39.99), a sideways look at our busy, busy lives told through the story of a cat who opens his own cat food, gets a front door key and starts a job but soon decides that snoozing in the sun is preferable.

Only on this particular night some of them get back into the wrong paintings. So instead of a brown, hunting dog Gainsborough's snooty Mr and Mrs Andrews end up with a small, hairy mongrel and Seurat's bathers at Asnieres don't have a little red dog with floppy ears but Madame de Pompadour's black dog with a wavy tail. The illustrations and paintings are cleverly conjoined and you don't have to know the original paintings for the story to work.

The wind threw us off course.\" Whether the accident was a result of human error or mechanical fault will be the subject of a magistrate's investigation which should be completed within the next 20 days. The final death toll may be higher than 65. Around 12 people are officially listed as missing, but the number may increase as other passengers not accounted for may have bought tickets on board the ship, and tickets had not been issued to small children. No Britons are thought to be missing. A spokeswoman for the British embassy in Greece said this morning that no British people had so far been identified among the dead. Francesca Flessati said: \"As far as I understand it we still definitely have 14 Britons who were rescued from the ship\u0085 Eight or nine bodies of the dead remain unidentified. \"That does not end the possibility that Britons sadly may have died, but certainly we have not had any reported missing so far. It actually looks a bit more reassuring this morning from the British point of view.\" She said a few of the 14 survivors had made their way to Britain, but many had stayed in Paros overnight. Meanwhile, tourists continue to arrive in Athens from Paros on extra flights put on by Olympic Airways.",

Perhaps the millennium has something to do with it; at all events, there's a wide variety of matter and treatment on offer. </p> <p> The British imagination finds the figure of King Arthur a source of inexhaustible fertility. The latest embodiment of the legend is Kevin Crossley-Holland's splendid <strong>The Seeing Stone</strong> (Orion, \u00a39.99). It has an unusual perspective: in the year 1199, Arthur de Caldicot is the younger son of the lord of the manor of Caldicot, near the Welsh border. There is a Merlin in his life: a presence both familiar and strange, deeply mistrusted by the village priest, and this Merlin gives young Arthur a black stone in which he sees the story of the legendary Arthur played out for him. The more he sees, the more their stories begin to overlap. This book (the first of a trilogy) is told in 100 very short sections, as bright and vivid as the pictures in a Book of Hours. Deep scholarship, high imagination, and great gifts of storytelling have gone into this; I was spellbound. <br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502439891,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p> Hans Magnus Enzensberger's <strong> Where Were You, Robert?</strong> (Hamish Hamilton, \u00a314.99) has found much deserved praise in Europe. Young Robert, in his early teens, has a problem with his eyes: when he looks into a picture of some scene from the past, his vision draws him into it. His journeys take him first to Communist Russia in 1956, and ultimately by a series of further picture-engulfments to a painter's studio in 17th century Holland. What I most enjoyed about this, apart from the brilliantly vivid recreations of the sights and textures and smells of the past, was Robert's matter-of fact resourcefulness in dealing with his predicament. He is realistically uneasy and afraid, but it's his own courage and skill that rescue him every time. The story plays absolutely fair, and the translation, by Anthea Bell, reads beautifully.<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502131571,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p> It's fascinating to watch an author discover where her imagination is really at home.

The children in a large Catholic family face bereavement, joy, mystery, temptation, and many other experiences, beautifully preserved and delicately rendered. Almond's well-received novels have trodden the borders of fantasy: I think he is even better with this firmly-rooted realism. He has the rare gift of being tender towards experience without either sentimentalising or indulging it; he knows that raw material has to be worked on before it becomes art, and he knows how to do it. <br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502322994,00.html\">Buy other David Almond titles at BOL</a></p> <p>Joan Lingard's <strong>Natasha's Will</strong> (Puffin, \u00a34.99) is a real old-fashioned family yarn.

It's a reputation that some of them do their best to earn: they secure your life savings by means of a hyperbolic leaflet and smooth talking, and that's the last you hear of them. Krishna Ganase of south London, for instance, paid a \u00a3273 deposit to Essex-based firm Bryco Glaze in August 1999. A survey was conducted and he was promised that his new windows would be installed within a fortnight. </p> <p>Thirteen weeks then passed in which Ganase (who had to do all the chasing) was variously told that the wooden corner sleeves he had requested were not yet available; that the company which made them had gone bust and that Bryco was trying to source them elsewhere; that no corner sleeves existed and would he accept the installation without them for a discount? He agreed, provided the job could be completed by Christmas, but was told this was impossible. A year on he's still waiting and two further letters have gone unacknowledged. </p> <p><strong> \u0095Romford Trading Standards explains that Bryco itself went into liquidation last March. BB Marketing now operates the business under the same name and, being new to the scene, shows touching signs of bashfulness. Ten weeks after Consumer first got in touch there was still no word from them. \"The person you need to speak to\" has a phone \"but not a phone number\" and therefore we can't be transferred. \"What are we to do then?\" we ask. \"I don't know,\" says our spokeswoman. By the fourth week she announces that she's \"sick and tired\" of chasing her colleagues, but still no one calls. </strong></p> <p><strong>Then, out of the blue, Ganase receives a refund but no letter of explanation or apology. That's because it's all his fault, retorts the numberless sales and marketing director who is finally coaxed to the phone. </strong></p> <p><strong>\"We told him the corner sleeves would be hard to come by but he's been very unreasonable and wouldn't negotiate. We've lost a lot of money over this and have always endeavoured to fulfil our contract.\" Ganase has since had his windows replaced without hitch by another firm.</strong> </p> <p><strong> Building trust is hard</strong><br> </p> <p> Finding a builder who can be let loose on your home for days on end and merit an outlay of thousands can be just as nerve-racking, which is why Indar Picton-Howell of London chose one from improveline.com, a website that promises a list of meticulously vetted builders for a fee of \u00a325. The result, for which he was asked to pay \u00a3750 in cash, was a disaster. He was left with an unusable kitchen, damaged furniture, an uneven ceiling and exposed wiring, and the builder demanded an additional \u00a3500 to continue. improveline.com promised to send an independent inspector round five weeks ago and Picton-Howell took the day off work, but no one turned up for the appointment. Since then, silence. </p> <p><strong> \u0095Soon after Picton-Howell's lament comes a remorseful email from improveline.com. \"There is a strong case for compensation,\" says a spokesman. \"Part of our service is to weed out unscrupulous and poorly performing tradesmen and if there is a problem - which is rare - we act quickly to sort it out. In this case a third-party administrator was involved who slowed the process down considerably. We no longer deal with them.\" improveline.com is paying for remedial work.</strong> </p> <p><strong> Online firm's apology</strong><br> </p> <p> Tim Longdon bought an MP3 player from online electrical retailer dabs.com because the website and catalogue said it would work with Windows. What it didn't say was that it will work only with Windows 98 and not with Longdon's 95 version. Not that Longdon could know this until he had started installing the software, but Dabs still said he could not have a refund because he had opened the box. \"Technical support's response was that it's well known in the industry that Windows 95 doesn't support a USB connection very well and that I should have contacted the manufacturer before buying it,\" says Longdon. \"Why should I when the catalogue specifically states that it works with Windows?\" </p> <p><strong> \u0095\"We do not sell goods on a trial basis,\" begins Dabs sniffily, pointing out that its website is only a guide. Customers, it says, should find out more information by checking the links to manufacturers' websites. But, oh dear, Dabs did just that after Consumer rang, only to find that the manufacturer doesn't specify which Windows is compatible either. It is now offering Longdon an apology and a refund, and promises to amend its site.</strong> </p> <p><strong> Disc delivery delays</strong><br> </p> <p> More on the many of you who are still awaiting free internet access from our new favourite, ntl. Earlier this month Karena Hackney of Stone, Staffordshire, was intrigued to read a spokeswoman promise on this page that \"everyone who registered in April or May should be connected by the end of August\". \"I registered on March 18 and have received nothing, despite being given 10 different deadlines,\" she says. \"The longer I'm kept waiting the more money ntl rakes in from my use of the internet. Does this disc really exist?\" Chris Arundel of Tamworth registered two days before Hackney did and is also empty-handed. \"They persuaded me to have an extra line installed to take advantage of their toll-free offer and have been charging me \u00a35 a month since, although the service has never materialised,\" he says. </p> <p>\"At one point they told me that if they let me have the disc before upgrading their system I'd cause the 999 emergency network to crash. Another time they told me I had never registered.\" </p> <p><strong> \u0095ntl, which has blamed its own success for the delays, says \"network issues\" in Hackney's and Arundel's districts have compounded the problem. It promises that discs have now been dispatched to both and that Arundel's line rental has been refunded.</strong> </p> <p><strong> Doing Oftel's job</strong><br> </p> <p> Surprisingly, given the above, David Richardson longs to join ntl's sidekick, Comtel. In fact, he wants to do what the telecoms regulator, Oftel, keeps urging customers to do - \"regulate\" poorly performing companies on its behalf by voting with his feet. </p> <p>After his BT phone was out of order for 10 days he approached Comtel, only to find that he wouldn't be allowed to keep his existing phone number. \"On pressing the matter with ntl I was told number portability is possible for a charge of \u00a350 plus VAT, but it seems they are not advertising this as they don't have the capacity to take on many new subscribers.\" </p> <p><strong> \u0095\"There does exist a very apparent price difference between Cable &amp; Wireless (\u00a34.99) and ntl (\u00a358) regarding number portability,\" says a spokeswoman, after eight weeks' reflection. \"This is due to C&amp;W having an automated system for transferring numbers whereas ntl's system is manual and requires technician support. We are currently investigating how the automated system may be integrated across the entire company.\" </strong></p> <p><strong>Since January, telecoms companies have been obliged to allow customers to take their numbers with them, but they can charge more or less what they like. \"There is no set limit, but we say it must be reasonable - say up to \u00a350 for a mobile,\" says an Oftel spokesman. Given that Oftel justifies its hands-off approach to poor service by insisting that unhappy customers should switch companies, it seems we are all to pay for the privilege of doing its job.</strong> </p> <p>Write to us at119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER, phone us on 020-7713 4731, send a fax on 020-7239 9933 or email us at <a href=\"mailto:consumer@theguardian.com\">consumer@theguardian.com</a>.</p>",

Online firm's apology Tim Longdon bought an MP3 player from online electrical retailer dabs.com because the website and catalogue said it would work with Windows. What it didn't say was that it will work only with Windows 98 and not with Longdon's 95 version. Not that Longdon could know this until he had started installing the software, but Dabs still said he could not have a refund because he had opened the box. \"Technical support's response was that it's well known in the industry that Windows 95 doesn't support a USB connection very well and that I should have contacted the manufacturer before buying it,\" says Longdon. \"Why should I when the catalogue specifically states that it works with Windows?\" \u0095\"We do not sell goods on a trial basis,\" begins Dabs sniffily, pointing out that its website is only a guide. Customers, it says, should find out more information by checking the links to manufacturers' websites. But, oh dear, Dabs did just that after Consumer rang, only to find that the manufacturer doesn't specify which Windows is compatible either. It is now offering Longdon an apology and a refund, and promises to amend its site. Disc delivery delays More on the many of you who are still awaiting free internet access from our new favourite, ntl. Earlier this month Karena Hackney of Stone, Staffordshire, was intrigued to read a spokeswoman promise on this page that \"everyone who registered in April or May should be connected by the end of August\". \"I registered on March 18 and have received nothing, despite being given 10 different deadlines,\" she says. \"The longer I'm kept waiting the more money ntl rakes in from my use of the internet. Does this disc really exist?\" Chris Arundel of Tamworth registered two days before Hackney did and is also empty-handed. \"They persuaded me to have an extra line installed to take advantage of their toll-free offer and have been charging me \u00a35 a month since, although the service has never materialised,\" he says. \"At one point they told me that if they let me have the disc before upgrading their system I'd cause the 999 emergency network to crash. Another time they told me I had never registered.\" \u0095ntl, which has blamed its own success for the delays, says \"network issues\" in Hackney's and Arundel's districts have compounded the problem. It promises that discs have now been dispatched to both and that Arundel's line rental has been refunded. Doing Oftel's job Surprisingly, given the above, David Richardson longs to join ntl's sidekick, Comtel. In fact, he wants to do what the telecoms regulator, Oftel, keeps urging customers to do - \"regulate\" poorly performing companies on its behalf by voting with his feet. After his BT phone was out of order for 10 days he approached Comtel, only to find that he wouldn't be allowed to keep his existing phone number. \"On pressing the matter with ntl I was told number portability is possible for a charge of \u00a350 plus VAT, but it seems they are not advertising this as they don't have the capacity to take on many new subscribers.\" \u0095\"There does exist a very apparent price difference between Cable &amp; Wireless (\u00a34.99) and ntl (\u00a358) regarding number portability,\" says a spokeswoman, after eight weeks' reflection. \"This is due to C&amp;W having an automated system for transferring numbers whereas ntl's system is manual and requires technician support. We are currently investigating how the automated system may be integrated across the entire company.\" Since January, telecoms companies have been obliged to allow customers to take their numbers with them, but they can charge more or less what they like. \"There is no set limit, but we say it must be reasonable - say up to \u00a350 for a mobile,\" says an Oftel spokesman. Given that Oftel justifies its hands-off approach to poor service by insisting that unhappy customers should switch companies, it seems we are all to pay for the privilege of doing its job.

Weak radio signals were pumped down from the bomb to the Shina Hospital directly below. Some signals were absorbed in the hospital's walls, but most bounced back skywards.

      "body": "<p>As a doctor, psychiatrist, psychotherapist and author, Robin Skynner, who has died aged 78, was a 20th century mental health pioneer. He contributed to major changes in clinical practice and professional training, and leaves a legacy in the practice of family, marital and group therapy, and through books like Families And How To Survive Them, which made psychology accessible to lay readers, and put analytic insights on to high street bookshop shelves.</p> <p>Skynner's mother, he recalled, worried whether he would end up a genius or a lunatic. With hindsight he realised that, lacking the resources for the first option, he spent much of his life trying to avoid the second. He ultimately compromised by entering a mental hospital through the staff entrance.</p> <p>The oldest of five sons born in Charlestown in Cornwall, Skynner's father had a family business mining and shipping china clay and his mother was a local fisherman's daughter. Educated at St Austell County School and Blundells School in Tiverton, in 1939, he volunteered for the Royal Air Force. He was commissioned and qualified as a pilot and a navigator.

      "bodyText": "As a doctor, psychiatrist, psychotherapist and author, Robin Skynner, who has died aged 78, was a 20th century mental health pioneer. He contributed to major changes in clinical practice and professional training, and leaves a legacy in the practice of family, marital and group therapy, and through books like Families And How To Survive Them, which made psychology accessible to lay readers, and put analytic insights on to high street bookshop shelves. Skynner's mother, he recalled, worried whether he would end up a genius or a lunatic. With hindsight he realised that, lacking the resources for the first option, he spent much of his life trying to avoid the second. He ultimately compromised by entering a mental hospital through the staff entrance. The oldest of five sons born in Charlestown in Cornwall, Skynner's father had a family business mining and shipping china clay and his mother was a local fisherman's daughter. Educated at St Austell County School and Blundells School in Tiverton, in 1939, he volunteered for the Royal Air Force. He was commissioned and qualified as a pilot and a navigator. He spent 30 months training pilots in Britain and Canada and then flew Mosquito fighter-bombers on low-level raids. Post-war, he qualified in medicine at University College Hospital, London, and in psychiatry at the Maudsley Hospital. There he specialised in child psychiatry. He became a consultant at Woodberry Down Child Guidance Unit and the Queen Elizabeth Hospital for Children, serving north-east London and the East End, and had a major influence introducing family therapy to Britain. He was made a member of the Royal College of Psychiatrists on its formation and was later elected a fellow.

It was found in a Victorian lead casket, inscribed with his name. It was first uncovered during excavations in the 1870s, and after it was reburied in the crypt no record of the site was kept. Its rediscovery tells us not so much of the indignity of being disinterred, as of having been forgotten in the first place. </p> <p>For if any single person invented modern journalism, it was Steele. He wrote almost all of the Tatler, published thrice weekly from 1709 to 1711. Started as a newspaper to feed the arguments of \"coffee-house politicians\", it soon became a compendium of gossip, reviews, fashionable satire and energetic moralism. </p> <p>He followed it up with the even more successful daily, the Spectator, which he wrote with his former schoolfriend Joseph Addison. Addison provided the erudition and gravitas; Steele, a true Grub Street man, contributed the swift stylistic verve. </p> <p>A \"Weekly Historian\", he plotted the ways of fashion (\"the arbiter, and rule of right\") and was the first author to make an art of writing to deadlines. He should be the secular patron saint of hacks, for he not only discovered the commercial possibilities of periodicals, he also imbued them with cultural respectability. He sold copy, and he managed to make himself a public moralist. Yet this witty, gregarious writer has slipped into something close to oblivion. He can be found in academic libraries, but not in bookshops. While every significant figure of English literature seems to have a biography written about him or her every few years, the last biography of Steele was published in 1889. </p> <p>Maybe his misfortune was to stand for values for which his contemporaries were grateful, but posterity found insufficiently colourful. As a young man he had been a soldier, fighting the French and living a dissipated life. He had even mortally wounded a fellow officer in a duel (campaigning against the fashion for duelling became one of his obsessions as a journalist). His life should be rich material for a biographer. As well as his struggles to make a living as a writer he was an MP, and often at the heart of the political controversies of his age. His knighthood (following a pattern that is still honoured) was given for his services as a political pamphleteer rather than his achievements as an anatomist of his age. </p> <p>He was also a playwright and manager of the Drury Lane theatre, though his plays, admired by contemporaries, were soon to seem too moral to be interesting. Contemporaries sometimes laughed at the gap between his enthusiasm for good behaviour and his private conviviality - what Dr Johnson called his liking for \"the lighter vices\". But his early \"irregularities\", as he called them, are what made him a promoter of urbane virtue, a man who used journalism to shape his society. </p> <p>His journalistic essays, however, have the vividness of satire rather than the weight of piety. What he condemned, he mocked, and many of his targets (the views of Tories, the behaviour of opera singers) are as satisfying now as they must have seemed when his comic portraits were first being perused, and probably read out loud, in White's Chocolate House. Steele is usually half-attracted to and half-appalled by the modern London he anatomises. This restless \"Town\" is a place where \"Gamesters, Banterers, Biters, Swearers, and Twenty new-born Insects more, are, in their several Species, the modern Men of Wit\". And modern is what Steele accepted he must be. </p> <p>Many a contemporary columnist could learn something from him of combining opinions with irony. Even while he made fun of the vanities of luxury-loving Londoners, he mocked himself for assuming a \"fantastical Dignity\" as \"Censor of Great Britain\". He was out to turn his cul ture against the alluring rakishness of the Restoration. He even celebrated domestic affections. His unguarded, funny letters to his second wife, Mary Scurlock (\"Prue\"), also unpublished since the 19th century, make a picture of a marriage that undoes preconceptions about the formality or sexism of marriages in that distant past. </p> <p>Indeed, even Steele the moralist was not such an archaic or unlikeable character. Some of the bourgeois values that he spread are (dare one say it?) dear to the hearts of many a Guardian reader. Probably his greatest influence was on sexual mores. A good deal of his wry commentaries on modern life were designed to illustrate that \"the great source of our wrong pursuits is the impertinent manner in which we treat women\". Theatre-goers and readers of fiction might like rakes, but they were the enemies of civilised life. It is odd that his satirical vignettes of sexual double standards have not been rediscovered by modern readers (or publishers). </p> <p>The discovery of the skull has an extra piquancy. Because Steele's professional life was given up to those two low but fascinating employments, journalism and politics, he breathed London air. His best writing is completely urban, as well as urbane. The index to the standard edition of the Tatler has seven pages of references to places in London: the taverns and coffee-houses where he met the \"characters\" that fill his essays; the alleys and unexpected byways that took him to the heart of a commercial metropolis. </p> <p>Yet his skull has been found in a small church in west Wales because, encumbered by debt, he had had to flee the expensive life of the metropolis. He went to live on the small estate that he had inherited from his adored wife, who had died during her fifth pregnancy. In the 18th century, Wales was where you could go to spend no money and avoid your creditors. Like his Grub Street contemporary, Richard Savage, who travelled to Wales when all his efforts at living from the pen failed, Steele's was a defeated retreat. Even before his death, he was fading from the attention of readers. His fate could stand as a lesson to authors hungry for fame: journalism might not be a good long-term prospect.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Freeserve has laid out plans to move into internet television by signing up with Bush Internet and ONdigital's ONnet. The Freeserve portal has been reformatted for clearer TV viewing and will begin to be rolled out from mid-October. Freeserve content and services will be pre-set on Bush TVs (\u00a3169.99) and set-top boxes (\u00a379.99) sold through Dixon Group stores and supermarkets, and on the ONnet home page. Analysts have welcomed the move as a positive strategy, but see it as just the start of what Freeserve has to do to make inroads into the interactive TV market. It is still early days for Bush Internet, which has managed to sell about 200,000 boxes, but is about to discover aggressive competitors in its nascent market. The ONnet partnership brings access to a potential audience of only 770,000 subscribers, with limited modem speeds and possible problems with handling Freeserve content. Analysts are slightly disappointed by subscriber numbers - about 100,000 short of forecasts - but are encouraged by portal usage, with 186.2m page impressions in August. The total number of subscribers now stands at 2.1m. The unmetered access offer has gained a strong following, with more than 250,000 subscribers now using the service. However, the results indicate that take-up of unmetered access has come from existing users rather than completely new Freeserve users.",

      "body": "<p><strong>The polar bear king, Iorek Byrnison, has entered another world to seek out his friend Lee Scoresby...</strong></p> <p>And some time later, Iorek Byrnison stepped through the blackened undergrowth and the heat-split rocks at the edge of a burnt forest. The sun was glaring through the smoky haze, but he ignored the heat as he ignored the charcoal dust that blackened his white fur and the midges that searched in vain for skin to bite.<br></p> <p> He had come a long way, and at one point in his journey, he had found himself swimming into that other world. He noticed the change in the taste of the water and the temperature of the air, but the air was still good to breathe, and the water still held his body up, so he swam on, and now he had left the sea behind, and he was nearly at the place Serafina Pekkala had described. He cast around, his black eyes gazing up at the sun-shimmering rocks of a wall of limestone crags above him. <br></p> <p> Between the edge of the burnt forest and the mountains, a rocky slope of heavy boulders and scree was littered with scorched and twisted metal: girders and struts that had belonged to some complex machine. Iorek Byrnison looked at them as a smith as well as a warrior, but there was nothing in these fragments he could use. He scored a line with a mighty claw along a strut less damaged than most, and feeling a flimsiness in the quality of the metal, turned away at once and scanned the mountain wall again.<br></p> <p> Then he saw what he was looking for: a narrow gully leading back between jagged walls, and at the entrance, a large low boulder.<br></p> <p> He clambered steadily towards it. Beneath his huge feet, dry bones snapped loudly in the stillness, because many men had died here, to be picked clean by coyotes and vultures and lesser creatures; but the great bear ignored them and stepped up carefully towards the rock. The going was loose and he was heavy, and more than once the scree shifted under his feet and carried him down again in a scramble of dust and gravel. But as soon as he slid down he began to move up once more, relentlessly, patiently, until he reached the rock itself, where the footing was firmer.<br></p> <p> The boulder was pitted and chipped with bullet-marks. Everything the witch had told him was true. And in confirmation, a little Arctic flower, a purple saxifrage, blossomed improbably where the witch had planted it as a signal in a cranny of the rock.<br></p> <p> Iorek Byrnison moved around to the upper side. It was a good shelter from an enemy below, but not good enough; for among the hail of bullets that had chipped fragments off the rock had been a few that had found their target, and that lay where they had come to rest, in the body of the man lying stiff in the shadow.<br></p> <p> He was a body, still, and not a skeleton, because the witch had laid a spell to preserve him from corruption. Iorek could see the face of his old comrade drawn and tight with the pain of his wounds, and see the jagged holes in his garments where the bullets had entered. The witch's spell did not cover the blood that must have spilled, and insects and the sun and the wind had dispersed it completely. Lee Scoresby looked not asleep, nor at peace; he looked as if he had died in battle; but he looked as if he knew that his fight had been successful. <br></p> <p>And because the Texan aeronaut was one of the very few humans Iorek had ever esteemed, he accepted the man's last gift to him. With deft movements of his claws, he ripped aside the dead man's clothes, opened the body with one slash, and began to feast on the flesh and blood of his old friend. It was his first meal for days, and he was hungry.<br></p> <p> But a complex web of thoughts was weaving itself in the bear king's mind, with more strands in it than hunger and satisfaction. There was the memory of the little girl Lyra, whom he had named Silvertongue, and whom he had last seen crossing the fragile snow-bridge across a crevasse in his own island of Svalbard. Then there was the agitation among the witches, the rumours of pacts and alliances and war; and then there was the surpassingly strange fact of this new world itself, and the witch's insistence that there were many more such worlds, and that the fate of them all hung somehow on the fate of the child. <br></p> <p>And then there was the melting of the ice. He and his people lived on the ice; ice was their home; ice was their citadel. Since the vast disturbances in the Arctic, the ice had begun to disappear, and Iorek knew that he had to find an ice-bound fastness for his kin, or they would perish. Lee had told him that there were mountains in the south so high that even his balloon could not fly over them, and they were crowned with snow and ice all year round. Exploring those mountains was his next task.<br></p> <p> But for now, something simpler possessed his heart, something bright and hard and unshakeable: vengeance. Lee Scoresby, who had rescued Iorek from danger in his balloon and fought beside him in the Arctic of his own world, had died. Iorek would avenge him. The good man's flesh and bone would both nourish him and keep him restless until blood was spilled enough to still his heart. The sun was setting as Iorek finished his meal, and the air was cooling down. After gathering the remaining fragments into a single heap, the bear lifted the flower in his mouth and dropped it in the centre of them, as humans liked to do. The witch's spell was broken now; the rest of Lee's body was free to all who came. Soon it would be nourishing a dozen different kinds of life.<br></p> <p> Then Iorek set off down the slope towards the sea again, towards the south.</p> <p>(c) Philip Pullman 2000.

The paper's lawyers threatened the BBC with a breach of copyright lawsuit after a splash on the settlement of a WPC's claims of sex discrimination was put out on Ceefax without the paper being credited. The BBC backed down with a commitment not to infringe copyright minutes before the deadline expired. The paper also reports on what it calls the \"Battle to save Nine O'clock News\" in the fallout from last week's News at Ten settlement. Press Gazette quotes shadow media secretary Peter Ainsworth, who says the BBC's plans to press ahead with moving its news to ten o'clock are \"unsustainable\". In the wake of a report last week on sales figure deception at the Birmingham Post, the paper's former editor calls for the ABC system to be scrapped in favour of a system which would include scrutiny of sales figures by inspectors. And Sunday People editor Neil Wallis has promised to continue to fight an injunction by the Ministry of Defence, banning the paper from reporting on the alleged murder of a civilian in Northern Ireland by a secret British Army unit.

      "byline": "Steven Lynch",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p> <strong>How many times have Yorkshire have won the County Championship?</strong> asks Johan Robertsson from Norway</p> <p>Since the Championship was properly constituted in 1890 Yorkshire have won it 29 times, more than any other county. That includes seven titles in the 1930s, and six in the '60s. They also shared the title once (in 1949). But, as any avid White Rose fan will tell you, they haven't won it since 1968, when Brian Close was captain. That was the last year of a hat-trick of titles, something which no county has achieved since - although Surrey will have a shot at it next year.</p> <p> <strong>I've been told that William Rodger Playle of New Zealand holds a record for slow scoring. Can you tell me some more about him?</strong> asks Valerie</p> <p>Bill Playle was a right-hand batsman from Auckland who toured England in 1958 with a New Zealand side that was largely outplayed in the Tests. He was only 20 at the time. NZ were bowled out five times for less than 100, left-arm spinner Tony Lock took 34 wickets at the startling average of 7.47, and England won the series 4-0: only rain in the final Test at The Oval prevented a probable clean sweep. Playle's long innings came in the third Test at Headingley, when he survived 194 minutes for 18 runs, including a spell of 63 minutes without adding to his score - it's one of Test cricket's slowest innings, although not quite a slow-scoring record. Apart from those five Tests, Playle only played in three more, against England at home in 1962-63, when he made his highest Test score of 65 at Wellington. He finished with 151 runs at an average of 10.06. He then moved to Perth, and played for Western Australia for three seasons. Don Cameron, Wisden Cricket Monthly's New Zealand correspondent, says: \"At last sighting, 12 months ago, Bill Playle was alive and well in Sydney. He's been there for some years after leaving Perth.\"</p> <p> <strong>Did all four Mohammad brothers ever score centuries in the same Test?</strong> asks Sheharyar Pervez</p> <p>No, they didn't - actually they never all played in the same Test team. But all four of them scored Test hundreds: Wazir, the oldest, made two in 20 Tests (1952-60), Hanif 12 from 55 (1952-69), Mushtaq 10 from 57 (1958-79), and Sadiq five from 41 (1969-80). Later Shoaib Mohammad, Hanif's son, played 45 Tests and made seven hundreds. Three of the Mohammad brothers did play together in one Test, against New Zealand at Karachi in 1969-70 - it was Sadiq's first Test and Hanif's last (Mushtaq was the other one). The only other occasions when three brothers played in the same Test were both in the 19th century. At The Oval in 1880 WG, EM and GF Grace all played for England v Australia, and at Cape Town in 1891-92 Alec and George Hearne played for England while their brother Fred turned out for South Africa.</p> <p><strong>I was surprised that Michael Atherton played in a Championship match at the end of the season, when I thought all England's contracted players were being given time off.

      "bodyText": "How many times have Yorkshire have won the County Championship? asks Johan Robertsson from Norway Since the Championship was properly constituted in 1890 Yorkshire have won it 29 times, more than any other county. That includes seven titles in the 1930s, and six in the '60s. They also shared the title once (in 1949). But, as any avid White Rose fan will tell you, they haven't won it since 1968, when Brian Close was captain. That was the last year of a hat-trick of titles, something which no county has achieved since - although Surrey will have a shot at it next year. I've been told that William Rodger Playle of New Zealand holds a record for slow scoring. Can you tell me some more about him? asks Valerie Bill Playle was a right-hand batsman from Auckland who toured England in 1958 with a New Zealand side that was largely outplayed in the Tests. He was only 20 at the time. NZ were bowled out five times for less than 100, left-arm spinner Tony Lock took 34 wickets at the startling average of 7.47, and England won the series 4-0: only rain in the final Test at The Oval prevented a probable clean sweep. Playle's long innings came in the third Test at Headingley, when he survived 194 minutes for 18 runs, including a spell of 63 minutes without adding to his score - it's one of Test cricket's slowest innings, although not quite a slow-scoring record. Apart from those five Tests, Playle only played in three more, against England at home in 1962-63, when he made his highest Test score of 65 at Wellington. He finished with 151 runs at an average of 10.06. He then moved to Perth, and played for Western Australia for three seasons. Don Cameron, Wisden Cricket Monthly's New Zealand correspondent, says: \"At last sighting, 12 months ago, Bill Playle was alive and well in Sydney. He's been there for some years after leaving Perth.\" Did all four Mohammad brothers ever score centuries in the same Test? asks Sheharyar Pervez No, they didn't - actually they never all played in the same Test team. But all four of them scored Test hundreds: Wazir, the oldest, made two in 20 Tests (1952-60), Hanif 12 from 55 (1952-69), Mushtaq 10 from 57 (1958-79), and Sadiq five from 41 (1969-80). Later Shoaib Mohammad, Hanif's son, played 45 Tests and made seven hundreds. Three of the Mohammad brothers did play together in one Test, against New Zealand at Karachi in 1969-70 - it was Sadiq's first Test and Hanif's last (Mushtaq was the other one). The only other occasions when three brothers played in the same Test were both in the 19th century. At The Oval in 1880 WG, EM and GF Grace all played for England v Australia, and at Cape Town in 1891-92 Alec and George Hearne played for England while their brother Fred turned out for South Africa. I was surprised that Michael Atherton played in a Championship match at the end of the season, when I thought all England's contracted players were being given time off. Is he no longer going on tour? asks Eddie Hewitt The only players forcibly rested from the last few Championship games were those who were selected for both the one-day and Test legs of England's pre-Christmas tours. The team departed for Kenya today (Sept 28), and the management wanted the players to be given a chance of some time off. Atherton isn't in the one-day squad, so he was allowed to play for Lancashire. Michael Vaughan also played for Yorkshire. When are England next touring Australia?

I think we were holed by a rock and floated on. There were a lot of people on the 'uphill' side of the ship as it were, wondering should we try to launch the lifeboats or wait for instructions from the crew.</p> <p>\"At a certain point we thought we needed to launch the lifeboats but at that point it was too late because the ship was tipping so far over that when they were released they didn't slide into the water. But we did actually unhook the lifeboats and I ended up on the upturned bottom of one.</p> <p>\"As the ship was finally going down, we were on the top side of the ship, I was trying to help push people upwards so they weren't [trapped] behind the railings.</p> <p>\"As it finally went down, I got hit on the head by some piece of the ship and I think perhaps trapped under one of the liferafts for about 15 seconds.</p> <p>\"I then climbed on the upturned bottom of one of the liferafts with 20 other people clinging on to the side.</p> <p>\"There were lots of small Greek boats trying to help people and pull people out of the water.</p> <p>\"A Greek guy had a lifejacket on, but let two other people swim over to him and cling on, so there were three people holding on to that lifejacket in that water for two hours and they survived.\"</p> <p>Two young British women were among survivors rescued by helicopters from aircraft carrier HMS Invincible.</p> <p>Speaking from Invincible, college friends Katrina Wallace and Nicola Gibson-Hosking spoke of their fight for survival as they clung to rocks for over three hours.</p> <p>Ms Wallace, 25, from Hertfordshire, said: \"I was on the ship and heard the crack when it hit the rock at about 10.30 at night.</p> <p>\"Luckily I found a lifeboat to get on in all this chaos of screaming people - as you would have seen on the Titanic, I guess.</p> <p>\"The lifeboat we were in had about 12 of us on at the time and there were people jumping into the sea.</p> <p>\"I was thinking we were safe in the lifeboat but we hit a rock in the middle of the sea, so we had to clamber on to this rock.</p> <p>\"The wind was hitting up and the waves were crashing on us, then the helicopter from HMS Invincible came and saved us.</p> <p>\"For three hours we held on for dear life, all terrified and cold and waiting for help. We could see boats and the island in the distance but there was nothing we could do.\"</p> <p>Ms Gibson-Hosking, from Derby, said: \"We were lucky to stay together because it was pretty mad and chaotic with everyone pushing.</p> <p>\"When the helicopter arrived we were starting to get really cold and tired and just worried in case another big wave came over and washed us off because they were coming over all the time.</p> <p>\"We just felt so, so lucky, seeing the news about the people who died.</p> <p>\"Some people jumped out of the boat in panic and I don't know what happened to them.

There were a lot of people on the 'uphill' side of the ship as it were, wondering should we try to launch the lifeboats or wait for instructions from the crew. \"At a certain point we thought we needed to launch the lifeboats but at that point it was too late because the ship was tipping so far over that when they were released they didn't slide into the water. But we did actually unhook the lifeboats and I ended up on the upturned bottom of one. \"As the ship was finally going down, we were on the top side of the ship, I was trying to help push people upwards so they weren't [trapped] behind the railings. \"As it finally went down, I got hit on the head by some piece of the ship and I think perhaps trapped under one of the liferafts for about 15 seconds. \"I then climbed on the upturned bottom of one of the liferafts with 20 other people clinging on to the side. \"There were lots of small Greek boats trying to help people and pull people out of the water. \"A Greek guy had a lifejacket on, but let two other people swim over to him and cling on, so there were three people holding on to that lifejacket in that water for two hours and they survived.\" Two young British women were among survivors rescued by helicopters from aircraft carrier HMS Invincible. Speaking from Invincible, college friends Katrina Wallace and Nicola Gibson-Hosking spoke of their fight for survival as they clung to rocks for over three hours. Ms Wallace, 25, from Hertfordshire, said: \"I was on the ship and heard the crack when it hit the rock at about 10.30 at night. \"Luckily I found a lifeboat to get on in all this chaos of screaming people - as you would have seen on the Titanic, I guess. \"The lifeboat we were in had about 12 of us on at the time and there were people jumping into the sea. \"I was thinking we were safe in the lifeboat but we hit a rock in the middle of the sea, so we had to clamber on to this rock. \"The wind was hitting up and the waves were crashing on us, then the helicopter from HMS Invincible came and saved us. \"For three hours we held on for dear life, all terrified and cold and waiting for help. We could see boats and the island in the distance but there was nothing we could do.\" Ms Gibson-Hosking, from Derby, said: \"We were lucky to stay together because it was pretty mad and chaotic with everyone pushing. \"When the helicopter arrived we were starting to get really cold and tired and just worried in case another big wave came over and washed us off because they were coming over all the time. \"We just felt so, so lucky, seeing the news about the people who died. \"Some people jumped out of the boat in panic and I don't know what happened to them. Someone tried to pass a baby down from the ship and I don't know if they got away.\"",

According to opinion polls on the last day of the six-month campaign, the Yes and No camps are neck and neck, making the result too close to call. But four of yesterday's polls found the numbers of undecided voters ranged from 4% to 12% of the 4m-strong electorate. Analysts said many of those would make their choice at the last possible moment. Underlining anxieties about the closeness of the race, advocates of the single currency quickly dismissed a report that the president of the European Central Bank (ECB), Wim Duisenberg, had warned Danish pensions would have to be reformed if the country opted into euroland. In Frankfurt, the ECB insisted that Mr Duisenberg had been misquoted in the Swiss weekly HandelsZeitung, although that mattered little to euro opponents sensing a late opportunity to gain ground. Fears that Denmark's famously generous welfare pro visions might have to be dismantled have been a central theme of the debate. Financial markets will keep a close eye on the outcome of today's vote, mindful that in April 1992 the Danish referendum on Maastricht launched a chain of events which culminated in Black Wednesday, when sterling was ejected from the exchange-rate mechanism. A No vote would be a temporary blow to the euro's credibility, although probably not its performance. The effect of such a result on the value of the euro is expected to be limited by a fresh wave of intervention by the Group of Seven industrialised nations, which last week launched a coordinated buying spree on the markets to prop up the ailing currency. But the longer-term effect could increase the likelihood of a two-speed Europe, where more integrationist-minded countries forge ahead, leaving the laggards behind. However close the result, it is clear that Denmark's No voters include less well-educated and unskilled workers, with a larger proportion of women, especially public sector employees such as nurses, teachers and welfare managers. Denmark's elite in business, politics, trade unions and the vast majority of the media want to scrap the krone and join euroland, because they say it will bring jobs, stability, growth and influence. The issue has split families and soured friendships. \"I am a Yes man but my daughter says No and the other two children are Yes and the mother is No,\" said one elderly man. \"We argue about it all the time.\" In a live television debate on Tuesday night, the leaders of the main parties urged supporters to stick with them as they pressed home their views.

      "body": "<p>The petrol crisis has prompted a serious rethink among some of Europe's motorists as they rush to escape the ever-present threat of higher prices by buying the latest models powered by fuel efficient, high performance, low emission diesel engines produced by manufacturers such as VW, Peugeot and even BMW. </p> <p>Yesterday, on the eve of the Paris motor show, analysts reported that around a third of new cars bought in Europe this year will be diesel compared with just 15% a decade ago. </p> <p>But the ramping up of crude oil prices and its impact on forecourts allied with regulations to reduce greenhouse gases has prompted both oil companies and car makers to bring forward the unthinkable: vehicles no longer fuelled by petrol or diesel but by alternative energy sources such as hydrogen - an apparently limitless and non-pollutant fuel previously thought of in connection with only nuclear or rocket technology. </p> <p>At an extraordinarily eerie filling station behind the cargo area at the Bavarian capital's airport, you can already fill up a top of the range BMW 7 series with the fuel of the future: liquid hydrogen. A robotic arm, triggered by a series of electronic messages from the dashboard and a smart payment card, glides out and fills the 750HL with up to 140 litres of liquid hydrogen - enough to travel 400km. </p> <p>The fuel is stored, at -253 C, in a tank fitted behind the rear seats that, according to Martin Geier, a BMW research executive, can withstand a full scale, rear end crash. The 5.4 litre engine, producing 204HP, does 0-100km in 9.6 seconds (compared with 6.8 for a conventional 750iL) and has a top speed of 226km an hour (compared with 250). It uses 40 litres per 100km compared with 13.8 for its conventional sister and the three or four litres of petrol now targeted by manufacturers.

      "bodyText": "The petrol crisis has prompted a serious rethink among some of Europe's motorists as they rush to escape the ever-present threat of higher prices by buying the latest models powered by fuel efficient, high performance, low emission diesel engines produced by manufacturers such as VW, Peugeot and even BMW. Yesterday, on the eve of the Paris motor show, analysts reported that around a third of new cars bought in Europe this year will be diesel compared with just 15% a decade ago. But the ramping up of crude oil prices and its impact on forecourts allied with regulations to reduce greenhouse gases has prompted both oil companies and car makers to bring forward the unthinkable: vehicles no longer fuelled by petrol or diesel but by alternative energy sources such as hydrogen - an apparently limitless and non-pollutant fuel previously thought of in connection with only nuclear or rocket technology. At an extraordinarily eerie filling station behind the cargo area at the Bavarian capital's airport, you can already fill up a top of the range BMW 7 series with the fuel of the future: liquid hydrogen. A robotic arm, triggered by a series of electronic messages from the dashboard and a smart payment card, glides out and fills the 750HL with up to 140 litres of liquid hydrogen - enough to travel 400km. The fuel is stored, at -253 C, in a tank fitted behind the rear seats that, according to Martin Geier, a BMW research executive, can withstand a full scale, rear end crash. The 5.4 litre engine, producing 204HP, does 0-100km in 9.6 seconds (compared with 6.8 for a conventional 750iL) and has a top speed of 226km an hour (compared with 250). It uses 40 litres per 100km compared with 13.8 for its conventional sister and the three or four litres of petrol now targeted by manufacturers. And in case the hydrogen runs out and the driver is not near the DM34m (\u00a310m) filling station at the airport, it has a 95-litre reserve petrol tank. The only problem is that you cannot yet buy the vehicle. There are only 15 such cars running in Germany. But Burkhard Goeschel, BMW's development director, says the engine has reached the stage where it is virtually ready to go into series production, and forecasts that at least several thousand will have been sold within the next few years. \"Series production, technically, can be started within a couple of months,\" says Mr Geier. Future rivals BMW has opted for liquid hydrogen, now extracted from natural gas by its project partner Linde, rather than the hydrogen fuel cells being developed by rival groups which have forged strategic partnerships: Ford and DaimlerChrysler with Canadian cell producer Ballard and General Motors and Toyota, for instance. \"Everyone is buying a ticket to the lottery because we all know that whoever wins will win big time,\" says Paul Everitt, chief economist at the Society of Motor manufacturers and Traders. \"Nobody really knows what the market will be nor what is the right technology - they know they just have to be in the game.\" BMW says it favours liquid hydrogen because that guarantees higher performance than fuel cells which, so far, can enable a car to run for around 230km rather than the 400km of the 750HL and because it promises nil emissions However, says Mr Everitt, the extraction of hydrogen from water or gas is now achieved at considerable environmental impact - and manufacturers are betting on several tickets, including hybrid vehicles, in advance of a market that is still in the making. \"Nobody says they're going to win, and there's a considerable degree of doubt. They all have their own strategy and if you get it right and hit it first, you'll be the first one into the market and have a very clear competitive advantage,\" he says. So the oil companies such as BP Amoco are backing the car groups' alliances but equally hedging their bets as to the outcome, torn between their awareness that in the medium term oil may no longer fuel the modern economies and short-term issues of cost and competitiveness. Fritz Vahrenholt, a German Shell executive involved in the BMW project, says: \"The first hydrogen filling stations are here now. In 20 years every other new car worldwide should be capable of running on hydrogen. That's our objective.\" Crude rethink The recent fuel crisis underlined the degree to which modern economies depend on oil but also that to which oil is a finite resource. Opec countries already realise that the time for achieving maximum revenues may be relatively short-lived, and Saudi Arabian ministers have said that the emergence of alternative fuels such as hydrogen should stabilise oil prices. BMW's Mr Geier points to an immediate snag: the absence of a national infrastructure to support alternative fuels. \"We could start production when we know our politicians are willing to support this and we have had no clear statements, even from the red-green coalition in Berlin, that hydrogen will be the fuel of the future.\" The more fundamental snag remains the issue at the heart of the stand-off between farmers and hauliers and their governments: tax. BMW executives acknowledge that without fiscal incentives the development of hydrogen-fuelled cars will be delayed or even prevented. So groups such as BMW may be ready to produce hydrogen-fuelled cars in volume but the political process has yet to encourage this. The recent crisis on the roads of Europe may yet prove to be the spur for a radical rethink which, within the next decade or so, will see us queuing up for fuel at filling stations such as the now deserted facility at Munich's airport.",

A protest group representing many of the activists who attempted to surround the conference centre, said it distanced itself from the violence, claiming that the rioters accounted for only 1% of protesters. \"This violence is something we really did not expect at all, and we are very, very disappointed because we're extremely committed to non-violent protest,\" said Friederike Habermann of Inpeg.",

But next Friday in Warsaw the work will be unveiled, preceded by another awkward event which happens today: the Danish referendum on the euro. Though many politicians await the Danish result as a fateful moment of truth, the Warsaw speech will be a more defining event in the Euro-Brit psychodrama. Good thing too. It does seem quite important that a British leader, and not a handful of Danish voters, should be plotting our path forward.</p> <p>The Danish vote certainly matters. Either way, there will be consequences. If the Danes vote no, however narrowly, they establish a new class of EU member: in Europe but rejecting the euro. A divide is formalised, which will please those British eurosceptics who want to go the same way. The euro will take another beating in the market. The British press will get hysterically excited by the influence on this sovereign state which the voters of Denmark must now be allowed to have.</p> <p>But the frenzy exists already. The media can't do much more damage than they're doing. On the other hand, if the Danes vote yes, the effect here will be a little deeper. It will depress the sceps, who have grown very sure that the Danes are with them. The hated EU will edge forward with another member on board the central project, and the Swedes in that event more likely to join them. In Downing Street, they're hoping for yes, but not about to let Denmark speak for the British people.</p> <p>A neglected aspect of the Labour conference has been the refusal of the leadership to let populist uprisings outside deflect them from their pro-Europeanism. It remains central to their indictment against the Tories. Mr Blair and Robin Cook used clear and unapologetic language. The political importance of this was to make it virtually impossible for them - as some have feared might be on their fail-safe agenda - to meet any looming perception of electoral crisis next year by announcing that there would not, after all, be a euro referendum in the life of the next parliament. If Blair stooped to that, which I don't believe he ever will, he would have abandoned the policy which he thinks of, among other things, as offering him his most important place in history.</p> <p>The Warsaw speech is a step towards claiming a voice in the modern history of the EU before, in a sense, Blair's own place has been secured. Until Britain embraces the euro, her right to intervene in discussions about how 21st-century Europe should be shaped will always be viewed with reserve. But that is what the speech will do. Even as I write, the choice about how to pitch it is still being made, under the hand of Sir Stephen Wall, the former EU ambassador whose new presence at Blair's right hand marks the exceptionally high importance that the Europe question now has in his counsels.</p> <p>Blair intends this to be the first speech given by any prime minister since Ted Heath which is not, at bottom, a mere reaction against what the continentals are putting up. He wants to take a positive initiative, describing a political shape for Europe that is distinctively British without being defensive, still less anti-European. Yet the core of it seems certain to challenge some of the patterns put out by Joschka Fischer, the German foreign minister, and Jacques Chirac, the French president, who started the constitutional debate a few months ago.</p> <p>Among the Big Three there are the beginnings of general agreement that, in a certain sense, Europe needs to be reclaimed for the member nations. Common to Blair, Fischer and Chirac is a view that the commission needs to be downgraded. An efficient commission, the phrase used in Brighton, is different from a strong one. The Lisbon summit this summer sidelined the commission ruthlessly. To Blair, this has become a keynote of the struggle against the infamous superstate, which the others also denounce, but also against intimations of federalism - a word the Brits would like to ban from the debate but which, especially to Fischer, is somewhere near the heart of it.</p> <p>One strong runner for prominence on Blair's agenda is a second chamber of the European parliament, composed of representatives from national parliaments. The details are nowhere near worked out. But it is a better idea than anyone else has had - an earlier advocate was Vaclav Havel - for connecting the EU to national publics who feel little relationship with it. A categoric British position is that the European parliament as now constituted should not be given another iota of power. Nor, at this stage, is London interested in an immediate advance, after the Treaty of Nice is finalised in December, towards a constitutional convention, with its superstate implications.</p> <p>This is because of the heavy priority Blair accords to EU enlargement. Until some more members join, he thinks, it is pointless to go on building Europe's shape without them. With France and Germany going colder on enlargement, we can expect Blair in Warsaw to summon Europe to its wider destiny - but not with the destructive purposes that lay behind the Thatcher-Major regime's adoption of the same cause. Even outside the euro, he is taken as speaking with good faith. He wants Nice to succeed - only the British Tories seem to want it to fail - as the minimum prerequisite to the entry of Poland and the rest of the first wave.</p> <p>He cannot avoid speaking from Warsaw to a domestic audience. It is a mystery why he always delivers these Europe speeches from distant rostrums, as if still afraid to plunge directly into a national conversation. But, as he knows, he will be closely heard here. The emphasis on the flexible role of the nations, while growing out of a conviction that this is the only way that the EU can function, will address some specifically British venom. He can be relied upon to do it without evoking memories of Mrs Thatcher's Bruges speech, her 1988 declaration of war against Brussels (although that was what a half-joking civil servant thought he was hearing when the Downing Street seminar first gathered, on the day the country seemed to be grinding to a halt).</p> <p>The real test, though, will be whether Warsaw makes a confident contribution to a vital transnational discussion.

As one impeccable Blairite put it yesterday, that noise audible all the way along Brighton beach has been \"the sound of old Labour, sucking the party back in\".</p> <p>The evidence has been clear enough. Note the subliminal quoting of Nye Bevan and John Smith by both Blair and Gordon Brown, the unashamed advocacy of taxation to fund the public services. Note, too, the PM's praise for teachers and doctors with barely a mention of the once-compulsory New Labour demand that they raise their standards and change their ways. This week Labour has been more about money than reform, more old than New.</p> <p>What explains the shift? And more pressingly, does it make sense? Or might there be a downside, one that risks putting Labour on the wrong side of the new politics - at odds with the changed mood that sent such tremors of panic through Britain earlier this month and is shaking democracies the world over?</p> <p>First, the explanation for Labour's return to type - beginning with hard political calculation. Labour lags in the polls now, but for nearly 18 months there had been an even louder warning signal: the collapse of Labour's core vote in local and European elections. To win a second term, Tony Blair needs to be sure of his base: stirring that tribal loyalty is what this week has been all about.</p> <p>Not, say the Labour strategists, that they want to turn off Labour's new voters: on the contrary, soothe the apparatchiks, Daily Mail readers want the same from this government as the Mirror crowd - decent public services. If you please the latter, you'll win the former. Blair is betting his government on the hunch that when you pit a Labour party of spending against a Tory party of cuts, the voters will stick with Labour.</p> <p>With luck, all that will come right on election night. Blair was certainly wise to rehabilitate tax-and-spend in his speech: after this month's fuel rebellion he had to make that basic, in-principle case. And a week of the old-time religion has certainly done a power of good for the Labour faithful. But the shift has come with an unfortunate parallel move. In the rush to hunker down to fundamentals, the party has forgotten one of the modernisers' most valuable innovations - an idea that may be needed more now than ever.</p> <p>For one of New Labour's great advances was to advocate the marriage of old-fashioned social democratic ideas to liberal values of citizenship and empowerment. Blairism promised not only a traditional programme of state activism, but a new approach to politics - one with room for pluralism, devolution and greater local autonomy.</p> <p>This week the party has shown its comfort with the first half of that message and its uncertainty about the second. John Prescott set the tone when he said he'd like to put Labour cooperation with the Liberal Democrats \"in a boat and send it away\". Later a rebel motion advocated direct election of at least half the members of a reformed second chamber: the leadership sent one speaker after another to the podium to dismiss such hand-wringing concern for democracy as seminar room hot air. In the end the pro-democracy motion was defeated - crushed under the boot of the union block vote.</p> <p>These attitudes did not materialise overnight. Some would say Blairism was always ambivalent about extending democracy. Scottish and Welsh devolution were unavoidable inheritances from John Smith, while the determination to block Rhodri Morgan in Cardiff and Ken Livingstone in London showed just how fearful Tony Blair really is of loosening his central grip.</p> <p>Now, though, the New Labour high command seems ready to drop the pretence. Their rhetoric no longer speaks of spreading out power. Instead, they want the voters to trust them and, in return, they will spend lots of money. The democracy talk is fading, replaced by 21st-century paternalism.</p> <p>Such a strategy represents a gamble, a wager on the belief that all Britons want are better public services. But that may contain a fatal misreading of the new mood. Something more than a demand for more money underpins the revolt of fuel protesters and pensioners alike. It's the same force that animated those anti-paedophile demonstrators on the Paulsgrove estate earlier this summer, and it's on show again this week in Prague. The common thread is a belief that the system no longer responds to people's needs.</p> <p>Hence all the talk about Blair not \"listening\". The Labour brainboxes have been puzzling over that all week. How should they respond: by apologising and looking weak, or standing firm and looking arrogant? Some say the best a modern politician can do is constantly show personal empathy, Clinton-style.</p> <p>But there may be a better way, buried in that agenda Labour now seems to regard with such tepidity. Rather than trying to buy off each successive popular revolt with a cash increase here or a handout there, a progressive government might flourish by reducing its own power - and giving more to the people complaining. Rather than saying \"we're listening, but the final decision will always remain ours,\" Labour could promise a future where people will make more of those decisions for themselves.</p> <p>Surely this can be the only answer for the Big Brother democracy now materialising before our eyes, a society that insists on much faster response to its demands. Politicians can't keep up with the new pace; if they did, Blair would be rewriting policy every other day. But there is something he can do. Rather than keeping hold of every decision, he could hand more of them over - by extending devolution to the regions and cities, by revitalising local democracy, by imagining new forms of civic power. He wants people to trust his government. First his government may have to start trusting the people. <br> <a href=\"mailto: jonathan.freedland@theguardian.com\">jonathan.freedland@theguardian.com</a></p>",

It's the same force that animated those anti-paedophile demonstrators on the Paulsgrove estate earlier this summer, and it's on show again this week in Prague. The common thread is a belief that the system no longer responds to people's needs. Hence all the talk about Blair not \"listening\". The Labour brainboxes have been puzzling over that all week. How should they respond: by apologising and looking weak, or standing firm and looking arrogant? Some say the best a modern politician can do is constantly show personal empathy, Clinton-style. But there may be a better way, buried in that agenda Labour now seems to regard with such tepidity. Rather than trying to buy off each successive popular revolt with a cash increase here or a handout there, a progressive government might flourish by reducing its own power - and giving more to the people complaining. Rather than saying \"we're listening, but the final decision will always remain ours,\" Labour could promise a future where people will make more of those decisions for themselves. Surely this can be the only answer for the Big Brother democracy now materialising before our eyes, a society that insists on much faster response to its demands. Politicians can't keep up with the new pace; if they did, Blair would be rewriting policy every other day. But there is something he can do. Rather than keeping hold of every decision, he could hand more of them over - by extending devolution to the regions and cities, by revitalising local democracy, by imagining new forms of civic power. He wants people to trust his government. First his government may have to start trusting the people. jonathan.freedland@theguardian.com",

      "body": "<p>The range of \"classical\" instruments is much the same now as it was 200 years ago; while the instruments of Beethoven's orchestra have continued to evolve, few others have joined them on the concert platform. Tommy Reilly, who has died aged 81, was fascinated by the potential of the harmonica, and became one of the handful of musicians to secure a place in the concert mainstream for an instrument from outside the existing club.</p> <p>Igor Stravinsky commented, \"After hearing your interpretation of my Chanson Russe, I would be happy to let you play anything of mine\": many composers wanted to write for Reilly, and he enjoyed an outstanding career as a performer and composer for film, television and radio.</p> <p>Born in Guelph, Ontario, Tommy Reilly was the son of Captain James Reilly, to whom, as with military bandmasters down the years, \"crossover\" came as second nature - he conducted symphony orchestras, and founded not only one of Canada's earliest jazz bands, but also the Elmdale Harmonica Band, a prizewinner at the Canadian National Exhibition in Toronto in the early 1930s. The military musical environment is exceptional in that wind players often learn string instruments too: Tommy Reilly started learning the violin at the age of eight.</p> <p>In 1935, the family moved to England, where Reilly made his professional debut as a harmonica player a year later. While keeping up his violin studies, he toured the variety theatres of the continent. At the outbreak of the second world war in 1939, he was a student at the Leipzig Conservatoire. The Gestapo arrested him, and he spent the whole period of the war in prison camps in Germany, Poland and France.</p> <p>The discipline of classical string-playing and the time made available by enforced leisure gave Reilly both the framework and the space to unlock the full expressive range of the harmonica. As Richard Morrison wrote in the Times after the first performance of Paul Patterson's Harmonica Concerto in 1987, \"Reilly's determination to establish the 'highbrow' credentials of his solid silver instrument has been matched by his skill at coaxing lyrical, musicianly sounds from this most intractable of sources.\"</p> <p>In 1945, Reilly returned to Britain, where regular radio broadcasts in the late 1940s made him a household name, and work followed right across the musical spectrum. The first of 30 major concert works written for him was the concerto by Michael Spivakovsky, broadcast as part of the Festival of Britain in 1951. Others followed from composers such as Gordon Jacob, Vilem Tausky, George Martin, Robert Farnon and James Moody. Martin produced Reilly's first recordings, 78rpm discs on the Parlophone label, in 1951, and Farnon also wrote for Reilly in his film scores, as did Bernard Herrmann, Elmer Bernstein, Maurice Jarre, Jerry Goldsmith, Dimitri Tiomkin and Ron Goodwin (Those Magnificent Men In Their Flying Machines).</p> <p>Reilly's own contribution to music for film came with the 1959 movie version of The Navy Lark, and he also supplied the jaunty interludes to the long-running radio series. His many television credits included Dixon Of Dock Green, The Last Of The Summer Wine and The Singing Detective.</p> <p>Later recordings covered arrangements of virtually anything tuneful, from British folksongs and popular classics - works by Mendelssohn, Faur\u00e9, Walton, Grainger, Smetana and Borodin - to the main theme from John Barry's score for Midnight Cowboy (1969). He also consolidated his achievement as a concert artist with recordings of Vaughan Williams's Romance for harmonica, strings and piano, and the harmonica concertos by Heitor Villa-Lobos and Malcolm Arnold.</p> <p>In 1967, Reilly had the first silver concert harmonica made to his specification, and he wrote many tutors and studies for the instrument. An OBE for services to music in 1992 was followed by awards from fellow musicians - those of the Deutscher Harmonika-Verband and the British Association of Composers, Authors and Songwriters. Reilly's worldwide reputation as a teacher and the new artistic stature he had brought to his instrument were both recognised when he was asked to conduct a harmonica masterclass at the internationally renowned Dartington summer school in 1998.</p> <p>Tommy Reilly leaves his wife Eva, son David and two grandchildren.</p> <p><b> Larry Adler writes: </b><br> Tommy Reilly was a player for whom I had deep respect. He had a style of his own, immediately recognisable. I always wanted to play the Bach Double Violin Concerto with Tommy, but the opportunity never arose. There are many good mouth organists, most of them imitating either Tommy or me, but Tommy never needed to imitate anyone. He was unique, in a class by himself. I will miss his wonderful playing: he didn't even have a close second.</p> <p>Thomas (Tommy) Rundle Reilly, harmonica player, born August 21 1919; died September 25 2000</p>",

Others followed from composers such as Gordon Jacob, Vilem Tausky, George Martin, Robert Farnon and James Moody. Martin produced Reilly's first recordings, 78rpm discs on the Parlophone label, in 1951, and Farnon also wrote for Reilly in his film scores, as did Bernard Herrmann, Elmer Bernstein, Maurice Jarre, Jerry Goldsmith, Dimitri Tiomkin and Ron Goodwin (Those Magnificent Men In Their Flying Machines). Reilly's own contribution to music for film came with the 1959 movie version of The Navy Lark, and he also supplied the jaunty interludes to the long-running radio series. His many television credits included Dixon Of Dock Green, The Last Of The Summer Wine and The Singing Detective. Later recordings covered arrangements of virtually anything tuneful, from British folksongs and popular classics - works by Mendelssohn, Faur\u00e9, Walton, Grainger, Smetana and Borodin - to the main theme from John Barry's score for Midnight Cowboy (1969). He also consolidated his achievement as a concert artist with recordings of Vaughan Williams's Romance for harmonica, strings and piano, and the harmonica concertos by Heitor Villa-Lobos and Malcolm Arnold. In 1967, Reilly had the first silver concert harmonica made to his specification, and he wrote many tutors and studies for the instrument. An OBE for services to music in 1992 was followed by awards from fellow musicians - those of the Deutscher Harmonika-Verband and the British Association of Composers, Authors and Songwriters. Reilly's worldwide reputation as a teacher and the new artistic stature he had brought to his instrument were both recognised when he was asked to conduct a harmonica masterclass at the internationally renowned Dartington summer school in 1998. Tommy Reilly leaves his wife Eva, son David and two grandchildren. Larry Adler writes: Tommy Reilly was a player for whom I had deep respect. He had a style of his own, immediately recognisable. I always wanted to play the Bach Double Violin Concerto with Tommy, but the opportunity never arose. There are many good mouth organists, most of them imitating either Tommy or me, but Tommy never needed to imitate anyone. He was unique, in a class by himself. I will miss his wonderful playing: he didn't even have a close second. Thomas (Tommy) Rundle Reilly, harmonica player, born August 21 1919; died September 25 2000",

Ms Skroza, 27, is one of the stars of Radio Index, a young and irreverent student station that has somehow survived Slobodan Milosevic's censorship police and caught the heartbeat of Belgrade. Dozens of callers, filled with rage, hurt and humour have gone on air in the last two days to call on Mr Milosevic to stand down after he polled well behind his rival in the elections. Among these callers is an elderly woman who says: \"I have to admit I voted for Slobodan Milosevic - but now that he has lost he has to respect the will of the people.\" Radio Index having become the voice of the election, Ms Skroza is talking to almost a million people in the capital. Her show starts - as always - with a recording of the tired hoarse voice of the president telling a party rally to beware the oppostion of \"rats, hyenas and foxes that want our nation to crawl like poodles to the west\". Today, her show is about the Yugoslav president's attempt to survive by staging a second round in the presidential election that the opposition contends he has already lost. \"We expected the worst possible elections,\" she says. \"Instead of that, hope was born and Serbia was laughing.

      "bodyText": "The government last night agreed to an immediate and wide-ranging review of its controversial voucher scheme for asylum seekers and the scrapping of the \"no-change\" rule on voucher use to head off a conference defeat today. Transport and General Workers' Union leader Bill Morris, who has made the campaign against vouchers a personal crusade, is now expected to support a Labour national executive statement and avoid pressing the union's motion opposing vouchers to a vote. The union has been given an understanding that the review will lead to the end of the voucher system, the TGWU said. Under the scheme, introduced in April to cut the numbers coming to Britain, asylum seekers are given vouchers to buy groceries and other essentials from selected stores, but are not allowed change if the cost of the goods is less than the value of a voucher. Tony Blair has been personally involved in negotiations all week in Brighton aimed at securing a compromise formula and avoiding a head-to-head confrontation on asylum policy with the country's most prominent black public figure. Mr Morris plans to tell delegates today his union is determined to end a \"degrading and inhuman system which creates new targets for racist attacks\" and the \"grotesque situation where taxpayers and asylum seekers are subsidising Sainsbury's and Tesco\" because of the \"no change\" rule. The TGWU yesterday released a dossier the union has used to lobby ministers for an end to the voucher scheme, including evidence of its link to racist harassment. Sodexho, the private company running the scheme on behalf of the government, has advertised vouchers to retailers as a \"revenue-making opportunity\", while both Safeway and Sainsbury's have expressed embarrassment at \"profiting from asylum-seekers\". Although ministers conceded a review of the voucher scheme at Labour's national policy forum in July, the TGWU said yesterday the new committment to an immediate review according to agreed criteria was a breakthrough. Both sides accept that if the TGWU's motion opposing vouchers is put to the conference, it will win a strong majority among union and constituency delegates alike.",

Vojislav Seselj, leader of the extremist Radical Party, is considering the move that would mean the fall of the Milosevic government. Scenting blood, Mr Seselj's nationalist extremists, whose men provided some of shock troops for Mr Milosevic's \"ethnic cleansing\" campaigns in Bosnia and Kosovo, are abandoning him. Another former ally, Vuk Draskovic, is also paying the price for refusing the join the united front against Milosevic. After a devastating defeat for his party, the Serbian Renewal Movement - he went public two days ago and said that he was wrong not to back opposition leader Vojislav Kostunica's bid to become president. Mr Milosevic's government is still in denial. The media he controls does not know how to react. On the front page of Politika, the only picture at this momentous crossroads in Serbia's history was one of the designer, Karl Lagerfeld, who is involved in a tax scandal in France. The front page, is still insisting that Mr Milosevic's party, the Socialist Party of Serbia, and his wife's party, Yugoslav Left, are going to form the next federal government. But two government television stations, BK television and Studio B yesterday surprised viewers with extensive reports from the opposition press conference, where it was announced that Mr Milosevic had lost the election. For the first time, it appears that Mr Milosevic is even beginning to lose control of one of his most powerful weapons.",

      "bodyText": "Air France and its insurers said yesterday they had launched legal action against Continental Airlines over the American carrier's possible responsibility for the Concorde crash in July that killed 113 people. French accident investigators have said a strip of metal found on the runway at Roissy-Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris resembles a piece missing from a Continental DC-10 aircraft that used the runway minutes before the doomed Concorde took off on July 25. The twisted piece of metal, apparently a wear strip from an engine thrust reverser assembly, is thought to have punctured one of the Concorde's tyres, sending chunks of rubber hurtling up into its under-wing fuel tanks. These then leaked fuel into the port engine, sparking the catastrophic blaze that sent the jetliner plunging some two minutes later into a hotel in the small town of Gonesse, killing all 109 people on board and four on the ground. \"A piece from a Continental Airlines plane could have caused the Concorde accident,\" an Air France spokeswoman said, adding that airlines were legally responsible for any damage caused if parts dropped off their aircraft. Continental Airlines said in a statement that it was aware legal action was being prepared against it, but insisted that \"at this stage of the investigation, there is no conclusive evidence that Continental Airlines is involved in the crash\". Air France's action is likely to be long and costly. It will have to prove that the strip came from Continental's flight COA 55 and that it was instrumental in causing the accident. The French accident investigators have been cautious about confirming the details of the complex chain of causes and effects that led to the catastrophe. The accident investigation bureau, BEA, has taken care to hedge its findings and stressed that its full report on the causes of the crash - which will not apportion blame but merely attempt to explain the accident - will take more than a year to prepare. The US airline may also argue that postponement of a routine runway inspection scheduled for an hour before the Air France Concorde took off could be partly responsible. The BEA's interim report last month revealed that the inspection was delayed to allow time for a 35-minute fire drill, meaning that the runway used by the doomed plane had not been checked for potentially dangerous debris for more than 12 hours. The lawsuit was lodged by Air France and its insurer, R\u00e9union A\u00e9rienne. The insurance consortium is believed to be claiming all the costs in curred in the disaster, a bill which could run into hundreds of millions of pounds. The French company has already said it will compensate the families of those killed in the accident, mainly German tourists, as well as the owner of the destroyed hotel.

Neil Holloway, Microsoft's UK managing director, claimed it was in BT's interest to delay rivals from launching super-fast ADSL net services. \"It does seem ironic that one minute the government is saying the local loop is going to be opened up in June or July next year and ... the next we hear there's not enough room [in BT's exchanges], it's the wrong type of carpet, the air conditioning was wrong on a Wednesday afternoon,\" he said. \"It's not in BT's interest to get everyone else to roll it out.

Another player in the high speed web market, RSL Communications, pulled out of the first stage of bidding and accused the industry's regulator of failing to ensure fair play for rivals to BT. The company was also under fire yesterday after it was revealed that that nearly 40% of the British population - around 23m people - will be excluded from the high speed internet revolution. Leaked BT documents suggested that the company predicts there will be \"dead zones\" where the new services will be \"commercially and technically unviable\". Those most likely to miss out were said to be businesses and consumers in Cornwall, Wales, the North East and North West, Scotland and Northern Ireland. But a spokeswoman for BT dismissed the claims and emphasised there was nothing secret or underhand about the roll-out programme. The company, she said, had always maintained the initial roll-out would only cover around 75% of the population as there were technical and geographical barriers. \"We have always said that beyond next spring it will depend on what demand there is for these new services,\" she said. \"If there was huge provider demand we could invest more in our local network to take it further out. \"If there is demand, we're not going to sit there and not go for it.\" The spokeswoman also refuted claims that BT was dragging its feet with the roll-out. \"We are working to a timetable laid down by the entire telecoms industry in the UK,\" she said. \"That is designed to open up BT's exchange to allow even more competition for broadband internet.\" Mr Holloway also noted that a link-up between Telewest and NTL - in which Microsoft own stakes of 23.7% and 3% respectively - would \"speed up competition between cable, ADSL, satellite and wireless\". Neither NTL nor Telewest were prepared to comment last night. However, industry sources said the pair were already working closely with each other and suggestions of a merger were being made. A deal would have to attract the support of France Telecom, which owns 23% of NTL and UPC NV, the Dutch cable operator, which has a 25% stakeholding in Telewest. This week's debate over broadband services will be another blow for Tony Blair's plan to get Britain online. It follows in the wake of the farce earlier this year over unmetered internet access after payment of a flat fee. AltaVista, the American internet portal and software producer, was encouraged to take a leading role but had to withdraw its service as it proved to economically unviable. Last week America Online stoked up the war between internet service providers by offering unlimited use of the web and free customer support for \u00a315 a month.",

The presidency is settled not by a national tally of Bush voters against Gore voters - the \"popular vote\" - but in a state-by-state contest in which the winner in each state collects all of that state's votes in the electoral college.

This leaves 14 swing states, in which the election is likely to be decided, with 143 electoral college votes in all. The majority of the most important states in this group are, as so often in the past, in the midwest, led by Ohio (21 votes), Michigan (18), Missouri (11) and Wisconsin (11). But the battleground is not confined to the midwest: States such as Washington (11 votes) and - the most intriguing of all - Florida (25) also remain very much up for grabs. Expect these states to get the lion's share of the campaign time and money between now and November 7.

      "bodyText": "Nelson Mandela is to appear in a \u00a3200m advertising campaign for the United Nations' Children's Fund to be directed by Steven Spielberg. The pair will collaborate on the project, which aims to push children's rights to the top of the agenda ahead of a UN report next year. The campaign will be run by the London-based advertising agency, TBWA, which won the account over M&amp;C Saatchi New York. A spokeswoman for Unicef in New York said that a deal was expected to be finalised next week. The campaign is intended to develop a coherent brand for Unicef, including an international campaign targeting corporations, governments and young people. It will aim to change attitudes among industry and government leaders. The organisation hopes to galvanise support from academic bodies, charities and industry for the project, which is known internally as the Global Movement for Children. At the time of TBWA's appointment in March, Corinne Wood, head of communications at Unicef, said: \"TBWA has demonstrated an acute understanding of the brief as well as an ability to challenge perspectives on children's issues and proven experience of repositioning global brands.\"",

What was less reassuring was how much of a \"constant struggle\" she found such a balance, and how she suspected it probably always would be.</p> <p>\"Struggle\" may be a true description of the high profile Blair household, but it has been a central plank of the campaign for better maternity and paternity rights for more than two decades that there is no reason why it should be the case for millions of other families. Indeed, campaigners argue that it is perfectly possible to remove the element of \"constant struggle\" from family life - it is simply a matter of sensible policies. There is no reason why participation in the labour market should be at the cost of children or marriages.</p> <p>There is now clear evidence that the government has broadly accepted their case on the need for reform of maternity and paternity rights. Stephen Byers, trade and industry secretary, who is leading the ministerial review on the issue, admits that maternity rights provision is inadequate, lagging up to 20 years behind provision in many European states. The battle is no longer over whether there should be reform, but what form it should take.</p> <p>It is at the birth of a child that these \"livability\" issues, as they are known in political jargon, are most sharply defined and the battle is greatest. This is one of the most physically and emotionally demanding times of women's lives, yet they are entitled to only six weeks leave at 90% of their salary, followed by statutory maternity pay of \u00a360.20 a week for 12 weeks.</p> <p>Harriet Harman, Labour's most vocal champion of improved maternity rights, argues that SMP is too low for many of the poorest paid women. In a report, commissioned by the Knitwear, Footwear and Textiles Union, the former social security secretary said she found women factory workers returning to work six weeks after the birth, often having to give up breastfeeding as a consequence.</p> <p>\"Their stories are heart-rending,\" said Ms Harman, who is lobbying for one year's paid maternity leave to be a Labour manifesto pledge for the next election.</p> <p>Christine Gowdridge, of the Maternity Alliance, pinpointed the most significant shift which policy-makers had to recognise. Women's participation in the labour market was no longer for a bit of extra pin money but was a crucial contribution to the family income. In the past 10 years this change has accelerated: in 1990 50% of women went back to work; seven years later it had leapt to 68%.</p> <p>The significance for the policy-makers is twofold. First, unless income is properly protected, the leave is not taken. Britain is, theoretically, generous on maternity leave - most women can take up to 29 weeks - but unless there are savings or a partner's income that can support the family, few women take the full entitlement.</p> <p>\"People just can't afford to take time off if it is unpaid, said Richard Dunstan, of the National Association of Citizen's Advice Bureaux. Unpaid leave was a perk for the rich, said Ms Gowdridge. So the priority for reform is more leave at full pay, said the Maternity Alliance.</p> <p>This argument is also used against unpaid parental leave. The experience across Europe has been that take-up rates, particularly among men, are poor unless it is paid properly. This year Ruth Kelly, Labour MP for Bolton West, produced a pamphlet calling for a flat-rated parental leave rate of \u00a3150 a week, which Mr Byers went out of his way to praise.</p> <p>Second, the dramatic shift in women's work patterns has been crucial in persuading the chancellor, Gordon Brown, and the Treasury that reform on maternity provision is needed. What concerned the Treasury was that women at the lowest end of the pay scale had the most inadequate rights - higher earners benefit from contractual company schemes - yet they are crucial to the government's commitment to end child poverty.</p> <p>Mary-Ann Stephenson, of the Fawcett Society, said: \"Enhanced maternity rights encourage women to stay in paid work, and in the long run that saves the Treasury money because women dropping out of the labour market are more likely to go on to benefits. They are also not building up a pension. Plus, if women take a break, when they go back to work they take a job at a lower level and lower pay. Women workers end up being deskilled, and that is a loss of productivity for the economy.\"</p> <p>These arguments are likely to carry weight with Mr Byers's review because its remit gives priority to how maternity provision affects economic competitiveness and productivity. What concerns child welfare campaigners is that the review does not include anyone with a child welfare brief, either from the Department of Health or the Home Office. They claim it makes nonsense of joined-up government.</p> <p>Campaigners fear that the government will miss the opportunity for radical reform because it is frightened by the business lobby, which has declared its vehement opposition. The government insists it will not allow business a veto, but there are worrying signs that the review will come up with only some cheap symbolism. Two weeks of paid parental leave is one such option which campaigners say will do little to improve the lot of mothers.</p>",

He owed \u00a31,800, most of which it looked like he had spent on earrings and doughnuts. </p> <p>In short, none of them deserved to win anything. Their debt was well-earned. In fact, they should be fined more money for their distinct lack of general knowledge. Out of the lot of them, the only one you could remotely feel sorry for was one Adriana, and only because she had once met Robin Cook.

Yesterday, Philip Wood stepped off a plane at Heathrow, bought himself a coffee and disappeared unchecked into a new life in Britain. Wood, 44, one of four brothers who together were dubbed \"the Canadian Krays\", was deported from Canada after being given parole. He had served 14 years of a life sentence for murdering a young woman. He was convicted along with two of his brothers.

Wearing dark glasses and a baseball cap and carrying just a holdall and a small backpack, he said, in a heavy Canadian accent, that he would need to take time to adjust to freedom. Wood was escorted to Britain by two Canadian immigration officials and met by two British officers. It is unclear where he will go, though his brother Douglas - deported to the UK in 1985, manacled to the flight deck of a military aircraft because he was deemed to be so violent - is believed to live in the Swindon area.

The Canadian government has been criticised for what is the latest in a number of cases where immigration authorities have deported criminals whose parents had failed to take out citizenship for them. Glasgow Labour MP Michael Martin has accused Canadian authorities of using Scotland \"as a dustbin for social misfits\". The Wood family emigrated to Canada from Ayrshire in Scotland in 1965 when the four sons, David, Philip, Colin and Douglas, were aged between six and eight. From their teenage years until three of them were jailed for murder they had racked up more than 100 offences for drug trafficking, assault and robbery.

But that kind of answer crumbles when you see the film. </p> <p>Anti-Slavery, one of the oldest pressure groups in the world, estimates that there are over 20 million slaves in the world today. Those statistics are very rough, of course, because slavery is illegal everywhere, and no one is volunteering their ownership figures. But we are talking about slaves . Not your average woefully underpaid, intimidated, overworked Filipino or Guatemalan teenager in a sweatshop. These are people held against their will, coerced to work with the threat of violence, and paid nothing at all. </p> <p>Brian Woods and Kate Blewett are a talkative pair who have made a string of high profile documentaries (The Dying Rooms, Innocents Lost) mainly concerning the abuse and exploitation of children. Their new programme explores three uses of slavery today: Indian children kidnapped and forced to work on carpet looms; Malian migrant workers on cocoa plantations in Cte d'Ivoire, and domestic servants in Washington and London. Woods says they chose these groups because \"We wanted a way of bringing it home to people in the West and not letting it be something people could watch and go 'isn't it terrible what people in far off lands do to other people in far off lands'.\" </p> <p>The story that holds the film together is that of Huro, a missing boy from a small village in Bihar. Blewett and Woods accompanied his father on the search to try to find him working the carpet looms. It is a heart-tugging story, without any doubt. Which makes this a kind of journalism that not everyone is comfortable with, with emotional story lines and the open participation of pressure groups. But Blewett is explicit about what they are trying to do. \"This is a campaigning film, not a current affairs programme\", she says. \"If we can spread the awareness, that can be the beginning of changes.\" </p> <p>Woods elaborates, \"The public get angry about individual stories that are representative of the whole. If you tell the broad story in a current affairs style, people can go 'yes, that's a great shame' and get on with the next programme. The only way to get a strong emotional response from people is to give them the human story and to give them an individual they can care about. Obviously, just that is not sufficient. You also need to give people the facts, and let them know what they can do.\" </p> <p>And as Blewett explains, this also means abandoning some of the conventions of investigative journalism. \"We don't want to get the government responses in, or the big companies. We don't want to go to a chocolate company and say 'we found slavery on the plantations where there's a huge chance that your cocoa is emerging from'. We know what they are going to say. We don't want to waste a portion of our film giving people the right to reply, so it's much better if we keep all the named people out and leave it as a subject like 'chocolate' or 'the carpet industry' and leave the people who watch it to bring it round to the people involved.\" </p> <p>Likewise, Woods makes no apologies about the well-crafted narrative structure of a film whose highlights include a police raid, and a trip to a cocoa plantation in Cte d'Ivoire that Blewett describes as the scariest incident in her life. \"What we are trying to do is to set the viewers to respond emotionally. The most successful way to do that is really to use the dramatic techniques of feature films, where a story is unfolding, and you're pulling people in, and you're making it difficult to switch off.\" And it does work, partly because it exposes a level of degradation that even the most globally aware members of the audience will be shocked by. </p> <p>And what brings it home are the products involved: those Indian rugs everyone comes back with, touted as something that suggests they understand the Third World. And cocoa, basis for the chocolate that this country seems to run on. The film's strongest point, the one that sticks in your mind, is the deeply scarred Malian asked about his thoughts about people who eat chocolate. \"They enjoyed something I suffered to make; I worked hard for them, but saw no benefit. They are eating my flesh.\" But the film isn't just meant to make you feel guilty, implicated. It's meant to make you want to do something. And you can do something, as the one (comparatively) positive story shows. Brazilian charcoal workers used to be slaves, until international pressure brought a change. Today, they don't earn much, and they are overworked in unhealthy conditions. But at least they've got their freedom, and they've got a chance. </p> <p>Slavery, tonight, 9pm, Channel 4.

Woods says they chose these groups because \"We wanted a way of bringing it home to people in the West and not letting it be something people could watch and go 'isn't it terrible what people in far off lands do to other people in far off lands'.\" The story that holds the film together is that of Huro, a missing boy from a small village in Bihar. Blewett and Woods accompanied his father on the search to try to find him working the carpet looms. It is a heart-tugging story, without any doubt. Which makes this a kind of journalism that not everyone is comfortable with, with emotional story lines and the open participation of pressure groups. But Blewett is explicit about what they are trying to do. \"This is a campaigning film, not a current affairs programme\", she says. \"If we can spread the awareness, that can be the beginning of changes.\" Woods elaborates, \"The public get angry about individual stories that are representative of the whole. If you tell the broad story in a current affairs style, people can go 'yes, that's a great shame' and get on with the next programme. The only way to get a strong emotional response from people is to give them the human story and to give them an individual they can care about. Obviously, just that is not sufficient. You also need to give people the facts, and let them know what they can do.\" And as Blewett explains, this also means abandoning some of the conventions of investigative journalism. \"We don't want to get the government responses in, or the big companies. We don't want to go to a chocolate company and say 'we found slavery on the plantations where there's a huge chance that your cocoa is emerging from'. We know what they are going to say. We don't want to waste a portion of our film giving people the right to reply, so it's much better if we keep all the named people out and leave it as a subject like 'chocolate' or 'the carpet industry' and leave the people who watch it to bring it round to the people involved.\" Likewise, Woods makes no apologies about the well-crafted narrative structure of a film whose highlights include a police raid, and a trip to a cocoa plantation in Cte d'Ivoire that Blewett describes as the scariest incident in her life. \"What we are trying to do is to set the viewers to respond emotionally. The most successful way to do that is really to use the dramatic techniques of feature films, where a story is unfolding, and you're pulling people in, and you're making it difficult to switch off.\" And it does work, partly because it exposes a level of degradation that even the most globally aware members of the audience will be shocked by. And what brings it home are the products involved: those Indian rugs everyone comes back with, touted as something that suggests they understand the Third World. And cocoa, basis for the chocolate that this country seems to run on. The film's strongest point, the one that sticks in your mind, is the deeply scarred Malian asked about his thoughts about people who eat chocolate. \"They enjoyed something I suffered to make; I worked hard for them, but saw no benefit. They are eating my flesh.\" But the film isn't just meant to make you feel guilty, implicated. It's meant to make you want to do something. And you can do something, as the one (comparatively) positive story shows. Brazilian charcoal workers used to be slaves, until international pressure brought a change. Today, they don't earn much, and they are overworked in unhealthy conditions. But at least they've got their freedom, and they've got a chance. Slavery, tonight, 9pm, Channel 4.

The ships steamed north to the island of Paros to help in the rescue attempt. Invincible was joined by its escort, the destroyer HMS Liverpool, and its supply ship, Fort George. The frigate HMS Cumberland, which was on its way to the Gulf, also joined the search. A Navy spokesman said Liverpool was the first British ship to arrive on the scene. Invincible, which was 35 miles to the south, launched three helicopters to join the mission. \"People were spotted clinging to rocks in the swelling seas and Invincible's helicopters winched them to safety,\" he said. But the Navy was last night pulling out of the rescue operation after British sailors described the chances of finding more people alive as extremely remote. Commander Henry Parker, a weapons engineering officer on HMS Invincible, said the sailors who picked up 12 survivors overnight - including two British women - were proud of their efforts. \"We have picked up 12 survivors, fed and watered them and treated them for shock and the cold.

Following a pilot earlier in the year, the BBC have commissioned four, half-hour sketch shows to be delivered and broadcast in March.

When we were working on the pilot we wrote well over an hour's material, recorded 45 minutes' worth and then chose our favourite 28 minutes for the final version.

      "body": "<p>Although your average 13-year-old may have no obvious similarity to her counterpart of a century ago, they have more in common than you'd think. The Victorians treated children like little adults as soon as they were old enough to be sent up a chimney and the same is true today, as a Saturday visit to any high street attests. Instead of being allowed to wallow in the miseries of puberty, which their mothers took as their birthright, little girls are educated to think - and spend - like grown-ups, years before they have anything to put in a Wonderbra.</p> <p>As the age of puberty drops to barely 12, fashion-consciousness and fascination with celebrities have mushroomed to the point at which 12 is the new 16. Meanwhile, actual 16-year-olds, with their supposed effortless street cred, are lusted after by everyone from fashion designers to food manufacturers. Thanks to icons such as professional shopper Posh Spice and a culture of consumerism, today's 12-to-16-year-old girls are rich and brand-aware enough to comprise a consumer group in their own right. There's even a snappy name for these mini-adults in designer breeches: tweenagers.</p> <p>Three women's glossies are in the process of launching tweenage versions, titled ElleGirl, CosmoGirl and Teen Vogue. In marketing terms, it's a stroke of genius: women's magazines have suffered declining circulation for years, but here's a way to instil brand loyalty right from the cradle. Tweens are already familiar with the parent titles, so if they are given their own versions containing \"the same brand values\", as ElleGirl publisher Marie O'Riordan puts it, they should be hooked on the \"brand\" for life.</p> <p>So publishers hope. National Magazines is spending \u00a34m on CosmoGirl and predicts a circulation of 500,000, which is more than grown-up Cosmo. This seems optimistic but the company is encouraged by the success of CosmoGirl's American launch a year ago and the fact that 92% of teenage girls read a magazine every month, versus only 66% of over-25s.</p> <p>O'Riordan and CosmoGirl editor Claire Baylis are vague about what will be on their pages when they appear next spring (apparently, ElleGirl will feature celebrities and fashion, while Baylis says only: \"We will be completely responsible and are drawing up guidelines about covering sex and relationships\"). But they are both banking on what O'Riordan calls \"young girls' hyper-awareness of brands\". In other words, the time has gone when teenagers shopped for no-brand clothes in fluorescent-lit emporia such as Top Shop.</p> <p>They are influenced by Gwyneth and Jennifers Aniston and Lopez, and recognise logos. And this is the bit that interests magazines most: they have an annual disposable income of \u00a38.4b, due to such factors as being doubly indulged by divorced parents, so they can afford to buy.</p> <p>Baylis describes her reader as \"wealthy, intelligent, passionate, have-it-all. CosmoGirl will do for her what Cosmo did for older women 29 years ago.\" Notice that \"have-it-all\". As CosmoGirl's mother has discovered, having it all - the career/relationship/ baby trinity - isn't conducive to maintaining sanity. But CosmoGirl is in the happy state of tweenage oblivion in which \"all\" means a boyfriend, mobile and DKNY T-shirt.</p> <p>While Cosmopolitan no longer peddles the myth that total fulfilment is possible, CosmoGirl assumes that \"all\" is within every reader's grasp. Hence confident coverlines such as Get Your Crush to Worship You and Sexy Celeb Hairstyles You Can Copy Right Now. What hormonal tweenie could resist the promise that even she can be a va-va-voom goddess if she buys CosmoGirl?</p> <p>Compare this with traditional mags such as J-17 and Sugar, which portray adolescence as the cauldron of spots and anxiety it really is. You have only to read the advice pages (\"My periods have just started and I keep getting blood on my knickers. Should I Tipp-Ex it out?\") to remember it with awful clarity. Which will kids read: the one that tells it like it is or the one that makes them feel better, older, sexier?</p> <p>That makes tween mags tempting to high-end advertisers, including Clinique, Tommy Hilfiger and Polo, who see this as an opportunity to recruit customers at an impressionable age. \"We've enormously had our eye on the teen market because they are tomorrow's consumer,\" says Clinique's Emma Dawson. \"They're so brand-aware. The average age of our customer is 33, but we want to be the first premium brand a young person buys into.\"</p> <p>The time does seem to be right for a new direction in teen titles. The last wave, spearheaded by Sugar and Bliss, was effectively neutered by the 1996 Periodical (Protection of Children) Bill, tabled by Tory MP Peter Luff in response to Sugar's frank sexual content. Most now subscribe to the self-regulating Teenage Magazine Arbitration Panel. That should reassure parents concerned about CosmoGirl inheriting Cosmopolitan's predilection for features such as Outrageous Pictures of Fabulously Firm Real Men - Naked (in the October issue, if you're interested). But it is hard to contain reservations about magazines whose mission is training kids to shop. And will the obsession with body image at the core of every adult glossy find its way into the new titles?</p> <p>Of course, it could be that publishers are overestimating the number of brand-aware mall rats. North America's growing anti-corporate movement, whose manifesto appears in the form of Naomi Klein's new book, No Logo, is a movement of young people - the very ones who should be most susceptible to CosmoGirlisation. Is it too far-fetched to believe that the CosmoGirl diet could have the effect of turning brand-sated kids into anti-capitalists? As Klein (once an ardent shopper herself) says, teenagers are contemptuous of attempts to win them over and brands that take a trendy anti-sexist or anti-racist tone are immediately seen through. That's why Starbucks, the epitome of self-conscious cool with its skinny lattes, was a main target at 1999's anti-World Trade Organisation rally in Seattle.</p> <p>So while it may feel at the moment as if no teenage girl will appear in public without her armour of turned-up Dolce &amp; Gabbana jeans, novelty-ring mobile and a Westlife CD, the seeds of rebellion are being sown. Even as O'Riordan outlines ElleGirl's fashion policy (\"We'll have the same brand values as Elle, so the clothes won't be YSL, but they'll be Tommy Hilfiger and DKNY\"), the would-be readers may have other ideas. <b>Crystal Mahey</b></p> <p>Over halfway through Y2K and we've seen the downfall of Tony Blair and the rise of lesbian nuns. What next? CosmoGirl! Cosmo is one of a number of \"grown-up\" magazines launching a teenage version.</p> <p>Maybe I should be leaping in the air with joy at this news but I'm not. There is certainly a growing teenage market and it's no surprise that it is being addressed. But what is the real point? Do publishers simply see another opportunity to fob us off with the same dressed-up crap Sugar and J-17 give us?</p> <p>As the teenage girl market is growing, so are our expectations. We are no longer satisfied with sex and emotional stories, celebrities and fashion. We need features that relate to our lives rather than the latest must-haves. This new magazine for the more sophisticated teenager doesn't offer us anything that isn't already on the market. Although it trys hard to be radical and appealing, we can see through the spin.</p> <p>Fortunately not everyone is so wrapped up in the world of business to see this. The revolution for teenage girls today is not another teen magazine claiming to be an older read, but the world wide web. Girls' sites on the web are where we are turning for radical change. It's free to publish on the internet, so we have the opportunity to write without the fear of losing revenue from advertising. Our copy doesn't have to be dictated by current market trends.</p> <p>As girls become more media-savvy, this leads them into their specialist areas faster. The teenagers of today can no longer be classed as one big group. Like everyone else, we are drawn to different niche markets and find pleasure in different things. Of course there is a mainstream stereotype of the teenage girl, but I know what trends I want to follow, what music I want to listen to and what opinions I want to hold. We should be moving away from generic magazines rather than creating more of them. Unfortunately, mainstream publications seem to understand teenagers only in terms of commercial viability.</p> <p>Teenage girls today have their own minds. It is no longer about what magazines tell us to wear, but more about what we feel fits us as individuals. The teenage girl can no longer be stereotyped into one thing. She has become too diverse and too intelligent for big magazines to categorise her.</p> <p>Personally, being interested in different aspects of culture, I find there is not one teenage girls' magazine I'm content with. Instead I look to \"grown-up\" mags that specialise in interests such as music, film and fashion. Not only do these give me features that interest me, they also write in a style that isn't patronising. I want to be able to read something I can relate to, not to be dictated to by advertising companies.</p>",

      "body": "<p>If you want to talk seriously about the painter Bridget Riley, let's dispose of Twiggy and Mary Quant and the whole 1960s Op art craze. Thirty-five years ago, Riley was the That Girl of contemporary painting. Her first show in New York sold out before it opened. But some kinds of success are deadly, or at least they could be in the days before celebrity at any price was considered the same as ambition. </p> <p>In February 1965, Riley was in a car on her way from the airport to the Museum of Modern Art in New York, where she was one of the stars of a big multi-artist survey. As she drove up Madison Avenue, she saw - in one store window after another - dresses by a variety of makers whose designs were lifted from her paintings. \"The whole thing had spread everywhere even before I touched down at the airport,\" she recalled years later. </p> <p>She was horrified and tried to sue. Fame turned to fad. The show was a mess. Americans lumped her with artists whose paintings were one-note, eye-teasing stunts. Op enjoyed its 15 minutes as a gimmick hitched to psychedelia, Carnaby Street and groovy wallpaper before dropping into oblivion. \"It will take at least 20 years before anyone looks at my paintings seriously again,\" Riley predicted. </p> <p>It took more than 30, in the US at least. But now abstract art is accepted in art's inner circles again. The art of the 1960s is being mined, and Riley has become a touchstone to an eclectic generation that includes Damien Hirst, Diana Thater, Julian Opie and Rachel Whiteread. Even if they don't relate to her old-style modernist ideals for pure abstraction, they can't help acknowledging her intelligence, style, perseverance and moral rectitude, which manifests itself in the astringency of her art. Besides, the work looks great. </p> <p>The change has been rapid. Two years ago, a modest overview of her career in the Lake District earned rave reviews in the London papers. Then last year, a London exhibition of her 1960s and 1970s pictures at the Serpentine Gallery surprised even her, attracting 130,000 people, the most ever for a show there. Now, two galleries in New York are showing her work, from the 1960s to the 1980s. At 69, Riley is finally receiving her long-deserved second look. </p> <p>Riley has a way of seeming slightly reserved and also looking very hard at you. Hair cropped and tousled, in shirt and jeans, she keeps a workingman's appearance: straight, tough, no-nonsense. She is formidable and charming, with a gritty, jaunty voice. </p> <p>A distant descendant of Gladstone, she was born in 1931 in London to a family she describes as \"not badly off but not wealthy, either.\" She spent the war in a cottage in Cornwall with her mother, sister and aunt. Her aunt had studied art. Her mother, the daughter of an English inventor who worked for Thomas Edison, lived on Park Avenue and made and lost several fortunes, was \"very visually aware\", she says. During the war years, Riley spent hours with her mother and aunt walking the countryside in Cornwall. </p> <p>Talking about different light effects and the intricate characteristics of trees and water and plants was one way of not focusing on the anxiety of her father's absence. Riley's father, a British soldier captured by the Japanese in 1941, survived forced labour on the Siamese railway but took a while to readapt to family life. \"He had learned to live in a self-contained way, to isolate himself from what was around him,\" she says. </p> <p>In 1952, she enrolled at the Royal College of Art, where she studied for three years, getting no guidance from the old-fashioned faculty, knowing that she wanted to be a painter but not knowing what kind of painter. She had her first real look at the London art scene - small, male, conservative and insular - which appalled her. Then in 1955, just after she graduated from art school, her father was nearly killed in a car accident. Riley helped to nurse him for a year, and the combined stress of that and trying to become a painter caused a nervous breakdown. Briefly hospitalised, she fell into a job at the J Walter Thompson ad agency. She was adrift. </p> <p>Then, in 1958, she went to a Jackson Pollock show in London that, she says, \"made a very powerful impact on me because it became clear that modern art was alive and I had something to react to\". The next year, she began an intense relationship with Maurice de Sausmarez, an older painter and innovative teacher whose interest in Klee, C\u00e9zanne and Seurat stimulated her to look harder at them. But it was the breakup with de Sausmarez that caused the real advance. As it had with her absent father, art became a way of dealing with loss. She has cited Proust's remark that you find what you love only by first giving it up. </p> <p>\"I wrongly attached to this person everything that I had experienced with him, which was the history of art in the 20th century, and childishly I figured when I'd lost him, I'd lost that,\" she says. \"I decided to paint one last painting, entirely black. But even then there was a small voice which looked at the painting and said: 'This doesn't express anything. What's wrong?' It had no contrast. So I put in white. I decided on two black shapes, one with a curve, the other with a straight line, opposites, nearly touching, but not touching, the white spaces between them making almost a flash of light. That was Kiss. It seemed good. And so I told myself, 'OK, just one more painting.' I was off.\" Kiss led to the early black-and-white Op works such as Movement in Squares. </p> <p>In 1960, Riley, still working at the ad agency, was dodging a downpour on the way home one day and dashed into a doorway that happened to be the entrance to an art gallery. The director invited her in, offered to look at her paintings and soon afterward gave her her first solo show. It was a huge success. Riley's art was something English art hadn't produced before: electric, bold abstraction. Then, at the peak of her fame, came the dress fiasco in New York, and Riley retreated to London. </p> <p>In Riley's six-storey Kensington house, four storeys are studios. Riley also has houses with studios in Cornwall and Provence. And she has a studio in Bow in London's east end, a loft, with apartments she uses for storage. </p> <p>Riley has never married. She has no children. A few of her latest pictures are here: vividly coloured multi-panel paintings of large, swooping, slanting curves that can bring to mind Matisse's late cutouts. She has worked constantly over the years, evolving one style out of another, each style posing problems that the next addresses, not toward some goal but in a back-and-forth, open-ended way. </p> <p>In the mid-1960s she realised that the effects she achieved in black and white already implied colours. From simple patterned stripes in basic colours such as red and blue, she moved to more complex wavy lines in several colours, which she found overrefined, so she reverted (we're up to the early 1980s now) to stripes. This time, she used a restricted palette influenced by a trip she made to Egypt, where she was struck by how the ancient Egyptians, using just a few colours, had conveyed the effect of what she has called the \"light-mirroring desert\". </p> <p>The stripes gave way a second time to a more complicated arrangement, this time of verticals and diagonals or stripes and parallelograms. These yielded a few years ago to the recent works, still based on the underlying architecture of the stripes and diagonals but now resulting in curvaceous, shimmering but less dizzying planes of interlocking colours. </p> <p>Riley has always hated it when people say her works are hard on the eyes or create optical illusions, because it implies that they're just tricks - once seen, no longer interesting. Even so, her art can be tough to look at at first. Then the eye adjusts. Space gradually opens up. With a classic stripe painting such as Apres-Midi (1981), the stripes seem magically to unfold into depth. Black stripes anchor an illusory middle ground, breaking up the image, which a viewer reads instinctively from left to right, at irregular intervals. The best works have an intense formal density and logic. This is about as good as traditional abstract painting gets. </p> <p>Since the early 1960s, assistants have carried out her pictures based on her preparatory drawings or on the works she has pasted together with colored papers on penciled grids. This is an updated version of the way artists have run their studios for centuries, notwithstanding that her secondhand approach is now being called postmodern, something she finds equally amusing and strange. </p> <p>It isn't quite true that Riley dropped off the map after Op art. The US, nationalistically myopic, mostly stopped paying attention, but a steady clientele in Europe and Japan, and a few loyal Americans, bought everything she was willing to sell through the mid-1970s. She remained a formidable presence in British art. In 1968, she was the first woman to win the painting prize at the Venice Biennale. Still, it was becoming more difficult for her as the years went by. She was never a joiner. The so-called London School of figurative painters, men like Francis Bacon, Lucian Freud and RB Kitaj, was becoming increasingly identified internationally with contemporary British art. </p> <p>She never wanted to be known as a female artist. She was an abstract painter, that was it, and only reluctantly has she come to accept that a younger generation of women, many of whom aren't abstract painters, embrace her for being a woman who stuck to her guns. </p> <p>In the early 1990s, you could buy a classic 1960s Riley drawing at Christie's in New York for $1,500 and a 1960s painting for $20,000. Now the comparative prices are up to $30,000 and $400,000. Riley's up-and-down status has always involved some degree of misunderstanding. In the 1960s, it was that she was associated with Jean Shrimpton and Op underwear. Now, it's postfeminism, postmodernism and 1960s retro chic. </p> <p>When Tate Modern opened in the spring, it devoted a room to Riley, another clear sign of changed times. </p> <p>\"Fashion always plays a part in the art world, but when it gets the upper hand it spells a vacuum,\" she says. \"During the periods of neglect, I was free to work without interruptions or distractions. I have never wanted celebrity, but I do want recognition, fair and just, not praise. I believe the work will communicate. We'll see. I am getting older.\" </p> <p>\u00a9 2000 Michael Kimmelman.

      "body": "<p>Not many choreographers, when commissioned to create a new version of Romeo and Juliet, would rush off to re-read George Orwell's 1984. But Angelin Preljocaj, currently one of Europe's most sought-after dance- makers, has a reputation for seeing the past through deviant eyes. His repertoire includes classics from the Ballets Russes repertoire, which have been reinvented as transgressive, erotic fables, and a ballet about Casanova (created for Paris Opera), whose disturbingly clinical images of corruption included star ballerina Isabella Guerin reciting aloud from a medical textbook on VD. Its premiere at the Palais Garnier caused a satisfying scandal. </p> <p>Romeo and Juliet was actually commissioned back in 1989 by Lyons Opera Ballet, when Preljocaj was barely known outside the small world of experimental modern dance. He almost declined the project, since a work involving 30 ballet dancers and one of the world's most grandiloquent scores seemed too much of a giant to tilt at. But when he considered the essence of Shakespeare's story - lovers punished under a dictatorial regime - an Orwellian dystopia seemed to make irresistible sense of it. As he says, \"I thought of a world, like some eastern Europe state, where everyone was under surveillance, under control. I liked the contrast between this very deep and sweet love and this very hard, cold, political situation. I thought it would make the love story even more fragile.\" </p> <p>Reading the novel, he was entranced on rediscovering that its heroine was called Julia - \"it seemed a sign\" - and his own version of Juliet evolved into the daughter of a Ceaucescu-style dictator, while his Romeo was a homeless drifter. \"Finally each lover needs what the other has - Romeo has no power and no money, and Juliet has no freedom.\" </p> <p>But Preljocaj's scenario wasn't just inspired by Orwell: it also chimes profoundly with his own family history. Though he's a French national, he was born in France in 1957, only two weeks after his Albanian parents fled their country as political dissidents. \"They were on the government's red list,\" he says. \"They were in danger of being shot.\" Throughout his childhood, Preljocaj learned what it means to be split between two cultures and two loyalties. Living within a tight-knit community of Albanian exiles in Paris, he says his own home was \"a little Albania ... Like all people coming from the outside my parents didn't want to lose their identities so they lived very traditionally. At home we spoke a different language, ate differently, listened to different music.\" Yet like any kid, Preljocaj was desperate to fit in - \"I was like a child with two heads\" - so outside home he was more French than the French. </p> <p>When I spoke to him in Aix en Provence, where he and his dance company are now based, Preljocaj certainly looked like a native. He is neat and graceful in an unmistakably French style (trainers, jeans and T-shirt thrown together in a perfectly judged combination). But his eyes are of a blackness that suggest a more exotic provenance, as does the golden burnish of his skin. Today he feels that his divided upbringing served him well - creating a free zone in his personality. \"All my culture is from France,\" he says, \"but there is another part that comes from a more ethnic side, that is more instinctive, more mysterious maybe.\" </p> <p>It may have been that displaced imagination that allowed him, as a refugee kid in a tough Paris suburb, to fall in love with dance. At the age of 10, Preljocaj saw a picture of Nureyev in a book. There hadn't been any dance in his background except \"some traditional dancing at weddings\", but this photo spoke to him directly. \"He was in a jump and his head was very illuminated. The title of the photo was something like 'Nureyev, transfigured by dance', and I thought: What is dance that it can make someone look so beautiful?\" </p> <p>For the next six years, Preljocaj avidly attended ballet classes to find out, but at 16 he started to feel the pressure of being the only boy in his gang of rock'n'roll-crazed friends who studied dance. By that time, too, he was finding the academic discipline of ballet restricting. \"It was always the same steps. I felt I could interpret but I couldn't express myself.\" For a while he stopped dancing completely. Then he saw some modern dance and \"it finally clicked for me. I saw how I could be moving my body in a creative way\". </p> <p>France's impressive support for dance meant that soon after founding his own company in 1984, Preljocaj was fast-tracked through the national funding scheme and based in one of the regional choreographic centres. From there his reputation spread worldwide. One reason for his popularity is that his style is so non-partisan - Preljocaj is equally articulate in ballet and modern dance and is simply interested in having a sufficiently rich palette to say what he wants to say. He is also able to create dance that is raw, direct and honest, yet beautiful to look at. His work is simultaneously glamorous and subversive, and it keeps reinventing itself. </p> <p>Such is his appeal that Ballet Preljocaj perform a packed touring schedule, while he receives more invitations than he can manage for other companies. He is also being courted to run Berlin's soon-to-be-expanded ballet company. </p> <p>Such success could make an artist complacent, but Preljocaj has inherited his parents' dissident energy. Not only does he refuse to work in any situation that bores or offends him artistically, but he will not compromise his politics. For several years he was happily based in the city of Toulon, until the Front National party started to gain power there. \"The week before the city elections I decided that if that party won I would leave. The city is very involved in the company, so these people would be sitting on our board and discussing our policies. </p> <p>It would be impossible. Unfortunately the FN were elected, so for six months we were like in the air\" (and he doesn't just mean Ballet Preljocaj but also his wife and two small daughters). \"But Provence asked us to stay in the region, and finally Aix proposed to us to come.\" Not only has the city given Ballet Preljocaj a home, but it's in the process of constructing a purpose- built base with four studios, wardrobe, offices and a 400-seat theatre. Along with salaries for 24 dancers, it adds up to a deal unique in French modern dance and conditions that British modern dancers would kill for. </p> <p> The expanded size of his company means that Preljocaj has been able to claim large-scale works such as Romeo and Juliet for his own repertoire, a work he believes has grown more relevant in recent times. The eastern bloc may have disintegrated, but other, newer Romeo and Juliet tragedies have emerged. \"I've read all these stories - like about a Serbian guy and a Bosnian girl. Romeo and Juliet will always be modern because there will always be conflict between people.\" </p> <p>For Preljocaj, though, the personal consequences of the new Europe have been happy. In 1992 he was allowed into Albania for the first time, invited by the government to perform with his company, and bring his parents with him. Not only did he get to meet his grandparents, but the day before he left he had lunch with the new president, who asked if he'd been able to visit his father's home village, in the mountains in the north. </p> <p>When Preljocaj said his schedule didn't allow for such a journey, the president offered to fly him and his parents there in a military helicopter. Telling this anecdote, Preljocaj is cynically alert to its politics. \"Bon,\" he snorts, \"of course when we arrived, there were television cameras, newsmen everywhere. It was very good publicity for the government.\" But he is also moved by the fairy-tale symmetry of it all. \"When my mother escaped from Albania she carried me with her, inside her. Thirty-five years later I brought her and my father back again. It was something very special, very strange.\" </p> <p>Ballet Preljocaj's Romeo and Juliet is at Sadler's Wells, London EC1, from October 3. Box office: 020-7863 8000.</p>",

      "body": "<p>America Online and Japan's NTT Docomo joined forced yesterday in a partnership that seems likely to dominate the fastest growing area of the internet, the wireless web. </p> <p>The union, which brings together the world's biggest internet provider and the leader in mobile communications technology, challenges European competitors such as Vodafone and Nokia that have been slow in closing the gap between wireless and fixed internet access. </p> <p>Cementing the alliance, which was announced in Tokyo yesterday, NTT Docomo will buy a 42.3% stake in AOL Japan for \u00a510.3bn (\u00a364m). </p> <p>The two companies will market each other's products and begin joint development of new technology and software to create portals, in competition with companies such as Yahoo, that can be accessed both by personal computers and mobile phones. </p> <p>\"We hope to converge our fixed and mobile internet services and spread them on a global scale,\" said the president of NTT Docomo, Keiji Tachikawa. </p> <p>No date has been set for the start of the joint service, which faces numerous technological hurdles. </p> <p>Analysts said that if those challenges were overcome the benefits to the two firms would be enormous. </p> <p>AOL, the world's most popular web portal with 24m subscribers, is a relatively old company by internet standards which has struggled to expand beyond the US and personal computers. </p> <p>The deal with NTT Docomo, which has become Japan's top mobile phone company since its establishment eight years ago, opens up new geographical and technological markets. </p> <p>Under the agreement AOL's Instant Messenger and AOL Mail will be provided to the 12m subscribers to NTT Docomo's popular i-mode service, which offers cheap and continuous access to the internet via mobile phones. AOL has fewer than half a million customers in Japan. </p> <p>In return, NTT Docomo will raise its profile in the US market and gain access to the wide array of English-language content offered through AOL. This benefit would increase if the planned merger between AOL and Time Warner goes ahead. </p> <p>The real gains are likely to come next year, when NTT Docomo plans a new high-speed cellphone service that will transmit data 200 times faster than now. This will allow downloading of music and images via phones and palmtop devices that are now only possible by PC. </p> <p>The Japanese company is believed to be almost two years ahead of its rivals in Europe in developing this third-generation mobile phone technology, but it lacks a global presence to exploit this head start. </p> <p>It has reportedly earmarked \u00a52 trillion to buy stakes in overseas companies. </p> <p>In the past year, it has entered into alliances with Hutchison Telephone, Hong Kong's biggest mobile phone firm, KPN Mobile of the Netherlands and Hutchison 3G UK Holdings. </p> <p>Analysts said that the deal with AOL would help NTT Docomo to find telecom partners in the US and Europe, bringing the wireless web closer to consumers in Britain. </p> <p>Bob Pittman, president of America Online, said the changes would be profound. \"Developing next-generation convergence technologies will make the Internet experience even more convenient, easy to use and central to people's everyday lives,\" he said. </p> <p>The alliance also heralds the emergence of Japanese companies on the global internet stage. </p> <p>Despite its reputation as a technological innovator, Japan was left behind by the explosive growth of the internet, partly because of a national aversion to English language PC keyboards.</p>",

      "bodyText": "America Online and Japan's NTT Docomo joined forced yesterday in a partnership that seems likely to dominate the fastest growing area of the internet, the wireless web. The union, which brings together the world's biggest internet provider and the leader in mobile communications technology, challenges European competitors such as Vodafone and Nokia that have been slow in closing the gap between wireless and fixed internet access. Cementing the alliance, which was announced in Tokyo yesterday, NTT Docomo will buy a 42.3% stake in AOL Japan for \u00a510.3bn (\u00a364m). The two companies will market each other's products and begin joint development of new technology and software to create portals, in competition with companies such as Yahoo, that can be accessed both by personal computers and mobile phones. \"We hope to converge our fixed and mobile internet services and spread them on a global scale,\" said the president of NTT Docomo, Keiji Tachikawa. No date has been set for the start of the joint service, which faces numerous technological hurdles. Analysts said that if those challenges were overcome the benefits to the two firms would be enormous. AOL, the world's most popular web portal with 24m subscribers, is a relatively old company by internet standards which has struggled to expand beyond the US and personal computers. The deal with NTT Docomo, which has become Japan's top mobile phone company since its establishment eight years ago, opens up new geographical and technological markets. Under the agreement AOL's Instant Messenger and AOL Mail will be provided to the 12m subscribers to NTT Docomo's popular i-mode service, which offers cheap and continuous access to the internet via mobile phones. AOL has fewer than half a million customers in Japan. In return, NTT Docomo will raise its profile in the US market and gain access to the wide array of English-language content offered through AOL. This benefit would increase if the planned merger between AOL and Time Warner goes ahead. The real gains are likely to come next year, when NTT Docomo plans a new high-speed cellphone service that will transmit data 200 times faster than now. This will allow downloading of music and images via phones and palmtop devices that are now only possible by PC. The Japanese company is believed to be almost two years ahead of its rivals in Europe in developing this third-generation mobile phone technology, but it lacks a global presence to exploit this head start. It has reportedly earmarked \u00a52 trillion to buy stakes in overseas companies. In the past year, it has entered into alliances with Hutchison Telephone, Hong Kong's biggest mobile phone firm, KPN Mobile of the Netherlands and Hutchison 3G UK Holdings. Analysts said that the deal with AOL would help NTT Docomo to find telecom partners in the US and Europe, bringing the wireless web closer to consumers in Britain. Bob Pittman, president of America Online, said the changes would be profound. \"Developing next-generation convergence technologies will make the Internet experience even more convenient, easy to use and central to people's everyday lives,\" he said. The alliance also heralds the emergence of Japanese companies on the global internet stage. Despite its reputation as a technological innovator, Japan was left behind by the explosive growth of the internet, partly because of a national aversion to English language PC keyboards.",

      "body": "<p>Sir Arthur C Clarke is exhausted. \"I've just done a video for Australian TV,\" he wheezes from his wheelchair. \"My executive secretary is away organising UN conferences. I can't speak to you for very long.\" He is dressed in a green sarong and a Hawaiian yachting shirt. He is not wearing any shoes. And he is about to go for his afternoon nap. </p> <p>The reason the world's most famous futurologist has, at 82, grudgingly agreed to do yet another interview (\"I'm fed up with them,\" he grumbles) is to promote the publication of his latest book, The Light of Other Days. It quickly emerges, though, that Clarke is already bored with this project. \"I've done three novels since then,\" he sighs, swivelling to check his inbox. Which is a shame, because this novel is not just good - but fun, capacious, and in parts brilliant. </p> <p>His home in central Colombo, Sri Lanka, is surrounded by a high wall and an electric fence. Sitting in the office, among three computers and a giant short-wave radio, Clarke explains that the \"ideas\" in the novel are all his. Most of it was actually written, though, by someone else - in this case Stephen Baxter, the 42-year-old doyen of modern British science fiction writing, and a Clarke fan. The two authors hammered out the text via a series of emails. But it was Clarke who came up with the WormCam, a time-viewing device which abolishes privacy, speculative biography and unsolved crime. </p> <p>The book, with its vision of a relentlessly voyeuristic society, includes a memorable sex scene on a bench in 2041AD Rome. Who wrote the sex bits, I wonder? \"I had an operation for prostate cancer 10 years ago,\" Clarke says. \"I haven't the slightest interest in sex. But you have to keep up with reality.\" </p> <p>Rupert Murdoch's HarperCollins publishes the novel next week. Its principal baddie is Himal Patterson, a megalomanic media tycoon who invents WormCams (which can link any point in space to any other) merely as a means of getting to the news the instant it happens. Clarke concedes that \"there are certain elements\" of Murdoch in the scheming Himal. </p> <p>Rupert and Arthur are good friends. The author of 2001: A Space Odyssey faced his trickiest moment three years ago, when he was turned over by the Sunday Mirror. It was Murdoch who wrote him a \"very nice\" note promising him that the reporters responsible would never work in Fleet Street again. \"He is a rather shy, modest person,\" Clarke says teasingly. \"I find him very deferential.\" </p> <p>The Mirror claimed that Clarke had paid young boys for sex. It produced affidavits from the boys in question. Sri Lankan police later disproved them, he says. The story ran two weeks before Prince Charles flew to Sri Lanka to confer a knighthood on the grand old man of science fiction. The saga was the lowest point in his career. At a banquet in his honour Clarke, who has post polio syndrome, found himself hobbling away from the press, pursued by an unctuous reporter from the Daily Telegraph. The episode still upsets him. \"I take an extremely dim view of people mucking about with boys,\" Clarke says. \"The whole thing was distressing to me. It was vindictive and very unpleasant. I can only assume it was a plot to embarrass Prince Charles.\" The novelist finally got his gong this May, at a low-key ceremony at the British high commission in Colombo. </p> <p>Clarke's private life remains a mystery. He was married briefly to an American, Marilyn Mayfield, now dead, whom he met while diving in Florida in the 50s. Asked whether he is gay, Clarke always gives the same puckish pro forma answer: \"No, merely cheerful.\" The answer, presumably, lies in the \"Clarkives\" - a vast collection of his manuscripts and private writings, to be published 50 years after his death. </p> <p>Like most brilliant obsessives Clarke was not, one suspects, an easy person to live with. His office is now a shrine to himself. There are photos of celebrities you would expect (astonaut Buzz Aldrin, Star Trek actorPatrick Stewart) and some you would not (Elizabeth Taylor). On the walls are photos of the moon and the Apollo landings. A vast bookshelf is devoted to his own works. Since growing up on a farm in Minehead in Somerset, Clarke has become exceedingly famous. He has written more than 80 novels, which have sold 50m copies. Back in 1945, aged 28, he wrote an essay for Wireless World in which he invented the concept of communications satellites. His celebrity reached a dizzy peak in the 50s and 60s, as the space age he had so confidently anticipated became a reality. </p> <p>And then there is 2001: A Space Odyssey, a Clarke story filmed in 1968 by Stanley Kubrick which transformed him into a household name. Did he think it would turn out like this? \"I never dreamed I would be reasonably successful. Writing was always an enjoyable hobby. If it made some money, good.\" His accent is still distinctly west country. Before trundling off for his afternoon sleep, he recounts how the greatest influences on his career were HG Wells and his half-forgotten contemporary, Olaf Stapleton. To his regret, he and Wells never met. In his early teens, Clarke - a precocious grammar school boy - would sit on a stool in his local WH Smith's reading War of the Worlds. \"I'm sure the kindly Smith's manager would have had to destroy the book afterwards because my hands were so dirty from the farm,\" he recalled. </p> <p>He devoured science fiction magazines and Arthur Conan Doyle's The Lost World (\"a classic of its kind\"). He also read Julius Caesar, Shakespeare's Sonnets, The Pickwick Papers, the Bible, the Georgian poets and AE Housman. He has still not got round to reading Hamlet. \"I have not read TS Eliot, still less Larkin,\" he adds. </p> <p>After leaving grammar school, Clarke got a job with the national audit office. By the time war arrived he was already writing technical papers - and his first science fiction short stories. When his civilian unit was evacuated to Colwyn Bay, north Wales, he was faced with the prospect of conscription; instead he joined a secret team of scientists working on radar. The days left plenty of time for writing. \"I was a devout coward. I was never in any danger. We were a long way from the action,\" he recalls. </p> <p>When the war ended he enrolled at King's College, London, taking a first in physics and maths. He summons one of his assistants to show me a 1947 photograph of his university year. The bespectacled Clarke is instantly recognisable: already balding, arms crossed, wearing a heavy suit and striped tie. Within five years he was an established writer. </p> <p>Clarke makes it clear when he has had enough of my company. He has to speak to Alastair Cooke later, he says. Most afternoons he also pops down to his club for a game of table tennis. He has lived in Sri Lanka since 1956, when he stopped off in what was then Ceylon on a diving holiday. He doesn't go out much these days and spends most of his time at the home he shares with Hector, his business partner. He is a surrogate grandfather to Hector's three daughters, Cherene, Tamara, and Melinda whom he describes as \"the apples of my eye\". </p> <p>Since the eldest two girls went away to study in Australia, Clarke admits things have been \"rather lonely\". He has seven staff - including an apolitical private secretary called Lenin - to deal with the fan mail and interview requests. He also has a pet chihuahua called Pepsi. \"I'm surprised you have not been attacked by my killer chihuahua,\" he says. It is an eccentric, affected, self-regarding, bachelor-ish existence, but then at 82 why not? </p> <p>Just before we say our farewells, Clarke reverses his wheelchair and heads back to his desk, with its three computers and giant Logitech mouse. He has to check his emails again. Most mornings, the novelist wakes to a groaningly large inbox, filled with messages from fans, friends, scientists, fellow authors, publicists and eccentrics. He is a compulsive emailer. Without Sir Arthur C Clarke, much of what the 20th century was about - the space race, moon landings, satellites, laptops, and even email itself - seems unthinkable. These days, though, in the context of a generation which has lost interest in space travel, one can't help thinking that the technology he has helped to create has in some way enslaved him. \"The last thing I wrote was a little squib of 500 words. It isn't easy to write because I spend so much time dealing with emails.\" And then he goes off to bed. </p> <p>The Light of Other Days is published by HarperCollins, price \u00a317.99.</p>",

At present 4% of all banking transactions in Europe take place over the internet, a figure that is expected to rise to 25% in 2003. The US is lagging, with the present 3% of transactions expected to rise to only 12% in three years. </p> <p>The research comes in the wake of several security blunders and scares involving online banks. Barclays was forced to shut down its online banking service for several hours in July after customers logging on were confronted with other people's account details. Three people were arrested last month following a police investigation into alleged internet banking fraud involving Prudential subsidiary Egg. </p> <p>The annual survey of financial services companies found that security - the number one e-commerce concern in 1997 and 1998 - has been dwarfed by the need to get e-commerce offerings to the marketplace fast enough to hold customers and retain market share. Competition is the greatest concern for 40% of British firms; only 4% saw security as most important.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Despite a string of internet security scares, only 4% of financial services companies cite security as their greatest e-commerce concern, with 10 times as many saying that signing up and retaining online customers is the number one issue, according to a survey today. The research from management and IT consultancy Cap Gemini Ernst &amp; Young also claimed that internet banking is \"failing consumers,\" with 59% of emails not answered within eight hours - below the 50% average for Europe. Nevertheless, Europe is leading the US in internet banking and the gap is set to become considerably wider, it says. At present 4% of all banking transactions in Europe take place over the internet, a figure that is expected to rise to 25% in 2003. The US is lagging, with the present 3% of transactions expected to rise to only 12% in three years. The research comes in the wake of several security blunders and scares involving online banks. Barclays was forced to shut down its online banking service for several hours in July after customers logging on were confronted with other people's account details. Three people were arrested last month following a police investigation into alleged internet banking fraud involving Prudential subsidiary Egg. The annual survey of financial services companies found that security - the number one e-commerce concern in 1997 and 1998 - has been dwarfed by the need to get e-commerce offerings to the marketplace fast enough to hold customers and retain market share. Competition is the greatest concern for 40% of British firms; only 4% saw security as most important.",

      "body": "<p>In the UK's cyberjungle, there is only one big lumbering beast which is really feared. It is the American predator. British e-commerce directors are constantly being warned by venture capitalists that if their defences are not strong enough they will be swallowed up by an aggressive US rival. </p> <p>Today, all the legendary internet companies are American. Freeserve might have broken new ground but everyone knows it is an online midget when compared to giants such as Yahoo!, Amazon and eBay. </p> <p>The US dominance of the internet marketplace can be explained by the fact that the Americans logged on quicker and are now streets head of everyone else in terms of technology know-how and usage. But in recent months, the image of US online supremacy has been slightly dented. There are clear signs that some American online companies are finding it difficult to crack the UK digital marketplace. </p> <p>In June, e-tailer <a href=\"http://www.fogdog.com/\" target=\"_new\">Fogdog Sports</a> closed its London office and announced it was concentrating on its US operation. At the end of August, blaming heavy losses back home, US broadcaster NBC pulled the plug on the UK launch of its internet operation. And around the same time New York-based UrbanFetch, which delivers goods within an hour, announced it was laying off 18 staff from its London office. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.urbanfetch.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">UrbanFetch</a> recently collected an award for being the most exciting newcomer from the European e-commerce association, but rumours still persist that the company is experiencing difficulties. </p> <p>\"We would be foolish to think London is going to be a walkover,\" says chief executive Andrew Tsai, who strongly denies that the business is in trouble. \"We will be fighting tooth and nail to win market share in London and it's still early days.\" </p> <p>Tsai argues that the staff cuts were necessary for the business to remain efficient. \"We're making sure we get the model to profitability by the end of next year and we are on track to do that. But it is a difficult process.\" </p> <p>E-commerce consultants point out that UrbanFetch has a tough fight on its hands. The company offers free delivery and needs to serve a dense population.

      "bodyText": "In the UK's cyberjungle, there is only one big lumbering beast which is really feared. It is the American predator. British e-commerce directors are constantly being warned by venture capitalists that if their defences are not strong enough they will be swallowed up by an aggressive US rival. Today, all the legendary internet companies are American. Freeserve might have broken new ground but everyone knows it is an online midget when compared to giants such as Yahoo!, Amazon and eBay. The US dominance of the internet marketplace can be explained by the fact that the Americans logged on quicker and are now streets head of everyone else in terms of technology know-how and usage. But in recent months, the image of US online supremacy has been slightly dented. There are clear signs that some American online companies are finding it difficult to crack the UK digital marketplace. In June, e-tailer Fogdog Sports closed its London office and announced it was concentrating on its US operation. At the end of August, blaming heavy losses back home, US broadcaster NBC pulled the plug on the UK launch of its internet operation. And around the same time New York-based UrbanFetch, which delivers goods within an hour, announced it was laying off 18 staff from its London office. UrbanFetch recently collected an award for being the most exciting newcomer from the European e-commerce association, but rumours still persist that the company is experiencing difficulties. \"We would be foolish to think London is going to be a walkover,\" says chief executive Andrew Tsai, who strongly denies that the business is in trouble. \"We will be fighting tooth and nail to win market share in London and it's still early days.\" Tsai argues that the staff cuts were necessary for the business to remain efficient. \"We're making sure we get the model to profitability by the end of next year and we are on track to do that. But it is a difficult process.\" E-commerce consultants point out that UrbanFetch has a tough fight on its hands. The company offers free delivery and needs to serve a dense population. New York is ideal because lots of people live in skyscrapers. But in London the population is more spread out and to make the economics work, large orders have to be delivered regularly to substantial numbers of people. UrbanFetch has also not been helped by some pranksters who have been going on to the site just to order one small item such as a bag of nuts which then has to be delivered free by an express courier.

      "body": "<p>President Jacques Chirac was under heavy pressure yesterday to call a truce in a potentially catastrophic feud with Lionel Jospin, his socialist prime minister, by coming clean about past covert funding operations.</p> <p>Amid growing calls for snap presidential and general elections, Patrick Devedjian, a close adviser to the president and spokesman for Mr Chirac's conservative RPR party, said the president should admit publicly that all political parties used to have illegal slush funds. This ended after the early 1990s, he maintained.</p> <p>Mr Devedjian hopes to shut the door on a cupboard positively stuffed with skeletons, and his words were echoed yesterday by those of another leading conservative, Philippe S\u00e9guin. \"We have to stop the games we're playing,\" he said.</p> <p>The president has consistently referred to all the accusations as \"utterly without foundation\", but even in his own party few now seem to believe he can maintain this approach.</p> <p>Mr Devedjian's call for openness came after several days of mudslinging prompted by the videotaped confession of an RPR official, now dead, directly implicating Mr Chirac in a vast party financing scam while he was mayor of Paris from 1977-95.</p> <p>MPs and commentators were already referring to the Chirac scandal as worthy of a banana republic when it expanded to embroil the socialists earlier this week. It emerged that their former finance minister, the disgraced Dominique Strauss-Kahn, had a copy of the video - but had not told Mr Jospin or magistrates investigating the RPR's financing.</p> <p>The RPR immediately accused the socialists of political manipulation, or even fabrication. Mr Strauss-Kahn, it was alleged, got the tape from a lawyer for granting a massive tax break to the couturier Karl Lagerfeld. The former minister, now under investigation, strenuously denies this.</p> <p>\"If the president were to close the chapter on the past it would be a healthy step for everyone, for our democracy, for a country of our standing,\" Mr Devedjian said. He said Mr Chirac should \"state publicly that everybody, including the RPR of course, raised funds illegally\", so that French politics could finally move on.</p> <p>\"We are the fourth largest power in the world and we are reduced to holding debates that are totally humiliating and degrading for all politicians and for our democracy,\" Mr Devedjian declared.</p> <p>The public Chirac-Jospin struggle comes at a time when France is in charge of complex talks on the future of the EU. After three years of polite if strained \"cohabitation\", the two leaders have every interest in abandoning a battle that would ruin them on the domestic and international stages</p> <p>Mr Jospin has already sought to calm his more virulent supporters, including the head of the socialist group in the national assembly, Jean-Marc Ayrault, who accused Mr Chirac of being a \"demagogic populist\" who was dragging French politics down and would be facing prosecution were he not covered by presidential immunity.</p> <p>\"My conception of public life has led me not to make use of scandals in political debate,\" the prime minister said on Tuesday night, before adding: \"But that does not mean we should allow ourselves to be intimidated, or to be accused collectively of crimes we have not committed.\"</p> <p>Newspaper editorials have started to call for presidential and general elections to be called much earlier than when they fall due in 2002. And an opinion poll shows that 70% of respondents want Mr Chirac to volunteer for questioning by investigators.</p> <p>\"Only a presidential election and the resignation of the government would relieve our disgust,\" said the L'Express weekly, while Ouest France said that \"everything, whether we like it or not, is happening as if we had started to plan for an early election once the French presidency of the European Union is over [at the end of December.]\"</p> <p>Allegations of underhand financial dealings at the Paris town hall when Mr Chirac was mayor are now so commonplace that most voters are readily prepared to believe the videotape.</p> <p>The investigators have also found letters that seem to corroborate the tape, adding to suspicions that the president is not telling the truth.</p> <p><b>Wages of power</b></p> <p><b>Kickbacks </b><br> Under investigation are some 60 politicians and businessmen - the Paris mayor, Jean Tiberi, among them - suspected of involvement in kickbacks from building firms seeking council contracts in the capital, run for 18 years by Jacques Chirac of the centre-right RPR</p> <p><b> Payroll scams</b><br> The former RPR prime minister, Alain Jupp\u00e9, and three former RPR treasurers are being investigation on suspicion that as many as 300 party activists were given fictitious jobs at the town hall or with friendly construction firms</p> <p><b> Influence peddling</b><br> Xavier Dugoin, a former RPR official, has been sentenced to 18 months in prison for paying \u00a320,000 to Mr Tiberi's wife Xavi\u00e8re for a 36-page report largely copied from a textbook. Mrs Tiberi's case was annulled on technicalities but will be retried in November</p> <p><b> Election fraud </b><br> The Tiberi clan under investigation is suspected of filling electoral rolls in Tiberi's Paris constituency with thousands of non-resident pro-RPR voters</p> <p><b> Elf scandal</b><br> Twenty people are under judicial investigation on suspicion of bribery and embezzlement - dating back to Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's socialist presidency in the early 90s - involving the oil company Elf. The suspects include ex-foreign minister Roland Dumas, his mistress Christine Deviers-Joncours, Elf's former president Loik Le Floch-Prigent and a number of senior executives</p>",

      "bodyText": "President Jacques Chirac was under heavy pressure yesterday to call a truce in a potentially catastrophic feud with Lionel Jospin, his socialist prime minister, by coming clean about past covert funding operations. Amid growing calls for snap presidential and general elections, Patrick Devedjian, a close adviser to the president and spokesman for Mr Chirac's conservative RPR party, said the president should admit publicly that all political parties used to have illegal slush funds. This ended after the early 1990s, he maintained. Mr Devedjian hopes to shut the door on a cupboard positively stuffed with skeletons, and his words were echoed yesterday by those of another leading conservative, Philippe S\u00e9guin. \"We have to stop the games we're playing,\" he said. The president has consistently referred to all the accusations as \"utterly without foundation\", but even in his own party few now seem to believe he can maintain this approach. Mr Devedjian's call for openness came after several days of mudslinging prompted by the videotaped confession of an RPR official, now dead, directly implicating Mr Chirac in a vast party financing scam while he was mayor of Paris from 1977-95. MPs and commentators were already referring to the Chirac scandal as worthy of a banana republic when it expanded to embroil the socialists earlier this week. It emerged that their former finance minister, the disgraced Dominique Strauss-Kahn, had a copy of the video - but had not told Mr Jospin or magistrates investigating the RPR's financing. The RPR immediately accused the socialists of political manipulation, or even fabrication. Mr Strauss-Kahn, it was alleged, got the tape from a lawyer for granting a massive tax break to the couturier Karl Lagerfeld. The former minister, now under investigation, strenuously denies this. \"If the president were to close the chapter on the past it would be a healthy step for everyone, for our democracy, for a country of our standing,\" Mr Devedjian said. He said Mr Chirac should \"state publicly that everybody, including the RPR of course, raised funds illegally\", so that French politics could finally move on. \"We are the fourth largest power in the world and we are reduced to holding debates that are totally humiliating and degrading for all politicians and for our democracy,\" Mr Devedjian declared. The public Chirac-Jospin struggle comes at a time when France is in charge of complex talks on the future of the EU. After three years of polite if strained \"cohabitation\", the two leaders have every interest in abandoning a battle that would ruin them on the domestic and international stages Mr Jospin has already sought to calm his more virulent supporters, including the head of the socialist group in the national assembly, Jean-Marc Ayrault, who accused Mr Chirac of being a \"demagogic populist\" who was dragging French politics down and would be facing prosecution were he not covered by presidential immunity. \"My conception of public life has led me not to make use of scandals in political debate,\" the prime minister said on Tuesday night, before adding: \"But that does not mean we should allow ourselves to be intimidated, or to be accused collectively of crimes we have not committed.\" Newspaper editorials have started to call for presidential and general elections to be called much earlier than when they fall due in 2002. And an opinion poll shows that 70% of respondents want Mr Chirac to volunteer for questioning by investigators. \"Only a presidential election and the resignation of the government would relieve our disgust,\" said the L'Express weekly, while Ouest France said that \"everything, whether we like it or not, is happening as if we had started to plan for an early election once the French presidency of the European Union is over [at the end of December.]\" Allegations of underhand financial dealings at the Paris town hall when Mr Chirac was mayor are now so commonplace that most voters are readily prepared to believe the videotape. The investigators have also found letters that seem to corroborate the tape, adding to suspicions that the president is not telling the truth. Wages of power Kickbacks Under investigation are some 60 politicians and businessmen - the Paris mayor, Jean Tiberi, among them - suspected of involvement in kickbacks from building firms seeking council contracts in the capital, run for 18 years by Jacques Chirac of the centre-right RPR Payroll scams The former RPR prime minister, Alain Jupp\u00e9, and three former RPR treasurers are being investigation on suspicion that as many as 300 party activists were given fictitious jobs at the town hall or with friendly construction firms Influence peddling Xavier Dugoin, a former RPR official, has been sentenced to 18 months in prison for paying \u00a320,000 to Mr Tiberi's wife Xavi\u00e8re for a 36-page report largely copied from a textbook. Mrs Tiberi's case was annulled on technicalities but will be retried in November Election fraud The Tiberi clan under investigation is suspected of filling electoral rolls in Tiberi's Paris constituency with thousands of non-resident pro-RPR voters Elf scandal Twenty people are under judicial investigation on suspicion of bribery and embezzlement - dating back to Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's socialist presidency in the early 90s - involving the oil company Elf. The suspects include ex-foreign minister Roland Dumas, his mistress Christine Deviers-Joncours, Elf's former president Loik Le Floch-Prigent and a number of senior executives",

      "bodyText": "The scientist at the centre of a missing embryo scandal may have lied about his work to cover up for mistakes, it was claimed last night. Lawyers acting for four of the victims said it looked increasingly likely that women's embryos were never frozen despite patients being told by their IVF clinic this had been done. This suggestion was backed up by sources at the privately run Hampshire Clinic, where the bulk of victims come from. \"If this is so, then there has been a huge deception on behalf of one individual, the embryologist,\" said Catherine Hopkins, a clinical negligence specialist with the Basingstoke-based Penningtons solicitors. \"Women have been told their embryos had been mislaid but now it looks as though they were never kept in the first place.\" The harvesting of the eggs is carried out by a gynaecologist, who then hands them to an embryologist for storage, a trained scientist who has sole control of them until they are reintroduced after in vitro fertilisation. The embryologist checks the eggs for IVF suitability, and if there are more eggs than is needed for immediate use, the excess eggs are frozen. The embryologist then writes to the patient telling her that the remainder have been stored for future use. \"That person could complete the paperwork as required by human fertility and embryology authority legislation but may not actually have been skilful enough to complete the embryo storage process properly,\" said Ms Hopkins. \"If, due to the lack of skill of an individual, the embryo was damaged and rendered unsuitable for reimplantation, he may have tried to cover this up. We still don't know what happened.\" Lawyers believe the latest debacle suggested that there might be other areas where standards had fallen below those set by the HFEA. The risks were heightened if, as in this case, a single embryologist worked alone and unsupervised, as was particularly common in smaller, privately run clinics. The lawyers are now calling for a full government review of existing guidelines which allow a single embryologist to have sole control over the work, including the freezing and harvesting of embryos. Penningtons said they had been acting for one victim until it emerged this week that there was a much bigger problem. Tomorrow, they are meeting lawyers from the Hampshire Clinic and are hopeful of reaching a global settlement to compensate victims. In some cases, the loss may be far greater for some women such as those who are now too old or medically unable to try another embryo cycle. Last night a hospital source confirmed that the investigation was now focusing on whether Paul Fielding, an embryologist who both worked for North Hampshire hospitals NHS trust in Basingstoke and was contracted out to the Hampshire Clinic, had tried to cover up mistakes which led to embryos being destroyed. \"It may be that he was just not very good at the freezing process and destroyed the embryos. \"In a panic he may then have tried to cover his tracks with a false paperwork trail,\" the Hampshire Clinic source said. Richard Kennedy, an obstetrician and gynaecologist and secretary of the British Fertility Society and Centre for Reproductive Medicine, said that the freezing and storage of spare embryos had been carried out under strict guidelines laid down by by the Association of Clinical Embryologists and the human fertilisation and embryology authority. IVF therapy is now routine in the UK and approximately one third of all IVF treatments generate surplus embryos suitable for freezing, stortage and future replacement in one woman. This provides the couple with an additional opportunity for a pregnancy without having to repeat the expense and risks of ovarian egg stimulation. \"There are clear recommendations in how to run an IVF lab. If embryos go missing they are either stolen, which I have not heard of in this country, or the procedures had not been followed properly. \"This case is an absolute tragedy and my heart goes out to these women who thought they had embryos in storage and may have concerns about what embryos they have had replaced.\" Tim Hedgley, of the fertility charity Issue, which been counselling victims of the blunder, said that it understood the HFEA had audited the Hampshire Clinic for the past four years, since the time it started offering IVF treatment. He said that the charity was baffled as to why HFEA inspectors had failed to detect that embryos had been missing for four years.

That Vojislav Kostunica won last Sunday's ballot is now officially confirmed.</p> <p>Even Slobodan Milosevic's lickspittle gerrymanderers gave him an eight-point lead. It seems equally certain that Mr Kostunica did indeed poll more than the 51% required for outright victory, and that this stunning result has been suppressed by systematic fraud. Without question Mr Milosevic has suffered an extraordinary reverse that he did not anticipate and is struggling to survive. And it may very well be that the end of the Milosevic era is close; for the cloud of violence now overshadowing Belgrade's streets symbolises his desperation, his utter political and moral bankruptcy. So why, when he is finally tottering on the brink, throw him a lifeline that can save him from the chasm?</p> <p>For this is what a boycott would effectively do.

      "bodyText": "The Serbian opposition's decision to boycott next month's second round of presidential elections may prove to be a mistake of historic proportions. That Vojislav Kostunica won last Sunday's ballot is now officially confirmed. Even Slobodan Milosevic's lickspittle gerrymanderers gave him an eight-point lead. It seems equally certain that Mr Kostunica did indeed poll more than the 51% required for outright victory, and that this stunning result has been suppressed by systematic fraud. Without question Mr Milosevic has suffered an extraordinary reverse that he did not anticipate and is struggling to survive. And it may very well be that the end of the Milosevic era is close; for the cloud of violence now overshadowing Belgrade's streets symbolises his desperation, his utter political and moral bankruptcy. So why, when he is finally tottering on the brink, throw him a lifeline that can save him from the chasm? For this is what a boycott would effectively do. It should be plain even to his most over-heated opponents that an uncontested second round would hand him the election on a plate. To be sure, it is doubtless true that in calling for a second round, Mr Milosevic is playing for time, is planning further subversion, and hopes to divide or buy off opponents currently exhibiting an unusual unity of purpose. Yet without an opposition challenge, Mr Milosevic will win by default and will claim, gallingly, that he has done so by the book, according to the constitution, and by democratic means.

      "bodyText": "Israel braced itself for a reshaping of its political landscape yesterday as speculation grew that the former prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, trounced at the polls and humiliated by a corruption scandal, was on the verge of a comeback. The remarkable return to public life of the most divisive figure in Israeli politics could begin immediately, after the attorney general yesterday announced his decision not to indict the former prime minister or his wife, Sara, on fraud charges. Elyakim Rubinstein said he had found insufficient evidence to try the couple on charges of stealing gifts considered to be state property, and taking bribes from a contractor. The prime minister, Ehud Barak, is not in a strong position to resist this decision, with his minority government facing the threat of new elections after the knesset reconvenes on October 30. The latest opinion polls predict a tight race between the two men, should Mr Netanyahu manage to overcome the considerable opposition within his rightwing Likud party. His victory would lumber Israel and the Palestinians with a man who did all in his power during his three years as prime minister to reverse the peace process. Yesterday, Mr Netanyahu's friends in the Likud began gearing up for his return. \"I urge Binyamin Netanyahu, if he wants to come back and end the time-out he chose for himself, to return to activity immediately,\" Reuven Rivlin, the Likud leader in the knesset, said.

His gains came as memories of Mr Gore's excellent acceptance speech began to fade and the vice-president seemed to trip over his feet every day.</p> <p>Mr Gore has a problem with telling the truth. His embellishments, exaggerations and enhancements of reality only lead to embarrassments.</p> <p>First came his claim to have \"invented\" the internet (he only backed legislation which helped make its funding possible). He said that he and his wife Tipper were the model for the movie Love Story (his college classmate wrote it but denied that it was about Mr Gore). He maintained that he discovered the massive pollution at Love Canal in New York state (he held a hearing about it but only after it was already uncovered by others).</p> <p>Last week, Mr Gore's mouth really roared. He said that he had created the strategic petroleum reserve - the oil America saves for a rainy day. He didn't. He wasn't in Congress until two years after it was established. He said that the popular labour union song Look for the Union Label was his childhood lullaby.

      "bodyText": "Last week George W Bush surged back after languishing in Al Gore's shadow ever since the Democratic national convention in mid-August. His gains came as memories of Mr Gore's excellent acceptance speech began to fade and the vice-president seemed to trip over his feet every day. Mr Gore has a problem with telling the truth. His embellishments, exaggerations and enhancements of reality only lead to embarrassments. First came his claim to have \"invented\" the internet (he only backed legislation which helped make its funding possible). He said that he and his wife Tipper were the model for the movie Love Story (his college classmate wrote it but denied that it was about Mr Gore). He maintained that he discovered the massive pollution at Love Canal in New York state (he held a hearing about it but only after it was already uncovered by others). Last week, Mr Gore's mouth really roared. He said that he had created the strategic petroleum reserve - the oil America saves for a rainy day. He didn't. He wasn't in Congress until two years after it was established. He said that the popular labour union song Look for the Union Label was his childhood lullaby. Unfortunately, it turned out he was 27 when it was composed. To cap it all off, he claimed that his mother-in-law paid more for her arthritis medicine than she had to pay for identical medicine for the family dog. But the example was hypothetical, not real, and based on a congressional study, not on personal experience. Oh well. In a campaign that has, so far, lacked issues, these examples of Mr Gore's verbal laxity have cut deeply into the vice-president's image. But now, at long last, Mr Gore may have found an issue to use to regain the lead - maintaining the Medicare programme which provides health care to the elderly. Medicare is a sacred cow in US politics. Former house speaker Newt Gingrich was doing fine in his slashing of government programmes until he proposed cutting the programme's benefits and increasing premiums. Mr Clinton seized the issue and used it to beat Mr Gingrich and get re-elected in the process. Taking his cue from his mentor in the White House, Mr Gore has proposed spending $600bn (\u00a3400bn) over the next decade to assure the solvency of the Medicare programme. But Mr Bush is so anxious for a major tax cut that he only proposes to set aside barely $150bn for Medicare. This week, Mr Gore is pounding Mr Bush over Medicare. It will pay off big time. Polls show that voters are deeply concerned about Medicare and do not expect it to survive without a healthy infusion of new revenues. More importantly, the Republican party is suspect on the issue because of its past efforts to cut the programme. Instead of allocating funds to fix Medicare, Mr Bush proposes a tax cut of $1,300bn during the next 10 years, while Mr Gore confines his generosity to a mere $500bn over the same period. Polling shows that voters would gladly accept a smaller tax cut in return for knowing that their medical needs will be met in the future. Mr Gore will begin to talk about the Medicare issue this week. As he develops traction over his differences with Mr Bush, look for him to use the issue to great effect in the first debate between the two candidates on October 3. Mr Bush, who should see Mr Gore's punch coming, has done nothing to block it. While the Republican nominee successfully defused Mr Gore's proposal to expand Medicare to cover prescription drugs for the elderly by matching it with his own initiative, he has left himself wide open on the preservation of Medicare itself. Mr Bush is more popular than Mr Gore. If there are no issues, Mr Bush will win.

Sadly, our readiness to accept the tools we are given, in the form they are given, as well as the rules they come with, reduces our role to passive consumption, and threatens to end the digital revolution before it has even begun. </p> <p>The ability to dictate what we think about is controlled, to some extent, by the people who decide on the content of our media - which headlines will be printed, which groups will win recording contracts, and which stories will appear on the evening news. The ability to dictate how we think is controlled by the people who produce the tools of media - the browsers, file-sharing programs, and networks through which all this content is disseminated and, with any luck, discussed. </p> <p>For a long time, the content and context of our media served to maintain the status quo. Interactive media - from computers to camcorders - posed a threat to both. They gave us the ability to fill newsgroups, web pages, and even cable television channels with our own stories, images, and ideas. A gossip columnist like Matt Drudge was able to force Newsweek's hand during the Clinton/Lewinsky scandal, and thousands of young programmers were free to imagine new ways for people to communicate with one another - then create them. It seemed as if no one could control anything, anymore. </p> <p>Those of us worried about censorship focused on government as the main threat to progress. We thwarted their early efforts at limiting the spread of \"objectionable\" content, and declared the internet beyond the province of any government agency. The problem with suppressing the role of government is that it gives business free reign. It's like using antibiotics to combat bacteria; when the bacteria are killed, fungus grows unabated. </p> <p>As a result, the internet became a privatised zone, and altogether more insidious forms of censorship emerged. </p> <p>The first, stoked by fear of hackers, spam, and internet porn, was the mass migration towards the internet's safe havens. Many people still believe that using America Online or another corporate- branded ISP as their access provider protects them from email viruses. These users succeed merely in shielding themselves from the kinds of content that unseen corporate censors feel is dangerous. Like people who buy the edited versions of their favourite music CDs at WalMart, they'll never know what they're missing. And all this, of course, is completely legal. </p> <p>Likewise, the slow conversion of a public telecommunications infrastructure into a privately controlled direct marketing platform turns it into a territory where the only meaningful currency is cash. Ideas spread based on their ability to generate revenue, more than interest or thought. The ultimate broadcasting tool is the business plan, and while certain media pranksters - like <a href=\"HTTP://\twww.Rtmark.com\" target=\"_new\">Rtmark.com</a> and <a href=\"HTTP://www.Etoy.com\" target=\"_new\">Etoy.com</a> - are learning to create performance art pieces that exploit this principle, the bottom line on the internet is the bottom line. </p> <p>This is why most forms of online activism concern issues of market.

Harrison is a super heavyweight and Savon is a heavyweight. \u0095 Some confusion arose over figures quoted in our report, Tougher rules for accidents at work (page 8, September 26). To be clear about it, the total number of all road users killed in accidents last year, 1999, was 3,423. \u0095 Our conversion of hectares into acres (The messiah of Troina, page 2, G2, yesterday) was wildly out. We divided when we should have multiplied. One hectare is equivalent to 2.471 acres. Therefore, 700 hectares is 1,729.7 acres (not 280) and 1,500 hectares is 3,706.5 acres (not 600). \u0095 In our Round-up, page 3, Sport, yesterday, we referred to \"France's World Cup and Euro 2000-winning captain Zinedine Zidane\". France's captain in both World Cup 98 and Euro 2000 was Didier Deschamps. \u0095 The rock and blues singer, mentioned in G2, page 12 yesterday (Has anyone here seen Leonard [Cohen]?), was Janis Joplin rather than Janice. \u0095 It is Fiona Mactaggart, MP, not MacTaggart, page 6, yesterday. \u0095 Homophone corner, from page 13, Society, September 27: \"She ... had to reign in some of the college's wilder entrepreneurial activity ...\" It is the policy of the Guardian to correct significant errors as soon as possible.

Critics of Banville insinuate that though he plays it expertly, he has only got one tune.</p> <p>Banville clearly doesn't listen to them, however, because his new novel Eclipse is, if anything, an intensifying of his characteristic mannerisms.

There, he hopes, he will be able to work out who he really is. By scrutinising his past he will be able to peel back the onion layers of identity accumulated in a lifetime of acting and discover the bare nub of his self. And that is just about all that hap pens in the book. Cleave wanders dreamily about the corridors and rooms of his house, remembering scenes and people from his past, and trying to puzzle out how he got to where he is.</p> <p>Events from reality do intrude into his reveries; a circus comes to town, a malodorous caretaker named Quirke and his feral, 15-year-old daughter, Lily, move into the house; Cleave's wife, Lydia, arrives in a flurry of bangles and cigarette smoke.</p> <p>But these real-time happenings are held at a curious distance - we only witness them through Cleave's digressive prose. Even when something terrible and momentous does finally occur, Cleave's instinctive response is to re-imagine it as a theatrical scene: \"Tragedy always has its anonymous messengers; in sandals and robe they run in fleet-footed from the wings and fall to one knee before the throne, heads bowed, leaning on the caduceus.\"</p> <p>Eclipse is Banville's boldest book to date precisely because there is so little plot to it. The Untouchable (1997) fictionalised the life of Anthony Blunt, Poussin expert and most fastidious of the four famous Cambridge spies; it contained within it the narrative drive of known history.</p> <p>Here, however, there is nothing at all to distract from the language - the novel is a carefully made display case for Banville's burnished prose. Fortunately, it stands up to scrutiny. He has a scrupulous eye for visual detail - a shaving cut dabbed at with tissue is \"a white floweret with a tiny rust-red heart\"; pond-skimmers' feet make \"pewtery dents\" on the surface of a pond - but also a fondness for splendid, elaborate images; a word or idea in a sentence can suddenly fling open the door on to an unexpected antechamber of metaphor: \"It is late, the light is going. I see what was my life adrift behind me, going smaller and smaller with distance, like a city on an ice floe caught in a current, its twinkling lights, its palaces and spires and slums, all miraculously intact, all hopelessly beyond reach.\"</p> <p>That The Untouchable, a magnificent novel, didn't even make it on to the Booker Prize shortlist was a disgrace to the prize.

For 17 years, the RSA algorithm has been the industry standard for so-called public key cryptography - a system whereby a person can encode and decode emails or other digital information by using special mathematical keys. One is a public key unique to an indi vidual that anyone can use to encode and send that person information, and one is a secret, private key, affiliated with the public key, which lets the individual alone decode it. </p> <p>Because RSA held the licence for the patented algorithm for its full US run of 17 years, many industry figures argue that RSA effectively controlled - and limited - the development of the security software industry. </p> <p>When the patent expired on September 6 (it was due to end on the 20th but RSA unexpectedly released it earlier), many senior industry figures were quick to issue biting comments. \"Over the past two decades the RSA patent and other public key patents did more to suppress the deployment of public key cryptography than the NSA (the US National Security Agency),\" said Phil Zimmer man, inventor of personal cryptography product Pretty Good Privacy, in a statement. \"As long as this patent was in effect, anyone who used it was a sharecropper on someone else's land.

It will, at best, surprise many. </p> <p>At least putting it into your machine is simplicity itself. Pop in the CD, click install and that's it. Twenty minutes later you're looking at the future of the Macintosh. </p> <p>The first thing that future does is ask you for a user name and password, in no nonsense terms. There is none of the usual happy Mac stuff; no pictures of extensions or anything like that, just a start up progress bar and then the login and password request. </p> <p>After the login, you are greeted by a group of icons bouncing up and down onto the bottom of your screen on what is known as the Dock. And that's it. </p> <p>Like most Mac users, I have a bundle of things on the desktop, as well as the trash and hard drive icons. On OS X there is nothing - no files, no bin, no computer, which makes for about 30 seconds of hyperventilating as you worry that all your files have been wiped. </p> <p>But to get anywhere with OS X you have to really Think Different, as the advert would say, or to be more honest, think like the PC crowd. To get into the desktop you have to click on the Mac face icon on the Dock at the bottom and then your machine opens up. It's a feeling very similar to using Windows because CDs and other discs appear in this window (confusingly they also appear on what Mac users normally call the desktop) alongside other files. </p> <p>The Dock is the first major alteration to the existing Mac OS that you notice. Anyone who has used the control strip will think they're getting something similar. They're not. The strip was a good idea and it could be moved, edited and so on. The dock is a tad more stubborn. </p> <p>It stays centred on the screen until it fills up and then it starts to shrink from whatever size you have made it in the preferences folder. To many it may seem like the logical extension of the control strip, but it isn't; it cannot be moved and it doesn't deal with things like sound, internet or monitor settings. </p> <p>It also takes up a centimetre of your monitor's screen real estate. That might not be a problem on 21 inch monitors, but on a 15 inch iMac it's unacceptable, and portable users will feel the same. </p> <p>The next difference is the three coloured buttons in each window: one closes the window, one puts the window in the Dock and one maximises the space given to the window. It is not earth-shattering and it does work, but Apple should consider tinkering with this so that applications do quit when the last window in an application is closed, instead of staying open and lurking somewhere. </p> <p>And somewhere is quite an appropriate word. This OS, maybe with its Unix roots showing through, needs the user to sit down and think it through. It is not what you expect from a company that prides itself on software that lets humans just get on with it without worrying about the plumbing. </p> <p>Gone is the Apple menu in the top left hand corner of the screen, and there is no Finder or clock in the top right. If you are used to using Macs this is completely disorientating.

Even the key shortcuts have been changed, reinforcing the feeling that this is not your Mac. </p> <p>But enough of the exterior, what of the system's innards? First, nearly everything you own will run thanks to the built-in OS 9 emulator. Every major application seems to work fine and the software had no problems, even running Word 5.1 from many years ago, though it was slow at cutting and pasting. </p> <p>Of my software, most major applications operated perfectly although Norton Anti-Virus refused to work, and games like Deus Ex and Unreal Tournament were very slow performers, despite being run on a 400MHz DVD iMac with 192MB of memory. </p> <p>The only other items that would not work were Apple's own DVD playing software and Virtual PC. CD playback was choppy while the machine was carrying out tasks, too. </p> <p>Connecting to the internet was problematic because of the way I had previously logged on to Demon Internet, my ISP, but access was eventually managed through the Internet Explorer beta which was enclosed.

This was wonderful. </p> <p>It is also easy to get into the Unix that runs the OS, though this may be removed by the final release. I certainly hope so - it was terrifying to watch my girlfriend use her working knowledge of Unix to take control of my iMac, changing passwords and so on without needing the Mac interface.

      "body": "<p> 'Power to the people\" may not arouse much passion as a political slogan, but 25 years ago, the idea of \"computer power to the people\" helped start a revolution. Rather than being controlled by white-coated technocrats working for governments and giant corporations, computers should be available to everyone - which implied they must also be affordable and easy to use. </p> <p>It also implied that, if there was a market for market for personal computers, some people could have lots of fun and become very rich supplying them. Thousands of companies were founded to sell the new types of hardware and software the new industry required. Most promised far more than they could deliver, which is not uncommon with revolutions. Even so, it is impossible not to be impressed by the personal computer's growth in power and performance, and its market penetration. </p> <p>Today, PCs can be found in more than 50% of American homes - a far bigger proportion than any of the pioneers seriously believed. Where California's Silicon Valley has led the way, the rest of the world has followed. </p> <p>Intel made the revolution possible by designing the first microprocessor - a \"computer on a chip\" - in 1971, but it really started in Albuquerque, New Mexico. That is where a small company called Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems, MITS, run by Ed Roberts, made backyard model rockets and pocket calculators. MITS probably did not develop the first personal computer, but it put together the first hobbyist construction kit to capture the American imagination. It also came up with a catchy name, Altair 8800, derived from an episode of Star Trek. </p> <p>The MITS Altair helped set standards that encouraged the commercial use of personal computers, and some of them are still visible today. MITS used two products: an Intel 8080 chip, the ancestor of today's Pentium, and Digital Research's CP/M operating system, which could be used today by anyone familiar with MS DOS (Microsoft Disc Operating System). </p> <p>The Altair also ran a version of Basic (Beginners all-purpose symbolic instruction code) written by a teenager called Bill Gates and his friend Paul Allen. They were inspired to write it after seeing the Altair featured on the cover of Popular Electronics magazine. They moved to the Sundowner Motel in Albuquerque to be close to their only customer, with Gates dropping out of Harvard and Allen taking a job at MITS. There, in 1975, they co-founded Microsoft. </p> <p>MITS did not last long, but the Altair inspired dozens of companies to develop similar CP/M machines, most of which could share parts. These came to dominate the small business market for personal computers, but were not really suitable for domestic use. </p> <p>However, dozens more companies targeted home users with less expandable but better integrated machines. The main ones were the Apple II, Commodore PET (Personal Electronic Transactor) and Tandy TRS-80, all launched in 1977. </p> <p>In 1978, Science of Cambridge (later Sinclair Computers) launched the MK14 microcomputer kit for \u00a339.95 plus VAT, then the ZX80, ZX81, Spectrum and QL. In 1979, another Cambridge company, Acorn, launched the System 1 microcomputer kit for \u00a365 plus VAT, followed by the Atom, the Proton, the Electron, and the Archimedes. Actually, what would have been the Proton became much better known as the BBC Micro, announced in 1982. </p> <p> The BBC's adoption of the Acorn as the basis for a government-backed computer literacy programme shows what a grip the personal computer had already gained over the popular imagination. </p> <p>Unfortunately for Acorn, and dozens of similar start-ups, the future of the computer industry had already been decided. The microcomputer business had grown too big for IBM to ignore, and on August 18, 1981, it launched the IBM Personal Computer. </p> <p>IBM was by far the biggest computer company ever (with $87.5bn in annual sales, it still is) and part of its job was to set standards. That is what it did with the IBM PC. But for whatever reasons, including earlier failures, \"time to market\" and pressure from a long-running US government anti-trust case, IBM did not take its usual line of shipping a box with an IBM processor, an IBM operating system, and IBM-everything else. Instead, it based its PC on an Intel 8088 processor and Microsoft's MS-DOS operating system. It was, it turned out, handing its 40-year monopoly of corporate data processing to a couple of upstarts. </p> <p>In 1980, IBM had a turnover of $26bn and annual profits of $3.6bn, so perhaps it felt no need to fear a tiny company like Microsoft, which had only 40 staff. And while IBM realised that Microsoft and Intel would sell their stuff to all-comers, it perhaps didn't imagine that small, unknown companies would make better, faster IBM PC-compatibles and outsell the mighty IBM. But start-ups such as Compaq and Dell were soon on the way to doing exactly that. </p> <p>By setting a standard, IBM did the industry a service. Most personal computers produced up to that point had been incompatible with one another, even if they used the same chip. The Acorn BBC B, Apple II, Commodore 64 Atari 800,and others all used the MOS Technology 6502 processor, but software houses had to write a new version of their program for each machine. Given the cost and the time required, they often didn't bother, leaving these proprietary machines struggling for applications. By contrast, any PC program would run on machines from hundreds (later, thousands) of manufacturers. This helped propel the growing market for PCs and PC clones. </p> <p>The Altair 8800 and IBM's PC and PC AT (Advanced Technology) computers also led to a fundamental change in the way the industry was organised. Until then, the fashion had been for \"vertical integration\", with each manufacturer producing as much as possible in house. This could provide a better integrated system, but also created \"lock-in\": customers had few alternatives and could not easily \"defect\" to a rival supplier. </p> <p>Many early microcomputer firms, such as Apple and Commodore, followed this proprietary line.But they could not sustain the huge research and development required, and all struggled, were taken over, or went bust. </p> <p> By constrast, the PC market of the 1980s was based on \"horizontal integration\". Whatever PC you bought, it had an x86-compatible processor supplied by Intel, AMD, IBM, NEC or whoever, a version of DOS from Microsoft, IBM or Digital Research, and the manufacturer's choice of graphics card, hard drive, keyboard, memory, and screen. Choosing the \"best of breed\" created intense competition between parts suppliers, which led to rapid innovation, increased capabilities, and (usually) lower prices. </p> <p>Microsoft was in the thick of the competition in two areas. First, there was the need to replace DOS with a more powerful multi-tasking operating system (one that could do more than one thing at once). Second, there was the long-term aim of introducing a mouse-driven graphical user interface, to make computers easier to use. This had been part of the dream since 1968, when Doug Engelbart of the Stanford Research Institute demonstrated the first mouse, and it continued in the 70s at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Centre (Parc). Xerox's work provided the inspiration for Apple's Lisa and Macintosh computers, Microsoft's Windows, and Digital Research's GEM (Graphical Environment Manager) interface, which also appeared on the Atari ST home computer. </p> <p>In the 1970s, Xerox Parc was a decade ahead of the rest of the world, with its graphical interfaces and networks of personal computers connected to laser printers, which it sometimes showed off to visitors such as Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. But while it did launch some products, such as the Xerox Star 8010 in May 1981, they were expensive and never achieved commercial success. Instead of making Xerox rich, Parc's ideas enriched the industry, as firms such as Apple and Microsoft hired away their staff. </p> <p>At first, Microsoft had seen AT&amp;T's Unix as the obvious replacement for DOS, and announced its own version, Xenix. But while powerful, Unix was notoriously hard to use, and required more power than most PC users could afford. It also came in too many incompatible \"flavours\", of which Xenix was merely one. In 1987, Microsoft and IBM combined to launch OS/2 as a DOS replacement. However, since it didn't control the market and couldn't control IBM, Microsoft also wanted to hedge its bets. It didn't abandon Windows, and it opportunistically hired a group of defectors from Digital Equipment to write another DOS/Unix replacement, which appeared as Windows NT (New Technology). </p> <p>Some saw Microsoft's actions as treachery. Others recognised that IBM was trying to wrest back its control of the industry from Microsoft, Intel, Compaq and the rest. This plan revolved around OS/2 (later transferred to IBM's sole ownership), a proprietary MCA (Micro Channel Architecture) expansion bus, and Systems Application Architecture - a schema designed to tie IBM's Personal Systems (PS/2) to large IBM minicomputer and mainframe systems. Compaq formed a \"Gang of Nine\" to support a plausible alternative future, and IBM's plan failed. </p> <p>Next, IBM formed an alliance with Apple, which adopted IBM's PowerPC chip. They were still the two biggest personal computer suppliers in the US, and thought they could take on Intel. They were wrong, and later, Apple bottled out of the plan to move to a common hardware reference platform (CHRP) agreed between IBM, Apple, and Motorola. IBM then abandoned the launch of its own Power Personal Systems. </p> <p>The balance of power had already tipped Wintel's way in 1990, when Microsoft shipped Windows 3.0. Unlike OS/2, it was cheap, and easy to adopt. Users could even buy graphical applications such as Microsoft Word for Windows and the Excel spreadsheet (both first developed for the Apple Macintosh) and Corel Draw. </p> <p>At the time, Microsoft's turnover was only $1bn a year while IBM's was $67bn, so Big Blue was not about to admit defeat. It pumped vast amounts of cash into OS/2, promoting it as \"a better Windows than Windows\", until the stunning success of Microsoft Windows 95 sealed its fate. From that point on, Microsoft was clearly the computer industry's top dog, and sales of Windows-based PCs exploded. Microsoft's turnover grew from $1bn to $23bn during the decade, despite the continuous attentions of the Federal Trade Commission and the US Justice Department. </p> <p>Their investigations culminated in a trial in which Microsoft's business practices were comprehensively damned, leading Justice Penfied Jackson to order the break-up of the company - a decision now pending appeal. </p> <p>What is interesting is that, during the 1990s, despite its monopoly power, Microsoft was no more able to replace the DOS-Windows combination than anybody else. </p> <p>The Windows NT operating system, introduced in 1993, was supposed to do it. NT was designed to run on a range of different processors (Intel, Mips, DEC Alpha, PowerPC), to use more than one processor at once, and to offer the reliability and stability of rivals such as OS/2 and Unix. Despite various inducements, such as letting companies install NT for the same price as Windows 95, sales struggled. Three times, Microsoft has announced that the latest version of DOS-Windows (Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows Me) would be the last of the line, giving users little choice about moving to NT (now called Windows 2000). So far, it has not made it stick. </p> <p>Apple Macintosh users have been equally conservative, declining to move to technically superior systems such as Steve Jobs's NeXT or Be's BeOS, launched on the dual-processor BeBox. It remains to be seen if Jobs, the Apple co-founder who retuned to the company at the end of 1977, can shift them to an updated version of NeXT's Unix-based operating system, Mac OS X (see page 12 for a review of this system). </p> <p>That's the problem with revolutions: they may be exciting, but most users prefer evolution. They don't what to risk losing what they have in some great leap into the unknown. The result may be boring, but it is a sign of the personal computer's success that what started as a revolution has become the status quo. </p> <p> Which is not to say that progress has stopped. It has, rather, moved to handheld devices such as electronic organisers and mobile phones, to sealed-box \"appliances\" such as WebTV sets and games consoles, and most importantly, to the internet. And as the growth of the personal computer market has slowed, many PC companies - including Intel and Microsoft - have invested heavily in these new areas in search of the Next Big Thing. </p> <p>For a couple of decades, Microsoft's mission statement summed up the ambition of the PC industry: to put a computer on every desk and in every home. </p> <p>That has been changed to take in every type of device used anywhere at any time. The only argument is about whether we are entering the \"Post PC\" era, as some pundits claim, or the \"PC Plus\" era of Microsoft's new .Net (dot.net) vision, where the net, rather than the PC, is the software platform. </p> <p>Whatever happens, I expect companies raised in an industry based on rapid innovation and cut-throat competition will adapt and survive. Old and slow minicomputer and mainframe companies were generally unable to live with PC-based competitors, and old and slow consumer electronics and telecoms companies may be in for a big surprise. </p> <p><strong> Twenty five years of personal computing</strong></p> <p> <strong> 1975</strong> </p> <p> MITS Altair 8800 </p> <p>Microsoft Basic </p> <p> <strong> 1977</strong> </p> <p> Apple II </p> <p>Commodore PET </p> <p>Tandy TRS-80 </p> <p> <strong> 1980</strong> </p> <p> Sinclair ZX80 </p> <p> <strong> 1981</strong> </p> <p> IBM Personal Computer </p> <p>Microsoft MS-DOS </p> <p> <strong> 1982</strong> </p> <p> Acorn BBC B </p> <p>Commodore 64 </p> <p> <strong> 1984</strong> </p> <p> Apple Macintosh </p> <p>IBM PC AT </p> <p> Atari ST </p> <p>Commodore Amiga </p> <p> <strong> 1987</strong> </p> <p> IBM PS/2 and OS/2 </p> <p> <strong> 1988</strong> </p> <p> NeXT Cube </p> <p> <strong> 1990</strong> </p> <p> Microsoft Windows 3 </p> <p> <strong> 1991</strong> </p> <p> Apple-IBM deal </p> <p> <strong> 1993</strong> </p> <p> Intel Pentium </p> <p>Microsoft Windows NT </p> <p> <strong> 1994</strong> </p> <p> Apple Power Macs </p> <p>IBM OS/2 Warp 3 </p> <p> <strong> 1995</strong> </p> <p> Microsoft Windows 95 </p> <p> <strong> 1997</strong> </p> <p> Apple buys NeXT </p> <p> <strong> 2000</strong> </p> <p> Microsoft.net announced </p> <p>Apple OS X</p>",

      "bodyText": "'Power to the people\" may not arouse much passion as a political slogan, but 25 years ago, the idea of \"computer power to the people\" helped start a revolution. Rather than being controlled by white-coated technocrats working for governments and giant corporations, computers should be available to everyone - which implied they must also be affordable and easy to use. It also implied that, if there was a market for market for personal computers, some people could have lots of fun and become very rich supplying them. Thousands of companies were founded to sell the new types of hardware and software the new industry required. Most promised far more than they could deliver, which is not uncommon with revolutions. Even so, it is impossible not to be impressed by the personal computer's growth in power and performance, and its market penetration. Today, PCs can be found in more than 50% of American homes - a far bigger proportion than any of the pioneers seriously believed. Where California's Silicon Valley has led the way, the rest of the world has followed. Intel made the revolution possible by designing the first microprocessor - a \"computer on a chip\" - in 1971, but it really started in Albuquerque, New Mexico. That is where a small company called Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems, MITS, run by Ed Roberts, made backyard model rockets and pocket calculators. MITS probably did not develop the first personal computer, but it put together the first hobbyist construction kit to capture the American imagination. It also came up with a catchy name, Altair 8800, derived from an episode of Star Trek. The MITS Altair helped set standards that encouraged the commercial use of personal computers, and some of them are still visible today. MITS used two products: an Intel 8080 chip, the ancestor of today's Pentium, and Digital Research's CP/M operating system, which could be used today by anyone familiar with MS DOS (Microsoft Disc Operating System).

Why can't Avedon? Must we all either agree with her or be denounced? </p> <p>Or perhaps Avedon has just discovered that some filtering software is rubbish and doesn't do what it promises or ought to do. This is hardly unique, and equally it is not a good enough reason for giving up on trying to improve it. </p> <p>If Avedon and her friends want to look at pornography, I have no problem with that. Equally, if I or other parents, or teachers, or office managers, want to make decisions about what is, and is not, acceptable in the home, classroom or workplace, I think we ought to respect that and not seek to imply that they are either the dupes or willing accomplices of people with political agendas, the theocrats or the police. </p> <p>The internet can be many things to many people and good filtering software simply extends our power to choose. I'll have the internet I want and Avedon can have hers. Won't that be nice for both of us? <br> <strong> John Carr</strong> <br> NCH Action For Children <a href=\"mailto:john.carr@lineone.net\">john.carr@lineone.net</a> </p> <p>I work in a school, teaching IT. Two years ago I was on the plush stand of a very major educational IT provider at a large IT education show in London discussing with one of their reps just what my school's considerable payment to his firm would secure me. One of the main selling points was unbeatable web censoring software which would ensure that nothing dodgy would ever assail the eyeballs of my pupils. </p> <p>I asked to try one of the online computers and typed\"nazi\" into the search engine as a likely KS3 history subject which a pupil might be asked to research.

      "bodyText": "Be tolerant Avedon Carol's piece on filtering software was more a polemic about attitudes towards pornography than a serious discussion of contemporary concerns about the evolution of such programs and their likely impact on the internet. I accept that there is room for more than one view on the issue of pornography. Why can't Avedon? Must we all either agree with her or be denounced? Or perhaps Avedon has just discovered that some filtering software is rubbish and doesn't do what it promises or ought to do. This is hardly unique, and equally it is not a good enough reason for giving up on trying to improve it. If Avedon and her friends want to look at pornography, I have no problem with that. Equally, if I or other parents, or teachers, or office managers, want to make decisions about what is, and is not, acceptable in the home, classroom or workplace, I think we ought to respect that and not seek to imply that they are either the dupes or willing accomplices of people with political agendas, the theocrats or the police. The internet can be many things to many people and good filtering software simply extends our power to choose. I'll have the internet I want and Avedon can have hers. Won't that be nice for both of us? John Carr NCH Action For Children john.carr@lineone.net I work in a school, teaching IT. Two years ago I was on the plush stand of a very major educational IT provider at a large IT education show in London discussing with one of their reps just what my school's considerable payment to his firm would secure me. One of the main selling points was unbeatable web censoring software which would ensure that nothing dodgy would ever assail the eyeballs of my pupils. I asked to try one of the online computers and typed\"nazi\" into the search engine as a likely KS3 history subject which a pupil might be asked to research. The first two responses at the top of the page were about Adolf Hitler. The third one was \"Gay Nazi Porn\". \"Will it let me surf to that, do you think?\" I said, and with one click it did.

Ted Slade tedslade@poetrykit.org Bash bullies It is surprising that there was not a more vigorous response from your readers to the IOC's attempts to prevent anyone for whatever reason using the word Olympic (Online, September 14). There needs to be some general way to stop this bullying of small organisations by large, well-financed ones. Clearly it was nonsense that the Sydney Olympic Cafe, so-called for 25 years, should be stripped of its name by the new-in-town IOC. An Anti-Vexatious Nonsense Ombudsman should be appointed. This officer should be empowered, on receipt of an appeal from an individual or small organisation, to order both parties to appear before him or her. Judgment should be given the same day and no appeal should be possible. Any attempt to circumvent a judgment should receive a draconian response. Or in the case of a government department, instant dismissal of the minister and six months, 48 hours per week community service. Finally, the appointment of an effective AVN ombudsman should be a condition of membership of the United Nations where of course the similar procedures should be employed against large countries bullying small ones.

Finally, next summer comes another short series against Pakistan, a triangular tournament, and what might prove the defining point of the management partnership, the Ashes. Last summer may have been good but in reality they have hardly scratched the surface. </p> <p>No single one of these series will be easy, although the limited-overs stuff is less predictable. To win a Test series in Pakistan will be desperately difficult, however, if account can be taken of history. </p> <p>Eighteen matches over six series in Pakistan have produced a single England win, in the first match in 1961. Pakistan have won two, with 15 draws. The two home wins came in the first match of the last two series and if Pakistan go one up, there is no one better at maintaining the lead. England will hope the pitches do not lean excessively towards Pakistan's spinners and that their batting holds up. A draw would be an achievement. </p> <p>If anything, the trip to Sri Lanka could be more testing still. If Pakistan might hedge their bets with their pitches in the knowledge that they can also field the pace of Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis and, if he has returned to fitness, Shoaib Akhtar, then there is no doubt at all that Sri Lanka will be playing to their strength, that is Muthiah Muralitharan, 291 wickets now at a strike rate superior either to Shane Warne or Saqlain Mushtaq, his only rivals as the world's leading spinner. Expect dust bowls, high temperatures and sapping humidity. </p> <p>England will not be able to match Sri Lanka in their ability to exploit turning pitches or to play the turning ball. Muralitharan took 16 wickets at the Oval the last time the sides met and that spectre will live on. The only comfort for England will be in the recent performance of South Africa who came back from a match down to draw the series. </p> <p>The opportunity is there now for England players to expand their reputations. Marcus Trescothick, for example, has received all sorts of plaudits these past few months and has played worthily on difficult pitches. Now is the time to take it a stage further. So too with Michael Vaughan. </p> <p>Then there is Hussain, who endured an abysmal season with the bat, offset only by his burgeoning authority as captain. He is surely too good a player not to return to form and will have worked out a way to divide his responsibilities to his team with those to himself. Certainly tinkering with the order is not a sound idea because to accommodate one person, another suffers. </p> <p>The nature of England's attack in Pakistan will provide the most soul searching. From the outside it seems crystal clear: unless the pitches are desperately slow turners from the outset, there can be no justification for trying to include spinners who are extremely ordinary at international level. Given dusty conditions and sandpaper outfields the seam can still find purchase when the ball is new and Darren Gough, Craig White and Dominic Cork are skilled exponents of reverse swing when it becomes roughed up. </p> <p>Not since the war has the side that played in the last Test of a summer reconvened for the opening match of the following winter, but England should try to build on their success with continuity.</p>",
