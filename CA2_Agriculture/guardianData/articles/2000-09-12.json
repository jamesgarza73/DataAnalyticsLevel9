White suburbanites bemoan the loss of their cities to crime, drugs and - by extension - black neighbourhoods. When they say, \"It's a jungle down there\", you're supposed to know what they mean. Black community leaders wonder out loud why the shops in their areas are owned by recently arrived Koreans. US cities are divided cleanly along ethnic axes - an enduring American apartheid. </p> <p>George W Bush put almost all the black members of the Republican party on the stage at his convention to prove his open-mindedness. Al Gore argues that there needs to be a greater national awareness of racism before any progress is possible. </p> <p>Actually, the awareness of race as an issue could not be higher. What might be needed, conversely, is to take the race issue down the agenda - and take some of the political heat out of a debate which has become distorted by party political point-scoring, white guilt and overzealous legal action. </p> <p>Nowhere is a new approach more needed than in the workplace. Racism in any form stains the working environment, and has to be stamped out. But hypersensitivity about colour or religious affiliation can be counterproductive. A friend of mine is a senior civil servant in the US government. He is an ultra-progressive, humane, open-minded white man. (Oh, and he's gay. In America, where group membership is minutely calibrated, that probably matters). He is currently under investigation for anti-semitic and racist behaviour. </p> <p>A Jewish woman has accused him of overlooking her for a position because of her faith. The process entails interviews with equal opportunities officers and rigorous questioning of his own beliefs. The fact that he was unaware she was Jewish makes no difference. And an African-American man has accused him of racism after being suspended for sexual harassment. (This is where workplace politics get really sticky.) The man in question placed his hand on a female colleague's bottom and squeezed, in full view of a dozen people, in the office canteen. (Oh, she's black, too. In America that definitely matters.) </p> <p>US managers say that it is many more times more difficult to fire, discipline or warn a non-white employee for fear of lawsuits and bad PR. This is crazy. An equal society is one in which people are treated on the basis of their abilities and effort, not colour or creed. This must work both ways - in firing as well as hiring. Otherwise, firms will be reluctant to hire people from ethnic minorities in the first place - not because they are racist, but because they are afraid of being labelled as such if the recruit is not up to the job and has to be dismissed. </p> <p>The problem is that a whole industry of lawyers, lobbyists, politicians, equal opportunities officers and human resources specialists has been built on the premise that US citizens are incapable of acting in an enlightened fashion. And few are prepared to take this lobby on, for fear of being accused of racism themselves. </p> <p>None of which is to say that racism is over and done with. Far from it. Or that there should not be the strictest sanctions for those who act in discriminatory ways. But America needs a dose of the optimism about human nature enshrined in its constitution, and echoed by leaders such as Martin Luther King. Real racism is bad enough: there's no need to see it lurking everywhere. </p> <p> Strangely, there is one form of prejudice that the US endorses enthusiastically - ageism. At a conference in New York last week, the convenor asked all the \"young people, whose enthusiasm, energy and ability to think outside the box are so needed\" to stand up. This being America, a few dozen eager youths leapt to their feet to receive a ripple of applause. At a stroke the convenor therefore insulted anybody not defined as \"young\" and patronised those who were. </p> <p>In a separate session, a speaker invited his 12-year-old son, who spent the entire time playing a handheld computer game (and it was difficult to blame him), to tell the audience about his concerns for the future. On hearing his name, the young man in question looked up, startled, and said: \"Well, if an asteroid hit us, that would be really really bad, wouldn't it?\" At times like this, an asteroid strike seems like the least we deserve. </p> <p>\u0095 Richard Reeves is director of futures at the Industrial Society.

What might be needed, conversely, is to take the race issue down the agenda - and take some of the political heat out of a debate which has become distorted by party political point-scoring, white guilt and overzealous legal action. Nowhere is a new approach more needed than in the workplace. Racism in any form stains the working environment, and has to be stamped out. But hypersensitivity about colour or religious affiliation can be counterproductive. A friend of mine is a senior civil servant in the US government. He is an ultra-progressive, humane, open-minded white man. (Oh, and he's gay. In America, where group membership is minutely calibrated, that probably matters). He is currently under investigation for anti-semitic and racist behaviour. A Jewish woman has accused him of overlooking her for a position because of her faith. The process entails interviews with equal opportunities officers and rigorous questioning of his own beliefs. The fact that he was unaware she was Jewish makes no difference. And an African-American man has accused him of racism after being suspended for sexual harassment. (This is where workplace politics get really sticky.) The man in question placed his hand on a female colleague's bottom and squeezed, in full view of a dozen people, in the office canteen. (Oh, she's black, too. In America that definitely matters.) US managers say that it is many more times more difficult to fire, discipline or warn a non-white employee for fear of lawsuits and bad PR. This is crazy. An equal society is one in which people are treated on the basis of their abilities and effort, not colour or creed. This must work both ways - in firing as well as hiring. Otherwise, firms will be reluctant to hire people from ethnic minorities in the first place - not because they are racist, but because they are afraid of being labelled as such if the recruit is not up to the job and has to be dismissed. The problem is that a whole industry of lawyers, lobbyists, politicians, equal opportunities officers and human resources specialists has been built on the premise that US citizens are incapable of acting in an enlightened fashion. And few are prepared to take this lobby on, for fear of being accused of racism themselves. None of which is to say that racism is over and done with. Far from it. Or that there should not be the strictest sanctions for those who act in discriminatory ways. But America needs a dose of the optimism about human nature enshrined in its constitution, and echoed by leaders such as Martin Luther King. Real racism is bad enough: there's no need to see it lurking everywhere. Strangely, there is one form of prejudice that the US endorses enthusiastically - ageism. At a conference in New York last week, the convenor asked all the \"young people, whose enthusiasm, energy and ability to think outside the box are so needed\" to stand up. This being America, a few dozen eager youths leapt to their feet to receive a ripple of applause. At a stroke the convenor therefore insulted anybody not defined as \"young\" and patronised those who were. In a separate session, a speaker invited his 12-year-old son, who spent the entire time playing a handheld computer game (and it was difficult to blame him), to tell the audience about his concerns for the future. On hearing his name, the young man in question looked up, startled, and said: \"Well, if an asteroid hit us, that would be really really bad, wouldn't it?\" At times like this, an asteroid strike seems like the least we deserve. \u0095 Richard Reeves is director of futures at the Industrial Society.

      "bodyText": "The days when Chelsea appointed a relative unknown are long gone. So perhaps are the days of the player-coach. Ken Bates appears to believe the time has come for a tried and tested manager to take over at Stamford Bridge. Watch out for a low-risk, high-cost, well-known mover and shaker. Gianfranco Zola The bookmakers' favourite, but could be seen as too risky by Bates. One of Vialli's problems was a lack of faith from senior players and the appointment of Zola or Dennis Wise could throw up the same obstacle. George Graham The Stamford Bridge rumour machine has him prepared to ditch White Hart Lane, where he his tenure has not been a bed of roses. Would enjoy the freedom to spend. Terry Venables Top notch credentials, but a dodgy financial history that may not endear him to the Stamford Bridge boardroom. Sven-Goran Eriksson The manager of Serie A champions Lazio has been linked to Chelsea in the past and has hinted that he would like to try his hand in England. Johann Cruyff Proven pedigree, took Barcelona to European Cup triumph in 1992. Dino Zoff Former Italy and Lazio coach would keep alive the Italian bloodline. Frank Rijkaard Former Holland coach but perhaps too close to Ruud Gullit in style and the player-manager tradition. Known to not rate Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink. Graham Rix Temporary manager after Vialli's sacking. Criminal sex life and too risky an appointment. Ray Wilkins Already a club faithful but his managerial record hardly shines. Too risky.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>PAOLO CAN YOU GO?</strong></p> <p>Yesterday, the Fiver suggested that Gianluca Vialli was like a teenager with a trust fund (not unheard of round West London way), resolving all his problems with a wave of a credit card. Today, we would like to take back that suggestion, as it is becoming increasingly apparent that Luca doesn't actually need a reason to go and splash the cash.</p> <p>According to reports, West Ham (they of bottom-of-the-table fame) are this afternoon in talks with Paolo Di Canio in an attempt to persuade the temperamental/magical/balding Italian not to sign for fashionable West London boutique Chelsea's of Chelsea. This follows a few hours of uncertainty after the Hammers announced they had rejected a \u00a34m bid from the Blues for their star striker. Vialli is said to see Di Canio - and not Eidur Gudjohnsen, Gianfranco Zola, Tore Andre Flo, or anybody else he's already got - as the perfect partner for Jimbo Hasselbaink.</p> <p>The Hammers would only profess ignorance about the current state of play when the Fiver spoke to them this afternoon. Which wasn't a denial (if you think about it). And while they are said to be desperate to hold onto Di Canio, the cheeky cockneys have been known to turn a profit on their players before, and are unlikely to get a better offer for a 32-year-old they signed for only \u00a31.7m last year. </p> <p>Vialli and Di Canio know each other from their days at Juventus, and Paolo has a framed photo of the pair on his mantelpiece if our memory of Football's Foreign Legion serves us right. What's more, the top wage at the top boutique is three times that of the luvable East End rogues. We really aren't sure what's going to happen, but we're confident that Luca doesn't have a clue either.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>FUEL FOR THOUGHT</strong></p> <p>Glug! Glug! Glug! Glug! Glug! Glug! Gl- oh, hello there. Do excuse us, there's a perfectly rational explanation as to why we're drinking thousands of gallons of petrol, and it's this: we want to annoy as many people in Middle England as possible by forcing them to catch the bus or, God forbid, walk. Mind you, our amusing little prank looks like backfiring on us because The Fuel Crisis Sweeping The Nation - to use its official Government-approved title - is starting to affect the footer.</p> <p>Only a day after Middlesbrough's Paul Ince was forced to miss training when the tank in his Guvmobile ran dry, things have taken a more serious turn. Tonight's match between Bristol City and Brentford has been called off, despite the Football League's earlier announcement that no games would be cancelled due to The Fuel Crisis Sweeping The Nation. Brentford had enough juice to get themselves down the M4 and back, but City were worried their stewards wouldn't be able to turn up and so they cancelled the fixture with safety uppermost in mind.</p> <p>One cancellation we can live with, but if this The Fuel Crisis Sweeping The Nation continues, the entire football season could grind to a halt. Maggie Thatcher, bless her, would have dealt with such blatant militancy by sending in the army, thus nipping the problem in the bud and eroding the very fabric of working-class British society at a stroke. But she's long gone, so what should we do? The Fiver can only think of one suggestion: to conserve energy, supporters could watch a team from a nearby town instead of jetting off to Lancashire for their footy fix. Actually, that's not very realistic, is it?</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"If you are a top actor you can earn \u00a310m for one movie - but I never see people saying that is too much money. I am not saying it isn't hard being an actor, but I think it is a lot harder to be a footballer\" - David Ginola, whose masterful performance in the Renault Laguna and L'Oreal ads garnered him praise from around the world.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>IT'S BIG AND BACK</strong></p> <p>And so Big Cup is back, giving the Imperial Lord Ferg the opportunity to blame injuries for any defeat and David O'Leary O'Leeds the chance to enjoy Milan and Barcelona (although probably not Istanbul) before getting another shot at Euro-Vase. Arsene Wenger and Dick Advocaat however will be rubbing their hands so hard they could start a small bonfire - because, after much European failure, both have a fantastic chance of qualifying for the second group stage.</p> <p>However, you wouldn't know it listening to Arsene's Arsenal Wenger. Earlier today, Arsenal was ruing the time he invited ageing Czech footballer called Ivan Hasek to come to Highbury to study his training methods - only for Hasek to transform into the Sparta Prague manager he faces tonight! \"I have some small regrets now about letting him observe our methods,\" said an understated Wenger like a Sixties TV baddie. \"I have known Hasek for a long time.

      "bodyText": "PAOLO CAN YOU GO? Yesterday, the Fiver suggested that Gianluca Vialli was like a teenager with a trust fund (not unheard of round West London way), resolving all his problems with a wave of a credit card. Today, we would like to take back that suggestion, as it is becoming increasingly apparent that Luca doesn't actually need a reason to go and splash the cash. According to reports, West Ham (they of bottom-of-the-table fame) are this afternoon in talks with Paolo Di Canio in an attempt to persuade the temperamental/magical/balding Italian not to sign for fashionable West London boutique Chelsea's of Chelsea. This follows a few hours of uncertainty after the Hammers announced they had rejected a \u00a34m bid from the Blues for their star striker. Vialli is said to see Di Canio - and not Eidur Gudjohnsen, Gianfranco Zola, Tore Andre Flo, or anybody else he's already got - as the perfect partner for Jimbo Hasselbaink. The Hammers would only profess ignorance about the current state of play when the Fiver spoke to them this afternoon. Which wasn't a denial (if you think about it). And while they are said to be desperate to hold onto Di Canio, the cheeky cockneys have been known to turn a profit on their players before, and are unlikely to get a better offer for a 32-year-old they signed for only \u00a31.7m last year. Vialli and Di Canio know each other from their days at Juventus, and Paolo has a framed photo of the pair on his mantelpiece if our memory of Football's Foreign Legion serves us right. What's more, the top wage at the top boutique is three times that of the luvable East End rogues. We really aren't sure what's going to happen, but we're confident that Luca doesn't have a clue either. * * * * * * * * * * * * * FUEL FOR THOUGHT Glug! Glug! Glug! Glug! Glug! Glug! Gl- oh, hello there. Do excuse us, there's a perfectly rational explanation as to why we're drinking thousands of gallons of petrol, and it's this: we want to annoy as many people in Middle England as possible by forcing them to catch the bus or, God forbid, walk. Mind you, our amusing little prank looks like backfiring on us because The Fuel Crisis Sweeping The Nation - to use its official Government-approved title - is starting to affect the footer. Only a day after Middlesbrough's Paul Ince was forced to miss training when the tank in his Guvmobile ran dry, things have taken a more serious turn. Tonight's match between Bristol City and Brentford has been called off, despite the Football League's earlier announcement that no games would be cancelled due to The Fuel Crisis Sweeping The Nation. Brentford had enough juice to get themselves down the M4 and back, but City were worried their stewards wouldn't be able to turn up and so they cancelled the fixture with safety uppermost in mind. One cancellation we can live with, but if this The Fuel Crisis Sweeping The Nation continues, the entire football season could grind to a halt. Maggie Thatcher, bless her, would have dealt with such blatant militancy by sending in the army, thus nipping the problem in the bud and eroding the very fabric of working-class British society at a stroke. But she's long gone, so what should we do? The Fiver can only think of one suggestion: to conserve energy, supporters could watch a team from a nearby town instead of jetting off to Lancashire for their footy fix. Actually, that's not very realistic, is it? * * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"If you are a top actor you can earn \u00a310m for one movie - but I never see people saying that is too much money. I am not saying it isn't hard being an actor, but I think it is a lot harder to be a footballer\" - David Ginola, whose masterful performance in the Renault Laguna and L'Oreal ads garnered him praise from around the world. * * * * * * * * * * * * * IT'S BIG AND BACK And so Big Cup is back, giving the Imperial Lord Ferg the opportunity to blame injuries for any defeat and David O'Leary O'Leeds the chance to enjoy Milan and Barcelona (although probably not Istanbul) before getting another shot at Euro-Vase. Arsene Wenger and Dick Advocaat however will be rubbing their hands so hard they could start a small bonfire - because, after much European failure, both have a fantastic chance of qualifying for the second group stage. However, you wouldn't know it listening to Arsene's Arsenal Wenger. Earlier today, Arsenal was ruing the time he invited ageing Czech footballer called Ivan Hasek to come to Highbury to study his training methods - only for Hasek to transform into the Sparta Prague manager he faces tonight! \"I have some small regrets now about letting him observe our methods,\" said an understated Wenger like a Sixties TV baddie. \"I have known Hasek for a long time. I didn't know that he would become Sparta's coach and that we would meet [in Big Cup]. He has obviously learned well, but I hope not too well,\" he added sinisterly, as some lackey prepared the words 'Kapow' and 'Biff' to be flashed on screen. The Pope's Rangers, who start their Big Cup campaign tonight against Sturm Graz, seem in more confident mood. The Austrian side are in somewhat of a pickle, having lost their last three games and, though the Fiver's no Cracker, the mood can't have been helped when their chairman told the press today that manager Ivica Osim can't stand up to his players. \"He is scared to take a risk and axe some of his players from his team,\" Hannes Kartnig whined, \"but he has to find a way out of this mess and I don't know if he can do that tonight in Glasgow.\" Maybe not, but on recent form we're sure Bert Konterman and Fernando Ricksen will do all they can to help. * * * * * * * * * * * * * THE RUMOUR MILL English clubs have been offered Nigerian international defender Taribo West for free after AC Milan cancelled his contract with the club, according to reports. Newcastle have made an official approach for \u00a31m-rated Colchester striker Lomana Lua Lua. Celtic defender Alan Stubbs is angling for a move to Everton. \"One day I would love to play for Everton\", he said. \"That's the team I grew up supporting.\" * * * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF Leeds winger Jason Wilcox will be out for eight weeks after breaking his left ankle in a training ground accident. Wilcox had only just returned to the first team on Saturday after two knee operations had kept him out of Leeds' squad for the entire summer. Gerry Taggart has signed a new three-year contract with Leicester City which will keep him at the club until the summer of 2003. Unsettled Aston Villa defender Ugo Ehiogu is to have more talks with John Gregory over his future at the club. \"The situation with [Gregory] is the same as it's always been,\" Ehiogu said. \"There isn't much contact, which I'm going to try to address today. I'm going to try to get one or two things cleared up because I think it's gone on long enough.\" Ipswich have agreed terms with NK Maribor for the transfer of Slovenian international defender Amir Karic for an undisclosed fee. Newcastle have rewarded 18-year-old striker Shola Ameobi with a four-year contract after he impressed on his Premiership debut. Ashley Westwood has completed his \u00a3150,000 move from Bradford to Sheffield Wednesday. Everton's hopes of signing Israeli international Idan Tal have been dashed after the player was refused a work permit. Hibernian have announced a massive \u00a31.9m increase in turnover over the past season, their first back in the Scottish Premier League. Mark Lillis has been sacked as manager of Halifax Town after just 15 months in the job. His former assistant Peter Butler and goalkeeping coach Tony Parks will take temporary charge of the team at Cardiff tonight. * * * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO ITV: The Big Match (10pm) Arsenal and Rangers' latest Big Cup disasters - the highlights.

Shame. </p> <p><strong>What a relief</strong><br> Media Monkey feels duty-bound to report the latest unsavoury incident involving Sun TV reporter Emily Smith, despite concern that it may be accused of developing a Dominic Mohanesque obsession. Earlier this week Wee Smithy apparently ordered a cab from home to the press launch for Channel 5's fab new voyeur TV-fest, Jailbreak. After the cab showed up outside her abode, Smith gathered her things and headed out the door, only to be met by the sight of the cabbie - a woman - squatting to relieve herself in the front garden.

How much did they raise? Get this - a whopping \u00a350,000. Of course the fans haven't just given the band the money, they've effectively bought the CD in advance. Clearly they were so blinded by Marillion's music that they've entrusted the band not to produce a pile of shite. Could Marillion have hit onto something?

You may recall the reason why First Tuesday is so called is because it holds events on the First Tuesday of every month. It's called stating the obvious because it's true, us internet types aren't that bright. Other networking groups have been a little more inventive - The Chemistry, The Ecademy and The Glasshouse for example - but none have been quite so bold as to pinch First Tuesday's inspirational idea, as First Monday, one of those it does-exactly-what-it-says-on-the-tin type of events - and absolutely nothing to do with First Tuesday. And it doesn't look like stopping there - a quick skinny though Net Names and it turns out that all variations of First and a day of the week have already been registered. Prepare to be inundated. </p> <p> <strong>Top banana</strong><br>A free banana to the correspondent from Wardour Street who's come up with the first response to Media Monkey's call for Big Brother tie-in ideas. Big Brother-branded prozac \"for when you know they're watching you\" we like; but the suggestion involving nipple cams is just not appropriate for a family-oriented diary column.</p> <p><strong>Bunch of Arse</strong><br>Always up for a good old crusade against hypocrisy, Media Monkey is indebted to the TV type who pointed out some shocking inconsistencies in Granada Media's net-busting deal to buy a piece of the famous Arse. After all, is this not the same Granada Media that was just recently arguing for the Carlton/United merger to be red-carded because it would cause a deplorable widening of the north-south media divide? Surely, following this logic, if Charlie Allen's Weatherfield Rovers mob are so committed to the north, they should be putting their wonga into say, Accrington Stanley, or Bradford Park Avenue? </p> <p><strong>What an offer, Hezza</strong><br> Michael Heseltine's generous offer to sell his book to staff at the knock-down price of \u00a310 has apparently met with a terrific response. So much so that Hezza has promised to sign every one personally. \"His generosity exceeds our wildest expectations,\" said a Haymarket source. </p> <p><strong>Jungle fever?</strong> <br> A memo went round Haymarket Publishing's offices today with the following unmissable offer for all Michael Heseltine's minions: \"Haymarket has a quantity of Michael Heseltine's book, \"Life in the Jungle\", published today, at the special price of \u00a310.\" The lines to Hezza's office must be jammed. <br></p> <p><strong>Wise words</strong> <br> Andrew Neil, speaking at the recent People and Profits in the New Economy conference: \"If you have trouble with recruitment and retention, then your company sucks.\" Could that be the same Andrew Neil who has recently had quite a lot of trouble with staff retention at the Scotsman? Your words, Andrew, not ours. <br></p> <p><strong>Mo better box</strong> <br> Word that retiring Labour MP St Mo of Mowlam is considering a TV career has got Media Monkey flicking through its contacts book in search of old broadcasting muckers who may be able to help out. The first call will undoubtedly be to the ITV Network Centre, where they are still a chief executive short of a full ITV Council. St Mo would be the ideal candidate - after all, she has plenty of experience of a job where people are always knifing you in the back. But Media Monkey would welcome other suggestions...</p> <p><strong>\"Nasty\" Nick snapped</strong> <br> Media Monkey is certain the Sun, as the official Big Brother newspaper, will be gagging to get its hands on some photos reportedly doing the rounds, which show \"Nasty\" Nick Bateman in his first public clinch with a member of the opposite sex since being evicted from the house of two-way mirrors. The offending snaps, taken outside the Met Bar after the TV Quick awards on Tuesday night (September 4), are said to feature Nick in a warm embrace with, er... go-getting Sun TV reporter Emily Smith. All in the line of duty, no doubt.</p> <p><strong>Sky's the limit</strong> <br> Does the low cunning of the BSkyB marketing department know no bounds? Imagine little Johnnie and Jemima's delight when, after a spot of bulletin reading courtesy of Sky News during their visit to the Millennium Dome, they are given a videotape of the performance to take home and treasure. Imagine their disappointment when, on getting home and watching the video, they have to sit through several minutes of trailers for Sky TV services before glimpsing their brief moment of fame. Fiendishly clever. </p> <p><strong>A few Choice words</strong> <br> The dirtiest catfight in telly, Terry Wogan v Stuart Murphy, splutters on in the letters column of BBC in-house organ Ariel. You may recall that in a letter to Ariel last week, BBC Choice head honcho Murphy launched a stout defence of the BBC following La Wogan's recent attack on the corporation, telling him he was \"living in a bizarre fantasy world of an Auntie's Bloomers script\". This week in Ariel, BBC broadcasting and presentation staffers Mark Thomas and Christina Dunley leapt to Wogan's defence, accusing Murphy of \"wanting us to work for a Stalinist BBC where employees dare not utter any criticism of their masters\". The pair conclude: \"Let's face it Stuart, Choice has never delivered on the promise of its name... the sooner BBC3 rises from its ashes the better.\" Miaow!</p> <p><strong>Don't talk at Talk</strong><br> The queen of New York publishing, Tina Brown, is giving Brits abroad a bad name. Staff members at Talk magazine have been told not to approach Ms Brown directly with ideas or questions, as their input is \"driving her crazy\". New York magazine reports gleefully that the new rule is that editorial director [Bob Wallace] or his direct underling [Perry van der Meer] must filter Tina's traffic. Wallace disputes the account, saying that while Van der Meer -- who worked under Brown at The New Yorker -- was brought in recently to streamline the editorial process, \"anyone can still come to Tina and me or e-mail us at any time about any issue. And believe me, they do.\" The New York Times' source notes sorrowfully: \"No one wants to hear that they're driving their boss crazy.\" Ms Brown is in England on holiday.</p> <p><strong>Croaky name?</strong><br> It's official: advertising agency names are getting sillier. First there was Mother - the trendy, Clerkenwell-based agency that looks after Harvey Nichols and Hoegaarden Beer. Then the disgraced political lobbyist Derek Draper launched an ad agency and mysteriously decided to call it Farm. Now Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse - a company that's surely old enough to know better - has appointed an agency called Strawberry Frog to handle its ads. It makes you long for the good old days, when adland was full of egotists who called their agencies after themselves, and had done with it.</p> <p><strong>A little unfortunate</strong><br> Marks &amp; Spencer has been trying to do its bit for normal women by using unusually curvaceous models (to put it politely) in its new ad campaign. So it was unfortunate that only the day before the distinctly uncurvy Tara Palmer-Tomkinson appeared on the front page of the Daily Mail as the new face of Splendour.com - a lingerie-selling website in which M&amp;S has a stake. A small case of double standards, perhaps?</p> <p><strong>No small beer</strong><br> Far be it from us to suggest that anyone in advertising takes the whole business of making ads too seriously. But the reaction of Heineken international marketing manager Frazer Thompson to the French ban on alcohol ads may have been a little extreme. \"In France the world has gone dark,\" said a grief-stricken Thompson. </p> <p>Email the Media Monkey at <a href=\"mailto:monkey@mediatheguardian.com\">Monkey@mediatheguardian.com</a></p>",

A memo went round Haymarket Publishing's offices today with the following unmissable offer for all Michael Heseltine's minions: \"Haymarket has a quantity of Michael Heseltine's book, \"Life in the Jungle\", published today, at the special price of \u00a310.\" The lines to Hezza's office must be jammed. Wise words Andrew Neil, speaking at the recent People and Profits in the New Economy conference: \"If you have trouble with recruitment and retention, then your company sucks.\" Could that be the same Andrew Neil who has recently had quite a lot of trouble with staff retention at the Scotsman? Your words, Andrew, not ours. Mo better box Word that retiring Labour MP St Mo of Mowlam is considering a TV career has got Media Monkey flicking through its contacts book in search of old broadcasting muckers who may be able to help out. The first call will undoubtedly be to the ITV Network Centre, where they are still a chief executive short of a full ITV Council. St Mo would be the ideal candidate - after all, she has plenty of experience of a job where people are always knifing you in the back. But Media Monkey would welcome other suggestions... \"Nasty\" Nick snapped Media Monkey is certain the Sun, as the official Big Brother newspaper, will be gagging to get its hands on some photos reportedly doing the rounds, which show \"Nasty\" Nick Bateman in his first public clinch with a member of the opposite sex since being evicted from the house of two-way mirrors. The offending snaps, taken outside the Met Bar after the TV Quick awards on Tuesday night (September 4), are said to feature Nick in a warm embrace with, er... go-getting Sun TV reporter Emily Smith. All in the line of duty, no doubt. Sky's the limit Does the low cunning of the BSkyB marketing department know no bounds? Imagine little Johnnie and Jemima's delight when, after a spot of bulletin reading courtesy of Sky News during their visit to the Millennium Dome, they are given a videotape of the performance to take home and treasure. Imagine their disappointment when, on getting home and watching the video, they have to sit through several minutes of trailers for Sky TV services before glimpsing their brief moment of fame. Fiendishly clever. A few Choice words The dirtiest catfight in telly, Terry Wogan v Stuart Murphy, splutters on in the letters column of BBC in-house organ Ariel. You may recall that in a letter to Ariel last week, BBC Choice head honcho Murphy launched a stout defence of the BBC following La Wogan's recent attack on the corporation, telling him he was \"living in a bizarre fantasy world of an Auntie's Bloomers script\". This week in Ariel, BBC broadcasting and presentation staffers Mark Thomas and Christina Dunley leapt to Wogan's defence, accusing Murphy of \"wanting us to work for a Stalinist BBC where employees dare not utter any criticism of their masters\". The pair conclude: \"Let's face it Stuart, Choice has never delivered on the promise of its name... the sooner BBC3 rises from its ashes the better.\" Miaow! Don't talk at Talk The queen of New York publishing, Tina Brown, is giving Brits abroad a bad name. Staff members at Talk magazine have been told not to approach Ms Brown directly with ideas or questions, as their input is \"driving her crazy\". New York magazine reports gleefully that the new rule is that editorial director [Bob Wallace] or his direct underling [Perry van der Meer] must filter Tina's traffic. Wallace disputes the account, saying that while Van der Meer -- who worked under Brown at The New Yorker -- was brought in recently to streamline the editorial process, \"anyone can still come to Tina and me or e-mail us at any time about any issue. And believe me, they do.\" The New York Times' source notes sorrowfully: \"No one wants to hear that they're driving their boss crazy.\" Ms Brown is in England on holiday. Croaky name? It's official: advertising agency names are getting sillier. First there was Mother - the trendy, Clerkenwell-based agency that looks after Harvey Nichols and Hoegaarden Beer. Then the disgraced political lobbyist Derek Draper launched an ad agency and mysteriously decided to call it Farm. Now Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse - a company that's surely old enough to know better - has appointed an agency called Strawberry Frog to handle its ads. It makes you long for the good old days, when adland was full of egotists who called their agencies after themselves, and had done with it. A little unfortunate Marks &amp; Spencer has been trying to do its bit for normal women by using unusually curvaceous models (to put it politely) in its new ad campaign. So it was unfortunate that only the day before the distinctly uncurvy Tara Palmer-Tomkinson appeared on the front page of the Daily Mail as the new face of Splendour.com - a lingerie-selling website in which M&amp;S has a stake. A small case of double standards, perhaps? No small beer Far be it from us to suggest that anyone in advertising takes the whole business of making ads too seriously. But the reaction of Heineken international marketing manager Frazer Thompson to the French ban on alcohol ads may have been a little extreme. \"In France the world has gone dark,\" said a grief-stricken Thompson.

All senior politicians in the party will be wondering about their position, conscious that another term may see them out.

It remains possible, thanks to the mistaken decision in 1997, that the economic facts will not match the political moment, or that the economic imperative fails to bring forth the necessary political courage.

Facing this discomfort will be two leaders in whom the decision will twitch contrasting nerves.</p> <p>To Mr Brown, historically a pro-Europe man, euro-entry may not seem like the supreme test of his life as a politician. Important, but not critical. He has an economic record to protect, and an independence which he values. He sees the economic risks of going in, which turn out to impress him more than they used to. He also sees the political damage he might do himself. He is, after all, the darling of the euro-sceptic press, which he would like to remain. Moreover, even if he was prepared to sacrifice that and vote for entry which was then achieved, and even if - oh juiciest hope! - he eventually satisfied the ambition that this is all about and took Blair's position, might he not then find himself prime minister at the time of greatest difficulty, say around 2005, when the transition from sterling to euro was being most harshly felt?</p> <p>This isn't to say that Brown will oppose the euro. Nobody, probably including him, knows what he will do. But perspectives alter. Very many British politicians have changed their minds about the EU or the euro or both. When Robin Cook, now one of the two staunchest senior advocates of euro-entry, heard Brown telling the cabinet about the 1997 decision, he rejoiced at the sight of the europhiles being put down. Brown's people have already been heard suggesting that a referendum shouldn't be held unless a 70% yes vote is assured. An outlook narrowly framed by ambition and growing agnosticism could pull Brown's judgment in one direction.</p> <p>To Mr Blair, the choice will look different. He's well aware of every economic hazard. He thinks it is touch and go whether economic convergence will be demonstrable at the right political time. But his horizons are much wider than Brown's. So is his picture of the role Britain ought to play in Europe and the world. So, for sure, is the pain he will feel if he recoils from putting the matter to the question and, as a result, spends the second half of his prime ministership watching Britain's entire European relationship weaken, and her foreign policy begin to disintegrate. That prospect bothers him - dominates his thinking - while Brown has more personal impulses to satisfy.</p> <p>This is a combustible mismatch of political material. The burn will be a slow one.

Blair's strongest riposte to the problem Brown presents, which would be to transfer him from the Treasury, is unlikely to happen. Besides, the Tory rout may yet be big enough to make them jointly see that the euro question has to be asked. In a referendum, Brown couldn't afford to be anything but full-hearted for a yes.</p> <p>But their conflicted interests, in certain circumstances, would be real. Politics is seldom a forum for fraternal love. Tactics and personality can be every bit as incendiary as philosophical disagreement. The lesson of 1997 isn't that such bloody combat shouldn't happen. It's always likely to, and to talk about constitutional crisis is fatuous. The lesson is that next time, in 2001 or 2, the prime minister should not be defeated. Still less should he be sidelined, as Andrew Rawnsley correctly has him at the start. He won't be.

Three weeks ago I'd have ducked for cover if a patient sneezed on me: today I almost forgot to wash my hands after a rectal examination on a constipated diabetic, and my generally jovial manner took a bit of a bashing when the rota coordinator called me up to tell me about a little error they had made before we arrived, which somehow involves me working next Saturday at less than a week's notice.

It's not. </p> <p>Once you're here we give you all the horrible infections that the patient two beds away came in with, many of which can only be treated by the antibiotics that they will invent in the year 2007: then you get diarrhoea from the antibiotics, which throws off your mental function, and before you know it you can't make it to the loo on your own any more and you're on the month long waiting list for a nursing home. I do my bit by washing my hands between patients, but as far as I can tell these bugs have wings. For God's sake, get your parents out of hospital. </p> <p>The other thing they tend not to mention in the textbooks is that nothing works like they say in the textbooks. For example: there are 50-year-olds who cycle to work every day, and then there are 50-year-olds who smoke in front of the telly. Despite it all, I go through my (painfully) thorough routine on every patient I see in casualty, but for anything other than the barn-door classics the patterns of symptom and sign bear no relation to anything from medical school, and whatever the cause, you can generally see the ones that are going to be fine and the ones that are in for the distance from the moment you walk into the cubicle. </p> <p>The strange thing is, despite my crippling lack of confidence (but you should see me exuding the stuff), the more I am left alone the more competent I seem to become. My consultant is away at a conference. My SHO is on nights. I do ward rounds on my own, I make management decisions that even my monster of a research registrar (the nice one is on holiday) manages not to publicly ridicule, and sometimes I do a bit of good. Even the stroppiest nurses have stopped treating my requests for a quick set of patient observations as a class war issue. </p> <p>Ah, stroppiness: sometimes it feels like it's everywhere around me, and the worst of it is that I have become a purveyor of the stuff myself, despite my better judgement. It's the inescapability of the work. What were previously isolated little puddles of labour seem to be joining up into vast oceans of drudgery, and I never seem to be away from the hospital for more than four hours at a time. I live in a small concrete bunker 15 yards away from my ward, and whenever I return home from an evening out, my route takes me right past the main doors of the casualty department. </p> <p>With this, together with the all-nighters in casualty every five days, and the time-warp effect of spending your every moment on and off the job in a hospital that never sleeps, the days are melting into one another. I used to pride myself on being pretty good at sleep deprivation, but that was when I was a student, and I could award myself a day off to recover after a heavy revision session.

      "body": "<p>No one looks cool jogging. And no one looks clever (although they may well look big). The fact is that, for anyone who doesn't jog, jogging is for mugs. Saddos. The kind of people who freak out when they finish their 800th sit-up and find that someone is using the gym machine that they were planning to use next (which means - gasp - messing with their gym programme). </p> <p>If you don't jog, jogging is also, quite simply, impossible. When you do run for a couple of minutes - when needs really must - you find yourself beetroot-red in the face, slick with sweat and barely able to breathe. It is disgusting, painful and undignified. And if in a two-minute dash to a bus stop you can be reduced to such a revolting wreck, what would happen in four minutes? Or even 10? How can it be physically possible to run for 20, which is how long they say (laugh) \"beginners\" should jog for? </p> <p>I jog now, very slowly, but very definitely and sort of regularly (in a random kind of way), and I enjoy it. Or at least feel smug and energetic and quite holy for having done it. I don't care that people tease me for shuffling along so slowly or for chatting so much while I shuffle. I am a jogging evangelist: I think it is the best exercise anyone could possibly do and I think that it has a more profound impact on your body than anything else you can do. If you want to get fit, lose weight or chill out, there's nothing better. </p> <p>There will always be people who preach the evils of jogging - we've all heard about dedicated joggers dropping dead in their running shoes at the age of 50 - but in last week's British Medical Journal, Danish researchers said that their study of 20,000 people showed that regular joggers are far less likely to die prematurely than non-joggers. </p> <p>So it's good for you. But how to start? I'll never forget how hard it was at the beginning: gazing up at an Everest-scape of sweat and panting, and knowing that I would never be able to do it and that even if I did it would be terminally boring. The start of me and my jogging came roughly seven years after I had last done any credible form of exercise (hockey, at school), when I joined a gym and was \"inducted\". They looked at me and pinched the skin on my ribs and hips with calipers and asked if I smoked (I lied) and was told off for having drunk a coffee before coming for my induction (they smelt it on my breath - at four paces!). Then I was asked to climb on and off a box a few times. \"D'you know what?\" the woman said, looking at her stopwatch. \"Let's leave the fitness test until later, a few months or so - it will be more encouraging that way.\" </p> <p>Then she took me around the machines and gave me a list of exercises, with a note of how long I should do each for. After five minutes of cycling as a warm-up, my chief task was to spend about 15 minutes on a running machine. Walking for two minutes, jogging for two minutes, walking for two minutes... </p> <p>And so I began. To get to the end of each two minutes of jogging was definitely on the vile side of OK, but it wasn't impossible. There was no minimum speed limit: I blobbed along awkwardly, vaguely shame-faced, at walking pace. And the two minutes of walking in between was fine. I was on a running machine, for God's sake, and I had a tailor-made gym programme: I was on the road to health and fitness. Years of smoking, drinking and sloth neatly expunged. </p> <p>For the next three months or so, I stuck rigidly to my \"running\" routine. I went to the gym three times a week, pretty much, and I did my two minutes jogging, two minutes walking... Slowly, it became easy. I stopped going red in the face and I stopped feeling uncomfortable. The woman in the gym persuaded me to buy proper shoes (those expensive cross trainer things) and a proper jogging bra (if you can breathe or look as if you still have breasts, it is not tight enough), but I refused a further instruction session: there was no need. I was on the road: it was go, go, go. </p> <p>Then one morning a friend joined me at the gym. Not a fitness freak but an ordinary woman. I watched her jog, next to me, for 16 minutes. No backchat, no fuss, no comment. No, \"Look, I am jogging. I am running. I am a hero.\" When I got off, at the end of my programme, she continued for another four minutes, but said nothing about it. She did not take me aside and say, \"I have just jogged for 20 minutes. My life will never be the same again.\" </p> <p>It was then I realised that the jogging-walking thing was over. Jogging is like a relationship, the woman in the gym said, and a relationship is, she went on, very much like a shark: if it's not moving forward, it's dead in the water. </p> <p>It was time to take the next step: continuous jogging. A big, long chunk of continuous jogging. At walking pace, clearly, but continuous. First four minutes, then six minutes... all very dull. Much duller than two minutes. It was during this period that I took the big step off the running machine and into the outside. I went for \"a run\" in the park. The first thing I noticed was how much faster the time went by outside. Ducks, swans, leaves, dog shit, pedestrians, people on roller blades, other joggers (how quickly they all went); a world of amusement to keep my mind from my watch. Within a month I was going for 20-minute runs. About 30 minutes door to door, with walking at each end. No equipment, no fuss and bother getting to a gym. No faffing about. </p> <p>Enter another friend, a regular jogger. He watched me run (walking alongside me) and said that there was no point in going so slowly. It was doing me no good at all. I wasn't sweating and I wasn't getting out of breath and all I was really doing was walking in a sort of jogging motion. Which was better than doing nothing, but probably not quite as good as walking quickly in a normal fashion. </p> <p>And so it came to pass: I speeded up. Not so many people would notice, but just a bit. Just a bit so that I was sort of running, really, although very slowly, rather than walking. A major breakthrough. </p> <p>A marathon-running friend of my mother told me not long afterwards that I was doing fine. She said not to listen too much to macho male joggers anyway: they all had their own theories, and most of them were rubbish. She said the secret was to never run at a speed that it was uncomfortable to chat at. Gradually the speed at which I could comfortably chat would increase, and every now and then I should simply consider speeding up a bit, just to see if I could. </p> <p> About eight months into my new life as a jogger, I returned to the gym for my fitness test. I was weighed and found that without ever actually getting unpleasantly tired or ever having gasped for breath, I had lost about eight pounds. The woman strapped wires to me while I cycled and said I was on the \"very fit\" bit of the scale. (A dodgy scale, undoubtedly, but thrilling all the same.) </p> <p>And just like that, I was a new woman. I could run for buses without breaking into a sweat. When I tested it, I found that having broken through the 20-minute barrier, I could comfortably blob along for an hour without any bother at all. </p> <p>People complain that if they run they get sore knees or bad hips, or pains in their shins, but I suspect they're simply running too fast and too long, on unforgiving surfaces, such as Tarmac, and failing to chat enough. I can't imagine that my 20 minutes spent scuffing up the grass, two or three times a week, is seriously going to damage me. </p> <p>My love of jogging is now about three years old and naturally, the love is prone to dips. For the past four months, I've barely been out to the park once a week. But somehow, it doesn't matter. The point is now that however slack I am, however long I leave between runs, I can still go out and jog for 20 minutes, and feel better for it. I know that the difference between slothdom and fitness is just a few gentle jogs away. Having overcome the horror of it that once, I know it will never be that hard again. </p> <p>And the best of it, the very best of it, is that not only is jogging free, but you can do it anywhere - along a mountain ridge, barefoot on a beach - wherever you find yourself. </p> <p><strong>Best foot forward: how to get started</strong></p> <p>\u0095 Before you start, walk for a while or, if you're in a gym, do a few minutes cycling, just to warm up your muscles. </p> <p>\u0095 After the warm-up do about five minutes of gentle stretches. Get someone to come up with a routine for you if you have no idea how to start. Don't forget to stretch your arms, back and sides - jogging isn't just about your legs. </p> <p>\u0095 Start jogging slowly. You cannot start too slowly. Don't worry about feeling silly. </p> <p>\u0095 Alternate jogging with walking, until you feel happy leaving out the walking bits. </p> <p>\u0095 In the first weeks, jog or walk-jog for not more than about 15 or 20 minutes at a time. At first, twice a week is plenty. Later you can up it to three times a week (after about four sessions, though, you're in danger of becoming a freak). </p> <p>\u0095 The right kit is essential. You have to buy trainers that are specifically designed for jogging, ideally for both outside and inside a gym. And if you start jogging regularly, you're meant to buy a new pair every six months. For women, an ordinary bra will not do. You need something that squishes your breasts against your ribcage and holds them completely still while you run. Anything else is a grave error. Other than that, you can wear anything you don't mind getting sweaty and doesn't restrict your movement or chafe your skin. </p> <p>\u0095 If your muscles hurt or you have any sharp pains or complaints, don't jog. Likewise if you're clinically obese. Do something more gentle, like swimming or brisk walking. </p> <p>\u0095 Remember that just because you are a champion swimmer or a worldclass climber, doesn't mean you're going to find jogging easy. You only train for what you train for: every sport uses a different set of muscles.</p>",

For women, an ordinary bra will not do. You need something that squishes your breasts against your ribcage and holds them completely still while you run. Anything else is a grave error. Other than that, you can wear anything you don't mind getting sweaty and doesn't restrict your movement or chafe your skin. \u0095 If your muscles hurt or you have any sharp pains or complaints, don't jog. Likewise if you're clinically obese. Do something more gentle, like swimming or brisk walking. \u0095 Remember that just because you are a champion swimmer or a worldclass climber, doesn't mean you're going to find jogging easy. You only train for what you train for: every sport uses a different set of muscles.",

      "body": "<p><strong> Afternoon nap is a must </strong></p> <p> I am 18 and am about to go to university to study medicine and I am concerned about the amount I am sleeping throughout the day. For about a year I have been sleeping in the afternoons for anything up to an hour. I have a regular sleeping pattern and normally have about eight hours' rest a day, but I am concerned that if I don't break this habit I could have problems concentrating in late afternoon lectures or exams. Is my sleeping pattern healthy? </p> <p>\u0095 As everyone in Mediterranean countries knows, an afternoon siesta is a marvellous thing. Our bodies are programmed to sleep at night and stay awake all day but an energy dip in the early afternoon is very common. Unfortunately, you may find your medical school unable to accommodate a post- lunch nap. Tips to enhance afternoon alertness include eating a hearty breakfast but smaller lunch. Avoid too much refined carbohydrate at lunchtime because that floods your body with sugar which cases an insulin surge which in turn lowers your blood sugar levels within a couple of hours. Exercise every day, avoid caffeinated drinks after 6pm and try to limit the alcohol intake so you get a good night's sleep. Speak to your tutor or student health doctor if you're feeling excessively tired. You'll manage without your afternoon nap as we all do, but that doesn't mean you won't miss it! </p> <p><strong> An infernal itch</strong></p> <p> I am 88 and in good health. However, I am plagued by an infernal itching around my vulva and back passage which is keeping me awake at night and making me very uncomfortable when I sit for long periods in the day. My GP said it was probably age-related dryness and gave me some oestrogen cream which didn't help. Any advice? </p> <p>\u0095 Water and chemicals may be exacerbating the itch so wash infrequently and avoid using all toiletries and creams on the itchy area. Cut your fingernails short so you can't scratch yourself raw. An antihistamine such as Piriton which is available without prescription can be taken at night to lessen the itch. Your GP needs to examine you properly and refer you to a gynaecologist if necessary to make sure there is no underlying skin problem of the vulva. A fairly common condition called lichen sclerosis causes white scarred areas on the vulva and usually improves with a strong steroid ointment such as Dermovate. Vulval itching may be part of a more widespread skin condition such as eczema or psoriasis. If you are itchy all over with no apparent skin problem, you may have an underlying problem such as diabetes or anaemia which can be diagnosed by a simple blood test. </p> <p> <strong> Tormented by tinnitus </strong> </p> <p> I have suffered from intermittent ringing in the ears (tinnitus) for many years and have spent thousands of pounds in search of a cure. Is there any solid evidence for specific treatments that work before I waste any more money? </p> <p>\u0095 The sad fact is that there is very little good evidence of effective treatments for this debilitating condition. The best evidence supports the use of betahistine during attacks of Meniere's disease which causes tinnitus, dizziness and lack of balance though it doesn't help the gradual hearing loss that may occur with successive attacks. There is some evidence to support antidepressants such as amitriptyline and a valium-type drug called alprazolam but both may cause side effects. A technique which uses electrical stimulation over the ear may be worth a try but there's no real evidence for acupuncture, biofeedback, hypnosis and Ginko. A lot of work needs to be carried out in this under-funded field. </p> <p>\u0095 These answers are intended to be as accurate and full as possible, but should never be used as a substitute for visiting a doctor and seeking medical help. If you have a question for Dr Robinson, email <a href=\"mailto:drann@dircon.co.uk\">drann@dircon.co.uk</a> or write to her c/o The Health Editor, The Guardian, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER.

      "body": "<p>I can't remember when I started to pull out my hair. I remember certain episodes, stills that are framed in my mind: a young girl sitting at her desk in a Portakabin classroom at Christmas time. She is having trouble with an exam question and her mind wanders. When she finally looks back down she finds the paper covered in long, mousey-brown individual hairs, stuck to the page by their wet roots. Unable to blow the hairs away from the paper, she pulls each individually from the page and hopes no one notices. </p> <p>Another: coming home from school, Mum's horrified look when she discovers the almost perfect circular bald patch that had appeared on the crown of my head. The talk of ringworm and quickly being taken to see a tricholigist. When he asked me if I had been pulling out my hair I don't know how I reacted. I knew I had been pulling out my hair, but I had somehow managed to remove the normal, never-had-any-problems-girl from the 11-year-old who had started to rip out her hair one at a time so that she now had a bald patch. What I do remember, and it would come back on many occasions to mock me, were the words of my mother: \"Oh what a relief - I thought it could have been something serious. We will be able to sort this out in no time, won't we darling?\" </p> <p>I am now 25 and almost totally bald. For the past 15 years I have suffered the humiliating ignominy of being sent back to school with scarves instead of hair, cheap pudding bowl type wigs that scratched and bothered, scared of the wind, scared of swimming pools, scared of boys. For the rest of my school career I retreated into myself. I recently heard an old school friend describing me as \"painfully shy at school\" and it is not an unfair comment. </p> <p>No one really knew how to help. It was a problem rarely come across and although compared to other OCDs (obsessive compulsive disorders) hair-pulling somehow seemed foreign. </p> <p>During my school years I was paraded in front of all sorts of child psychologists, psychiatrists, hypnotists, acupuncturists and doctors who fed me large amounts of Prozac, all determined to stop my bizarre behaviour. My parents were desperate to help but were unsure where to start. I remember sitting in front of one such child psychologist who specialised in bulimia and thinking, why am I here? I don't want to make myself sick and I am sure a bulimic doesn't want to tear her hair out. We don't share the same desires so why should we share the same treatment? There were the the constant references to my childhood - the searching for a single event or problem that might explain my strange behaviour. It was as if they needed to tick a box before they could move on. Homesickness and a dislike of boarding school were simply not good enough. </p> <p>No one specialised in trichotillomania (the medical word given to hair-pulling), which added to the feeling of isolation. I did not have one of the more fashionable teenage problems such as anorexia or bulimia for which there were hundreds of Harley Street doctors, all trained to deal with precisely your problem. I am not saying that what I had was worse, because it wasn't - for a start it didn't threaten my life - but not knowing a single other person with the same problem increased the mental sense of being an outsider. I was unable to explain my motives and the craving that lay behind my addiction. Anorexia and bulimia are fuelled, initially, by a desire to make oneself more attractive by losing weight. What I was doing, and I suppose still am, is the opposite; a woman without hair is hardly attractive. </p> <p>I call it an addiction because that is what I believe it is. When I am tense and need to pull out my hair I try to keep my mind on other things, try to ignore it, pushing the urge to pull to the back of my mind. But the need is too great and merely increases, my whole body tightens like screws until I crack. There is an instant feeling of relief followed by self-disgust. </p> <p>While at university I decided to shave off what was left of my hair in the hope that it would deter me from pulling but this was not so. I found that even with a shaved head, after a day or two of not shaving, my hair would again be long enough to pull out with tweezers. If I had lost my tweezers I would resort to driving to all-night chemists in order to buy some more and satisfy my craving. Slowly it was not only my hair that I attacked but also my eyebrows that became victim to my craving. </p> <p>Thanks to numerous realistic wigs, colourful scarves and wonderfully understanding friends, I have managed to limit the extent to which I allow my hair (or lack of it) to affect my life. But I do want to stop and when I think of the future it scares me. I don't want my children to have to explain to inquisitive friends why their mother doesn't have hair. I don't always want to worry when it's windy, feel embarrassed when the subject of hair is brought up by colleagues at work, explain to concerned strangers that, no, I don't have cancer but that I pull my hair out and watch as their expression changes. </p> <p>However many times I am reassured by friends and family that my lack of hair doesn't matter I know that in the long run they, particularly my boyfriend, want me to stop and look forward to when I have my own hair instead of an assortment of wigs and scarves. They see this period of my life as being only temporary and are waiting for me to move on. I, on the other hand, can't remember a time when I had a full head of hair. There have been brief interludes over the past 15 years when I have stopped for a couple of months, my hair grows back and I have felt relatively normal again. Then something triggers the impulse to pull and as soon as that first hair comes out the rest follow in a frenzy, an almost mad sense to totally rid my head of hair followed by pangs of guilt and lack of self-worth. Pulling my hair out is what I know, so intrinsically part of me that I can hardly imagine what it would be like to be free of the desire to tear individual hairs from my head. </p> <p>I know there are a few organisations that do try and help people who pull out their hair. I have tried to contact one or two but found my letters unanswered. Perhaps the lack of patients precipitates closure. Despite statistics that show that 2% to 4% of people in the US pull out their hair, the causes and treatment of trichotillomania have not yet been thoroughly addressed. Unsurprisingly, although numerous support groups and websites have sprung up in the US, in the UK the number of people that understand the true nature of the problem - and are able to offer help and advice - are few and far between. </p> <p>I hope that one day when a young girl finds her exam papers covered in her own hair she will be able to get help, to talk to someone who really understands what she is doing and may just be able to halt the craving before it goes on to affect the rest of her life.</p>",

Mind you, we are not short of foolish senior citizens of culture puff-puffing in.\" He said Naipaul could not be trusted as a commentator on popular culture because he was \"on record\" as saying he did not read contemporary novels, and probably did not go to the theatre or watch television; the experience of Drummond did not extend far beyond opera and classical music; and Tusa was \"the same\". In the future, the voice of the young Elvis Presley would be treasured over the young Luciano Pavarotti, Lord Bragg suggested. \"You don't know what is going to turn up; these guys are not looking hard enough to find it.\" Lord Bragg, the controller of arts and features at LWT, went on to say that ITV should not be tempted to specialise as a purely entertainment-based channel as digital competition intensifies. \"We must and can do what we do better than the mono-channels and be the button of choice, as well as the channel of the nation.\" This season's South Bank Show includes a profile of Marilyn Monroe by the novelist Joyce Carol Oates, and programmes on the singer Tom Jones, choreographer Mark Morris, novelist George MacDonald Fraser, artist Marc Quinn and organist Gillian Weir.",

But then, eventually, if you're lucky, you may come across a nursery that clearly looks as if the prime purpose of the enterprise is not warehousing children while mothers and fathers clock up the hours in work but fostering each individual child's happiness and well-being. You may well have struck gold. </p> <p>Nursery provision - especially for the under threes - is in trouble. On Thursday, the Professional Association of Nursery Nurses (Pann), will chair a conference, attended by a number of national childcare organisations, to discuss their deep concerns about the regulation of the industry (now inspected by Ofsted using, say critics, inspectors with little childcare experience); recruitment and the new government proposals on national care standards. </p> <p>Tricia Pritchard, professional officer at Pann, says: \"The government should be investing in training, developing a career ladder, improving salaries, tightening regulations and attracting the right quality of person into childcare. Instead, it is dropping standards and implying from its present recruitment campaign that virtually anyone can do the job. All that's required is to \"like children\". That view wipes clean our years of effort to make the profession much more than an option, alongside hairdressing, for low achievers with no aspiration. What we want to say to the government is that you've got it wrong. If children really matter, think again.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile in Scotland, 5,000 nursery nurses, members of the trade union Unison, have been on strike over pay. The majority of nursery nurses are women - add to that the disgracefully low value attached to all employment concerned with the business of care, and the result is a low salary and a non-existent career structure so there is little opportunity, no matter how well qualified, to earn more. Barbara Foubister, for instance, has been a nursery nurse for 32 years. She works in an Edinburgh school nursery and earns \u00a312,100. Salaries in the private sector in the rest of the UK are just as low - between \u00a39,000 and \u00a315,000. </p> <p>This matters to parents because it translates into high turnover of staff (up to 30%) and little motivation to develop skills - over half childcare staff are unqualified. Professionals hoped that the government would push for all staff to be qualified, within a five-year target, the majority up to the equivalent of an NNEB (a two-year course). Instead, under the government's proposals (the consultation period ends next month - time for parents to lobby their MPs), it suggests that only half the staff have NVQ level 2, (acquired in a matter of months); the remainder may be unqualified while a manager requires no experience. \"That means an 18-year-old could run a nursery,\" says one nursery owner. \"Is that what we really want for our children? The implications are frightening.\" </p> <p>While the debate about whether it's \"good\", or at least not \"bad\", for a baby to go into daycare is unresolved, what have been established are the factors that contribute to high-quality nursery provision for the under-fours. A report for the Thomas Coram Research Unit established that what matters is the childcare workers' education, training and working conditions; sensitive and responsive adult-child interactions; stability and continuity of care; strong regulation and the adult-to-child ratios. Very little of which will be achieved if the new proposals are accepted. </p> <p>The government is in a difficult dilemma. To its credit, Labour has made childcare a public and political issue - offering, for instance, financial support through the Working Family Tax Credit and funding after-school clubs. It has also required local authorities to conduct annual audits of childcare requirements and establish 150 Early Years Development and Childcare Partnerships, bringing together public, private and voluntary sectors. </p> <p>A wide range of childcare and early learning facilities - nurseries offering day care from three months to five; nursery schools for three- to five-year-olds; childminders, nannies - is, of course, crucial to Labour's determination to reduce the benefits bill and tackle poverty. Its goal has accelerated the influx of mothers into the workplace . Now, 55% of mothers with a youngest child under five are economically active while two-thirds of those on maternity leave return to work within six months. Two out of three rely on informal childcare but the demand for paid care is set to expand hugely. </p> <p>The country has 1.8m under-threes and a chronic shortage of provision. It is rumoured that the government will shortly set up a fund for under-threes to establish nurseries in areas where the childcare entrepreneurs can see no potential for profit. The private sector has already grown at a phenomenal 400% in the past decade. Still it only meets 2% of demand. At the same time, the number of community and local authority nurseries is shrinking. In June, the government launched a recruitment campaign to attract 83,000 childcarers into the profession by 2003. The concern is whether enough will have a genuine commitment to children. Or will they simply be in search of a wage? </p> <p>The opportunities to make a mint are obvious. Bad practitioners will ignore the challenge of how to boost salaries and professionalism while dealing with a skills shortage and the inability of many parents to pay more by providing what amounts to indifferent security guards for the young. Tragedies will occur and thousands of children will be made miserable. Other entrepreneurs, however, are more enlightened. They, too, are depressed by the government's proposals . </p> <p>John Woodward is a director of Busy Bees, a chain of 35 nurseries that trains its own staff . \"We could see 10 years ago that we were heading for a massive skills shortage,\" Woodward explains. \"It requires a long-term strategy - but what politician thinks in the long term?\" </p> <p>Child Base, also praised for good practice, has 24 nurseries (charging between \u00a3130 and \u00a3180 a week) and a turnover of over \u00a37m. Michael Thompson, the company's founder and chairman of the National Day Nurseries Association, says that in order to retain good-quality staff and instill a sense of vocation, the company offers training and a proper career structure. A regional director earns \u00a330,000-plus. The company has also introduced a pension scheme. All of which adds to the cost. So far, however, it's mainly parents and taxpayers who are meeting the bills. Should the employers do more? </p> <p>Some 80% of parents believe they should, and 75% of the UK's top 500 companies agree there is a recognised business case for family-friendly policies. HSBC, for instance, lost \u00a318m a year before the introduction of its childcare project. Still, only 3% offer workplace nurseries and 2% provide a voucher scheme (exempt from National Insurance) or a cash allowance. Few have been active in the Early Years Development and Childcare Partnerships. </p> <p>Employers need a shake-up. The Daycare Trust, the childcare campaigning charity, advocates that parents (especially those such as nurses, doctors and engineers who have clout because they have sought-after skills) should exert pressure. It also wants the government, for instance, to set targets for improved employer contributions to childcare costs. Mike Thompson also suggests the removal of VAT on the acquisition of new sites; a fresh look at business rates and childcare costs treated as a non-taxable benefit (disliked by the Treasury.) </p> <p>High-quality nursery care gives a child a positive start in life regardless of whether parents are in work or at home. We have yet to learn the consequences of exposing thousands to care that is truly dire. \"The ideal is a decent nursery in every community just as we expect a primary school and a GP,\" says Collette Kelleher of The Daycare Trust. \"The government has invested an enormous amount but the real danger now is that it may see childcare as a ticked box, when the task has only just begun.

      "body": "<p>The highly regarded B-movie film director, Joseph H Lewis, who has died aged 100, was born in New York. The year? It was either 1900 or 1907, with the earlier date most favoured by reference books, the American Film Institute and British Film Institute. However, the later date has gained credibility, with the suggestion that Lewis added years to his age on entering the movie business in the hope of gaining a more senior post.</p> <p>In fact, he joined MGM as a camera loader in the early 1920s, either as a teenager or aged 23. He stayed in the business until the late 1960s, latterly working in television. His career as a movie director lasted just 21 years from 1937, and, during that period, he also served in the US Army Signal Corps. He directed more than 40 films.</p> <p>All except one of these were B-movies, often destined for the lower half of double bills. As his career progressed, Lewis moved to bigger budgets, but still directed genre flicks, considered at the time to be run-of-the-mill thrillers or westerns. His film career ended in 1958, as Hollywood, battling the inroads of television, turned increasingly to the wide screen and blockbusters, and the double bill became obsolete.</p> <p>The style of film at which Lewis had excelled became the staple diet of television - action and genre pieces to fill the greedy air waves instead of local cinemas. For 10 years, he joined the enemy, working on the Lloyd Bridges Show, the Zane Grey Theatre and A Man Called Shenandoah. He directed the pilot of Branded in 1965, and episodes of such popular series as Gunsmoke, The Big Valley, Law Of The Plainsman and The Rifleman. His television work remains a coda to his busy, central years as a film director.</p> <p>After his retirement, Lewis, like other B-directors, was lionised by the French, and later by American, British and other critics. Many of his quickly-made works were reassessed. In the US, Paul Schrader helped influence his new-found reputation - largely based on one classic - and there were retrospectives of his career mounted, not least at the National Film Theatre, where Lewis also took part in a Guardian lecture. He proved himself exactly the amiable, tough, no-nonsense professional that his works suggest.</p> <p>Over the years, the works have resurfaced on television, on 16mm and in various retrospectives. Those on view confirm that there are indeed a handful of memorable films, plus a whole series of intelligent, entertaining works - mainly westerns. The rest remain in decent obscurity, although contemporary reviews invariably praise their originality, economy and ingenious camerawork. Lewis was no slouch.</p> <p>But, as the critic and film historian David Thomson remarked, \"There is no point in overpraising Lewis.\" He worked with limited resources, often with middling actors, on series product offering mundane scripts. He transcended the material - but his liveliness and technical skill only highlight the paucity of the material with which he worked.</p> <p>Still, we do not need to overpraise him to realise that, on occasion, he created small, beautifully crafted cinema. And a handful of these films are complex works that stand up infinitely better than the grandiose, over-blown epics that were the result of his fellow directors' move into A-features. The often flabby films of the 1960s and 1970s were a riposte to the undernourished budgets of television. At the time, they seemed a valid alternative; today, less so.</p> <p>After Lewis entered the studios, he stayed there for some 16 years in a variety of jobs. He worked as an assistant editor, second unit director and supervising editor on many films, including In Old Santa F\u00e9 (1934) and Ladies Crave Excitement (1935), as well as on popular 12- or 15-episode serials, such as Undersea Kingdom (1936). In that year, he also edited The Devil On Horseback, directed by Crane Wilbur, and, in 1937, co-directed Navy Spy, with Wilbur. After years of sturdy, invaluable experience, Lewis had graduated and, again in 1937, directed his d\u00e9but, Courage Of The West, quickly followed by Singing Outlaw.</p> <p>He made three films in 1938, including Border Wolves, described as a \"visual treat\". Within the next three years, he had notched up another dozen B-movies, mainly westerns such as The Man From Tumbleweeds (1940), and three films from the East End Kids series - Boys Of The City, That Gang Of Mine and Pride Of The Bowery. This busy pattern continued with product from studios more interested in quota than quality. The titles tell most of the story - such as Bombs Over Burma and Criminals Within. Among these mainly action pictures was an odd biopic, Minstrel Man (1944), about and starring Benny Fields. The following year, he directed a lively offering in the detective series, The Falcon, in San Francisco.</p> <p>Also in 1945, Lewis made his real breakthrough. My Name Is Julia Ross was his 25th directorial credit, and probably his best movie to that date. It is a brisk, slightly loopy example of film noir about a secretary (Nina Foch) who is kidnapped and held in a remote mansion by a demented boy (George Macready) and his mother (Dame May Whitty). It is not too fanciful to view this little chiller as a precursor to Hitchcock's masterly Psycho.</p> <p>Lewis followed this with another melodramatic thriller, So Dark The Night. He was now working for Columbia, the least of the major studios, but still more prestigious than his earlier employers. They gave him the task (probably because of Minstrel Man) of directing the musical numbers for the highly successful biopic, The Jolson Story. But the main credit went to Alfred E Green, and Lewis returned to B-pictures, working with the star of Jolson, Larry Parks, on The Swordsman.</p> <p>In 1948, he made The Return Of October, before returning to better form with a stylish and stylised crime story, Undercover Alan (1949), which led on to one of two acknowledged masterworks, Gun Crazy (1949). This is often compared favourably with Bonnie And Clyde, although in truth it is a noir gem best ranked with Nicholas Ray's They Live By Night. The story, of a doomed couple, plunged headlong into crime by an obsessional amour fou , is completely unsentimental. It is distinguished by fluid camera work, two brilliant set-piece robberies, and the driven performances of the young leads, John Dall and Peggy Cummins. The tragic ending closes the circular narrative as the non-violent hero fires blindly at the police and dies by the guns he has coveted as a small boy.</p> <p>The acclaim that turned Gun Crazy into a cult movie came much later, and Lewis continued with B-movies, although with technicians and actors of a higher calibre. His next work was an excellent melodrama, Lady With A Passport (1950), starring Hedy Lamarr, followed by the Korean-set war film, Retreat Hell! and Desperate Search (both 1952) and Cry Of The Hunted (1953).</p> <p>His subsequent film, The Big Combo (1954) has less of a reputation than Gun Crazy, but boasts even more distinguished camerawork (by the great John Alton) and a remarkable trio of heavyweight actors - Richard Conte, Brian Donleavy and Cornel Wilde. This claustrophobic, violent movie is superbly structured, and remains today a dark and cynical work. It is probably Lewis's most achieved and complex film.</p> <p>Apart from a short, Man On A Bus (1955), made for the United Jewish Appeal Fund, Lewis made only four more feature films before moving into television. Of these, 7th Cavalry (1956) is a modest western, starring Randolph Scott. Although not in the same league as the Scott-Boetticher westerns, it is an attractive, melancholy work.</p> <p>The remaining trio are rather more notable. A Lawless Street (1955) is distinguished by characteristically agile camerawork and a brisk narrative. The Halliday Brand (1957) is a psychological western with a dark tone, offering themes of racism, humiliation and an obsessive family. As usual, Lewis transcends his limited budget with visual flair and energy.</p> <p>T he following year, he directed Terror In A Texas Town, an attempt at an artistic wilful example of the genre. This odd western boasts an almost surreal climax as the hero, Sterling Hayden, seeks revenge, using his dead father's harpoon as a weapon of destruction. It was a flamboyant end to a film career that led to him becoming one of the most discussed of all B-movie directors.</p> <p>His best work stands alongside that of Edgar Ulmer, Budd Boetticher and Jacques Tourneur, as well as the earlier, better films of Edward Dmytryk, Blake Edwards and Richard Fleischer - before they and others allowed inflated budgets to inflate their egos and bank balances whilst deflating their talents. And while agreeing with Thomson that we should not overrate Lewis, we certainly need never underrate him and his like. There was an integrity, energy and skill that makes such craftsmen key figures in the history of popular crime films.</p> <p>He is survived by his wife Buena, and a daughter, Candy.</p> <p>\u0095 Joseph H Lewis, film and television director, born April 6 1900; died August 30 2000</p>",

      "bodyText": "The highly regarded B-movie film director, Joseph H Lewis, who has died aged 100, was born in New York. The year? It was either 1900 or 1907, with the earlier date most favoured by reference books, the American Film Institute and British Film Institute. However, the later date has gained credibility, with the suggestion that Lewis added years to his age on entering the movie business in the hope of gaining a more senior post. In fact, he joined MGM as a camera loader in the early 1920s, either as a teenager or aged 23. He stayed in the business until the late 1960s, latterly working in television. His career as a movie director lasted just 21 years from 1937, and, during that period, he also served in the US Army Signal Corps. He directed more than 40 films. All except one of these were B-movies, often destined for the lower half of double bills. As his career progressed, Lewis moved to bigger budgets, but still directed genre flicks, considered at the time to be run-of-the-mill thrillers or westerns. His film career ended in 1958, as Hollywood, battling the inroads of television, turned increasingly to the wide screen and blockbusters, and the double bill became obsolete. The style of film at which Lewis had excelled became the staple diet of television - action and genre pieces to fill the greedy air waves instead of local cinemas. For 10 years, he joined the enemy, working on the Lloyd Bridges Show, the Zane Grey Theatre and A Man Called Shenandoah. He directed the pilot of Branded in 1965, and episodes of such popular series as Gunsmoke, The Big Valley, Law Of The Plainsman and The Rifleman. His television work remains a coda to his busy, central years as a film director. After his retirement, Lewis, like other B-directors, was lionised by the French, and later by American, British and other critics. Many of his quickly-made works were reassessed. In the US, Paul Schrader helped influence his new-found reputation - largely based on one classic - and there were retrospectives of his career mounted, not least at the National Film Theatre, where Lewis also took part in a Guardian lecture. He proved himself exactly the amiable, tough, no-nonsense professional that his works suggest. Over the years, the works have resurfaced on television, on 16mm and in various retrospectives. Those on view confirm that there are indeed a handful of memorable films, plus a whole series of intelligent, entertaining works - mainly westerns. The rest remain in decent obscurity, although contemporary reviews invariably praise their originality, economy and ingenious camerawork. Lewis was no slouch. But, as the critic and film historian David Thomson remarked, \"There is no point in overpraising Lewis.\" He worked with limited resources, often with middling actors, on series product offering mundane scripts. He transcended the material - but his liveliness and technical skill only highlight the paucity of the material with which he worked. Still, we do not need to overpraise him to realise that, on occasion, he created small, beautifully crafted cinema. And a handful of these films are complex works that stand up infinitely better than the grandiose, over-blown epics that were the result of his fellow directors' move into A-features. The often flabby films of the 1960s and 1970s were a riposte to the undernourished budgets of television. At the time, they seemed a valid alternative; today, less so. After Lewis entered the studios, he stayed there for some 16 years in a variety of jobs. He worked as an assistant editor, second unit director and supervising editor on many films, including In Old Santa F\u00e9 (1934) and Ladies Crave Excitement (1935), as well as on popular 12- or 15-episode serials, such as Undersea Kingdom (1936). In that year, he also edited The Devil On Horseback, directed by Crane Wilbur, and, in 1937, co-directed Navy Spy, with Wilbur. After years of sturdy, invaluable experience, Lewis had graduated and, again in 1937, directed his d\u00e9but, Courage Of The West, quickly followed by Singing Outlaw. He made three films in 1938, including Border Wolves, described as a \"visual treat\". Within the next three years, he had notched up another dozen B-movies, mainly westerns such as The Man From Tumbleweeds (1940), and three films from the East End Kids series - Boys Of The City, That Gang Of Mine and Pride Of The Bowery. This busy pattern continued with product from studios more interested in quota than quality. The titles tell most of the story - such as Bombs Over Burma and Criminals Within. Among these mainly action pictures was an odd biopic, Minstrel Man (1944), about and starring Benny Fields. The following year, he directed a lively offering in the detective series, The Falcon, in San Francisco. Also in 1945, Lewis made his real breakthrough. My Name Is Julia Ross was his 25th directorial credit, and probably his best movie to that date. It is a brisk, slightly loopy example of film noir about a secretary (Nina Foch) who is kidnapped and held in a remote mansion by a demented boy (George Macready) and his mother (Dame May Whitty). It is not too fanciful to view this little chiller as a precursor to Hitchcock's masterly Psycho. Lewis followed this with another melodramatic thriller, So Dark The Night. He was now working for Columbia, the least of the major studios, but still more prestigious than his earlier employers. They gave him the task (probably because of Minstrel Man) of directing the musical numbers for the highly successful biopic, The Jolson Story. But the main credit went to Alfred E Green, and Lewis returned to B-pictures, working with the star of Jolson, Larry Parks, on The Swordsman. In 1948, he made The Return Of October, before returning to better form with a stylish and stylised crime story, Undercover Alan (1949), which led on to one of two acknowledged masterworks, Gun Crazy (1949). This is often compared favourably with Bonnie And Clyde, although in truth it is a noir gem best ranked with Nicholas Ray's They Live By Night. The story, of a doomed couple, plunged headlong into crime by an obsessional amour fou , is completely unsentimental. It is distinguished by fluid camera work, two brilliant set-piece robberies, and the driven performances of the young leads, John Dall and Peggy Cummins. The tragic ending closes the circular narrative as the non-violent hero fires blindly at the police and dies by the guns he has coveted as a small boy. The acclaim that turned Gun Crazy into a cult movie came much later, and Lewis continued with B-movies, although with technicians and actors of a higher calibre. His next work was an excellent melodrama, Lady With A Passport (1950), starring Hedy Lamarr, followed by the Korean-set war film, Retreat Hell! and Desperate Search (both 1952) and Cry Of The Hunted (1953). His subsequent film, The Big Combo (1954) has less of a reputation than Gun Crazy, but boasts even more distinguished camerawork (by the great John Alton) and a remarkable trio of heavyweight actors - Richard Conte, Brian Donleavy and Cornel Wilde. This claustrophobic, violent movie is superbly structured, and remains today a dark and cynical work. It is probably Lewis's most achieved and complex film. Apart from a short, Man On A Bus (1955), made for the United Jewish Appeal Fund, Lewis made only four more feature films before moving into television. Of these, 7th Cavalry (1956) is a modest western, starring Randolph Scott. Although not in the same league as the Scott-Boetticher westerns, it is an attractive, melancholy work. The remaining trio are rather more notable. A Lawless Street (1955) is distinguished by characteristically agile camerawork and a brisk narrative. The Halliday Brand (1957) is a psychological western with a dark tone, offering themes of racism, humiliation and an obsessive family. As usual, Lewis transcends his limited budget with visual flair and energy. T he following year, he directed Terror In A Texas Town, an attempt at an artistic wilful example of the genre. This odd western boasts an almost surreal climax as the hero, Sterling Hayden, seeks revenge, using his dead father's harpoon as a weapon of destruction. It was a flamboyant end to a film career that led to him becoming one of the most discussed of all B-movie directors. His best work stands alongside that of Edgar Ulmer, Budd Boetticher and Jacques Tourneur, as well as the earlier, better films of Edward Dmytryk, Blake Edwards and Richard Fleischer - before they and others allowed inflated budgets to inflate their egos and bank balances whilst deflating their talents. And while agreeing with Thomson that we should not overrate Lewis, we certainly need never underrate him and his like. There was an integrity, energy and skill that makes such craftsmen key figures in the history of popular crime films. He is survived by his wife Buena, and a daughter, Candy. \u0095 Joseph H Lewis, film and television director, born April 6 1900; died August 30 2000",

      "bodyText": "Peter Hillary, the explorer son of Sir Edmund Hillary - who conquered Everest in 1953 - is trying to ban a book about his failed expedition to the South Pole and back because it could ruin his mountaineering reputation. Hillary, a New Zealander, who took part in an ill-fated trip to the South Pole last year with fellow explorers Australians Eric Philips and Jon Muir, is trying to prevent publication of the book which gives a detailed account of the gruelling 84-day journey. He claims the account, written by Philips, makes him look bungling and inept. The publicity material for the book, Ice Trek, a journey to the South Pole, describes how the trio set out to complete the 3,000-kilometre journey from Ross Island to the South Pole and back, further than anyone had traversed Antarctica. \"This is Eric Philips's account of a very public journey and a very public falling out on the ice,\" say publishers HarperCollins. \"The journey across Antarctica was conducted in a blaze of publicity which included regular phone calls live to a television show and an internet site through which the public could follow the team's progress. \"The venture was hampered by appalling weather, which kept the men tent-bound for longer than they had anticipated. Soon illness stalked the team. Despite this they reached the pole but never completed the return journey. On their return, the tensions between the team members erupted in a very public falling out, mainly between Eric and Peter.\" The expedition, called Ice Trek, was sponsored by the now bankrupt satellite phone company Iridium. It ended when the trio reached the South Pole in January 26 last year. Already delayed by illness and bad weather, they were airlifted back to McMurdo Sound instead of walking as planned. Disagreements between the camp were made public on their return when Philips criticised Hillary and Muir, saying they lacked the necessary skills to fly special kites that were to have towed their sleds for much of the journey. Hillary said he had read an advance copy of Philips's book and described it as a \"jaundiced and self-centred\" personal account devoted to \"revealing Hillary\". \"We didn't get on. It was a lonely expedition,\" Hillary said, adding: \"It [the book] is an assault on me. It is certainly a slap in the face, there's no doubt about it.\" Hillary added that he wanted an official account of the trip to be published, not a \"weirdly obsessive book\" such as that written by Philips. He claims it breaches a contract between the trio not to publish anything within three years of the expedition ending. \"Personal accounts of the expedition were not to be published until three years after the end of the expedition. Obviously Eric has gone ahead and done this and I don't think he is standing by his word.\" Hillary said he was writing his own book but would wait until the agreed three-year term was up before publishing it. But author Philips and fellow explorer Muir say they have no idea why Hillary is claiming the book breaks a legal agreement signed by the three adventurers. Backing Philips, Muir added that it was clear to him and should be to Hillary that the book did not break the contract at all. Speaking from Australia, he added that the contract made it quite clear a book would be written. He had even provided journal extracts to Philips to help him write the book but was not due to share in any of the author's profits. Asked if the book was an unflattering account of Hillary, Muir said it showed the strengths and weaknesses of the team. Philips said that while Hillary might not like the way he was portrayed in parts of the book, at issue was that Philips had described it as an official record of the expedition. A HarperCollins spokeswoman said she could not say what the legal wrangle over Philips's book involved, but added: \"We are confident it will be resolved.\"",

      "bodyText": "British motorists must pay VAT on road toll charges, the European Court of Justice ruled today. The Luxembourg judges backed a European Commission case that such charges are subject to VAT - a share of which is passed to Brussels as a major contribution to the EU budget. The extra cost will now apply to all bridge and tunnel tolls in the UK to comply with EU VAT laws. Under a 23-year old EU rule, VAT must be levied on \"taxable persons\" - but the rules say public authorities are not considered to be \"taxable persons\" and governments need not impose VAT on services provided by public authorities. The Government says only three UK toll crossings - the Dartford Crossing, the Severn Bridge and the Skye Bridge - are operated by private businesses. The Erskine Bridge over the River Clyde is owned by the Secretary of State for Scotland and operated by him in his role as the \"roads authority\". The Tyne and Mersey Tunnels, the Tay, Tamar, Humber, Cleddau, Forth Road and Clifton Suspension Bridges are all owned and operated by public authorities. But the Commission argues the \"taxable persons\" being targeted are the paying motorists and not the toll operators. Not only private motorists will be hit - the Treasury also faces a hefty back-payment running into millions of pounds because a share of all national VAT receipts must be passed to Brussels to help finance the European budget. Brussels can seek retrospective payments as far back as 1994. Liberal Democrat MEP Chris Davies said motorists using the Mersey Tunnels as well as major crossings such as the Humber and Severn bridges would be hardest hit. The cost of using the Hawkshead ferry across Windermere in the Lake District could also be affected. Mr Davies, a member of the European Parliament's transport committee, said the Government could opt to abolish tolls for estuary crossings.",

      "body": "<p>It is 2.45pm on a hot Monday afternoon and the mood on the first floor of London's Dorchester Hotel is getting ugly. Jennifer Lopez, actress, singer, girlfriend of rap star Puff Daddy, is somewhere not far away, deep within the marshmallow furnishings of her hotel suite while an assembly of journalists waits to interview her. There have been some last minute \"adjustments\" to the schedule and the question on everybody's mind is, how long will we get with her and who do we have to kill to get longer? </p> <p>The time allowance for these sorts of interviews, when an actor holds court in a hotel room and parcels out dreary half-hour slots to plug her latest movie, are negotiated down to the last minute. But even by the absurd standards of the Hollywood PR machine, there is an air of surrealism to the afternoon's itinerary. According to the publicist's schedule, I am down to hobnob with Lopez for a quarter of an hour, between the minutes of 2.46 and 3.01. And I am one of the lucky ones. </p> <p>The holding room into which the journalists are herded is provided with refreshments and a television tuned to Sky news. It is hot and the mood is fractious. Two radio journalists have just been told that their time with Lopez has been axed from 13 minutes to 11 and they speculate on how much of that they will have to give over to talking about her new film. Called The Cell, it is a truly appalling sci-fi flick directed by Tarsem, winner of the 1991 MTV best video award for his direction of the video for REM's Losing My Religion. The Cell, his debut film - featuring Vince Vaughn and an uncomfortable looking Marianne Jean-Baptiste - is like one long music video with a serial killer subplot. \"We'll lose at least five minutes while she goes on about that,\" says the radio journalist, rolling his eyes. </p> <p>Meanwhile, on the mustard-coloured sofa across the room, the television contingent are checking their watches and trying to salvage some kind of continuity from a mini-script Lopez has agreed to read from and which they have had to slash at the last minute. They have just been told they have 10 minutes with her. \"Long enough to show us what a great acting talent she is,\" says one, oozing sarcasm. </p> <p>Into this unhappy atmosphere comes a publicist, manfully holding up a clipboard and trying to inject some kind of professionalism into the mounting farce, by talking in sharp, I-mean-business tones. \"Independent on Sunday?\" he raps, and after waiting for a second follows it up with, \"No? OK, Guardian? Guardian? Come with me.\" It is quite possible that the reporter from the Independent on Sunday has gone to the loo and not only missed his cue, but missed the entire span of his interview. \"Wait in here,\" says an American PR. \"You've got five minutes.\" So, here are my five minutes with Jennifer Lopez. </p> <p>Lopez, a 31-year-old American of Puerto Rican parentage, backs into the room, sharing a joke with an unseen flunky on the other side of the door. She laughs all the way to the sofa and turns round at the last minute, gliding into place and fixing me with a bright smile. \"Hi.\" She is pretty, with gold eyeshadow and perfect teeth. I have five questions for her and am confident of extracting the maximum amount of cliches in the time allowed. Luckily, she talks quickly. </p> <p>Minute one: What was it about the script of The Cell that appealed to you? </p> <p>\"It was kinda like Silence of the Lambs, which I had read years before. It just seemed like it had a lot of room for creative licence, you know what I mean? I mean, with the right director I thought it could be something really special, which is what it turned out to be. It's just a great, scary movie. I think what art is about is the expression of different opinions and different things and different artists are inspired by different things and sometimes that's not positive, it's negative.\" </p> <p>Minute two: Did you do any research for your role as Catherine Deane, a psychologist who through the medium of \"transcendental science\" experiences what is going on in other people's psyches? </p> <p>\"I do research for all my roles. Yeees. For this one, since I was playing a therapist, I went kinda undercover to see a therapist, you know, used a different name and kinda just wanted to see how a female therapist interacted with a patient. I wasn't recognised. I don't think she knew who I was.\" </p> <p>Minute three: To what extent did you empathise with the character you were playing? </p> <p>\"Um, a lot. I mean, she's very passionate, and very driven to help these people in her job, you know what I mean? But what was interesting to me, was the fact that it was almost to her own detriment, so that she was sacrificing herself. Like a sacrificial lamb in a way, especially when it came to going into the killer's mind not once or twice, but three times.\" </p> <p>(At this stage the publicist quietly opens the door and holds up two fingers to indicate that I have two minutes left). </p> <p>Minute four: What do you think is your greatest achievement as an actress so far? </p> <p>(Big sigh) \"I don't know. Maybe a movie I just did called Angel Eyes. I'm not sure, I'll have to see it first. I'm so focused when I'm working, you know what I mean, I don't go outside of my head and think, 'I'm really achieving now.' I kinda really just try to stay focused on what I'm doing that day and who I am and stuff like that. I think when you start examining yourself like that you get into a little bit of trouble.\" </p> <p>Minute five: Can you give me five words to describe yourself? </p> <p>\"Loving, strong, passionate, sensitive. [Long pause.] Um, caring.\" </p> <p>And five words to describe Puffy? </p> <p>\"Yeah, I could. I would say he is powerful, charismatic, caring, dynamic. [Long pause.] Sweet.\" </p> <p>This time there is a proper knock at the door and the publicist enters, head cocked to one side in an \"Isn't this just crazy?\" apologetic pose. I wish Lopez good luck for the premiere tonight. \"Thanks,\" she says. \"Are you coming?\" I shake my head and walk down the corridor, where a set of gold-backed chairs has been lined up to accommodate the next five interviewers.</p>",

Called Farmers for Action, it was launched at a service station on the M5 near Birmingham earlier this year amid growing disenchantment over the reluctance of the National Farmers' Union and the Country Landowners' Association to confront ministers with tougher tactics in defence of the beleaguered industry. Another, looser alliance in north Wales was partly responsible for the more spontaneous protest which launched the nationwide action at Stanlow oil refinery in Cheshire five days ago. Away from the public gaze the FFA, which claims 5,500 supporters, has been organising pickets of supermarket distribution depots and dairies for much of the year in protest at the falling price of milk - down 50% in three years - which is forcing more farmers towards bankruptcy. \"We don't have a designated leader because that's the best way to operate,\" said Tom Houghton, one of the militant 12, who rears cattle and sheep on 130 acres in Cheshire, and helped organise the picket which triggered at Stanlow. \"We started in a small way, but now this has snowballed to an extent where you don't know what will happen next.

      "byline": "Charlotte Denny",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<b> Why are British motorists paying more in petrol taxes than drivers anywhere else in Europe?</b> <p> When Norman Lamont was Chancellor he introduced the practice of increasing duties on petrol faster than inflation. The justification for the so-called fuel \"escalator\" was environmental: the government wants to discourage us from using cars and adding to global warming. </p> <p> <b> Do higher petrol costs deter people from driving?</b> </p> <p> The number of miles driven in Britain has risen by 12% since the start of the decade. However, the government believes that had fuel duties not risen so fast people would have driven even more miles. That is why Gordon Brown increased the fuel escalator from 5% over inflation to 6% when Labour came to power. Green considerations aside, it has also been a handy source of funds for Treasury. </p> <p> <b> What happened to the fuel escalator?</b> </p> <p> Mr Brown scrapped it in November last year, and promised future above-inflation increases in fuel duties would be spent on measures to improve public transport and the road network. </p> <p> <b> How much is the tax worth to the government?</b> </p> <p> The Treasury takes 71p in every pound spent on petrol. Last year, motorists contributed \u00a336bn to the government's coffers. </p> <p> <b> Is blockading refineries legal?</b> </p> <p> No, but if the French experience is anything to go by it's a lot more effective at grabbing political attention than the dump the pump campaign's rather feeble attempts to persuade people to stop filling up their cars. In France, fishermen and farmers wrung promises out of government ministers to cut fuel duties after they brought cross channel traffic to a standstill. </p> <p> <b> Could the organisers face legal action?</b> </p> <p> It is not an industrial dispute, so the organisers are not protected by legal exemptions which cover industrial pickets. In theory they could be sued by the oil companies for loss of revenue or moved on by the police for blocking a public highway. </p> <p> <b> What powers do police have to break blockades?</b> </p> <p> Individual chief constables have the responsibility for deciding what action will be taken in response to local circumstances. Powers under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1994 could be used to arrest individuals causing harm to people or property or unlawfully obstructing the highway. Common law powers allow police to make arrests to prevent a breach of the peace.

      "bodyText": "Why are British motorists paying more in petrol taxes than drivers anywhere else in Europe? When Norman Lamont was Chancellor he introduced the practice of increasing duties on petrol faster than inflation. The justification for the so-called fuel \"escalator\" was environmental: the government wants to discourage us from using cars and adding to global warming. Do higher petrol costs deter people from driving? The number of miles driven in Britain has risen by 12% since the start of the decade. However, the government believes that had fuel duties not risen so fast people would have driven even more miles. That is why Gordon Brown increased the fuel escalator from 5% over inflation to 6% when Labour came to power. Green considerations aside, it has also been a handy source of funds for Treasury. What happened to the fuel escalator? Mr Brown scrapped it in November last year, and promised future above-inflation increases in fuel duties would be spent on measures to improve public transport and the road network. How much is the tax worth to the government? The Treasury takes 71p in every pound spent on petrol. Last year, motorists contributed \u00a336bn to the government's coffers. Is blockading refineries legal? No, but if the French experience is anything to go by it's a lot more effective at grabbing political attention than the dump the pump campaign's rather feeble attempts to persuade people to stop filling up their cars. In France, fishermen and farmers wrung promises out of government ministers to cut fuel duties after they brought cross channel traffic to a standstill. Could the organisers face legal action? It is not an industrial dispute, so the organisers are not protected by legal exemptions which cover industrial pickets. In theory they could be sued by the oil companies for loss of revenue or moved on by the police for blocking a public highway. What powers do police have to break blockades? Individual chief constables have the responsibility for deciding what action will be taken in response to local circumstances. Powers under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1994 could be used to arrest individuals causing harm to people or property or unlawfully obstructing the highway. Common law powers allow police to make arrests to prevent a breach of the peace. Under the Public Order Act 1986 they have the power to arrest individual protesters for threatening or abusive behaviour or harassment. Could the Chancellor cut petrol taxes? Excise duty and VAT on fuel could theoretically be decreased by statutory order, without the need for primary legislation. This mechanism is used each year on Budget day to ensure that changes in taxation on consumer goods come into effect at midnight that day. Normally Parliament has to be sitting for a statutory order to come into effect, but it is possible for the Government to seek the agreement of the lord chancellor and the speaker for it to be put into immediate effect in the absence of MPs during recess. Can he afford to do it? Cutting fuel taxes by 2p a litre would cost the treasury about \u00a31bn which ministers say would have to be found elsewhere, either in spending cuts or tax hikes. However, there will be more money in the Chancellor's coffers than he initially expected this year, and rising oil prices is one of reasons.

The city bypass was badly congested for several hours. </p> <p>A spokesman for the drivers, Mark Williams, said: \"The key argument is to get the fuel prices back down in line with other European countries. Just now it is massively out of order. We can't accept the crippling fuel prices any longer.\" </p> <p>However, the Scotland Office minister Brian Wilson condemned the protest. \"Stopping other people getting to work and forcing old ladies to stand at bus stops, leave children waiting for buses in the rain - I don't think there's anything to be gained from any of that and I don't really think it is a very good idea,\" he said. </p> <p>Phil Flanders, of the Road Haulage Association in Scotland, said he was disappointed at the unofficial action, and concerned that it might alienate the public ahead of today's larger protest. </p> <p>But he said there could be no let up in the pressure for fairer prices. \"We're not wasting our time. If we just sit back and accept it then hauliers and farmers will go out of business.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile, petrol stations across Dumfries and Galloway reported panic buying by motorists, with some expecting their pumps to run dry by the end of the day. </p> <p>Police were also on alert in Grangemouth for possible disruption at the main petro-chemical complex there. </p> <p> Kirsty Scott </p> <p><b> North-east</b><br> </p> <p> Five men and three lorries threw most of north-eastern England into chaos yesterday, helped by a region-wide outbreak of panic petrol buying. </p> <p>The group reversed their trucks into the entrance of the Conoco and Total refineries at Immingham on the Humber, throttling the supply of fuel to garages from Nottingham to the North Yorkshire border. </p> <p>Similar pickets on Tyneside completed the job for Tyne and Wear and Northumbria, where police held an emergency meeting to keep patrol cars on the road. Police drivers in Cleveland and North Yorkshire were also ordered to limit patrols to safeguard fuel supplies. </p> <p>Officers were called to a garage in Derby where prices were hiked to \u00a32 a litre as scores of drivers from the petrol-starved north-west drove there to find supplies. </p> <p>No action was taken, however, against 80 trucks which reduced the motorway system in Yorkshire to chaos by driving three abreast at under 25mph around the junction of the M1 and M62 motorways. </p> <p>Public support for the blockades was widespread in spite of the misery involved. Peter Turner, the managing director of Rix Petroleum in Hull whose depot was also sealed off, said: \"We're the wrong target but we sympathise with the all the farmers and hauliers, some of whom are our customers and friends.\" </p> <p>At the Hull garage 200 metres from the home of the deputy prime minister, John Prescott - who was celebrating 30 years of being MP for East Hull last night - the \"no fuel\" signs went up at 2pm. </p> <p> Martin Wainwright </p> <p><b> North-west and north Wales</b><br> </p> <p> The north-west of England was running out of petrol last night as blockades of refineries and terminals spread. </p> <p>Filling stations across a swath of country from the Welsh border to the Pennines locked their pumps as tanks ran dry.

Some drivers complained of steep price rises. </p> <p>Traffic on the M6 slowed as drivers joined queues for fuel at Charnock Richard services in Lancashire. </p> <p>More than 150 Liverpool taxi drivers supported pickets at the Stanlow oil refinery in Cheshire, where the blockades began last Thursday. Taxi drivers also caused gridlock in Liverpool last night by driving their cabs at a snail's pace through the city centre. </p> <p>Brynle Williams, leader of the Stanlow protesters, threatened to blockade the port of Holyhead if refinery managers continued to supply fuel to Seacat ferries. </p> <p>\"We don't like the idea of Irish drivers coming over here with their cheap diesel then working two or three days and bringing over their cheap meat, robbing us of a living,\" he said, adding that Irish drivers filled their tanks with fuel bought in Ireland at half British prices. </p> <p>In Trafford Park, Manchester, 30 hauliers, including reinforcements from Shropshire, continued to prevent fuel leaving the giant terminal which supplies Esso, Texaco and Elf outlets in the region. </p> <p>Last night the North West Wales NHS Trust cancelled all non-emergency operations due to the crisis.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The crisis over petrol prices in Britain and elsewhere is almost entirely due to the myopia of governments and markets over the past 18 months in failing to recognise the emergence of a new star in the global political firmament. The youthful Hugo Chavez, aged 46, elected president of Venezuela in December 1998, is the principal figure behind the price rise. Last year he singlehandedly revived the moribund organisation of petroleum exporting countries, Opec, by calling for and securing a cut in oil production, and this year he has singlemindedly persuaded its members to stand firm in defence of a reasonable price.</p> <p>He recently toured all the Opec countries and sought agreement on an optimum price of $25 a barrel. He will host a great jamboree of Opec presidents in Caracas at the end of the month, only the second such event ever held.</p> <p>This man means business. The west has had plenty of warning of what he has been up to, and where he is coming from, but blinded by the arrogance of globalisation it has taken no steps to prepare anyone for the dramatic developments of recent days.</p> <p>Although Opec has usually appeared to western eyes as an organisation dominated by Arabs, it was actually conceived and founded by Venezuela in the heyday of what used to be called the Third World. The countries of Opec, for Venezuelans, constitute a large extended family. In the 1990s, when Venezuela was ruled by unpopular governments that signed up to the dominant strand of neo-liberalism that spread like a plague across the whole of South America, Opec was abandoned and ignored. Venezuela was one of the great cheaters of the organisation, ignoring the quotas set, and bringing in foreign companies to help increase production through the development of new fields. When the world oil price dropped below $10 a barrel, the west fondly imagined that the exporting countries - many of them perceived as \"rogue states\", like Iran, Iraq and Libya - were permanently defeated and that this low price would be the established pattern of the future.</p> <p>Colonel Chavez - for he was originally a military officer - had other ideas. Petroleos de Venezuela, the state oil company nationalised in 1975, is the country's chief source of wealth. Chavez needed a steady and larger flow of income from the oil wells to finance his ambitious plans to transform the country and to satisfy his voters in the poorest section of society. He was well aware that his radical rhetoric, avowedly hostile to what he describes as \"savage neo-liberalism\" imposed on Latin America by the US, would do him no favours with nervous foreign investors. He decided to play the oil card.</p> <p>At an Opec meeting in March 1999, his oil minister, Ali Rodriguez Araque, was instructed to announce that Venezuela would in future respect the cutbacks in production already agreed, and would support a further cutback of 4%. It was \"a change of 180 degrees\" in the policy of previous governments, Chavez proudly announced. Ali Rodriguez is now Opec's president, and the oil price has risen from $10 to over $30 a barrel.</p> <p>Although the Latin American military are usually remembered for the rightwing dictators that they spawn, Chavez belongs to another tradition, that of radical junior officers, in touch with the raw conscripts from the peasantry, whose revolutionary politics are fuelled by anger at the degenerate state of the nation. Chavez is also an heir to a civilian tradition of rebellion in Latin America, that of the leftwing guerrillas of the 1960s inspired by Fidel Castro and Che Guevara. Some of his advisers were once associated with a Chinese-oriented split from the Venezuelan Communist Party who went on to make lasting contacts with radicals in the Arab world in the 1970s. Ali Rodriguez himself was a guerrilla in the 1960s, before becoming a labour lawyer and an oil expert for one of the smaller radical parties. One member of that generation, Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, \"Carlos the Jackal\", famous among other things for an armed attack on Opec headquarters in Vienna in December 1975, now languishes in a French jail.</p> <p>Chavez is a good friend of Fidel Castro and a frequent visitor to Cuba, and his ambitions are as grandiose as those of the Cuban leader. He hopes that his reconstruction of Opec will help him to forge a new \"Bolivarian\" alliance in Latin America that will fulfil the dreams of Simon Bolivar, the South American liberator of the 19th century, who sought continental unity against the outside world.</p> <p>Yet Chavez is no populist demagogue. He seeks a fair price for Opec oil, not an exorbitant one. This would mean price stabilisation, as Opec has reiterated throughout the summer, in a band between $22 and $28 a barrel. This week's Opec decision to increase production by 3%, might just allow that to happen eventually, but no amount of \"pressure\" from Tony Blair or Bill Clinton on individual countries is likely to break the fresh sense of purpose that Chavez has infused into the organisation.</p> <p>\u0095 In the Shadow of the Liberator: Hugo Chavez and the Transformation of Venezuela by Richard Gott is published by Verso</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:Rwgott@aol.com\">Rwgott@aol.com</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "The crisis over petrol prices in Britain and elsewhere is almost entirely due to the myopia of governments and markets over the past 18 months in failing to recognise the emergence of a new star in the global political firmament. The youthful Hugo Chavez, aged 46, elected president of Venezuela in December 1998, is the principal figure behind the price rise. Last year he singlehandedly revived the moribund organisation of petroleum exporting countries, Opec, by calling for and securing a cut in oil production, and this year he has singlemindedly persuaded its members to stand firm in defence of a reasonable price. He recently toured all the Opec countries and sought agreement on an optimum price of $25 a barrel. He will host a great jamboree of Opec presidents in Caracas at the end of the month, only the second such event ever held. This man means business. The west has had plenty of warning of what he has been up to, and where he is coming from, but blinded by the arrogance of globalisation it has taken no steps to prepare anyone for the dramatic developments of recent days. Although Opec has usually appeared to western eyes as an organisation dominated by Arabs, it was actually conceived and founded by Venezuela in the heyday of what used to be called the Third World. The countries of Opec, for Venezuelans, constitute a large extended family. In the 1990s, when Venezuela was ruled by unpopular governments that signed up to the dominant strand of neo-liberalism that spread like a plague across the whole of South America, Opec was abandoned and ignored. Venezuela was one of the great cheaters of the organisation, ignoring the quotas set, and bringing in foreign companies to help increase production through the development of new fields. When the world oil price dropped below $10 a barrel, the west fondly imagined that the exporting countries - many of them perceived as \"rogue states\", like Iran, Iraq and Libya - were permanently defeated and that this low price would be the established pattern of the future. Colonel Chavez - for he was originally a military officer - had other ideas. Petroleos de Venezuela, the state oil company nationalised in 1975, is the country's chief source of wealth. Chavez needed a steady and larger flow of income from the oil wells to finance his ambitious plans to transform the country and to satisfy his voters in the poorest section of society. He was well aware that his radical rhetoric, avowedly hostile to what he describes as \"savage neo-liberalism\" imposed on Latin America by the US, would do him no favours with nervous foreign investors. He decided to play the oil card. At an Opec meeting in March 1999, his oil minister, Ali Rodriguez Araque, was instructed to announce that Venezuela would in future respect the cutbacks in production already agreed, and would support a further cutback of 4%. It was \"a change of 180 degrees\" in the policy of previous governments, Chavez proudly announced. Ali Rodriguez is now Opec's president, and the oil price has risen from $10 to over $30 a barrel. Although the Latin American military are usually remembered for the rightwing dictators that they spawn, Chavez belongs to another tradition, that of radical junior officers, in touch with the raw conscripts from the peasantry, whose revolutionary politics are fuelled by anger at the degenerate state of the nation. Chavez is also an heir to a civilian tradition of rebellion in Latin America, that of the leftwing guerrillas of the 1960s inspired by Fidel Castro and Che Guevara. Some of his advisers were once associated with a Chinese-oriented split from the Venezuelan Communist Party who went on to make lasting contacts with radicals in the Arab world in the 1970s. Ali Rodriguez himself was a guerrilla in the 1960s, before becoming a labour lawyer and an oil expert for one of the smaller radical parties. One member of that generation, Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, \"Carlos the Jackal\", famous among other things for an armed attack on Opec headquarters in Vienna in December 1975, now languishes in a French jail. Chavez is a good friend of Fidel Castro and a frequent visitor to Cuba, and his ambitions are as grandiose as those of the Cuban leader. He hopes that his reconstruction of Opec will help him to forge a new \"Bolivarian\" alliance in Latin America that will fulfil the dreams of Simon Bolivar, the South American liberator of the 19th century, who sought continental unity against the outside world. Yet Chavez is no populist demagogue. He seeks a fair price for Opec oil, not an exorbitant one. This would mean price stabilisation, as Opec has reiterated throughout the summer, in a band between $22 and $28 a barrel. This week's Opec decision to increase production by 3%, might just allow that to happen eventually, but no amount of \"pressure\" from Tony Blair or Bill Clinton on individual countries is likely to break the fresh sense of purpose that Chavez has infused into the organisation. \u0095 In the Shadow of the Liberator: Hugo Chavez and the Transformation of Venezuela by Richard Gott is published by Verso Rwgott@aol.com",

Of that, 22 percentage points were due to tax. A considerable part of Labour's public spending plans is - sorry - fuelled by pain at the pumps.</p> <p>Yes, a good part of the increase in the price of petrol over recent months has been due to increases in the price of oil - the realm of Opec - but the high level of petrol prices in the United Kingdom is largely due to the tax rate. To that extent the political protest that has been mounting over the past few days addresses the right target. What government takes, government can return.</p> <p>But petrol tax is scarcely a New Labour invention. The amount of tax (duty plus VAT) that is imposed on petrol has increased steeply in real terms since 1993, when the Tories first introduced the \"escalator\", pushing up duty beyond the general rise in prices on a regular basis. Together, VAT and duty now represent around 72% of the price on the forecourts. The UK has the highest tax rate on petrol in the European Union: cross the border from Northern Ireland into the Republic and the tax take falls dramatically.</p> <p>Labour can claim to have given motorists respite. In Gordon Brown's March budget, for the first time in several years, duty on petrol was not increased in real terms. Labour can also point out that in May 1997 the total tax on petrol represented 76% of the retail price - 4 percentage points higher than the figure today. This is not, however, down to any reduction in the level of tax imposed on fuel. It has happened because the retail price has increased proportionately more. Duty imposed on fuel is a fixed amount per unit, regardless of the price. So, when the price charged to motorists rises, duty falls as a proportion of the price at the pump.</p> <p>World oil prices have been rising - and that has had fiscal consequences, too. Government revenue from oil has been rising. As well as fuel duty, VAT is imposed on petrol. It is a percentage of price so when the price rises, so does the flow to Customs and Excise. The recent increase in the price of petrol could mean an extra \u00a30.5bn for the Treasury. This fact has led some commentators to say Gordon Brown should share his largesse with motorists and use these proceeds to cut duty on petrol. It is not a convincing argument. Oil prices fluctuate and there may be an unexpected fall in the price of petrol in the future leading to unexpected losses in government revenue with - as Stephen Byers reiterated yesterday - consequences for spending on services.</p> <p>The big question has to be: why is petrol taxation in the UK so much higher than elsewhere? It could be the result of environmental enlightenment. The automatic increases in duty above inflation that began in 1993 were imposed - in the heyday of John Gummer - as part of an attempt to change people's behaviour and get them out of their cars. Has the tactic worked? The general question is about the elasticity of demand for petrol - in other words, do people reduce their use of the car in the face of higher prices?</p> <p>The evidence says very little. When the price of fuel goes up, people do not respond by cutting the amount of fuel they buy or by using alternative methods of transport, at least in the shortrun. Even if they did respond to price increases, the fact that some aspects of pollution from road transport (like congestion or soot) are only loosely linked to the level of fuel used, means that the policy is not very well targeted to protect the environment.</p> <p>So (as an after-the-event rationalisation) using increases in petrol duty to protect the environment is hard to justify. That is both because of the lack of response by consumers to changes in price and because the cost of fuel is not always very closely related to the environmental cost involved. This is not to say that the high rate of duty has not had any effect on the behaviour of motorists. For example, people may have switched to buying more fuel-efficient cars, which helps to reduce the harmful effect on the environment. It is unclear how far British behaviour is noticeably different from those countries (Spain, Belgium) where fuel tax is considerably less.</p> <p>Chancellors and environment secretaries are usually going to disagree. It is the very lack of response by motorists to increases in the price of petrol that makes it such an attractive source of revenue. If people do not cut back the amount of fuel they buy after a tax increase, large amounts of money can be easily (painlessly is another matter) raised. Petrol duty raises around \u00a322.3bn a year - around 6% of total government revenues. A 1p cut in fuel duty would cost the government some \u00a3420m. Add the VAT and we are talking about a sizeable portion of public revenues.</p> <p>Fuel taxes fall more heavily on some people than others - but beware exaggerated claims by people living in rural areas. If we look at the effect of a 6% hike in petrol duty across households from different income groups, it is middle-income households that are the most adversely affected by the increase. This is because a large proportion of the poorest households do not own a car and so the increase in the tax has no effect on them. But the picture changes if we look at all car-owning households. Here a fuel duty rise has a disproportionate effect on the poorest households among them.</p> <p>The concern about the effect on those living in rural areas is less well founded. There is a slightly bigger effect on households living in rural areas but the difference is small.</p> <p>\u0095 Zo\u00eb Smith is at the Institute for Fiscal Studies <br>zoe_s@<a href=\"http://www.ifs.org.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.ifs.org.uk</a></p>",

For example, people may have switched to buying more fuel-efficient cars, which helps to reduce the harmful effect on the environment. It is unclear how far British behaviour is noticeably different from those countries (Spain, Belgium) where fuel tax is considerably less. Chancellors and environment secretaries are usually going to disagree. It is the very lack of response by motorists to increases in the price of petrol that makes it such an attractive source of revenue. If people do not cut back the amount of fuel they buy after a tax increase, large amounts of money can be easily (painlessly is another matter) raised. Petrol duty raises around \u00a322.3bn a year - around 6% of total government revenues. A 1p cut in fuel duty would cost the government some \u00a3420m. Add the VAT and we are talking about a sizeable portion of public revenues. Fuel taxes fall more heavily on some people than others - but beware exaggerated claims by people living in rural areas. If we look at the effect of a 6% hike in petrol duty across households from different income groups, it is middle-income households that are the most adversely affected by the increase. This is because a large proportion of the poorest households do not own a car and so the increase in the tax has no effect on them. But the picture changes if we look at all car-owning households. Here a fuel duty rise has a disproportionate effect on the poorest households among them. The concern about the effect on those living in rural areas is less well founded. There is a slightly bigger effect on households living in rural areas but the difference is small. \u0095 Zo\u00eb Smith is at the Institute for Fiscal Studies zoe_s@www.ifs.org.uk",

      "bodyText": "The gut belief of many Americans that gun ownership has been central to their way of life since colonial days is a 20th century invention, says a book published in the US this week. There are currently estimated to be more than 250m firearms in private hands and every year 5m new guns are being bought - overwhelmingly by white men aged between 25 and 34. More than 16,000 people are shot dead each year on average. Those who oppose the introduction of tough laws restricting firearms argue that widespread access to such weapons is part of America's gun-toting militia history before, during and after the independence revolution that began in 1775. Not so, says Michael Bellesiles of Emory university in Atlanta, Georgia, in a book which, according to a New York Times review this week, \"deflates the myth of the self-reliant and self-armed virtuous yeoman of the revolutionary militias\". Professor Bellesiles says that the fact that the modern US contains more gunshops than schools \"would have shocked the toughest resident of the early American frontier\". The National Rifle Association and other pro-gun lobbies often evoke a picture of the 18th-century pioneer armed and ready to kill for his supper, armed to defend his property against marauders and standing shoulder to shoulder with his equally armed neighbours against oppressive government - British or American - in defence of a free way of life. Prof Bellesiles says this image is almost wholly false. Most Americans in the time of George Washington and the \"founding fathers\" who signed the declaration of independence in 1776 were growers and traders, not hunters, he said. His book, Arming America: the Origins of a National Gun Culture, says that only some 14% of households in northern New England and Pennsylvania had firearms in the years 1765 to 1790 - years typically thought of as the heyday of gun ownership and use.

      "bodyText": "A Chechen local government official was shot dead in a rebel ambush on Sunday, the latest victim of an assassination campaign against Chechens who work for the pro-Moscow government. Bukara Akhmatov was head of the administration in the village of Oktyabrskoye, the government said. Meanwhile Interfax reported that Russian troops had found and defused a bomb on Sunday near the house of Akhmad Kadyrov, head of the government, who has survived several assassination attempts this year. Russian soldiers killed two rebels who tried to flee after planting a mine near the village of Prigorodny, Itar-Tass reported. Yesterday Russian jets and helicopters continued to bomb forested areas in the south of the country. Rebels attacked Russian positions 15 times in 24 hours, mostly with grenades and small arms, officials said. There was sporadic gunfire in the capital, Grozny. The Russian military claims that rebel resistance has been all but crushed after a year of fighting, but the rebels show no sign of giving up their struggle for independence and mount almost daily attacks on the federal forces.

He pointed out that the same customers sometimes wanted beds and cameras: many of the department stores that sell the company's beds also need to be supplied with advanced security devices. Mr Topping said: \"We are a hybrid - we've got quite separate constituent features.\" Photo-Scan is to be floated on the Alternative Investment Market, with a likely value of \u00a330m-\u00a350m. This is likely to dwarf the rest of Relyon, which is expected to be worth \u00a325m-\u00a330m. The group announced a 27% rise in half-year profits to \u00a33.1m. Its shares rose 14p to 242.5p.",

Officials at the department insist the investigation has cost just \u00a3150,000 to pursue which at the very least indicates that the DTI needs to review its internal accounting procedures, because the numbers do not add up. And it is not clear why the Clegg case has been published now. Maybe they are having a clear-out before the DTI inspection department is closed down. Maybe we can even look forward to the real Archer story.",

The chancellor will also deliver an uncompromising message on pay, insisting that unions, who are campaigning for government action to rein in boardroom greed, must avoid \"inflation-busting pay rises\" and exercise \"wage restraint and responsibility\". Mr Brown will address a trade union movement gathering which is demanding a \u00a35 minimum wage and an end to the creeping privatisation of public services through the private finance initiative championed by the chancellor. But, although Mr Brown is expert at playing labour movement audiences and is expected to seek to pacify union anger over pensions, Treasury sources said his main focus would be on the need to close the productivity gap with Britain's competitors. The country's new found economic stability has created an opportunity, he plans to warn, which \"we can squander in a return to stop-go and short-termism or we can seize with the disciplined changes to build higher productivity and full employment\". With a productivity gap of up to 30% between British companies and their counterparts in Germany, the US and elsewhere, Mr Brown is expected to say, there needs to be a \"national drive\" to achieve a faster rise in output per worker than Britain's competitors. In a passage which is likely to be well received by TUC delegates, the Chancellor intends to add: \"The prize for all of us is great - not just full employment for a year or two, but full employment sustained for a generation.\" Mr Brown nevertheless faces strong criticism from unions, in particular over his encouragement of the use of private companies to run public services through PFI and local authority \"best value\" schemes. The TUC's largest affiliate, the public services union Unison, yesterday published the results of a Mori opinion poll showing that more than two-thirds of those questioned believed public services should be run by the government or by local authorities, rather than by private companies. The Unison leader, Rodney Bickerstaffe, said the government needed to understand that \"creeping privatisation\" and the \"privatisation culture prevalent throughout Britain\" were unpopular with the public. \"People do not want public services run for profit, they want well-funded, democratically accountable public services provided by directly employed public workers,\" he said. The chancellor is strongly committed to the increasing use of private finance and private companies in the public sector - partly as a way of keeping down the public sector borrowing requirement - and is unlikely to offer any significant concessions in that area. He has, however, been discussing possible compromises over the growing clamour in the trade unions and Labour party for the restoration of earnings-linked increases in the state pension, broken by the Thatcher government. Asked what he expected to be the TUC's reaction to Mr Brown's call for pay restraint at a time when executive salaries are rising far faster than employees' wages, a spokesman for the Chancellor said it was a message he had also delivered to the CBI's conference.",

His call came as the TUC's annual congress demanded fresh legislation to boost workers' rights, including measures to protect staff from unpaid overtime worth at least \u00a323bn to employers each year. A TUC survey estimated that at least 4m employees regularly work more than five hours extra unpaid a week, with half of these working on days off, and 12m saying work stress makes them irritable and bad tempered at home. Unions told employers to stop complaining about the multimillion pound cost of employment protection, sums dwarfed by the value of unpaid overtime. Delegates overwhelmingly backed a motion demanding a new raft of measures to extend union rights at work, including paid parental leave. The TUC called for an end of the opting out of the EU's working time directive limiting the working week to 48 hours. It said one in eight employees - more than 3m - was still working more than 48 hours and the directive has failed to reduce the hours of 75% of workers on very long hours to below 48. A report by the National Association of Citizens' Advice Bureaux found that many employers are also avoiding giving the full weeks of paid holiday to which workers were entitled under the directive. The TUC said official figures suggesting unpaid overtime is worth \u00a323bn to employers were an underestimate, with managers contributing more than \u00a35,000 free each year, professionals over \u00a37,000 and even the lowest paid upwards of \u00a31,000.

      "body": "<p>Tony Blair should appoint a minister for manufacturing to promote investment and jobs and break the Treasury stranglehold on industrial policy, Sir Ken Jackson, leader of the AEEU engineering union, will urge later today.</p> <p>The prime minister's favourite union leader is due to launch a sustained onslaught on the damage that Treasury orthodoxy is allegedly wreaking on Britain's manufacturing base in the presence of the chancellor, Gordon Brown, at the TUC annual congress in Glasgow. Angered by what he sees as Mr Brown's dilatory approach to Britain joining the single currency, Sir Ken will accuse the chancellor of overseeing the loss of 250,000 manufacturing jobs and promoting e-commerce at the expense of industry.</p> <p>He was at the centre of a fresh inter-union row over the euro last night after Bill Morris, the TGWU leader and a close associate of the chancellor, accused him of being a \"puppet\" of multinational companies. The row erupted after Sir Ken released the names of seven, mainly foreign, investors employing 22,600 people who urged the UK to join the euro to safeguard trade and inward investment.</p> <p>It came 24 hours after the two unions supposedly sank their differences over the single currency and backed a comprise motion leaving open the question of when British entry should take place.</p> <p>But, if Mr Brown can take heart from these divisions, he will be angered by Sir Ken's call to make the Department of Trade and Industry the equal of the Treasury in shaping economic policy.</p> <p>The AEEU leader wants Mr Blair to transform the DTI into a French-style ministry by appointing a minister for manufacturing and setting up a cabinet committee.</p> <p>\"We already have a minister for e-commerce, one for small business and even one for the dome so why not one for manufacturing,\" his friends said. \"We have to break the stranglehold exercised by Treasury orthodoxy.\"</p> <p>Sir Ken's speech will reignite the tensions between the Treasury and DTI which came to a head when Peter Mandelson was briefly industry secretary and was supposed to be laid to rest when Stephen Byers, who served under Mr Brown, replaced him.</p> <p>The AEEU leader is worried that manufacturing's share of national output is set to fall below 20% - it was 23% when Labour came to power - and wants the cabinet to make it a bigger political priority. He claims Mr Blair's backing for his stance.</p> <p>Sir Ken is a fervent supporter of early UK entry to the euro, alleging that 1m manufacturing jobs are at risk, but agreed on Sunday to remove any reference to this from a congress motion both he and Mr Morris are backing.</p> <p>The AEEU said the Dutch firm Philips Electronics, Sony Manufacturing, the US-owned Perkins Engines, Germany's Robert Bosch and Delta Engineering have joined forces with the car maker Nissan and Dyson, manufacturer of the bagless vacuum cleaner, to back its pro-euro campaign.</p> <p>Sir Ken said the companies had never publicly spoken out in favour before. \"We can't ignore the fact that we risk this sort of investment if we don't enter. Gambling with this number of jobs is simply not an option.</p> <p>\"The government must be more positive and promote the benefits of joining. If it doesn't we'll lose jobs.

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair should appoint a minister for manufacturing to promote investment and jobs and break the Treasury stranglehold on industrial policy, Sir Ken Jackson, leader of the AEEU engineering union, will urge later today. The prime minister's favourite union leader is due to launch a sustained onslaught on the damage that Treasury orthodoxy is allegedly wreaking on Britain's manufacturing base in the presence of the chancellor, Gordon Brown, at the TUC annual congress in Glasgow. Angered by what he sees as Mr Brown's dilatory approach to Britain joining the single currency, Sir Ken will accuse the chancellor of overseeing the loss of 250,000 manufacturing jobs and promoting e-commerce at the expense of industry. He was at the centre of a fresh inter-union row over the euro last night after Bill Morris, the TGWU leader and a close associate of the chancellor, accused him of being a \"puppet\" of multinational companies. The row erupted after Sir Ken released the names of seven, mainly foreign, investors employing 22,600 people who urged the UK to join the euro to safeguard trade and inward investment. It came 24 hours after the two unions supposedly sank their differences over the single currency and backed a comprise motion leaving open the question of when British entry should take place. But, if Mr Brown can take heart from these divisions, he will be angered by Sir Ken's call to make the Department of Trade and Industry the equal of the Treasury in shaping economic policy. The AEEU leader wants Mr Blair to transform the DTI into a French-style ministry by appointing a minister for manufacturing and setting up a cabinet committee. \"We already have a minister for e-commerce, one for small business and even one for the dome so why not one for manufacturing,\" his friends said. \"We have to break the stranglehold exercised by Treasury orthodoxy.\" Sir Ken's speech will reignite the tensions between the Treasury and DTI which came to a head when Peter Mandelson was briefly industry secretary and was supposed to be laid to rest when Stephen Byers, who served under Mr Brown, replaced him. The AEEU leader is worried that manufacturing's share of national output is set to fall below 20% - it was 23% when Labour came to power - and wants the cabinet to make it a bigger political priority. He claims Mr Blair's backing for his stance. Sir Ken is a fervent supporter of early UK entry to the euro, alleging that 1m manufacturing jobs are at risk, but agreed on Sunday to remove any reference to this from a congress motion both he and Mr Morris are backing. The AEEU said the Dutch firm Philips Electronics, Sony Manufacturing, the US-owned Perkins Engines, Germany's Robert Bosch and Delta Engineering have joined forces with the car maker Nissan and Dyson, manufacturer of the bagless vacuum cleaner, to back its pro-euro campaign. Sir Ken said the companies had never publicly spoken out in favour before. \"We can't ignore the fact that we risk this sort of investment if we don't enter. Gambling with this number of jobs is simply not an option. \"The government must be more positive and promote the benefits of joining. If it doesn't we'll lose jobs. That would be disastrous for Britain.\" TUC conference docmentation: www.tuc.org.uk",

      "bodyText": "The senior police officer cleared of indecently assaulting two women last week still faces sexual harassment allegations from three other female colleagues, it emerged yesterday. Ian Beckett, the deputy chief constable of Surrey, will remain suspended until the force's police authority has had time to consider whether to launch disciplinary action. Although no details of the allegations from the three other women have been made public, the chief constable of Surrey, Denis O'Connor, said they were \"to some degree similar\" to those which were put to the jury at Southwark crown court in south-east London. During the five day trial, one of Mr Beckett's accusers, known as Miss Y, alleged he groped her breast and bottom. The second, Miss X, said Mr Beckett put his hand up her skirt and assaulted her for 10 seconds. She also claimed he made lewd remarks about her underwear. Mr Beckett was suspended in January, 1999, when Miss X, who cannot be named for legal reasons, alleged he had indecently assaulted her twice in December 1998. An independent investigation into Mr Beckett by Perry Nove, the commissioner of the City of London police, compiled evidence of sexual harassment from five women who worked at Surrey's headquarters near Guildford. In a report to the police authority Mr Nove recommended that Mr Beckett, 54, should face an internal disciplinary panel to explain his alleged behaviour towards all of the women. Mr Nove's report was also sent to the crown prosecution service, which charged Mr Beckett with indecently assaulting Miss X and Miss Y, both civilian workers. The authority deferred considering the matter further until the trial finished. Yesterday the authority's five-member senior personnel committee, chaired by Liz Campbell, issued a statement saying Mr Beckett would remain suspended. \"Mr Nove's report recommended disciplinary action be taken against Mr Beckett on allegations of sexual harassment in relation to five women,\" a statement said. \"The meeting has been adjourned until Thursday to give members time to consider the detailed report ... when it reconvenes the committee anticipates reaching a decision on whether to give notice to Mr Beckett that it considers disciplinary offences may have been committed.\" The statement added: \"The police authority recognises the process has been painful for many people ... however it is essential and in the interests of justice that the most careful consideration is given to all material information before further decisions are taken.\" Surrey police said yesterday that Miss X and Miss Y remained on staff and were being offered \"continued support\". Although the jury rejected their allegations, a force spokesman said there was no question of a further inquiry. Mr Beckett flatly rejected indecently assaulting Miss X and Miss Y. He dismissed their claims that he had subjected them to \"humiliating and degrading ordeals\", and said the stories were \"lies and fantasy\". Giving evidence, Mr Beckett said he had \"absolutely no idea\" why the women had accused him. He denied he had taken advantage of his position to carry out \"sexual assaults of increasing gravity\". He branded Miss X as a very unhappy woman who was incompetent and a liar. Mr Beckett said the allegations could be connected to the fact he had disciplined two of their friends after an incident over a pornographic email. Mr Beckett, who attempted suicide before the trial, was not available for comment last night. After his acquittal, he said he was looking forward to returning to work as a \"committed deputy chief constable\".",

      "bodyText": "European Union sanctions against Austria may be lifted as soon as today. Pierre Moscovici, the French minister for European affairs, said yesterday that the unprecedented but largely symbolic quarantine would end as soon as consultations with other member countries were completed. Britain said it was ready to lift the sanctions at once. Three \"wise men\" reported on Friday that Chancellor Wolfgang Sch\u00fcssel's conservative-led coalition met accepted European norms on the observation of human rights. Diplomats said the 14 other EU governments were likely to create a mechanism to monitor the future behaviour of the far-right Freedom party, whose part in the Austrian coalition provoked the EU's action in February. Another course might be to enhance the article of the Amsterdam treaty which requires member states to respect \"common European values\". Denmark, facing a crucial referendum on the euro on September 28, is pressing for a speedy resolution of the Austrian issue in the hope of easing the feeling of some of its citizens that the 14 have bullied Austria on an internal matter. President Jacques Chirac of France, a strong supporter of the sanctions, is expected to distance himself from the decision to lift them by suggesting that it should be discussed by EU foreign ministers at the UN summit in New York. France is the current holder of the EU presidency. The Freedom party's former but still de facto leader J\u00f6rg Haider greeted the imminent lifting of sanctions by making another controversial statement on immigration. He warned the EU against allowing cheap labour from eastern Europe to flood Austria. Speaking at the Zagreb autumn fair, he lived up to his reputation as a firebrand by expressing his concern that eastward expansion of the EU would cause waves of immigrants to swamp western Europe. But as the Austrian president, Thomas Klestil, appealed to Mr Chirac yesterday to allow an improvement in relations, Austrian opposition politicians urged the world to keep an eye on Mr Haider. Mr Haider told journalists: \"We agreed on a common basis to vote on the [EU] enlargement, but we have some conditions which have to be fulfilled.\" The international trade fair featured exhibitors from the province of Carinthia, where Mr Haider is governor. \"If we open our borders, we have concerns about our labour. Lots of cheap labour will enter the borders of Austria and this can endanger our labour force,\" he said. Mr Haider resigned as party leader in April in the hope that sanctions would be lifted. He said yesterday that he was satisfied with the verdict of the \"wise men\". \"It made clear that sanctions were unjust and had to be abolished.\" Meanwhile there were rumours in some quarters of Vienna yesterday that Mr Haider would interpret the lifting of sanctions as a green light to make a deal with the People's party which would give him a place in government, possibly as vice-chancellor. The \"wise men\" - the former Finnish president Martti Ahtisaari, the former Spanish foreign minister Marcelino Oreja, and international lawyer Jochen Frowein of Germany - were asked in June to report on the situation in Austria, after months of impasse which came to divide the EU. It was their job to get governments off the hook when it became clear that cold-shouldering Vienna while EU business in fact continued as usual was having little positive effect.",

Eurotunnel has refused to recognise Aslef, which claims 230 members out of 270 train crew workers, but under pressure of employment rights legislation signed a single-union deal covering all staff with the Transport and General Workers' union. A limited overtime ban was called in protest last month.

The TGWU leadership says it has asked Eurotunnel to talk to Aslef, but the company is reluctant to deal separately with the drivers, who are among the lowest paid in the country, and risk having to pay more as a result. The strike call came as TUC delegates in Glasgow agreed to press Tony Blair to give all workers full employment rights on day one in a job and to remove some of the most serious restrictions on the union recognition legislation passed last year. The TUC wants recognition rights extended to workers in companies employing 20 people or fewer, the removal of the 40% yes vote ballot threshold and the right to reinstatement for all workers sacked for taking part in legal strikes. The congress also demanded the right for workers to take solidarity or \"secondary\" action, outlawed by the Thatcher government but provided for under International Labour Organisation conventions, signed by Britain. However, delegates rejected calls for the return of the closed shop and a motion from the National Union of Mineworkers urging support for those who refused to comply with anti-union laws. Arthur Scargill, NUM president, said trade unions needed to use their muscle on behalf of weaker groups such as pensioners, who were \"not strong enough to help themselves\".

      "bodyText": "The RUC yesterday arrested Billy Hutchinson, a member of the Northern Ireland assembly, after a car avoided a vehicle checkpoint in the Shankill Road in Belfast. The car was later found abandoned. Mr Hutchinson, who represents the Progressive Unionist Party, linked to the Ulster Volunteer Force, is believed to have been one of four men who got into the vehicle as police watched. He refused to allow himself to be searched, and was held for obstruction before being released pending inquiries. He was later at Stormont, where the first assembly meeting for the summer was suspended after a protest in the public gallery led by Gina Adair, wife of the notorious Ulster Freedom Fighters commander Johnny Adair. Mr Hutchinson was among those at whom Ms Adair and other women screamed abuse. She had protested at Downing Street on Saturday, demanding that her husband be freed after being rearrested three weeks ago, on the orders of the Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Mandelson, when a loyalist feud erupted in which three men were murdered. A meeting on Friday was unable to establish a truce.",

      "bodyText": "A drive to engage parents in their children's learning at school - including guides to the curriculum, a magazine and extra help over the internet - will be launched by the prime minister today. The Learning Journey guides to the national curriculum will offer tips on how parents can help and provide detailed descriptions of what children should achieve in each subject at the ages of seven, 11 and 14 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. They will be available free to parents on request. The tips for learning include discussing the merits of mobile phones to support learning information and communications technology skills, and posing maths questions while setting the video. \"Ministers have long said that parents are essential partners in their children's education - with this extra practical support, we are helping to turn that slogan into a reality,\" David Blunkett, the education secretary, writes today in Guardian education. The campaign, which he will launch with Tony Blair, is costing several million pounds and is backed by extensive television advertising. More than 25,000 copies of the parents' guides have been ordered by schools. Separate books are available for ages 3-7, 7-11 and secondary school. The primary school guides, about 80 pages each, have been extensively illustrated by Quentin Blake, the children's artist. The secondary guide is more than 120 pages long. Anticipating criticism, Mr Blunkett writes: \"I know sometimes people say government tries to preach or nanny people too much. But today's campaign is the exact opposite of that approach ... It narrows the gap between 'those in the know' and those unfamiliar with the complexities of the education system.\" The books explain how the curriculum works, which subjects are taught at each key stage, and the expected levels of attainment. They are aimed at encouraging adults to become involved in their children's education and, anxious to avoid charges of over-pressuring children, try to be positive and encouraging. The primary school book says: \"Some parents are afraid of doing the wrong thing ... the most important things you can do are: take an interest in what your child is learning at school, and encourage them to tell you about it; praise them when they have done well.\" The books also answer some of the most common questions from parents, such as \"What is a home-school agreement?\" and \"Should I help my child with homework?\" The secondary school book is slightly different in format. Its tips are more generalised, often to do with supporting homework. It also has a 32-page section on the key stage four curriculum for ages 14-16. The magazine, Parents and Schools, will be available free in schools and supermarkets. It includes advice on how to help children if they are being bullied and what to ask about at a parents' evening. Twelve guides on popular school topics such as electricity, Romans and plants are also launched today. The Department for Education's advice website for parents has been expanded, and next week the government is holding a \"parents' online week\" to help parents who, Mr Blunkett says today, \"feel left behind by new technology\". The guides are available by calling 0800 389 3899. \u0095 Sixth formers in England and Wales have a 50-hour week of lessons, homework and travelling under the broader new curriculum, the Secondary Heads Association said yesterday. Richard Fawcett, its president, said the revamped post-16 curriculum was squeezing out time for students to do paid part-time work. \"Many of them depend on this income,\" he added. Tips and targets - advice in the new guides: English, ages 3-7 Tip: Take a few moments to listen to different sounds with your child (perhaps rain, wind, sirens or aeroplanes). Pick out one of the sounds - can your child describe it in words? Encourage them to describe it in different ways. At first they might say 'it was loud' or 'it was quiet', but the harder they listen, the more they might be able to add other descriptions: 'It was low and growly ... it sounded slow.' Targets: Around age 7, most children are able to: \u0095 tell stories, and repeat rhymes and poems \u0095 learn new words and use them in conversation \u0095 change how they talk to different people, in a range of situations \u0095 give their views about events or ideas in what they read \u0095 read aloud and understand stories and information books \u0095 use more than one way to work out the meaning of unfamiliar words \u0095 write stories with a beginning, a middle and an end \u0095 use writing for different purposes, such as lists or instructions \u0095 use interesting vocabulary that suits the subject \u0095 choose words and details to interest the reader \u0095 write in sentences, using capital letters and full stops. Geography, ages 3-7 Tip: Food in our kitchens has been imported from countries all over the world. Pick out some packets of food from your kitchen cupboard and ask your child to find out where each came from by reading the label. Once your child has a list, get them to find out where these places are. Targets: Around age 7, most children are able to: \u0095 describe the main features of places they study, using geographical words like 'hill', 'river', 'motorway' \u0095 understand how places may be similar to and different from each other \u0095 recognise where things are and why they are there (for example, why a pedestrian crossing is on one part of a road rather than another) \u0095 spot changes in the places they study \u0095 see how people affect the environment \u0095 find out about places by observing them, asking and answering questions and using other resource such as maps and photographs \u0095 give their views about places. Maths, ages 7-11 Tip: As anyone who's tried to read a video instruction manual knows, setting the video can leave your head spinning. Get your child to do it.

How much space is left on the tape? Does the video use a 12 or 24-hour clock? What if the programme is running late - can they add a few extra minutes to allow for this? Targets: At around age 11, most children are able to: \u0095 tackle a problem using different approaches, trying out ideas of their own \u0095 apply maths to practical problems \u0095 multiply and divide decimals by 10 or 100, and whole numbers by 1000 in their heads \u0095 put in order a set of numbers with up to three decimal places \u0095 reduce a fraction to its simplest form (for example, 4/16 to 1/4) \u0095 work out fractions of numbers or quantities (for example, they should be able to work out 5/8 of 32, 7/10 of 40 and 9/100 of 400 centimetres) \u0095 understand that a percentage is a number of parts in every hundred, and work out simple percentages of whole numbers \u0095 know all the times tables and use them to divide as well as multiply \u0095 use paper and pencil methods of multiplying and dividing for harder calculations (for example, 434.25 x 8, 19 divided by 6 and 352 x 27). \u0095 use a protractor to measure angles to the nearest degree \u0095 calculate the perimeter and area of shapes that can be split into rectangles \u0095 read and plot coordinates in all four quadrants.

He campaigned to end apartheid, and has continued to chair the Coram's Fields trust in Bloomsbury, which runs a leafy playground founded by an 18th-century sea captain where unaccompanied adults are not allowed. It is a model Mr Dobson wants to see spread. Mr Dobson, beaten into third place by Ken Livingstone and Steve Norris last May, said he would not be \"raking over old coals\". An instinctive loyalist, he added: \"I welcome the opportunity to step back and say to the government: 'You are doing a lot of good things, but we need to do these additional good things'.\"",

Unless you've knocked back a few pints. About 14 or so. </p> <p>The main problem with the show isn't the boorish, infantile and unsophisticated nature of Murray's writing, although you'd think someone - the script editor, say - might have pointed out that flatulence, women saying swear words and sub-slapstick exploding beer pumps doesn't make great comedy and hasn't done since the 70s. Nor is it the feeling that Julia Sawalha is completely mortified at appearing in such an appalling show. It isn't even the overwhelming cheapness of the whole operation which, were it a supermarket, would make Kwik Save look like the Harrods Food Hall. The main problem with Time Gentlemen Please is, rather unfortunately, Al Murray himself. </p> <p>It would seem that no one has told Murray - and he hasn't worked it out for himself - that there is a difference between doing a character in front of a live audience in a comedy club (where 14 pints have sometimes been added to make the act hilarious) and acting on television. Hence, Murray still plays the Pub Landlord as if there are a couple of people in the back row craning their necks to see him, the visual equivalent of Lowri Turner's ver-y cle-ar e-nun-ci-a-tion. The result is emphatic over-acting, only amusing to the hard of thinking. Further, the joins between the plot of the episode, stringy as it was, and the catchphrases from Murray's live set are so apparent, a blind seamstress would have concealed them better, and the half-hearted performances turned in by the rest of the cast are all their predictable, one-dimensional characters deserve. And no, the fact that the Pub Landlord and the regulars are supposed to be a crass, unsympathetic bunch doesn't excuse the lameness of Time Gentlemen Please. As Fonto, the Red Indian Magician, said of the replacement for his magic horse, this is a one-trick pony. And even that trick ain't that great. </p> <p>While not as downright terrible as Time Gentlemen Please, <strong> Harry Enfield's Brand Spanking New Show</strong> (Sky One) was nonetheless disappointing. Most of the characters were pale and uninteresting and bar the occasional flash of sparkling writing and genuinely original characters - Strange Bob the football commentator, for example - you could have mistaken this brand spanking new show for a tired old repeat. With The Fast Show and The League of Gentlemen both proving how far sketch comedy can be pushed, Enfield needs to raise his game. If this is the best homemade programming Sky can find, they should stick to broadcasting Star Trek: Voyager three times a day. </p> <p>The last time I saw Cheri Lunghi - when she wasn't drinking coffee in a bathrobe - she was pretending to be a pigeon. That was in Little White Lies when she played Tara Fitzgerald's neighbour (enough to drive anyone to distraction admittedly), in which she poisoned her daughter and perched atop her roof cooing before leaping to splattered death on her patio. Now she turns up as a South African - or rather a \"Serth Efrikin\" - in <strong> A Likeness in Stone</strong> (BBC1), another middle-class murder mystery in which a body in a wardrobe in a submerged house (way down in the valley-oh) bobs up at a most inopportune moment. </p> <p>The body is Helena, murdered by her jealous boy-friend, though damned to death as much for her name as for her promiscuous ways. In dramas such as this, your card is marked if you're not called Fiona or Susan, Susannah at a push.

Either the world's greatest living chef, or, as the New York Post prefers, architect of \"the most arrogantly launched eatery in the history of the world\". Planet Hollywood? Gracious no! This is the only chef currently to hold six Michelin stars that we're talking about here. You might know some of his restaurants: Alain Ducasse in Paris, Le Louis XV Alain Ducasse in Monte Carlo, the Spoon Food and Wine by Alain Ducasse in Tokyo, or his soon to open Alain Ducasse au Plaza Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e in Paris. Where does the arrogance come into it, then? Not with any of the above, oddly enough. It's his New York diner that's been accused of taking itself a little too seriously. What's it called? Alain Ducasse at the Essex House. But it's not this titular feast of self-aggrandisement that's got the Big Apple's critics fulminating into their foie gras. Let me guess: it's the silk stools reserved for ladies' handbags? A minor irritation. The 20 pens - Tiffany or Gucci, sir? - from which diners can choose to sign off their credit card slips? Pointless, but no. The \"presentation of knives\" with each course, turning cutlery into a culinary headache? Merely a chef's quest for perfection. The real problem is that the food is - how can I put this? - rubbish. Sacre bleu! While seaweed-steamed halibut with sea urchin custard might sound like the stuff of dreams - if your dreams are of $160 prix fixe menus, minus tax, service and drinks - one critic has reported seeing diners spitting their grub out into their napkins. Linen, no doubt, woven from the finest Flanders flax? I expect so. How bad is it for M Ducasse? Let's just say it's possible to phone up and reserve a table. With just a few days' notice. Ducasse says: \"Quality has a price.\" Fortune magazine says: \"A new circle of hell.\" Do say: \"A table for 20 for this evening? No problem.\" Don't say: \"Is service included?\"",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The Two Cultures debate today seems more active and urgent inside the arts than between the arts and the sciences. \"Dumbing down\" has become shorthand for a miscellany of alleged failings, but central to the argument is the battle between the traditional arts and popular culture, between art as a pursuit fully appreciated only by a select band of initiates and culture as an expression and reflection of the talents of a very large number of people. This is more often to do with the subject than with the treatment of the subject: ie, all symphonies worthwhile, all pop music pap. It reaches a higher lunacy when otherwise unremarkable people declare that they do not watch television (fair enough) but in terms that make it clear that they are thereby awarding themselves a first-class honours degree. Theatre good, television bad. </p> <p>I am about to launch the 24th season of The South Bank Show, which will again include documentaries on what are often classified as high and low art, on classical and common - even vulgar - subjects. As I look through the list, I believe that the old distinctions are not only less and less relevant to what is actually going on, but increasingly the refuge of the merely snobbish - a champagne-and-canape view of the arts. </p> <p>Perhaps the root of the trouble is that popular culture was taken seriously in the 20th century by many of its creators and by intelligent and committed commentators. What the 20th century delivered to popular culture was a ticket to posterity. Films, records, CDs, television and tapes could preserve work that in previous centuries had been snuffed out. It put popular culture on a par with the traditional forms, which had long found ways to perpetuate themselves. </p> <p>Popular culture was and is the long-overdue arrival of the masses - and that is part of the trouble. Established culture has never liked the masses, and established culture in this country became hopelessly entangled in the class system, the control system - various systems of exclusion that are sometimes only distantly related to an appreciation of the arts themselves. </p> <p>To make matters worse, the 20th century's popular culture - in films and pop music alone - threw up an enormous number of highly talented writers, performers, directors and musicians, with an innovative energy that could make traditional forms seem staid. The fact that successive generations were far more likely to be enchanted by the new popular arts, such as cinema, than the historic, such as theatre, caused and still causes anxiety. This reaches absurdity as senior citizens of our official culture take it on themselves to expel whole activities such as films and rock music from the canon of what should be considered The Arts. </p> <p>I hope it goes without saying that great art continued to flow from traditional sources throughout the last century. In the long run the established forms may prove to have outshone the new. But popular culture must now be reckoned with. </p> <p>One of the questions it raises is this: how are we to judge what more powerfully influences us and, hence, what is stronger or better? See Schoenberg's Moses and Aaron, Madam Butterfly, Phantom of the Opera or Elvis Presley at Las Vegas, and how do we set about judging differences? The cultural diktat of our day still tells us that Schoenberg is superior to Presley; many people go along with that. But is this any more than obedience to hierarchies laid down before popular culture gave itself a true chance to be compared? </p> <p>We hear more and more about the brain, and we were told recently that Mozart is good for you - but is it better for you than Motown? How do we decide this outside subjective experience and - much less reliable - fashion, which plays such a colossal part in appreciation of the arts? Puccini and Andrew Lloyd-Webber are interesting in another way: both can appeal to mass audiences and also to those who have taken the trouble to become connoisseurs, and they can do so in the same piece of music. </p> <p>Many composers have found great satisfaction in using their best skills for mass audiences - Aaron Copland is a useful example. Do we get less out of his score for the film Of Mice and Men than we do out of his concert music? And, returning to Presley, those early songs bear a great deal of repetition - every bit as much as Schoenberg, and to more people. So the accepted notion that art is partly that which endures and bears retelling and re-examining holds as much for Elvis as it does for Moses and Aaron. </p> <p>But, the argument goes, there is an altogether different quality of experience between listening to Beethoven and listening to the Beatles. Different? Granted. Quality? That's difficult. There are times when Beethoven takes you into his music so overwhelmingly that you feel your skin will burst with the sound inside your body. Yet listening to or, better, listening and dancing to the Beatles can provoke a not dissimilar ecstasy. </p> <p>One danger in this argument for the old guard is that it undermines exclusivity. If just anyone can reach peaks of musical pleasure - through pop - where does that leave the vital pecking order (vital, that is, for centuries in societies that saw and often still see high art as primarily a social badge of honour)? </p> <p>There is the important argument of difficulty and complication. Surely Wagner is more difficult than Van Morrison. You need to know more to enjoy more, and from that discipline of learning flow benefits that are simply not available otherwise. There is truth in that. But is difficulty itself a virtue? Finnegans Wake is very complicated but it is not a patch on the simple-seeming Dubliners. Yeats' simplest poems are among his greatest. Self-consciously difficult pop music is very often dire. As importantly, is Van Morrison easy? Which contemporary Faber poet could write successful song lyrics? </p> <p>There is a rooted assumption that popular culture is easy, especially popular music. Millions who try and fail to create it find out the hard way that it is just that - hard. A simple test is to consider the doomed attempts of our greatest living operatic tenors to sing popular tunes. Almost always they are not just poor, but terrible. They can't swing, they have no rhythm. They are afraid to leave the notes on the page; that magnificent growth in the throat gets in the way all the time. Pavarotti could never sing like Presley because he has neither the talent nor the training.

      "bodyText": "The Two Cultures debate today seems more active and urgent inside the arts than between the arts and the sciences. \"Dumbing down\" has become shorthand for a miscellany of alleged failings, but central to the argument is the battle between the traditional arts and popular culture, between art as a pursuit fully appreciated only by a select band of initiates and culture as an expression and reflection of the talents of a very large number of people. This is more often to do with the subject than with the treatment of the subject: ie, all symphonies worthwhile, all pop music pap. It reaches a higher lunacy when otherwise unremarkable people declare that they do not watch television (fair enough) but in terms that make it clear that they are thereby awarding themselves a first-class honours degree. Theatre good, television bad. I am about to launch the 24th season of The South Bank Show, which will again include documentaries on what are often classified as high and low art, on classical and common - even vulgar - subjects. As I look through the list, I believe that the old distinctions are not only less and less relevant to what is actually going on, but increasingly the refuge of the merely snobbish - a champagne-and-canape view of the arts. Perhaps the root of the trouble is that popular culture was taken seriously in the 20th century by many of its creators and by intelligent and committed commentators. What the 20th century delivered to popular culture was a ticket to posterity. Films, records, CDs, television and tapes could preserve work that in previous centuries had been snuffed out. It put popular culture on a par with the traditional forms, which had long found ways to perpetuate themselves. Popular culture was and is the long-overdue arrival of the masses - and that is part of the trouble. Established culture has never liked the masses, and established culture in this country became hopelessly entangled in the class system, the control system - various systems of exclusion that are sometimes only distantly related to an appreciation of the arts themselves. To make matters worse, the 20th century's popular culture - in films and pop music alone - threw up an enormous number of highly talented writers, performers, directors and musicians, with an innovative energy that could make traditional forms seem staid. The fact that successive generations were far more likely to be enchanted by the new popular arts, such as cinema, than the historic, such as theatre, caused and still causes anxiety. This reaches absurdity as senior citizens of our official culture take it on themselves to expel whole activities such as films and rock music from the canon of what should be considered The Arts. I hope it goes without saying that great art continued to flow from traditional sources throughout the last century. In the long run the established forms may prove to have outshone the new. But popular culture must now be reckoned with. One of the questions it raises is this: how are we to judge what more powerfully influences us and, hence, what is stronger or better? See Schoenberg's Moses and Aaron, Madam Butterfly, Phantom of the Opera or Elvis Presley at Las Vegas, and how do we set about judging differences? The cultural diktat of our day still tells us that Schoenberg is superior to Presley; many people go along with that. But is this any more than obedience to hierarchies laid down before popular culture gave itself a true chance to be compared? We hear more and more about the brain, and we were told recently that Mozart is good for you - but is it better for you than Motown? How do we decide this outside subjective experience and - much less reliable - fashion, which plays such a colossal part in appreciation of the arts? Puccini and Andrew Lloyd-Webber are interesting in another way: both can appeal to mass audiences and also to those who have taken the trouble to become connoisseurs, and they can do so in the same piece of music. Many composers have found great satisfaction in using their best skills for mass audiences - Aaron Copland is a useful example. Do we get less out of his score for the film Of Mice and Men than we do out of his concert music? And, returning to Presley, those early songs bear a great deal of repetition - every bit as much as Schoenberg, and to more people. So the accepted notion that art is partly that which endures and bears retelling and re-examining holds as much for Elvis as it does for Moses and Aaron. But, the argument goes, there is an altogether different quality of experience between listening to Beethoven and listening to the Beatles. Different? Granted. Quality? That's difficult. There are times when Beethoven takes you into his music so overwhelmingly that you feel your skin will burst with the sound inside your body. Yet listening to or, better, listening and dancing to the Beatles can provoke a not dissimilar ecstasy. One danger in this argument for the old guard is that it undermines exclusivity. If just anyone can reach peaks of musical pleasure - through pop - where does that leave the vital pecking order (vital, that is, for centuries in societies that saw and often still see high art as primarily a social badge of honour)? There is the important argument of difficulty and complication. Surely Wagner is more difficult than Van Morrison. You need to know more to enjoy more, and from that discipline of learning flow benefits that are simply not available otherwise. There is truth in that. But is difficulty itself a virtue? Finnegans Wake is very complicated but it is not a patch on the simple-seeming Dubliners. Yeats' simplest poems are among his greatest. Self-consciously difficult pop music is very often dire. As importantly, is Van Morrison easy? Which contemporary Faber poet could write successful song lyrics? There is a rooted assumption that popular culture is easy, especially popular music. Millions who try and fail to create it find out the hard way that it is just that - hard. A simple test is to consider the doomed attempts of our greatest living operatic tenors to sing popular tunes. Almost always they are not just poor, but terrible. They can't swing, they have no rhythm. They are afraid to leave the notes on the page; that magnificent growth in the throat gets in the way all the time. Pavarotti could never sing like Presley because he has neither the talent nor the training. Nureyev, although he longed to, could never dance like Fred Astaire. To prefer Placido Domingo to Robbie Williams or vice versa is easy, and what we all do. To try to prove that preference is likely to be very tricky. And, once again, there are figures dancing across the landscape - Leonard Bernstein is one example, David Hockney another - who cut across entrenched positions and make a mockery of them. We face this head on every year when putting together a new season of The South Bank Show.

There is already far more cross-border activity and associated enabling regulation in the highly developed world than many people are aware of. The issue of legislation about hi-tech professionals now being debated in many of these countries is only a further instance of what is already being done in other economic sectors that are less visible.</p> <p>There is a set of provisions in the World Trade Organisation regulations concerning the cross-border mobility of professional workers in finance, telecommunications and a broad range of highly specialised services.</p> <p>Such regimes for the circulation of service workers also exist in many of the regional free-trade agreements as part of the liberalisation of international trade and investment in services. The North American Free Trade Agreement, for one, contains such provisions, even though it was negotiated as an agreement that had nothing to do with cross-border flows of workers.</p> <p>Other forms of such provisions are, for example, the sharp expansion in so-called \"business visas\" in the US over the last decade and, on a much more basic level, the new immigration law passed in Japan in 1990 that opened up the country to foreign professionals in finance, accounting, and other related fields.</p> <p>It would seem that economic globalisation brings with it a need for more flexible cross-border labour circulation.</p> <p>These Nafta and WTO provisions amount to a form of \"migrant worker policy\", although they are addressed to highly specialised workers, and the concept of \"migrant worker\" is usually avoided.</p> <p>The existence of these provisions is little-known even among experts on economic globalisation and immigration, let alone the general public. There was no public outcry when these provisions were instituted.</p> <p>When these kinds of provisions are part of an immigration policy, they are far more likely to become known and subject to public debate and scrutiny.</p> <p>And while these provisions are a regime for labour migration, they are so with one big difference: making such provisions part of the WTO or Nafta means an institutional reshuffling of some of the components of sovereign power over entry on to supranational institutions. It would be worthwhile debating whether it is preferably to have them discreetly incorporated into free trade agreements or made part of immigration policy.</p> <p>The incorporation into WTO and Nafta-type treaties of these provisions for the cross-border mobility of professionals and business persons signals the difficulty of not explicitly dealing with the circulation of people in the implementation of free trade and investment frameworks.</p> <p>In their own specific ways each of these efforts - whether it is the WTO, Nafta, or the far more elaborate case of the European Union - has had in the end to address cross-border labour circulation.</p> <p>So the debate about whether or not to allow the entry of foreign hi-tech workers is but one element of a far broader and more fundamental reconfiguring of specialised labour markets under the impact of economic globalisation.</p> <p>It is extremely important that this be done in the form of a public debate rather than discreetly shifted to institutional domains in practice not subject to public scrutiny.</p> <p>We need to recognise that the issue of the admission of hi-tech workers is only one in a long line of such initiatives. We are already doing it with a variety of regimes and a variety of workers - not only with the familiar cases of maids, nannies, and nurses, but also with professionals in finance, accounting and law. And a far larger set of cases are to come.</p> <p>\u0095 The author is professor of sociology at the University of Chicago<br> <a href=\"mailto:ssassen@midway.uchicago.edu\">ssassen@midway.uchicago.edu</a></p>",

There is already far more cross-border activity and associated enabling regulation in the highly developed world than many people are aware of. The issue of legislation about hi-tech professionals now being debated in many of these countries is only a further instance of what is already being done in other economic sectors that are less visible. There is a set of provisions in the World Trade Organisation regulations concerning the cross-border mobility of professional workers in finance, telecommunications and a broad range of highly specialised services. Such regimes for the circulation of service workers also exist in many of the regional free-trade agreements as part of the liberalisation of international trade and investment in services. The North American Free Trade Agreement, for one, contains such provisions, even though it was negotiated as an agreement that had nothing to do with cross-border flows of workers. Other forms of such provisions are, for example, the sharp expansion in so-called \"business visas\" in the US over the last decade and, on a much more basic level, the new immigration law passed in Japan in 1990 that opened up the country to foreign professionals in finance, accounting, and other related fields. It would seem that economic globalisation brings with it a need for more flexible cross-border labour circulation. These Nafta and WTO provisions amount to a form of \"migrant worker policy\", although they are addressed to highly specialised workers, and the concept of \"migrant worker\" is usually avoided. The existence of these provisions is little-known even among experts on economic globalisation and immigration, let alone the general public. There was no public outcry when these provisions were instituted. When these kinds of provisions are part of an immigration policy, they are far more likely to become known and subject to public debate and scrutiny. And while these provisions are a regime for labour migration, they are so with one big difference: making such provisions part of the WTO or Nafta means an institutional reshuffling of some of the components of sovereign power over entry on to supranational institutions. It would be worthwhile debating whether it is preferably to have them discreetly incorporated into free trade agreements or made part of immigration policy. The incorporation into WTO and Nafta-type treaties of these provisions for the cross-border mobility of professionals and business persons signals the difficulty of not explicitly dealing with the circulation of people in the implementation of free trade and investment frameworks. In their own specific ways each of these efforts - whether it is the WTO, Nafta, or the far more elaborate case of the European Union - has had in the end to address cross-border labour circulation. So the debate about whether or not to allow the entry of foreign hi-tech workers is but one element of a far broader and more fundamental reconfiguring of specialised labour markets under the impact of economic globalisation. It is extremely important that this be done in the form of a public debate rather than discreetly shifted to institutional domains in practice not subject to public scrutiny. We need to recognise that the issue of the admission of hi-tech workers is only one in a long line of such initiatives. We are already doing it with a variety of regimes and a variety of workers - not only with the familiar cases of maids, nannies, and nurses, but also with professionals in finance, accounting and law. And a far larger set of cases are to come. \u0095 The author is professor of sociology at the University of Chicago ssassen@midway.uchicago.edu",

Displaying Tracey Emin's My Bed, the centrepiece of Emin's 1999 Turner prize show, appears premature, as it was last given an airing a mere nine months ago.

My Bed deserves a bit of a break. </p> <p>There is more point, perhaps, in displaying Jake and Dinos Chapman's etchings after Goya, or Gavin Turk's realistic, life-sized Death of Che - a life-cast of Turk as the revolutionary, in army fatigues, dead on his cement slab - if only because both are given more breathing space here than in their earlier exhibitions. However, the sculptural excerpt from Sarah Lucas's intervention at the Freud Museum earlier this year demands - like Emin's bed - a more confined and even domestic setting in order for it to work. </p> <p>Is this the moment to reconsider these works? Ant Noises 2 does nothing for the reputation of the generation of artists whom Charles Saatchi packaged in his previous exhibitions and in the book Young British Art: The Saatchi Decade, published last year. Sure, many of these artists have made terrific works at one time or another in their decade-long careers, but shows like this add nothing to our appreciation of them. I almost want to issue a disclaimer with this article: Warning - this review contains the regurgitated, twice-cooked remains of a partly digested product that has previously appeared in these pages. </p> <p>Neither Horror at Home, Damien Hirst's 1995 giant ashtray, as big as a paddling pool and inches deep in fag-ends, nor his 1998 vitrine, Contemplating a Self Portrait (as a Pharmacist), represent him at his best, his most dramatic or portentous. The vitrine is a painter's studio, replete with easel, unfinished painting, gungy palette and other paraphernalia. A big mirror at the rear of the vitrine faces the easel, as though the painter were about to embark on a self-portrait. The words I Love You are lipsticked onto the mirror. As a work about a painter's narcissism, it's all a bit flat. </p> <p>Hirst's 1999 suite of prints, The Last Supper, is a series of silkscreened images of pharmaceutical packages, the drugs' brand names replaced by the more homely Steak and Kidney, Omelette, Salad, Sandwich and the like. The perfect, fake pharmaceutical blister-pack for Spiritualized's 1997 CD Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space was, I have to say, a much more thoroughgoing gag in the same vein, even if the music was a bore. </p> <p>Rubbing shoulders with Hirst is Jenny Saville, the painter whom Saatchi has continued to support throughout her otherwise undistinguished career. Her painting here depicts the flank of a supine sow, a row of teats thrown into high, shadowed relief against yards of pinky-grey pork belly, which she paints in the same slappy, tiresome way as she renders human female flesh. Taking me to task over my opinion of Saville's work, one critic said that her detractors were all failed painters themselves or teachers at Goldsmiths College. I have been both in my time, and still feel I am entitled to think she's no good. </p> <p>As a collector, Saatchi may be brave at times. He is entitled to make mistakes, and to go on making mistakes. But he is also very close to being a dealer, even when he would perhaps like us to see him as a one-man museum, albeit one that offloads its acquisitions with alarming frequency. Writing about Ant Noises 1, I ventured the observation that some artists did not want to sell to Saatchi, especially as they frequently have had next to no control over the way their works have been shown. The morning the article appeared, the Saatchi Gallery called to tell me how upsetting Saatchi had found my remarks, and demanded a list of names of the artists. \"If we don't have the names by four o'clock, we'll ring your editor!\" I was told. Oo-er. I'm still not telling. </p> <p>Artists' relationships with their collectors are often, even at best, ambivalent. An old, sick joke had it that Mark Rothko killed himself because he met the people who bought his art. If we had more collectors in this country with Saatchi's clout, all this really wouldn't matter, but we are forced to deal with him, as well as with all the art he shows. Maybe he wants to be an artist too, maybe he wants to write himself into art history. In a sense he has already succeeded. </p> <p>Just like Tracey Emin. Here is a picture of the artist, legs apart, piles of money heaped around her crotch: Tracey in the money, the money in Tracey, or very nearly so. Her beach hut, a perfectly ordinary, weatherbeaten clapboard hut, with its rickety walls and peeling layers of gloss paint, is beached on the gallery floor. It is a very nice beach hut, distressed by the sun and rain and wind. It would look even better on the Whitstable foreshore, whence it comes. Emin's pictures, and the title given to the displaced hut, The Last Thing I Said to You Is Don't Leave Me Here, beg all sorts of stories. </p> <p>Buildings, like beds and rooms, always have stories to tell. There are stories everywhere - even in the Saatchi Gallery. It is the way you tell 'em that matters, or maybe staying out of sight and leaving such things to speak for themselves can count for even more. Emin seems incapable of such reserve. The hut has become a kind of stage-prop in the endless, dramatised retelling of her own life. Perhaps we should look at it in the same way that we regard Dr Johnson's summer house at Kenwood, or George Bernard Shaw's writing shed at Ayot St Lawrence, and imagine Emin's lost summer days, the drunken parties and tearful nights, the estuary tide lapping on the mud. But now the hut is in the gallery and there is nowhere left to hide, no breathing space, no retreat. Even the sanctuary of the painter's studio, nakedly exposed in Hirst's vitrine, has become an object for public consumption.

I imagine it to be loads of girls sitting round a table doing knitting and sewing.\" And those who are guides get teased by peers at school, more since starting secondary school than at primary school, and more by boys than by girls. \"Going to a youth group here I can do activities with boys and girls. This is more my idea of fun than being in a girls-only group.\"</p> <p>But Erica Bell, who has faithfully stuck with the Guide Association since the age of five when she was a Rainbow and is now 15, disagrees. \"When I was younger some of the activities were quite boring but there's much more choice now. A lot of my friends go to guides and although there's a bit of teasing at school we don't care. It's nice for us girls to have our own space without boys who can be very stupid at this age and just mess around. I think one of the most important things I've got from guides is the chance and the confidence to try new things. Even if you find you don't like something it's always worth having a try.\"</p> <p>Her mum Sue, a guide leader, thinks it's important that girls have an environment where they can let their hair down and not be affected by what boys think. \"Girls are much more streetwise these days and they're getting older younger, but at the end of the day they still want to have a good time.\"</p> <p>One thing that girls inside and outside the guides agree upon is that during their early teenage years they just want to have fun. How they do that keeps changing but, in a society where the culture of self takes centre stage, enticing teenage girls into organised groups is proving a continuing challenge.</p> <p>\u0095 For more information about the guides, visit <a href=\"http://www.guides.org.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.guides.org.uk</a></p>",

This is more my idea of fun than being in a girls-only group.\" But Erica Bell, who has faithfully stuck with the Guide Association since the age of five when she was a Rainbow and is now 15, disagrees. \"When I was younger some of the activities were quite boring but there's much more choice now. A lot of my friends go to guides and although there's a bit of teasing at school we don't care. It's nice for us girls to have our own space without boys who can be very stupid at this age and just mess around. I think one of the most important things I've got from guides is the chance and the confidence to try new things. Even if you find you don't like something it's always worth having a try.\" Her mum Sue, a guide leader, thinks it's important that girls have an environment where they can let their hair down and not be affected by what boys think. \"Girls are much more streetwise these days and they're getting older younger, but at the end of the day they still want to have a good time.\" One thing that girls inside and outside the guides agree upon is that during their early teenage years they just want to have fun. How they do that keeps changing but, in a society where the culture of self takes centre stage, enticing teenage girls into organised groups is proving a continuing challenge. \u0095 For more information about the guides, visit www.guides.org.uk",

And for that you need the people to build software.</p> <p>\"Where software development is concerned schooling and training in India focuses more on academic study, perhaps to the exclusion of other things, and enforces the kind of analytical thinking used in developing software. In British schools life skills are much more stressed.</p> <p>\"In the end I found it surprisingly easy to move to Bristol. All our institutions in India are modelled on a British way of life and when I arrived it was much more familiar than I thought it would be,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Also, in areas like IT, the profession is beginning to command a higher loyalty than one's nationality. And that's not just true of India, but the UK as well. People here are moving abroad too.</p> <p>\"The process is much easier now. Rules and regulations for foreign workers have relaxed considerably since I arrived. There used to be many more bureaucratic hurdles as well as the suspicious attitude of officials. Any migration request had to be justified at every step of the way.</p> <p>\"Today it is much easier to persuade people that you are adding value. It is partly a case of global companies needing to be mobile, the boundaries are coming down.\"</p> <p>While Mr Oak and his family miss their network of friends in Bombay, they do not miss the noise and pollution levels or the extremities of poverty on the streets.</p> <p>However, Mr Oak is concerned about the schooling of his son, Neeraj, 11. Although he fitted in well at primary level and has now won a scholarship to a public school, Mr Oak said academic standards are not as rigorous as those in India.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Raju Oak, 40, is in charge of customer relations management and e-business for Mastek UK, a software development firm in Bristol. He moved from Bombay, India, just over four years ago and was followed two months later by his wife and son. Mr Oak said he was employed in Britain to plug a shortfall in information technology and project management skills. \"There are fairly significant shortages in the UK in both these areas and there have been for some time,\" he said. \"What the UK is excellent at is structuring businesses, but you need to deliver what you promise. And for that you need the people to build software. \"Where software development is concerned schooling and training in India focuses more on academic study, perhaps to the exclusion of other things, and enforces the kind of analytical thinking used in developing software. In British schools life skills are much more stressed. \"In the end I found it surprisingly easy to move to Bristol. All our institutions in India are modelled on a British way of life and when I arrived it was much more familiar than I thought it would be,\" he said. \"Also, in areas like IT, the profession is beginning to command a higher loyalty than one's nationality. And that's not just true of India, but the UK as well. People here are moving abroad too. \"The process is much easier now. Rules and regulations for foreign workers have relaxed considerably since I arrived. There used to be many more bureaucratic hurdles as well as the suspicious attitude of officials. Any migration request had to be justified at every step of the way. \"Today it is much easier to persuade people that you are adding value. It is partly a case of global companies needing to be mobile, the boundaries are coming down.\" While Mr Oak and his family miss their network of friends in Bombay, they do not miss the noise and pollution levels or the extremities of poverty on the streets. However, Mr Oak is concerned about the schooling of his son, Neeraj, 11. Although he fitted in well at primary level and has now won a scholarship to a public school, Mr Oak said academic standards are not as rigorous as those in India.",

      "bodyText": "Eddie Izzard was the toast of Hollywood after winning two Emmys in the annual television awards ceremony in Los Angeles for his show Dressed To Kill. His victories came on a night of surprises with unfancied programmes picking up awards and shows with gay themes being honoured. He won Emmys for writing the show and for his performance, beating American gag writing heavyweights such as fellow nominees on the Late Show With David Letterman and Late Night With Conan O'Brien, but was too busy working to pick up the award on Sunday night. His show was filmed for American channel HBO at the Stage Door theatre in San Francisco in 1998, and his unique blend of rambling humour and transvestism has also played to sold out houses in New York and Los Angeles. The White House-based drama series, The West Wing, picked up most awards. The series, which stars Martin Sheen as the liberal president and Rob Lowe, took a record nine awards, including best drama series. It surpassed the record of eight awards set by Hill Street Blues and equalled by ER. The Sopranos, nominated in 18 categories, had to be content with James Gandolfini's solo effort which he attributed to the judges' \"affinity for slightly overweight bald men\". Gandolfini, the star of The Sopranos, the acclaimed drama series about a New Jersey mob family, won the best actor award most critics believed should have been his last year. Vanessa Redgrave won a best supporting role for her part in the lesbian love story, If These Walls Could Talk 2, which also starred Sharon Stone, Ellen DeGeneres and Chloe Sevigny. There was an emotional reception for Michael J Fox's best actor in a comedy series award. He left Spin City because of Parkinson's disease. Bruce Willis picked up the best guest performance in a series for his role in Friends but the hit comedy programme, along with ER, Ally McBeal, Frasier and Sex in the City, was otherwise virtually ignored. Jennifer Aniston had been tipped for best comedy actress but the award went to Megan Mullally for Will &amp; Grace, the comedy about a gay man and a straight woman. The BBC's prehistoric documentary series Walking With Dinosaurs was named best animated programme of more than 60 minutes and won technical awards for its visual effects and sound editing. Gary Shandling, star of the Larry Sanders show, hosted the event and poked fun at the proliferation of \"reality\" shows such as Big Brother and Survivor which are currently eating up the ratings. \" \"I think real people should not be on television,\" he said. \"It's for special people like us, people who have trained and studied to appear real.\" Traditionally the Emmy nominations were made by people who attended a special weekend screening which disqualified many people unable to attend due to work.

She told a jury at the Old Bailey she became pregnant after Edwards called at her home in Buckinghamshire one night in April 1984 and demanded sex. The woman, now 35, sobbed as she denied suggestions that she agreed to sleep with Edwards. Edwards, 39, an engineering welder, of Sydenham, south-east London, denies raping a 23-year-old mother, Miss D, in his flat in 1998. But Miss N and four other women are giving evidence in court in an unusual legal move because the prosecution alleges that their experiences with Edwards bear \"striking similarities\". The women in each alleged incident say Edwards raped them, but he says they were willing sexual partners. Later, Miss S told the court that Edwards raped her in 1985 when she was 17. Miss S confirmed that Edwards had been convicted at Reading crown court of raping her. Earlier Miss N confirmed that Edwards had been cleared of rape in her case. The trial continues today.

But oil spills are responsible for only a small proportion of oil in the sea. According to the United Nations Environment Programme (Unep), of the millions of tonnes of oil discharged into the sea, ships release only about half and much of this is deliberately flushed into the sea as tankers clean their tanks. The rest of the oil comes from routine discharges from land-based industrial plant. </p> <p><strong> Marine environment</strong><br> </p> <p> Oil has been proved to affect the reproduction and physiology of fish, shellfish and plankton. However, no two oil spills produce identical effects on the environment and recovery rates may vary from a matter of weeks to more than 10 years. The key factor determining how quickly the environment can recover is the type of oil and the quantities spilt. Oil is composed of hundreds of compounds, some of which are toxic and may cause cancer, and it can be broadly divided into light crudes, which disperse easily, and heavy crudes, which form thick slicks. Light crudes may disappear more quickly from the surface, but their toxicity may last longer. There is no clear correlation between the size of a spill and the extent of the damage. Other factors that influence the environmental impact are whether dispersants are used, whether the sea is rough, the temperature of the water, the presence of bacteria that can digest the oil, whether the shore line is rocky or sandy and the mix of species in the area of the spill. </p> <p><strong> Incidents</strong><br> </p> <p> The National Centre for Scientific Research in France has estimated that a shipping incident occurs every two to three days worldwide, and between 1992 and 1999 the UK Marine Accident Investigation Branch recorded 148 tanker accidents. Between 1992 and 1999, the top five foreign flags involved in tanker accidents were the Bahamas, Norway, Gibraltar, Liberia and Malta. The two worst incidents to affect the UK in the last decade have been the Braer in 1993, when 84,500 tonnes of light crude was spilt off the Shetland Islands and the Sea Empress in 1996, when 130,000 tonnes of Forties crude was spilt off the Pembrokeshire coast. </p> <p><strong> Safeguards</strong><br> </p> <p> Environmental groups believe that all new tankers should be built to a minimum design/construction standard and that all existing ships should be updated to these standards as soon as possible.

      "body": "<p>The Guardian has a slightly dubious - and mostly unjustified - reputation for sloppy spelling. In reality, as the \"Grauniad\" legend shows, typos and true spelling mistakes are very different sins. Leaving out the odd letter in an email is more likely to be due to haste than ignorance. </p> <p>Poor spelling can be a sign of dyslexia - but it is far from the only symptom (see <a href=\"http://www.bda-dyslexia.org.uk\">www.bda-dyslexia.org.uk</a> for some of the others). Mark Twain blamed it on the non-phonetic (or \"non-fonetic\", as he put it) nature of English, and believed that it made it harder for immigrants to the US to obtain citizenship. He even appealed for the Associated Press to adopt a phonetic spelling system (<a href=\"http://www.marktwain.about.com/arts/marktwain/library/ speeches/bl_spelling.htm\">www.marktwain.about.com</a>). </p> <p>At the Simplified Spelling Society's site (<a href=\"http://www.les.aston.ac.uk/sss/\">www.les.aston.ac.uk</a>) you can download programs to convert traditional spellings to reformed versions. Sadly, the organisations cannot agree on a single system - not least because dialects and accents would render any attempt at standardisation impossible. </p> <p>One self-confessed \"bad speller\" would like to see pronunciation follow spelling, rather than vice versa: \"I can only spell 'anemone' because my biology teacher would always say it exactly like that... when I write it, it is an-e-mone, not an-em-on-ee.\" </p> <p>\"Mostly,\" writes another poor speller, \"it was boring. At school I had to learn lists of words that I was tested on.\" Yet this approach, which David Blunkett's recent list of 600 recommended spellings for 11-year-olds seems likely to encourage, is not the only way to tackle the problem. As the BBC's spelling resource (<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/revisewise/english/spelling/\">www.bbc.co.uk/education</a>) and the Guardian's <a href=\"http://www.learn.co.uk/default.asp?WCI=Lesson&amp;WCU=\" 158\"\"> learn.co.uk </a>site show, strategies for \"understanding\" the structure and sounds of words do exist. The BBC encourages children's confidence by employing Shakespeare, a notoriously inconsistent speller, as its guide. </p> <p>The Basic Skills Agency (<a href=\"http://www.basic-skills.co.uk\">www.basic-skills.co.uk</a>) can help those with poor spelling. </p> <p>\u0095 The list of 600 recommended spellings can be found at: <a href=\"http://www.educationunlimited.co.uk/news/story/0,5500,364235,00.html\">www.educationunlimited.co.uk</a> </p> <p> The Guardian's education site, Education Unlimited, is looking for website reviewers to help expand its Netclass section. If you have expertise in a subject (or level) and experience of the national curriculum, or teach in an FE college, email: <a href=\"mailto:editor@educationunlimited.co.uk\"> editor@educationunlimited.co.uk</a> before September 22.</p>",

In reality, as the \"Grauniad\" legend shows, typos and true spelling mistakes are very different sins. Leaving out the odd letter in an email is more likely to be due to haste than ignorance. Poor spelling can be a sign of dyslexia - but it is far from the only symptom (see www.bda-dyslexia.org.uk for some of the others). Mark Twain blamed it on the non-phonetic (or \"non-fonetic\", as he put it) nature of English, and believed that it made it harder for immigrants to the US to obtain citizenship. He even appealed for the Associated Press to adopt a phonetic spelling system (www.marktwain.about.com). At the Simplified Spelling Society's site (www.les.aston.ac.uk) you can download programs to convert traditional spellings to reformed versions. Sadly, the organisations cannot agree on a single system - not least because dialects and accents would render any attempt at standardisation impossible. One self-confessed \"bad speller\" would like to see pronunciation follow spelling, rather than vice versa: \"I can only spell 'anemone' because my biology teacher would always say it exactly like that... when I write it, it is an-e-mone, not an-em-on-ee.\" \"Mostly,\" writes another poor speller, \"it was boring. At school I had to learn lists of words that I was tested on.\" Yet this approach, which David Blunkett's recent list of 600 recommended spellings for 11-year-olds seems likely to encourage, is not the only way to tackle the problem. As the BBC's spelling resource (www.bbc.co.uk/education) and the Guardian's learn.co.uk site show, strategies for \"understanding\" the structure and sounds of words do exist. The BBC encourages children's confidence by employing Shakespeare, a notoriously inconsistent speller, as its guide. The Basic Skills Agency (www.basic-skills.co.uk) can help those with poor spelling. \u0095 The list of 600 recommended spellings can be found at: www.educationunlimited.co.uk The Guardian's education site, Education Unlimited, is looking for website reviewers to help expand its Netclass section. If you have expertise in a subject (or level) and experience of the national curriculum, or teach in an FE college, email: editor@educationunlimited.co.uk before September 22.",

      "body": "<p><strong>Susan Rees</strong> is an adviser with the Advisory Centre for Education: </p> <p> Banner headlines on truancy tend to portray an alarming but simplistic picture, which belies the subtleties and complexities surrounding the problem. </p> <p>At one end of the scale, children may miss lessons through boredom or complete disaffection with school; at the other, there are the school refusers who will not attend due to a range of anxieties. In the middle are those who either miss specific lessons, or indulge in a bit of \"bunking\", usually as a one-off incident. </p> <p>One thing is true of all of these - the school will take it seriously, as will the local education authority. There's increasing pressure to meet attendance targets, and they will expect you as parents to take it seriously, too. </p> <p>This can mean that schools focus on the effects of truancy, as opposed to tackling its causes. And this is where parents should start. Find out why your child is missing lessons, and then take the matter up with the school. You do have a legal duty to send your child to school, but if a 13-year-old refuses point blank to go, it's unrealistic to think that you can physically make them. </p> <p>There can be many reasons why young people don't want to attend a particular lesson or school day - ranging from fear of bullying or a clash with a particular teacher through to worries about finding a subject too hard. In this case, you and the school can act on the specific cause of the problem, and work towards a solution. It's important to make clear to your child that you don't approve of them \"opting out\", but taking a strong disciplinary stance will rarely help. </p> <p>Look for patterns of behaviour as early as possible, and find out the underlying triggers for non-attendance. Sometimes, they may have little ostensively to do with school itself, but can escalate to the point where a child may be deemed \"school-phobic\". Some children may have real anxieties about leaving their parent(s), or find the transition from home to school traumatic. Here, intervention by the school's learning support department may be needed, or contact your local education authority and seek advice from an education officer. </p> <p>Don't forget your son is undergoing all the pain and confusion of adolescence - so he may be sullen and disaffected.

      "bodyText": "Susan Rees is an adviser with the Advisory Centre for Education: Banner headlines on truancy tend to portray an alarming but simplistic picture, which belies the subtleties and complexities surrounding the problem. At one end of the scale, children may miss lessons through boredom or complete disaffection with school; at the other, there are the school refusers who will not attend due to a range of anxieties. In the middle are those who either miss specific lessons, or indulge in a bit of \"bunking\", usually as a one-off incident. One thing is true of all of these - the school will take it seriously, as will the local education authority. There's increasing pressure to meet attendance targets, and they will expect you as parents to take it seriously, too. This can mean that schools focus on the effects of truancy, as opposed to tackling its causes. And this is where parents should start. Find out why your child is missing lessons, and then take the matter up with the school. You do have a legal duty to send your child to school, but if a 13-year-old refuses point blank to go, it's unrealistic to think that you can physically make them. There can be many reasons why young people don't want to attend a particular lesson or school day - ranging from fear of bullying or a clash with a particular teacher through to worries about finding a subject too hard. In this case, you and the school can act on the specific cause of the problem, and work towards a solution. It's important to make clear to your child that you don't approve of them \"opting out\", but taking a strong disciplinary stance will rarely help. Look for patterns of behaviour as early as possible, and find out the underlying triggers for non-attendance. Sometimes, they may have little ostensively to do with school itself, but can escalate to the point where a child may be deemed \"school-phobic\". Some children may have real anxieties about leaving their parent(s), or find the transition from home to school traumatic. Here, intervention by the school's learning support department may be needed, or contact your local education authority and seek advice from an education officer. Don't forget your son is undergoing all the pain and confusion of adolescence - so he may be sullen and disaffected. Some schools and teachers deal well with teenage issues, but others don't. If a teacher has rubbed your son up the wrong way, sit down again and identify with your child what has caused the problem, and then ask the school for guidance. Around the age of 14 or 15 the likelihood of youngsters becoming totally disillusioned and disaffected with school is at its highest. This is also the age where more exclusions occur.

      "body": "<p>As it should do, given the cost, the grandest and most expensive research project into further education will be tossing some big questions around. </p> <p>The biggest, actually: how do students learn and how are they taught? </p> <p>At first sight it seems staggering that we need to ponder these questions. Picture the rage and panic if the pilot of a Jumbo jet taxiing to take off casually informs passengers that he is one of the guinea pigs in an investigation to find out how people fly planes. </p> <p>For fly, substitute teach and learn, and this is effectively what hundreds of students at four colleges around the country will be told by their tutors. Both students and tutors will be key players in the venture, says Professor Martin Bloomer, of Exeter university, who is heading the four-year project from a rather pokey office on the St Luke's college campus. </p> <p>The common research model is for academics to take a detached, lofty view of the people they are observing, like zoologists viewing the antics of cobras safely from behind thick glass, giving the occasional poke with long sticks. Teachers, like the snakes, understandably can react badly to this approach. </p> <p>\"Here the academics and practitioners are partners in the research,\" says Bloomer. \"We want the teachers to lead. We want them to suggest topics to focus on.\" </p> <p>Misunderstanding is inevitable when nitty gritty mysteries like the human gene map or the mechanics of learning are under assault. The local BBC news has just described the four-year research programme as a government-funded venture designed to boost standards across further education. </p> <p>Not an entirely ludicrous precis, surely. The further education limb is an \u00a3815,000 chunk of a \u00a312.5m programme entitled the Teaching and Learning research project, and a good \u00a32m of the cost comes from the Department for Education. Most of the cash can be tracked back to the taxpayer one way or another. </p> <p>And hasn't David Blunkett signalled his wish for educational research which is paid for with public money to have feasible application for teachers and lecturers? </p> <p>The venture is sponsored by the Economic and Social Research Council and is thus independent of government, Bloomer declares. </p> <p>And any suggestion that the professor and his four partner academics - Phil Hodkinson, professor of life long learning at Leeds University, Denis Gleeson, professor of education, Warwick University, Dr David James, University of Western England and Dr Keith Postlethwaite, also of Exeter University - are somehow concocting a magic elixir for further education is likely to get up the noses of everyone in the sector. Which is not to say that the five don't have aspirations for their efforts. </p> <p>\"The aim is to deepen understanding of these processes,\" Bloomer says. \"The aspirations are that on the basis of that deeper understanding we can make more informed judgements about educational practice, whether at the individual practitioner level or at national policy level.\" </p> <p>So what do we know already about teaching and learning? Surely they have been raked over more than any other part of the education garden. </p> <p>Apparently not that much in the 16-to-death age group which Bloomer and his colleagues are to concentrate on. But they are not starting with a tabula rasa.

      "bodyText": "As it should do, given the cost, the grandest and most expensive research project into further education will be tossing some big questions around. The biggest, actually: how do students learn and how are they taught? At first sight it seems staggering that we need to ponder these questions. Picture the rage and panic if the pilot of a Jumbo jet taxiing to take off casually informs passengers that he is one of the guinea pigs in an investigation to find out how people fly planes. For fly, substitute teach and learn, and this is effectively what hundreds of students at four colleges around the country will be told by their tutors. Both students and tutors will be key players in the venture, says Professor Martin Bloomer, of Exeter university, who is heading the four-year project from a rather pokey office on the St Luke's college campus. The common research model is for academics to take a detached, lofty view of the people they are observing, like zoologists viewing the antics of cobras safely from behind thick glass, giving the occasional poke with long sticks. Teachers, like the snakes, understandably can react badly to this approach. \"Here the academics and practitioners are partners in the research,\" says Bloomer. \"We want the teachers to lead. We want them to suggest topics to focus on.\" Misunderstanding is inevitable when nitty gritty mysteries like the human gene map or the mechanics of learning are under assault. The local BBC news has just described the four-year research programme as a government-funded venture designed to boost standards across further education. Not an entirely ludicrous precis, surely. The further education limb is an \u00a3815,000 chunk of a \u00a312.5m programme entitled the Teaching and Learning research project, and a good \u00a32m of the cost comes from the Department for Education. Most of the cash can be tracked back to the taxpayer one way or another. And hasn't David Blunkett signalled his wish for educational research which is paid for with public money to have feasible application for teachers and lecturers? The venture is sponsored by the Economic and Social Research Council and is thus independent of government, Bloomer declares. And any suggestion that the professor and his four partner academics - Phil Hodkinson, professor of life long learning at Leeds University, Denis Gleeson, professor of education, Warwick University, Dr David James, University of Western England and Dr Keith Postlethwaite, also of Exeter University - are somehow concocting a magic elixir for further education is likely to get up the noses of everyone in the sector. Which is not to say that the five don't have aspirations for their efforts. \"The aim is to deepen understanding of these processes,\" Bloomer says. \"The aspirations are that on the basis of that deeper understanding we can make more informed judgements about educational practice, whether at the individual practitioner level or at national policy level.\" So what do we know already about teaching and learning? Surely they have been raked over more than any other part of the education garden. Apparently not that much in the 16-to-death age group which Bloomer and his colleagues are to concentrate on. But they are not starting with a tabula rasa. There are theories which have changed through the decades, and Bloomer holds views which he hopes to test. One tenet is the notion of the praxis - the practising of the art or skill - of teaching. Bloomer believes this floats between two extremes: the view - Plato, Locke - that theory informs practice, and the reverse - Aristotle, Kant - that theory is induced from practice. The praxis, he says, is an intermeshing of the practical and theoretical: \"There is a symbiotic relationship between the two.\" He holds the image of the teacher as an autonomous professional continuously trimming the sails and nudging the tiller in response to changing conditions and student needs. \"We want to support teachers in investigating their own personal theory-making in practice and its impact upon practice.\" In the project's opening phase, researchers will establish contact with four teachers at each of the four colleges - Bloomer doesn't want to identify them because arrangements haven't been quite finalised - who will suggest aspects of their work to be focused on. \"The thrust of it will be to examine educational practice in the full complexity of the changing world - that's as sharp as I can get to the focus.\" The five leading academics all have a common interest in the social conditions of learning. \"In the past we've been driven by notions of learning as mentalist, that it takes place in the head.\" Sociologists and psychologists have more recently come to recognise the importance of social and cultural conditions. \"We will be working with the teachers and students in the social relationships, in the cultural contexts each of them bring into their learning.\" Bloomer left his distinguished Birmingham grammar school at 15 in a mutually agreed parting. He had, after all, put poster paint into the school's water tower. After a couple of years, he dropped out of an apprenticeship with British Leyland, headed for 1960s London and did various jobs. He eventually returned to education via teacher training, without A- levels, in his early 20s and then did a masters after teaching for three years. The point is, he says, that his perhaps messy career path is much more common than it is assumed. \"The majority of people have life histories that have not followed the clear trajectory by which they are often described.\" He buys the notion that for most people there are no more jobs for life, that we can expect to make at least three significant career changes. And yet policy lags behind. \"It is embedded in the assumption that 16-year-olds know what they want, will remain the same people and are able to make judgments for life.\" When people want to change direction, the educational system penalises them. It is in his view still hopelessly polarised between academic and vocational.

      "body": "<p>Filling in the grant form was not difficult. Income nil, expenditure unlimited. I exaggerate - we had state benefits of \u00a370 odd a week but that barely covered all the insurance premiums we had been paying in our pre-unemployment days. So Simon, the youngest of our four children who was starting a degree course at Edinburgh University, was awarded a grant that was enough to pay for his accommodation. The student loan just might pay for his food and travel, and perhaps his books. But what about the beer, clothes, phone calls, visits to the cinema, tickets to see a band, all the things that ease the drudgery of study and help you socialise? </p> <p>Our eldest son, who joined the RAF, had been seen off to Cranwell years previously and fully kitted out. In Simon's case, we could give him little more than a few pairs of well-pressed jeans (sorry, anathema to young people) and sweatshirts, none of them new. </p> <p>During that first year he subsisted with his grant and student loan. At home we had little time for our youngest son, obsessed as we were with our own problems of managing on state benefits and wondering how we would pay the next bill. My husband, Peter, was suffering from a loss of identity and feelings of desperation as he was rejected for job after job; while I was trying to focus on the Master's degree I had started. We were also coping with a severely ill parent. </p> <p>So apart from the weekly phone call in which our son always assured us that he was managing, we left him alone. In some ways our lives were running in parallel, all struggling to survive, though I suspect we were managing rather less well financially than he was. At least he was having fun. </p> <p>The end of the first year, apart from exams and partying, is taken up with finding accommodation for the second year with amenable flatmates and, most importantly in Simon's straightened circumstances, with Getting Back the Deposit. This is the equivalent of a month's rent, a considerable sum for a poverty-stricken student. Yet most landlords see it as fair game and an extra bonus on top of the often exploitative rents charged. </p> <p>There is a further expense not built into the grants system. To guarantee reasonable accommodation with like-minded friends, it seems you have to find, and pay rent for, the following year's flat or house from July of the previous academic year - throughout the summer vacation. For most students, including our son, working during the summer is de rigueur. The relevant local authorities insisted we were not entitled to anything extra for the additional adult living with us over the summer. \"He can get a job,\" was the riposte. </p> <p>Easier said than done. With our experience of fighting our way round the system, we admitted defeat. By this time we, too, were depending on handouts from grandparents and our own children. And our debts were spiralling with little prospect of work. A short-term maintenance job in a local factory enabled Simon to keep up his rent payments on his flat, to go out with his mates occasionally, and to give him something extra for the beginning of the next year. Yet we felt guilty we could do so little to support him. While so many of his peers were backpacking or just package-holidaying, he had to stay at home for lack of funds. But conscious of our sensibilities, he never complained. </p> <p>Illness inevitably follows living on a starvation diet and \"burning the candle at both ends\", so it came as no great surprise when Simon rang us in the first term of his second year, to say: \"Mum, I'm in hospital.\" </p> <p>Our son, who had never had a day's absence from school, had developed an abscess in his throat which had to be drained as it was constricting his swallowing. We wanted to rush up there and bring him home but, stoic as ever, he insisted he could cope. His main concern was the exam he had to take in two days' time. </p> <p>With strict instructions to tell his tutor he was taking the exam under the influence of powerful drugs (of the medicinal variety) and was feeling less than well, he sat the exam. We took great comfort from his caring flatmates who visited him in hospital and phoned us about his progress. But less comfort from his 90-minute wait in the wintry conditions of Edinburgh in December for a bus to take him home from the hospital. </p> <p>His second year has been equally stressful financially - he has taken out the maximum student loan - and how he avoided massive debts is a mystery. Yet he has still enjoyed a social life. The vacation will again have to be spent earning enough money to pay his rent over the summer. Fortunately, Edinburgh offers better holiday job prospects than where we live, so we don't know how much we will see him. </p> <p>Now we are in work again and slowly becoming financially more stable. Repossession is no longer a threat. Whatever we are able to send him is always gratefully received though, sadly, we can't afford it often. And no, we would not have wanted him to have lived at home and gone to a local university. Living in a different environment from home and mixing with others is an essential step in a young person's life, and where better to do this than in a vibrant academic environment. </p> <p>How has Simon gained? Apart from having spent four years in a beautiful city, he has probably made lifelong friends, has learned to manage his money and time and, above all, has learned to survive in a situation he may have to face again with an uncertain economic future. </p> <p>For us it's been an uncertain time. While we have enjoyed watching him gain new skills and ideas, the effect of unemployment and fear of the unknown, has been compounded by feelings of guilt at being unable to give him financial and emotional support when it was needed. In fact, it was often he who gave us emotional support. </p> <p>\u0095 This is an extract from How I supported my son or daughter through university, edited by Lynne Boundy (Independent Studies, Lancaster University, supported by the Guardian) \u00a39.95 (inc p&amp;p), tel: 01524 593430, email: <a href=\"mailto:IndStud@lancaster.ac.uk\"> IndStud@lancaster.ac.uk</a> </p> <p> <strong>Students say</strong></p> <p> \"It was hard to ask my parents for money - especially when I needed some extra towards a computer in the second year - because I know it's been a struggle for them to help out with the finances even though I worked part-time throughout my degree.\" </p> <p> \"My mum's having to work full-time, indefinitely, to support three of us through university, while her colleagues are taking early retirement and enjoying themselves.\" </p> <p>\"I didn't communicate very well with my parents, apart from when I was asking for a top-up, but thinking back I think it's essential.\" </p> <p>\"After my parents got divorced, it made it more difficult to get a reasonable allowance - particularly from my dad who has taken on a new young family.

With strict instructions to tell his tutor he was taking the exam under the influence of powerful drugs (of the medicinal variety) and was feeling less than well, he sat the exam. We took great comfort from his caring flatmates who visited him in hospital and phoned us about his progress. But less comfort from his 90-minute wait in the wintry conditions of Edinburgh in December for a bus to take him home from the hospital. His second year has been equally stressful financially - he has taken out the maximum student loan - and how he avoided massive debts is a mystery. Yet he has still enjoyed a social life. The vacation will again have to be spent earning enough money to pay his rent over the summer. Fortunately, Edinburgh offers better holiday job prospects than where we live, so we don't know how much we will see him. Now we are in work again and slowly becoming financially more stable. Repossession is no longer a threat. Whatever we are able to send him is always gratefully received though, sadly, we can't afford it often. And no, we would not have wanted him to have lived at home and gone to a local university. Living in a different environment from home and mixing with others is an essential step in a young person's life, and where better to do this than in a vibrant academic environment. How has Simon gained? Apart from having spent four years in a beautiful city, he has probably made lifelong friends, has learned to manage his money and time and, above all, has learned to survive in a situation he may have to face again with an uncertain economic future. For us it's been an uncertain time. While we have enjoyed watching him gain new skills and ideas, the effect of unemployment and fear of the unknown, has been compounded by feelings of guilt at being unable to give him financial and emotional support when it was needed. In fact, it was often he who gave us emotional support. \u0095 This is an extract from How I supported my son or daughter through university, edited by Lynne Boundy (Independent Studies, Lancaster University, supported by the Guardian) \u00a39.95 (inc p&amp;p), tel: 01524 593430, email: IndStud@lancaster.ac.uk Students say \"It was hard to ask my parents for money - especially when I needed some extra towards a computer in the second year - because I know it's been a struggle for them to help out with the finances even though I worked part-time throughout my degree.\" \"My mum's having to work full-time, indefinitely, to support three of us through university, while her colleagues are taking early retirement and enjoying themselves.\" \"I didn't communicate very well with my parents, apart from when I was asking for a top-up, but thinking back I think it's essential.\" \"After my parents got divorced, it made it more difficult to get a reasonable allowance - particularly from my dad who has taken on a new young family. So he has no idea what it's like for me struggling on a pittance.\" \"Anyone with life skills (like managing money) will be better able to benefit from university. Even smaller people may be advantaged because they need less food to survive.\" \"My parents seemed to think I'd graduate in July with a full-time job lined up straight away.

If you'd happened to bump into John Harmsworth five years ago when he was a chronic alcoholic sleeping rough in Lincoln's Inn Field, you'd almost certainly have written him off as a lost cause.

Within a year of finally kicking the drink, he has completed both a computer and an IT teacher training programme and has worked as an unpaid classroom assistant. And it gets better still. Last week he landed his first paid job for 16 years, when he was appointed a classroom support worker for the Peabody Trust with a salary of \u00a318,000, and on Friday he went to the Dome as one of the five winners of this year's Learning Works awards to celebrate those who have rebuilt their lives through work-based learning. It has been, as John says, \"one hell of a year\". </p> <p>Harmsworth's first steps to recovery began in 1997. \"I received a letter from my daughter which read, \"Dear Dad, I'm getting married, but we think it would be best if you didn't come down.

Universities would be able to opt out of state control and set their own level of fees under one of the proposals in a report by Sir William Taylor, former head of Hull, Huddersfield and Thames Valley universities. </p> <p>Universities say they can't deliver what politicians, employers, students and the public expect from them in the face of continuing funding cuts. The Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals wants a political commitment to a major review of higher education in the next Parliament. </p> <p>Under the privatisation option being presented, universities would have to set aside bursaries for 20% of undergraduates who are from the poorest backgrounds. Other options include higher upfront tuition fees with income-contingent loans; means tested fees increased by 10% each year; fees for limited numbers of courses; full costs fees and scholarships. \"The secretary of state has called for a vigorous debate on higher education funding, on which it appears the government has not yet made up its mind and may not at present be of one mind,\" claims the report for vice-chancellors. </p> <p>Vice-chancellors will be asked to fill in a questionnaire to vote on what issues should influence funding decisions. These range from concerns over student access and acceptibility to students and parents to the revenue potential for institutions and the electoral risk associated with any political backers. Detailed modelling of the funding options will not be completed until the end of the year. </p> <p>Student leaders meanwhile have also attacked the Tory proposals. \"The Conservatives' talk of ensuring some 'access for students from poor backgrounds', though sounding good in principle, begins to resemble the financially elitist funding formula for universities in the US, with Victorian-style handouts to pauper students,\" a statement from the Aldwych Group said. The group shadows the 20 elite university heads of the Russell Group and aims to counteract elitism. </p> <p>Higher education minister Baroness Blackstone will be among the speakers discussing the future of universities during meetings organised by the CVCP and the Association of University Teachers at the Labour party conference in Bournemouth next week.</p>",

Universities would be able to opt out of state control and set their own level of fees under one of the proposals in a report by Sir William Taylor, former head of Hull, Huddersfield and Thames Valley universities. Universities say they can't deliver what politicians, employers, students and the public expect from them in the face of continuing funding cuts. The Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals wants a political commitment to a major review of higher education in the next Parliament. Under the privatisation option being presented, universities would have to set aside bursaries for 20% of undergraduates who are from the poorest backgrounds. Other options include higher upfront tuition fees with income-contingent loans; means tested fees increased by 10% each year; fees for limited numbers of courses; full costs fees and scholarships. \"The secretary of state has called for a vigorous debate on higher education funding, on which it appears the government has not yet made up its mind and may not at present be of one mind,\" claims the report for vice-chancellors. Vice-chancellors will be asked to fill in a questionnaire to vote on what issues should influence funding decisions. These range from concerns over student access and acceptibility to students and parents to the revenue potential for institutions and the electoral risk associated with any political backers. Detailed modelling of the funding options will not be completed until the end of the year. Student leaders meanwhile have also attacked the Tory proposals. \"The Conservatives' talk of ensuring some 'access for students from poor backgrounds', though sounding good in principle, begins to resemble the financially elitist funding formula for universities in the US, with Victorian-style handouts to pauper students,\" a statement from the Aldwych Group said. The group shadows the 20 elite university heads of the Russell Group and aims to counteract elitism. Higher education minister Baroness Blackstone will be among the speakers discussing the future of universities during meetings organised by the CVCP and the Association of University Teachers at the Labour party conference in Bournemouth next week.",

He left school in Stockton at 16 with low CSE grades and was a soldier for 16 years. He left the army with the intention of becoming a nurse, but after the foundation year at Durham University's Stockton site, he discovered he had ability in science. He is about to start his second year of an environmental science degree. His wife, Sarah, 25, left school in Stockton at 16 with nine GCSEs but went on to become a hairdresser. She is about to start the foundation year with the intention of becoming a primary school teacher with a specialism in IT. \"I have done it the hard way. I wish I had had the support to do it when I was 18, that's what I keep telling my kids.\" </p> <p>Sarah says: \"Tim is president of the Stockton campus rowing club. He didn't row before he went to university, but now because of him we're all involved in rowing and I've got to know a lot of people on the campus. It made me think there might be a possibility for me to become a teacher. </p> <p>\"I'd like to teach in the more deprived areas around Stockton. But Tim's children (from a previous relationship), who have come to live with us, are encouraged as well. They say they don't want to be Dad's age when they are studying, they want to be earning lots of money by then. It's making them work harder at school because they can see it's worth it.\"</p>",

She says: \"I wanted to go to a traditional university with the prestige and job opportunities that goes with it. Durham was my first choice; but I also fancied somewhere that was newer and fresh, and the Stockton campus with its more applied degrees seemed to fit the bill for me. \"It's been absolutely brilliant. We have the same lecturers as students in Durham itself, but we enjoy fantastic state-of-the-art facilities and a very friendly atmosphere. There is a lot of support and closeness between lecturers and students. We are like a family, everybody knows everybody and there's a lot of cultural diversity, mature and local students. \"Stockton has the Durham prestige but less of the formality. I really see it as Durham entering the new millennium. This is the way forward.\" Tim Smith, 38, lives in Stockton, is married and has two children. He left school in Stockton at 16 with low CSE grades and was a soldier for 16 years. He left the army with the intention of becoming a nurse, but after the foundation year at Durham University's Stockton site, he discovered he had ability in science. He is about to start his second year of an environmental science degree. His wife, Sarah, 25, left school in Stockton at 16 with nine GCSEs but went on to become a hairdresser. She is about to start the foundation year with the intention of becoming a primary school teacher with a specialism in IT. \"I have done it the hard way. I wish I had had the support to do it when I was 18, that's what I keep telling my kids.\" Sarah says: \"Tim is president of the Stockton campus rowing club. He didn't row before he went to university, but now because of him we're all involved in rowing and I've got to know a lot of people on the campus. It made me think there might be a possibility for me to become a teacher. \"I'd like to teach in the more deprived areas around Stockton. But Tim's children (from a previous relationship), who have come to live with us, are encouraged as well. They say they don't want to be Dad's age when they are studying, they want to be earning lots of money by then. It's making them work harder at school because they can see it's worth it.\"",

The package includes guides to the new national curriculum, special practical subject leaflets, a revamped parents' website and a new termly parents' magazine. </p> <p>Parents are a child's first educator. But whilst parents' role in pre-school is widely recognised, support provided in the home can also make a real difference as children go through school. </p> <p>I know sometimes people say government tries to preach or nanny people too much. But today's campaign is the exact opposite of that approach. It offers a practical guide to the curriculum and tips for those parents who want them. Arming parents with the facts about what's happening in their children's school not only gives them the chance to play a part at home, it empowers them to play a supportive role at school with teachers, too; and it narrows the gap between \"those in the know\" and those unfamiliar with the complexities of the education system. </p> <p>We found that this worked in the National Year of Reading and Maths Year 2000, when millions of leaflets offering practical tips were taken by parents, who told us how valuable they found them. </p> <p>I also know there are some parents who make life a misery for teachers: either by failing to ensure children turn up for classes or by verbally and even physically abusing teachers. We are tackling those problems. But the irresponsibility of a small minority of parents should not distract us from offering the majority of parents the practical support they want. </p> <p>The campaign will use a number of approaches to help parents overcome their concerns about getting more involved in their children's education. </p> <p>The Parents' Guides to the National Curriculum show parents just what their children learn at school and how they can help. There are three guides: one for parents of three- to seven-year-olds, one for parents of seven- to 11-year-olds, and one for parents of secondary pupils [see parents' reviews below]. </p> <p>The guides offer all sorts of ideas for parents, for example when your child has just started primary school, ask them specific questions. What have they done well at? What is more difficult? This helps parents to see what a child is doing and helps children to think about their work. </p> <p>There are plenty of everyday situations where parents can help children aged seven to 11. If they get a takeaway, for instance, they can let their child plan it. Give them a certain amount to spend and see if they succeed in ordering what everyone wants without breaking the budget! </p> <p>For teenagers, revision for exams is best if it's active. Try getting your child to take you through the main points - it is a really good way of consolidating learning. </p> <p>Parents can pick the guides up from schools and libraries, order a free copy (08000 96 66 26) or find them on the web. Parents, children and teachers have \"road-tested\" the guides, and most teaching unions back them, too. </p> <p>We are also publishing a magazine. Parents and Schools magazine will address topical issues - its first issue looks at how to tackle bullying, offers advice on literacy and numeracy and using the internet safely. It is an easy way for busy parents to find out about important school issues. It will be available from retail outlets, including Sainsbury's, Morrisons, Budgens and Lloyds Pharmacies, and from libraries and doctors' surgeries or by calling 0800 389 3899. </p> <p>From today our parents' website is being expanded, giving parents more access to the web. The site includes information on all aspects of education - from bullying and school meals to the curriculum. Its search facility allows parents to hunt for a school in their area and check its results.

Parents online week will give parents a chance to see what computers can do for their family and their children's education. </p> <p>A further plank of the campaign is the publication of the first 12 topic guides, which will arm parents with essential information on popular school topics, such as: electricity, Romans or plants. For example, the Romans leaflet gives ideas for places to visit, and shows you how to make a Roman mosaic with your child. The leaflets can be found on the web at <a href=\"http://www.parents.dfee.gov.uk/discover\">www.parents.dfee.gov.uk/discover </a></p> <p>Taken together, this package opens education to parents in a way which we hope will engage many who may have been put off getting involved in school.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>With due respect to the InterToto Cup, the real European business starts tonight. Over the next two days England's trio of Champions League sides go into battle with one eye on the points column and the other on the bank balance. Welcome back to football's Who Wants To Be A Multi-Millionaire? </p> <p>The glitz and glamour are supposed to be unmistakable. But ask the audience and many will suggest the \"Champions\" tag is ridiculous and the format bloated. The holders Real Madrid started at the Bernabeu in front of 15,000 last year. Arsenal get under way at Sparta Prague this evening having sold only 675 of their 1,200 tickets. </p> <p>Seats in the away end for Leeds's visit to Barcelona tomorrow will be harder to find than the Dennis Bergkamp School of Flying. But then the Nou Camp is slightly more glamorous than the 20,000-seat Letna Stadium, where Arsenal begin their attempt to make it third time lucky by progressing to the next round. </p> <p>This is a competition Ars\u00e8ne Wenger believes he can win but past experience - and Arsenal's previous Champions League openers - goes some way to explaining why. Nwankwo Kanu missed a late penalty in a 0-0 draw at Fiorentina last September; Lens scored a 90th-minute equaliser in France the year before. </p> <p>And, although Wenger remarked yesterday that his team's fate will be decided in the home games - finally being played at Highbury rather than Wembley - this match looks decisive. </p> <p>If Lazio are the obvious group favourites and Ukraine's Shakhtar Donetsk look likely to pick up one of the world's more lucrative wooden spoons, Arsenal and Sparta appear certain to fight it out for second spot. Wenger does not sound short of confidence. </p> <p>\"I have been happy with the spirit and the way we have played but not with the points,\" he said. \"We should be top of the league frankly, without a problem. I keep positive that we have the potential and spirit to do well. We have an inner strength.\" </p> <p>It says much for Wenger's belief that he sees his team as potential winners of this trophy. He feels Lazio are the strongest side and puts Arsenal just behind a main pack in which he also includes Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Manchester United. </p> <p>The abandonment of Wembley should help because on their travels Arsenal have already looked at home. In six away games their only defeat came two seasons ago at Dynamo Kiev. It was defeats by Fiorentina and Barcelona at Wembley last year which, more than anything, cost them. </p> <p>Their defence remains a problem but Wenger knows that already. The German Kicker magazine yesterday claimed that Arsenal are the mystery club behind a big-money bid for Bayer Leverkusen's German international defender Jens Novotny. </p> <p>Sparta's quality is relatively unknown to Wenger, who has had them watched only once. Knocked out in the second phase of last season's competition, they defeated Zimbru Chisinau of Moldova to reach this stage and have won all five of their league matches. </p> <p>Three of their key players have departed for Germany since the summer and two young stars are at the Olympics. Much of the danger is likely to be posed by the 20-year-old midfielder Tomas Rosicky, who played for the Czech Republic at Euro 2000. </p> <p>Patrick Vieira returns for Arsenal despite his league suspension but Wenger will be without Tony Adams, Lauren and Bergkamp. He has doubts over Parlour (knee) and Silvinho (thigh) and, if the Brazilian fails to recover, the 19-year-old Ashley Cole will get a first European start. </p> <p> <strong> Sparta Prague</strong> (4-5-1, possible): Postulka; Bolf, J Novotny, Hasek, P Novotny; Jarosik, Svoboda, Flachbart, Obajdin, Rosicky; Siegl. </p> <p><strong> Arsenal </strong> (4-4-2, possible): Seaman; Dixon, Luzhny, Keown, Silvinho; Parlour, Grimandi, Vieira, Pires; Kanu, Henry.</p>",

      "bodyText": "With due respect to the InterToto Cup, the real European business starts tonight. Over the next two days England's trio of Champions League sides go into battle with one eye on the points column and the other on the bank balance. Welcome back to football's Who Wants To Be A Multi-Millionaire? The glitz and glamour are supposed to be unmistakable. But ask the audience and many will suggest the \"Champions\" tag is ridiculous and the format bloated. The holders Real Madrid started at the Bernabeu in front of 15,000 last year. Arsenal get under way at Sparta Prague this evening having sold only 675 of their 1,200 tickets. Seats in the away end for Leeds's visit to Barcelona tomorrow will be harder to find than the Dennis Bergkamp School of Flying. But then the Nou Camp is slightly more glamorous than the 20,000-seat Letna Stadium, where Arsenal begin their attempt to make it third time lucky by progressing to the next round. This is a competition Ars\u00e8ne Wenger believes he can win but past experience - and Arsenal's previous Champions League openers - goes some way to explaining why. Nwankwo Kanu missed a late penalty in a 0-0 draw at Fiorentina last September; Lens scored a 90th-minute equaliser in France the year before. And, although Wenger remarked yesterday that his team's fate will be decided in the home games - finally being played at Highbury rather than Wembley - this match looks decisive. If Lazio are the obvious group favourites and Ukraine's Shakhtar Donetsk look likely to pick up one of the world's more lucrative wooden spoons, Arsenal and Sparta appear certain to fight it out for second spot. Wenger does not sound short of confidence. \"I have been happy with the spirit and the way we have played but not with the points,\" he said. \"We should be top of the league frankly, without a problem. I keep positive that we have the potential and spirit to do well. We have an inner strength.\" It says much for Wenger's belief that he sees his team as potential winners of this trophy. He feels Lazio are the strongest side and puts Arsenal just behind a main pack in which he also includes Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Manchester United. The abandonment of Wembley should help because on their travels Arsenal have already looked at home. In six away games their only defeat came two seasons ago at Dynamo Kiev. It was defeats by Fiorentina and Barcelona at Wembley last year which, more than anything, cost them. Their defence remains a problem but Wenger knows that already. The German Kicker magazine yesterday claimed that Arsenal are the mystery club behind a big-money bid for Bayer Leverkusen's German international defender Jens Novotny. Sparta's quality is relatively unknown to Wenger, who has had them watched only once. Knocked out in the second phase of last season's competition, they defeated Zimbru Chisinau of Moldova to reach this stage and have won all five of their league matches. Three of their key players have departed for Germany since the summer and two young stars are at the Olympics. Much of the danger is likely to be posed by the 20-year-old midfielder Tomas Rosicky, who played for the Czech Republic at Euro 2000. Patrick Vieira returns for Arsenal despite his league suspension but Wenger will be without Tony Adams, Lauren and Bergkamp. He has doubts over Parlour (knee) and Silvinho (thigh) and, if the Brazilian fails to recover, the 19-year-old Ashley Cole will get a first European start. Sparta Prague (4-5-1, possible): Postulka; Bolf, J Novotny, Hasek, P Novotny; Jarosik, Svoboda, Flachbart, Obajdin, Rosicky; Siegl. Arsenal (4-4-2, possible): Seaman; Dixon, Luzhny, Keown, Silvinho; Parlour, Grimandi, Vieira, Pires; Kanu, Henry.",
